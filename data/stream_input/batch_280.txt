B000002B1M|4.0|ok lemme be simple.  Nas is truly one of the greatest MC's to ever rap, besides Biggie and Tupac.  He is an amazing lyricist with a great knowledge for what people want to hear from rap.  Nas's first album, \\"Illmatic\\" is a modern-day classic that most rap albums are judged by now.  Nas's follow-up to that is a great CD, almost as good as Illmatic.  However, i had major beef with this album.  The main one is that the song \\"Street Dreams\\" is totally ripped off of 2Pac's song \\"All Eyez on Me\\"  I don't know how the hell any true rap listeners did not notice this, or why they overlook it in their reviews.  I'm a diehard Pac fan, so i noticed this in an instant.  I love the song \\"Street Dreams\\" for its lyrics, and its beat, even though it is taken.  the one thing that puzzles me is that Nas does NOT credit 2Pac for this beat in the track's info.  whatever, Pac ripped Nas up for that in \\"Against All Odds.\\"  Moving on, I think that this album represents Nas moving on to a more mature stage of rap, with more of a \\"real\\" approach to his songs.  he brings in DJ Premier on a couple tracks, and yes, Dr.Dre on the song \\"Nas is Coming\\"  every song on this album is listenable, and likeable, for the most part.  he has classic tracks in \\"The Message,\\" \\"Street Dreams,\\" \\"I Gave You Power,\\" and \\"If I Ruled the World.\\"  This 2nd album from Nas is truly something not to be missed, and i only rated this 4 stars because of my beef with Nas.  i love Nas, own all his albums, and i think that this is his 2nd best album, after Illmatic.  to anyone who reads this, don't listen to other reviewers dissing this CD because it isn't the second coming of Illmatic.  Peace
B00003CXE7|5.0|Russell Crowe brings something indescribable to this movie...I think it is a kind of tempered stoicism, a deep sadness to match the gladiatorial exterior.<br />This is a story set in the grandeur of ancient Rome. The emperor does not think his son, Commodus, is fit for the throne, so he plans to make General Maximus, played by Russell Crowe, the next emperor. Commodus overhears, and kills his father, after which he attempts to kill Maximus, but fails.<br />Maximus becomes a low slave, and, eventually, a gladiator. He is heartbroken, for his wife and son have been killed by Commodus. <br />The ending of the movie is bittersweet. Maximus neither entirely triumphs or entirely fails. But this movie is definitely a great one.
B00004STUL|4.0|Though the film is extremely entertaining and the documentary is also enjoyable, the studio needs to release a 'SUPERBIT' version (higher quality video standard that utilizes space on the disc normally reserved for special features for picture quality instead) of this title like they have for 'Vertical Limit', 'Dracula', and 'Johnny Neumonic' to truly earn the 5th star.<br />Unfortunately, Bad Boys looks grainy on a 65&quot; rear projection Widescreen TV when compared to high quality mastered titles like Star Wars, LOTR, and The Rock: The Critereon Edition and Superbit titles, which still looks razor sharp at this size.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|It sometimes seems like geniuses live in their own world, apart from the rest of us. In A Beautiful Mind, John Nash, who would later become a Nobel-prize winning Mathemetician, does live in a world of his own. He is a schizophrenic, unable to distinguish between reality and his own imaginings.<br />The people he has imagined seemed so real that I could feel his world crumble when he discovered that he really wasn't part of a top-secret government organization, and that his jocular college roomate is not real either. <br />Russell Crowe makes an amazing transition from playing a tortured, conflicted man struggling with a greater power(Commodus) in the mask of a gladiator to playing a tortured, conflicted man struggling with a greater power(schizophrenia) in the mask of a genius.<br />This is such a unique story for making a movie about, but it works.
0066214122|4.0|All Michael Crichton has to do is produce a new book every 3 years or so to start the great debates.  Does he preach too much?  Does he really entertain?  Is he a novelist, or just getting rich from publishing because he knows he doesn't have to write, just package the same thrills over and over, and the public will buy?<br /><br />You either enjoy the ride with Crichton, or you hate it.  I personally was overwhelmed and much in favor of \\"Timeline\\", but<br />I know many people thought it atrocious.  With Crichton, I'm really on board for the ride, just to see what he has up his sleeve this time....in Prey, he's done his job - given the reader a different slant on his entertaining premise, that corporate villains will subvert science and technology for their own gains, oblivious to the effect on the human race.  His story holds your interest until the end, and he's done at least some homework in the field of nanotechnology...and only 1 out of 100 readers will be able to catch the flaws.<br /><br />Like as not, when you are reading thrillers, most readers don't expect sound characterization and dialogue, and Crichton tries hard in this arena, and does an adequate job.  But his hero is worth rooting for, and his plot sufficiently engrossing enough to make you stay awake reading far into the night.<br /><br /> I buy and read Crichton for what his books are, and not for what they are not.  I thought \\"Prey\\" was an able attempt to make the public aware of the perils of nanotechnology, while entertaining us all.  I fall short of wanting to see this made into a movie, after the horrendous treatment of \\"Congo\\", but I guess you can't have everything.  And I'm sure that Crichton's next book will be about corporate baddies who risk human lives by perverting science in a nonethical way...and I'll probably buy and enjoy that as well!<br /><br /> Formulaic?  Yes...Entertaining?  Most certainly!  Enjoy!
B00000F14B|4.0|Finally, after watching musicals about all sorts of good people(usually with one or two flaws to make them believable), a musical about a no-good, cheating, swindler!<br />I think the movie starts off a little boring, but its catchy tunes and rhythms soon draw you in. It is a story about Professor Harold Hill(who is not really a professor at all), who sells band instruments and uniforms to unsuspecting kids all over the country, then hops the next train out of town(since he can't read a note of music).<br />Professor Hill lands in the sleepy town of River City, and pretty soon, the whole town is taken in by the idea of a boys' band, all except skeptical Marion Paroo. Slowly, Marion falls in love with the professor, but even she cannot help him when it is discovered that he is nothing but a fraud...
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|While i found the film painfully disturbing, the score/soundtrack evoked many memories from the film, without the tragic pain associated with viewing it.  Not an easy CD to listen to, as it is a score, following the musical progression of the film, as opposed to a soundtrack organized for easy/flowing listening.  Many great emotionally intense peices, performed by a stellar group - Kronos Quartet!
B00005QFE5|5.0|This Chinese movie is without doubt the best movie I have ever seen. This movie has it all: An extremely touching love story, wonderful images, a story that (for me) symbolizes the circle of life... and the beautiful Zhang Ziyi (who became famous in &quot;Hidden Dragon, Crouching Tiger&quot;) is simply incredible. The director Zhang Yimou has made several other movies which are deeply touching, for example &quot;Not one less&quot;.
B00004XONN|3.0|First of all I'd like to give Ryan Trask (Sorry if I didn't get the name right) props for his interpritation of the &quot;story&quot; told in Kid A. That said Kid A as an album is a hard one to review as thier really is only one &quot;traditional&quot; song on it (How to disapear completely) Rather then &quot;traditional&quot; songs radiohead has opted to create several diferent &quot;sounds&quot; and incorperate them into the ten tracks here. Vocals do apear on the album but just as another &quot;Sound&quot; It may take a while to get into but its worth it
0385486804|5.0|I received this novel as a Christmas gift.  By December 26th, I was finished, amazed at its captavating story.  Most of us know at least one person like Chris McCandless, aka Alexander Supertramp.  For me, it's my brother.  What this novel helped me realize is that a lot of kids are like Chris...idealistic.  But usually, they grow up and realize the world is not perfect.  In Chris's case, this epiphony came too late, resulting in a tragic ending to his sojourn away from conventionalism.  Chris's fascinating dialogue, journal entries, and letters are some of the most profound passages I have read.  Both McCandless's and Krakauer's writing styles perfectly explicate McCandless's motives for his journey.  Krakauer, although not chronologically, tells of Alex's treck \\"into the wild\\" using ample research.  The work he must have put into writing this novel is by itself far more than commendable...he even retraced Chris's hitchhiked path to Alaska.  He has managed to brilliantly integrate into McCandless's story the experiences of his fellow escapees, magnifying the controlling idea of the novel:  that material excess is corrupt and salvation lies within nature.  This is at least my grasp of the theme.  Into the Wild is now on the top of my list for a good read, plus narrowly avoidable self-contemplation.  Those that have viewed McCandless's dream as a trivial pursuit into the dangers of the wild simply do not appreciate the youthfullness you must associate with his ideals.  I believe those ideals to be worthy, and McCandless to have been a profound and gifted young man.  I urge you to read this rewarding novel.
B000006NPY|4.0|Knowing how CD now works I'm probobly gonna be recomend Depeche' Mode or somethin' after giving this CD four Stars, however I'm not really in a hurry to pick up something this mellow again, so why'd I give this four stars you ask? Well beside the fact that the Pumpkins are my favorite band I think thier some beutiful tracks on this album such as For Martha Annie Dog and Behold The Night Mare. Those who enjoyed 1979 from melloncholly will probobly enjoy Perfect. While thier are hard songs such as Ava Adore or Aples + Oranges it mostly consists of soft acoustic balads. Its a good buy
B000002GW5|3.0|By the time this album originally came out I already had For Everyman, Late for the Sky and The Pretender.  This was pretty much half my record collection.  I remember thinking at the time that the vinyl was really thin, and would warp.  I instantly liked the title track and 'You love the thunder' as well as 'The Load out/Stay', but have to say that back then I was disappointed with the rest, so much so that I wasn't even particularly disappointed when disc did indeed become unplayable.  I didn't desert Jackson though, who could after listening to a track like title track on 'For Everyman'?  I enjoyed Lawyers in Love and other eighties offerings.  <br />A short while ago I saw Running on Empty in a second hand chuck-out bin.  Dirt cheap.  Time for another listen.  <br />Still no good.  Sorry, I just can't see why this album is so highly rated.  I mean it's all right, but there are many better Jackson Browne offerings.  <br />I don't suppose anyone knows what JB himself regards as his best album?
B00006L9ZT|2.0|I managed to sit through the entire cycle over Christmas. I'm afraid I don't have many positive words to say. I'm not familiar with Wagner's operas and I thought that a production from one of the greatest opera houses of the world might serve as a good introduction. I'm disappointed by what I saw as I found the production to be mostly very boring. Not that it doesn't have any impressive moments. It most certainly has. However, it is not dramatically engaging enough, just like a costume drama which fails to take flight dramatically. The singing is generally OK but the singers don't act that well (fault of the director?). As can be read from the other reviews, I'm sure that some other people can better appreciate this production. Yet, I have to say that I'm not at all impressed by what I see.

B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is the best disney film EVER. It is sooooo good. From the very start to the finish it is the most moving film in the disney arsenal of motion pictures. Made in 1994, the animation was so crytal clear it is as good as todays disney films.<BR>      The VHS of this film is very good, it is the film; a master piece in itself BUT WHEN WILL THE DVD COME OUT!!! as the extra's will be worth the wait I feel. The music if that is your thing is superb, Elton John none the less wrote the large part of the music and in the credits you get his sung version of the songs, but during the animation the music is just as good in true disney style; catchy, extremely catchy and in some places the most evocative and gripping accompanies that almost make the film. I have watched this film many times and I always enjoy it, every time. I am not telling you to buy it, at least rent it to sence it's wonders for yourself.
B00003CXXO|5.0|..while some don't think enough. If I had to rely on the opinions of movie critics, both pro and amateur, I don't think I would have ever bought this movie, and that would have been a huge mistake on my part. I loved this movie, and without divulging too much for those who are still on the fence trying to decide to watch it or not, I'll tell why:<br />1) I got it that the mecha boy took fairy tales to be the truth, that he could relate to the Pinocchio character, and that in his eyes the Blue Fairy in the book could solve his problems for him.<br />2) I got it that the one thing that meant more to him than becoming a real boy was being loved by the only mother he ever knew.<br />3) I was so engrossed start to finish that I didn't realize over two hours had gone by when the credits began to roll.<br />4) I was happy for a movie with no blood, only a brief suggestion of sex, and no guns.<br />5) I got it that the screenwriter wasn't trying to solve all the world's problems with one movie. It was about the boy, and the goal he wanted to reach by the end of the script.<br />6) Young Haley Osment is going to go down as one of the best child actors in history. I thoroughly enjoyed watching him make me believe he really was a robot.<br />As an amateur writer, I have to say that I think it took one heck of an imagination to come up with a story like this. I was impressed with the visuals, even the more poignant ones showing an underwater Manhattan, complete with now-nonexistent Twin Towers. I hadn't been this engrossed by a sci-fi movie since the original Close Encounters of the Third Kind in '78, and I've always thought 2001: A Space Odyssey was pure torture. So, frankly, I'm happy to have been unaware of Kubrick's influence while watching the movie, and even happier to learn that his influence was minimal.<br />Sometimes, you can be too much of a brainiac about a movie. Sometimes, you just have to turn the brain off and let your heart and your eyes enjoy the movie. I did, and I don't regret it. Well done.and I don't regret it. Well done.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Usually when a television series has a special \\"musical\\" episode it's pretty lame. Actors who aren't especially good singers end up performing poorly-chosen, unoriginal material. \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\" is once again the exception--this show continues to amaze even as it gets older. Joss Whedon, the show's creator and principal mover, composed all new music (which resembles Sondheim as filtered through rock) and it turns out his cast is filled with really multi-talented people. Amber Benson is lovely with the soaring \\"Under Your Spell\\" a genuinely moving love song (which turns terribly poignant, as later events in the episode unfold.) Emma Caulfield and Nicholas Brendon are hilarious and touching in \\"I'll Never Tell\\" (and Emma is a riot with \\"Bunnies.\\") James Marsters is never better as the malevolent/love-stricken Spike with the hard-rocking \\"Rest in Peace\\" (a love song sung by a dead man.) Anthony Stewart Head, the acoustic rock god, is affecting in \\"Standing.\\" Sarah Michelle Gellar has a very pure soprano; it's exactly how you would expect the heroic Buffy to sound. When she sings about being pulled out of heaven by her friends, it's heart-wrenching. Her duet with Spike on \\"What You Feel\\" is the emotional climax of the album. This is just exceptional, thrilling music, much more than the usual soundtrack album. If you are not yet a fan of \\"Buffy\\" but are into good music, this is a really good place to start. (The only flaw is that Alyson Hannigan is largely missing in action. Maybe she simply couldn't or wouldn't sing--or maybe because she later turned out to be that season's Big Bad--the villain and Buffy's main adversary--Whedon deliberately left her out. Another provocative mystery for Buffyphiles to ponder.)
B000001F7R|5.0|This awesome debut was released in 1980. I prefer it over Hysteria.Anyways, the sound quality is'nt the greatest, BUT it's the music that matters. ON THROUGH THE NIGHT opens with Rock Brigade, a great rocker. The same goes for Hello America. Sorrow is a Woman, is one of the best ballads I've ever heard, with some neat guitar work from Pete Willis and the late Steve Clark.It Could Be You is a short, fast song. Satellite is an okay song. When the Walls Came Tumblin' Down is (in my opinion) the weakest song on the album. However, Wasted more than makes up for it. The content of the lyrics alone are great, as is the playing. Rocks Off, and It Don't Matter  are okay. Answer to the Master has a great riff, and a coolvocal track from Joe Elliot. The album ends with Overture, which is a pretty neat song.<BR> About the playing: Rick Allen's drumming on the album is just awesome. Who knows what he would be capable of if he hadn't lost one of his arms. Joe's singing isn't at it's greatest, but it's good enough.<BR> All in all, ON THROUGH THE NIGHT is one of Leppard's best. A definite must listen to.<BR>KEY TRACKS: Rock Brigade,Hello America,Wasted,Answer to the Master.
B00006X06U|2.0|I am sorry to see five star reviews for this record.  It is a sorry time,  for sure,  and people are starved for good songs,  work from real song writers, singers, people who have an intrinsic intergrety when it comes to their work. <BR>Joni Mitchell has not made an album worthy of the noteriety she recieves in many many years.  Five stars  -  that belongs only to a classic record.  Joni has never broken ground, (she was never an edging, risk taking artist)  but has rather created beautiful landscapes that are true and clear.  Ground breaking, no.<BR>and though it might have once been 'risky' to her career to work with &quot;jazz&quot; musicians,  there was no ground breaking music that came of it.<br />Veedon Fleece,  Astral Weeks.  Sgt. Pepper,  Nevermind,  A walk across the rooftops,  Pirates, Blue, Everybody Knows this is Nowhere,  Sticky Fingers,  five stars, all.  <BR>It is desperate to say this travelogue,  i mean even the title tells us how uninteresting this is going to be. <br />How can any of these reviews be taken seriously?  joni is tired, her work is tired,  her producer is unispired.  She could go on doing what she does if she was interested in it.  But, as one reviewer put it,  she has become terribly 'preachy'  and preachy with bitterness.  Her love affairs are as interesting to us as they are to her.  Perhaps she had always wanted to work with an archestra, and had identified herself as a jazz (never!) singer, or a folk singer, and so finally got around to this.  Then maybe it sold so....  She seems undefined now. It would be a disrespect to say her definition is her past.  who would want that? so, who is she now?<br /> It would have been better, maybe, articstically speaking, if she had not made these last few records.  I know it is a mediocre time, and maybe these medicore cd's bring digestible music to uninformed, unsophisticated, ...ok.  but for old fans to call this record adventurous is just desperate...  it is a misadventure at best. <br />She was a lovely self relient creature long ago.  That in itself offered hope to people.  Where is the hope now?  so much ego.<BR>So much ego and so little music to offer.

B00005JKDR|5.0|This DVD has to be one of the most incredible animated kids movies I have ever seen. The kids can watch it over and over without wearing it out, and I really enjoyed the bonus features on the second disc. There is so much on there that it takes quite a while to get through it, but definitely worth watching.<BR>For those who are worried about the 'scary' factor: It is not a scary movie at all. My twin 4-year-olds describe the monsters as being 'cute'.  What is funny about the movie is that the monsters are afraid of kids than the kids are of the monsters. The story has quickly become the household favorite, and I admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it as an adult! <BR>If you already have the VHS and are considering the DVD, I can tell you that it is a must-buy. You get all the bonus footage that is not on the tape, plus the colors/detail is amazing. It almost feels as if you are there on the set, even though it is animated. Sully is the most impressive of all with the realistic movement of each hair, but each character is unique and fun to watch. You can choose between widescreen and full screen, so you don't have to worry about buying the wrong DVD format.<BR>Overall, it was entertaining and a joy to watch. My entire family wholeheartedly recommends Monsters, Inc.

While it took a little convincing for his wife, Nora, the Kranks agree to restrict Christmas spending, Christmas decorations and Christmas parties and instead spend their money on a cruise.<br />However, the Kranks learn that thier new Christmas activities, or the lack thereof, may be more of a headache and disaster than they planned for.<br />With many laughs along the way, Grisham tells a wonderful, festive story with true Christmas spirit shining through in the end.
0679777547|4.0|This is a literature-loving whodunit. The main character, Lucas Corso, tries to unravel the mysteries of two texts, one a supposedly original chapter from The Three Musketeers and the other an ancient guide to contacting the devil. He is helped and hindered by a fascinating group of characters as he muddles his way to the end. I was engaged the entire way and gratified by the twist near the end. I enjoyed this book a great deal even though I haven't yet read Dumas; this book has inspired me to correct that omission.
0066214122|4.0|Another Crichton novel, and like all the others I read it cover to cover in one sitting.  Unfortunately, the similarities don't stop there.  The plot is a 21st century update of the Andromeda Strain, with elements of Jurassic Park thrown in for good measure (even the 'iterations' preceding each part).  Parts of the book come off as techno-preachy as Chrichton warns us once again of the (legitimate) risks that we meddlesome humans are stirring up.  But complaints aside, this is still a great novel by any standards.  Just knock off a star because it's not his best.
B00005JKL8|3.0|Behind Enemy Lines it's with no doubt a good action movie, but you just can't compare it to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" or other masterpieces of its genre. The director follows Tony Scott's style and has gained quite a successful result; Chris Burnett and the great Gene Hackman proved very suitable to their roles. The sad not is the plot, which lacks of any originality and sometimes seems quite unrealistic (a whole army shoots at Owen Wilson and they all miss the mark?) but the action scenes above the average give it some interest.<BR>On the technical side the Dolby Digital and, especially, the DTS track are very good and they really challenge your home theatre thanks to the big explosions provided by the context. The video quality is faultless too, though sometimes colours tend to be a little bit too washy.<BR>To sum up, I would recommend \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" to all the fans of war-action movies and to every who needs to refresh its patriotism.
B000069HKH|5.0|There are some albums you don't know how to review because they are so good that you can't make words fit the experience. Plenty of folks have talked about all sorts of aspects about this album, so I'll just say a few things. First, there isn't a single track that is weak or worth skipping, it is a great collection of music. Second, this is excellent music. I buy many many albums, more than I can learn because I like to constantly hear fresh music. Since I've gotten this album I keep listening to it over and over and over and over (and I got it during a binge when I bought about 10 other top notch albums.) Its great rock and roll songs with Dylanesque lyricism and delivery. My apologies, I mean springsteenesque, you don't need comparisons. Finally, it is filled with serious emotion and will no doubt spur deep thoughts about appreciating your own life and all the gifts you have if you're still around to listen to it after the tragedy that hit our nation. And if you're worried about the treatment recieved by such a devastating subject, rest assured Springsteen has given the best eulogy ever.  How do you react to one of the most devastating trajedies ever?  You honor the victims with months of dedicated and focused work, accomplishing a triumphant album in their memory so that the rest of us don't just let things dissapear like nothing ever happened, and gives a intimate feel of the lives that were forever touched.  Don't wait, get the best album in the last while.
B00006DEFA|4.0|I was way too young to have seen AMADEUS in its original cinematic release (unfortunately), but it's not hard to see why it not only took home the Best Picture Oscar, but caused a rebirth of \\"Mozart mania\\". The story, although fictionalized, is an intriguing one. Salieri, the pious man who prayed to God to be given sublime musical talent, has to face the fact that God has given it to Mozart, who is exuberant, childish, and bawdy. Salieri's subsequent jealousy drives the entire movie. You can see his character becoming more and more consumed by his extremely negative feelings. The character of Mozart, on the other hand, is fun, even though the real Mozart wasn't really that over-the-top. I might add, however, that the distinguishing giggle is actually historically accurate. Listen to the commentary on the DVD and Peter Shaffer himself even mentions something to that effect. Although it was delightful to see the film in its entirety, I could see why some of the scenes were deleted. They simply weren't that strong or they distracted the viewer from the main focus. The only real complaint I had was that there weren't more extras. It does have the commentary, the original trailer, and the short featurette which consists of various people looking back at making the film, but I would have liked to have seen an actual \\"making of\\" documentary from around the time the film was being made. Overall, though, a worthy addition to any movie collection.
B000066NW0|5.0|Great CD! She has a lot of feeling in her lyrics. She will have you hooked when listening. Woke up this morning with &quot;I'm with you&quot; playing in my head. A &quot;GOT TO HAVE&quot; album! By the way, I'm in my 40's and have followed music for a long time and this is gotta be the best new material to come out in a long time! From a &quot;old rocker&quot; to the younger ones, this is a must have!
B000002LFZ|4.0|Fleetwood Mac is one of my favorite classic rock bands, though I am more of a Stevie Nicks fan. It's no big surprise, then, that my favorite FM songs are the ones Stevie leads, like &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; &quot;Gypsy,&quot; &quot;Dreams,&quot; and &quot;Sara&quot; (a favorite since my name's Sara, and this is one of the few songs where the spelling's the same). In my opinion, Stevie Nicks' distinctive voice is one of the best attributes of FM.<br />Visually, there's not much to the booklet, just a couple dozen black-and-white photos of the band, as well as a brief two-page account of a 1988 UK concert. There are also a few hits that seem to be missing, like &quot;Landslide,&quot; &quot;The Chain,&quot; and &quot;Gold Dust Woman.&quot; But as they say, you can't please everybody on a greatest hits album. Yet this CD still gets the job done and is worth owning if you're a FM fan. However, I'd recommend listening to &quot;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac&quot; instead for the complete hits of FM.
B000059QY3|1.0|On her web site, the first words you see is \\"World's Greatest Living Soprano\\". Unless I am missing something, some of the world greatest are still alive. This attitude now permiates everything Angela Gheorghiu does. Her acting is all about saying to the world \\"look at me, aren't I perfect?\\" There's an awful lack of any real feeling to her singing AND acting, everything is \\"plastic\\", just like in the world of pop music. The singing itself is breathy; \\"Semre Libera\\" is just chirpy, with weird facial expressions added. Yes, Angela is an attractive woman, but that's really about it. Try to for a moment to take a sober look at her performance itself, without being dazzled by good looks alone and you will see. Besides, she looks way too healthy on \\"deathbed\\" it's laughable. There are plenty of great Violettas recorded (just listen to Cortubas) or taped (Stratas). NONE (even a real diva Maria Callas) added so much arrogance to this role, Violetta is supposed to be vulnerable (!).<br />Frank Lopardo does a better job, but his lackluster middle register makes Alfredo sound rather dull, his acting is quite stiff, particularly set against wind-up toy movements of Gheorghiu. Leo Nucci is an okay Germont-per&eacute;. His essentially lyric baritone does not have the weight and authority of an old, callous entirely unpleasant character; he comes across more as a disillusioned romantic.<br />The real star of this performance is the late Sir Georg Solti. Even though Gheorghiu in her recent interview claimed that he just let her do her thing, he actually balanced and directed the performance with a firm hand. Of course, Kleiber, for instance, brought our more nuance, but Solti managed to enliven what would otherwise be a rather dull number.<br />Final note, when an artist this young aspires to be the \\"word's greatest\\" by simply wearing this title on her chest, it tends to take away a lot from the artistry itself.

B00005JLS0|4.0|This is a throughly enjoyable, light as air movie that you should go to see when you just want to relax, smile a lot and spend some time watching Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock have fun. No serious message, no real surprise twists and turns; but despite being totally formulaic it was a traet and we and the rest of the audience were often laughing out loud.<br />Sandra Bullock is Lucy, a dedicated environmental lawyer following in the \\"do good save the world\\" footsteps of her parents. Hugh Grant is the rich shallow playboy developer whose project she wants to halt. He shocks her by offering to hire her; they strike a deal to save her beloved Coney Island neighborhood center from the wrecker's ball in return for her becoming his counsel. Of course, she soon becomes his indispensable aide, eventually becomes disillusioned, and gives her TWO WEEKS NOTICE. Her relacement invokes jealousy in Lucy, the community center is about to be demolished due to George's brother's (and partner) efforts to make their project profitable after cost overruns, and Lucy heads back to her former life in her parent's cramped apartment.<br />Of course, what the moviegoers have always known is by now dawning on George and Lucy. Namely, they may be as different as day and night but will be miserable without each other. And, so, in the tradition of such feel good films, George overwhelms Lucy with the grand romantic gesture and after some initial confusion and ambilavence she eventually overcomes her doubts and recognizes her true feelings for him.<br />The pace is right, the jokes mostly work, and the supporting cast is more than adequate. So, go see this when you are in the mood for fun rather than adventure, drama, tension, action or deep meaning. It is about on par from the usual work of Bullock and Grant, but if you are a dedicated fan of either don't expect it to measure up to their best work; the material just isn't stong enough.

Adult viewers will find much that is humorous, and garner some food for thought as well.<br />The songs are adorable!  Adults and children alike will sing them and smile.<br />A note about violence.  Some have suggested that this movie is too rough for young children.  To the contrary, the action scenes were realistic (remember that this is children's animation!) and necessary.  The violence played an unfortunate but requisite role in the &quot;circle of life&quot; the story portrayed.<br />I may be a bit behind, but am looking forward to viewing the sequel.

B00005JKZT|5.0|To believe that just last year I wouldn't have had the slightest interest in watching The Lord of the Rings. But, it was 2 to 1, odds against me and I found myself watching a movie I'd watch 13 more times afterwards! And that was The Fellowship of the Ring alone.<BR>I was excited about The Two Towers coming out. I bought advanced tickets for the release date. It is as good as the first.<BR>My friend who loved the movie as well said she didn't like it as much. I will warn you that The Two Towers is very dark! But what do you expect? It is in the middle of the trilogy. Lots of fighting going on but comic relief is offered my Gimli and Legolas who have formed a friendship.<BR>I really enjoyed Gollum in this movie. It was fun to watch him as a schizophrenic creature!<BR>All the characters are excellent in this movie including the newly introduced ones whom you'll meet when you go see it.
B000002JKA|5.0|I don't see why many DT fans don't really like this album. I sure do. It's signature DT, with a darker tone to it. The album cover is a somewhat drastic change from that of Images and Words. The abstract collage look is there, but shades of red and gold are replaced with blue and silver. A subtle difference, but the music has been impacted. For better or for worse, it's the listeners' call. Before I do a track-by-track synapsis, I can say that the music DT make on here is a mix of Metallica, Rush, Faith No More, U2, and Depeche Mode.<br />1. 6:00- 8/10 The opening drum fill by Mike Portnoy is a hook grabbing the listener, but the full ensemble's sound is a little keyboard-heavy and cheesy as a result. James LaBrie tries to snarl like Dave Mustaine, and it doesn't really work. An okay opener(lyrics are pretty good).<br />2. Caught In A Web- 10/10 The first superb track on the album, with a nice bang of a beginning(keyboards much better this time). The lyrics are thought-provoking, and the chorus is brilliantly done. The bridge/middle-section is very technical and the pounding riffs are really catchy. Who says this music is emotionless?<br />3. Innocence Faded- 9/10 Done somewhat like the tracks on I&W. Much lighter than the 80's styled metallic riffs on the last two numbers. I like the 'mood' given off by the song. Nice chorus.<br />--A Mind Beside Itself--<BR>***This concept song takes up the next 3 tracks***<br />4. Erotomania- 7/10 A challenging instrumental that, in my book, really goes nowhere. Nice keys in here, though. Kevin Moore definitely had something Jordan Rudess doesn't.<br />5. Voices- 6/10 A 10-minute song that also goes nowhere. The solos by John Petrucci are flashy as usual(not that it's a bad thing), but the song drags way too long.<br />6. The Silent Man- 10/10 The last part of the trio is like a hammer pulling the last few nails OUT of the coffin. It is an excellent ballad-esque song, with great acoustic guitar, and a sing-a-long chorus. LaBrie gives a rather emotional performance.<br />7. The Mirror- 9/10 A potential rocker that could've worked better, but I like it for what it is. The classic vocal trade-off thing betwen Mike and James(where Mike growls a word and James then sings a line) is present, later to be seen in \\"The Glass Prison\\" off Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. The keyboards add a menacing atmosphere to the song, and the last minute or so is pure genius.<br />8. Lie- 10/10 A nice metal song, complete with shortened video version(nice video, btw). DT prove that they can pull off Metallica-styled metal. TWO awesome solos by Petrucci.<br />9. Lifting Shadows Off A Dream- 11/10 Juvenile, I know, but the song is unbelievable. John Myung wrote the amazing lyrics, and the whole song has a U2-with-keyboards feel that is amazing. LaBrie shows a lot of vocal control here, and it really shows. My favorite tune off here.<br />10. Scarred- 8/10 A better epic than \\"Voices\\". It starts off nice and funky, with Myung taking the spotlight. The song later gets a rock/orchestra feel as it progresses.<br />11. Space-Dye Vest- 8/10 Kevin's piano lines at the beginning are nice and classical-sounding, and James's singing is captivating(Depeche Mode-styled, though). However, the 'samples' or whatever, really detract from the song, and it can't compare with the beauty of \\"The Silent Man\\" or the brilliance of \\"Lifting Shadows...\\"<br />So there. Dream Theater's 1994 epic album, Awake. Not to be confused with the Godsmack opus of the same name. It's a shame the follow-up album, Falling Into Infinity, wasn't nearly as good(not nearly as heavy). The other albums are up to par, and surpass it slightly in one way or another. To the newcomer, get I&W first, or Six Degrees. LaBrie, well you love him or hate him, and on this album newbies might head for the latter.
B000002LBH|5.0|Something of a classic among punk fans, Louder than Bombs is the Smiths at their best.  Some really great tunes are on this album including Is it really so Strange, Girl Afraid, Heaven Knows I'm miserable now (gotta appreciate the optimism that is Morrissey's trademark eh?), Oscillate Wildly, and many others.  Combining music that set the trend for other would-be alternative bands, the Smiths reached their apogee with this album and with a combination of insightful lyrics that are both seemingly bleak and realistic as well as music that will make you move with its rocking sounds, this album is definitely worth owning especially because some of the songs on this album aren't found on the greatest hits cds which I also own.  Much as I still like Morrissey, I prefer him with Johnny Marr and the Smiths.  Anyway, for all you would-be retro music enthusiasts, goths, and other youngsters, go get this album and satiate that longing within you to be melancholy with style!

6303824382|4.0|If you ignore the plot holes the size of Al Roker, \\"Die Hard with a Vengeance\\" is a fun, action-packed ride starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. When a mad bomber has taken practically the whole city of New York hostage, John McClane and civillian Zeus (Jackson) race to figure out the puzzle crafted for them by the mysterious Simon (Jeremy Irons). Now, the big question is: how in the world could one man plant all of these bombs around the city without someone finally noticing them? But no matter.

B00000DCHE|5.0|The true test of a musical genius is the ability to perform live on stage. You can take many artists out of a studio and put them on stage and they are an embarassment. This is not the case with Billy Joel. His vocals are amazing as he rocks through songs like &quot;Los Angelenos&quot; and breaks our hearts with bittersweet songs like &quot;Summer/Highland Falls &amp; the amazing &quot;I've Loved These Days&quot;. His magic and talents are all highlighted on the live stage. Billy never sings a song the same. Songs in the Attic takes some of Billy's best written songs and brings them to life. From the epic &quot;Miami 2017&quot; to the phsycalledic favorite &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, Billy is at the top of his game here. Many of Billy's best songs are not the hits, they are the B-sides. Songs like &quot;Streetlife Serenader&quot; with it's haunting narration of a homeless street performer and &quot;Everybody Loves You Now&quot; with it's cynical and sarcastic view of his own life really pack a whollup. Kids of today that follow what currently is called &quot;music&quot; should grow up and listen to what a musician really is.<br />Billy Joel is one of the greatest songwriters and performers of the 20th century and Songs in the Attic proves it!
0066214122|3.0|The story's okay; not bad, not great either, definitely not his best. It starts slowly, graduates in the second third, and then it keeps the pace till the end, which doesn't bring any big surprises though; not for an observant reader anyway. The author made several mistakes when explaining software related topics. For example, the passage about recursive algorithms is not exactly correct, and the one code example he used is so bad it made me think Crichton's software advisor had to work for Apple, part-time at least.<BR>The book reads more like a movie script than a novel. I think there's a great movie potential in this book. Actually, this could be the first movie based on a Crichton's novel that could be better then the original. I hope so.<BR>Don't let these negative comments of mine to dissuade you from reading this novel. It's still a Michael Crichton, after all. Chances are if you liked his other novels you will probably enjoy Prey as well.
0596000480|5.0|As a developer with experience in many other languages (C, C++, C#, VB, etc), this book has turned out to be an excellent learning tool and reference for me. It covers the basic important aspects of JavaScript that you would expect in any book covering a development language, but without being too basic or tedious. Reading moves along quickly and there are just the right number and quality of examples to demonstrate concepts without being too vague or trivial. The author also does a great job of anticipating probing questions that you may have in exploring a topic further. <br />I highly recommend this book!
B00006BTCA|5.0|I won't bore anyone with a long review.  All I will say is that  you should not buy this if you are expecting another Strokes/Hives/Vines album.  This instead is a MUST for all fans of very early 80's post-punk.  I don't really hear Joy Division as most critics point out, but I do hear all those bands that came after Joy Division.  The sound reminds me of pieces of the first Furs album, Theatre of Hate, March Violets and every 4AD album of that era.  <br />Not a bad song on the CD.
0066214122|5.0|Crichton returns to top form with &quot;Prey&quot;. This time out his protagonist must deal with an apparent crisis at a fabrication plant in Nevada. Jack Forman is a programmer, and presumably the underlying difficulty is a code glitch, but events seems to implicate the plant's use of nanotechnology, and some mysterious behavior by Jack's wife, a top executive at the fabrication plant.<br />None of these elements would distinguish this book from a hundred other thrillers, but Crichton brings some special ingredients to the mix: fewer cliches than most of his peers, though more than I would have liked; a plausible technology well backed by information; a slick writing style that goes down like ice cream; more attention to character development than usual.<br />As compared with some recent Crichton efforts, notably &quot;Timeline&quot; and &quot;Airframe&quot; this book is taut and quite brief. The characters are better written, the situations much less implausible. This book marks a return to the form of &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; Most of the action occurs within a forty-eight hour period, and Crichton does a good job of showing how the limits of time and the characters' knowledge of the situation restrict their choices. I believe that some other reviewers considered these &quot;holes&quot; in the plot, but I cannot agree. Jack would have done things differently had he known what he was getting into, but he plausibly does not know these things.<br />The technology under discussion here, nanotechnology, has been a fixture of science fiction and science speculation for over fifteen years. Experienced SciFi readers might approach this book with a certain amount of reserve, wondering why it took Crichton so long to follow Drexler, &quot;Blood Music&quot;, &quot;Gryphon&quot;, &quot;Nanotech Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Assemblers of Infinity&quot; and &quot;Aristoi&quot;, among others.But Crichton writes thrillers, rather than pure Science Fiction, and his  take on nanotechnology owes as much to population biology, artificial life, emergent behavior, and microbial behavior as it does to K. Eric Drexler. He has clearly read a good deal, his bibliography was lovely, and he only fell into the didactic mode about 5 times during the novel-- not much for Crichton.<br />&quot;Prey&quot; is told in the first person, and the character of Jack Forman dominates the novel.  Crichton invests far more effort than usual in giving Jack depth, and the results are quite pleasing. Much of the early section of the book takes place against the backdrop of Jack's career as a stay-at-home Dad, buying place mats and picking kids up from soccer practice. Some readers, seeking escape from a similar life, will not find this part entertaining. But it does ground Jack's character in a reality different from the technocrisis, a new twist for Crichton.<br />As stated above, the book is quite brief, and seems shorter than it is. The climax and ending come with the speed of a short story, and the resolution seems to make far too little emotional impact on the protagonist.  The emphasis on Jack also drains most of the life out of the other characters--- they are mere acquaintances of Jack's, and it shows.  None of this really detracts from the book, and the refusal to milk the ending may simply show restraint by a seasoned writer.<br />I confess that I am writing this review because I find too many of the other posted reviews unjustly harsh. Comparing &quot;Prey&quot; with recent work by Clancy, Preston and Child, and other work by Crichton himself makes this book look even better. It has definite limitations, to be sure, but within those it has a richness the competition can only envy.
0066214122|3.0|The science is well researched and interesting, but told as too much exposition and not enough  worked into the story itself.  The characters are reaonably well drawn, and the silicon valley atmosphere (before the crash) is recognizable although a little too much of a stereotyype.  <br />The first two thirds of the story run well, but starts to get fantastic towards the end and the denouement is a little too far fetched, although if you can manage a willing suspension of disbelief it's quite thirlling.  It does manage to keep you guessing to the end.<br />If you like Crichton you should like this somewhat formulaic novel, and for sci fi fans generally it's worth a read.  Not the kind of book you are likely to read more than once.<br />It does have a good bibliography for those who want to follow up on the science.<br />The Amazon editor provides a good plot outline.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I will say that when I heard that Steve Perry was not on lead vocals, I was skeptical. I never thought anyone could sound like Perry.  After hearing the first song, I was amazed.  Steve Augeri can sing note for note with Perry.  I actually think they sound better with Augeri because I don't believe Perry can still hit those notes plus Augeri brings youthfullness to the band.  The band never sounded better.  The audio is incredible on this.  If you want a state-of-the-art DVD with unparalled quality, you must get this.  You definitely will be glad you made this purchase.
B00006WUWP|5.0|Although the first two entries in Austin Powers series were definitely worth a look, the latest entry of \\"Goldmember\\" is by far the funniest of the three.<br /><br />Everything about \\"Goldmember\\" is more.  More action, more humor, more flash, more excitement, and certainly more character developement which actually adds a history to the characters.  You know right from the false start when the familiar theme begins as famous movie stars play all the Austin characters,  you're in for a treat.  I liked the appearance of Steven Spielberg and the amusing dance vignette with Brittney Spears too.  After being entertained for several minutes with the pre-show, the main attraction begins.<br /><br />In this third of the series,  Mike Myers is funnier than ever before, and alter ego Dr. Evil is far more developed in his role too.  In this adventure, Austin goes back to the seventies disco era to find \\"Goldmember\\" a \\"crazy dutch bastard\\" according to Dr. Evil who has such a irrepressible fondness for the precious metal, that he has suffered \\"an unfortunate smelting accident\\" that literally turned his \\"member\\" to gold!  Talk about the \\"Midas Touch\\"!  Austin travels in his time machine car to the 1975 and lands in a flashy disco called what else, \\"Studio 69\\" of course.  It is there that he reunites with Foxy Cleopatra played by singer Beyonce Knowles in her acting debut.  Her character, replete with an impossibly huge afro and big bell bottoms, is a combination send-up of Pam Grier's character \\"Foxy Brown\\" and Tamara Dobsons \\"Cleopatra Jones\\" of the same era.  There is so much slapstick visual humor in this scene, between the rollerskating double-jointed Goldmember doing impossible kicks, and especially when Austin and Foxy talk without being noticed as a effeminate man sits in between and mouths Foxys every word with the appropriate gestures topped with a big smoochy kiss.  Just the beginning of the fun.<br /><br />Austin and Foxy decide to team up.  They will go back to the future together where in 2002, she will help save Austins father played by wonderful veteran actor Michael Caine, in a perfectly casted role.  Caine is the quintessential mature British Male, and his air of sophistication is a wonderful touch in contrast to all the absurdity going on in the rest of the movie.  Despite his being the absentee Dad while Austin was growing up, Austin is determined to save dad from the skin eating Goldmember who has kidnapped him. What happens next, and what shocking family secret has been revealed?  Watch and see.<br /><br />I found this film hilarious from beginning to end.  Dr. Evil is the funniest yet in this edition. The only moment he wasn't was the jailhouse rap scene.  I hated the rapping scene in \\"shagged\\" and it certainly wasn't needed in a reprise here either.  That part aside, all the usual fun geeks and freaks are funnier than ever.  Frau Farbisina, Seth Greene with a new Hair-don't as son of Evil, Robert Wagner as the ever sombre Number Two, Mini-Me on a chocolate eating bender, the return of a more corpulent than ever Fat Bastard, now as a Sumo Wrestler and at a pinnacle of repugnancy!  Silliest of all, Fred Savage as a moll replete with an actual huge facial MOLE.  This mole horrifies  both Austin and Dr. Evil to the point of distraction and the facial expressions and malaprops that ensue are a comic mole-sterpiece.

B00000IP2L|4.0|What can be said about Zakk Wylde that hasn't already been said?  The man is the guitar god of his time, and can shred like no other modern day guitarist out there today.  \\"Sonic Brew\\", Zakk's first release under his Black Label Society title, is a full throttle smash some beer bottles against the wall hard rock that fans of old Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, or early Pantera will no doubt dig.  Opening track \\"Bored to Tears\\" has become a live staple of Zakk's (one listen to it and you'll know why), while \\"Born to Lose\\", \\"Mother Mary\\", and \\"Lost My Better Half\\" are utterly amazing songs which shows Zakk pouring all his emotion into his guitar, and his soulful but borderline death metal growl of a voice is music to any metalhead's ears.  My personal favorite song is \\"Hey You (Batch of Lies)\\" which is undeniably heavy and has quite a catchy chorus that will stick in your head for quite a while.  Other songs like \\"Black Pearl\\" and \\"World of Trouble\\" sound a bit like filler material, but don't take away much of the greatness of \\"Sonic Brew\\".  All in all, this is a great pick up for fans of Zakk or for those looking for something truly heavy and melodic with some major guitar talents.  Pick up the BLS follow up to this, 2000's \\"Stronger Than Death\\", which I consider Zakk and co. at their apex.
B00003W8NM|4.0|I'll be honest, the first time i watched this movie, i hated it. I thought it was the worse movie of 99, a complete waste of time, film and talent. I didn't get it, the end just left me completly lost, why people called it one of the years best confused me even more.<br />A few months later, my cousin asked me if i had ever seen it, and i told her i did and that i wasn't fond of it. A week later, she had convinced me to give it a second try (this kinda thing runs in the family blood). A month after that i find it on HBO or some other channel and decided why not try it again.<br />This is one of those movies that needs to be viewed twice, and i know reviews usually say something along the movies plot line, but to do that with Fight Club might risk giving something away. It isn't your regular, 'you've seen one and you've seen them all' movie, it's differnt, kinda a depressing differnent, but still in a good way (the second time around). It makes me wonder if i should give Vanilla Sky and Magnolia another try, tho the later you might have to threaten me with a root cannel before i agree to waste another 4 hours of my life away.

B00007G1ZM|5.0|Joan Crawford at her big shouldered ( by any definition ) best, suffers and triumphs as the long suffering wife of a lackluster husband, only to fall prey to a remarkable trio of villians - her ex's former business partner and lurking Romeo, the oily and wily ne'er-do-well playboy / social weasel and last, by not least, the ungrateful and social climbing daughter from Hell. Her tart and feisty and incredibly smart-mouthed friend fires off the classic line, now well quoted, but very apt nonethless. This film noir piece is a Curtiz gem, long overdue on DVD. Joan makes you believe she was really baking those pies and frying that chicken, because she's in the kitchen, scooting from stove to cabinet with ease and determination. Her eyes showing every emotion, as she takes you along with her on a life half full, half empty. Kudos to all, even that nasty Ann Blythe.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is hands down, the best movie I have ever seen. Before this, it was Saving Private Ryan, but Band of Brothers blew SPR right out of the water. It is truly amazing how those young men held up over their time in Europe. I was hesitant at first to watch this movie because I thought it was going to be an elongated Saving Private Ryan. The previews had the same look as SPR and it was made by the same people. But B.o.B. is in a class unto it's self. The depth of this movie is un-matched. By the end, you feel like you have been there fighting with those men, you consider them you brothers. You feel saddened when one dies. This movie draws you in like no other. I rented the first two episodes and after viewing them I immediately bought the box set. If you want to know what real honor and courage is like, get this movie.
6302814359|3.0|The first Return of the Living Dead (thank God its finally on DVD) was an instant classic, and the filmakers of this sequel decided to throw any kind of seriousness out the door completely and offer up some laugh out loud zombified fun.  Thom Matthews and James Karen return to their roles from the original, this time a few kids discover a broken cannister which soon leads to zombies taking over the entire town.  As with the first film, these zombies aren't just stumbling around; they are fast, smart, and vicious, but the film itself isn't scary or even overly gory for the most part, its just intentionally funny (by the time the Michael Jackson \\"Thriller\\" zomie jumps in out of nowhere during the electricution scene at the end I was literally rolling around the floor laughing like an idiot), but horror fans looking to take this seriously will hate it.  All in all, those looking for a horror/comedy with some brains (no pun intended) should be satisfied with this.  Look for X-Files and Shocker alumnus Mitch Pileggi in a cameo.
0345440900|4.0|I had my 3rd child 7 weeks ago, and I'm sad to admit that this is the very first newborn that I've actually enjoyed. I owe some of this joy to having read and applied this book. My friend recommended this book to me and I read it before my son was born. I had mixed feelings about Tracy's ideas, having done demand feeding/co-sleeping with my first 2 kids. BUT, I remembered the pain of long months and months of the first 2 waking several times a night to nurse, and of them wanting to nurse all day long. Now I know that some mothers don't mind this, and feel that it's the best for the baby, but even though my babies were doing well, I wasn't. I have read the reviews criticizing Tracy's method, and saying that newborns on a schedule have 'failure to thrive'. Honestly, I've often thought that without any type of schedule, it's the mom who has failure to thrive. After doing 2 babies the 'other' way, I was ready to experiment with a different philosophy. <br />For the past 7 weeks I have applied, sometimes exactly, sometimes loosely, the EASY method. I have to say that the results have been wonderful. I am totally caught up on sleep, and have been since his birth. My husband seems happy, since he knows what comes next in the routine, and imagine my shock when HE can even read the baby's cues (he didn't read the book, by the way.) I will contrast this to my other 2 babies, when he would ALWAYS interpret their cries as needing to nurse. Best of all, our baby is doing wonderfully. He's nursing every 2 1/2 to 3 hours during the day (I'm not very strict on the time, but usually careful about the order of EASY.) At his one month check up he was WAY off the charts for weight, having gained 3 pounds, so no worry about thriving. At night, he's now sleeping a 5 to 6 hour block, then another 4-5 hours. Very nice. We have him in his own room, another plus being we actually get some couple time and I'm sleeping more soundly.<br />The only thing I don't like about this book was the feeling that I was messing up if I didn't stick to EASY exactly. But I can't really blame that on Tracy, since she does say to be flexible. I really think she could make that point more often, and maybe it would sink in better. <br />All in all, I would recommend to other mothers to try the EASY method, to be flexible and not be down on yourself when it doesn't work. For instance, for a couple of weeks, I followed the schedule until dinnertime, when he got fussy, then did whatever it took to keep him happy. Even following the EASY schedule some of the time will help!!<br />I also wanted to say that although Tracy does have some good advice, I believe that parents shouldn't look at her book as an all or nothing textbook on how to parent.  I think parenting books are more like cookbooks, where you read a few, taking the \\"recipes\\" that would work for your family.  Just because you don't like a few of her ideas doesn't mean the whole book is garbage.  I personally love bouncy seats and slings, and will rock my babies to sleep whenever I feel like it.  On the other hand, I will also let them cry a bit and don't carry them around all the time.  You could go crazy trying to find the perfect parenting book.  It doesn't exist.  You have to come up with your own plan for your own baby and your own parenting style, and at least in my case, I believe that style is subject to change whenever I feel like it.<br />One thing I was leary of was her idea of schedules.  I hate planning my day, usually letting things happen whenever.  I really thought I would hate having to plan my day around a baby.  Boy was I wrong.  I absolutely love it.  I also think my baby loves it.  He knows what comes next.  I know what comes next, and that gives me more freedom than I ever had before with an unstructured routine.  So if you hate the thought of being ruled by a clock (which is really far from the truth on the EASY plan) you should give this a try.<br />The fact that I have 30 minutes to get onlineand type this is testimony enough of the benefits of this book. :)  <br />Thanks Tracy for helping me enjoy my newborn!
B00006690G|4.0|This new album isn't another \\"Marshal Mathers LP.\\" I doubt there will ever be another CD as great as that one. What makes Eminem so great is his way with words...the Marshal Mathers LP proves that. This album solidifies it. Em keeps you entertained throughout the whole thing. He even gives singing a try on 'Hailie's Song'! And it's not that bad....surprise surprise lol. There's not that much mom and Kim bashing lyrics, which proves his verstiability. However, his rhymes does get repetitive at times. Like the typical \\"you\\" and \\"fool\\" rhyming methods.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|Basically, a re-hash, just a bit of script tweaking. Still, there are a few cute and clever spots. Frank, who arfs along to the car radio...the ever charming Smith and the stoic but always dependable Jones...and, NO surprise at all, Michael Jackson as an alien. It's not like we didn't see THAT comin', huh ?
B00006IR5S|4.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets is at whole, an amazing soundtrack, and i am pleased to inform you that they have fixed some gliches that haunted the first soundtrack; The continual need to play the theme in every single track. I am glad that they have widened the playing field of the music so that you have a variety of music.<br /> Unfortionately i feel strongly the same about this soundtrack as i have the rest of Williams' for the last few years. it seems like he's slipping, and despite Jurassic park and A.I. his scores all are beginging to sound the same, including his lack to create more music. his self playgerism in Hook over E.T. was rediculus, seeing as the themes almost matched in some spots, and now with harry potter, i am begining to the same formula of music that he's used over and over again. I havn't herd it, but i hear that Cath Me If you Can is amazing, offering a new sound, which is something that i as a williams fan have been waiting for.<br /> The music is amazing, and the newer themes reflect the older ones in a good way, leaving you satisfied, but it feels like the same material. We have herd williams do his best before in such film as Jurassic park and countless others, but i give it four stars, becuase lately, he could have done better...
0425170349|5.0|This is one of the best Clancy books. Do not pay attention to the 1-star reviews where the reviewer never even finished the book... they obviously don't know what they are talking about. Also, Clancy is writing about environmentalist extremists, not any certain ones that actually exist. The 1-star reviews seem to think that Clancy did not do his homework. His story is quite possible under the right circumstances. This book is a must-read. However, if you want action in every page, try a different book. In real life action does not happen every second. Expect an action scene every 200 pages. The action scene will last probably 20 pages, maybe a little more. But they are awesome! The final battle is a piece of cake, however....
B00005OAIE|3.0|Yes, it's light. Yes, he's young. ...Back to Mayer. Given that he's only 23 (and I'm over a decade older), I see that he is trying to express opinions and insights that most his age wish they could begin to articulate. Most of the time he succeeds. But what's most entertaining about this CD is the music. Having seen Mayer in concert recently, I was amazed that he not only writes all his lyrics, but plays many of the instruments you will hear on the CD.<br />It's good for a lazy, laid-back day when you don't want sugary-sweet, but aren't ready for something salty. He is a mellow choice well-executed. And as a Dave Matthews fan, I do see some similarity, but I don't discount him as a DM wannabe. John Mayer is on his way, buy this CD and begin to watch him grow.
079070546X|5.0|This movie is in my mind still overlooked as one of the great films of all time.  It is by far the best of the National Lampoon/Chevy Chase vaccation films.  <br />You owe it to yourself to watch &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; every holiday season!  <br />If you have not seen &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; buy it or rent it, but watch it and watch it again.  It gets better and better with each viewing.  Enjoy!
B00003CX9Q|4.0|The story basically remains the same, but it is still sweet, tender and also loving. Some moments which might prove frightening for young kids ( the line of govt men walking along the street, with ominous music ), but who hasn't wanted ET to stay or Elliot to go with ET and stay friends forever ? The music matches the emotional swells and comic moments intertwined with the drama make this highly watchable. Maybe it is a simple story, but it is a joyful story.
B000000H6D|5.0|This album is truly dark and yes witty at some points. What I like about this album is that Peter Steele uses all the Gothic sterotypes and makes them into humorous songs. But the song that really touched me on this album is Bloody Kisses, it is about a suicide of a girl, and I'll leave it at that...<br />But I just want to conclude that Type O Negative is not mocking the \\"Gothic\\" culture, but they mock the stereotypes that come with it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|ok ,the cd wasnt so great but if you are a fan , you really wont care if it doesnt sound like diva's sing the songs. its just a fun time and shouldnt be taken serious . you people are too uptight , it was only ment to poke fun . the episode was also a creative move on joss whedon's part ... lighten up guys...
B000001DTM|4.0|&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; are U2's great masterpieces. They have a perfect mix of ballads and upbeat songs. Also the variations in sounds on the Album are great. And the thing that puts the icing on the cake is the lyrics. They are just awesome, just like the album.

B00003CXCD|4.0|Lovely, sheltered and protected princess escapes the confines of her royal handlers and scurries off into the night, in search of real life. Fortunately, she meets an American, who certainly can show her about, but the undercurrent of possible betrayal and personal gain is always under the surface. Since this IS a fairy tale, essentially, it highlights the scenery of Roma and her adventures, while capturing the spirit of a sweeter<br />\\" la dolca vita. \\" Hepburn is at her most gamine best when she needs to be and at her most beautiful and regal when called on for that aspect. Peck is, as usual, strong and handsome and well matched agaisnt Hepburn. For comic relief, Eddie Albert at his 1950's-ish bohemian / photograher / artiste best. Eye candy for fans of the three and for The Eternal City.
B000069HKH|2.0|Before I get started, let me say that I am a huge Springsteen fan. I climbed on board the train in 1978 and have been a loyal fan ever since. Having said that, the Rising poses a problem for me. For starters, I only had the courage to listen to it four times since the release in July. That is unheard of in my circle. I guess the CD is too much of a kick in the gut because I was a mere 6 blocks from the towers on 9/11. Anyone who knows the area knows that is being in the long shadow of those buildings. My reluctance to embrace the Rising has to do with something I've suspected since the attack and the ensuing analysis. That is to say there are two types of people, those who were north of Canal Street and those who were south of Canal Street on 9/11. I don't discount the feelings of those who watched on television, or from the shore of New Jersey like Bruce. However a person's proximity to the attack, in my opinion, is directly related to art that has been created regarding 9/11. I applaud Bruce for his courage to write songs on such a difficult subject. He does offer some comfort to those of us dealing in the post-trauma world. My problem with Springsteen is the comfort he offers to our enemy on Paradise. In short, he wasn't there. He didn't see the massacre of the innocent or the smell of dust and death. If he did, he wouldn't write a piece garbage like Paradise. I also see hypocrisy in his politics. He clearly enjoys the money and fame one can only garner in a capitalist society. He has no problem charging his loyal fan base $75 for a ticket, and then lectures them about rolling back civil liberties in the name of terrorism is a bad thing. Forgive us Bruce if we are tired as a nation of sitting around waiting to be murdered. I for one am happy that our elected leadership, both democrats and republicans are hard at work trying to prevent another attack. Perhaps your vantage point of the attack from across the river is much like your vantage point of life from your mansion on the hill. You are so far removed from reality that you can no longer sing in a climate of relevance. Thanks for the ride; your music got me through my young adult life and right through to parenthood. During that time you sang of people like me just facing life as it happens. Now you are just another America hating liberal who offers comfort to suicide bombers. I'll step off the train now, good luck with your twisted ideology the rest of the way. If you think for a moment you would have had the same career in a socialist country you are sadly mistaken. America has been good to you and your family; it wouldn't kill you to show some appreciation.
B00001MXXH|5.0|Of all the Brat Pack teen movies that were all the rage in my youth, the one that stands the test of time the best is Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  While I still enjoy my Breakfast Club and my Pretty in Pink, it is more from a nostalgic aspect.  These movies just don't have the same substance to me as they once had when I was 15 years old.  If I once related to the shallow heart strings that these movies tugged at, I no longer do.  They feel... contrived.  Ferris, on the other hand, still manages to not only bring me back to my mispent youth, but also reminds me of what it truly was like being a teenager.  The exhuberance of a day skipping school and the pain of not being able to relate to your parents at all is all there.<br />Don't get me wrong... I still love all my brat pack movies, but I would never suggest someone born after 1980 to watch any of them except this one.  Ferris Bueller holds its own in any generation.  Besides, who can resist Ben Stein?
B00006RU5B|4.0|I'm not even going to bring up the inevitable, which is obviously comparing sounds to both the garden or rage...but rather forgetting both origins of either bands...in which I will give an unbiast review being a huge soundgarden fan.<BR>firstly it is a fresh new sound which is exactly what everyone has been asking for in this subdueing music genre.<BR>Cornell, being in my opinion having one of the most amazing vocals our time has ever witnessed, does an exceptionable job backing the rest of the attack from the guys of rage.<BR>although it is thier first album , which will unquestionably get better with time as these guys have flawless potential for making great music...I will say this, only negative is that it could of been much more heavier thought provoking tracks here.
B00005JL2O|3.0|Not the best of the series, by any means...although the cameos were terrifically funny and possibly worth the price of the DVD, as was watching Ms Spears' head explode. The flatulence jokes are wearing thin, as Frau was horribly underused in this one and, ok scream and yell...I was waiting for another Rob Lowe appearance as Young #2, in which he nailed Rober Wagner so well in the second AP. The Goldmember character was perhaps the worst in the series...I thought the special efx with the legs was pointless and a waste. The character didn't seem well developed or even evil enough...just disgusting. Foxxy was - well, foxy, in that Pam Grier kind of way. Fat Bastard seemed almost an afterthought as well. Enough with Mini Me already or else get him a mini Frau...
B00005YXZH|5.0|I kept seeing the title of this cd appear repeatedly on &quot;Best Of&quot; lists. I finally wanted to see what all of the hype was about and went out and bought it. And now I'm sorry that I didn't pick this up earlier - I could have been enjoying it all year. It's truly a brilliant album. I keep reading that most people have to listen to it repeatedly before they enjoy it. I've got to say that I loved it the first time I heard it. After the first time I listened to it, I wanted to go back for more - and ended up listening to it a few times. I haven't done that to a cd in a long time. Pick it up - you won't be sorry.
B00006LFGD|5.0|This cd is a nicely mastered completer set to the previously released &quot;Essential Streisand.&quot; Featured are songs that were hits but left off the previous compilation due to programming issues, the biggest one being lack of space.  <br /> To fill out the album and to give her fans some new material, Barbra performs two new songs and adds a vocal to a vintage medley taken from her &quot;Barbra Joan Streisand&quot; album, &quot;One Less Bell To Answer/A House Is Not A Home&quot; making the tune a duet so it'll fit with the theme. <br /> The Barry Manilow Barbra duet was a fantasy of Clive Davis' for years, now that he is no longer the head of Arista and Barry no longer an artist on their roster, the match is somewhat bittersweet but achieved, which is the important point. <br />  I am glad the vintage duets got the mastering they deserve and a good home. One of my personal favorites is the Kim Carnes duet &quot;Make No Mistake, He's Mine&quot; taken from Barbra's overlooked album &quot;Emotions.&quot;  There were hits on this album outside this duet, the title track complete with an awesome video and &quot;Left In The Dark,&quot; produced, arranged, and directed by power ballad Wagner inspired Jim Steinman, think Meatloaf.   <br /> A duet that's overplayed and &quot;overreleased&quot; is the Celine Dion duet &quot;Tell Him.&quot;  Once again, and hopefully for the last time, it's here.  I'm not alone when I say Kris Kristofferson can't sing. Not with Barbra, not with Rita Cooledge, no one.  He's a good songwriter and that's all. I dislike his acting, I dislike Barbra's version of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; and I feel her solo version of &quot;Lost Inside Of You&quot;  found on &quot;Memories&quot; is far superior, and so does she. Why else would she have recorded a solo version? This cd is an overview of all her duets, so this song for consistancy sake must be here. <br /> For pure camp value, Harold Arlen's &quot;Ding, Dong The Witch Is Dead&quot; is presented in classic 60's pop arrangement, Harold's voice can be best described as &quot;essentric.&quot;  You'll be dancing the &quot;swim&quot; to this one. Harold Arlen helped propel the career of Judy, Judy, Judy. Say what you will, the lady was a legend then as she is now and will be for all time. The duet here was a once in a lfetime meeting and thank God it was recorded, even if the track is mono. Judy had showbusiness logic and recognized Barbra's endless talant and of the great things to come. Speaking of talent, the young Josh Groban is talanted, yes, but what is he exactly? He's headed to Broadway, me thinks. The new Michael Crawford??
B00006CXXU|5.0|Of course, I don't expect this album to appeal to all people.  It seems that some people find Christina's voice irritating and they would prefer not to hear her speak or see her on television or in a periodical.  However, those who actually have negative feelings toward her need to listen to her new album, and listen with an open mind.  This is perhaps one of the most empowering, healing, and POSITIVE albums out there.  I was literally on a high of pure bliss for two days after I bought this album.  I never thought music could have that strong of an impact on me, but Christina did it.  Although there are two \\"raunchy\\" tracks on this album (\\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" and \\"Dirrty\\"), this doesn't mean that they don't fit with the album or corrupt it in any way.  She is simply helping to carry across the message that Madonna tried to convey:  \\"Don't be afraid of sexuality.\\"  Christina is telling her listeners that it's okay to be sexual (well \\"DUH\\" this isn't an album for kids...most kids wouldn't even understand the depth of most of the songs and that's FINE).  She is also encouraging us to all be true to ourselves and to never let anyone force us to be someone else.  For those of you who are afraid to buy this album because of Christina's tendency to avoid staying on a note, do not worry.  She definitely shows people that she can stay on a note all through this album, and she even holds a note in \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\" for several measures and with such a rich tone that I cried the first time I heard it.  She has refined her style much more and shows that her real musical soul does't lie in \\"pop-ish,\\" shallow, electronically-produced beats, but in hip-hop, blues, rock, gospel, Latin, and R&B music (and probably even more than that).  If you enjoy soulful singing of soul-lifting music, this is an album that you have to buy.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis picks up where the Beatles left off.  There is no mistaking their influences, except that the influences stop at that-- they are not a cover band.  Oasis' sound is very unique and familair.. 'Wonderwall' and 'Champagne Supernova' will have even your grandmother stomping her foot.
6305922756|1.0|This is truely the WORST movie I have ever seen.  It is about a bogus British band that's losing popularity (I wonder why).  It seems like they just made a movie to go around bad jokes (ex: \\"They foung the cover to your album offensive.\\"\\"What about it?\\"\\"The fact that you had a naked woman on all fours on a leash\\"  Ha, ha, ha.  Then he hides a cucumber down his pants to <BR>try to make people think he has a huge penis.  Ha, ha, ha. BOOOORING!!! Don't waist you time on the movie!!
B00003CXXM|4.0|This movie was very good but didn't have the characters in the book. One of the main characters Carlos wasn't in the movie. But the action was very good. I love the part where Jason grabs that guy and uses him as a cousion for the fall. All in all this is a must see movie.
B000067DNC|5.0|VERY good season, can't wait for Season 3 to become available. The actors are GREAT & the storylines are never ending!!! It REALLY fires the imagination!!
B000002UB3|5.0|Five stars are what I would give a great album.  Abbey Road deserves at least six.  From the swirling bubbles of &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; to the swirling organ of &quot;I Want You&quot; -- from the gentle beginnings of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; to the three guitarists exchanging leads on &quot;The End&quot;, this is the finest Pop/Rock album ever.  Paul never played bass better or sang better, George never wrote better songs, and John was in peak form.
B00005YUNY|4.0|... 'Yes - Symphonic Live'. When I read this was a tour of YES and Orchestra I was pleased, especially seeing the track list. Close to the Edge, Gates of Delerium and Ritual are the long form tracks. All three sound outstanding with good orchestration arrangements. Of the three Close to the Edge impresses the most. Parts of Gates... just seem limp. Far from bad but at times uninspired in particular Steve Howe.<br />I'm not sure what it is but he seems to have become fixated with clean guitar tones. The problem is some of his best and most fluid work are based on mildly to highly saturated distortion. Even his pedal steel has more grit than many of his other traditional guitar parts. Also, his stage presence while non-existant wasn't a problem, it just seemed like he was keeping an eye on everyone else. His solo pieces are pleasant although it seemed weird that all players other than the keyboardist get chances to be featured. <br />Obviously he plays a diminished role between the orchestra and the main YESmen but at times you wish he was more involved. On Close to the Edge he aquits himself nicely, getting most of Wakeman's parts down, sometimes cleaner.<br />In the 'wish this had been recorded' mode I could have done without another version of And You And I, Owner of a Lonely Heart and a few frequently recorded live tracks. On the other hand it is great fun to watch some of the orchestra dance around on Roundabout. There are muscular versions of Starship Trouper, Magnification and the long form songs.<br />What is somewhat sad are the band's performances, in particular Steve Howe who has traded in the fire in his playing for precision. This is a shame as I love this guitarist's work. Also, Chris Squire is often so busy prancing around the stage that he doesn't pay attention to some less than spectacular lapses.<br />The showmanship on this DVD comes from Alan White who seems to be the quarterback of the YES/Orchestra synergy. Jon Anderson seems to be having a greattime and it radiates from the stage. <br />The keyboard player is overdramatic, as if studying 70's prog rocker keyboardists and trying to emulate their theatrics. He doesn't have the look and seems too reserved for the faux high energy performance.<br />Also, what was the director thinking with the cheesy special effects that crop up (thankfully) only a few times? But the icon for animations seems to show up no matter if you check the 'turn off icon' selection. <br />Beyond this the picture is excellent with reasonable tight shots on soloists although there are still plenty of scenes of Jon Anderson playing gong while the rest of the band or orchestra go nuts. Still, the camera placements and editing are good and Dreamtime on disc 2 is revealing and worth watching.<br />After viewing the documentary on the 2nd disc it is obvious that Howe is something of a control freak and does not play well with other guitarists, a shame as I like his playing and had hoped his personality would be as dynamic as his playing.<br />For all the critical remarks I've made I can only dock Yes - Symphonic Live one star. The concert as a whole is very exciting and the playing is very good to exceptional.<br />YES at it's worst is of better quality than most rock acts in existance. Watching them play is a great experience although the contrast of middle aged men rocking out with an orchestra of young, attractive people is a visually stark contrast.<br />Even as a music DVD it's a great concert. The visuals are worthwhile and even the animations are pleasant although they can be turned off.<br />Most importantly this DVD should appeal to old fans who will find a few newer tracks from the Magnification album which blend well with the classics.
B00005OB0A|4.0|Kylie Minogue offers a nice Pop- and Dancealbum (?). She has got a nice voice but nothing special.<BR>More more more: A dance track. It won't keep you in your seats.<BR>Love at first sight: It's not a remake of the song on her first album. I like this nice Popsong.<BR>Can't get you out of my head: I really don't know what's so special about this song. The \\"la la la\\" chorus goes on my nerves.<BR>Fever: Not the same song that Madonna sings. An ordinary popsong. <BR>Give it to me: Kylie tries to sound a little bit like a rocksinger.<BR>Fragile: A dreamy dancesong.<BR>Come into my world: Another typical Kylie-Dancesong. I really like it.<BR>In your eyes. A sexy popsong. It's so-so.<BR>Dancefloor: Another nice song. The title says it.<BR>Love affair: This discosong is by far the best on the whole album. Melody, lyrics and her voice... just irresistible.<BR>Your love. Nice summersong.<BR>Burning up: Another discosong. Not a Madonna-cover.<BR>Boy: Kylie tries R n'B. But the song doesn't really have a highlight.<br />Butterfly: The sound overwhealms her voice  (?) in this one.  It was on the touredition of her \\"Light years\\"-album. <br />PS: English is hard believe me:-)
6304071906|5.0|True this movie was very long and the plot progressed slowly at times but, this was not made to be a cling to your seat adventure. The story is quite well crafted although some might find the subplots a bit vexing if they have a short attention span. Unfortunately Heaven's Gate was released in the heyday of fast moving shallow plotted movies. Had it been set in outer space or the distant future critics would have marveled at the attention to detail rather than panned the complexity.<br />The idea that this is a dangerous place to be poor does not set easy with many. We like to think of the 1880s as a &quot;good&quot; time and find it hard to accept something as bad as the Johnson Cattle Wars Could have happened. Admittedly I do not know enough about the event to say how accurate the account is. The story is an old one though, The rich and powerful must be protected from the poor and weak. The movies ending I would say was very accurate for such situations.<br />Would I recommend the movie? That depends. If you think \\"Friends\\" and \\"Survivor\\" are great entertainment and need instant gratification I have to say no. If you enjoyed \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" or \\"The Seven Samurai\\" I would advise it. Just arrange to have plenty of time and minimal distractions because you will have to pay attention to get the most out of it.
0316666343|3.0|This was a terrific book from the standpoint of having a grabbing premise, interesting Point of View, and loved the overall themes. Really a more innovative approach than I had anticipated.<br />But I felt the characters, aside from Susie, were as stereotypical as they come in the case of a grieving family. This caused me some difficulty in 'sticking with' the story, because near the end, it was as if it dawned on the author that she had to come up with an ending...so when her tone shifts...you don't really have enough of an attachment to the characters and it just ends kind of strangely, given the strong start.<br />I would recommend this, but marginally. It's a good read, but does have it's disappointing spots.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I do not watch war movies. Ever. But I watched Band of Brothers and it is one of my favorite movies (series) of all time. There is much action in war, wounded, dying. But when I watched it, the story stood up to it's name. Band of Brothers. They went through hell, but they did it as brothers. Supporting each other, laughing, crying, fighting and dying. <BR>I've never understood how anyone could find the courage to face missles, bullets, bombs, and loss of so many friends. Band of Brothers shows me how. One minute at a time. <BR>This series should also help people grasp what so many have done to keep our country \\"free\\". Although I'm not sure if they saw us to do if they would feel it was worth it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina does not get enough credit for this album because everyone is so focused on how she was dressed in her Dirrty video but this album in very sincere and honest and has a lot of heart to it.  The songs on this album most people can relate to and can sing along to.  <br />Song ratings out of 10<br />Can't Hold Us Down- her deut with lil' kim was good but i especially liked the message in this song. 7/10<br />Walk Away- a nice song to sing to. 7/10<br />Fighter- loved it. 10/10<br />infatuation- easy to dance to but the most influencial. 8/10<br />Loving me 4 me- very good ballad, could of used more of her   talent. 8/10<br />Impossible- great duet with Alicia Keys. 9/10<br />underappreciated- good R&amp;B song but not the most attractive. 7/10<br />Beautiful- love it, very influencial. 10/10<br />Make Over- nice tale of true stories. 8/10<br />Cruz- One of my favorites. 10/10<br />Soar- Great church theme. 8/10<br />Get mine/ Get yours- not as good as it could've been. 6/20<br />Dirrty- great song to dance to. 8/10<br />The voice within- her talent soars, love it. 10/10<br />I'm ok- Made me want to cry, love it. 10/10<br />Keep on singin my song- nice flow good lyrics. 8/10<br />Christina Aguilera is the next whitney houston but much BETTER
B00005QG9J|5.0|first off mat is completely wrong, and why would you compare incubus to 311 anyway?! and if your such a big fan, why do you call brandon BRIAN?!anyway, this cd has it all in my opinion. funk tunes, are you in?! have you ever, besides incubus hasnt been funk since fungus amongus and enjoy incubus if anything this is more funk then make yourself, make yourself had the same bass beats on everysong. Well anyway from start to finish this album just locks you in. catchy guitar riffs (nice to know you,blood on the ground, circles) crazy drum beats and excellen bass in are you in? there isnt much more to ask of this album. but i do suggest one thing, you must listen to this album more then once, if you dont you wont get what im telling here, the more you listen the better it is.This album is different, and some godsmack, rob zombie, korn fans might get this and scream that its a change,but that shows talent, yes incubus isnt the hardest band but they are one of the best
B00005JL78|3.0|I will admit to not viewing this willingly:  My best friend is a rabid Tom Cruise fan, and insisted we rent it.  It wasn't bad, but could have used some changes or 'tweaking' to make it more interesting.<br />The use of technical elements was actually pretty cool.  I can actually envision some/most of these gadgets being in use in the not-so-distant future, and it was just cool to see a high tech movie not weighted down by the technese.  The personalized ads were also pretty cool as a plot device.  I did find the eyeball switching to be a bit contrived and a stretch to believe...but it didn't detract from the overall premise too much for me.<br />I do think that, had Spielberg's name not been attached to it, it probably would have registered a little lower on the overall critical scale.  One major problem with this movie is it could have benefitted largely from more editing:  you can lose 20 - 30 minutes of this movie and it would have flowed so much better!!!!<BR>It got very draggy at certain points and, under a less-respected director/production team, critics would have made note of this.<br />This is a good movie, but bring your attention span.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Mechanical Animals is a display of surrealism and you need to empathise with the hole declining-depresion drug addict thing to get the message of the lyrics. Manson is talking about being used for your money and fame but when things go wrong people just don't wanna know. This album isn't just a load of abusive yelling and swearing, it's almost inviting you to step inside the shoes of someone's life that isn't all pretty flowers and easy sailing.Some of the Tracks that grasped me in the first instance where (2: The Dope Show and (6: The Speed of Pain. This album isn't Manson at his best, not by far, but this is for the people that are picked on and are suffering from depression, as Manson talks about being yourself and not [caring] about what other people think. Highly recommended for you sceptics, but if you want hardcore-rock then Holy Wood or AntiChrist Superstar would be more appropriate.k Is Dead&quot; is amazing, &quot;Coma White&quot; is a  great change of pace from the harder Antichrist which shows that Manson  knows how to make slower music too, and my personal favorite, &quot;New  Model No. 15&quot;, is very well done.<br />My advice? Well there's no doubt  that many fans of the Antichrist Superstar Manson will be let down by this  drastic change, but as for me, I'm fine with it. I'm happy that Manson  didn't rehash and re-release The Beautiful People and make another  Antichrist Superstar. Mechanical Animals is awesome, and it'll tide me over  until his next album.
0066214122|4.0|Crichton did a very good job in drawing drama out of science.  Some readers may have a problem with the depth of characters other than Jack Forman, but for me and most other geeks and nerds, the plot plus accurate science is the priority.  I've been reading about genetic algorithms, complex adaptive systems, predator-prey processes and emergence phenomena for years and this book brings those ideas together in a great science fiction suspense-horror story, complete with monsters, slime and grotesque dead bodies.<br />I see a problem with the death scene of the infected characters.  Given that the E. coli simply give feedstock molecules to manufacture of future nanostructures, if all the E. coli in a swarm die, the swarm wouldn't die instantly.  So, the people infected with virus wouldn't die immediately.  This is about the only glaring mistake that I could find, given my limited knowledge.  However, I may be missing some other clue.
B000067DNC|5.0|Loved it!  I love owning the episodes to this series.  It is an excellent science fiction show that is as entertaining as any yet produced, maybe more!<br />The only thing that really [makes me mad] is how slowly each season is being released on DVD in the US.  Seasons 1-5 (1 and 2 in boxed sets, and 3 being released 1-27-03) are already available in Europe!  Seasons 4 and 5 are available via 5-6 CD's, each containing 3-4 episodes...  Well, it stems from the fact that every cable channel on the planet (practically) is trying to make advertising dollars off of re-running the episodes.  They're not even smart enough to run them in order for God's sake.<br />I'm almost tempted to spring for a Region 2 DVD player so I can by and play these European package DVD's.  The projected release to seaseon 5 in the US takes place over the next three years!!!  ... only know's when season 6 will be out...<br />...
B00005YW4H|5.0|I don't know where she came from, but FINALLY, a new female artist with some 1.) actual talent, 2.) some originality, and 3.) a perfect blend of musical styles that compliment instead of overwhelm.<br />Listen to the samples if you haven't had the good fortune to hear this CD yet. As good as those bits are, the rest of the album is just as fresh, crisp, and new. <br />Jones has a voice that is difficult to pin down, but one of the easiest to listen to. It's amazing to think she's packed so much world-weary insight into a voice in her eary 20's, but she sings with a tone that makes you identify with many of the emotions Come Away With Me expresses.<br />Her multiple grammy nods were well deserved, and you cannot go wrong with this CD. Period.
B00005U2JL|4.0|I got this Video for Xmas and i must say was highly dissapointed.<BR>During all of the songs the footage skips back and forth from place to place, leaving you somewhat confused. Manson, however does have a terrific live voice, and carries out his reputation brilliantly... Though it is a laugh, so i would recommend.
6304806426|5.0|The film is truly epic.  One to own on archival medium. <br /> This film requires a particular kind of viewer, and I can see where some stray negative criticism could slip in.  Long film.  Limited action.  Few special effects.  And little feeding.  For people who need to be \\"fed\\" by their movies, look elsewhere.  This film requires you to become involved, and to be emotionally susceptible.  Once you give yourself to the film, you are grasped by the power of the story and the mastery of the talent which brought this film to being.  You will be intimately absorbed.  <br /> Hats off to the entire staff of this film.  The casting was superb, and I cannot think of better actors (past or present) to perform the roles of this film.  Fiennes' character is initially a tough nut to crack, from viewer's vantage.  He evolves from a magnetic, enigmatic soul to a love-driven obsessor, all the while maintaining a well-cultured and educated stature.  No sugar-coating on this character, nor should there be.  A particularly difficult character to portray, I should think.  Thomas' character: lovely, vulnerable, temptable, and very well acted.  Binoche's character was very true and immediately sympathetic, giving viewers automatic compassion.  Andrews (Kip) was immediately likable; perhaps slightly underplayed, but no hint anywhere of flaw that would diminish the role whatsoever.  Dafoe, powerful as usual.  Each of the remainder of the actors are to be applauded as well. <br />  Marvelous cinematography; wonderful scenery.  Fabulous script.  Not your typical adventure film, not your typical love story.  Refreshingly unique.  This film was heavily awarded, and rightly so.
B00005U11Z|5.0|For all Journey fans! Their music has never sounded better.  Highlights for me were La Raza del Sol and Fillmore Boogie...both showcase all of the band members' talents which have only gotten better with time.  Drummer Deen Castronovo is a monster on drums! Steve Augeri does the old Journey tunes justice and has his own style, very charismatic!
0140042520|5.0|This is the first Kerouac book I've read and it is a wonderful book to experience.  The story is interesting, the ideas are important, and the prose is explosive.<br />The two main subjects dealt with in the book seem to be:<BR>1) the illusion of the world of appearances<BR>2) the meaninglessness of the world<br />These topics are considered over and over (among some others) and looked at from different emotional perspectives.   The ideas at times make the characters depressed, and at other times, they're at peace with these ideas.  I think it is this type of examination, of the different stances towards &quot;the void,&quot; which is the real topic of the book--and this is as important a topic as there is.<br />Also, I worried about an abrupt ending to the book as I read it, but found the last paragraph to be my favorite of all.  I highly recommend the book.
0316666343|4.0|I am always reading Stephen King, James Patterson, and Patricia Cornwell.  I enjoyed this book because, while it still included some dark subject matter (in this case, rape and murder), it was a hopeful book.  I enjoyed the refreshing perspective, and I think that the writing itself was wonderfully descriptive.  I would highly recommend this one if you feel like you've been reading the same sort of novel again and again.
B00003CX95|4.0|After watching Braveheart on DVD,I decided that I was a huge fan of Mel Gibson.The DVD is so incredible that It got my attention when i was watching it.
B00000099Y|5.0|I am only 16 years old, but (as much as I don't like to be arrogant) I do believe I'm one of the most musically inclined people at my school.  Having been a fan of classical music for much of my life, I never thought to give Tool a chance, but after a very gradual dive into some rock- emo, indie, and even some heavy metal- I saw an article in Spin magazine about the best rock albums of all time.  I saw Tool, Aenima, as number 5, so, immediately, I was interested, as I respect the opinions of professionals, not to mention the fact that some of my musically inclined friends were fans in the first place.  So, Aenima went down on my christmas list, and I humbly accepted it from my aunt Jane.  Ever since this album first was read by my cd player, I have been completely addicted.  I went out and bought Lateralus as quickly as possible, and I can't stop listening to either.  I can tell you right now, from a musician's standpoint, that Tool is one of the best bands I have come into contact in my entire life, and I would daresay that there are none better.  Warping from time signature to time signature, key to key, while keeping an insanely articulate rhythm and the most musical chemistry I've ever seen between band members, this is absolutely the most impressive album I have ever heard.  PLEASE ignore my young age, get the idea out of your head that I'm musically immature, and believe me when I tell you that it is VERY hard to impress me like this album has.  You MUST buy this album.
B00005OC0G|2.0|Ms. Mutter comes alive in the later movements, but by then the listener may have lost interest.  The first movements are flat, almost dull, and devoid of the passion this piece demands and deserves.  If you listen to the whole recording you will understand why Ms. Mutter has so many fans, but few listeners will get that far.
0316666343|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read, and I am almost certain will be taught in high schools within the next 20 years.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This has to be the best album of anyone I have listened to. Not at all like the pap put out by Spears, Aguliera or Kylie. If you haven't heard this CD you are missing something special.
B000060OFT|5.0|This is an incredible movie!! Everything about it - from the setting to the actors to the music is amazing. This movie is set in modern times but the dialogue is not, so i suggest that you have some sort of knowledge concerning that sort of speech to fully get the play and some of the jokes. Claire and Leo are great as Romeo and Juliet. The music is also great! i suggest this movie to anyone that is looking for a good movie and also a good cry (cause you will)
0786246448|5.0|If you no longer are able to make a moral choice for yourself then you stop being human.  To be saved, change must come from within, it can't be forced upon you.  You have to grow up on your own.  If you lose your free will, then you are no longer human and thus can not love or dream.  You become in a way a living mechanical thing, or, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\".<br />Anthony Burgess' novel is wonderful, and touches upon several issues with the criminal justice system which still exist today.  Should prisons be used to punish, or to reform?  If they are used to punish then does the prisoner become a victim?  What about the victims?  Should they be allowed to have their revenge?  Also, what can be done about overcrowding?<br />The book was also full of lots of irony.  In having the main character facing many of his old victims in the later chapters, I thought it seemed very much like a Frank Capra type of movie.  However, instead of seeing how much worse life would have been like for all his friends and family if he had not been born, (like it was in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"), you get to see how badly the main character had affected all of his victims by coming into their lives.<br />This particular novel contains a controversial last chapter which differs from the version which Stanley Kubrick used to base his movie upon.  It seems that the last chapter was originally cut out of the United States version of the novel, and only the British novels had the last one.  Now it has been added back in.  I can't picture the movie having been any better by having added this extra chapter back into it, but it was good to read the novel the way the author had intended, and it works well in the book form.<br />After seeing the movie I was surprised to see how short the novel was (less than two hundred pages), but it was packed with excitement.  One of the best books I ever read.

0151008116|4.0|I really liked this book, but I am afraid that it didn't change any of my views on faith or religion and for the bulk of the book reigion seemed to have very little to do with it. Of course you could come to some conclusion that Pi was spared from both the tiger and the ocean by God, but I think this is a weak assertion at best. Once the survival situation begins Pi survives by his own wits and knowledge, religion appears to have little or nothing to do with it. His pratical knowledge of animal behaviour and also his ability to overcome his religious aversion to eating meat are the keys to his survival. I did enjoy this book immensely though as it reminded me of a modern day Rudyard Kipling story.
B00005ATQD|5.0|In the end, Kubrick's last film displays the most positive view of the human condition ever seen in one of his films.  This is in sharp contrast to most of his other work, where Kubrick consistently portrayed the less attractive aspects of human nature.  Eyes Wide Shut, on the other hand, is exhilarating in its final affirmation of the value of trust and love.  Listen to Alice's closing monologue, which basically sums up what this viewer suspects what Kubrick was trying to say about living a meaningfully adult life.<br />Visually, the film is stunning, and SO characteristiclly Kubrick; fans will delight in the precise composition of scenes, the tracking shots, the use of saturated primary colors, the use of light and shadow.  <br />My only quibble with this DVD edition is that it is presented in a full-screen format.  The statement on the package suggests that the director intended the film to be presented in what is described as &quot;the original aspect ratio of the film negative,&quot; or something very close, whatever that means - but I have a tough time swallowing that when the film was presented in wide-screen in theaters.  Knowing Kubrick was meticulous about the elements presented in every single frame, I can't help but think we're missing something in this edition.  But this shouldn't deter you from contemplating this profoundly moving film.
0316666343|4.0|Susie Salmon is ripped from her family by violence at the age of fourteen. The story is told from her point of view looking down on the world from heaven. After putting herself back together she watches as her family grieves, the man who killed her goes on with life and watches her sister and brother grow up. The first two thirds of this book kept my attention as we watch her family pick up the pieces and move on with life. Her father is<BR>consumed with the need to find the man who killed his daughter and bring justice to Susie. Her mother is an unlikeable character as she compromises the investigation by becoming friendly with the lead detective and then leaving home. Her brother copes best<BR>by just pretending Susie was never here and leads a good life. Her sister is where the focus shifts and became the downfall of this book. If Sebold would of not aged the characters so many years and had a more realistic ending this book would of been a 10.
0385508417|4.0|Someday we may see families curled up on couchs on Christmas Eve, the television for once turned off. Rather than watching It's A Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street, they'll each have a copy of Skipping Christmas in their hands.<br />It took me a while to warm to this novel, but when I did, it was inescapably ensearing, and quite humourous. (It's rare for me to laugh out loud while reading a novel, but I certainly did with this one!) The story takes us into the lives of Luther and Nora Krank who have decided, for one year and one year only, they're going to skip Christmas all together. They've just sent their daughter away for a year with the Peace Corps, no family's around, and they'd frankly rather take a cruise than worry about buying gifts and decorating the house. In the end, they find skipping Christmas isn't as easy as they had envisioned.<br />As I said, it took me a while to warm to this story. The first half of the novel didn't really click with me. I got the feeling Grisham was just going through the motions, writing a weak satirization of Christmas commercialism, but it turns out he was just setting the stage for the rest of the story. So, while I understand this was part of the story as well, I can't give the story a full five because I felt he did fall into an uncustomary lull at the beginning. Still, this is a very worthy Grisham novel, and one that should brighten everyone's holiday spirits.<br />Recommended for everyone, especially if you like light-hearted Christmas fare.<br />Matty J
B00004R997|4.0|While most of the reviews have been critical of this 1943 &quot;package feature&quot;, it is really cute and informational. It is a Disney classic, featuring the animation of many classic artists and animators, such as Mary Blair, Fred Moore, Norm Ferguson, Les Clark, Milt Kahl, Ward Kimball and others. It is the first feature which combines live action with animation, and would pave the way for other features to come, such as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;, and many others. <br />&quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; is comprised of 4 shorts, &quot;Lake Titicaca&quot;, &quot;Pedro&quot;, &quot;El Gaucho Goofy&quot;, and &quot;Aquarela De Brasil&quot;. Many classic Disney characters are included, including the slapstick Goofy and Donald Duck. New characters are introduced, which include Jose Carioca, the samba dancing friend of Donald. <br />There is also an array of bonus features, including an original theatrical trailer from 1943, and a documentary on the making of the film, which displays many of the films' crew members at work. <br />Overall, I think this is a very charming feature film.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I don't know what else to say.Christina has outdone herself with \\"Stripped\\".She has taken the time to create a meaningful,personal,and top quality album.What I mean by top quality, is powerful,emotive singing,excellent,melodically rich songs,and deep,affecting messages.Nothing is ever redundant,repetitive, or just \\"thrown together\\".You can tell there was a whole load of effort put into this disc.Nothing is \\"sticky\\" or overproduced.This is easily the year's best disc, and honestly one of the best cd's I've ever heard in my life.There is also a lot of variety, and I like that.Here's a quick review of each song-<br />1.Stripped pt.1-Most intro's make you wonder \\"why is this here\\".But this has a really nice tune, and is an all-around great introduction to the cd-8/10<br />2.Can't Hold Us Down-Great song.Fabulous beat that just makes you want to dance, and good lyrics about male/female stereotypes.Features a guest rap by Lil' Kim, which could've been a bit better.-9/10<br />3.Walk Away-Amazing song.Rich,bluesy ballad which demonstrates Christina's stunning voice, and full vocal capacity.-10/10<br />4.Fighter-Fierce,hard-driving song, with a strong rock presence.You can feel the rage in Christina's voice as she sings.-10/10<br />5.Primer Amor Interlude-Christina speaking in Spanish, against a soft, guitar accompaniement.I don't understand what she's saying, but it still sounds romantic and pretty.-8/10<br />6.Infatuation-An excellent track with a hot Latin beat.Christina's warm,juicy voice accentuates this song perfectly. A perfect-10/10<br />7.Love's Embrace Interlude-This very brief interlude begins with sounds of a waterfall, and birds chiriping, and ends with Christina saying,\\"so afraid,afraid of love's embrace\\".It basically flows into the next song-8/10<br />8.Loving Me 4 Me-Smooth,smooth neo-soul-ly jam with airy vocals from Christina-9/10<br />9.Impossible-Another wonderful track.Alicia Keys provides piano accompaniment, besides having written and produced this song.This sounds a bit like something Alicia would sing, but it's a lot more dynamic than something Alicia would do.Great, soulful vocals from Christina-9.5/10<br />10.Underappreciated-A funky track.Groovy beat, and soulful chorus.-8/10<br />11.Beautiful-Beautiful describes itself perfectly.An uplifting, and beautiful song with a simplisticly touching message.She sings this song with so much meaning-10/10<br />12.Make Over-Probably the most experimental song on the disc.Reminds me of some old 70's funk rock.Very energetic.Empowering lyrics-9.5/10<br />13.Cruz-A dreamy song that reminds me of taking a long drive.A simple, pretty song-8/10<br />14.Soar-A gospel-tinged song with a good message-8.5/10<br />15.Get Mine,Get Yours-An upbeat song great for dancing, but also nice to listen to.A very sexy song-10/10<br />16.Dirrty-Great dance song.Hard.thumpin' beat,and funky,funky,funky!-10/10<br />17.Stripped pt.2-Basically a continuation of stripped, except it's saying different things.It's put in the perfect place, because the following ending songs are the deepest, and most personal on the disc, and this is kind of like an introduction to them.<br />18.The Voice Within-Beautiful old school ballad.One complaint:In a few spots,I noticed Christina lost her musicality, and just sang at the top of her lungs.So, for that, it gets a few points off.-8/10<br />19.I'm Ok-This song just leaves you inside out.In this songyou hear all about Christina's violent father, and how he tormented her throughout her childhood years.Her voice really takes on the role of this song, and it's as though she is telling the story.Beautiful melody.-A perfect 10/10<br />20.Keeep On Singing My Song-The perfect way to end the album.Another gospel-tinged track.Amazing vocal performance from Christina.10/10<br />This album is truly the definition of great music.If you're worried about buying this because you didn't enjoy Christina's previous works, or because these days it is so hard to find a decent album,then don't worry, because this album showcases a powerful singer,who adds emotion to every single word she says on \\"Stripped\\".I highly reccomend it.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This film is phenomenal.  The first time I watched it I was very confused but once I figured it out I realized how innovative it really is.  This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in quite some time.<br />When watching this film, one needs to approach with an open mind.  Many closed-minded people will watch once, say it's garbage because they didn't understand it, and never think twice to see what it's really about.<br />You don't have to try and be artsy or sophisticated to enjoy this film you just need to think.  If you don't particularly enjoy movies that make you think, this isn't for you!  But for those that like a film that challenges you, this is a must-see.
B000069CWE|5.0|Hi fellow LP fans! This CD is definitely worth checking out. I first bought CD and was disappointed. I thought I had just wasted my money. But, I listened to it for a week and the songs sounded a lot better. A month later, it was among one of my favorite CDs. This is one of those CDs that challenges you to like it. The remixes on Reanimation are not disappointing at all. The electronica, hip-hop/rap, added lyrics are really [good]. Reanimation is a great supplement to Hybrid Theory. Plus you get the Pts. of. Athrty music video. That was probably the greatest music video I have ever seen. This is really good CD!
6304884419|4.0|In his directorial debut, Robert DeNiro wisely took the kind of film he is known for as an actor: The gangster film. But A Bronx Tale is much more then just another gangster piece, and it succeeds mostly in its veering away from the usual fare.<br />DeNiro plays a father trying to make an honest living in the Bronx during the 1960's. But when his son \\"C\\" finds himself allured by the Mafia \\"godfather,\\" Sonny (Chez Pallimetri), doing business out of a neighboring bar, DeNiro tries to steer his son clear of danger. Soon, however, \\"C\\" is looking up to Sonny as a second father, and DeNiro feels threatened. <br />Rather then focusing on the crime, it emphasizes the family drama, drawing comparisons between the crime family and blood ties. And fortunately, for the most part, A Bronx Tale avoids common clichés and hokey outcomes that dramas concerning family often hit. Instead, it creates an involving situation where no one is portrayed as pure evil.<br />The film is not without its problems, however. At times the film suffers from over explanation, mostly through the use of narration by an older \\"C.\\" He repeatedly states the moral of the tale at the end of the film, when one doesn't need to be stated at all. It's something viewers should decide for themselves, with at most, a hint by the narrator. Also, the film could have used more scenes with just \\"C\\" and his father, as well as with Sonny, to better crystallize their relationships. While what's in the film is enough to get a good idea, it doesn't fully explore the tension and characterization. The film could benefit from an additional twenty minutes or so to fully flesh out everything.<br />But overall, A Bronx Tale provides a satisfying, and often times nostalgic look into family ties in 1960's New York. It's well worth the price to own.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Julia and Lena, two girls from Moscow, Russia, thrashed the charts with their mouth droppin single, all the things she said. Their new album,200 Km/h in the Wrong Lane, is one of the best I have heard in a long time. Their outright, in your face, bold show of lesbian love is just captivating. I've been obsessed with the song from the moment I heard it. It's almost scary how fast it has blown up, and so much support, I've never seen anything like it. Most bands have a fan club for a while and then they fade, but t.A.T.u. has a loving community of fans and so much support. Why not? The two sexy chicks from Russia have a lot of fans from gays and lesbians, and bisexuals. Everything they do is just eye-opening. If you want to know more, visit the website, ... and find out for yourself!
B00005ATQD|1.0|I had the unfortunate displeasure of seeing this horrible movie thanks to the recommendation by the video store clerk.  Boy did I learn my lesson.<br />All I can say is \\"Thank goodness this Kubrick jerk isn't around to make anymore movies.\\"<br />That said, I tried to think of something positive to say about this movie.  There is nothing...  The story?  Woman tells husband of her thoguhts of being with another man.  Man finds house with orgy going on. Man hangs around and watches til kicked out.  That's it.  Oh, and nothing but naked females, because, obviously when people have sex, only the women are naked.  There is nothing but full frontal female nudity in this movie.  It's obvious exploitation.  To make it even better, we get shots of several fully naked women with masks on.  Oh yes, to all men out there who thought this movie was great, that isn't exploitation at all.  Go explain THAT one to your mom.<br />How this movie got by on an R rating, I'll never know.  It should have received an X rating, but at the very least, NC-17.  It's sad that children of all ages can freely rent this movie.

B00005JKZT|5.0|I saw this movie twice already. I LOVED it. I have the soundtrack. That's good too. All of this movie is great! But go see the fist one first. So you can understand this movie better. Then read the book. This is the best movie I've ever seen because of 7 reasons:<br />1. best director: Peter Jackson<BR>2. best costumes<BR>3. best acting<BR>4. best picture<BR>5. best song: \\"Gollum's Song\\"<BR>6. best creatures<BR>7. best battle scenes<br />Every thing is great! See ya. Got to go see it again. Bye!<br />Rated: PG-13 for Epic Battle Sequences and Some Scay Images.<br />Running Time: 210 Minutes. (Counting Commercials and Credits)
0064471837|5.0|This book is wonderful. It is capturing...a true page turner. If you buy this one you will be caught in the series, so be prepared to buy Lireal (probably spelled wrong), and Abhorson (probably spelled wrong too). The book is creative and interesting, unlike some books in which the writers become too interested in the details and forget to create a capturing storyline. Descriptions are good, but stay simple, telling you just enough to give you a visual, and the storyline is very exciting. I think that any fantasy reader will enjoy this book.
0553573403|5.0|Each chapter of this book alternates the point of view it is told in from a group of about seven characters. At the begining of it all the characters but one are in the same location and the plot is developed and the characters are introduced in that way. The first two hundred pages are slow and boring and this book dosn't speed up much until the end. It also feels a bit disjointed.<br />I know I have made this book sound bad, but it is really just the begining to an awsome bunch of plots and character. And I haven't talked about the things that I liked about this book. Many of the people are heart warming. And they have difficult relationships with one another. They show what it is like in real life for people trying to work out their problems. The stories in this book are good also, but I can't think of how to describe them so I won't.<br />There are two really important things in this book that I didn't like. The first is that the religions in this book have strong spiritual forces in them that in the books that follow you will become very intimate with. I found that the spitual forces were freakish and evil.<br />The second thing I found extreamly oppjectionable is the sex in this book. It is very visual and grotesk. In the first few chapters you will think I am wrong but it increases substancially after awhile.

B000069HK2|2.0|Alright, well it isn't ALL that bad. There are a couple songs that are really good like \\"Poetic Tragedy\\" and \\"Taste Of INk\\", but the others really didn't meet up to my expectations. If I didn't have a cd burner, I WOULDN'T waste 16 bucks on this cd.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Reign of Fire starts off well, with a scene that pays nice homage to another british apocalyptic thriller, Quatermass and the Pit.  Then it stumbles, glossing over the end of the world and getting to humankind's Last Stand.  Rob Bowman creates some nice X-Files style atmosphere and some rousing action scenes, but there is precious little story to hold it all together.  Not that one watches movies like this for the story, we want dragons blowing fire and humans kicking dragon tail.  On that level the movie delivers the goods.  Matthew McConaughey makes for a nice pseudo-Quint dragonslayer, but Christian Bale, with his shaggy hair and beard and constant looked of pained shock, too closely resembled James Brolin in The Amityville Horror for me to loose myself in the simple story.  Nice for a rental, but nothing worth owning.
0060977493|3.0|THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS is the story of how things can change in a day.<br />It's the story of how the decisions of one day leads to the separation of a family: Ammu and her fraternal twins, Rahel and Estapen.<br />It's the story of forbidden love between a Touchable and and Untouchable in India.<br />It's the story of how young cousin Sophie Mol from London with her go-go-bag and drinking-from-a-thimble habit died.<br />The author, Arundhati Roy has created her own writing style. She creates words, creates grammar, creates poetry with her writing. The book is written like a memory of an event: events from childhood are remembered next to the ones from last year with equal value. Thus, her narrative jumps around in time, making the book, at times, difficult to follow. Her writing is genius, but her presentation doesn't necessarily keep the reader interested until the end. After page 100, I still wasn't sure what the book was about. Also, I didn't feel a connection with the characters. While they are well-developed, the author does not make a warm connection between the reader and the characters in the book. However, this book did win the Booker Prize. And it is memorable.<br />After a rocky beginning, this first-time-author became a better writer as she went along and will probably dazzle us with her next book.
0671510991|5.0|As much as I despise the policies and actions of Henry Kissinger, I must confess that I found this book to be a very well thought out look at the major historical events of the past century. Kissinger's central premise seems to be that the United States has swung back and forth between Wilsonian Idealism and a more pragmatic/Realpolitik perspective in which a nation is primarily responsible for looking out for its own best interests. While I deplore the lack of conscience or justice that Kissinger stands for, I found the book very helpful in understanding his position and in looking at world events through that particular lense. Certainly, he makes many valid and interesting points in addressing the relative pro's and con's of each approach. Also, the book is very readable - ideas are expressed clearly and it kept my interest throughout. <br />If you're interested in understanding the Realpolitik logic that has led to so many atrocities around the world, and how one might intellectually justify these actions, this book is an invaluable resource. Ultimately, whether you agree with Kissinger or not, I think it's important to understand him. The man is not simply \\"evil\\" or \\"insane\\" and the ideas that he represents are central to current U.S. policies around the world.<br />Important stuff, well articulated.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I downloaded a few of the songs off this CD and gave them to a friend.  She was completely blow away.  She went out and bought the CD after she found out who the artist was.  <br />I am as blown away as my friend.  This music is timeless.  It will be as good today, tomorrow, 10 years, 20 years, and 40 years from now.  Norah has a voice that is beyond star quality.  It transends her genre.  Totally flawless performances.  If she wants to, she will beome the next Billy Holiday, Bessie Smith, etc, without sounding especially like them.  She is that good.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Wu-Tang has several dope mc's but they all admitted back on 36 Chambers that the GZA was the head. Not in commercial appeal but lyrics. Liquid Swords is second only to Cuban Linx by the Chef in Wu-Tang solo projects. The beats are dark and grimey and the lyrics are vivid as a painting by Picasso...
B000001Y5J|4.0|This album contains a few of the hardest, loudest songs Trent Reznor has ever made. If you listen to this album more than twice in one day, your brain would probably start feeling like Trent's lungs probably do after shouting \\"Slave scream\\" through the devastating \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" song. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br />The 2 best songs on the album, \\"Last\\" and \\"Gave Up\\" (the latter can be heard in an amazing live music video set in the studio with the whole band. *hint* download it now! *hint*), are the extremely addictive, crank up the volume, destroy your grandparent's furniture with a hammer kind of songs that only Trent Reznor himself could make sound like something you wouldn't be suprised hearing on MuchMusic or the radio.<br />Even \\"Pinion\\" and \\"Help Me I am in Hell\\" are interesting to listen to, even though they're only like 15 seconds long.<br />Why didn't this get 5 stars? One word. \\"Physical\\". Skip to track 99 (yeah) instead, much much better.<br />PS: I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to find the music video for \\"Happiness in Slavery\\". Stick with the live version if you know what's good for ya.
B00005AQGH|4.0|1996 was a very sad year for the world of hip hop. Tupac was killed right before his album Makaveli was scheduled to drop. This was a very disturbing album because I was under the impression that Tupac unleashed all of his anger on All Eyes On Me. Makaveli is a dark and grimey album. Pac seemed to be on the verge on battling Biggie, Nas, Jay-Z, Dela Soul, Xibit and the entire Bad Boy Family. Hip Hop didn't need that at the time. Though the beats and lyrics are hot...it falls short of a classic due to it's vision...
0385335482|5.0|I loved this book! It was funny, witty, and a great escape from my own daily life! As a shopping queen I was excited about the book when I saw the title, but after reading it I learned that I have nothing on Becky when it come to shopping! heehee This is a book that I have cont to let friends borrow, cause I can't stop talking about it. It is an easy read once you get used the the British lingo...I finished it in 2 days!
B0000039QA|5.0|Biggie will always be the MC credited for putting BK back on the map after Big Daddy Kane. Biggie also is praised for releasing Ready to Die and being one of the reasons East Coast Hip hop didn't die...<BR>In comes Life After Death in 1997 released after his tragic murder. Biggie drops the second double disc ever in hip hop after the success of Tupac's All Eyes on Me was evident. I mean..don't the best clash at the top? LAD is a classic with tracks such as \\"Ni@@as Bleed\\", \\"Story to tell\\", \\"10 Cra@k Commandments\\", \\"Sky is the Limit\\", \\"Love the Dough\\" and the obvious lead singles...Is this album perfect? No...and this is because of the unecessary skits and 2-3 filler tracks..This is not a problem b/c there are so many classic songs on both disc.....you will not mind tapping the skip button every now and then....
B00007BH3Y|5.0|This is what a movie score should be.  Powerful, engrossing and just absolutely perfect.
B00001MXXH|5.0|This movie is great!!! Matthew Broderick is hillarious! This is about a teen who skips school and has the day off in Chicago. But the only problom is his principle knows he's faking and so does his sister, so they are trying to catch him. Its sooooo funny. everywhere he goes either his dad or mom, or sombody is there. but they always miss him. You must see this movie
B00005OMTT|4.0|The only new song is &quot;Turn Around&quot;, which I particularly enjoy. A couple other songs sound like parts have been remixed. Otherwise, these are all songs that I like, so I enjoyed the CD.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Discovering Cash's American series is in some respects like stumbling onto the Grand Canyon. How can you take it all in? You listen and stare and try to comprehend, but finally realize the thing before you transcends casual perception, defies description and attests to the existence of God. <br />Some reviews trip on the temptation to question and criticize the inclusion of this or that cover track. Such is a mistake for this body of work. Favorites emerge on these four albums, but what at first glance appears to be a hyper-eclectic and motley grab bag of songs is really one single table spread with the intertwined themes of death, hell, love and redemption. No single song is an island, and every piece is a part of the main. There is method to the madness. And so it makes no more sense to question the presence of a track than to criticize the ears on Michelangelo's David.<br />Consider \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" from this, the fourth album. Its inclusion struck me at first as an out-of-place and effeminate selection since that song had hitherto been Roberta Flak's signature love ballad. But here was the lesson in humility. Johnny drenches the track with so much authentic emotion (love), that it becomes his. I have never heard another artist so completely take over a cover song as he did with this one. You come away thinking this man just made sonic love to his woman, and wonder whether it was proper to have listened.<br />\\"The Beast in Me\\" from the first album, and \\"The Man Comes Around\\" from this album are the two best songs in the series, and perhaps in all of Cash-dom. I have to take the former in doses for the same reason one shouldn't sit too close to a fire.  As for \\"The Man Comes Around,\\" sound is only half the equation. One literally watches holographic images conjured up, assume space, and fly past in an apocalyptic slide show. <br />Finally, these are audiophile recordings. Excellent equipment is needed or you will miss some of the glory. This musicjustifies the expense of upgrading your speakers and your amplifier, but if you can't afford to do so now, at least get yourself some high-quality headphones such as from Sennheiser anything numbered HD-565 or greater). You wouldn't want to view the Grand Canyon through tinted windows.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This second installment of the Lord of the Ring series is simply amazing. The special effects will leave you breathless without sacrificing the story. The characters seem real in a story that could easily have been lost in special effects like Mr. George Lucas' Star War movies.
B00006RCPM|1.0|Just awful. This is one of those ridiculous, nothing-but-loud-noises action movies with little plot and less point. The basic premise seems like a good idea, but it's quickly abandoned, and the story becomes an oh-so-conventional revenge flick with the bad guy obvious from his first appearance. The movie reminded me a little of L.A. Confidential except that L.A. Confidential was a far superior movie, and it was in color. \\"Minority Report\\" might as well have been shot in black and white, as nothing but black and neutral shades were used, even in the greenhouse. Wait a minute. There were the balloons (like the little girl's red coat in \\"Schindler's List\\"), but that's it. Tom Cruise was once an actor, but this movie didn't require any acting, so he didn't do any. He just looks stupid. How can he watch himself in this kind of dreck? I was stunned when I heard Roger Ebert say it was his favorite movie of 2002.
0385508417|4.0|Have you ever tried to skip Christmas? Blair, Luther and Nora's only child, is away with the Peace Corps in Peru, so Luther and Nora decide to skip all the Holiday fanfare and expense and spend some money on themselves. Easier said than done, when the entire town is watching and campaigning for Christmas. Skipping includes saying no to the city's firemen when they come round to sell their horrid fruitcakes, no to the doe-eyed boy scouts selling Christmas trees, and no to the entire neighbourhood, that always sets up a huge Frosty on every roof. The ending was a bit of a disappointment, though. I wanted a light book to read over the Holidays and this hit the spot. I am probably one of the few people who has not read John Grisham before, but I enjoyed this book and have been favourably influenced towards his other works.
0385508417|4.0|What a great reminder of the true meaning of the season!<br />I can't get over the fact that this was Grisham.<br />I read this book in about 3 or 4 hours, not a huge time committment, and it's worth every minute.  The book is a perfect lesson that it's not the gifts, lights, cards, and other secular annoyances that take the spirit out of Christmas, it's how we choose to respond to them.  Grisham shows how many of the unpleasant tasks we associate with the holidays can prove to be an important part of the spirit of the season.  As an example, putting an 8 foot Frosty on your roof is not a pleasant task, but when everyone on the block works together to get it done, it transcends the annoyance and reminds the participants of the love of neighbor and peace that the season is supposed to represent.
0345350499|5.0|Ok, so everyone knows the tale of King Arthur and his queen, Gwenhyfar, right? Well, this book is a break-through novel of the tales of the women in the legend. There's Morgaine, the faerie woman, taught as a priestess in Avalon, which is the fading world of the Druids. There's Gwenhyfar, the High Queen of Britain, who's taught of the new ways, which is Christianity. She falls in love with Lancelet, Arthur's Companion. Ultimately, this is a woman's tale of how unfair it was to be a woman and in love with someone they're not married to. As my title says, this is the best book you'll ever read.
B00000JTB2|5.0|There is little about these two blues masters and this CD which are not the best you could hear.  A small, perhaps trivial decline in the presentation on this CD is the fault of the producer rather than the players, when the talking in between hotly moving blues songs--mainly by Albert as he talks about Jimi (Hendrix) and Janis (Joplin), which would be better placed on a history or documentary CD, rather than the red hot blues which these two late, great blues guitar players and singers are known for.  Stevie Ray Vaughan (SRV) is always an absolute joy to listen to, as he is probably the best blues guitar player EVER, at least in my opinion.  Hendrix may have been more creative, but SRV's guitar phrasing goes one on one with Hendrix, or any blues player, including Albert King.  Of course, SRV created a blues style of his own that is unrivaled.<br />Enjoy this CD!
B000002UDB|5.0|As far as music is concerned, The Beatles may even have outperformed themselves. Not only were over  dozen hits spawned from this album but similar to their other major successes they weren't going to fade in and out of the public's respect/recognition. Had Hit chronicles been the thing back in the 60's as they are today, this listing could easily have passed for a tolerable deception of the decade. Although the music is all what keeps these five stars aligned, had they refrained from dressing up on the cover in psychedelic, TV-hustled ape suits like a road circus without wheels, this album would probably have received their greatest demand of any maybe including Sgt. Pepper's. Nevertheless, the FabFour seldom failed to do things their way (mysteriously stoned or not) and that I'm near certain is how they've kept their title as history's best loved and appreciated Rock `N Roll band...
B00005O3VC|4.0|I know many other reviewers have brought this up, but on a SONY DVD player, during certain scenes, rabbits and subtitles pop up unintentionally. There is a rabbit feature: when a rabbit comes up, you click on it, and it tells you production secrets (it is called &#34;the killer rabbit&#34;). This is great if you like that, but if you're not interested in it, there's no real way around it. Every thirty seconds, you have rabbits popping up, even when you turn them off. This DVD is actually cheaper than the one-disc bare bones edition, yet people have spent more money to get that just so they don't have to deal with these stupid rabbits.<br /><br />The frustrating thing is, this DVD wasn't just slapped together. The picture looks crystal clear compared to old copies on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. The high definition widescreen presentation looks amazing; it's by far the best I've seen this film look. The soundtrack has a very loud 5.1 that is very cool, especially if you've always heard the film in mono. (If you prefer mono, it's there, too.)<br /><br />There are two commentary tracks, with 4 of the actors on one and the 2 directors on the other. I know that the one with the 2 directors is taken from the Criterion Laserdisc, which is neither good not bad. The scene selection is okay, and the extra 24 seconds are unnecessary. Disc two has sing alongs, documentaries of the Holy Grail locations today, &#34;How to use your Coconuts&#34; (which is hilarious), &#34;MPHG in Japanese&#34; (which is okay), &#34;A load of rubbish&#34; (which is bad), &#34;On location with the Pythons&#34; (An 18-minute documentary made in 1974 by BBC), Terry Gilliam's original sketches, and a bunch of other stuff. Despite the subtitles and rabbits, what a deal! Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave helpful/not helpful feedback.at a deal! The VHS is slightly cheaper than this. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave helpful/not helpful feedback.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Can't Take Me Home sheds no light on Missundazstood. Why? Pink does a complete 360 in between projects. Instead of being force fed her hip-hop R&B, Pink is allowed to showcase her writing abilities - and the kind of music that is inside of her. Great tracks on this CD vary from the hip-hoppy 'Get This Party Started' to the gritty 'Just Like A Pill' to the emotional 'Family Portrait'. Other notable songs include 'Missundazstood', 'Numb' and 'Misery'. It impresses me very much that alot of young female artists have really grown up. Other than Pink's turn around on this record, there's also notably Christina Aguilera on 'Stripped', Mariah Carey on 'Charmbracelet' and J. Lo on 'This is Me...Then'. My hat is off to Pink for her phenomenal effort on this CD, and producing wonderful songs.
B00005JKBC|1.0|Potential was there in this movie. Whether I was in a bad mood or not, I don't know, but this was sooo slow. I was not captivated by the plot and Brad Pitt was not believable in his role and I didn't feel connected with the story. If you liked movies like Apocalypse Now or even AI you may enjoy it. Patriot Games and The Hunt For Red October were better movies. Far better \\"Spy\\" movies are out there. This was well filmed and the production was good.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers is a horror thriller in the vein of 80's &quot;old school&quot; style, which means it relies on atmosphere over a hip soundtrack (which it doesn't have, at all) and the teen cast from Dawson's Creek.  Rather, we get two unknown actors to play the part, a genuinely intense score, and some truly effective camerawork and stylishness to build suspense.  There's a decent amount of gore, too, for those interested.  <br />The two leads are very good, playing off each other very believably as a brother/sister duo who truly care for one another.  The film moves at a fast pace, and its knockout finale breaks some genre cliches.  The final scene might not go well with some, but it's a shocking close to a terrific frightfest.
0783225857|5.0|The film adaptation of Harper Lee's classic novel is spellbindingly wonderful.

And despite the colored images on the box, the film remains in it original, glorious black and white.
B000000H5K|2.0|This is a pretty dissapointing release by Sepultura. Since I like to buy my records in chronological order, I was expecting something like \\"Arise\\", \\"Chaos A.D.\\", or \\"Beneath The Remains.\\" This album is way to Nu-Metal influenced, and is pretty repetitive. There are some good tracks, such as Attitude, but there are many weak tracks that are either, too repetitive, boring, or just plain [bad]. If you want a good Sepultura album, get one of these: Morbid Visions/Bestial Devestation, Schizophrenia, Beneath The Remains, Arise, or Chaos A.D.  I'm not saying you shouldn't get \\"Roots\\", you might like it, there are some good songs. I'll still occasionally pop this in my cd player for a listen.
B00006LHYC|5.0|I hadn't heard of Laura until 10/15/02 when I was at a free AOL show to advertise 8.0 in New York when a screen playing Laura Pausini's SURRENDER music video appeared from nowhere. Who was this person, and why were they showing her video? I soon found out, because she was suddenly on stage 5 yards from me lip-syncing the video, emerging from the darkness. Then the audio turned off, and she proceeded to sing the song live. By the time she'd left, she's sung SURRENDER and IF THAT'S LOVE. She'd captivated the audience; they loved her.<br />I have to admit, the two songs didn't particularly *amaze* me, but I very much admired her ability to get up and so splendidly perform in front of an easy 2000+ audience that didn't even know who she was. So I bought the CD on 12/03/02. I have loved it ever since. It absolutely spooks me to think that this talented lady was standing feet from me and I had no idea of just how great she was when the event was happening. It's very frustrating, but also an experience to remember; one like no other. The CD really amazed me that much. Songs like the rocking LOVE COMES FROM THE INSIDE, innocent yet excellent pop like EVERY DAY IS A MONDAY and SURRENDER as well as pure Celine-esque balladry with tunes like IT'S NOT GOODBYE and IF THAT'S LOVE all stick like ear candy. However, the best 2 tracks here are both versions of EVERY LITTLE THING YOU DO, an absolutely beautiful song, particularly the piano/vocal reprise version. (A little story behind the song: Laura recorded it with the same microphone Madonna recorded her hit FROZEN with. While recording Madonna would put her gum on the microphone. For luck, Laura did this too.) Indeed, Laura did not need the luck. How modest of her to think she needed any. One listen and you will certainly know she did not. Almost definitely after one full listen to this album and you will want to explore Laura's Italian and Spanish outings dating back to 1993; I know I do; I very much look forward to expanding my Laura collection past this CD. She is definitely an artist for you to be keeping your eye on. (The remixes of SURRENDER reached #5 on the HOT DANCE MUSIC/CLUB PLAY Billboard charts and are now at #7. They too are available as a cool CD-Maxi single that makes a nice companion to FROM THE INSIDE, and getting a copy soon would be a wise move-it's already out of print.)y Laura collection past this CD.

B000002H2H|5.0|This is a great album, my second favorite from Metallica. It is amazing how much they matured from 1983's \\"Kill Em'All\\" (which is still an awesome record). both lyrically and musically.Here is a rundown of each track. <br />1)Fight Fire With Fire-Starts off with a classical intro, and then becomes the fastest song Metallica has ever done. The lyrics could have been better, but the music is great. 8/10<br />2)Ride The Lightning- A six and a half minute song about the death penalty, this is one of my favorite Metallica songs of all-time. 10/10<br />3)For Whom The Bell Tolls- Slow, but heavy. This was the second song I learned to play on bass, I love the intro. Great lyrics.<BR>10/10<br />4)Fade To Black- Metallica's first ballad, which is about suicide. Great lyrics and music, although I like \\"Welcome Home\\" from Master Of Puppets and \\"One\\" from Justice a bit more. 10/10<br />5)Trapped Under Ice- Fast thrash song with good soloing. Not much more to say on this one. 7/10<br />6)Escape- This is an o.k. song, I like the verses, but the chorous is pretty cheesy. Still not bad, however. 6/10<br />7)Creeping Death- A fan favorite. It is about the book of Exodus in the bible.Excellent song, one of my favorites.10/10<br />8)The Call Of Ktulu- A nine minute instrumental, almost as good as \\"Orion\\", but can get a tad repetitive. 10/10<br /> Buy this record now, you will not be dissapointed. After that, buy Kill Em All, And Justice For All, and Master Of Puppets.
B00006LHUW|5.0|This CD single is most certainly worth owning if you full-fledgedly like Norah's album. It contains the splendid, lush, absolutlely dreamy and 20's-esque Jones-penned title track to the LP and is backed with 2 exclusive and outstanding live takes of TURN ME ON and COLD COLD HEART. On TURN ME ON she laughs and says, &quot;I guess I'll start now.&quot; Both songs segue into each other. The intimacy of the live setting as well as the presence of an extremely thrilled and clapping audience members makes these takes arguably better than those on the album.<br />MY ADVICE: Get the album first. It is almost the same price of the single as it is. If you then love the album, buy this CD. It will be worth its price to you.
B000065V3H|5.0|I've waited 3 years for this DVD!  I love it.  I love it.  I love it!  It was my movie back in the 80's.  Fabulous acting, writing and directing.  Thank you for making such a great movie about popularity and peer preasure!  I love the humor you made with it also.  Thanks again!!
6300271439|5.0|I was very surprised when I saw this movie the other day just how great it was. I was expecting maybe a decent movie predominantly featuring Madonna's 4 songs from the soundtrack and a laid back script that probably wouldn't make much sense. Well, the plot did NOT make sense, but to be fair, it didn't make sense in classic 80's fashion. What we have here is arguably one of the best comedies of the late 80's. (I read another person's review of this where they said Desperately Seeking Susan was a better movie but not as funny. I agree. DSS was slightly better, but not nearly as funny.) Of course, this movie is much more Madonna than DSS was. Griffen Dunne is priceless as a young, engaged lawyer trying to keep Nikki (Madonna) in line as a favor for his fiance's father. No matter what he does he does not succeed. It's bad enough that he also has to pick up a rare species of panther, his fiance's father's &quot;pet&quot;. When Nikki leaves prison, he tries to take control of her and make sure she gets on the bus to Philadelphia as planned. Before he knows it, she is driving his in laws' car, or rather body-slamming it through suburban traffic. She also boosts tapes from a mall (you get a glimpse of longbox CDs in there) and gets a man arrested just so she can do so. By the end of the day...so much 80's-esque zany comedic situation has occurred you won't believe it. You won't be able to stop laughing, especially when they are chasing a UPS man in hot pursuit of a priceless necklace WHILE being chased by 2 men they thought they ditched who have a rift with Nikki. Just hilarious, and then, the next day, Dunne's wedding day. You can imagine! WHO'S THAT GIRL is a priceless comedy, bargain-bin 80's style, and one that should not be missed by fans and non-fans of Madonna. I certainly hope it's released on DVD soon. It deserves to be.
B00003CXI0|5.0|i loved the 2nd movie!<BR>it stayed loyal to the book<BR>i did miss some parts like nerly headless nick's party.<BR>but i liked it non the less!<BR>i truly recommend it!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I absoulutely loved this soundtrack I thought it sounded perfect for a movie like this one. It does stand on its own so that it not only will be nice to listen to in the movie, but also by itself.  I highly recommend this one to everyone!!!
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is a classic.  Arguably, the best piece album ever.  Will not go wrong with the album.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It's very rare that I find a CD that I like every single song on it. This one is one of those rare finds. I listen to it all the time. One thing I LOVE is that I can 100% relate to the majority of her songs. You can really tell that this album comes from her heart and is not fabricated like her previous one. I recommended this CD to all my friends. They bought it and they all loved it too.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|After a four year drought when Maiden seemed all but dead with classic members Bruce Dickensen and Adrian Smith long gone, Maiden retured in 2000 with renewed energy and a sound and style that puts most contemporary metal bands to shame.  The classic '80s lineup is back along with '90s member Jannick Gers adding a THIRD guitar to the sound.  Maiden then proceeds to churn out ten songs, almost all destined to become mainstays of their catalog.  We have rockers as only Maiden could write them (Wicker Man, Fallen Angel), grandiose epics (Dream of Mirrors,  Ghost of the Navigator) and songs I still have to define because only Iron maiden knows how to do them well (Brave New World, Nomad).  <br />Along with Maiden's renewed furvor, producer Kevin Shirley (Black Crowes) makes this record one of the best sounding Maiden has ever done.  A lush wall of sound bolsters the firey guitars, giving them extra power and presence.  He also stretches the vocal prowess of singer Bruce Dickinsen to new territory; Bruce can't scream like he used, but when he hits those high notes in full voice and you don't feel something rise in your chest, you had better check your pulse.  And even without his screaming abilities now limited, this record arguably holds Bruce's best vocal performance in Maiden ever.<br />But even with the fine production, vocals and songs, without Maiden's musicianship and arranging skills, this record would have fallen apart.  The three guitars are surprisingly organized and streamlined, and drummer Nicko McBrain turns his his best drumming on a Maiden record ever.  Its lively, spirited but also muscular and shows off his stunning rhymic abilities.  And bassist Steve Harris is as always a wonder on the 4-string, pounding away to help foundate the records sound.<br />This record is so almost perfect, that the flaws are not even worth mentioning.  The album's many strengths easliy make up for them.  Maiden gave metal a rude awakening it sorely needed with Judas Preist declining and most other  classic metal bands fading to the assault of aggro and punk pop.  Those aggro et. al. bands can barely gravel at Eddie's feet, and can barely touch Maiden's longevity and power. And even after 25 years, this record proves Maiden is still one of the best bands of all time.
B000066NW0|5.0|A more triumphant debut from such a young artist I can't commit to recent memory.  Not since Fiona Apple's amazing \\"Tidal\\" have I ever been so taken by an album by such a young female artist.  After having first heard Avril on the catchy , yet overplayed (9,205 spins in a week) \\"complicated\\", I had much interest in what the rest of her music would sound like.  I was not disappointed.  Next came \\"sk8ter boi\\", although a little fast for my taste, I was left hungry for more.  Then, I heard \\"I'm with you\\", which immediately reminded me of a Fiona Apple song.<BR>The string music has an awesome effect that builds up to the powerful chorus.  After hearing this, I knew she was something special, and I must have her album.  The opener, the Alanis-reminiscent \\"losing grip\\", hits hard and really shows what Avril is capable of vocally.  The fifth track, \\"Mobile\\" has that quiet verse/strong chorus feel, and keeps the album uptempo.  The next track, the anger-stricken \\"unwanted\\", may be the most powerful and sharp-cutting song on the album, really a showing of Avril's brilliant writing skills, not to mention vocals.  The soft spoken \\"tomorrow\\" follows and shows Avril's versatility as an artist as she can sing anything from angry, on-the-brink-of-revenge songs to somber ballads.  \\"Anything but ordinary\\" is a musical snapshot of the young Canadian's life, as she strives to always live life to the fullest, very sage advice.  \\"Things I'll never say\\" is a clever play on words, while \\"my world\\" is a lighter look into Avril's life as she talks about things such as washing her hair in the shower.  Yet another showing of her versatility is exhibited on \\"nobody's fool\\", as Avril raps her way through a can't-bring-me-down, no-nonsense attitude song.  Avril wonders why she can't get a relationship to work and moves on on \\"too much to ask\\", a swirling, done-me-wrong track.  The album closes with \\"naked\\", as she discusses \\"revealing\\" herself to her partner, yet another well-written song to close the album.  So, let's review:  An absolutely brilliant, well-written (she either wrote or co-wrote every song on the album), versatile album from the young Canadian.  She also plays the guitar and can sing with a range that most \\"bubble gum pop stars\\" would give their right arm for.  The scary thing is this is only her first album, I can only imagine what she may be capable of as she grows as an artist.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this album.  Album of the Year?  Possibly.  Are other young singers like Britney Spears, and other talentless-by-comparison pop stars' careers in trouble?  Definitely...<br />Avril is the future of music... 'nuff said.
B00005JL78|5.0|Tom Cruise in the future of the United States, three psychics, cool looking cars from the year 2054, and a crime-free D.C. . . . all in all, a stunning movie that left me gaping in absolute awe of what was happening.<BR>Despite the fact that it could never happen in the real world, this movie describes how genetically grown, drug-induced psychics show crimes before they happen, giving the police an opportunity to stop murder, rape, and crimes of passion before they occur.  The only legal flaw is that the people arrested through this system have not, in fact, committed any crime, and by the Constitution, criminals are innocent until proven guilty.<BR>But past all that, WHAT AN AMAZING MOVIE!<BR>Tom Cruise portays an officer in the perfect crime-stopping system who is forseen murdering a man he doesn't even know, yet.  His next move is to try to find out who set him up, which ultimately creates a complicated chain of events, including a morbidly amusing scene in which Cruise chases his own eyeballs down a ramp. <BR>Also delivering an amazing performance is Samantha Morton, the female psychic Agatha, who sees John Asterton (Cruise)commit the murder.<BR>Morton shows that she can deliver a range of extreme emotion and stress, desperation, fear, exhaustion, confusion, and simple bewilderment of the everyday world.<BR>Reminiscent of an episode of CSI, with no actual crime occurring!    A wonderful choice for your DVD collection, with a plot thick enough to strangle an elephant!
B00005JKNB|2.0|Once more Jim Carrey makes a bid to be taken seriously as an actor. First the overrated, whimsical slop that was THE TRUMAN SHOW and then the above average biopic MAN ON THE MOON in which nobody learns anything, because nobody knew much about Andy Kaufman to begin with. THE MAJESTIC is Jim's third shot at mainstream respectability, and though it wants to be a Capra homage, despite Carrey's good performance the movie is sloppy, tiresome, poorly constructed and has enough sticky sweet sentiment to have diabetics upchucking for a week.<BR>Carrey plays Peter Appleton, a Hollywood screenwriter in the 50s who finds himself blacklisted just as his career is starting to take off. Not surprisingly Pete is none too pleased about this so he decides a spot of drink driving is called for. He soon crashes his car off a bridge, escapes virtually unscathed and ends up in a small town called Lawson with a severe case of memory loss. Here an old man (Martin Landau) mistakes him for his son, Luke Trimble; a missing WW2 hero. This miracle inspires the town to reopen the town's long defunct Majestic movie theatre and rediscover the joy in their lives. Give me a break!<BR>Director/ producer Frank Darabont must have spent many days umming and ahhing over this project, but then somebody probably pointed out to him that he still needs to work until Stephen King writes another novel set in a prison. So Frank took the sensible route and made this Crapraesque slop. Please Steve, get typing and spare us from Frank making more movies like this!!
B00005JKCH|4.0|This movie is a fun take from the comic book character. Never a dull moment. It does have cinematic flaws and the story line is doesn't always make sence, so don't take it too seriously!<BR>Fun movie for the family.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I have not yet listned to this record, but I loved it. The musicianship is very professional and the lyrcis are first rate. The English version is my favorite but the French and the Finish versions are also worth the purchase prices. The Korean leaves a lot to be desired as is usually the case with all Korean music.
B00006SFLV|5.0|Well, I finally got my hands on the box set and I was sooo happy! I was also relieved because I dont have a multi-region DVD player, but it still works. Its not only for the US/Canada. But anyhow... It was *so good* going back and visiting Angela, Rayanne, Rickie, Brian, etc... *heaven*
B00005QCYD|4.0|I got this DVD for Christmas, and I liked it. I think it's by far better than any of the other Jurassic Park movies. The raptors are better than ever. They are always good, but, in this movie they were the best. The plot could have been better and longer. But, this movie sure is worth your money!
0060512806|4.0|An interesting read, it respects history while adding fictional details and twisting events to connect everything in a nice little package.  However, the Deus Ex Machina ending left me feeling cheated, much as Snow Crash.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This movie is my second favorite! I loved this movie ever since I saw it on SCI-FI! I went out and bought and watched it all in one night! I love Pennywise. He is funny one moment, then creepy the next. This is by far the best story by Stephen King. I love the horror and gory parts in it. Especially the \\"Tea Time\\" chapter! This is well worth the money if you want a good scare!
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera debut on the musical landscape in 1999 within the teen pop phenomenon. Her initial musical style, though containing various soulful tinges, was more pop. Something that is expected when she came out during the pop boom. Before receiving the CD and waiting for it, I was wondering the style her CD would be. 2001 and 2002 included much rock music. Many singers who previously had a different musical styling abandoned them in order to latch onto the rock wave. For instance, Pink did this in 2001, Destiny's Child 2001 CD was more rock oriented than their previous effort. I was hoping that Christina would go more soulful, hip-hop and that is what she primarily has done. Though I must admit that I was kind of reluctant about the whole CD when I heard that she worked with Linda Perry on her CD. If you dont know, Linda Perry worked with Pink on most of her latest CD-Missundaztood. Though I respect Linda Perry as an artist and producer, I simply dont like her music much. But thats another story.<br />Can't Hold Us Down-One of the more commercial uptempos on the disc. This song has a rap from Lady Marmalade collaboration Lil Kim. It is a very tell-it like it is song that gives Christina some \\"street\\" credibility if anything. A+<br />Walk Away-A very soulful effort with very deep meaning. The song just slowly builds up until the climax or crescendo where Christina just simply lets loose and gives it to us straight. The song before this was a surprise but this one coming from Christina surprised me even more. A<br />Fighter-Somewhere between rock and r&b as it contains elements of both. The song runs along the lines of self-empowerment from a not-too-good relationship. A-<br />Infatuation-A Latin-tinged uptempo with Christina talking about being stuck between momma's words and what she feels inside. This definitely has potential to become a single. A+<br />Loving Me for Me-Even more soulful and more subdued than Walk Away. Now this song right here is the highlight of the CD as it is arguably the best song. Christina shows that screaming and all the histrionics are not required to make a good song with a good voice. This certainly puts Christina more on the soulful radar. A+<br />Impossible-Song was more pumped up and promoted just because Alicia Keys is a collaborator. It is not bad at all but there is something missing in the song. It seems kinda soulful then again there is some other strange qualities therein. Nonetheless, it is a nice song but it just doesnt go where you would expect it to. A-<br />Underappreciated-R&B song that is kinda similar to Fighter with a lot of attitude coming from Christina. A-<br />Beautiful-The only song on the disc by Linda Perry that I like and I must admit that I do not like this that much either. I am proud that is gaining success in the many formats that it has. It contains a great, empowerment message but I do not like the arrangement of the song because it does in some ways hold back from the song taking off to where it needs to go but it is a great song. A-<br />Make Over-One word-horrible. This sounds like something Tori Amos or Hole WOULD NOT even sing. Why Christina stooped to this level to sing this crap, I dont know. But I always skip this one. D<br />Cruz-With the way the song is spelled, I thought that maybe it was gonna be something that I would like. However, once I saw that Linda Perry produced it, I became worried. THough not as bad as Cruz, it definitely isnt as good as Beautiful. I skip this one as well. B-<br />Soar-This contains elements of many music stylings as it has a little folk, a little pop, some soul and some gospel. A very encouraging song that hits the mark better than Beautiful. However, Beautiful is more commercial. A<br />Get Mine, Get Yours-The instrumentation, the voice and everything is fine but I just do not like the content of the song as she is talking about just getting some,[] which is definitely something that shouldnt be encouraged. But I wont go there. A-<br />Dirrty-The decent all around single that we all know about whether because of the video, hearing it on the radio or the publicity that surrounded it. B+<br />Voice Within-Kinda dark, Mariah Carey sounding effort that sounds like Reflection. It has more depth than Reflection and is defintiely a tight song. A+<br />I'm Ok-Kinda similar to Pink's Family Portrait but this sounds worse. I cant say much about it because I havent heard it much. This is another that I skip over. C+<br />Singing My Song-very similar to Soar but a little better. It has the same empowerment sentiment as Soar and Beautiful with some hints of gospel interspersed throughout which is great. A+<br />Overall, this is a very adequate sophomore effort. It seems like from this CD that one can get a better and more intimate understanding of Christina. She defintiely does strip it down in  many ways and is not just singing manufactured music but somehting that she likes to which is not bad. The only missteps are Cruz, Make Over and I'm Ok. I dont like their production and the vocals are not that good. That is just something I cannot get around but otherwise a great CD!
0767818040|1.0|Wow, what a clunker!<br />First of all, I could not believe that Leonard Maltin gave this 1 1/2 stars, should have been a [flop] for sure. After watching this bottom of the barrel, B-grade junk, I thought I'd have a look on Amazon, and see what sort of reviews this thing got from viewers around the world. Just for a laugh.<br />As it got some 5 star opinions, I was moved to actually write my very first Amazon review, ever. Let's start by saying, I like movies. I have a DVD collection of very slightly under 1,000 titles, and still building. My shelves range from \\"Citizen Kane\\" to \\"Baise Moi\\". Favourite is probably \\"Pulp Fiction\\".<br />I have to say \\"Body Double\\" is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is also the first DVD I've had to throw out.<br />So what's wrong with it?<br />1. Acting is below B-grade, below 1970's Italian exploitation flicks.  In particular Craig Wasson is so unremittingly wooden and pathetically bad that he could not hold down a gig on daytime TV.<br />2. As a supposedly erotic movie, if fails miserably, cringingly and completely in that department. Melanie Griffith looks like she'd rather be somewhere else, and who can blame her. Try \\"Bound\\" or \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" instead. As for Melanie, she was more erotic in \\"Milk Money\\".<br />3. Continuity - non-existent. Editing also very poor.<br />4. Intent?? Serious thriller, all out comedy?? We actually switched this thing off about half way through. Then we said - hang on, these guys could not have been serious, there must be some huge punchline coming, or a complete turnaround a-la \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\"... So we wasted another 50 minutes, and it just got worse.<br />5. Direction: DePalma must have been out to lunch for this one, and left the guy who gets the coffee in charge. I mean, this just went nowhere.<br />6. Locale used : some reviewers have praised the use of locale, but it really was used in the blandest fashion only. For an example of a movie that makes the most of a good locale, watch \\"Charlotte Gray\\", and think again.<br />7. Suspense : None. Wholly predictable from the start, we picked who was under the indian mask when ...
6305169187|4.0|This sci-fi film is supensful and will leave you hanging on the edge of your seat.  It's the best sci-fi film I've ever seen!  You'll never want it to end!  Great Buy
B000070WJE|4.0|Being a devoted fan of Robbie for several years I am without a doubt thrilled by Escapology and his contract which promises more albums to come.  As one can imagine since Robbie has been spending a lot of time in the US away from his crazed British fans, Escapology is very different from his previous work.  We can sense a sort of maturity in his music and lyrics, a moving away from the standard pop song.  The styles range from rock ('Song 2'), to slow ballads ('Something Beautiful', 'Love Somebody', 'Sexed up'), and even the bizare mariachi sounding 'Me and My Monkey' to name a few.  Robbie has not completeley abandoned his self-righteous persona, as we can tell from the title alone of 'World's Most Handome Man.'  But he also expresses his humility in the contradictory 'Come Undone.'  <BR>All in all the album is great except for one thing:  it's missing a catchy single  to attract and win over the American audience.  All I can say is more power to the promoters at Virgin in selling 'Feel' to the to the US market and making Robbie Williams a household name in America.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Other reviewers below have praised Norah's debut CD more eloquently and completely, so I won't bother to repeat their words.<br />But I do want to add an angle: I think part of this recording's success is its thematic consistency.  Look at your own collection: how many albums can you just put on CD-shuffle and know that for the next hour the music will be perfect for a certain mood?  Not many.   An album featuring a little of everything -- rock, ballad, fast, slow -- means that some tracks will always go against the mood you wanted to be in.  Hence your shelf is full of CDs that, while interesting, never make it back into your player on some quiet Saturday afternoon.  For example, the Fleetwood Mac collection: the other day I wanted their mellow pop tunes, and instead &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot; (live) came surging and snarling out of my speakers. That's the downside of artistic variety. <br />The upside of a disc like Norah's is its simple integrity.  Perfect songwriting, instrumentation, voice and arrangement.  Less is more.  And best of all, she and her team never depart from it, never once messing with the perfect mood they have created.  This is a CD that can easily pass the &quot;CD shuffle&quot; test, again and again.<br />By the way, if you love this one, you might like Madeleine Peyroux's one and only CD, &quot;Dreamland&quot;, which came out in 1996.  She was also age 22 at the time, and I still don't know how a young white girl in the 1990s could channel Billie Holiday so well.  I hope Norah will be much more prolific than Madeleine turned out to be.
0767812166|5.0|I last saw Starman when I was about 10, and I haven't forgotten it since - it's a great film that never fails to awaken 80's nostalgia.<br />Nowadays this fact doesn't surprise me all that much, as almost all of Carpenter's films are great and nostalgia-inspiring. I guess what I'm trying to say is, Carpenter's films are the best, and having Jeff Le... Bridges is just the icing on the cake.
B00000F1D3|4.0|1998 and Cher changes her persona once again...<BR>I guess she and Madonna are the two people in this business that continuously evolve and change their looks and style.<BR>And if these are the results, any change is welcome!<BR>Honestly: would you have thought it possible to hear Cher going dance?<BR>Well, apparently the lady believed she needed to change directions, so she set aside AOR and went for the dancefloor.<BR>She teamed up with - then - unknown producing team Metro (they guys have come a long way since this album...) and took by storm the international charts.<BR>BELIEVE, the titletrack, is along with ALL OR NOTHING one of the best tunes off the album.<BR>STRONG ENOUGH is reminiscent of the early '80's disco flavour, while Diane Warren steps in - surprisingly - with a TAKING BACK MY HEART, not a ballad for once.<BR>The big bad ballad is DOV'E' L'AMORE? - and yes guys, this is italian...not spanish...although the spanish guitar solo - and Cher delivers the italian lines without ANY accent.<BR>The song is sad, beautiful and will always be a memory of the time Sakis and i spent together...<BR>After the disappointing covers album, this one is a true feast for your ears...<BR>Make some room and get on the floor!
0385503954|5.0|Fiction told from a child's perspective usually annoys me. Reason: In my experience, this is often a lazy writer's tool for conveying a superficial, albeit sometimes insightful, comment on adult situations. This bias made me a reluctant reader of \\"Atonement\\", since the first section of the book conveys the perspective of Briony Tallis, a 13-year old girl. Yet this is no ordinary girl, since her mind is a powerful mixture of romance, heroic assertiveness, and sexual innocence. Interestingly, I found the chapter featuring her immature point of view to be richer than chapters told from the point of view Robbie-- a soldier, trudging through France, wounded and headed for evacuation at Dunkirk-and Cecilia-a young woman whose life is powered by anger toward her parents. And, don't pay attention to certain critics! Everything ties together very nicely.
B000006OS2|1.0|I have the video and the DVD for this movie. My copy of the DVD is horrible. Goodtimes replicated the DVD and it has lines and blurriness throughout. I am a John Wayne fanatic and was very disappointed in the DVD. The video I have is by MPI and it is in much better shape then the DVD. If you plan to buy this movie...WAIT until someone does it right!!
0679731377|5.0|There are ten wonderful and oddly connected stories in this book, each told in a different voice and set in a different milieu. Each stands on its own as a provocative work, each with virtuoso narrative flow. Yet, as I read this book, I had the feeling that the stories, great as they are, don't really form a connected work. Then, in his chapter \\"Parenthesis\\", Barnes explains why. \\"The history of the world? Just voices echoing in the dark; images that burn for a few centuries and then fade; stories, old stories that sometimes seem to overlap; strange links, impertinent connections. ...And while we fret and writhe... we make up a story to cover the facts we don't know or can't accept; we keep a few true facts and spin a new story round them. Our panic and our pain are only eased by soothing fabulation; we call it history.\\"<br />This idea about history is certainly true. But it does create a book, fine though it is, that doesn't build narrative power from chapter to chapter. This would be a serious flaw in a lesser writer. But with Barnes, my verdict is highly recommended.
B000066NW0|3.0|ok, this girl has a cool voice,it isn't so annoying like michelle and vanessa voices, but her songs are worse.<BR>this cd has some catchy songs, but it seems she doesn't have lot of imagination to write. i really like &quot;i'm with you&quot; or &quot;naked&quot;, i think they are beautiful songs, but the rest of the cd doesn't worth your money, &quot;nobody's fool&quot; will make you laugh, &quot;losing grip&quot; gets on my nerves, I'm sick of &quot;complicated&quot;, &quot;things i'll never say&quot; is really catchy like &quot;anything but ordinary&quot;.<BR>now is your choice...<BR>i give this cd 3 stars. because of her voice, she co-wrote most of the album and for the songs &quot;i'm with you&quot; and &quot;naked&quot;
B000002HJD|5.0|I would have to say that this is my favorite cd of all time. It has a little bit of everything in. The music is amazing and the words are unforgetable. It is moody, dark, spiritual and even a little mystical. I love the Doors and this is a must have for anyone who is serious about Jim Morrison or the Doors.
B00005RFAI|4.0|this cd is cool and pink seems to have a gift to write cool lyrics, her voice is cool and strong. my favourites songs on the album are: &quot;Eventually&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot; which is a duet with steven tyler,&quot;Numb&quot;,&quot;M!ssundaztood&quot;, &quot;Just like a pill&quot;, and &quot;Respect&quot;.<BR>this is a cool cd and you should buy it...
B00005JLS0|4.0|Cute movie, but once again Hugh Grant plays the rich guy determined never to get married, smiling, smirking his way thru this film and full of charm.  Sandra Bullock is the girl next door, who cleans up strikingly well.  There are some skyline scenes of NY that make you want to be there too.  Good music.
B00005R2M3|5.0|ok, so how to start this? Shakira is really good, fantastic, her songs are really good, seriously, i don't know where did she get those lyrics, here is my review of each song on the album:<br />1.Objection (tango)- definitly the reason why i bought this album, it kicks ass \\"next to her cheap silicon i look minimal\\" i love this part. 10/10<br />2.Underneath your clothes-this is a beautiful ballad, and her voice is really good here. 9.5/10<br />3.whenever, wherever- when i heard this song i didn't really liked it, but it grew on me and now i love it. 10/10<br />4.Rules-I normally skip this song, but it is not bad.6/10<br />5.The One-this one is really good, her voice is great here and the lyrics are really good, one of my favourites on the album.10/10<br />6.ready for the good times-i don't really like this song, but it has cool lyrics.5/10<br />7.Fool-this one is one og my favourites too, great lyrics and her voice is fantastic here.10/10<br />8.Te dejo Madrid- this one is really cool, i love shakira in spanish.10/10<br />9.poem to a horse-cool lyrics, but i always skip this one.6/10<br />10.Que me quedes tú-i love this this song, very cool lyrics.9/10<br />11.Eyes like yours - i prefer this one in spanish (ojos así), but it stills one of the best songs on the album.9.5/10<br />12.Suerte- is the version of whenever,wherever is spanish , it is cool, but i prefer the english version.9/10<br />13.Te aviso, Te anuncio(tango)-this is the version of objection in spanish, and i really like this one in spanish.10/10<br />so my finally coment is Shakira Rocks...buy this cd, and you will not be disapointed.
B00005JL78|1.0|This was probably the worst movie of 2002. Steven Spielberg has definetely lost his edge. Minority Report started out promising only to fade to the ranks of \\" miserable\\" after the first hour. Tom Cruise tries to give a fresh performance, but he, along with all the other actors in the film, end up giving performances that are as exciting as cardboard cut-outs. <BR>Visually, the movie is stunning, however all the special effects cannot hide the fact the movie is doomed from the start- doomed by a hideous script. In short, Minority Report is a film that is a total contradiction of itself.<BR>In the film, in the year 2054, murder can be prevented through the use of psychics or as the film calls them \\" Pre-Cogs\\", who can predict murder before it happens. Cruise is the top lawman of the agency which apprehends suspects before they can kill. One day at work, Cruise discovers that the \\"Pre-Cogs\\" have foreseen that he will commit a murder in less than 2 days. Soon, we are watching the futuristic version of \\" The Fugitive\\". However, Cruise is no Harrison Ford.<BR>Cruise, finding himself on the run, has no choice but to hunt for the man he will supposedly kill. From here, the movie begins to fall with Cruise making alliances that are unbelievable, characters than come and go on a whim, and plot developments that seem to have been pulled out of the air.<br />Plus, the movie is a massive contradiction. Cruise sees a \\"Pre-Cog\\" vision, showing Cruise killing a man( A MAN CRUISE HAS NEVER EVEN HEARD OF ) a few days in the future. I'm not going to give away any major plot points, but, the only way Cruise would be in a position to kill this person was because he saw the vision from the \\" Pre-Cog's\\". If they would not have had this vision, Cruise would never meet this person. And, if he would never meet this person- there would be no murder and therefore, there would be no vision. <BR>Again, like \\"The Fugitive\\", there is a conspiracy, and there is a frame-up. The reason for the framing of Cruise had absolutely nothing to do with the film's villian or the villian's crimes.<br />Steer clear of this film. After 2 1/2 hours, I felt as though I should have been paid to see this movie, instead of putting out my own money.
B000003TA4|5.0|I could tell so much about this album, but i Think everything has been said about it, it's one of the best albuns that exist and who doesn't think that must be stupid...anyway, if you want to hear real music, buy this...
B00005NWLO|5.0|you just might be the latest guest of honor on CSI.<br />From the beginning to the very end, this recording simply takes off.  About the only negative thing that I can say is that some of the transitions between songs are choppy, but that is hardly a factor at all.  <br />For anyone who has never heard Lynyrd Skynyrd before and wants an introduction, this would be it.  This concert features some of their best and the dynamics between the musicians is outstanding.  Check out &quot;Gimme Three Steps&quot;, &quot;T for Texas&quot; and the wild guitar of &quot;Freebird&quot; to see what I mean.  One of the lovliest ballads in rock, &quot;Simple Man&quot; is also on the CD version of this (I have the cassette).<br />There isn't a single track that is not worthy of inclusion in this recording.
B000002L99|5.0|My all time favourite album. For 12+ years now. Hey, i was a bit too young in 1986. I've listened to heaps of stuff but, 5150 still hits home to this day.<br />Cover art, is that for real? I'd like one for my backyard.<br />Dreams is what converted me.I just love it when hagar goes Whoo! in Why Can't this be love.<br />Just hope the band re-activates again to 'Rock' the world.
B00000099Y|5.0|Without a doubt, a masterpiece. Maynard's haunting and soothing vocals deliver a worthwhile message, and tool's musicianship can never be matched. The songs on the album retAIN a heavy sound, and Aenima shows that it is possible  to listen a 13 minute song, and love every second.<br />Positives:<BR>   carey is an amazing drummer and sounds like he soloing in every song, <BR> <BR>   a message of using ur third eye, questioning authority, and never stop searching for the truth<br />   bill hicks is in the album. he's a comic genius and every1 should listen to him
0446608955|5.0|I loved this book!... I thought for a girl my age this was the perfect book to take me away from the reality of boys and dating. It's nice to dream once in awhile. I love that I could love the characters; if I can't stand the characters then I won't enjoy the book. Even if the book wasn't completely possible it was a very enjoyable book that I could read about a thousand more times. I disagree with these reviews that say that this is just like another Harlequin romance novel because this book is so far from that. This book has class and sophistication. If you enjoy a sweet story of new and young love, read this book. I also recommend his other books (The Notebook, however, was my least favorite).
B00004U8H4|2.0|I got this movie for a friend for chirstmas and she loved the movie. Me on the other hand hated it. I really didn't understand the end of it.
0060512806|4.0|Stephenson always does his homework.  The WWII history that forms the central backdrop to this wide ranging story is clearly well researched (or it feels that way to the uninformed!).  I found that the story bogged down a bit in his extensively detailed back story to the point that I tried skipping sections.  Then I learned that I had to go back and re-read those parts as there were central story elements there.  I wish that he had edited some of his highly detailed descriptive language down a bit though.<br />His central premise of an internet currency backed by stolen gold and the idea of an off shore data haven were intriguing. The characters that support the story line are sufficiently well drawn that you care about them enough to keep reading.  I particularly enjoyed learning about the history of the early code breaking machines in WWII, and the people behind them.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|a total sabotage of the authors intent the only resembelence between this movie and the book is the stolen title.<BR>and maby some of the charictors.<BR>check out the 1960 version for a good idea!
B000075BFK|5.0|How can you even ask if this is any good??? Tupac is a lyrical genius and always will be until the day he dies!!! His songs have beat, great lyrics, and shines his intelligence for those that listen with open ears. Fabulous!!!
B00000DGUG|5.0|After nearly four years after the release of \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\", I am still infatuated and a junkie of this record. <br />Far better than any Alanis release out there, it's her masterpiece in my opinion. This album is rich in its sound, words, and so much more. Some people refer to this album as Alanis's personal flop. The reason being is that this one is so much deeper and autobiographical that it surpasses any album I've ever listened to by anyone. That's why it was disregarded after one hit song (\\"Thank U\\"). It was too much for radio, too odd for her \\"fans\\" from the \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" era, and too not-so-rock and not-so-pop for spinning at parties.<br />That's all fine and good, because this album is, in a way, a kept treasure. I can safely say those who haven't given this album a chance or debate on purchasing...you won't be sorry. To this day, I continue to fall into a daze listening to this album, and cheering on the Queen of Female Honesty for simply reading [a lot] of her diary. <br />Lastly, if I had to be stranded on an island with one CD...it would be this one. I think you would agree.
B0000542D2|5.0|the movie itself is obviously great, and the special features give an interesting look into the making of. but none of the beatles are involved in the special features, and most of them are boring. what would have been really great is if the beatles had been remembering what it was like for the special features, and a commentary with george, paul, and ringo taking about each thing. now THAT would have been REALLY great!
B00005RYKV|4.0|Take it for what it's worth !!! It's clean and explosive visual and aural action ! One cannot get confused or lost with the plot (not much of a twist to it but still suffices)...For those who liked La Femme Nikita (original 1990 French version) and Leon/The Professional will definitely find themselves hooked on this film from the lead actor to it's cinematic/somewhat classical score ! A friend of mine said the musical score did not fit this movie;he's wrong ! The soundtrack avoids making the stereotypical cliche of using cheap synthesized pulsating pop music...The score gives the film it's dramatic edge without getting campy.Actor/director Takeshi Kitano does a suave yet brutal portrayal as a yakuza leader from the \\"old school\\" who begins to clean house and claim territory from other rival mobs and gangsters.<br />On the dvd audio/video technical side, the video transfer is clean and the digital surround is mind-blowing ! Special off screen sound effects pan around the room convincingly and effectively.The bass produced by the explosions and weaponry used is simply an adrenalin induced experience...
B00006YXEK|5.0|i love george harrison, so naturally i wanted this cd. it was great! they songs are deep, meaningful, and fun to listen to. i loved \\"any road\\", especially because of the ukelele and the beat. \\"rising sun\\" is also wonderful, as are the rest of the tracks on the cd. definatley worth buying!
B00003CXAA|3.0|The Godfather movies are masterpieces...especially parts 1 and 2. However...what's with the price??? There is only ONE bonus disc (whoop de doo!) and lets just say the picture quality is not the best that it could be. Each movie sold seperately would be about twenty, so all three of these movies would add up to about sixty at the most. However, you can not buy each movie seperately, they make you buy all three at once! They're milking all of us for our money and most of us are falling for it.<br />It's such a crime that they think they can get away with scamming us.
0066214122|1.0|Save your money and just go see the movie, when it inevitably comes out.<br />&quot;Prey&quot; is nothing more than a script; It's a verbal storyboard with near-vacuous paragraphs substituing for subtitles.  I've become disillusioned with Michael Crichton's &quot;formula&quot; novels that may have an interesting plot but no development - style but no substance - and will probably not bother with another Crichton novel.  That's a real shame, given what he's contributed over the years.<br />&quot;Prey&quot; could have been a fascinating look at the 21st-century confluence of corporate greed, social relationships, biology, computing and nanomanufacturing technology.  Crichton had the potential to develop the characters and the imagery into an epic, with a mature plot line and dozens (if not hundreds) of intertwined subplots.  Instead, we get an awkward first-person rendition of mostly monosyllabic dialogue written to eighth graders - perfect for the movie studio, but terribly unfulfilling to the reader.  This book could have been a classic but instead, it won't even be a footnote. <br />In the kitchen of science fiction, this book qualifies as a rice cake:  bland and not very filling.
B000065V1V|4.0|I actually liked several of Bowie's albums from the nineties better than this  one. Heathen and Hours were both too... whiny. &quot;Oh, woe me life is so sad&quot;. &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot; and &quot;Earthling&quot; had a lot more life and melody.<br />There are some good songs on Heathen. The best of them  is only on the bonus disk of the Limited Edition CD though! <BR>For the life of me I can't figure out why they did not include &quot;Conversation Piece&quot; on the standard edition, it is one of my favorite Bowie songs, along with &quot;I Have Not Been to Oxford Town&quot; and &quot;Teenage Wildlife&quot;.
B00005QXDD|4.0|first of all, a lot of people have been comparing jack black and kyle gass to frank zappa. to which i say: frank zappa is not comparable to any artist alive; it'll be a long time before someone like him comes back.<br />tenacious d has some pretty good music on here. i don't like the fact that they cuss every three seconds; that wears off the effect after a while. and any [bad] songs on here (the road is tough), are counterbalanced by the hilarious skits (and who wrote that song? me, baby, ME!)<br />unfortunately, the lyrics are a little uninspired. it seems like every song on this album is about jack black and kyle gass. ah, well. we can't all be social critics like good ol' frank.<br />this cd is definitely worth burning. otherwise, i don't know that i'd buy it. i think that tenacious d will in time make better and more complex albums.
0553213105|5.0|This is the first novel of Jane Austen that I've read, and I began here because it is such an often quoted novel....and I wasn't disappointed. Granted, I am forty years old....most begin reading JA when they are girls, but I am happy to say that my advanced age did not spoil my enjoyment of the novel.<br />Jane Austen is a superb storyteller with a wonderful sense of humor and insight into the social conventions of her era and the timeless and often humorous relations between men and women.<br />By the time I finished the last page and saw Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy happily married, I sighed and then immediately picked up another Jane Austen novel to read....and intend to continue doing so until I've read all of her novels and hopefully the biography by Carol Shields.<br />Other reviewers will tell you more about the plot....I want to convey the enjoyment you will recieve by reading Jane Austen. Yes there are happy endings....but there is also a lively social satire, conveyed through dialogue and narration, and writing that is beautifully crafted into plots that keep you turning the pages. So start with Pride and Prejudice....and begin a life-long love affair with a great author.
0743424425|2.0|What a terrible book.  There was a lot of pointless, boring drivel in the book.  I was actually quite surprised that something so awful could have been written by Stephen King.  From October to May, the Torrance family has to take care of the Overlook hotel with no communication to the outside world.. except for Danny's 'shining'.  The idea behind the book is pretty good but the story is terrible.  It jumps from past to present without the reader even knowing that.  I was really disappointed when I read this book.
0140434135|5.0|Northanger Abbey is a lighthearted, sweet, satire....<br />This is only my second Jane Austen novel, I read Pride and Prejudice before this, and while NA doesn't have the substance of P&amp;P, it is no less entertaining.<br />The story deals with the familiar Austen themes of social mores and the pursuit of a suitable husband, but in this novel it receives a fun and lively treatment which will keep you turning the pages, by turns rooting for and laughing at Catherine, swooning over Henry, and cheering when Isabella gets her just desserts!<br />I maybe the only woman to read Jane Austen for the first time at the age of forty, but I can't wait to read everything else she's written.....I've already bought them all. She's that much fun!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I don't own the DVD, but I can only begin to imagine what joy it would bring if I did! I own the movie, but it's starting to get worn from me watching it so much. This movie contains the classic 'formula' that every good movie EVER has had. The story, so simple at it's heart, is so heart wrenchingly beautiful because of it's simplicity. however, I've found that this movie is a hit or miss: You loathe it or you love it uncondionally. However, studies have shown that opened minded and creative people liked Moulin Rouge! better than the close minded and practical people! lol, so do yourself a favor and see this movie. You will laugh. You will cry. You will love it. <BR>&quot;the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return&quot;
B000002MUW|5.0|With a candy, sexy, delicious Madonna on the cover is her follow up album to the so-so effort of Erotica. With its R&B grooves it makes it one of the more listenable albums than before. On this album she worked with hotshot producers Dallas Austin (TLC, Pink), Dave \\"Jam\\" Hall (Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige), Babyface (Boyz II Men, TLC) and Nellee Hooper (Björk, Soul II Soul). Also a number one album in Australia (which was probably the only place it got there). Here is a review track by track:<br />1. Survival (Madonna/Dallas Austin) 10/10<BR>This is almost too good to be true. A beginning track you can actually stand listening to. It has a light-hearted message about being in the public eye and saying that she will not regret anything she has done over her years in the spotlight. With a good funky beat it gets full marks.<br />2. Secret (Madonna/Dallas Austin) 9.5/10<BR>Mmmmmm...the first single taken off the album is one not forgotten by many and told us that \\"Happiness lies in our own hands\\" ;) ;). As we can see here she took a turn in direction from the dance-orientated \\"Erotica\\" and put her energy into R&B and made it sound better than her other work.<br />3. I'd Rather be Your Lover (Madonna/Dave Hall/Isley Brothers/ C. Jasper) 10/10<BR>Going further into R&B, this track makes it a highlight of the album with its funky melody and bass and raps done by label mate, Me'Shell Ndegeócello. Her voice is so good in this song it sounds like a black artist has sung it. The song is about someone whod rather be in love with them than anything else.<br />4. Don't Stop (Madonna/Dallas Austin/Colin Wolfe) 7/10<BR>A nice little positive dance-ditty with nice lyrics and a message only about dont stop dancing with me. This song was a replacement for playing \\"Bedtime Story\\" on the radio. The only flaw about this song is the line \\"sing la de da di\\" which gets pretty annoying after it repeats it about five times.<br />5. Inside Of Me (Madonna/Dave Hall/Nellee Hooper) 10/10<br />Very sexy and vogue, this song is like a wet dream and takes samples off 5 or so other songs including the late Aaliyah's breakthrough 1994 hit \\"Back & Forth\\". You can't get any more sexy than this and its worth a try to make love to this song ;)<br />6. Human Nature (Madonna/Dave Hall/S. McKenzie/K. McKenzie/M. Deering) 7/10<BR>A turn in the positive attitude of this CD so far comes into a nasty slap in the face for the critics of \\"Sex\\" book and \\"Erotica\\" album. She claims that it is only human nature (to do what? Get paid millions of dollars to make a pornographic book and a half hearted dance album?). It has a good melody though and is a track not to be skipped.<br />7. Forbidden Love (Babyface/Madonna) 8/10<BR>A ballad (the first one on here produced by Babyface) that soars pretty well and has a calm melody and is about, well, forbidden love. Not much more to say.<br />8. Love Tried To Welcome Me (Madonna/Dave Hall) 8/10<BR>A rather sombre ballad about not being able to fall in love again and shows that she has matured a bit more since her other albums.<br />9. Sanctuary (Madonna/Dallas Austin/Anne Preven/Scott Cutler/Herbie Hancock) 9/10 <BR>A moody number that is pretty wispy and scary. It has mad effects in it and is pretty good. The Enigma-like effects in this song are one of the main highlights. This goes right into...<br />10. Bedtime Story (Björk/Nellee Hooper) 0.5/10<BR>BLAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! YUCK!!! I HATE THIS SONG!!! This album would have been improved if it emitted this song. Written by Icelandic alt-superstar Björk it is the only song that doesn't fit into the R&B mould. It is very abstract and is a kind of window into the future. The worst mistake ever was releasing this single in the US. It only peaked at 42 for one week then falling like a brick to 52. Contrary to my opinion, you might like this song, but it wasn't a very wise career move after the no. 1 success of \\"Take A Bow\\". The moaning in the beginning of the song are nothing less than annoying.<br />10. Take A Bow (Madonna/Babyface) 10/10<BR>Ahhhhhhh! how refreshing after the ...[crud] of that last track Madonna closes this album with a soothing, beautiful ballad produced by Babyface again. This has been her most successful US hit so far reaching #1 and staying there for seven consecutive weeks, contrary to the UK where it was her least successful hit peaking at 16. The video was filmed in Spain and showed us what Evita was coming from. Bliss.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|I read the reviews of this DVD but purchased it anyway.  A big mistake.  Stick to the VHS version.  The colors in the DVD are atrocious.  I am so disappointed in Disney for not releasing the only animated film ever to be nominated for a best picture Oscar in the best possible format.  The public deserves an apology for getting our hopes up.
B000002N3J|5.0|Back in 1995 we were expecting another Madonna album, but more to our surprise we get a collection of her finest ballads. It went so well in Australia debuting at number one and shifting quadruple-platinum status. This is one of the few CDs that I can play start to finish without having to skip anything. Since only a few ballads Madonna has recorded she had to go to work with David Foster and record some new ones. \\"You'll See\\" is the part II version of \\"Take A Bow\\" and fits in nicely together. Also \\"One More Chance\\" is a nice acoustic ballad with only guitar, voice and violins and fits in good aswell. So does the Massive Attack collaboration \\"I Want You\\", a cover of the Marvin Gaye classic in two versions (A more electronic version and an orchestral one). If you haven't got this CD in your Madonna collection, I would advise you to get it as it is a valuable part of the catalog.
B00006JU7T|4.0|Al Pacino became a star thanks to his role as Michael Corleone in The Godfather.  The film that cemented Mr. Pacino as one of the best actors of his generation was Serpico.  Based on the Peter Maas book of the same name, Serpico is the true story of a New York undercover cop who seems to be the only honest cop on the force. Due to his honest nature, the other cops are leery of him and refuse to accept him as a real cop.  To that end, he moves from precinct to precinct in search of a friendly work environment, but wherever he goes, he finds the same old situation.  Serpico then goes to the higher-ups in the department, but they too have no use for his accusations.  Finally, he goes public with his accusations and that triggers an investigation into the dealings of police officers.  Serpico becomes a marked man and is nearly intentionally killed by another cop who while Serpico is on an undercover operation.  Mr. Pacino brings a realistic approach to the role and you feel sympathy for Serpico.  He is not a great man, he has his faults, but he believes in what he does and he takes a stand for his belief that policeman should serve the public and not illegally benefit from their position of power.
B00005JLRR|2.0|Moronic.  That about sums it up.  But it would be unfair to fellow Star Trek fans to leave it at that.  The one positive thing I can say about Nemesis is that the villain reminded me of Dr. Evil.  That at least gave me a reason to crack a smile.<br />Make no mistake.  This is the worst of the Star Trek movies.  (I am well aware of just how bad Star Trek V was.  But at least it had decent special effects.) The main problem is a bad story.  Not too many ways around that, unfortunately.  Not even Patrick Stewart's wonderful way with a phrase can dig him out of this silly story line and just plain bad dialogue.  This is the kind of script that would get you laughed out of any screenwriting competition.<br />Now, the \\"idea\\" behind Nemesis could provide nice fodder for a decent storyteller.  Indeed, the movie's timing couldn't have been better with the core plot device resonating in the headlines.  Without giving away details, it's a story of a clone, but with not a shred of originality, coherence, and provocativeness about it.  In the right hands, it could have been turned into a fascinating study on the Manchurian Candidate, or a wrenching moral drama about human identity and the issues raised by genetic tinkering.  But no.  This is a story that probably was written by a sixth grader.  And not a smart one.<br />Indeed, even retaining the basic plot structure, it is possible that a good writer might have made this at least into a compelling drama--the rise of a young Reman slave, the intrigue of a rebellion within the shadowed hallways of Romulus, the conflict borne when a Federation captain cannot bear to betray his duplicate.  But, it's all wishful thinking from a Star Trek fan who has just watched butcherous slobs hack a long-running saga to pathetic ribbons.  (If I could include an audio clip here, it would be the sound of a thousand rhesus monkeys wailing.)<br />Aside from sending the writers and producers to a penal colony in a distant galaxy, it's also time to retire the crew.  Will Riker, looking as plump as James Doohan in his final outings, appears to be morphing into Burl Ives.  Troy looks almost as decrepit.  Data?  Let's just say that he's been reduced to bad singing and bad jokes, but fortunately he finds a decent cure.  Worf?  He's marginalized and emasculated.  If he were  a real Klingon, his brother would have hunted him down and put him out of his misery.  Of the entire lot, only Picard acquits himself passably.  And we're forced to suffer cameos by the equally insufferable Guinan and \\"Admiral\\" Janeway.<br />Am I urging you not to see this?  Absolutely.  Go rent First Contact, or even Insurrection.  Or better yet, grab a few DVDs of the ORIGINAL Star Trek, when they had great writers and great stories.  With this kind of tripe, I'm sure Gene Roddenberry is spinning in his grave.  Let's not make it any worse for him by lining the pockets of the greedy and untalented thieves who coopted the Star Trek franchise and turned it into moron-ville.<br />Finally, the special effects and editing are poor, too.  Everything gets foggy and disjointed where it shouldn't to cover for a lack of technological skill and attention to detail.  This is short-cut and cheapskate stuff, ladies and gentlemen.  And even the aliens are cardboard cut-outs.  Ugh.

B00005QCVY|5.0|&quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; has become one of those works of art that unfortunately suffers from over exposure. Because everyone and their dog has seen the film eight trillion times (and usually in pathetically rendered public domain prints- more on that later,too many people take this beautiful film for granted.<br />Suprisingly dark, and hard hitting, Capra as a director pulls very few punches with this, his greatest work. Many have critisized the film as cliched and over sentimental. Maybe that's true, but this film earns all the real emotions it conjures in the audience's eyes. It populates its narrative with animals of all stripes. The irredeemable Mr. Potter is such an example.<br />Everyone, male and female, adult and child alike, needs to find the beauty in the everyday experience and in the truth that our lives entertwine with all those around us. We cannot expect life to ever be perfect. We often sacrifice our dreams and hopes frequently to the better of those around us. &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; stands as a testiment to man's determination to find his/her place in the world. This film is a sterling example of how, no matter how much we would like to fool ourselves into believing the opposite, we are all part of a larger soul, a soul that belongs to everyone (aplogies to John Steinbeck).<br />Capra's characters are filled with rage, lust, doubt, sadness, temptation. He also fills them with temperance, love, forgiveness and faith. Every character in this film is fully three drawn and complex.<br />Perhaps no character more so than Jimmy Stewart's everyman, George Bailey. Simply put, George Bailey is one of the all time greatest performances ever put on film. George's complete and utter evololution from gangly teenager to redeemed adult and everything in between stands as a perfect example of film acting. Stewart's performance is as well rounded, shaded and empathetic as anything Brando ever did. Stewart literally opens himself up with a straighrazor in this film and gives his audience complete and full access to his (and therefore, our) very soul(s). Stewart proves with this film, that he was America's consumate leading man (Denzel Washington has perhaps come the closest to taking his place).<br />The cinematography radiates in vivid detail throughout this gloriously remastered DVD. For all of those who have strained to watch this film through the scratches and poor contrast over the years, this DVD is one of the great Christmas presents. The silver, black and white photography looks as if Ansel Adams himself had decided to chuck the Southwest in favor of switching places with Norman Rockwell. Capra's sense of framing really shines throughout.<br />Along with &quot;American Beauty&quot; (the subtle, but present similarities are astounding!)&quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; stands as one of the most beautiful portrayals of Human life. It remains as fresh the 100th viewing as it does the first. A true proof of a work of art.
B00007BH5C|5.0|We loved the soundtrack of The Fellowship (especially the hobbit parts!), and play it over and over.  We will be doing the same with this one, except for the last one, Gollum's song.  We were very disappointed in it, we thought it would be the song about fish that appears in the book.  After the first time, we skip that one.
0767817478|1.0|A noisy confused mess of picture. Nobody can act, the special effects are lazy at best(the beast seems to be able to change size at will) and the story seems to be some half assed viet-nam allegory: A French problem that will overrun the earth unless they can somehow get the beast into the open where the air force can destroy it.<BR>Yes it's just a Monster movie but Monster moives have rules as rigid as those of grand opera, if you voilate them you'd better have a reason. This film doesn't. For example:<BR>1. Monsters must be big and fierce (the Jaws rule)<BR>I don't know who designed the creature in this film but the big dumb lower jaw makes it look like it's deformed. Add that it eats fish like a cat out of a bowl and spends a lot of time running away and hiding and you tend to undercut the menace of the creature.<BR>2. Obnxious people must be killed (the Jurassic Park rule).<BR>It's part of the guilty pleasures of monster movies that creeps get killed in horrible ways. Didn't happen here. You wait and wait and no. Nothing.<BR>3. The Monster is the star (the King Kong Rule)<BR>We spend far to much time seeing the stupid romance between Mr. Broderick (who is awful) and the female lead (who is worse). who cares. <BR>A final note - if you are going to rip of a film sequence like this moive did with the baby Godzillas don't rip off a film that everybody already saw the year before (Jurassic Park II) (the odessa steps rule)<BR>The film fails because of it's contempt for the viewer. Just a crass attempt to make money off of stupid monster movie fans. Judging by the contempt this film has generated from the fans (sony had to shut down the chat room for this picture) and that there will be no sequel ever, it may be the fans were smarter then they thought.
6305508550|5.0|Office Space is one of the best comedy films of all time. It's one of those films you'll go back to watch certain parts (or the whole thing) over and over again. The movie captures many of the comic nuances of working in the business world (bosses that don't really do anything, disdain for office equipment, ridiculous coworkers, and most importantly, promotion through neglecting responsibilities). The character of Lawrence adds countless additional laughs with his down to earth, simplistic views on the world. And, of course, Jennifer Aniston fits in perfectly, adding beauty and humor. In short, it's good.
B00005JKG7|4.0|This movie is one of John Carpenter's best.  Without much ado, without much character development we are propelled straight into the guts of the plot and for the next 90 minutes it's mainly action, action, and a few chills.  I have lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie but it still makes me jump (one particular place every time)!<br />Anyways, 90 minutes.  Yes many moons ago directors and producers had a better idea of editing than they do now.  Seems that all movies have become self important and no one wants to leave anything on the cutting room floor.  If you are such a director or producer watch The Fog and understand why good editing HELPS the movie...if there's film on the cutting room floor chances are it was meant to be on the floor.<br />DVD.  Great quality.  Nicely cleaned up image, good sound, good features.  This is a prime example of how old movies should be released.<br />Hairstyles...bad.<BR>Ms Curtis...as always, no complaint.
0380733358|5.0|This book is not only great as far as espionage is concerned but it also takes you back to the days of England in 1940s and its beautiful landscape, country roads, and towns... Interestingly romance has found a part of its own in this novel and adds greatly to the flavor. It is certainly one of the best espionage thrillers ever.

B000068FXR|5.0|&quot;Crisis? What Crisis? is the second in a line of four, what I call, masterpieces from Supertramp. It's a work dominated by Roger Hodgson, who does vocals on seven of the ten songs. <br />The remaster is crisp and clean, with songs such as &quot;Sister Moonshine,&quot; and &quot;The Meaning&quot; ringing sweet out to my ears.<br />But what I want to mention is that this package finally contains the long lost lyrics to the album.  In the past releases I owned, they were never included.  I had to go out and find the actual &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; song book to get them.  And to all you Supertramp fans out there....the lyrics on this remaster contain many mistakes. &quot;A Soapbox Opera&quot; was always hard to figure out, and the key lyric at the bridge is wrong. (The correct lyric is &quot;But rather than a reason, there's a smog in my head&quot;) So all you Supertramp fans take note!
B00005YW4H|5.0|The first time I heard &quot;Don't Know Why,&quot; I was mesmerized.  The more I heard the song on the radio, the more I just had to get the CD.  Finally, I received this wonderful gift for Christmas.  I play it all day at work and all night at home.  Her voice is very smooth and the music just flows.  This is not a CD that will get you depressed, as another reviewer mentions.  Norah Jones' music just gets you inspired.  One of the best gifts I ever received.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I can't understand why some TNG purists trash DS9.<br />The multiseason arced storylines are brilliant, and much better than anything that TNG ever attempted. One would hope that \\"Enterprise\\" will eventually be capable of the same.<br />The Dominion War arc was brilliant, consisting of mulitple mini-arcs. Trek historical references were also good, with the Tribble episode, and my personal favorite, the Alternate Universe (Spock with a beard) episodes.
0316666343|2.0|I certainly won't forget this book, parts of it.  But it won't be one of my favorites.  That wouldn't keep me from recommending it.  Heavens!  Everyone to his or her own choosing, is my thought!<br />But I got a bit tired of the heavenly circumstances and the fact that nothing would really be resolved.  And having read the blurb from respected writer Anna Quindlen on the back cover, comparing this book to To Kill A Mockingbird, just makes me wonder who was paying her to write the blurb.<br />The tragedy of this girl's death, horrible murder and rape and slaughter, and the continued life of her serial murderer is sickening.  Justice played out by nature is good, even humorous; unexpected, yet predictable.<br />I know this is a best seller, a runaway best seller, but I am glad I did not rush out to get it.  I would have been disappointed.  Am I glad I read it?  Of course!  I don't want someone else to make up my mind for me.<br />Would I recommend it?  Not without reservation.

0312305060|2.0|In a word: vacuous.<br /><br />Content: Does Cunningham add anything to the plot of \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" except for reflexive criticisms of traditional lifestyles? This novel is like a bad cover version. And, to paraphrase Elmore Leonard, Cunningham seems to specialize in writing the type of passages which people \\"skip over.\\"<br /><br />Style: Cunningham is a blandly elegant writer. He makes the serious mistake of quoting passages from \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" Now, I am not convinced Woolf's writing is always completely successful, but she is undoubtedly highly original and thoughtful in her prose style and is brimming with things to say. The contrast was seriously damaging to Cunningham.<br /><br />That this novel won the Pulitzer Prize shows that the prize has become an entirely pr-driven affair. I actually picked up the book because I wanted to read it prior to seeing the movie with Meryl Streep. Now, I'm not planning on seeing the movie anymore.
1587990717|2.0|I'm very much of two minds about this book. There's little need to offer further comment on:<br />1. The author's ego (in one paragraph on page 59, he uses the perpendicular pronoun 7 times; the possessive first person another 5); or his hyperbolistic writing style: this might be too easily dismissed as an ad hominem attack.<br />2. The many glaring contradictions in this book: they appear so often (sometimes in the next sentence), they can hardly be viewed as a random event: this would take too long, and any intelligent reader can spot them. <br />3. The superfluous material: with so much impertinent opinion found between the covers, this would take too much effort.<br />4. The missed opportunities: another author can capitalize on this.<br />5. The delicious irony between the thesis and the content: this is for the discerning reader to perceive and enjoy.<br />If people wanted to be as nasty as Taleb is in dismissing those he disagrees with, they could use a subject line like \\"Clearly, not a Swan Song,\\" or \\"A Highly Masturbatory Essay\\" or \\"This book is as fat as the argument is thin\\". <br />While there is much to complain about in this nauseatingly self-centered book, so filled with noise and so little signal (seriously estimated at 85:15), such comments would miss the point: this is actually a highly original work and is certainly thought-provoking. Although I give it only 2 stars, it's still worth reading, if only to argue against. A three-paragraph summary of his 200 pages follows: <br />1. Thesis: Today's virtual world measures success without sufficiently discerning luck from skill. Intelligence alone is deemed the necessary condition for wealth. <br />2. Antithesis: Too much of what is widely held to be worldly success should actually be attributed to luck; i.e., results hidden inside the vicissitudes of random variation. This \\"common sense\\" approach is naïve because it fails to establish the link between cause and effect and ignores the effect of variation, which, in one of its tails, can produce extraordinary results. Taleb explores the problem of induction and confronts the non-linearity of regret.<br />3. Synthesis: The trick is, of course, to determine post facto, what was random and what was skill, and more critically, to assess the nature of risk going into a decision. Mistakes in these areas can be extremely costly. Beware of the tails, especially if they are fat. If you want to be probabilistic, don't bet more than you can happily afford to lose. Question everything. Be humble. Accept adversity with good grace.<br />This is an interesting thesis; too bad Taleb doesn't focus on examining the evidence instead of talking about himself and offering unsupported opinions. He dabbles with epistemology, but equivocates on whether knowledge is arrived at by rational or empirical means. Despite frequent and inappropriate abuse of the word \\"clearly,\\" he doesn't clarify the ontological considerations that lie at the heart of this book: sufficient cause and non-contradiction. Though he's personally fond of the Monte Carlo technique, many of us could be spared much of that bother by answering a few simple questions:<br />1. What is the worst-case scenario?<BR>2. What is the best-case scenario?<BR>3. What is the most likely scenario?<BR>4. How confident am I in the assessments?<BR>5. What can I afford to lose?<br />The author raises the work of Kahneman and Tversky, but hardly surveys it; the work of other key economic thinkers is ignored: Thaler and Arrow come to mind immediately; many others should appear but do not. No wonder Japanese librarians classify this work as literature: it's little more than an essay, largely devoid of footnotes or a meaningful bibliography. <br />Being unlettered in mathematical sciences, I ought to be cautious about questioning his math, as simple as it is, but must nonetheless question both Taleb's assumptions and his logic in the few examples he provides. He rails against \\"pseudo-science\\" but dabbles happily in many disciplines in which he lacks formal qualifications, jumping from lily-pad to lily-pad, seemingly unaware that his dilettantism is evident to even the fellow layperson. Despite his professed aversion for \\"borrowed wisdom,\\" it abounds in this tome. Taleb's editor took a vacation, especially towards the end of the book, where there are many errors of punctuation. <br />Incidentally, in one of many delicious ironies of this book, Taleb uses the very Hegelian logic he rails against to make his point. It would be interesting to see John Horgan (he of The End of Science fame) interview Taleb. The ultimate irony is that Taleb has actually co-written a concise account of his thesis in 26 pages at his own web page.<br />Intriguingly, in some of the interviews also linked to his web page, he comes across as being lucid and pithy, and also a polished and gracious reviewer. Some of his other writings show a keen insight into human and abstract sensibilities. Sadly, the same cannot be said of this book, which appears to be more a transcript of a session with his psychoanalyst. This is an opportunity lost. A severe edit of this book could likely bring it up to the level (5 stars) for which it has the potential. But it's nowhere near there, yet.

B00006F7S4|2.0|For starters get Marianne Faithfull's new album &quot;Kissin Time&quot;. Beck produced &amp; co-wrote some of the tracks. Everything from the album cover on up is very similar to Sea Change and I really do believe THAT was the kind of album he was trying to make.<BR>    <BR>There are only three tracks here that really stand out...those would be &quot;The Golden Age&quot; &quot;Lost Cause&quot; and &quot;Sunday Sun&quot;. I work at a record store so i've had the opportunity to scan through all the music magazines...where all these good reviews are coming from I don't really know. The cd..the SONGS are pretty but that doesn't always mean they're good. I've listened too all of Beck's previous studio albums...and this is the worst!
B000023VR6|5.0|This album is one of the greatest in a loooong time, I bought this when it first came out and TO THIS DAY it's still a banger.

0151008116|5.0|This is a truly fascinating novel--one of the best I've read in a long time. If you're not a religious person, don't be turned off by the claims that the novel &quot;will make you believe in God.&quot; This is not, as I initially feared, a book about religion. If anything, it suggests a rather unusual and unorthodox reason to believe in God (it's the &quot;better story&quot;). The adventures of the protagonist occupy most of the book. In fact, half-way through you'll wonder if this is just a very well-written book of adventures. It's not. Keep reading to see how much farther than the obvious the novel goes. You'll find yourself grinning with delight. The book really has it all--a great story, fascinating characters, much food for thought, and superb writing. If you love fiction and literature, you must read this book.

B00000AD94|2.0|The Light was Spock's Beard's debut album, and it shows, as it feels rough and unfinished, and at times perhaps misconceived.  The arrangements are herky-jerky, the lyrics ranging from confusing to embarrassing, and the sound is often thin, quite a change from the fuller sounds we're used to from their recent albums.<br />The title track opens the album and displays all of these qualities in spades.  It starts with a cloying piano melody and then launches into an overture-like, uninspired instrumental sequence, before finally hitting the mark with the quirky but melodic &quot;One Man&quot; bit.  From there the track winds through several vaguely-connected melodies before returning to the &quot;One Man&quot; melodies and finally wrapping up with the unfortunate piano-and-vocals bit again.  The lyrics don't hold water at all, and the transitions between parts of the track feel very rough and unsatisfying.<br />&quot;Go the Way You Go&quot; and &quot;The Water&quot; are both similar in approach and outcome.  &quot;Go&quot; is the best of the three since it has the strongest melodies; &quot;The Water&quot; has some interesting bits, but is overall the weakest track of the album, and is not cube-friendly thanks to its extensive use of a four-letter word.  Lyrically, little here is of interest, as Neal Morse's tendency for portentiousness has not been reined in by his later facility to make a point.<br />&quot;On the Edge&quot; is a straightforward rocker, a little reminiscent of Peter Gabriel's &quot;On the Air&quot;.  It's the tightest track of the album, and is what it is.<br />The sound, as I said, often feels thin.  I'm not a big fan of Alan Morse's guitar work generally, but he was clearly still mastering his craft on this album.  Neal Morse's keyboards are decent, but the absence of Ryo Okumoto really shows; his arrival would give later albums a much deeper, more satisfying sound.<br />All in all, The Light is of only marginal interest to folks who aren't already big fans of Spock's Beard.  There's some good material here, enjoyable when you can unearth it, but the album is really only a template for much better work yet to come.ig fans of Spock's Beard.

0385474547|5.0|Having been translated into all the major languages, \\"Things Fall Apart\\" commands an attentive audience world-wide. It is a superlative novel whose literary dynamics seem perpetual.<BR>Brimming with intrigue and suspense, it has remained Professor Achebe's most famous work; and many experts would not hesitate to call it his best.
B000002KDS|4.0|Alice Cooper has the reputation on being a scary rock star. Well this album proves it. He along with his band created scary songs such as \\"Dead Babies\\", and \\"Killer\\". He also made great hard rock songs such as \\"Under My Wheels\\", \\"and \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\". The album in general is a mix of scary, evil and hard rock rock sounds that make this album great. Buy the album if you like Alice Cooper.
B00005NWM3|1.0|First off I'd like to ask a question. What in the blue hell is a band like this doing on Roadrunner Records?  Roadrunner is home to such bands as Misfits, Slipknot, Obituary, Soulfly...does this sound like a label that should carry a horrible Creed/Live want-to-be band?

B00006SFLV|3.0|I'm not going to review the original series; the series was great. I was very disappointed with this DVD release. The picture quality is not what I have come to expect from DVD. It looks like digital cable. Possibly it has been overcompressed to fit four episodes on each DVD disc; I'd rather have more discs. It is poor. The most annoying thing is the soundtrack mixing. If you play it loud enough to hear the dialog, the background music is overbearing. If you set the volume so the background music level is comfortable, then the music drowns out the dialog so you can't understand what is being said. Much more care should have been taken in transfering the greatest TV show of all time to DVD. The original series gets 5 stars, but this DVD release only gets 3.
B00000JPH4|3.0|This movie was a favorite of mine growing up in the early 80's, although I must admit that some parts were very, very creepy to me at a young age ( as the other reviewer mentions himself. ) An old creature that hisses and then crumbles after dying isn't exactly Muppet Show mentality.<br />But then that's how the movie is good, in a certain way. Jim Henson and Frank Oz took a chance and tried something new, creating puppets and landscapes in a dark fantasy movie that recalls both Lord of the Rings and Star Wars in its plot and characters.<br />I have to say that after over twenty years, the movie holds up very well, overall. While some of the bluescreen work is a little iffy, the remastered DVD makes things look better. The puppets are, for the most part, very life-like ( conceptualized by Brian Froud, who would later work with Henson and Oz on Labyrinth ), and the sleight of hand tricks and camera moves ( check out the puppet>human actor>puppet seamless edits ) to disguise the fact that someone's hand was up the characters' asses was quite slick. Some of the best I've seen. Also, Trevor Jones' music score is inviting and epic, and as a DVD feature, can be heard as an isolated track. <br />While The Dark Crystal may be a little *too* dark for anyone under the age of 4, anyone older should be amazed and satisfied by one of the 80's most magical and timeless movies.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Of course, the books are always better, but if I were you, I would read the book first and then  buy the movie and watch it. This movie is good, you should buy it soon (if you don't have it yet).
B00005JKG9|5.0|Jack Lemmon, one of the screen's great actors, gives a startling performance as Sheldon Levine, a once-great salesman now gone to seed and plagued with desperation over losing his job in David Mamet's \\"Glengarry Glen Ross.\\" Lemmon's work really makes the movie, though the cast of stars (Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce) is uniformly excellent. And, through Mamet's screenplay, each is given an opportunity to have at least one powerhouse scene, particularly Baldwin, who appears only in the beginning 10 minutes of the film.<br />With a cast that talented, it's good that they're all given moments to shine.<br />The plot of the film is beside the point, really. Much of the \\"action\\" that drives the plot, including the pivotal robbery of the office, occurs off-screen. (This is done so that the plot can function as a whodunit - but also because the film focuses more on how these men, when their masculinity is challenged through threats to their jobs, react in violent outbursts to one another.)<br />The DVD offers up two discs, featuring both a fullscreen and a widescreen presentation of director James Foley's film. Features also include a tribute to Lemmon and a commentary track by Foley.<br />If you like dialogue-driven drama that's usually reserved for the stage, this film is a must-see.
B00000099Y|5.0|i really didnt listen to metal/prog rock before i listened to this album. i listened mostly to pearl jam, nirvana, alice in chains, soundgarden... but my friend had aenima and i borrowed it, and i thought it was ok at first. but this is one of those great albums that grows on you - not like nevermind or ten or dirt that are great out of the case.  but this album is better than nevemind and ten. its truly beautiful - i dont know how they keep you listening to those 11 - 13 minute songs the whole time, but  i have reapeatedly been able to just sit and listen to the cd  without getting bored. the songs constantly go from quiet parts, to explosions of sound, with furious yelling and pounding drums and blurring guitars, back to a singe quiet melody. its simply amazing. i cant say anything bad about it. but only buy it if you like good music, or are willing to try somethig new. this music is way beyond people who listen to britney spears and all that.

0375414053|5.0|As a new working mother, I gobbled this book up ferociously, it was an incredible read and spoke to me in a way that no one has yet.  The troubles with balance, wrestling with guilt, all of the struggles inherent in trying to manage a career and a home are addressed in this witty and insightful novel.  I had hoped that, after reading this, I would have a better idea of how to try to make life work with the multitude of roles I now have, but alas it doesn't as you'll see (I won't spoil the ending).  There is no one best answer for career-driven mothers and the myth of the \\"superwoman\\" is just that.  It is impossible to be the best worker and the best mom, you can only do the best you can, which oftentimes feels woefully inadequate.  My problem now is that I don't know who to lend this to next because all of my friends who work don't have kids and all of my mother friends don't work.  So I think I'll hang on to it and read it again.  Is there anyone out there who is a working mom?  We need to stick together.
B00004X01U|4.0|Great album! Madonna shows again her beauty again-<br />not only in her outward appearance! She is<br />still one of the queens of pop and gives us<br />an exciting example how different music<br />influences work on the same album.<br />&quot;Music&quot; is one of the singles and is able to<br />rock the dancefloors with an electrobeat.<br />&quot;What it feels like for a girl&quot; is the best<br />single from this album which shows how<br />sensible (surely not only...) girls can be<br />and how far emotional things can go and<br />follow you. The song after this is &quot;Paradise&quot;<br />which shows that the love that you search<br />cannot always be given as you wish it from<br />the bottom of your heart (&quot;...your paradise<br />was not for me!&quot;). &quot;Nobody is perfect&quot; is a great<br />song too which underlines the feeling of unhappy<br />love and how you can break under someone's expectations<br />against you to be an ideal. &quot;American Pie&quot; is a single<br />which was covered by a classic. The other songs on<br />this album are nearly all good. It is a mixture<br />of dreaming sounds, ballads and dancefloor.<br />Buy it!
B000002KD9|5.0|There is merely great music and then there are those songs and albums that take you back to a period in your life that was both magical and scary. For me, After The Gold Rush is one of those albums.<BR>Back in San Diego, a lot of the neighborhood kids hung around at my friend Howard Pierce's garage partying and listening to good music day in and day out. Howard's garage was a place of friendship, it was a place of refuge, it was a place to sort out our insecurities and for many of the kids, it was a place we got to know our first loves. Our musical tastes were varied but After The Gold Rush is one of several albums everyone could agree on and while it was playing, it helped bind us ever deeper in friendship.<BR>Yes, Neil Young's vocal range is limited, and the songs sometimes maudlin, but his whiny voice and earnest vulnerability have an endearing quality about them that makes this CD a perfect listening choice when gathered with close friends or a lover. And the fact that it is #2 on amazon's Ohio State University music circle thirty-two years after its issue says something about its timeless appeal to those young in body and spirit.<BR>My favorite's are Oh Lonesome Me, Don't Let It Bring You Down, When You Dance You Can Really Love, and I Believe In You. Southern Man is a great rocker and is one of Young's most famous songs, but its sanctimony turned me off even when I was young. Did Young mean to tell us that the only racists around were in the South? The song did allow millions of kids to feel superior to Southern rednecks who most of us were sure were just like those hillbillies in Deliverance or the warden in Cool Hand Luke. The ironic thing is that in my neighborhood half of the kids were the sons and daughters of Southerners who came west to work after WWII.<BR>I have many Neil Young recordings, but if I had to choose just one to keep, that one would be After The Gold Rush. Its transgenerational appeal makes it the one to own.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I discover punk-rock with this masterpiece! This album is so awesome, and it remember a lot of great times! ESSENTIAL!
B00000AOUD|5.0|I just submitted a review of _Stand Up_. As long as I'm reviewing old Tull albums, I might as well hit one or two of my other old favorites.<br /><br />I mentioned some time ago in a review of Cat Stevens's _Foreigner_ that my initial responses to these two albums were about the same: \\"Well, this is interesting, I guess.\\" The difference is that _Thick as a Brick_ grew on me and _Foreigner_ didn't. Cat Stevens had two or three genuinely great albums, but _Foreigner_ wasn't one of them; Tull has had at least ten genuinely great albums, and TaaB _is_ one of them.<br /><br />See, at the time, Pink Floyd, Yes and ELP and everybody else were cranking out long prog-rock albums. A few of these were excellent, but lots of them were just bandwagon-hopping; Stevens's overblown and tiresome _Foreigner_ was a shining example of the latter. But Ian Anderson had something else in mind with this one.<br /><br />I guess it wasn't obvious to everybody in the album's initial audience, but Anderson was in fact indulging in serious parody here. The music on this album-length song is just terrific. But the somewhere-between-surreal-and-absurd lyrical sensibilities owe a good deal more to Monty Python than to any of the other prog-rock bands topping the charts with their ponderous mythopoetic pseudoprofundities.<br /><br />It should have been clear from the newspaper parody that accompanied the original release (reproduced here at microminiature \\"eyestrain\\" size, so don't count on being able to read it easily). Does anybody else remember National Lampoon's Sunday newspaper parody (the \\"Dacron Republican-Democrat\\")? The St. Cleve Chronicle (written by the band members) is along those lines, but with more of a Lewis Carroll/Edward Lear edge. At any rate -- no, kids, there isn't any \\"Gerald Bostock,\\" and it shouldn't have taken us very long to figure out that Ian was having us on a bit. And to our credit, most of us twigged before the rock critics did; some of them were even _thicker_ than bricks.<br /><br />This remastered CD is nicely done. It includes the full original LP, of course, and you _don't_ have to flip it over to get to Side Two the way we used to have to do with the vinyl one. It also includes long excerpts from interviews with Ian Anderson, Jeffrey Hammond, and Martin Barre, and a shortened live version of the song itself. The sound quality is excellent throughout.nicely done.

B00003CXAT|4.0|When an ambitious but fragile capitalist decided to lease an island off the coast of Costa Rica and build an animal park there, he was totally blind of the consequences.........at least considering the type of animals he was to rear and exhibit. When the island park of dinosaurs was almost finished, he decided to invite a small group of scientists to inspect and endorse the park so that the investors' lawyer could give permittion to continue its construction. With all the security features in place, the group would not be ready for the terror that awaits them. An important worker in the park has made a previous illegal agreement with another company to smuggle some dinosaur embryos out of the island and he will accomplish it at all costs.........even if it means shutting down some of the security systems, even the fences that keep the viscious T-Rex in its paddock. The visitors are in for the night of their life.<BR>  Steven Speilberg has overdone it with stunningly detailed dinosaurs and visual effects with the help of Industrial Light and Magic of California. With this DVD and a home theater system, it feels as if you're in the park with dinosaurs surrounding you. This is an excellent portrayal of Michael Crichton's best seller. The DVD also includes a 'behind the scenes' documentary for those of you who would like to know how they accomplished this masterpiece.
6305922748|5.0|Rob Reiner, who started out on \\"All in the Family,\\" came into his directorial own with this hilariously scathing look at the rock music industry. Reiner plays a documentary filmmaker chronicling the American tour of a loud and sexist heavy-metal band who gives new meaning to the term \\"washed up.\\" In the midst of the tour, he presents inside dirt on the fictional group, from the dimwitted guitarist whose pride and joy is a guitar he never even points at, to the only slightly smarter lead singer whose girlfriend destroys the group a la Yoko Ono.<br />The band lurches from catastrophe to catastrophe, from malfunctioning props to cancelled concerts. Two of the funniest bits involve the band getting lost under the stage and a horrendously undersized Stonehenge. Not to mention an album signing at which no one shows up and a disastrous attempt at branching out into jazz.<br />Future-star cameos are in abundance, including Billy Crystal, Fran Drescher, Paul Shaffer and Dana Carvey. So turn your amps to 11, watch for the exploding drummer, and enjoy the movie.
B00006399Z|4.0|This fine live disc is a reminder of how well Dave Mason fitted into the band and how he added so much to their overall sound.His songs(&quot;sad and deep as you&quot; and &quot;shouldn't have took more than you gave&quot;)really shine in this context.<BR>As a live band Traffic were able to imbue their tunes with a life that the studio versions often lacked and the interplay between the musicians is fabulous ( especially when we consider the problems that Dave Mason seemed to have with working with the other band members). Steve Winwood,Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood all get a chance to take centre stage and Wood in particular produces some great solos( the tender flute solo in SADAY for example).Ric Grech and Jim Gordon are a faultless rhythm section who never overplay the tunes.When I get around to compiling my list of the top ten live albums of the seventies ,this disc will be on it,need I say more.
0316666343|5.0|This book is one of the most eloquently written books I have ever read!  The prose is so vivid and loaded with imagery that you can see it all in your minds-eye.  The narrator is refreshing, especially in the way that, while she never grows old, she does grow up.  The lessons learned hold true to many things you learn on the road to adulthood (though learning to deal with your death is hopefully not!).  The story held my attention throughout the entire length of the book, never boring me.  I feel that many who don't like this book have just yet to fully understand or open themselves up to what it is saying.  I honestly believe that this is one of the best books written in a long time.  From a writers point of view, I don't see how anyone could believe that just anyone could have written this.  The loaded language and enticing narrator are things that are very original.  It's a new twist on an old subject (murder)-refreshing in a world where it seems that sometimes there isn't any talent left out there.
B000000XCA|5.0|One of the first songs I ever heard from CCR was \\"Born on the Bayou\\". Along with \\"Graveyard Train\\" from this album, \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\" from Willy and the Poor Boys, and \\"Ramble Tamble\\" from Cosmo's Factory, it may still be my favorite tune. With so much of this album sounding like southernish swamp rock, it's hard to believe these guys are from the bay area in California instead of New Orleans or Mobile. <br />Aside from the great \\"Born on the Bayou\\", other great songs include the short but catchy \\"Bootleg\\", the rockin' \\"Penthouse Pauper\\", and a version of \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\" that only vaguely (at best) sounds like Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels.  I tend to become bored with radio staples of classic rock songs but \\"Proud Mary\\" never seems to get old. Two of the best songs here are the two longest. \\"Graveyard Train\\" plods along with a sense of foreboding (not the happiest of songs, but who cares?) and \\"Keep on Chooglin'\\" is the perfect jam to end the album. Far better than their first album, this should be the place to start.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Everyone is so caught up in what Christina doesnot have on that they fail to hear the music. When I hear her on MTV doing a preveiw I knew I had to have the CD. She sounds so good that I would recommend it to anyone.  Please look at the album and not the lack of clothing if you don't your relly missing a brilliant CD.  If you get the CD you will hear her say that what you see now is her.Plain and simple.
B00005JL95|5.0|If you, like me, saw the uninspired original trailers to the movie (heck, even the poster) and thought, \\"little girl and cutesy alien party down in Hawaii - boring\\", you were misled and cheated!  <br />I finally saw this flick on the airplane out to the East Coast and I was completely charmed and amazed by it.  What, a broken family nearing disintegration? Child Protective Services? An evil, if cute, alien?  How novel, how un-Disney, I thought at first.  But it is a clever and modern update to the Ugly Duckling story, after all.  The themes of redemptive love, of finding your place and your 'family' in the world are powerfully played out.  The movie balances humor and seriousness in excellent fashion.  And the ending pan of photographs, well, it just made me cry, which is not what a 40+-yr old rocket engineer expects to do on a full United flight.<br />Definitely a movie worth seeing and buying!  The art and the message are both great.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I love TATU. i`ve been listenin to their music for about a year. i got only 2 listen to 2 of their songs in english and the rest were all in Russin. Both in english and Russin, they sound great, i love this group. the only thing i fear of is a good group like this goin bad due to the mainstream of pop music in the US. Many underground groups have sold out and their music go to waste, i hope this won`t happen to TATU. TATU is a great group, they sound great in both engilsh and Russin even though u don`t know what they are sayin when u listenin to Russin, if u don`t know Russin like me. So u should get the CD, i already got the import of their Russian CD and it was great, and i can`t wait to go out and get their english version.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Don't listen to the naysayers.  This is a well-put-together CD which summarizes the short but brilliant reign of Nirvana quite well.  To all the self-proclaimed 'True Nirvana Fans'(tm): Sorry if you think that this CD is a disappointment, but it *is* a greatest hits CD.  Not a 'Please-The-Self-Proclaimed-Hardcore-Fans-With-14-B-Sides' CD, but a greatest hits CD.  And furthermore, yes, Courtney Love and Geffen do get money from it...but did it ever occur to you that Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic are also getting royalties from Nirvana sales?
0060512806|3.0|This book is not one that you'll read in one evening. It's an interesting intertwining of two stories, one set in WWII and one in the present.  Interpersed with the narratives are various digressions on cryptography and mathematics, which some nerds (myself included) will find interesting, but I suspect most people will just skip as being too arcane. Whenever I see a book of this length I suspect that the author is being paid by the word (or pound) or simply does not have the discipline to write a book that is reasonably concise.  What the author should find most embarassing is that he has written a book of over 1000 pages AND STILL DIDN'T FINISH THE STORY! This book ends as if the editor told him &quot;Neal, that's enough, there are only so many trees on the planet.&quot; The odd thing is that I don't think there are any plans for a sequel. What seemed like some of the most interesting story lines are just dropped. This was a good effort, but somebody should have had their blue pencil handy to reign in the author. Maybe he should have broken up the two story lines and written as two books, so he would have had enough room left to finish the stories.
0790751089|1.0|I am usually a liberal minded person. But I really had a difficult time rooting for this couple.<br />The scenery and the location are fantastic. The performances by Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep are among the best of their careers. But on personal moral grounds I have to give this movie a bad review.<br />Francesca is a bored an unfulfilled housewife. Her husband, who is away, is not a bad character, he doesn't abuse or neglect her, she is just not content with her life and ends up having an affair.<br />She breaks sacred vows for moments of selfish pleasure and we are supposed to be on her side? How about telling the story from the perspective of her husband who may someday finds out about the affair. His bond with his wife has been broken, his trust in her has been shattered. How do we feel about Francesca now? Do we now still feel sorry for this poor unfulfilled heroine? And Clint Eastwood's character doesn't get off easy either. I think it is good that he discovers he is vulnerable and that he does need people and intimacy in his life, but where are his values and integrity? This may look like love to him but it is lust. Love is honoring commitments, not only the ones an individual makes, but also honoring the commitments and boundaries of others.<br />Affairs break hearts and ruin families. I don't think that this is something we as a culture and society need to condone and romanticizes. Sure, stories such as these are dramatic, they sell, and they try to make some type of statement. But I think it does come down to values. Values, that is a word that has been bantered about so much I think it may have lost its meaning. To value something is to treasure, honor, and to reserve whatever it is we value as something special, and sacred. The irony in \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" is that it communicates to us the message that commitment, love, and sex, no longer hold that place of value. If there is a moral victory in the fact that she stayed with her family, the victory is hollow. Because the film, in its romanticized view of the affair, tries to leave the audience with the impression that her choice to stay with her family was somehow a loss for her...and that is very sad.ictory is hollow. Because the film, in its romanticized view of the affair, tries to leave the audience with the impression that her choice to stay with her family was somehow a loss for her...and that is very sad.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you have &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, you need to get this DVD set. It follows E Company of the 2nd Bn/506th Reg of the 101st Airborne Divison throughout their European campaign. Excellent cinematography blended with special effects. Characters are reasonably well developed, but there are a lot of them to follow. Direction and attention to authenticity are excellent. They went to great lengths to make sure all equipment and vehicles looked like the real thing down to the correct number of wheels. Great scenes and action from D-Day, Operation Market Garden and Bastogne. A &quot;must-have&quot; for any WWII buff.
B00005J73X|4.0|I am not a fan of live albums, but a huge fan of Bon Jovi.  My husband wanted to get this for me, and I almost talked him out of it, because I have all the other albums with these songs on them.  I am glad I let him get it for me anyway.  This is a great live version CD.  I usually hate these CDs.<br />I was not too keen on the song with Sir Bob Geldof.  I mean, what's the point?  I want to hear the band..not him on a Bon Jovi CD.  Their version of Rockin' in the Free World is good.<br />I could listen to them sing anything.  They are truly one of the greatest rock bands ever.<br />If you are looking for a good collection of &quot;greatest hits&quot; I would recommend Crossroads over this CD.  If you are a fan, you need to have this live version in your CD collection.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm not a fan of war movies, so I don't have much to compare this to. I got it for my dad for Christmas and watched it with him, and I must say that it is extraordinary. Well portrayed and entertaining. I was hoping for some more special features, but the ones included were better than average. Definately worth the price.
0671799320|3.0|Interesting book full of extensive research, but as a few other semi-negative reviewers have said what's NOT in the book would be a more useful history of Big Oil.<br />Author has a tendency to go out off on a tangent (or seemingly irrelevant detail), but at least these passages provide dozens of new info for the reader.<br />More serious is the author's apparent hesitancy to dish the dirt on Big Oil, eg. Standard Oil's providing bulk tetraethyl-lead and associated processes to I.G. Farben in the late 30's.<br />Given the detail the author enjoys providing, this omission was intentional, and leaves the reader open to disappointment at what else was elided from the record.
B00005JLD2|5.0|This is an amazing story. The actors and music,draw you in and it pulls at your heart strings. I strongly recommend reading the book also. I am ready to see the sequel. Noyce does a beautiful job.  This historical drama is something all ages should see.I am in awe of these girls courage and determination. This is a saga that is still continuing in their lives of those who remain.<BR>As a mother, I just can't imagine the pain and suffering these women went through and how blind those who partook in this tradegy were. I am fasinated at every detail of the story and would like to learn more.
6300216268|5.0|It is rare for me to find a movie that I can watch more then a few times. This one though I've watched probably over 100 times and I love it just as much as the first time I saw it. It is full of insight, surprises, humour and intelligence. I have since made everyone I know watch/rent this movie and every single person who I made watch it is glad that they did.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Great tracks, and I love the mix between &quot;vintage&quot; FM, and newer versions (taken from their 1997 performance &quot;The Dance&quot;).<br />Big Love, Hold Me, and Silver Springs -- don't miss these.  <br />If you know the story, Lindsey Buckingham (lead guitar), and Stevie Nicks (vocals) used to be romantically involved.  When they broke up, Lindsey wrote the painful &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, and she responded with the seething &quot;Silver Springs.&quot;  Both of these songs are so powerful, and if you can imagine the outpouring of emotion...awesome!<br />If you are a BIG Fleetwood Mac fan, then this is the album for you.  If not, you could always get the more budget concious &quot;Rumors&quot; album, which has their best known songs from the earlier years, for about half the price of this 2 disc set.
B00005ALP6|5.0|Based on Shaw's play &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, this is the story of the flower seller, Eliza Doolittle, (played flawlessly by Hepburn) who is given the chance at a better life by phonetics professor, Henry Higgins. The movie explores human relations and just what makes &quot;high society&quot; who they are. The ending is slightly different than in the play, but it makes for a more perfect &quot;happily ever after&quot;. If you haven't seen this movie, you are really missing out!
B000005DQR|4.0|I got this cd recently but I think it has aged a lot.  Even though it is good I think his new cd is a lot better and it has all new stuff.
0316779237|5.0|This is one of those rare perfect volumes that you just don't find often nowadays.  A stocking stuffer, a secret santa gift, or something just to share with a friend, this is one of the best pieces of literature few dollars will get you.

0316666343|4.0|Good but sad and kind of haunting.  I found myself thinking about this one a lot in the weeks after I finished it.  Reading about Susie's death was quite uncomfortable and maybe not for all readers.  If you can get past that scene though the book is very interesting, riveting and good.
6304414145|3.0|First, Lili Taylor ROCKS. Second: I <BR>think it is totally awesome that Opie put these groovalicious indie actors in <BR>his movie as bad guys.

Mel was Mr. <BR>Ridiculous Macho and Rene was Ms. Passive, Powerless Wife. I mean, why was <BR>Mel in charge of the whole ransom thing?

B000002KGT|5.0|Here it is, musical excellence.  I hold all FM albums in high regard.  Rumours is just a smidge better than the rest.  Like all of the FM albums are at a 10 except Rumours, it's a 10.1.  This album contains the bands' only #1 hit &quot;Dreams&quot;.<br />I hear this record refered to as Lite Rock.  Am i the only one paying attention here?  The lyrics are full of emotion.  Lite Rock doesn't have emotion.  &quot;Players only love you when they're playing&quot;?  Stevie isn't a player, she's only a singer.  Lindsey doesn't love her anymore, it's sad really.<br />&quot;The Chain&quot; is the best song on here.  but they are all good, like &quot;Gold dust woman.&quot;  The remake of that song by Hole is worth a listen, even though Stevie says it's too hard for her taste.  She prefers the Dixie Chicks version of &quot;Landslide&quot;, which is just sick.  They ruined that song.  And what about the video?  Natalie Maines is dressed up like Stevie.  The other one, not the pregnant one, is dressed up like Christine.  And that's just wrong.  Sorry, that wasn't really relevant.<br />Yes, I even really like &quot;I don't want to know&quot;.  Even though it wasn't meant for this album.  It was supposed to be &quot;Silver springs&quot; in it's place.  But it was decided that &quot;Silver springs&quot; ran too long to go on the record.  So it was decided that they would use an extra Stevie song that she had laying around.  It was released as a B-side, but that's not enough.  Then Stevie wanted it for Timespace but she wasn't given the rights to it.  Thank god for The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac or i may have never heard the original studio version of this great song.<br />So anywho.  This is a great album.  People think Fleetwood Mac and they think Rumours.  No one i've met though.  No one around here knows who they are.  Even the people older than me have no clue.  I'm 19!  This is sad. But go buy this album, you're life will be better for it.
0312853238|5.0|I read Ender's Game last year and can say with all honesty that it is a book you will not want to put down.  I didn't, all through that school day and into the early hours of the morning...with school the next day.<br />I am a fan of science-fiction and a voracious reader, so when I heard about this story it was natural that I would read it.  However, I can see how this book will appeal to more than sci-fi fans because the story here, while taking place aboard and orbiting school where children are trained as commanders for an upcoming war against an alien race, is a human story.  It is not littered with technical jargon or futuristic weapons, nor weighed down by descriptions of a future world.<br />No, the story is a human one, about a child sent away at six-years-old.  About the experiances of this child, Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, and the others at Battle School.  The children, though brilliant, have the same thoughts and impulses that normal kids do.  The pace is slow enough to take the events to heart, and quick enough that the years of Ender's childhool fly by.<br />&quot;I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and I tell you he's the one.&quot;
B000002KXO|5.0|It seems a little silly to compare Mirage to Rumours.  People have to except that this was the direction the band was going at the time.  i don't feel the need to compare and contrast Fleetwood Mac albums.  They are all great.<br />&quot;Love in store&quot; is a good song.  Christine gets a lot of praise from me.  I love her and need to find her first solo album Christine Perfect.<br />I happen to like all of Lindsey's songs on here.  &quot;Can't go back&quot; is great.  It's no &quot;Second hand news&quot;...big deal.  It's no &quot;Family man&quot; either but i'm not cyring over it.  it's just a good song.  Except it.<br />I truly love &quot;That's alright.&quot;  The chorus is the best. It's Stevie, what more can i say?<br />&quot;Book of love&quot; features good lyrics and good vocals especially in the chorus.  &quot;walked out, goodbye/ I swore I never would cry/ Tore a page of my heart/ She wants me to be her friend/ I'm lonely again.&quot;  Good stuff.<br />What does one think of when they hear &quot;Stevie Nicks&quot;?  &quot;Gypsy&quot; of course.  I love the video for this song too.  VH1 would do well to start showing Fleetwood Mac videos in place of Creed and that John Mayer guy.  <br />&quot;Only over you&quot; is good.  No, this really isn't another &quot;Song bird&quot;.  Christine is no fool.  hehe<br />Lindsey did well with &quot;Empire State&quot;.  &quot;New York, watch me burn ya down/ Straight, straight through the heart of town.&quot;  Yeah, that's cool.<br />&quot;Straight back&quot; is naturally very good.  I get &quot;it just sounds like a typical solo Stevie song&quot; from my brother.  And i've heard it from other people too.  What's the difference between solo Stevie and Fleetwood Mac Stevie?  Is this so incredibly different from her other work with FM and I've just been fooling myself for years?  I don't think so.<br />I'm just rambling and this is getting long so i'm going to wrap this up as quickly as possible.  &quot;Hold me&quot; is very good.  &quot;Oh diane&quot; is very good.  &quot;Eyes of the world&quot; is very good. And &quot;Wish you were here&quot; is very good.  And yes, the begining of the latter does sound like &quot;Silver Springs&quot;.  I'll save my rant about &quot;Silver springs&quot; for my Rumours review.<br />Go and buy this album immediately.
0066214122|3.0|Michael Crichton has a pretty good schtick. Research a current scientific or sociological trend to death, then regurgitate it in an easily-readable novel format palatable to the lowest common denominator. He does it often and he does it well. Perhaps too well. Because it's beginning to appear as though he's doing the same thing over and over again ... <br />\\"Prey\\" is an interesting concept, concerning the efforts to develop nanotechnology. Of course, in Crichton's world, science refuses to behave; arrogant scientists push limits and the scientific subjects break loose, causing a big mess and hijinx ensue. One right-thinking scientist warns against using the new technology before it is properly tested, then saves the day with his superior knowledge and skill.<br />In \\"Prey\\", the hero is stay-at-home dad Jack Forman, a former programmer who loses his job because he finds out the CEO is morally-corrupt and tries to blow the whistle. Crichton spends pages and pages describing how Jack takes to being a house husband, changing diapers, fixing dinner, refereeing squabbles. We get the point: Jack's a Good Guy, with Capital Letters.<br />Jack's wife, Julia, works for a company that has developed a medical imaging system that uses nanotechnology to take pictures of the inside of the body. This is the company for which things go Terribly Wrong. A cloud of nanoparticles breaks loose and is terroroizing the fabrication facility deep in the Nevada desert.<br />Because Jack worked on the code that runs the particles, he's called in to save the day and this is where the book becomes \\"Jurassic Nanoparticles\\". At the facility, we are introduced to a group of people who are working on the project. Their names are not important, for they are barely-sketched characters to be used as nano-fodder for the remainder of the novel.<br />The first third of the novel was almost unreadable. Crichton attempts to get us into the head of Joe Average, having conversations about diapers and managinga household where the kids slap each other and call one another \\"Monkey Butt\\". But it appears Crichton himself is a long, long way from being an average guy. I doubt he ever shopped for diapers or picked up his own dry-cleaning, so he instead seems to have cribbed all his knowledge of family life from \\"Mr. Mom\\" and \\"E.T.\\"<br />Things DO heat up a bit when he gets to the facility in the desert. This is where Crichton shows his chops as a master story teller. His writing is still a little sloppy and choppy, but he keeps things going by building and releasing tension at a steady rate. Many questions are answered, only to raise more questions. This is what Crichton does best and it is why I still read him.<br />Plotting is a little sloppy, as well, as there are many inconsistencies throughout. People behave in odd ways, contact with the nanoparticles kills some but not others and has different affects on those it doesn't kill. But this is par for the course in a Crichton novel.<br />...\\"Prey\\" is fun, even though you've seen it all before.

0385484518|5.0|This was my book review for english that includes descriptions of the characters, summary of plot, and reccomendations.<br />     Mitch Albom's novel Tuesdays With Morrie is a true story about a dying man named Morrie Schwartz and a young man, Mitch Albom.  Morrie was Mitch's professor in college and taught classes on the meaning of life.  Morrie had always been Mitch's favorite teacher, and at graduation he promised Morrie that he would keep in touch with him.  Sadly, over the years, the two fell out of touch as Mitch became a wealthy businessman who lost sight of the teachings of his college professor.  One day, Mitch was flipping through the channels on television and saw an interview between Morrie Schwartz and Ted Koppel.  Morrie was discussing his battle with the disease ALS.  Mitch realized that he needed to visit Morrie and catch up before it was too late.  The novel focuses on Morrie's fight with the disease as he tried to inspire in Mitch the lessons about life that he learned so many years ago, but seemed to have lost sight of.<BR> Mitch is a man in his thirties and has a wife named Janine.  He writes freelance as a sports columnist for the paper and his main focus on life is on material things before he reconnects with Morrie.  Following the shock that his favorite teacher has a life-threatening disease, he decides to visit Morrie thousands of miles away.  He makes a weekly routine of this and proceeds to visit him every Tuesday.  Mitch tries to keep things as normal as possible with Morrie in spite of the fact that things are obviously changing.  He records on videotape his many sessions with Morrie in hopes to help other people realize that life is not about material things.<BR> Morrie is a man of 78 who has two grown sons and a wife, Charlotte.  Mitch Albom describes Morrie as looking like a cross between a biblical prophet and a Christmas elf.  As his disease progresses, he feels the need to talk with Mitch more and more.  Morrie tries to make Mitchrealize that many people lead meaningless lives, rushing to meet deadlines and not making time for family.  Every Tuesday, he and Mitch get together to talk about life's challenges, such as death, marriage, aging, regrets, and forgiveness.  Even as he is dying, he manages to inspire those around him to live life to the fullest.<BR> I liked that this book was a true story.  It gives more meaning to the story, knowing that this actually happened.  This book also has a theme that is needed in our world today, that is, to make the most of your time on Earth, to live life to the fullest, and to realize that the most important things in life are not those that money can buy.  The novel starts with Morrie at the beginning of his battle with ALS and finishes with him dying from it.  Mitch Albom wrote this novel in such a way that the reader feels that he is there with him through the struggle.<BR> I did not like that Morrie died at the end.  Morrie's death was imminent, but  was nonetheless depressing.  This is the only thing that I did not like about the novel.  Everything else I enjoyed reading.<BR> I would recommend this book to everyone because it deals with how to live life to the fullest and also discusses the need for humans to genuinely care for one another.  Tuesdays With Morrie is a sad but true story of one man's journey through life and another's realization that life's most important moments cannot be bought.

B00005JLSC|4.0|Chicago, a film version of the incredibly popular stage musical, stars Catherine Zeta Jones as nightclub singer Velma Kelly, Renee Zellwegger as star wannabe Roxie Hart, and Richard Gere as sleazy lawyer Billy Flynn. As the film opens, Velma has just killed her cheating husband and Roxie, who dreams of stardom, sleeps with a furniture salesman with supposed showbiz connections. When the salesman doesn't come through with his promise to get Roxie on stage, she shoots him. Both ladies end up in the Cook County Jail on murderess row, under the strong hand of Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton (Queen Latifah). Both are represented by notorious lawyer Flynn, who will do just about anything to win a case. John C. Reilly appears as Roxie's dullard husband, Taye Diggs as the nightclub band leader, and Christine Baranski as one of the newspaper reporters covering Roxie's murder trial.<br />If you like musical theatre, you're going to love this. First off, I have to say how impressed I was with Catherine Zeta Jones. I have never found her very impressive as an actress, but she knocked my socks off here. Her singing and dancing are excellent, and her performance is charismatic (she steals the show). Zellwegger holds her own in the singing and dancing department but has neither the intensity nor the charisma of Jones. It is fun to watch Richard Gere sing and dance and he does a nice job of it. Taye Diggs was hugely under-used--I would have loved to see him in the action more. The song-and-dance numbers are fantastic--sexy, dramatic, and well-choreographed (Cell Block Tango especially). If, like me, you know the songs by heart, it was a faithful enough reproduction that I could sing along in my head. There were a few things that bugged me. Some of the camera work is extremely fast and jerky, to the point of making me physically uncomfortable and, as much as I like Queen Latifah, I just didn't buy her in this role. She was okay as the prison matron but, when she does her \\"When You're Good to Mama\\" stage number, she just seems so out of place and uncomfortable in the gold gown with her bosoms flowing out everywhere. All in all, a WOW of a movie and a good time to boot.ama\\" stage number, she just seems so out of place and uncomfortable in the gold gown with her bosoms flowing out everywhere.

B000069AUI|4.0|i loved the album, i thought amost every second of it was beautiful. i also wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars but since the half option isnt availale i gave it a 4. after reading the last review by Drew Magary, i realized that Coldplay does have potential to give their songs more depth and variety. but i disagree with the notion that they should follow in the paths of Radiohead. The band [radiohead], to me, almost totally reivented themselves. So many people say &quot;Gee, I love their earlier stuff but they lost me on their more recent writtings.&quot; I not saying tha Radiohead's latest material is bad, but they didnt seem to add to their writting, instead they seemed to change it. Coldplay should try to add a little more edge to some of ther songs, but they souldnt attempt to change anything. Their mterial is already captivating. &quot;The Scientist&quot; is a bonafied tear-jerker.
0140288503|5.0|This book was an amazing description of the events in Somalia.  The author's interviews of the participants in the battle led to a realistic and unforgiving account of how the United States use of less than all available military force led to a disaster.  This book balances individual accounts of heroism against very fair critisizm of the leadership involved.  Overall this was an excellent review.  Even if you have seen the movie, it is worth reading the book.  Despite the fact that I knew the ending, I couldn't put the book down.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Of all of them I wish that this series would return to TV. There are too many good characters that got left behind. I hope after Enterprise concludes with Scott Backula ... DS9 comes back to TV. The Enterprise saga could warp ahead to the current Trek timeline if fans demanded it. I long for the days of seeing DS9 and NG each week. They should have played them back to back and it would have gotten better ratings. I am very surprised they didn't cross over the two shows with both casts meeting together.<br />What can I say without repeating the other reviewers? Buy this one. You can see the episodes again and again. Just like the original series and still want more. There are still plenty of stories left to tell about DS9 and here's one more fan who wishes they'd come back.<br />On an added note the extras were real sparse.  One I thought could have been better was the one with the props. The mini film takes you into a basement like room where all the DS9 props are stored.  It must have been shot on a shoestring budget.  There was no music or anything to make it appear special.  The interview with Nana Visitor looked like it was taken from one of those entertainment programs like ET.  The most recent interview for the DVD was very brief.<br />How about director commentary for each episode.  The least they could have done was to get some of the actors to do a commentary on a couple of episodes.  J.M.S. did some with the first season of B5. I am very surprised the DS9 set had none.<br />With those faults it's still something I wanted to purchase.  However I hope the guys at Paramount are more creative on the next few season box sets.

B00006IUL2|5.0|Pasolini has the dubious distinction of being the only great filmmaker who was murdered, possibly at the behest of a right-wing faction which loathed the openly gay, Marxist, atheist - and popular - artist. Whatever the facts of his death, his reputation as one of Italy's greatest talents is based securely on his poetry, novels, works of critical theory and, in particular, the 25 films he directed. They include such stylistically diverse works as Accatone (1961; adapted from his own novel about life in the slums of modern Rome), The Gospel According to Matthew (1964; a beautiful, moving film about Christ), a stunning version of the Arabian Nights (1974), and his last film, the most nauseating masterpiece I have ever seen, Salò (1975; the Marquis de Sade's 1780s novel updated to Mussolini's Fascist Italy). But Pasolini's most underrated film is his startling version of Medea (1969). Its recent release on DVD (from Vanguard-Cinema) makes this is an opportune time to revisit the ultimate incarnation of the adage, Hell has no fury like a woman scorned.<br />Pasolini takes a unique approach to Medea. He jettisons all but a few lines of Euripides, and begins the narrative many years before the action of the play. Most strikingly, he shoots almost the entire film in a documentary-like style. And, with a couple of notable exceptions, he creates a picture with almost no dialogue, although the soundtrack features an astonishing musical score (put together by Pasolini) of native North African wind and percussion music (20 years before Peter Gabriel's score for Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, which was clearly inspired by Pasolini). If that was not enough to offend purists, in the title role he cast perhaps the most famous opera diva of the century, Maria Callas, in her only film appearance, and then gave her almost no lines (and the few she had were dubbed). Perhaps if audiences had known a bit more about what to expect from the film, they would have seen what was on the screen, instead of what Pasolini consciously - and often brilliantly - stripped away from his sources.<br />He opens with a witty prologue in which an unforgettable Centaur lectures baby Jason about his mythical lineage. So many gods and goddesses are mentioned in this breathless monologue, that the overwhelmed kid falls over backwards, sound asleep. (There is perhaps as much dialogue in these first three minutes as in the rest of the film.) Then Pasolini plunges us into Medea's world. In one of the film's most astonishing sequences, we witness, and feel, every moment of the ritual sacrifice of a young man, whose blood the people of Colchis smear over the plants and trees, to ensure the continued fertility of their land. Pasolini's artistry makes this event as poetic and authentic (indigenous North Africans, not extras from Central Casting, enact the Colchians) as it is gruesome. You may have read about such ancient rites in anthropology, but Pasolini depicts it unflinchingly. And he shows us, in visceral terms, exactly what kind of world produced Medea, whose revenge will be enacted years later on her faithless husband.<br />Throughout, Pasolini invests every shot with a haunting, ripely sensuous look, almost always grounded in a cinéma vérité style. The film literally glows like burnished bronze, with many shots done at the \\"magic hour,\\" just before sunset, which naturally provides an orange/gold sheen. The major stylistic exception is the scenes in the court of King Creon (played by Massimo Girotti, star of Visconti's 1941 film Ossessione), where Pasolini drolly mimics Eisenstein's expressionistic designs from that masterpiece of political intrigue, Ivan the Terrible (1943-1946).<br />Much of Medea's enormous power comes from the naturalistic performances, ranging from the leads to the many minor characters. This is what the Argonauts might really have been like, a group of mostly quiet young men, doing their jobs, enjoying the thrill of battle when theopportunity arises, and gawking at the strange sights of Colchis's radically foreign culture. Giuseppe Gentile creates a complex Jason whom we believe a powerful woman like Medea could fall passionately in love with, who is devoted to his children, yet who is so fickle, not to mention hungry for power, that he would throw over his wife of 10 years to marry the daughter of his enemy, King Creon, as a backhanded way of regaining his throne.<br />Pasolini draws a monumental performance from Maria Callas, who uses her few lines of dialogue to great effect. Simply by using her face and body, Callas suggests - with a subtlety unexpected from an opera diva - Medea's immense range of emotions, from heartbreaking tenderness to volcanic rage.<br />Perhaps the best way to enjoy Pasolini's Medea is to put aside thoughts of Euripides, and later versions by such dramatists as Seneca, Pierre Corneille, and Jean Anouilh, not to mention Hollywood extravaganzas like Jason and the Argonauts (whether the fun 1963 version, with Ray Harryhausen's special effects wizardry, or the bland TV mini-series from 2000). Experience Pasolini's mesmerizing film on its own starkly beautiful terms, and you will find a unique vision not only of the ancient Mediterranean, recreated with what feels like astonishing fidelity, but of the tortured interplay of love, desire, and unspeakable revenge, which can be as current as the latest crime of passion.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2's Achtung Baby is one of the best (if not the best) cd's I have ever heard.  The songs are all number ones in my book.   'Mysterious Ways' and 'The Fly' are just two examples of excellent rock, electronica and dance.  It is a rock ablum plus a dance ablum all at once.  Bono is the 'Man'!  Buy this if you haven't already.  You won't be sorry.  Even my mom sings 'Even Better than the Real Thing' and she is strictly Barbara Streisand.

B00005JLRR|4.0|\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" reteams the crew from the \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" TV series and ensuing feature films. Once more, we enter the sci-fi world of the intrepid crew of the Starship \\"Enterprise.\\" This latest installment in the ongoing \\"Trek\\" saga opens with turmoil on Romulus, the homeworld of one of humanity's perennial foes. The \\"Enterprise,\\" still under the command of Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart), is sent out to deal with the situation. The film introduces a new alien race: the Remans, who hail from Romulus' sister planet. Key to the story is Shinzon, who grew up on the Reman homeworld yet has a strange and very personal connection to Picard.<br />\\"Nemesis\\" certainly has a lot of good elements going for it. The Remans, who reminded me of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" type demons, are a visually impressive alien race, and equally impressive is Shinzon's massive warship. There are some well played action sequences, and it's great to see the Next Gen crew together again.<br />But I felt by the film's end that its makers had aimed for an epic scope and emotional resonance which they never quite achieved. While the film is certainly a great improvement over the last Next Gen feature (the limp \\"Insurrection\\"), it never achieves the heights reached in the best of the Next Gen films (\\"First Contact\\") or in the best of the TV episodes.<br />Maybe part of the problem is the villain Shinzon, played by Tom Hardy. He too often comes across as a petulant schoolboy. I didn't fully buy him as the brilliant, battle-hardened military commander he allegedly is. He's not in the same league as Trek's best villains, like Khan or the Borg Queen. Also, while the Remans are visually striking and as a species have a compelling history, I felt that in the end they were underdeveloped as a new alien race. And while Ron Perlman brings a commanding presence to his role as the Reman Viceroy, I felt the filmmakers seriously underutilized his great talents.<br />Other aspects of the film struck me as gratuitous or clumsily put together (particularly some sexual innuendo that seems stuck at a junior high mentality). And, like \\"Star Trek: Insurrection,\\" some aspects of the film had a \\"been there, done that\\" feel to them; Hardy's Shinzon in particular felt uncomfortably like a rip-off of a certain blonde nemesis already faced by the Next Gen crew during their TV run.<br />These gripes aside, I must still say that I enjoyed \\"Nemesis,\\" and I do hope that this film is not the end of the line for either the Next Gen crew or the toothy Remans.struck me as gratuitous or clumsily put together (particularly some sexual innuendo that seems stuck at a junior high mentality).

B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John definitely has the edge over Michael Jackson as the true King Of Pop. This is a blockbuster package with many much more memorable hit singles included here, as well as his most famous key album tracks than the self proclaimed 'king of pop' could ever even claim during a career that has mostly fizzled in the past decade. Elton John just &quot;Keeps On Trucking&quot; up and down the charts, and this new collection should garner him a multi-platinum award. Elton John needs to release &quot;TO BE CONTINUED...&quot; Box Set #2 as soon as possible. This is an incredible &quot;must have&quot; collection of some of the grandest highlights of Elton John's career.
1563896656|1.0|First off: Alan Moore is brilliant, just to get that out of the way. The &quot;Comics-as-Literature&quot; movement is due in large part to Moore's work in the 80s, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and &quot;Watchmen.&quot; His writing is typically dark and satirical, but his creations are some of the most inventive and imaginative out there. Comics are what they are today because of Alan Moore, and he is the best at what he does.<br />Usually.<br />But this... this seems more like a writing exercise than a complete story. It's a pastiche of the writers of the day, written in the style of the day. Like he said, &quot;I'm bored. Let's see, what would happen if Captain Nemo and Allan Quartermain were drafted by the British Government.&quot;  The story comes second to research, as Moore tries to squeeze in as many &quot;in-jokes&quot; as possible on each page.<br />O'Neill's art is serviceable, but a little on the &quot;underground&quot; side--that is, scratchy and cartoony. And there were several times when the art was hard to follow.<br />All in all, very disappointing. Since most of the characters in the book are in public-domain, there are other novels available dealing with the concept of fictional characters meeting each other, and they are done better than this.
6304806418|3.0|The movie was good but I just couldn't get over the fact that they hired Madonna. I mean people should think before they totally trash a legend. There are alot of talented Latino actress' that would have done a wonderful job with this part. Antonio Banderas was great in this film. He has a magnificient voice and  I hear he is going to play the phantom of the opera for his next musical which should be good. I hate movies that focus on the actor or actress more so than the story. Which is what happened with this movie. Take a hint from LOTR. Hire an unknown and make a better movie.
0802133347|5.0|This novel's explicit sexual descriptions caused a great deal of controversy when it was first published in 1928. However, now that the literary world has embraced erotica, Lady Chatterley's Lover is now considered classic.<br />D.H. Lawrence describes the sexual exploits between an unhappily married woman and her lover with beautiful prose and poetic undertones. The bold descriptions of the forbidden romance between the protagonists left me longing for more -- so to speak. The novel is mixture of romance and erotica, and said story has inspired authors to venture into this once obscure genre in literature.<br />Are you an erotica enthusiast? Then I suggest you read the novel that started it all. Lady Chatterley's Lover is one of the best literary experiences I've ever had!

0316776963|5.0|This has got to be one of the funniest books I've ever read. David Sedaris's essays are full of insight and wit. His comic timing is precise when he describes his childhood, his family and his eccentric friends.

0399103422|5.0|No, I really am serious.  The Godfather is number one on my list of really great books and I highly doubt it will ever budge from that position.  This book is nothing short from amazing.  It is pure brilliance.  Mario Puzo takes a fascinating concept-the struggle of a New York crime family (the Corleones) for underworld power-and unveils the intricacies of this concept very slyly, very stylishly.  <br />Part of Puzo's genius is his use of the characters in the book.  He spends time with each of them, letting us readers know their personal fears, worries, morality, etc, etc.  Though Don Corleone is the Godfather of the Corleone crime empire (he orders executions, kills people himself, etc.), we can begin to see that he has morality.  This issue of morality in crime is continuously grappled with in the book.  Also, his son, Michael Corleone becomes more and more complex throughout the book.  The evolution of the characters are simply amazing; I've never seen it done so well before.  Though the book is incredibly violent, it is also beautiful.  <BR> <BR>The story itself is unforgettable.  It is also unpredictable.  The book is incredibly clever with endless tricks and twists to keep us guessing until the very last page.  There are all these classic human emotions in it: love, vengeance, betrayal, rage, evil, etc.  And these emotions are most curiously entwined to weave a really great story about the Corleone family and the loyalty that bonds them.  <br />It is an amazing story.  You can read it over and over and over again and find new things that you missed the last time.
0060512806|4.0|I knew I was reading a good book when, about a quarter of the way in, I found myself nostalgic for high school math classes - the first time *that* has ever happened!  Stephenson has managed to accomplish what only a very few writers are able to do - bring out the minutiae of daily life in a way both interesting and entertaining.  Sometimes he does it by reducing life to mathematical equations.  Sometimes it's just a character opining on the banal (like the best way to eat Captain Crunch; it's best to keep the milk separate).  Think Stephen King without the sense of ickiness.<br />Plotwise, the novel consists of two storylines that at first share no connection except a family relationship between characters.  Gradually, however, the stories begin to tie in to each other, coming closer to together - a fascinating process that unfortunately ends with a thud.  Stephenson brings the two threads together but never ties them up, leaving a keen sense of disappointment.<br />Still, Cryptonomicon is immensely enjoyable while you're in the middle of it, and really will make you pine for algebra.
B00000J9HE|5.0|While it's easy to take pot-shots at von Karajan's somewhat homogenized \\"sound\\", the Berlin Philharmonic's \\"beautification\\" of angular textures, the \\"swooping\\" string entries, the \\"nasal\\" first oboist, ad naseum, it's likewise a bit stingy for reviewers to ignore what that longstanding musical partnership did so well with music they truly understood.  Such was the case with von Karajan and Sibelius; to his credit, he built upon his early succcesses with the Philharmonia Orchestra, and by the end of the 1970s, he and the Berlin Philharmonic had built up a body of recordings that continue to give evidence of a great marriage between powerful symphonic writing and nuanced, thoughtful performance.<br />The 2-disc set involved here, Sibelius' Symphonies 4 through 7, plus \\"The Swan of Tuonela\\" and \\"Tapiola\\", recaps the best of the von Karajan/Berlin era, analogue recordings made during the mid- and late-60s by DG in the Jesus Christus Kirche facility in Berlin. When the orchestra moved into the new Philharmonie in the mid-70s, the sense of \\"air\\" around the orchestra was lost, not to mention the liveness of the vaulted plaster interior.  For this DG \\"Originals\\" reissue, the engineers have thinned some of the old lower midrange muddiness that often plagued some of the best recordings of the period.  Bass response is a bit lighter, and consequently brass-heavy passages may seem more dominant that they did in the LP format.  The net gain, though, I believe is all to the good.  The greater transparency has more of the quality that EMI's engineers brought to the same locale.  Analogue tape hiss is minimal, and the soundstage is both wide and deep.<br />So much for sound; what about the performances?  Karajan is tightly controlling when it comes to nuance, color, and timbre.  These are not \\"spontaneous\\", spur-of-the-moment summonings from the musical ether.  Frankly, a little of that goes a long way with Sibelius.  It's too easy to cruise along and stop to point out this or thatisolated bit of harmonic interest, or inflate a forgotten \\"inner voice.\\"  What von Karajan does is rather elemental to art of bringing Sibelius to life: he finds the pulse or core rhythm to the movements, and draws them together to build the musical architecture, or \\"span\\" of the piece. This doesn't imply a horse race from beginning to end, but rather a reluctance to dawdle in pools of rubato.  Real orchestral power is built up and sustained, not thrown at you like a succession of one-two punches.  What results is a sense of rightness and inevitability that eludes less effective conductors.<br />In sum, then, is all that is contained an unqualified rave?  No.  Other conductors have made stronger cases for Symphony 7, for example (to be fair, it's also the most difficult to bring off).  A bit more impetuousness in some of the massed string entries might have increased the drama in Symphony 4.  The strength of Sibelius as a symphonist, and as a unique voice, offers more than one avenue for conductors and orchestras to follow in bringing his music to life.  The closest parallel to von Karajan in conducting Sibelius might be Ormandy.  Snatch up the Sony reissue of his recordings of Symphonies 2 and 7, outstandingly performed and recorded in Philadelphia during the late 50s. Talk about control! For a more \\"Finnish\\"-sounding reading, listen to Vanska's cycle with the Lahti orchestra (here's hoping he'll try a cycle with the Minnesota Orchestra once he's settled there!).  A \\"bigger\\" sound can be had through the efforts of Ashkenazy and Davis, with the Philarmonia and LSO, respectively.  But, I wouldn't want to be without von Karajan and his single-minded, powerfully executed evocation of the Sibelian landscape.  His thoughts on these scores, and the magisterial playing of the Berlin Philharmonic at its peak, are not to be dismissed lightly.
B00005ARDC|5.0|My first experience with B.R.M.C. actually at 4:00 a.m. on a Saturday night: I had an insomnia and was watching MTV, then I saw the opening credits to the video for \\"Love Burns.\\" I thought their name was clever so I listened carefully. By the end of the video I was ADDICTED. The next day I went out and bought their cd. B.R.M.C. draws heavily from the other fuzzy rock bands yes, but then again do we really need another Blink182/Green Day rip-off? Of course not. B.R.M.C. flows with emotion through fuzzy vocals, feedback, and catchy, yet somewhat hazy riffs, and for me that is perfection. \\"Love Burns,\\" \\"Whatever Happened to My Rock 'N Roll (punk song),\\" \\"Head Up High,\\" and \\"Salvation\\" are my personal favorites, but they're all excellent. Other than that 4 am MTV experience I have never seen their video played and it is a great shame that a wonderful band like this will probably never get the attention they deserve.
B00006879E|5.0|I really was happy to come upon a band with it's own sound. Maroon 5 says exactly what most adolescent teens out there like me need to here. BUY IT! You'll enjoy it to the fullest, and you'll want to know much more about the band. Every song is good... Normally when you buy an album...you have to skip over tracks that just don't agree with you. This CD doesn't force you to do that...ENJOY!

B00004ZAV3|3.0|This is a great album for new fans of the Fab Four, but it doesn't get into who the Beatles really were, and almost completely ignores Lennon's influence on the group.  It is impossible for this to be the only cd of theirs in a collection. A good compelation of songs, but needs a little bit more to be really excellent.<br />          Out of 10, I give this a 7.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|I have always been a big fan of musicals, and I have to say that I was skeptical of a musical starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  After all--could they sing?  Even though Nicole is no Patti Lupone, she does a delightful job in this Baz Luhrman masterpiece.  True to Baz's style, Moulin Rouge is wild, fast-paced and incredibly dramatic.  Ewan McGregor has a GREAT voice, much to my pleaseant surprise.<br />The story is about Bohemian ideals and the search for love and truth.  A poor Bohemian artist, along with his host of absinthe-addicted friends (including a hilariously stunted John Leguizamo as Toulouse Letrec) sees the beautiful Satine as the epitomy of love.  They pitch their hastily compiled idea of a musical to the sleazy duke in \\"Spectacular Spectacular.\\"  All the duke really wants is Satine.  All the rest of them want is to save the Moulin Rouge and reach some Bohemian nirvana.  <br />Much to the Duke's chagrin (you love to hate him) Satine has been taken with the Bohemian artist (McGregor).  Much to the artist's devastation, Satine is afflicted with tuberculosis.  The themes of love, passion, and social classism resound throughout this brilliantly made film.  If you are a fan of Baz Luhrman, you will love this movie.  The music and acting are fantastic.  The story is beautiful.  Watch it with an open mind!
6305308659|5.0|The story at first seems to be a satire on the TV sanitation of the 1950's but this film is much richer and runs much deeper than that. In a comedic and satirical manner it addresses such issues as love, marriage, personal identity and the importance of knowledge. It also tackles serious subjects as well such as racism, book burnings, and even Fascism.  <br />Our two characters: David (Toby Macguire), an intelligent geek with no self-confidence and his sister Jennifer (Reese Whitherspoon), an unintelligent and sexually active teenager get zapped by Don Knotts, of all people, into this 1950's sitcom called \\"Pleasantville\\". <br />Everything in the town of Pleasantville is perfect. It's a beautiful suburb set in the 1950's with the perfectly straight picket fences, with the perfectly dressed men wearing suit and ties, with the perfectly dressed women wearing flowered dresses while making meatloaf.<br />David is euphoric about his insertion into \\"Pleasantville\\" for he gets to interact with his favorite TV show.  Jennifer, on the other hand, feels trapped in a black-and-white prison and decides to shake things up.  <br />There lies the comedy and the subsequent contrast.  Guess what happens when you place a sexually active teenager from the late 1990's into a culture where the parents sleep in twin beds? Though her brother does his best to interact with the locals and keep his sister out of trouble, he too begins to contaminate this world with knowledge and his newly found self-confidence.<br />With the strategic use of color entering into this world, allegorical concepts are introduced with amazing clarity.  I don't want to spoil anything; you just have to see it happen.<BR> <BR>The production design was amazing.  The digital effects were graphically stunning. The range of all of the actors here was also top notch: William Macy crying at the apex of a sentence during an emotional revelation, the body language of Jeff Daniels, The emotional tones of Joan Allen's voice, and you all ready know about how good mega-stars Toby Macguire and Resse Whitherspoon have become.  <br />Best movie of the 1990's

B000063V8U|3.0|The makers of Season 6 of STTNG were faced with a bit of a dilemma.Their STTNG script called \\"the storyteller\\" was given to DS9 despite the objections of the staff,so with a lack of scripts and a smaller budget,the answer was to make more two-parters.Unfortunately,this led to some boring and overlong stories such as the Klingon two-parter \\"Birthright\\".After the eccellence of seasons 3-5,season six was the start of the poorer storylines due to so many episodes being made for the two Trek shows.It simply isn't as entertaining as the previous seasons.STTNG also lost their lighting team to DS9 as well as writers,directors and the O'Brien character.Despite this,there are some good episodes such as the Scotty episode \\"Relics\\",\\"Face Of The Enemy\\" where Troi shows her aggressive side and \\"Timescape\\" directed by Adam Nimoy(son of Leonard).But there are silly episodes like \\"second chances\\" where two Rikers argue with each other and the totally flat \\"Aquiel\\" which just doesn't work at all.For big NG fans only,season 6 is disappointing and is not as entertaining as the previous three seasons.
B00006NSGX|2.0|For the record, I am a HUGE E.C. fan (I even gave \\"Reptile\\" five stars during a prior review).  I saw Eric live at Madison Square Garden during this tour and thought it was a very good show.  However, I found this CD to be very disappointing.  While there were some excellent tracks (eg, an acoustic version of Bellbottom Blues), this CD overall was way too laid back (my wife referred to it as a \\"lounge act\\" (ouch!!)when I played it in the car.  Reminded her of \\"Murph and the Magictones\\" from the \\"Blues Brothers\\" she said (that one really hurt!!!))  The main reason is that the still-present fire in Eric's electric guitar was overwhelmed by incredibly annoying keyboards (eg, in Badge).  My advice to EC is to fire his entire band (except for Nathan East, who is an exceptional bass player), bring back George Terry (EC's second guitarist in the '70's), if he can still play, and hire Zak Starkey(Ringo's kid)to play drums on a new album and for live shows.  (I saw The Who at MSG last summer with Zak on drums and was simply blown away.)  Or try borrowing Sheryl Crow's superb backup band (those who have heard Eric's blistering version of \\"White Room\\" on Sheryl's \\"Live in Central Park\\" CD know exactly what I mean). For EC fans looking for great live material, I would recommend Crossroads II, Derek and the Dominoes-Live at the Fillmore or 1996's Live at Hyde Park over \\"One more Car\\".  Or try to find an old copy of the \\"Old Grey Whistle Test\\" on VHS on eBay.
6305508550|4.0|In case you didn't know, this movie is based on a recurring Mike Judge cartoon in the depressing 1993-94 season of Saturday Night Live. But the main character isn't the guy with the stapler; it's instead Ron Livington's character, who, after being hypnotized by a counselor into being more at peace, doesn't come in to work, yet gets promoted when new management comes in. Okay, so that premise is dubious, but everything else that happens in the movie (i.e., being in a traffic jam where a walking elderly man passes you up, numerous bosses coming up to you for making a mistake, new bosses come and almost everyone is fired) should hit home with you, and if it doesn't, then can I have your job??<br />I got the DVD of this and I'm glad that they didn't stick any special features on here because they're always wack anyway. P.S. This movie is fictional, so don't do what the main character does in this movie. I won't give the plot away; just see it and see what I mean.

6305903182|4.0|Scream 3 was the end complete to the very popular slasher series. Back again, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is being stalked again but this time, no one knows who the killer is! <br />Her story is being turned into a movie and one by one, the actors in the movie are being picked off in a very terrifying manner. Each more individual than the last. Get ready for the finale of Scream because this one will get you going.<br />O.k. let's start out, seeing as how this is the end to a scary movie, there's more blood and the body count is significantly higher. There are numerous twists and turns in the plot and honestly there's no safe bet on who the killer is this time. So really, all bets are off.<br />I won't give away too much because seriously, even the slightest give aways really hurt this movie! But why is that Dewey (David Arquette) back again?! That will always bother me about the Scream series that a character that should have been dead in the first movie, wasn't. <br />Other than that, a vast improvement from both Scream and Scream 2, an awesome soundtrack that includes SLIPKNOT, CREED, STAIND, STATIC-X and many more and let's face a total blood bath. Check this out and don't forget to pick up 1 and 2 otherwise you'll totally ruin it for yourself.

6304140428|5.0|It's no small praise that Elizabeth Taylor's acting in this one at one time was taught in college acting classes, and she's at her best as Martha, the drunken, bawdy and disillusioned wife to then-husband Richard Burton's professionally and emotionally blunted college professor George. Together, Taylor and Burton subject two young neighbors, played stunningly by George Segal and Sandy Dennis, to a night of hell where the line between reality and vicious fantasy of cruel mind games isn't clearly drawn. Taylor, in a class all her own in this one, earned a second Oscar for her tour de force while looking every bit the deglamorized unfulfilled shell of a beauty goddess Martha undoubtedly was. Burton is as compelling in his viciousness that is George's life blood. He was Oscar-nominated as were Segal and Dennis with the latter winning Best Supporting Actress. Shot in black and white and centered in Martha and George's hell house, the intensity of the sense of being penned and the desire to run are urgent and, in the end, we leave George and Martha with a sigh of relief, hoping neverto return and a sense of pity for these two battered souls who, for whatever reason, gave up on life in favor of mutually assured destruction. Taylor is awesome: her performance her may well be the single best ever in cinematic history.

630310696X|4.0|Based on a real-life case, director Jonathan Demme (\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\") sets out in \\"Philadelphia\\" to recount the struggle of one AIDS-infected man seeking judicial redress after he is fired from his job, he believes because of his sexual orientation and terminal illness. Though it certainly wasn't the first film to deal with AIDS, \\"Philadelphia\\" was the first major studio to take on the subject with an A-list cast. As attorney Andrew Beckett seeking to challenge his job termination in court, Tom Hanks, of course, won the first of his two back-to-back Oscars (\\"Forrest Gump\\" followed a year later), and has solid support by Denzel Washington as the reluctant fellow attorney who pleads Beckett's case; Jason Robards, in the dispassionate role of the law partner who orchestrates Beckett's dismissal; Antonio Banderas as Beckett's lover; and Joanne Woodward as Beckett's supportive mother. On that count, the film may be somewhat idealistic in that, tragically, not all gay and AIDS-infected men have the support of their families. But the film does provide important social commentary on institutional prejudice and case law as it applies to the person with AIDS. Sadly, while the film ends with some measure of justice for Beckett, his real-life counterpart was not successful in winning his case against the employer who fired him. The film garnered a second Oscar, that one for Bruce Springsteen's powerful \\"Streets of Philadelphia.\\" In sum, \\"Philadelphia\\" is a relevant social film that speaks to our individual and collective conscience.

B000001F3C|5.0|War comes in like a lion and out like a lamb. The first song, &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday,&quot; arguably U2's most popular song, punches in hard and fast, bringing with it a serious message conveyed by Bono's amazing vocals. War ends with &quot;40,&quot; a meaningful and slow song, the perfect close. In between are mashed the goodies of U2's best. &quot;Seconds&quot; pounds out great percussion, &quot;New Year's Day&quot; sends out wonderful lyrics, and &quot;Surrender&quot; mixes melodic vocals with amazing music. The result is U2's best album, which hardly ever stops for a breather. 'Tis a shame that more of these songs didn't make it onto their Best of the '80s album.
6305313687|5.0|This movie frightened me more than any movie I had ever seen before, mainly because the content is more than just a brilliant story, but an eye-opening reality in many places across America.  I was so frightened that I couldn't even stay in the theater after the movie was over to watch the end credits.  <br />There are two separate and distinct storylines in this movie that are interwoven in order to give the audience the entire picture.  Half the movie is shot in color, symbolizing the present day.  The other half is black and white, representing things that had occurred two years earlier, before Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) was incarcerated.  The movie starts out in black and white, with a gruesome scene where Derek, a white supremacist, executes two African-Americans on his front yard for trying to steal his car.  Subsequent black and white scenes will explain the reasons why these guys were trying to seek revenge by stealing the car.  For his actions, Derek goes to prison for two years, during which time he better grasps the realities of his hatred and decides to change his perspective when he is released.  The present day scenes show Derek and his attempt to dissuade his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps.<br />Director Tony Kaye does a brilliant job of concurrently narrating both of these story lines.  Simultaneously, Kaye shows how hate is learned, and also how it can be unlearned.  Though, this isn't really a movie about how things SHOULD be, but about how things ARE.  While I'm not going to give away the ending, I will say that the battle against racism and hatred is not furthered at the story's conclusion.  ...  However, here we have a movie about an educated, articulate man who believes that he can intelligently justify his rage against anyone who isn't white Protestant.<br />There are several great performances in this movie.  Of course, there's the brilliant performance by Edward Norton, who was rightfully nominated for an Academy Award for this role and probably should have won.  Beverly D'Angelo was also outstanding in the role of Derek and Danny's mother.  I still get goosebumps when I think of her character screaming out that \\"the only thing [she's] ashamed of is that [Derek] came out of her body.\\"  Avery Brooks is also excellent as a high school principal who can be both intimidating and compassionate.  Finally, I have to acknowledge the performance of Ethan Suplee as Seth, the bumbling and impressionable lackey.  Playing a lackey isn't new to Suplee, who had a recurring role on \\"Boy Meets World\\" as the brainless sidekick to the school bully.  He plays the same character here, except that this role is far more powerful and emotionally charged.  There's a memorable scene in the movie where he's driving down the street in a van singing \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" substituted with White Power lyrics.<br />This is an extremely violent movie with many graphic scenes that are definitely not suitable for children and even adults would find disturbing.  However, this movie is extremely compelling, and definitely a must-see.
B000002UEB|5.0|Queensryche has proven themselves to be an amazing metal band before in works such as &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;Rage For Order,&quot; but &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; has surpassed the standards of &quot;great&quot; albums. Opening with the non-musical &quot;I Remember Now,&quot; which introduces the story (if listened to in chronological order, the 15 songs tell a story), followed by the instrumental &quot;Anarchy-X,&quot; which proves to be an interesting minute and a half. Finally &quot;Revolution Calling&quot; comes around and shows that the CD has a lot to show, and that there's more coming up. The first seven tracks are mostly hard-hitting songs, but track eight (&quot;Suite Sister Mary&quot;) slows the story down signifigantly with a ten-minute slow song. After that, it immediately speeds up again with the rapid &quot;The Needle Lies.&quot; The rest of the album is mostly steady, hard beats and rhythms, with a powerful ending song, &quot;Eyes of A Stranger.&quot; The best songs on the CD are probably &quot;Spreading the Disease,&quot; &quot;Eyes of A Stranger,&quot; &quot;Revolutiuon Calling,&quot; and my favorite Queensryche song, &quot;I Don't Believe In Love.&quot; Throughout the album, the band remains consistant in proving their lyrical genious, while showing off their musical talent. This is a great CD to listen to when you've got around an hour on your hands. It's also a great starter album for those who are oblivious to Queensryche. This is the CD that got me into their music, and now they are one of my favorite bands.<br />A must-buy.
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo & Stitch is the best movie Disney has made since The Lion King. Tarzan was very good, but it wasn't quite enough. But Lilo & Stitch shows us that finally Disney is on the right track again. I really do hope they make a Lilo and Stitch 2, and not just a direct-to-video release, but one we can actually see in the theater again. I saw this one twice, have the DVD as well.<br />My favorite character is Stitch by a long shot. He really makes the movie. And he has got the coolest little attitude! Haha, I'd like to BE Stitch! All the funny things he does make the movie very enjoyable, like hitting that dude in the face with a beach ball. Stitch does alot of things that are very mischievious, but fantastically funny. And while at first he appears to be very angry, he becomes soft and kind hearted, and learns to talk better by the end too. I dunno, I just can't say enough how much I love stitch. He is my fav Disney character, period, and always will be. <br />I've also been to Hawaii before and the way they drew the backgrounds is perfect. It's softer than the real colors of hawaii, but very close, and actually prettier if you ask me. Man I wish i could live in Stitch's world. that reminds me, I really would like to have a real stitch as a pet. He's perfect and I can't get enough of him!<br />See the movie, you'll really like it.

B000002C25|4.0|Oasis had come a short distance but crossed boundaries and were the kings of britrock that had crossed over and ruled America over the course of the summer of '96. The band packed their bags, trashed the tour and returned home and went straight into the recording studios to make the album they were dreaming about. Their very own White Album.<BR>Be Here Now is an example of a band that had pushed the envelope. A band that sits on top of the world and taking itself way to seriously. But why wouldn't they? Oasis have released two major number one hit albums back to back one year apart with 'Definitely Maybe' in 94, and 'What's The Story Morning Glory' in 95. Now it's 97, and Oasis had all the right to take advantage of their name, the equipment they had, and come out with one loud rocking bang!<br />Be Here Now opens up with Do You Know What I Mean which is the strangest sounding rock song ever released since The Beatles released Revolver. A cool song that marks Oasis' first experiment with the avant garde-ish sound that the other fab group before them ventured into. My Big Mouth is a loud hair raising rock tune. Liam's best vocals in years. One of the best tracks on Be Here Now. Magic Pie is Noel's first vocal duty on the album. A solid accoustic song that elevates into a hard rocker with Noel singing his heart out. Stand By Me is Oasis at their best. A low key rocking ballad that will make you want to fall in love. It's songs like these that really give Oasis their unique voice. I Hope I Think I Know is a punk rock song where the music is much better than ythe lyrics. Girl In A Dirty Shirt is Noel's bluesy ode to his then girlfriend Meg Mathews. Fade In/Out is the loudest song on the album. That scream in the middle comes as a surprise. Johnny Depp plays slide guitar on this song that sounds like a theme from a western movie at the very beginning. One of the album's highlights. Don't Go Away is what Oasis can do best. A Wonderwall-ish rock ballad. The most beautifultune on the entire album. This song can easily fit on Morning Glory. A rock classic. The Title track Be Here Now, which doesn't make sense at all, moves on by at flight speed but not hurting the album. Intended to be the Morning Glory of the album, and even though it fails it's still a not too bad song. All Around The World is where Oasis really push it. At 9 minutes, this has got to be the longest song I have ever went through. One of the album's highlights. A grand epic about peace on earth. More like a cry for help on the band's part. It's Getting Better Man sounds like it was recorded live. And that only makes it sound better man! The reprise at the end sounds unnecessary but for a White Album that had to be put in there. <br />On a Oasis level, this is their most overproduced, and over hyped album they ever released.<BR>But it grows on you like a fungus. The only reason that Oasis are still rocking big in the UK today is because they really know how to make good music and know how to cheer people up. Be Here Now will cheer you up. If it doesn't then you can do what Liam tells you to do in the title track ' flash your pan at the song that I'm singing' Whatever way you choose, thsi is a great album, not the greatest, but compared with the rest of the albums in the market, the greatest.

I don't get why so many people who reviewed this album on this site are saying that Amnesiac is a companion album to Kid A.<br />There is not even a guitar on Kid A until the fourth track, and the bass is not heard until the third track. Kid A is way more experimental. I see Amnesiac as more of a bridge between OK Computer and Kid A.<br />Don't get me wrong, I love Amnesiac. I just don't think you can call it a companion to Kid A.

B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K....what else can you say?? This album is for, about, and devoted to partying. I first discovered \\"party hard\\" on MTV, and I was amazed by this guy's devotion to his music, and of course, having fun. Each track, yes, does have its similarities to one another, but for some reason, that's why \\"I get Wet\\" is so good. It contintuously gets one into the mood for partying, and it's impossible to play it softly, without bobbing your head up and down. It's one of those albums that you and your friends never get tired of in the car on saturday night. \\"She is beautiful\\" is my personal favorite, but that's probably because i'm a girl. Special notice to \\"Girls own love,\\" and \\"I get wet,\\" as some of the most fun songs. This album is awesome, no other way to say it.

B000070WJE|5.0|Robbie is at his absolute best in this album!  Not only does he give us his signature tongue-in-cheek but also some deep feelings of what is going on in his life which makes him more real and more human.  Granted, this is totally different from any of his other albums (of which I own them all) but that is a statement about his music writing abilities.  He is not stuck in the same groove as other artists.  Having such a wide range of style is fantastic because it gives more listeners more opportunities to enjoy his music.  I hope this album which is full of catchy tunes (hot fudge) and poignant memories (nan's song) will be the one to break him here in the US because quite frankly I can't afford to buy tickets home to the UK every time I want to see him in concert (and let me tell you...one of the best concerts you will ever see in your life!).<br />I love this CD and every other CD Robbie has ever put out.  Give it a whirl and you won't be sorry!
B00006NSGX|3.0|One Car, One More Rider is Clapton's first live release since his highly acclaimed &quot;Unplugged&quot; Album which was released a little over 10 years ago.  This is a two CD release of back material including the acoustic &quot;Key To The Highway&quot; and the smooth jazz number &quot;Reptile&quot;.  Unfortunately, for guitarist, the songs sound just a tad bland as the emphasis seems to be on the vocals and the band.    &quot;Have You Ever Loved A Woman&quot; is probably the best track on the disc although, Clapton is equally in top form on two from his prior incarnation, &quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot;.  This is not Clapton's finest hour and hopefully not his last.
B000063CMK|2.0|I first became acquainted with Pain of Salvation after hearing some of the song \\"A Trace of Blood\\" on an internet radio station.  It sounded pretty good, and when I saw all those enthusiastic five-star reviews on this site I decided to check out \\"Remedy Lane.\\"<br />I downloaded the album and listened to it twice on MP3.  Here, in one word (albeit one rather long word), is my approximate reaction to \\"Remedy Lane:\\" AAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />To be fair, I do still think \\"A Trace of Blood\\" is an excellent song.  The vocals and lyrics are a tad melodramatic, but the playing is tight and the structure is interesting.  However, most of the rest of the album is [poor].  Sometimes it's even really [poor].  At times, it achieves the rare feat of being astonishingly, jaw-droppingly [poor].  The worst culprit is, without a doubt,  the stunning (and I mean that in the worst possible way) ballad \\"This Heart of Mine (I Pledge).\\"  The song is so sappy and overwrought it makes the Backstreet Boys sound like Suffocation!  Gildenlow's vocals on this song are absurdly high, and I don't mean a good kind of high like Geoff Tate or Rob Halford.  I mean more like an eight-year-old-eunuch kind of high (an acquaintance of mine who shall remain nameless used a different term, but it can't be published here because it contained naughty words).  Although \\"This Heart of Mine\\" is the most egregious offender here, it's not the only one.  Almost every song on \\"Remedy Lane\\" is dull, pretentious, and unnecessarily melodramatic.  Sure, the band can play, but with material this weak I don't really care.<br />Surely you can find some better music to spend your money on.  I'm not quite an authority on Dream Theater or Symphony X yet, but every album I've heard by those bands is vastly superior to this tripe in every single aspect imaginable.  \\"Karma\\" by Kamelot is another alternative.  It's a little schmaltzy, but if you like this album, then schmaltz obviously isn't a problem for you, and \\"Karma\\" at least contains some strong vocals and songwriting.  \\"Remedy Lane\\" isn't QUITE the worst metal album I've ever heard, but it's up there.problem for you, and \\"Karma\\" at least contains some strong vocals and songwriting.  \\"Remedy Lane\\" isn't QUITE the worst metal album I've ever heard, but it's up there.
B000002L82|4.0|What a wonderful album. &quot;Age of Consent&quot; ranks as one of the best songs of eighties alternative. The first time I've ever heard New Order was this album, so you could imagine how great the moment was when I heard the first seconds of &quot;Age of Consent.&quot; The song works in nearly every single possible way. Reminds me of &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart,&quot; and although it can't quite match the magic of that song... it sure comes close.<br />&quot;The Village&quot; has a pure, youthful feeling to it. It's a wonderful song that will stick in your head for days upon days.<br />The other standouts are &quot;Your Silent Face,&quot; &quot;5 8 6,&quot; and &quot;Leave Me Alone.&quot; &quot;Alone&quot; and &quot;Consent&quot; are more Joy Division than the future sound of New Order, but that's still fine.<br />It really annoys me that the overrated &quot;Blue Monday&quot; comes on this CD. It really, really interrupts the flow. &quot;The Beach&quot; is worthless, in a way. You might as well skip those ones.<br />If you put aside the obvious bad points (&quot;Blue Monday&quot; and &quot;The Beach&quot;), you'll have a wonderful, groundbreaking album here. Each song is original and it's own. Great music all around.
B00008438V|5.0|This is a great movie and glad to se the re-release.  Big blow to those trying to milk people for a copy of the dvd.  Two geeks manage to make a girl from a barbie doll and a computer.  A fine example of a coming of age comedy of the 80's.
B000003CMB|5.0|I've probably, over the years, opined as to this album before; however, having read the latest \\"reviews\\", I must again speak up. A previous reviewer wrote as to his love for Derek & The Dominoes ---I can't disagree at all; since early Motown, who, pray tell, has utilized \\"call and response\\" vocals better than Eric and Bobby Whitlock, on that particular album???? If I had my own band, THAT is what I would be trying to emulate. HOWEVER, all of that credit being deservedly given, the fact will ALWAYS remain that Duane Allman was the DRIVING force behind the \\"Layla\\" album, and (finally getting back to the subject) \\"At Fillmore East\\" was, and remains, THE quintessential SOULFUL rock album of all time!!! Complain about \\"jams\\" as much as you will. but could YOU ever maintain the musical / emotional dialogue that they managed?!?!? Could you scream / moan \\"The Blues\\" in ANY way that compares to the heartfelt pain and emotion that Gregg Allman emulates on this album?!?!? Can you, or any of your friends, trade riffs with the depth and truth that Duane and Dickey Betts did here?!?!? Who do you know that can walk / RUN a bass-line like Berry Oakley??? Trade percussion lines like Jai and Butch????? SORRY----pretend to be as much of a \\"technical' musicologist as you wish---it's just pretense and ego; music is emotion, and \\"At Fillmore East\\" is, and apparently will remain, the penultimate example thereof!!!'Nuff Said!!!!!!
B000066NW0|2.0|It's hard to figure out Avril Lavigne.  Maybe it's the confusion of her teenage years that makes her image and music so hypocritical.  Granted, there is a lot of potential shown in Let Go, but there's a lot left to be desired.  <br />There are a few things that stick out on this album.  First off, Avril really needs to \\"let go\\" of this anti-pop act that she's been playing for the past year.  We all can stick our middle fingers up Avril, you're not proving anything.  It's no secret that most of the people that she's selling records to are often the same ones that buy Britney Spears and N'SYNC.  This couldn't be anymore evident than in the lead single, \\"Complicated.\\"  The song is just as much bubblegum pop as Britney's music.  <br />There are some bright moments on this disc, though.  \\"I'm With You\\" is both lyrically and musically satisfying and shows Lavigne's real potential.  But fittingly, the 3 singles that were taken off of Let Go basically tell you everything about the album.  Every song lies somewhere in between them when it comes to quality and subject matter.  <br />Avril says that she's not going to be one of those one album superstars.  However, she is going to have to be able to come out with a more diverse album next time around.  A 16 year old girl complaining about guys .... and how the world is so cruel to an adolscent is fine for a while, but two to three years down the road we aren't going to want to hear it again.  Here's hoping for some much needed maturity into a promising star.
0446310786|5.0|I was gifted this book for Christmas and I have to say, it is one of the best books I have read so far. Ms Lee has a way of capturing your heart, so you don't ever want to put down the book.<BR>The story follows Jean Louise Finch, a.k.a. Scout. Scout narrates her life in the boring little County of Maycomb, Alabama. Life is good until her father, Atticus Finch, starts defending a black man against the accusation of rape of a white woman. Scout and her brother, Jeremy Atticus Finch, a.k.a. Jem, are teased a lot about it by both children and adults, for, at that time, whites were very much against blacks. Both Scout and Jem are going through a lot, for they are both growing up and, having no mother, life is a bit tough. In the mean time, a boy called Charles Baker Harris, a.k.a. Dill, comes to stay with a neighbor and the three become good friends. In this context, the story is about their whole lives and the wicked plans they come up with. In the end, Scout finds that, if you get to know a person, you always find they're very nice.<BR>This is one of those books that, when you finish reading, you just can't find the right words to describe it and it's so amazing that there are no words to describe it!  I have to congratulate Ms. Lee on her amazing book and her extraordinary talent for writing.<BR>I would recommend this book for people of atleast 12 years of age, for the language might not be understood by younger people. This book is good for people who want to just curl up in bed and read, read, read, till they can read no more. I guarantee more than just satisfaction to anyone who reads it!<BR>My only complaint is this: the book shouldn't ever finish! And, as a newspaper rightly quoted: \\"The reader will find immense satisfaction...and a desire, on finishing it, to start again on page one.\\"
0767803434|5.0|This movie is probably one the best 1990s Harrison Fords to come along in years. It's got everything that action fans need; action, suspense, and adventure. So, my advice is this; head out to the video store and buy this. I swear you will like it.
B000001E7L|5.0|...that comes as close to describing what I feel for this album! I purchased a copy of 'No Need to Argue' soon after it was released and after 'Zombie' had become such a great hit. I have been listening to it ever since, constantly and tirelessly. In the career of every great artist comes a time when s/he produces something extraordinary, so brilliant that it seems to have been the result of some divine inspiration. This album, seems to me, must have been composed in some state of epiphany! This is verse in music that encompasses various moods - pensive, angst-ridden, musing, nostalgic...and still there is a unity of thought and tone which binds all the songs. I think 'Zombie' is the best drum-based song ever composed. Fergal Lawler's genius with the drums has never been as brilliantly evident in any other song as much as it is in 'Zombie'. It's one of the most electric, head-banging and angst-ridden song I've ever heard! I also like the fact that Ireland is the subject of some of their songs. They convey their Irishness lyrically the way The Corrs convey theirs instrumentally. <br />The other songs from this album that I really like are 'Ode to my Family', 'Icicle Melts', 'Disappointment', 'Yeat's Grave'(ah, how I wish he'd been there to hear it...) and 'Daffodil Laments'. 'No Need to Argue' is I think The Cranberries at their best! It's no surprise that there are 5 songs from this album in their 'Best of...' album released recently. <br />This is one of THE Best albums ever composed by a band!
B000002NZO|5.0|I picked up this CD recently. I am truely surprised by the quality of the material of this 'not so popular' album. Prior to that I had a 'best of' and only one album (Selling England by pound by Genesis, which is offcourse superb and one of the best albums I own). I did not expected much from this CD just because in there are more acclaimed albums in their progreesive phase (Lamb lies down..., Foxtrot, Trick of a tail), but this is surprisingly good. I guess I have to get all those earlier (Progressive period) Genesis albums. <br />The song I liked the most is 'White Mountain', it has a strage tickling tune. I think it is very catchy too. The other tracks are almost equally good though. I can describe all the tracks but what's the use when you can explore those yourself. When the musicianship is concerned 'Selling England by Pound' was a better place than this but this is also a very well produced gem. <br />A (forgotten?) classic from Genesis.
0060005424|1.0|The first one was the best i loved it. When i found out there was a second book i jumped at the chance to buy it! I started it and could never finish it. I really liked Sabriel and her character but when i started Lirael i was like 'what is this!!' i hope the third book is better but i dont see much hope in it. Like a fool i will buy it since i have the other two and i MIGHT (notice the BIG might) get around to trying to read Lirael again, but i doubt it. I would not recommend BUYING this book. Read the first one, then BORROW the second. if u like it then buy it. but dont spend ur money right away. i dont think its worth it.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|The other day I was listening to the radio when the song \\"All The Things She Said\\" came on. This wasn't the first time I had heard the song, the moment the CD single came out for it I immediately bought it, but it was the first time I heard it being played on the radio. It made me so happy that these two brilliant girls, Lena and Julia, finally made it to mainstream music. Well done ladies! <BR>Onward with the CD itself...<BR>This CD has 11 tracks with 12 being a music video you can watch on your computer. The first one \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" is completely original. It's followed by two more great songs \\"All The Things She Said\\" and \\"Show Me Love\\". \\"How Soon Is Now\\" is my favorite and \\"Clowns\\" and \\"Malchik Gay\\" are also very lovable. This CD is worthy of your investment and hopefully, these two will go on tour soon.
B00006LSM3|4.0|\\"Brainwashed\\" is George Harrison's first studio album since 1987's \\"Cloud Nine,\\" and it is an EXCELLENT comeback album.  With fresh vocals, beautiful guitar work, great songwriting, and a new introduction to Harrison's ability to play the ukulele, \\"Brainwashed\\" is definitely one of his best albums.  The first single from the album, \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" does stand out on the album with his trademark slide guitar work, yet another catchy tune, and words that may bring a tear to your eye as he must have written it not long before his death.  Although I could write about every song on the album, you would pretty much hear the same thing over and over: great vocals, lyrics, guitars, etc.  Despite the album was released nearly a year after his death, it sounds exactly like the way Harrison would have intended it to sound (it was finished up by son Dhani and long-time friend Jeff Lynne).  This is a must-have for anybody that enjoys Harrison's music, and a great memory of him to have just after he had left this world.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I've seen a lot of reviews from people who hated this movie, This is a amazing film, regardless of what you think of the various philosophies espoused by the characters.  This movie isn't about preaching these ideas, though I can certainly see how it may come across that way to some people.  It's about creating something that looks and feels like a dream and letting it take you for a ride.  The visuals, the music, the randomness of each character, its the sum of the parts that makes it great.  For me, at least, it's far more emotionally stimulating than it is intellecutally, though I do find some of the conversation interesting.  If you hated this movie becuase of trendy pseudo-intellectualism, you're thinking way to hard about it.  Watch it again, and this time just sit back and allow yourself to experience the dream. I also must add that it was very cool seeing my dorm building and the Boat Car Guy.
B000005J56|4.0|a truly classic album that has introduced many listeners to the various Cuban rhythms. An excellent (perhaps better) companion is the first album from the Afro-Cuban All-Stars.
6304297912|1.0|It was...uh, different. The effects were bad on the baby on the ceiling scence, but what are you going to do about it? Ewan did play his role well but I must say his charactor was the most not the most likable. I suggest you skip this one..and maybe the 2nd on the is soon to be filmed.
0676973779|1.0|I read several critiques about this book before purchasing it. It is the most disappointing book I have ever read, largely because of my expectations from the hype it has received. I read it from cover to cover to be sure I wasn't missing the pearl in the oyster but it was a waste of my time.<BR>The cover of the book has a quote that I find ridiculous in light of the contents of the book. The quote is: &quot;wondrous storytelling that it may, as one character claims, make you believe in God&quot;. The book is boring, far-fetched drivel masquerading as fine literature.
B00004TL21|5.0|..<BR>i remember watching mtv late late at night a few years ago, when they didn't play poppy [stuff]and rap all the time, and the video for \\"change (in the house of flies)\\" by the deftones came on. completely honest, i didn't care for this song (still stands as maybe the weakest track on the record...although it has grown on me).<br />but then, awhile after i saw \\"change\\" but still awhile ago from now, i heard \\"back to school\\" on the radio station i was listening to and i thought it was a good song, more melodic than \\"change\\"...chino moreno has an amazing voice, it was soothing and erie in \\"change\\", and in \\"back to school\\" he showed you his intense screaming ability.<br />anyhow, about a year ago i was reading something online and the song \\"digital bath\\" was somewhere on the website, and because i was bored i decided to download it...i thought it was a cool name. turns out i fell completely in love with this song, so i started downloading other songs by them off of the white pony. i only downloaded maybe two other songs from the album before going out and buying the cd. at first i wasn't sure about some of the songs (this cd is actually pretty diverse...nice mix of hard and soft), but the more and more i listened, the more and more i couldn't stop listening...and it never gets old.<br />\\"knife prty\\" was my first fave; this song has a very interesting part in which there is intense guitar playing with someone screaming, not sure if it's chino or not, but it just flows so well, i really get into this song...anyway, then there's \\"feiticeira\\", which still remains my favorite...it's so original with interesting verses...very unique song that i just love. also, \\"passenger\\". when i heard maynard james keenan (tool, a perfect circle) singing along with chino on this track, it blew me away. keenan has an amazing voice, and his and chino's together.....wow. also, the very hard \\"elite\\" is such an adrenaline rush...great song. also, \\"pink maggit\\". its own slower song, but thenall of a sudden goes into a slower, (yet still hard) more drawn out, version of \\"back to school\\".<br />i think this album has something for everyone...\\"elite\\" being extreme, and \\"teenager\\" showing the softer side of deftones. if you liked \\"change\\", you'll love this album. if not (like me), you'll love this album. it's definitely in my top ten list, and has stayed there for a long time.
B000001DTM|5.0|One of the five best albums of the 1990s.  &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Wild Horses&quot; captures the best of the Joshua Tree-era band as it evolved into the &quot;new&quot; U2.  Even the weakest song (&quot;Acrobat&quot;) and the most overexposed (&quot;One, &quot;Even Better...&quot;) are still pleasurable to listen to.
B000069HK2|3.0|\\"Box Full Of Sharp Objects\\" and \\"Buried Myself Alive\\" are nice emo-core tracks, with screaming and soft guitar in both. \\"The Taste Of Ink\\" is a radio-friendly, slighty poppy, but still rather harmless track. The other songs are pretty much similar. Why 3 stars? The dude, the singer, Bert, has one of the most annoying voices ever. His melodic singing drills into your skull at times, it's so high-pitched and little-kiddish. The fact that the guy throws up on stage almost every show because of trying to scream doesn't prove anything except that he can't and shouldn't be screaming. Maybe if he could get his voice to crack and give up the screaming, the music would be better overall, because the guitar and bass and drums are nice and hard with plenty of punk energy and time changes. The drummer kicks majorly. It's not a bad CD, but the singing is really annoying. Some of the lyrics could use some improvement, and should be emphasized differently(like w/o screaming for instance). They're not bad, far from it, in fact. It just that they're not as wonderful as all the heaps of praise upon them are falsely indicating. Listen to Atreyu for a better overall presentation.
B000002PC6|5.0|Oh we all loved Olivia in the 'Physical' video. You remember, the sweatband, the leg-warmers, and the fat guys in the gym. What a time to be alive when the M in MTV stood for music.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This CD is by far the best SOAD album to date.  It is a variety of songs ranging from heavy to ballady.  The thought provoking roulette is a perfect example of System's diversity.  It is a purely acoustic song, just Serj and Daron singing and playing.  Good lyrics, good melody, nice little solo - something unexpected always good.  This album features many more solos from Daron than in the past and features the most political songs from the band to date.  They attack foreign policy, the justice system, and spending of government money just to name a few.  \\"Mr. Jack\\" is a great song that shows a new SOAD, an SOAD that can start with a melodic, almost creedlike guitar line, and end in a heavy, profanity laced yelling, that more than delivers the message of singer Serj - \\"F*** you pig!\\" he screams.  Regardless of their political stands or messages, there is little doubt that this band possesses talent more than worth the meager price of this album.  This is System at its best - pick it up and enjoy.<br />Personal Favorites -<BR>Chic'n Stu<BR>Boom!<BR>Mr. Jack<BR>Roulette<BR>Streamline<BR>Inner Vision
B00006G8O1|5.0|Donnie Darko  is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen, it keeps you in suspense and excitement the whole time and haunts you for days afterwards.  I watched it two times in a row and still I it left me wanting more.  It is interesting and cool, it all just clicks: the story, the cast, the filming and the soundtrack, which is terrific b.t.w.  Excellent setting the movie in 1988 it gives the film a completely different feel. Jake Gyllenhaal is also great as Donnie Darko and the character kind of reminded me of Haulden Caulfield in the catcher in the rye, the kind of kid that youd want to sit down with and talk to for ages.  The entire cast is actually very good, I loved the whole family and Beth Grant is perfect as the intolerable gym teacher: Kitty farmer, Patrick Swayze is also a very funny choice giving the movie an even better 80feel.  All in all it is just a very gripping, mysterious movie and the fact that it was filmed in only 28 days, the duration of the story it self is amazing. The words from one of the last songs in the movie stuck in my head and are still there: I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, the dreams in which I am dying are the best I have ever had.  I just want to say to everybody: WATCH DONNY DARKO THE BEST FILM EVER!
B00005JLS0|5.0|Hugh Grant plays billionaire businessman/playboy George and Sandra Bullock is his Greenpeace-loving attorney, Lucy. He breezes through life using people along the way, and when she gets tired of being used, she quits and gives two weeks notice. They spend a lot of time together in those two weeks and (of course) fall madly in love.<br /><br />Grant plays the same adorable, eyelash-fluttering character he always plays. He's very convincing as the oft-married spoiled brat who can't commit to anyone, even if he is noticeably getting older. Bullock never convinced me she was a Harvard grad or a lawyer. She seems to equate lack of make-up and scowling with liberalism and environmentalism, and generally looks unattractive and angry most of the time.<br /><br />The problem with this film is that neither George or Lucy change during the story. At the end, George is still immature and shallow and Lucy is still more interested in causes than relationships.  But I did enjoy watching Hugh Grant do what he does best.  If you love Hugh, you'll like the movie.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This is one of the greatest CD's ever and should be part of everyone's collection.
B000000993|4.0|In the last 10 years, Tool has produced only 3 full-length albums.  They are somewhat of an anomaly in hard rock; they take their time creating new music, but the time spent is worth the wait.  Their sound has become increasingly more refined over the years, with their recently released Lateralus being one of the most razor-sharp pieces of progressive rock I have heard.  Aenima is as impressive of an album as Lateralus, especially considering it was Tool's second full release, and a large improvement from their first, Undertow.<br />Undertow, when looked upon as a single release, almost as an album that exists outside Tool, is one of the better hard rock CDs of the early 90s, released at a time slightly after Nevermind, and before the commercial metal explosion of Korn in 1994.  It's brutal and succinct, lacking the lyrical ambiguity of later Tool albums, favoring more obvious, raucous words than Aenima and Lateralus.  <br />Undertow is a great album, but if you have heard Tool's other work, it is slightly under whelming.  Tool's progressive style is far from refined on this album, as certain tracks, notably \\"Bottom\\" and \\"Undertow\\", drag on for nearly 7 minutes, lacking the sound which made 8 minute tracks like \\"Eulogy\\" and \\"The Grudge\\" seem so natural on later albums.  It's as if they had a good idea how to compose 5 minute-plus songs, but not the experience to do it yet.  That is why Aenima is such an amazing piece of work; they nailed the progressive rock sound on every song of that album, but on their previous CD, only a couple years before, they struggled to make a similarly long track flow as well.<br />Even though some of the songs on this album drag a bit, it can't be denied how great they are, regardless of their sloppiness.  \\"Bottom\\", even with Henry Rollins' embarrassing mumblings, is a stirring song, and better than many released at the time.  \\"Sober\\", \\"Swamp Song\\", and \\"Prison Sex\\" are classics.  Although Tool produced far superior albums over time, Undertow, on its own, is a great album, even with its rough edges and slightly unrefined progressive sound.  Those who are new to the band will be very impressed; those who have heard all their other music before this will still enjoy it, albeit with a bit of disappointment.
B00006AFUR|5.0|As an electronics employee at Target, I regularly see many artists that are \\"up and coming\\" on our TV and to be honest, nearly all of them [are]really bad.  When I first heard the single on our network, \\"Capricorn\\", I'll be honest I hated it, but over a course of a week, it really began to grow on me.  Because I am a guitarist, I tend to focus on the guitar parts in songs and in this song, I felt that the guitar work was [not very good].  Over this time, however I began to listen to the work that goes on besides the guitar and realized how deep the music is.  Layers of bass, doubled guitars, great drums, and most of all highly developed lyrics and vocals make up the total product.<br />And just for the record, I had no idea that Jason Lito was involved with this band at all and to be honest, didnt even really know who he was.  I still haven't seen any movies beyond fight club with him in them, but if his song writing and vocal abilities are any reflection of his acting abilities, then he must be a [good] actor.<br />Bottom line, buy this album, it sounds like nothing you've heard before and this is a good thing.  It drags in no areas on the album although my personal favorite song is definitely \\"Bhudda for Mary\\", the depth of the lyrics and the melody incorporated in the song are just incredible.  Its incredible to me that Jason wrote all these songs, minus the drums single handedly.  (His brother Shannon recorded the drums.)  This man has a clear vision in his song writing and writes some of the most thought provoking and melodious songs of the day, while still retaining a heavy edge.
B00001QEG5|5.0|A good album but a different lyrical approach.  At this point TS had made their success with Stay Hungry in 1984 but with the success of TS came the loss of Dee Snider's inner-fire of angry youth that was the lyrical inspiration for Stay Hungry, and Come Out and Play.  Now a success Dee focused the bands direction into romance rock, with his wife Suezette as an inspiration, the approach was like a \\"Def Leppard\\" type love-rock music which tho great to listen to and not sappy like other love songs but was an ultimate betrayal to their \\"angry-youth\\" fan base.  Even Mark Mendoza was ticked at Dee for his decision and resentful for a long time.<br />Another thing that did this album in before its time was the fact MTV gave them no other airplay after \\"I Wanna Rock\\" deeming \\"Be Chrool to Your Scuel\\" too grotesque, basically a zombies in school video with a \\"Thriller\\" feel.  Then after that no videos were shown on MTV for \\"Love is For Suckers.\\"<br />All their early 1970s stuff thru the 1980s was all hard rocking material done well, the 70s material was anti-disco and songs about quirks in life, from 1980-85  angry youth, sports chants and stadium rock hits, 1987 success, loss of inner \\"anger-fire\\"<BR>on Dee's part but not a loss of inspiration and creativity on this album.  We see how Dee combines love-lyrics with heavy-metal.  Different subject but still the same TS style.<br />If you have a girlfriend who's into Def Leppard rock this would be a great CD for her.<br />1987 and 1988 the whole RAP scene was coming into play, along with many artists betraying what made them famous, which is why, sadly, I never bought the tape in 1987, Van Halen and Quiet Riot were broken-up, and ballad rock dominated what little hard-rock was being played on MTV, so at the time I didn't want to risk it however since listening to the samples at CD Now I have found it to be as great as everything else they have done and I now own the CD.<br />I've done this with Stryper, Joan Jett, Poison, & Blondie other talents that lost the spotlight to the Rap genre in the latter 1980s.<br />Personally Mark shouldn't have been so bitter towards Dee.  There were many other factors denying the public the rock consistency of the early 1980s.  Genre change, new politics at MTV, and then the scapegoat status of what was wrong with rock.  A sad promotion but a great album.  Had this been promoted right TS would've been up there with Def Leppard, Led Zepplin, and Poison.<br />The album ROCKS and is a must for any fan.
0553275976|5.0|This book is one of the most enjoyable books that I've read. With great characters and descriptions, it is definetely a masterpiece.<br />The characters in the novel are downright brilliant. Each has his or her flaws, and Wolfe shows those, but not with too much severity, instead showing that we are all equal in our flaws.<br />The description in this book, though sometimes too much, too long, and repetitive, is generally very good and paints a beatiful picture of the scene in your mind.<br />The plot is very involved, but not so much that it confuses you, and more than enough to keep you interested. The ending is very surprising and very riveting, and is a perfect ending to a already great book.<br />Highly recommended to all.
B00006G8LB|5.0|I loved this movie!! Tobey Maguire makes a perfect Peter Parker, and Kirstin Dunst is great as Mary Jane. I was surprised that it was more than just a superhero comic flick. Watch this movie... I'm sure you'll love it!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Last week I saw &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; at the theatre and &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; caught my ear in the soundtrack.  I sat through the credits and &quot;discovered&quot; Norah Jones.  I rushed out and bought the CD - and it is totally superb!  Now I'm hooked and have to have more. Her husky, sensual sound reminds me of an early Peggy Lee - but different enough to be uniquely herself.  I have been a jazz/blues fan for 50 years, and this is definitely among the best I've ever heard.  I want to hear more and learn more about Norah. I'll look forward to seeing her live.
B000069HKH|4.0|I liked this album, but it is very different from Bruce's classic stuff.  He seems to have abondoned a formula that was his own for something that is more mainstream and less like his classic style.  These songs seemed forced into the same mass produced form that makes most modern music sound exactly alike, and in most cases, worthless and meaningless.  I know this might sound cheesy, but his old music from albums like greetings from Asbury Park and Darkness on the edge of town were amazingly unique and even had a better sound (not to mention much deeper meaning and emotion) because they had Bruce's style all over them. The songs did not follow a redundant pop pattern and they were recognizably different. Overall, this album is pretty good, it has some good songs and catchy tunes, but i feel it is a bit forced and it certainly deviates from Bruce Springsteen's distinctive and creative writing style.
0201633612|5.0|I read this book and then realized I have been using &quot;patterns&quot; for years, I just did not know that they had names.<br />That said, this book is a difficult read for anyone that is not an expert level software designer. It borders on being TOO much theory and academia to be under stood.<br />Every intermidiate to junior level programmer/developer I have introduced this book to gave it back to me and said they did not understand a thing in the book.<br />After an explaination on how to read it and some concrete examples they said it made a &quot;little&quot; more sense after 3 or 4 more reads.<br />Not for the faint at heart, but everyone considers it to be the &quot;bible&quot;
0767830555|5.0|Great directing and great acting.  Robert Deniro is awesome.  One of his best works.
0375414053|4.0|At the age of 30 and not yet a mother, I spend lots of time with friends discussing our fears of how in the world we'll balance motherhood with a full-time job (we can barely manage just the job now). This book was a quick and entertaining read that gave me a glimpse of the craziness I have to look forward to. Like Bridget Jones, it had me laughing out loud many times. Unfortunately, the ending was a bit of a disappointment. I had the feeling the author tried a series of endings and ultimately landed on this one for lack of anything more interesting.
B00007GZR5|4.0|As a complete film 'What Dreams May Come' fails to meet criteria that critics tend to expect. While the plot is pedestrian it still works on a visceral and metaphoric level. The dialog is frequently mundaine to manipulative, yet isn't that part of the movie going experience? Can't something be interesting without being profound?<br />For me the answer is yes, not every film needs to be profound. Sometimes I just want to be entertained and that can be in a number of ways. Another negative, the score detracts because it is so obvious, yet with all of these problems I sat through the film in awe and bought into the idea of a person's will to make things right. It's archetypal drama that dares to be positive in a time where ambigious and tragic films or mindless comedies that rely on shock value and often ugly humor seem to be all the rage.<br />The acting is very good, Robin Williams doesn't mug his way through the part as some have implied. Some backlash could be the 'nice guy' syndrome around his previous and even future films. If you identify with that issue you'll not enjoy what is a multifaceted performance.<br />Any film that can get me to suspend disbelief even in poorly scripted moments does something right and in this case there are several positives to mention. <br />The set design and lighting are dazzling. The realization of living your own reality is the films strongest suit because the design flawlessly creates the various worlds in What Dreams May Come.<br />Besides the great, oscar winning visual effects the casting is excellent with enough genuinely surprising moments to keep suspense while developing the slender plot. Cuba Gooding Jr. does great work as a guide in heaven or wherever you care to call it. As an actor he has learned to become whatever the character requires without overacting.<br />While a moody, even sombre film, What Dreams May Come is visually arresting with solid acting that makes a hackneyed Hollywood script emotionally satisfying and even gives you something to think about.<br />Although not a 5 star film, What Dreams May Come still satisfies in terms of entertainment. The DVD is as vibrant as the film and has interesting extras.
B000002HMH|5.0|There are two sides to Metallica: The thrash metal Metallica before 1990 which was really fast riffed songs and very fast lyrics. After 1990 Metallica released &quot;Metallica&quot; with their new producer BoB Rock (which is an amazing album too) and their songs became much slower and shorter, but the lyrics are somewhat better. Anyways, there a lot of good songs on this cd including It Ain't my B**ch, House that Jack built, hero of the day, king nothing and two songs that are said to be two of the best songs metallica ever made: Bleeding me, and Outlaw Torn, which are two amazing songs. Metallica didn't stop doing thrash metal as there are still a couple of songs on Load that are pretty fast. Overall, this cd is awsome. i've bought this cd 2 weeks ago, and I've listened to it everyday since then and ain't getting bored of it. GO BUY IT!!
B000021XS0|5.0|Just when I thought progressive rock couldn't get any more bombastic or complicated, Dream Theater comes along and raises the bar once again. I haven't heard a concept album this intense since Pink Floyd's The Wall or Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime. Being a drummer myself, Mike Portnoy certainly commands my resepect with some of the most intense and articulated drumming I have ever heard. The whole band just gels together beautifully. John's guitar solos never fail to dissapoint, and he continues his shredding ways on this album. It's a breath of fresh air to hear a band as musically talented as these guys are in a sea of cookie cutter bands that only seem to know a few noisy, heavy riffs and little else. This album, music and lyrics envellops me in a way that few albums have ever done. Kudos to DT, keep up the good work!
B00000348D|5.0|I think the reviewer jdp missed all the points on this LP and what does structure or melody have to do with anything, especially in art...does anyone know that Ornette brought written out charts for his players (band) to use on most of his recordings and practice sessions...note for note improvizations played like any Ellington score...all art has substance like a hammer on a nail...if it hadn't been for Coleman, Ayler, Shepp, Kirk, Coltrane and Dolphy we would all be Republicans and sitting in a Civic Center Concert Hall listening to predictable melodic dead ends...in fact, all jazz we hear today that is exciting is anything other than a WM trumpet solo...the sources today come from the above Gang Of Six a 100 to 1...jazz would have been dead in the 1970's if Ornette hadn't recorded at least once...if you can't see the tones or harmonics in &quot;Free Jazz&quot; you must be deaf and what would Zorn, Shipp, Vandermark, Berne, Evan Parker, Derek Bailey, Peter Brotzmann, Mark Ribot, Nels Cline, Sonic Youth, Haino, Buckethead, Bill Laswell, Dave Holland, Tony Williams, Miles Davis (of course Williams and Davis are gone),  Bill Frisell, David Byrne, Dave Douglas, Julius Hemphill, Anthony Braxton, Keith Jarrett, Enten Eller, David Ware, Billy Bang, etc be doing right now if someone with guts hadn't opened up the gates...hip or not, who cares...it really doesn't take all that much work to listen to Ornette's ride to the moon...I think &quot;Free Jazz&quot; is a must have along with Duke Ellington's &quot;Newport 1956&quot;.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I caould watch this movie forever^.^ I watched it before reading the book &amp; it helped me picture the characters &amp; Hogwarts vividly as I read the book. Visual aide's not the only thing the movie does for the book. If you watch it before reading it, it makes the book funnier &amp; more surprising.<BR>     I did the exact opposite on the 2ed movie by reading the book first, but then after watching the movie I had to read the book again. <BR>      The movies were very well made with great casting, great acting, great special effects, &amp; great scenery. I couldn't enjoy Quidditch better any other way^.^
B000003TA4|5.0|Their crazy fans, the british invasion they started, their legendary career spanning \\"I want to Hold your Hand\\" to \\"Let it be\\" and everything inbetween. Yes, who else but the Beatles. We have yet to see anything or anyone like that since 1970 and the release of the Beatles final album. But I think that we may have missed the band that could have been the next Beatles. Nirvana put out 6 albums before the tradgedy of Kurt Cobain's death (not including their so-called \\"greatest hits\\" package) and only 3 of them were actual studio records, only 2 of them had Dave Grohl. This is Nirvana's first real album, and I would say that there has never been any record better. Hopefully you have heard the song \\"You know You're right\\", a song that proves Nirvana was far from done after the release of \\"In Utero\\". <BR>     This album features songs like \\"Smells like Teen Spirit,\\" the anthem of the 90's, \\"Come as you are\\" a slow song as far as Nirvana is concerned but defintley great, \\"Lithium,\\" my personal favorite song ever, and more. Every song is a burst of emotion and revolutionary guitar licks, so much so that you would think it was a greatest hits album if you didn't know better. R.I.P Kurt Cobain.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Anyone who says Journey is not Journey without Steve Perry should give this DVD a fair listen. The whole band sounds great! And while Steve Augeri can (and does) do a great job on the &quot;old stand-bys&quot;, he proves also that he has his own voice and contribution to the band. <br />All the stuff you ever wanted to hear at a Journey concert is here: Open Arms, Lights, Separate Ways, Faithfully (my own personal favorite), as well as the rarely heard La Raza del Sol and a few (too few!) numbers from their 2000 release, Arrival.<BR>The whole band sounds great: longtime members Neal Schon, Jonathan Cain and Ross Valory, and new boys, Augeri and Deen Castronovo. This is Journey as good as they ever were- and ready to get even better!<br />The DVD itself is great- terrific sound, well done!<br />Get it! Watch it! Love it! Love Journey!

B000002UAF|5.0|A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is one of my favorite BEATLES CD's to listen to. Maybe its because I enjoy watching the DVD and watching the band play the songs. But only half the songs are from the movie. I just like hearing IF I FELL, I'M HAPPY JUST TO DANCE WITH YOU, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, CANT BUY ME LOVE, AND I LOVE HER. Like I said, its probably watching the movie and being able to have a visual when I listen to these songs, this was way before MTV and of course this was before I was even born. Besides the songs that are from the movie, we also have songs that are albe to stand on their own such as ANY TIME AT ALL, THINGS WE SAID TODAY, YOU CANT DO THAT, I'LL BE BACK. I think that every song that is here is a great song and deserves to be in your collection. I also recommend that you buy the DVD and along with this CD they are a great combination.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I simply love this cd.  The lyrics take you to a different era, and the beat, the parralellism between the bass and the guitar is magnificent.  But the best part is Julian's voice.  Truly enchanting.  This cd rates #1 in my book:)
B00005N9CV|4.0|i love diana krall.  her voice are just beautiful, not perferct, but the kind that can really moves you.  i always think that a jazz voice should not be perferct.  krall's is just right,  smooth and remind you of old times.  <br />&quot;the look of love&quot; is good record.  her interpertation of &quot;the look of love&quot; is just as good as dusty springfield's (though springfield's breaks are better).but i don't really like the new direction she is taking, (big rchestra, large sound).    i still perfer her old simple style, with just her piano, add some drum, bass and her voice.  her &quot;love scent&quot; still remains her best recording so far.<br />for the same songs on this cd, i like her performance better in her dvd &quot;live in paris.&quot;  in which she really shows her beautiful vocal.
B000001ES9|5.0|If I was mortally wounded tomorrow, my last words would be \\"At least I heard the first from Rush.\\"  This is one of those rock albums that defines the very reason why I love rock in the first place.  From beginning to end, with not a single note, a single scream, a single moment of sheer sonic bliss out of place and time, this record captures an era, eludes typecasting, and infuses life in this genre with everlasting energy.  <BR>  There are those who might be reading this review right now who are stunned to see someone write the words \\"eludes typecasting\\" in reference to this album, but let me explain why: yes, Led Zeppelin comes to mind throughout the songs.  Yes, I'd understand if someone said they're a rip-off of Page and Plant's diamond-plated sound.  I'd even understand if someone said that this CD is a weak comparison to their later progressive evolutions.  But bear this in mind, Rush's first album is great because it's pure.  Unlike Zep's music, there's no political stance being posed here.  Unlike Zep's songwriting, there's no story being told here.  Unlike Zep's bluesy undercurrent, there's no blues here.  <BR>   \\"Rush\\" is a strain of madness in music that explodes forward with \\"Finding my Way.\\"  Even though it was released in '74, something about \\"Rush\\" sounds indefineably ahead of its time, like it could have been recorded and released in '84 instead.  And let's face it - the years between 1973 and 1985 are an era of classic rock that celebrates this sound.  \\"What You're Doing\\" slams to an unpredictable and satisfying close, something modern rock acts have forgotten how to do altogether.  And \\"Working Man\\" . . . well, let me devote a paragraph to working man.<BR>    \\"Working Man\\" is a masterpiece.  It begins loudly but subtly, and the lyrics say nothing more or less than exactly what comes out of Geddy Lee's mouth - \\"They call me a working man/I guess that's what I am.\\"  And incredibly, he sings it without sounding resigned, and no, the helium pitch of his voice is not the reason why.  Lee sounds like he is rejoicing in the band's momentarily clear and lucid self-definition. And it's the resounding blast of the guitars, the smashing of drums, and the masterfully original ending (echoing with stronger intent the ending of \\"What you're Doing\\") that backs him up and makes this song a tight ending to a tight CD.<BR>    Don't miss out.  Buy this one.
B000002UB3|5.0|I will admit, I am only starting to really give the BEATLES their due, me being a huge STONES fan. Now I will admit that I know the hits, but I am starting to really give them a listen to and finding out why they really mattered in terms of musical history. ABBEY ROAD is a truly great album that should be in every music fans collection. George Harrison has on this album two of the greatest songs that he ever wrote SOMETHING, HERE COMES THE SUN. Ringo contributes with his pretty good song OCTOPUS'S GARDEN. Of course we have John and Paul going back and forth singing the rest of the album. Besides the songs mentioned above we have the classic COME TOGETHER, also helping make the first half of the album killer are MAXWELL'S SILVER HAMMER, OH! DARLING, I WANT YOU(SHE'S SO HEAVY, YOU NEVER GIVE ME YOUR MONEY. Other songs that I like on this album are SHE CAME IN THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW, SUN KING, POLYTHENE PAM,and the medley of GOLDEN SLUMBERS/CARRY THAT WEIGHT/THE END. If you are a true fan of great rock 'n' roll music, then you must have this CD in your collection. I can say that I trul enjoy listening to this album.
B00000AFDW|1.0|Just when you think KISS can't get any lower, they sell you Psycho Circus. Simply put, I enjoyed last years root canal more than this CD. We, as KISS fans, deserve this shoddy product because we don't walk away from these jerks. Clearly we should have moved on after Unmasked, but nooooooooooooooo, we foolishly think KISS will get better, here's proof that they won't, can't, refuse or simply are unable to recapture the music from their early lp's.
B00004RF9G|5.0|When I first rented BRIGADOON from the public library last spring, I immediately fell in love with it.  Just added the DVD to my collection yesterday.  It is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  It is a 1954 film adaptation of the 1947 Broadway musical.  The Lerner and Loewe score is one of the greatest ever written for the stage (or screen).  The great cast includes Gene Kelly, Van Johnson, and Cyd Charisse.  Although certainly not the greatest singers in the world, Kelly's and Johnson's singing is more than adequate and is really quite lovely.  Charisse's singing voice is dubbed for this film, and she works great as well.  <br />When Brigadoon made the transition from Broadway to Hollywood, a good chunk of its score was dispensed with in order to make room to highlight the dancing abilities of its stars.  This is, in fact, where many people find fault with this film; the lack of the rest of the Broadway score.  To these people, I have this to say... ---This movie is not the Broadway play.  It is a **film adaptation.**---   This is also the common complaint about MGM's \\"Show Boat\\" from 3 years earlier.  Another common complaint about \\"Brigadoon\\" is that it was obviously shot in soundstages on the MGM lot in Culver City instead of the highlands of Scotland.  This was due to the fact that producers were working with smaller budgets than they had been just 3 or 4 years earlier.  This, coupled with the unpredictable weather in the British Isles, necesitated that the film be shot at the studio.  This is also evident in \\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\\" from the same year.  Although the sets are obviously painted backdrops, they are nicely done and work well.  IMO, they do not demerit the film.<br />Brigadoon more than makes up for the missing songs by adding some spectacular dance numbers.  \\"Heather on the Hill\\" is one of the most sweeping dance numbers I have ever seen in any film.  Kelly's and Charisse's gracefulness really hits the spot.  <br />I HIGHLYRECOMMEND the DVD, with its lush color, clear picture, and stereo sound.  If you haven't seen \\"Brigadoon,\\" you should see it.  At the very least for some of the greatest dance numbers you will ever see.
B000002UAO|5.0|RUBBER SOUL is a good album that I had to listen to after hearing how it is possibly the best studio album the BEATLES ever recorded. I also was curious  because it  has ranked so high on every greatest albums of all time list. After hearing it, I can say that I am not disappointed. The album has a folkish tinge to it that the group pulls off quite well. Now this album came out before they started doing all their studio experimentation and what we have here are great songs that showcase  the bands talents. Ringo shines on WHAT GOES ON, George shines on THINK FOR YOURSELF  and IF I NEEDED SOMEONE. Of course John and Paul are at their usual greatness. Standout songs from the album are GIRL, DRIVE MY CAR, NOWHERE MAN, MICHELLE, THE WORD, NORWEGIAN WOOD, I'M LOOKING THROUGH YOU, IN MY LIFE. The group on this album showed a maturity to their music and it really shows. This was a springboard to what would come from the band in the future. I highly recommend this album for any serious music fan to add to their collection.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|I THINK T.A.T.U IS THE BEST GIRL GROUP EVER! Their lyrics say so much and their music just makes u get up and shake your booty. I think u should defenetly check their CD out, you will not be disappointed.
B00005QZ82|2.0|It's entertaining, if you're able to really suspend your sense of reality.  It was really hard to fall for Kevin Kline's character the way you needed to, in order to really feel the compulsion she has to stay with him.  The ending was a bit strange, as though they just ran out of things to do.  All in all - rent this first or buy it used, it's not worth full price.  Grab Notting Hill instead.
B00005QIPH|4.0|OK let me start off by saying i like this cd a LOT- but as i listen to it more and more the songs kind of start to melt into eachother and theres a few of them that i cant really tell apart- sure there are songs like last nite that differ greatly from everything else but teh first two songs just dont sound THAT different- its usually the same chords- i dnno, maybe i just haven't listened to it enough but overall- its a great cd and its worth buying
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is my personal opinion about the quality of this album, which is more POP ROCK than the Russian album which is more DANCE POP:<br />1. Not gonna get us: If you like Pop, Rock and \\"THE MATRIX SOUNDTRACK\\" kind of songs, then this one may be your favourite. The song tell us a story about a forbidden love, and how the 2 girls will continue with it, doesn´t matter what can happen, \\"They are not gonna get us!!\\" Really good one. 9 of 10. <br />2. All the things she said: The main reason to buy this album, the best song in it. One of my best songs ever TOP TEN. The best one. 10 of 10. <br />3. Show me Love: It starts with a phone call, in Russian, then with a slow and soft beginning charms you, it continues with one of the coolest chorus ever heard: \\"SHOW ME LOVE, SHOW ME LOVE, TIL I OPEN THE DOOR, SHOW ME LOVE, SHOW ME LOVE, TIL I AM READY FOR MORE\\". Really cool. 9.5 of 10.<br />4. 30 minutes: In how much time can pain kill you???, How much time does it take to forget pure and true love???, How much blood is it needed for true love to be free???. This is my favourite song, sad, melancholic and powerful song. Definetly one of the best ballads ever, and one of their singles, you´ve got to see the video, it is amazing as well. 10 of 10.<br />5. How soon is now: You are not dreaming, if you like the Charmed TV SHOW Openning, then this is your song, if you don´t it doesn´t matter you are going to love it anyway. It is the same song than the TV Show, the only difference is that this one really rocks!!!!. 9 of 10.<br />6. Clowns (Can you see me now): Are you ashamed of what these two girls are doing???, They don´t even care, this song tells us what Lena and Yulia think about those ones who always critize and talk about them. It doesn´t matter if you are straight or not, I am straight and believe me this song talks about forbidden love. If you love someone, then don´t care if \\"CLOWNS ARE AROUND YOU\\". Because pure and true love is simply that. 9.5 of 10.<br />7. Malchick Gay: If you like Dance, Trance, Electronic or any kind of this music styles then this one will be your favourite song. Tender and soft song, really good one. 9.5 of 10.<br />8. Stars: One of the coolest song of the CD, probably the 4th best of the album. The Russian chorus make it more than special, it makes it unique. It talks about desillution and the end of love. 9.5 of 10.<br />9. Ya Shosla S Uma: \\"All the things she said\\" in Russian, actually it should be \\"I´ve lost my mind\\". Whether if you know Russian or not, doesn´t matter if you don´t get a word, this song is the best, can´t denny it, can you???. 10 of 10.<br />10. Nas Ne Dagonyat: I love this song in Russian, in English it is \\"Not gonna get us\\". It is 10 times better in Russian than in English. The chorus sounds much better. 10 of 10.<br />11. Show me Love (EXTENDED): This version is the 2nd best song of the album, it is really amazing, it doesn´t matter your sexual preferences, this song talks about love, my girlfriend loves it, I do too. 10 of 10.<br />12. All the things she said video and Interview: Well, we must admit that Yulia and Lena don´t speak too much English, but it really doesn´t matter, because they really rock singing!!!!!. Yulia is really sexy!!!, Lena too. 20 of 10. The best POP ROCK video of the year!!!!!!!!.
B000002MFN|5.0|The greatness of this album is overshadowed. Unfortunately for Madonna, she received alot of bad publicity in the promotion with this album which was released around the same time as her 1992 Sex book and the box office flop \\"Body of Evidence\\" film. Aside from the title track, there's only one other sexually charged song called \\"where life begins\\" and by today's standards of what is on the radio, the songs are relatively tamed. She does some of her finest work here which rates right up there with \\"like a prayer\\" and \\"Ray of light\\". Though the album is entitled \\"erotica\\", its really far from it. The album is jam packed with dance music (\\"Deeper & Deeper\\", \\"Bye Bye Baby\\", the peggy lee classic \\"Fever\\", etc...), a little bit of hip hop (\\"Waiting\\"), classic Madonna ballads (\\"Rain\\", \\"Bad Girl\\", etc...) and there's even a song about a good friend of hers lost to AIDS called \\"in this life\\". The album is full of tracks that go on a journey from finding love, losing it, losing yourself, and rediscovering yourself again, sexuality, sensuality, and gaining strength through tough times...all combined with a wicked sound that'll keep you tuned in from the beginning to the end of the cd. This is a work of art that needs to be recognized as not only a classic of the 90s but of every music era! Ignore the bad publicity and remember that the MUSIC is what keeps Madonna on top, and she still shines with this record.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD is by far the best I have heard this year.  What an amazing voice!  This has opened my eyes to a whole new music genre.
B00000IREA|3.0|If you want to see an intellectual sci-fi film, this is NOT it! Jane Fonda stars as the queen of the galaxy, Barbarella and its just a fun, campy film in outer space with bizarre flesh eating dolls, an orgasm-maker machine, and a bunch of horny people. The images in the film are cool to watch and I think its enjoyable for those that enjoy campy movies like \\"Flash Gordon\\" or the 70s Wonder Woman series. I'm not sure why the DVD has an \\"R\\" rating because the VHS I have is a PG. I think it fits more with a PG-13 because of the sex stuff that kids probably wouldn't understand (orgasm machine, etc...) but definitely NOT \\"r\\" rated. You'll be disappointed if you're looking for \\"R\\" rated material.
0345350499|5.0|A fair warning to anyone who reads this: Although it's a sort of retelling of the tale of King Arthur, it most definantly doesn't stick to the book. That being said...<BR>    The Mists of Avalon is an epic 800+ page tale spanning three generations and around 70 years (although it's not specified in the book). It focuses on the women of Camelot, who were the people who really held up the throne. Old and loved characters are given a new twist. Morgan, the heroine of the story, is known as Morgaine, and isn't an evil witch but a faithful follower of the pagan religion. She doesn't want to bring Arthur down, in fact, it's her job to keep him on the throne by forcing him to hold on to the pagan ways. Guenevere, the villian, is known as Gwenhwyfar, a pious and well-meaning (but uneducated and naive) Christian who is set on convincing Arthur to turn his pagan kingdom to the Christian ways, which would ultimatly cause his downfall from Morgaine's point of veiw. Mordred, the villian of the original Arthur legends, is merely a confused young man born from Arthur's marriage to Avalon with his sister Morgaine, who is corrupted by his foster mother, Morgause. In this story, the men are merely veiwed as pawns. Lancelet a hopeless romantic who turns away from his love affair with his cousin Morgaine to court the fair and lovely Gwenhwyfar. Arthur is a front for Avalon, merely there to keep the pagan land from sinking into the mists. But the strongest characters come from Avalon; the Lady of the Lake Vivian, her apprentice, the old Merlin Talesin, his daughter Nimue, the deceitful new Merlin Kevin, and more. These characters are the ones that give the novel it's dark and enchanting feel.<BR>    I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone who's a devout Christian, because of how it favors paganism. The book is also filled with questions as to how ethical Christianity is, which to not-so-religious people like me proved to be very interesting. The books also has a few graphic sex scenes,so it's not for the sqeamish. But all in all, the elements come together to form a truly amazing story that you'll never forget.
0385508417|5.0|I'm not a real big book reader, but this one was small and was by a well known author so I thought I'd get it to have something to read while riding on vacation.  I couldn't put it down.  It was soooo funny.  I read the whole thing on my trip back from Florida to SC.  I'm sure the normal readers of the author were a little surpised and taken back by this different setting.  But I<br />absolutely loved it.
B00005JL78|2.0|Minority Report was produced by Dreamworks SKG, which is run by the three most powerful men in Hollywood (Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen), and it has a very over-rated but somehow extremely popular movie star in it (Tom Cruise) so you would think it would be a big-budget blockbuster, but this is not the case at all.  In Minority Report, We are expected to believe that Washington DC in the year 2054 is a very clean and sterile metropolis, with no run-down buildings or graffiti on the walls.  Precrime, the department that uses genetically-gifted \\"Pre-cogs\\" is entrusted with arresting murderers before they kill.  The pre-cogs look like every other alien in Spielberg's movies (most noteably AI), and Tom Cruise is always shown running around with very little meaning or purpose to his actions.  The ending was weak and predictable, and it was WAY too long, considering it was a very mediocre movie
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is the best CD i have ever bought! I love it and highly recommend it!
B000063S6Z|4.0|Yes, I love Moby. I loved Moby, Everything is Wrong, Animal Rights, Ambient and Play. This album is just Play all over again, but that's not really a bad thing in my opinion.<BR>I enjoyed this album from start to finish, especially 'We Are All Made of Stars', 'In This World', 'Fireworks', and the Bodyrock-ing 'Jam for the Ladies'.<br />In short, if you liked Play, you should buy this album.

If you follow reading Eckhart Tolle's \\"The Power Of Now\\" with also reading Norman Thomas Remick's \\"West Point: Character Leadership Education...\\", you will acquire confidence through philosophical KNOWLEDGE. If you acquire knowledge, you will acquire happiness. IF.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The video quality on this thing is amazing.  If you like crisp images, get this.  The story is also quite funny; basically I agree in other respects with the other reviewers.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Spider-Man is a really good movie if you ask me.  I went to see it twice and got the DVD the day it came out.  It's a great film.  Tobey Maguire plays a good Spiderman.  He's pretty dorky as Peter Parker, but that makes him seem even more unlikely to be a super hero, which makes it so great.  The first fight scene, when Peter is fighting with that guy, Flash, is really well done, especially when Maguire is dodging the punches in slow motion.  Also, I think that the costums of Spiderman and the Green Goblin are really cool.  The Green Goblin's mask is awesome.  My only problem with the movie is that it takes a while for it to really get going.  It's not until about half way through the movie that Spiderman begins to battle witht he Green Goblin.  But once it gets going, it's a really good movie.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I think the Fast &amp; the furious is a great movie it is entertaining and it is a good way to learn about racing and to learn about cars,like car parts and stuff like that and maybe even how to work on a car,but i think it is a cool movie i think people should watch it,it is not at all bad it may  have a few cuss word but hey  don't alot of movies,but people get out there and support this movie,like I am,i can't wait for Fast &amp; the furious 2 to come out so i can see it,hopefully it will be just as good as the first one,so get out there and buy the first one,now and don't miss out on the exciting action pack racing movi fast and the furious...
B00005JKZ3|3.0|The first one was better, but I still liked the sequel.  Will Smith's character seemed a little bit cheesy in this film.  First he's upset that know one in the world knows him, then he falls in love with this girl.  It's a little too much of you ask me.  I was expecting to see a comedy-action movie, not a love story.  However, I must be fair.  The movie does have it's moments.  I especially liked the scene in the post office when Tommy Lee Jones's character finds out that he is surrounded by aliens.  The cameo by Biz Markie drew the whole scene together.  I would recomend that you do see this movie.  Don't buy it though, just go rent it.
B00005MP58|5.0|A&amp;E's film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice stays amazingly close to the novel itself. I admit that I had watched the movie quite a few times before I read the book, but I noticed that the movie hardly ever deviated from the book. The movie retained the allure, mood, and message of the book beautifully. If you liked the book, you'll like the movie!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Okay, I'm wondering why Christina chose \\"Dirrty\\" as the first single for \\"Stripped\\" because it does not fit in with the rest of the album, contrary to popular belief.  \\"Beautiful\\" is without a doubt the best song on the entire collage.  The first single was actually supposed to be \\"Beautiful\\" but Christina convinced her management to let it be \\"Dirrty.\\"  That, I will never understand.  Aside from that first single bit, \\"Stripped\\" as a whole is a very compelling work of music.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't bought many albums for the reason that there are only 2 or 3 good songs.  \\"Stripped\\" will not disappoint you at all.
B00005JL96|5.0|When I first saw the commercials on the TV advertising Lilo and Stitch I didn't know what to think. It looked somewhat interesting to say the least. I saw it in the theater, not quite knowing what to expect.<br />I was somewhat surprised. For once, Disney put a truly worthwhile theme in one of their movies. Lilo and her older sister, Nani, are orphans. Nani is trying desperately to keep custody of her little sister but a few problems arise despite her efforts. Coming from a home that isn't quite traditional myself, I was able to relate fairly well to the characters. The characters seemed real (unlike, say, Snow White, or some other passive woman from Disney movies long past). In the words of Stitch: &quot;My family may be little, and it may be broken, but it's still good . . . yeah, it's still good.&quot; I admit that I cried in that movie. Lilo and Stitch is a rare movie in that it is entertaining and it has a message that's worth hearing.
B00006L3S3|4.0|I will preface by saying that Mind Games was one of the few Lennon albums I never did buy or listen to on vinyl or cd, so I can't comment on the comparison between the original (which I plan to get soon, for that reason!) and this remaster. <BR>What comes across most to me (and another reviewer commented on this) is the warmth of the sound. The tracks are crisp and clear, and John's vocals never sounded better, his voice positively radiates on most of the tracks, from the strong and gorgeous opening 'Mind Games', followed by the rocking 'Tight A$' (double entendre John at his best), to the softness of 'Aisumasen' and 'Out the Blue', the falsetto almost over the top 'One Day (At A Time)' and the raunchy, steely rocking of 'Meat City'. Besides 'Mind Games', which is just such a beautifully crafted song, John's 'Bring on the Lucie (Freda People)' has to be one of the great political anthems, it uses its happy, uplifting melody as a counterpoint to the more gritty, earlier 'Power to the People'. Even the weaker songs sound good!<BR>It also seems that John must have had a blast recording this, the vocals convey this sense of happiness and excitement and they are stronger, I think, than on any other of his solo releases.<BR>The only lacking point I think are the 'bonus' tracks. I don't find them very stimulating. I have an old home recording of 'Out the Blue' from the 'Lost Lennon Tapes' show that I recorded off of radio, and this version is so nice. I can't figure out why Yoko (or whoever) thought that those particular three bonus tracks included were worth adding to the cd. <BR>Otherwise a definite must have and surely underrated Lennon effort.
B00006WUWN|1.0|When I went and saw Goldmember in the theater, I thanked the powers that be that I was employed at a theater and got to see the movie for free since it saved me the money I would have lost in buying a ticket. The only reason I gave it one star was because I couldn't go any lower than that, such as no stars or even a negative star. Beside the fact that I don't necessarily like the Austin Powers movies to begin with (hey, you wouldn't like it if your dad's boyfriend forced you to see it, either!) I thought that Goldmember bit the big one. Hard. It's hardly worth the film it's printed on. Save your money and your time and don't buy this movie. But, far be it from me to be ultimately condemning: if you're a diehard fan of Austin Powers, go for it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|woww... i have to say im really impressed with this girl when i went down and bought it i though Gosh what am i getting into, but when i listened in my cd player, i was amazed not only by her voice, i realized shes trully an Artist, a Songwriter and the fact she was 100% involved in this proyect makes me satisfied. Shes not like Britney or any of those pop sensations, and oh, one important point , dont judge the album by its cover, that photo shoot is a hundred percent related to the title and the concept of the album. Stripped is the album in with she just let it go, she is trully herself in it, with all her good and bad things, and im sure she can say this album trully belongs to her, not like her previous effort. <BR> I enjoyed every song to the maximum and i have no favorite ones, everything about this concept album its just beautiful and well done. You have everything, from danceable tracks like Dirrty and Cant Hold us Down, if you like romance you should try Infatuation, Walk Away or Loving me 4 me, and if you are a rock fan looking for some hard stuff from this girl, listen to Fighter and the anthem Make Over. This is not just pop, this is something else, better done, that makes the difference from other artists. This is a masterpiece even if you are not a POP fan, give it a try and buy it. you really will not regreat.
1400031362|3.0|The third book in the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency series is a little bit of a letdown. Having loved the previous two entries (which one should certainly read before this), I was rather disappointed that there of the five plotlines, only two were actually &quot;cases&quot; and two were left unresolved. Plotline one involves the agency's move to share space with Speedy Motors and Miss Makutsi's new role as Asst. Manager there. Plotline two involves a feral young boy found in the bush, which never really goes anywhere. Plotline three involves the apparent poisoning of the brother of an important &quot;Government Man.&quot;<br />This case is much like those in the two previous books as &quot;traditionally built&quot; Precious Ramotswe must insinuate herself into a country household and unmask the poisoner. As always, she uses her intelligence, keen sense of human nature and a desire to help people to arrive at an outcome that's best for all. Plotline four embroils Miss Makutsi in an investigation of the character of four beauty contest finalists. She proves herself the equal of Mma Ramotswe as a detective, and in that sense, she steals some of the thunder in this book. The final plotline revolves around a mystery held by Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni which is hinted at but never unveiled, presumably leaving it for the next book, which is rather frustrating and annoying.<br />Like the earlier books, this one critiques forces of progress and modernization as well as patriarchalism (although in a lighter way than the other books did), and aims to portray a positive picture of modern Africa, one all too rarely seen in the West. As always, the story is delivered in a delightfully fluid and simple well-paced prose.<br />The series continues with The Kalahari Typing School For Men.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a charming, quirky film with a dark side that keeps it from being too sweet.  Overall, it is uplifting -- not only because of a story line that makes you believe good deeds can lead to good things -- but because it is a simple story that proves good films can still be popular and successful without a lot of hype.

0002197286|5.0|Excellent book with comprehensive coverage and high quality plates.  Book production quality is also high. My edition is small enough in hardback to be a true \\"Field Guide\\" although I understand that a new larger edition has been recently published, if plate quality is maintained this edition will be an excellent reference. If you have questions about this text go to amazon.co.uk and read some of the reviews there.  This book recieved the British Trust for Ornithology seal of approval so anything an amateur like me might add is probably superfluous. Excellent reference, nice plates and informative and accurate text
B00005JKCH|5.0|This thrilling film was one of the most magnificent features Marvel has brought to screen. It is about a teenage boy, living in the city, and soon he will realize how it is to be known as a world famous super hero from the sky. With action and romance, I'd defnetly give this movie 5 stars and hope whoever hasn't seen it, see it now! Enjoy.
B000000JO3|5.0|This is a good cd. it is everything minor threat released. The lyrics are great.the sound quality isnt that great but it was recorded in the 80's. it has some great songs like seeing red,i dont wanna hear it,straight edge,filler,salad days,good guys dont wear white and many more. This cd is worth it it says on teh back dont pay more tahn 12 dollars for this. i think its worth 12 dollars for 26 songs.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Their music is great! It's fresh and refreshing. Sure, Nas ne Dagionat sounds a million times better in Russian (Theyr'e not gonna get us) I wish it came with more Russian songs. It comes with 2 and 2 that are only partially Russian. But one I think sounds absolutely great in both English and Russian is 'All the things she said' Listen to this song! It rules. The music video is great too. Please ignore the kisses and look at the song's meaning. It shows how society doesn't let us be free. I love it and I'm not lesbian. Anyway, this is a great CD although it could use a few more Russian tracks. It has few songs but they are all really good. By the way, 'Malchik gay' is Russian for 'gay boy'. It's a really cute song about a girl who is inlove with a guy who is gay and she knows she doesn't have a chance. If you like music that is upbeat yet depressing at the same time (I know I do!) then get this cd. ^_~

B00005B3Z6|5.0|This original UK version stands head and shoulders above the US version.  The cast is amazing and the performances deeper, sleazier, funnier, warmer.  Sometimes less IS more.  This is truly case with Queer as Folk.
B00005BL2A|2.0|Exciter just seems to loll about at a languid pace and is near sleep inducing at best. There are some good songs but overall the effect is that it isn't all that great. Buy this only if you really want to or have to
B00003CX8V|5.0|This is one of those films that seems just as perfect every time you see it.  While time has changed - corporate polictics and the sadness of how we &quot;dispose&quot; of people has not.  The script is sharp, perceptive, funny, charming, and heartbreaking.  Lemmon is absolultely amazing here and McClaine will melt your heart.  This is a beautiful film that should not be overlooked or passed by by potential viewers because of its age.
0440180295|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about my enjoying this book when it was recommened to me by two very good friends, one of whom glorifies Kilgore Trout.  Anyway, I have to say that I am an individual that doesn't particularly enjoy anything war-related and when I found out that the book centered around the firebombing of Dresden, I was even more hesitant to pick it up.  When I finally did, however, I was astonished at what I found.  Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is one of the most refreshing books I have ever come across.  The mere fragmented structure of the book, along with the wonderfully simple language used by Mr. Vonnegut, created an unparalleled atmosphere that fit perfectly with the story of Billy Pilgrim and his voyage as a prisoner of war in World War II.  Many of the ideas presented within the novel were completely amazing to me.  Vonnegut forces us to consider concepts that we have never put our minds to.  There are many images and events within the book that will likely send one to tears, but underneath it all is a message of hope and a cry for peace.  I recommend this book to all our fellow \\"Earthlings.\\"
B00006M183|5.0|I've been listening to the album since it came out. Unlike most of Binuaral and parts of Yield, Riot Act doesn't fall prey to banal songs. There's a sort of subdued energy that the band seems interested in, and of course, the lyrics are introspective as ever. Riot Act sounds like a melancholy B-side to Vitalogy. This is the album that Pearl Jam were shooting for after No Code. To think that songs like Down and the Christmas single, Last Solider, could've been in the album, would have elevated the album to the heights of Vitalogy. While not exactly there, Riot Act is very derserving. Rating: Four stars and a half.

0060925000|4.0|Some blessing it must be<BR>Eludes other novelists<BR>That he simply isn't<BR>He is first a poet<br />Well, an attempted dedication in the author's preferred style which tries to capture the reasons for the admiration for the book. An interesting story set in the post independence India. It is a revelation of a country being reborn. Makes an interesting reading for the Generation X.<BR>Surprising to note that the various mental states which existed then, still carry on. Marital decision still continue to stem from the two distinct schools of thought- arranged versus love. The Indian marriageables, still fight the two, willingly, unwillingly. The Mehras and their families still continue to haunt and resemble and the extended Indian family, is very much a truism. The communal flames which burned then still rage on. It is strange that as a society, we have managed to change and yet remain where we were. <BR>In terms of content there isn't much to fill the tome. I mean that the story per se could have been contained under 200 pages. But then what do we do with the immaculate style. It makes such an interesting reading that I just loved the book. And this is one book which makes you think what sets a great book apart from a good book.<BR>Among other things the plethora of characters is enthralling. There is a bit of everyone in the book whom you can identify with contemporary Indian society. I have personally come across Lata, Amit, Kuku, Mrs. Mehra, Meenakshi, Haresh... every now and then. But then, like I said earlier it is a great book.<br />No more flattery... don't be lazy... just read it.
B00005JKZT|2.0|I thought Peter Jackson did a phenominal job bringing Fellowship to the screen, but failed with this one.<BR>Gollum was great, and exceeded my expectations. What was up with Faramir?  If it was not for the fact that Jackson made him a completely unsympathetic Boramir clone, I would have given this 4 stars.
B00005QDW1|4.0|yeah, it's different from anything else No Doubt has done.And it's really just a light-hearted album, unlike some of their more deeper, and introspective music.You find No Doubt experimenting with some reggae, and surprisingly it works.This album IS NOT pop, like many angst-ridden reviwers have said.There's really no way to define the genre of this cd, you just have to listen to it to see what I'm talkin' about.Gwen sounds better than ever, and the band get funkier than ever with their production and instrumentation.The reason I took off 1 star is because there is some filler(detective,start the fire, and platinum blonde life), but as you can see, that's not much at all, and the rest of the songs really stand out in their ow special way.My fave songs from &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, are in no particular order-<br />1.In My Head<BR>2.Don't Let Me Down<BR>3.Running<BR>4.Hey Baby<br />But all the rest, besides from the three songs mentioned previosuly,is great.Fun and honest.This is good stuff here, and deserves to be in any true music fan's collection.
B0000069CT|5.0|I'm happy buying the CD's from Accardo, only see Accardo in the CD-Case and you know, something good is inside there. Now talking about this particular CD, is amazing the Max Bruch work. Accardo playing incredible the third concert, a beautiful concert, like the other reviewers I agree, that this concert must be included in the violinist repertoire. Why always the #1 Concert of Bruch, Why always the Wieniawski #2, if those composers has other big master works. Now the technich of the violinist like the the materials of his strings, help so much to perform this works. A Bravo for Mr. Accardo in the release of this work. Accardo is a big master of the violin, and always you could associate with Paganini works, but is incredible listen him in other master works, like Bruch, Wieniawski, etc. I hope that he include in his futures CD's unknown concerts for the public in general like Fiorillo, Rode, Viotti, etc.

My fave is still Tales From The Twilight World but this is amazing as well. Go buy it.
B000001FFJ|1.0|I really like Tom Waits, but this is just awful. If I didn't know better, I'd have thought this was a comedy album, although not a very good one. Save your money. Even if you had every other Waits album you wanted, this is a definite pass.
B00006EXCC|5.0|Finally, ABKCO rectifies two problems with their previous US release of Aftermath:  First, they present the album in its ORIGINAL UK format, replacing Paint It, Black (excellent in its own right) with four outstanding Jagger/Richards originals (Mother's Little Helper, Out of Time, Take It Or Leave It, and What To Do).  Secondly, the remastering finally gives the album its due sonically.  The original US CD and Cassette release sounds awful in comparison to the original vinyl pressing.  The SACD remastering is so accurate, it actually sounds BETTER than the old vinyl release.  Now this album can actually be heard in its original stereo format, with all the best qualities of analog and digital combined.  Be sure to buy this one instead of the US Reissue!  Just a side note:  I wish Capitol would reissue the Beatles' entire catalouge remastered, with the first four albums in stereo...
0316666343|3.0|The much-heralded framing device of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" -- a narration by a 14-year-old murder victim -- would serve this ambitious novel better if the character of Susie wasn't oddly modeled on the wise, kind and omniscient angels so familiar from film and television. No teenaged girl was ever so knowing or brave, so stridently NOT a victim of violent crime. She is a combination of ghost, angel, avenger and poltergeist, and fills none of these roles credibly.  Susie's preternatural insights and interventions from her highly personal heaven on high are, however, compelling reading.  It is impossible to believe in this heroine, but it is also difficult to put the book down.  Unfortunately, what creative power Ms. Sebold has is expended two-thirds of the way into the novel and it ends on a note so false and bathetic that it fairly screams \\"Lifetime Movie of the Week.\\"
B00005K3NR|5.0|This movie, based on the very first book from my favorite horror<BR>author, Stephen King, is so well-acted, well-scripted, and<BR>entirely believable despite the telekenesis aspect, that I'm<BR>hard-pressed to find a more modern movie which can top it.

B000006U44|5.0|Released while still in her teens, this debut by Kate Bush is deceptively simple.  One would not expect tons of musical sophistication in the structures of her songs. And, if the truth be told, the emotional palette of the album is fairly limited as well--that is to say, compared to her later work, there is a romantic dreaminess suffusing Bush's vocals throughout that is of unparalleled beauty, and even naivete.<br />Behind the simplicity of the verse-chorus song structures is a ferocious imagination.  The vocal line of the opening song, &quot;Moving&quot; is more than enough to sound like some kind of complete reinvention of all singing. It is one of the most beautiful (and moving) things that Bush has ever recorded. And, as throughout all of her career, the musicians she has playing for her are genuine masters of tact, taste and musicianship.  The bass player, in particular, deserves to be in the Hall of Fame for his playing.<br />There is no doubt that this is a first album by a first-rate artist.  One song, one of the disc's stand-outs, &quot;The Man with a Child in his Eyes&quot; was apparently recorded when she was sixteen.  Again, compared to her later work, there is a very dominant style of piano-bass-drum music over which Bush's sensuous vocals sail.  The attempt at a more rock orchestration on &quot;James and the Cold Gun&quot;, while musically lush in performance, seems a bit forced and is one of the weaker spots on the album. Basically, if the opening song grabs you by the soul and makes you sit up, then the whole thing is a banquet of similar delights.<br />Lastly, the album also features the (now) signature Kate Bush song, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. One of those rare kinds of song that deserves every bit of admiration that Bush's devoted fans lavish on it.  Newcomers should be warned not to overread the meaning in the lyrics, here or anywhere else.  Bush's lyrics seem to be very private, on the one hand, or are imaginative projections of the person in her song.  In other words, and as Bush has asserted in interviews, the artist should not be mistaken for her subject.<br />Over the course of her career, one can actually hear the young woman who is singing on this album growing up--songs about broken hearts, rather than romantic idylls about Prince Charmings.  The freshness, even the innocence, captured on this disk is truly remarkable.  The singing, often in the very high range, is almost painfully moving--a truly amazing musical experience if you can be open to it without irony.in her song.

6305364648|5.0|Meet Arnold Swarzennegar - amazing James Bond type spy who's absolutely clueless as a husband and father. He starts out as impeccable as 007, who he is obviously spoofing, but then loses it and goes crazy when he suspects his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) is cheating on him. <br />his best buddy, Tom Arnold from \\"Roseanne\\" fame, is the perfect comic foil. It's really Tom that makes this act/adv stand out from the crowd. The dialogue is fast, funny, and Tom takes it to the limit. Also up for a laugh is Bill Paxton, another Cameron regular (Aliens), who plays a seedy used-car salesman posing as a spy in order to seduce women. He really goes all the way, completely unafraid of playing a true idiot!<br />It's just so great to watch an act/adv with great action that isn't limited to the usual, off-hand quips from stoneyfaced he-men. This movie is one of my favorites because it's a great popcorn movie that delivers on many levels. It's not just an excuse to blow things up and no one takes themselves too seriously. Everyone obviously had a great time making this film and it shows. I hope they make the sequel soon.

B000055Y0X|4.0|There is one apparent similarity between all of Stanley Kubricks films, and that is everyone of them is very different then the rest. Dr. Strangelove is no exception as his only comedy, and it works on nearly every level.<br />Dr. Strangelove is considered by many as one of his best works. While I dont necessarily place it as high on that list, it is still an excellent dark comedic look at nuclear threat. The story jumps back and forth between a number of characters as an insane general gives his planes orders to drop nukes on the Soviet Union in an unprovoked attack while the rest of the nation scrambles to put a stop to it. <br />Probably the most apparent success in this film is the excellent acting by Peter Sellers in three different roles (the president, a British officer, and the eccentric Dr. Strangelove), as well as wonderful performances by George C. Scott, Slim Pickens and the rest of the cast. Sellers nails each of his characters, adding much of their comedic wit. Many of his funniest lines were improved, such as a hilarious phone call to the drunken Russian president. Kubrick managed to bring out top-notch acting all around here. Also, the fantastic sets are amazing, especially the gigantic War Room set comprised of a gigantic round table and three huge panels depicting the world looming over it. Kubrick shows his photographic roots as well in the stunning cinematography of many of his scenes. Characters and objects are juxtaposed in visually pleasing and symbolic ways, and often reveal visual gags.<br />Much of the humor, as is often the case with black comedy, is easily missed if your not paying attention. In fact, this film definitely favors repeat viewings. Each time I watch it, I notice a few more jokes hidden throughout the film. But the suspense also builds along with the humor as the worlds situation becomes more and more desperate.<br />The only flaws in Dr. Strangelove seem to be its slow beginning which doesnt offer much humor, anda few minor production value problems such as jump cuts and poor audio transitions, most of which can be contributed to filmmaking conditions of the time.<br />This is definitly worth checking out if you like black comedies, or love the visual and symbolic style of Kubrick.
6302862949|5.0|Sure, it is a bit dated but the dancing is fantastic and the plot isn't too bad either. Hines and Baryshnikov are great together and Helen Mirren has a very convincing Russian accent. I just wish it was available on DVD!
B000002BHE|5.0|This was the first Celine album that I ever brought, and IMO the best one she's ever done. A lot of other people think so, it's sold over 30 million copies worldwide and spun three hits. <br />1. It's All Coming Back To Me Now (5/5). The song that got me hooked. I saw the video on VH1 six years ago and it was absolutely breathtaking. Celine showcases her voice in this song like no other and the lyrics are great. <br />2. Because You Loved Me (5/5). The second-best on the album, this is a gorgeous mid-tempo song with uplifting lyrics and a great performance by Celine. <br />3. Falling Into You (4.5/5). A sensual, rhythmic song, the album's title track is great. The African drums in the background are haunting. <br />4. Make You Happy (5/5). The album's first real upbeat tune, this one is a winner, with it's reggae-like instrumentation and upbeat lyrics. Of course, Celine takes the song to another level with her vocals. <br />5. Seduces Me (5/5). Aaaaah, if you want a [nice], romantic song, this is the one for you. The lone strumming of the guitar in the background and Celine's low-key, sensual performance make this another winner. <br />6. All By Myself (4/5). If you wanna hear Celine take her voice WAY up there, listen to this remake of Eric Carmen's 1975 classic. It's wonderful. However, the live version is better, and if that were on here, it would be 5 stars. <br />7. Declaration of Love (4.5/5). A feel-good song if there ever was one, especially after the angst of \\"All By Myself\\". The positive lyrics and Celine's voice fit together like a glove. <br />8. Dreaming of You (5/5). Here begins the \\"big ballad three\\" section of the album. This song is gorgeous. The lyrics are powerfully written and the music produced lushly, and Celine sings it wonderfully. <br />9. I Love You (5/5). OMG, I LOVE THIS SONG!! Passionate lyrics, gorgeous, powerful music and Celine's impassioned delivery make this the #3 song on the album. <br />10. If That's What It Takes (5/5). An English version of Celine's big French-language hit \\"Por Que Tu M'aimes Encore\\", this song is a bit quieter than the other two, but it isn't any less lovely. The simple lyrics are great and Celine performs beautifully. <br />11. I Don't Know (4.5/5). This one is the translation of \\"Je Sais Pas\\", and a bit more direct translation than the preceding song. I really like this song. <br />12. River Deep, Mountain High (4/5). Does Celine do this one better than Tina Turner? Of course not. But she does a darn good job on this one anyway. This one ROCKS!!<br />13. Call The Man - (5/5). A truly beautiful song. The lyrics are emotional and heartfelt, while Celine turns in a vocal performance with shades of both vulnerability and strength in one instance. The choir adds a wall of sound that just adds to it all. <br />14. Fly (5/5). A real tear-jerker, this is the song dedicated to her niece, who died of cystic fibrosis. It is so emotional that I get a lump in my throat whenever I listen to it. This song is translated from \\"Vole\\". <br />TRACKS ON CANADIAN RELEASE THAT I HAVE<br />Natural Woman (4/5). While Celine does not do this better than Aretha Franklin (who could do it better, anyway?), she does a really good job with it. <br />Your Light (5/5). This is an upbeat gem that should have been on all releases. Celine sings very well on this one and the lyrics are great.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Having wondered how some of the tricks of the trade were handled and some shots were filmed with all the special effects, I really enjoyed the commentaries available on the audio tracks, as well as the spidey pop-ups done in VH1 pop-up video fashion. For those of you who watch t.v. as much as movies on dvd/video- you'll know what I'm talking about. The pop-ups really told me some quite interesting facts about the movie and not just all the technical mumbo-jumbo, but the little things about the movie that you never would have thought to consider asking about. I watched the dvd 3 times in a row and each time it was like watching a different movie. The added features with the cd-rom portion on it are quite cool as well, being able to record your own commentary. I liked the movie a lot but I liked the dvd a lot more. All in all, for the average price you will pay, buying Spiderman is worth the buck. You can't go wrong.
B00005A46T|1.0|Unlike their debut album (filled with original music), Iowa sounds like every other death metal album I've ever heard.  The songs blend together and become indistinguishable from each other, save by looking at the track number.  It's really a shame that Slipknot chose to follow up one of the most influential metal albums of the past 10 years with one of the least.  It seems that they have forgotten that good metal is about more then being really loud and really heavy.  What's next?  Adding umlauts to their name?
B00000IQC8|5.0|While Kevin Smith's basic premise behind his critically accalimed debut film is very formulaic, in it being a buddy flick, it is the way he does it that makes it a classic. As qouted in his newest dvd \\"An Evening With Kevin Smith\\" he says, \\"In my world, everyone has really long conversations about interesting [stuff] or just pick apart pop cultur to death and everyone talks in monologue,\\". That quote perfectly describes Clerks more than any othe Kevin Smith movie as whether they are talking about their sex life, Star Wars, or annoying costomers, they do it in not only an intellectual way but do it indirectly. Another high point of the movie is the social issues he tries to tackle, as even though he is a smoker, he makes a point about people's isues with smoking going as far as having a four year old succesfully buying ciggarettes at a point. Also, compared to other Kevin Smith movies there is less fart jokes. Overall, while the movie is great the extras are what makes this dvd. Even though Kevin Smith plays a quiet character in his movies, he is the complete opposite as he always talks and talks very informatively about everything. While the actual movie looks bad the deleted scenes are worse but are still entertaining. Especially the alternate ending as it is completely unlike Kevin Smith. Overall, get the dvd
B00006V9A0|5.0|You Know You're Right is a great album summing up Nirvana's short history and a powerful history lesson at that.  Except for YKYR, all the songs are in cronological order, allowing the listener to experience Nirvana's musical growth and Kurt's emotional turmoil.  Sadly, &quot;Polly&quot; is missing from this compolation.  Personally, I have burned my own copy of &quot;Nirvana&quot; where YKYR is the last song--it feels much more fitting closing on Kurt's self-written epitaph. The pain and dispair in his voice is evident, strongly suggesting that he knew this would be his last song.
0312955006|3.0|This is the 5th Connelly book I've read.  I started with Angel Flight,  w....well, it's not bad.  I then read Blood Work, and was truly amazed by the book.  That's one of a true non-stop page turner I've encountered.  So I bought all of Connelly's book.  I then read the Harry Bosch series, started with Black Echo, then Black Ice.  Now I just finished Concrete Blonde.<br />Harry Bosch is not a distinctive and outstanding hero in terms of his character - as compared with Lincoln Rhyme (Bone Collector) and Alex Cross (Along Came a Spider) or Stephanie Plum. I would to say he is just like a character that like Kay Scarpetta, once you read more him, you will go on to find out what's happening to him.<br />But don't get me wrong, Connelly is a good author that he slowly builds Harry's background and the interest to find out more about him is greater than other characters.  In Black Echo, we know about his background in Vietnam, tunnel rats, etc..  In Black Ice, Sylvia is first appeared, and the Dollmaker's case is mentioned again.  In Concrete Blonde, the Dollmaker case is finally described in fine details (great!!), and the murder of Harry's mother is mentioned.  So obviously I will continue with Last Coyote to find out that murder.  Mr. Connelly has done a great job to create such a character with great skill.  <br />Actually, I didn't plan to read Concrete Blonde just after I've finished with Black Ice.  But I've read the excerpt at the back, and I was immediately attracted by the plot and determined to read this 3rd Harry entry.  <br />It didn't disappointed me.  First, about the Dollmaker case.  Second, the courtroom drama.  Many (non-legal thriller) authors has added some drama scene in their books - James Paterson in Pop Goes to Weasel, Sidney Sheldon in The Other Side of Midnight, but NONE of them write as good as Connelly (though I think Scott Turrow and Richard North Patterson are a little bit better - but they are laywers!!).  Third, I love Sylvia very much, itis very interesting to see what's happening to her relationship with Harry.  <br />In summary - I love this book, but I find Connelly can have better ones (e.g. Blood Work), so I rank this at 3-star, meaning better than average and recommended for you to read.
B00005QZWI|4.0|....provides great music to read the books to. This score was surreal and simply dreamlike. I found myself feeling the emotions of Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn and the others simply by listening to the tracks.<br />  There are beautiful sounds from the likes of Enya and powerful, war-like tracks that will make you feel like you're in the mines of Moria, coming face to face with an ancient demon.<br />I found myself listening to this score as I read the last two books and my oh my, did it make things even better! Enjoy!

B00006JJ1O|5.0|I can't remember the last time i bought a CD and listened to it nonstop from the time i bought it to the time i went to sleep the same night. This has got to be one of the best CDs i have ever purchased. I just can't believe how good every single song on this album is. I have never quite heard a sound like this before, excellent electro-pop beats and very deep and profound lyrics. I recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Oh yes, this is my kind of movie!! It is a film that requires your complete attention to the actors on the screen; you've got to pay close attention to them because there is not any overt display of feelings/emotions until the very end of the movie. No chewing of the scenery--just superb acting! The eyes of Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds (as Anne and Captain Wentworth) express a world of emotions--they simply speak volumes. There is not a great deal of \\"physical action\\" in this film. On the surface, everthing is sooooooo proper, refined and controlled; however, there's \\"loads\\" going on emotionally inside the characters and that is expressed completely through the actors' eyes and facial expressions. Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds performances just blew me away! If you are not watching Root's eyes (as Anne) when she first sees Captain Wentworth, you will miss completely what he has meant to her, what he still means to her and what the movie is about--it's all portrayed in her eyes. Ciarian Hinds, as Captian Wentworth, at first keeps \\"his cool\\" doing the macho thing and not giving the audience a hint of what Anne has meant and stills means to him. But watch that facade start to crumble--again portrayed in his eyes. Some reviewers on this board find Hinds' portrayal of the captain as too distant and cold. I don't. Remember, he was the one rejected by Anne and, to me, he's putting on that \\"I'll show her\\" routine. But as I previously stated that soon changes and you really find out how much he still loves her.<BR>I just love acting of this caliber. For me, you can forget the actors that chew up scenery. Give me the ones that can stun you with their depth of emotion and feeling through subtle means of expression--Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds are such actors. In fact, everyone, in Persuasion, gives superb performances!<BR>If you are into wonderful acting, buy this film!
B00005JKCH|1.0|What can I say about Spiderman, besides that I was very disappointed. Some of the CGI was so bad, that as times I thought I was watching a cartoon. The storyline was very weak and didn't seem to go anywhere.  And the casting could have been much better. I can't understand why it made 200 million dollars.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Let me say one thing before I begin to ramble on about how much I like this album. They are not the saviors of rock and roll. I mean, come on, is any one band really going to save rock and roll? No. And even if there was, is everyone going to like it? Of course not. Don't buy into hype, especially when it comes from MTV and Rolling Stone and all that corporate ..., you're just going to be disappointed. <br />I will admit, it wasn't my favorite album when I first bought it, but I kept listening to it and it grew on me. Julian's raw voice and the catchy songs are very entertaining if you take it for what it is. Though they aren't going to revolutionize music as we know it, its a just a fun cd that is a nice change from Puddle of Mud, Eminem, and all of that ... that they overplay on the radio. Plus, for some reason, it brings out the naughtiness in me and makes me want to be bad girl. If you're sick of mainstream, and expecting just good, fun rock and roll with a retro twist, buy this album. You won't be sorry that you did. <br />(I saw them live and they were even better than on their cd!)
B000001FMX|5.0|the new york dolls were punk rock before there was a punk rock. they sort of sound rolling stones-ish but, i know noone will agree, they're better. this is a great record.
B00007E8NP|2.0|I was very much looking forward to this Ryan Adams multichannel SACD release - supposedly one of the first ones from Lost Highway Records, expecting this to be a true surround feast with all the layers of instruments in the original stereo mix.<br />Imagine my surprise when I popped it into my SACD player and the center channel stayed mute for the duration of the whole album, I simply could not believe my eyes (i.e. ears)!<br />Folks beware, this is a 4.0 quad mix as opposed to the more common 5.1. SACD mix (which usually provides a much richer sound stage especially in the front) and that's not even credited anywhere in the liner notes or CD inserts, yikes!<br />Essentially there is not much of a difference between the stereo mix and this quad mix, the front image is very similar, the only difference being that some overdubbed multitracks (e.g. piano, strings) have now gone to the rear channels, and that's about it!<br />The voice could have been expanded much more (especially into the center) but this way it stays muddied in the front speakers - just like in the stereo mix.  Very sad indeed, such a missed opportunity, it's hard to believe!<br />Why people would still produce quad mixes (a relict of the 70's) when they could have a much richer surround mix is simply beyond me.  Unfortunately there is now little to recommend this SACD release over the original stereo album...
B000000W5N|5.0|I've been going back and forth for weeks trying to decide which is better \\"Sticky Fingers\\" or \\"Let It Bleed\\".... Over and over again, I find myself putting Sticky Fingers back in the CD player and turning it up. And with each listening, I catch just a hint of another subtle musical nuance just beckoning further exploration and indulgence.<br />And that is what sells me.... just a little more on \\"Sticky Fingers\\" then on \\"Let It Bleed\\"<br />This is the Stone's Very Best!
B000065U1N|2.0|This movie was an unfortunately violent and bloody look at war and probably a realistic look at war (I have never been to war). This movie will really make you think about the dangers that the armed forces face in a foreign land, and how brutal war is... <br />I have read that this movie depicts the Blacks in a negative way... <br />WELL... NEWSFLASH: Somalis are not BLACK (they are Somalis and have been Somalis for thousands of years before there was even of CONCEPT of BLACK and WHITE). <br />The American view of RACE has not quite reached Somalia yet!!...  <br />I am a \\"Black\\" American who has studied African history, languages, etc and though White Americans do see us all as the SAME, We are not. <br />The continent of Africa contains THOUSANDS of nationalities/ethnic groups who are as different from each other as can be... if I went over there with a US uniform, they would shoot [me] TOO! Hello!! <br />What this movie DID do however was reinforce racist stereotypes ABOUT Black people for those who lump all people of African descent in ONE group. <br />If you were a racist BEFORE this movie you will be MORE of one afterwards! That I know for sure...<br />Anyway, this movie was sad and the sheer violence inflicted on the soldiers and civilians was hideous. <br />What was supposed to be a humanitarian mission was REALLY a hide and seek with Farrah Aidid that ended very badly with US Soldiers taking extensive casualties for the most part because CLINTON would not commit the heavy armored equipment that was needed to root him out.<br />As is the case with URBAN warfare, there is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. No American can ever forget the images of this conflict and no American should.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I reread the book a few days before seeing the movie so I would know what was in the book and what they had changed. I was surprised to see that they did a wonderful job of moving the book to a movie but of course, I have some picky things. For one, the Ents did not pass my approval. They only seem to be big at the end when they destroy Sauromon's plans, I always imagined that they were tall giants, and compared to Merry and Pippin they really weren't.. Other than the Ents, I was ok with the movie. Not everything is the same, but they did a really good job of it. My favorite part is the Gollum/Smeagol conversation, which made several of us Gollum fans crack up in the theater. I assume that the final movie will show Shelob's lair. But overall, a great movie.
B00004W55E|5.0|She is one of the greatest LIVING american jazz vocalists/songwriters/singers. If you love music and want to hear a GREAT voice, this is a must have. In the words of Q-Tip,\\"...it's precise, bass-heavy, and just right...\\" Trust me on this!<br />Sister, Individuality, I Gotta Go, Gaia...this album was SOOOO slept on. If you like good music, then get this album... and also, see if you can see her live, there is no one like Rachelle... Great singer!
B000065U1N|5.0|I loved this movie, but it's not one I want to watch too much. It's so sad, seeing all those innocent people die...I know it's just a movie, but the truth is, lots of people DO die in real life during wars...I like how it's different, not like your usual cheesy, predictable love story. And btw, I quite liked the bits of humour put in...
6304366078|4.0|John Frankenheimer broke new ground when he filmed \\"Grand Prix\\", putting cameras on single-seater  cars and thus creating some of the most amazing footage ever shot of cars from that era. The movie is on the light side as far as the story development goes, and while James Garner is very convincing as an American grand prix ace, one has a harder time buying this sort of act from Yves Montand who plays the aging Ferrari driver. Eva Marie Saint is cast as a magazine journalist following the grand prix circus around Europe, trying to get a story - a storyline that was recently successfully resurrected in \\"Driven\\". Her lovestory with Montand is not exactly hot, but the highly dramatic race action in Monte Carlo, Spa, and Monza (they still used the famous banking of the autodromo in those days!)more than makes up for that. The film features cameo appearances of some of the era's greatest drivers like Graham Hill. Letter-boxed on a larger screen is the only decent way to completely enjoy the breath-taking cinematography of this classic.
0375823360|1.0|While occasional passages were well-crafted and moving, on the whole the work is chaotic, violent, and confusingly told. Events just happen one after another without reason, and the characters seem to be completely dispensible, dying at every turn.  This gives the book a choppy, discontinuous tone, since the high toll requires frequent introduction of new characters as the old ones are killed off.<br />The rapid scene changes are remarkably predictable.  The plot will settle down briefly just as the fight is over, the escape is successful, and so forth, at which point it becomes obvious that the characters are going to move to some new venue.  And each transition requires some unusual mode of transportation, since after every dramatic rescue poor Lyra is taken off by some new and exotic conveyance. (She's in a houseboat! She's in a sled! She's in a balloon!)<br />The book actually seems more like a made-for-television movie than a novel (and will probably become one before too long).  But as literature it is a failure, with a crude, rambling plot and no emotional depth.  True fantasy persuades the reader that the world being portrayed is real, that the characters matter. This work strains the reader's willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point and even the author tosses his characters into the trash one after the other.<br />I made it through the first book, only to find that it was not even really a book but just a very long first chapter. Given that by the time I finished \\"Northern Lights\\" I was already tired of pointless killing and random cruelty, I simply gave it and the rest of the boxed set of volumes away.
B00005LC4B|5.0|Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director! He took the original masterpiece of revenge and suspense and updated it. In this more intense and graphically violent 90s version, cigar smoking, Southern ex-con, Max Cady, sets out to slowly destroy his former attorney, Sam Bowden. Fourteen years ago, Sam was Cady's lawyer, defending him on the crime of rape. Sam saw what Max had done to this girl, and so, when a report came in that the girl was promiscuous, Sam buried it. The report would have lightened Max's sentence, but instead he was sent to prison for an elongated stretch. Now Max is back for vengeance. His body is a human weapon, with huge muscles and extensive tattooing. The tattoos illustrate his interest in the Bible, especially the gigantic Crucifix on his back. Max Cady sees that the Bowden family is dysfunctional, so, before completly destroying Sam, he wants to have some fun with the family. In a particularly inspirational scene, he seduces Sam's daughter, Danielle. The showdown on Cape Fear River is much more scary and thrilling than the one in the original. Robert De Niro does a superb job as Max Cady, Juliette Lewis does wonderfully as Danielle, and Joe Don Baker is great as Kersek. Robert Mitchum is a good cameo, and so is Gregory Peck. Nick Nolte is pretty good too. He's pretty believable. Jessica Lange seemed to overdo it just a little, but she still did pretty good. This is a totally different thing than the original, and both are equal in greatness. I recommend this movie for thriller/horror fans, but I also strongly precaution younger children not to watch this. And, for those with a really weak stomach, don't watch this right after or before you have eaten. Great movie! The extra features on the DVD are great. The Photograph Montage features clips of Robert De Niro's Max Cady, the Cast of Cape Fear, and photos of Martin Scorsese directing Cape Fear. The Making of Cape Fear is insightful for those who wish to be in the movie business, and it features interviews with De Niro, Lewis, Lange, Scorsese, Peck, and Nolte. An especially interesting element of the making tells how Robert De Niro got pumped up for the part. The theatrical trailer is probably the best movie trailer I've scene. It starts out with picturesque beauty and lovely music, then quickly transforms into the thrills. The DVD is wonderful, and the movie is inspirational.
B0000039PW|5.0|Biggie Smalls drops his debut like an atomic bomb. I mean who can forget the first time \\"Juicy\\" was played on the radio. This was an MC that people felt on all levels. The album was almost flawless but it was the impact that made Ready to Die a classic. Biggie helped usher in an attitude that the east coast hadn't shown in years. Tracks such as \\"One More chance\\", \\"The What\\", \\"Machine Gun Funk\\", and \\"Things done changed\\" were hard to skip each time the album is played in a cd deck. The production is solid and the lyrics are incredible. Come take a ride down memory lane with the late great Biggie smalls...
0316666343|1.0|Don't waste your time!  Never before have I had to stop in mid-sentance and cry out to heaven - \\"OH MY GOD - HOW CHEESEY CAN SHE POSSIBLY GET?\\"  Only to realize that I had underestimated her in the next chapter.  I mean, the whole town turning out (spontaneously) to mourn her - like a freaking Coke commercial? (I actually started to hum, \\"I'd like to buy the world a coke...\\") And the worst offense is the fall to earth for a booty call?!?!  The girl is still 14 in heaven (BECAUSE SHE WAS RAPED AND MURDERED, MIND YOU) and she decides her final burst of glory is to get laid?!?!  The character development was desparately thin - which, in one case, leaves you wondering why the mother comes back after 8 years (during which she did nothing, apparantly) and decides to STAY!?!?  WHY???  And why introduce characters in heaven - scenes in heaven - if Sebold wasn't going to do ANYTHING with them?  I'm stunned to see this book get so much good press.  Do yourself a favor and watch tv instead!
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas was a teenager when he wrote Illmatic. This album is by far the most lyrical release in the history of rap music. i though that it couldn't get any better than Paid in Full or By Any Means Necessary but Nasir Jones proved me wrong...Illmatic does have one flaw....he teased me with 9 songs....my my..we can be some selfish fans sometimes..lol
B000002C1W|4.0|-This cd... is only good because of track 2 &quot;learning to fly.&quot;  I'd buy it just for that track. Seriously. Its good. Otherwise, its ok, but not too great. Enjoy track 2, the rest of the cd is not great, which isn't typical floyd at'll.
B000002WPI|5.0|Hip Hop has never been so gutter and underground. Wu-Tangs debut album sounds like the Rza produced the project in his basement. That's how it suppose to be you know. Along with Nas, Biggie and Blackmoon, Wu-tang gave the east coast much needed respect. Each track is amazing from the production to the lyrics...go do the knowledge god...
0679736646|5.0|I finished reading Ubik and I couldn't even start any other books for a week because I had to sit and think about everything that had just happened.  I've read several other books by Mr. Dick and, while they are all excellent, this is the best.  So far. It has everything that I have come to expect from him.  You never quite know where reality is.  Then you figure it out only to find that you are wrong.  Then another twist comes.  It has excellent pacing, a good bit of humour, and - of course - loads of wild ideas about life, death, the future, consumerism, dreams, drugs, psychic abilities, and the human condition.<br />The first few pages set up the stage for the story in a way that an average author would have required 100 pages of descriptions and explanations.  And it all made sense.  This is a good book if you have never been introduced to PKD's work, since it is very accessible and well written.  It is required reading for any PKD fans who have not yet gotten around to it.<br />Just remember- it is safe when taken as directed.
B000002HFU|4.0|ODB is the battery behind the Wu-Tang Clan. This MC always seems to have fun on the mic just as rap pioneers intended it to be. This album is hot! The production is cool and the lyrics are classic ODB rhymes.
0375414053|3.0|Kate chose the right path in the end- and I had fun laughing along the way. <br />I believe in choice.  I chose to go to university, I chose to pay for it by co-oping and creative means and graduate debt free.  I chose to be an engineer, I chose to build a strong career that pays extremely well.  I also chose to invest my earnings in assets that allow my husband and I to spend time with our children.  I don't buy that families don't have a \\"choice\\" for the woman (or man) to stay home (barring death, illness and tragic circumstances).  You can choose not to have children, you can choose to live within your means, you can choose to develop careers that are flexible and allow for home work.<br />MY POINT- in the beginning I thought that Kate was a borderline child abuser.  She rarely saw her kids, was more hung up on appearances than actual child rearing.  She refused to turn her cell phone off on Boxing Day.  She left her children in the care of a nanny that she didn't totally trust.  She neglected her husband.  Though I don't believe that a woman should become a matronly stay-at-home martyr- I don't see the point in having kids if you don't want to spend time with them. <br />In the end, what would I regret- not seeing my kids when they were small or being slightly set back 5-10 years careerwise?  The answer is obvious, and I plan to live a long life and enjoy my career once my kids have been raised properly by hands-on parents.
B0000024JA|3.0|Tical was as highly anticipated as Snoops Doggystyle. unfortunately this wasn't a classic album by no means. Rza used his throw away beats for the production to say the least. Lyrically Meth held it down and tracks like \\"Bring the Pain\\", \\"What the Bloodclot\\" and the grammy winning \\"All I Need\\" show that this mc can make a hit...The problem with Tical is that there are several tracks that just sounds rushed.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My first thought was that all high schools should show this mini-series in its history classes, but then I realized that all Americans should watch it.<br />Over the years, there have been films about the individual conflicts of WWII--D-Day, Bastogne, the Battle of the Bulge, etc.--but you see in this presentation that a lot of the same guys fought in them all!  If you lived through one, you just got sent to the next battle.  Amazing.<br />By producing BAND OF BROTHERS, the filmmakers have honored the men who quite literally saved the world in that last century and kept their memory alive for future generations.

0066214122|4.0|I give this one 4 of 5 because I think MC is getting a bit too formulaic. That is not to say I did not enjoy this book. I found it to be a little like Jurrasic Park mixed with a spatter of Airframe. Many of Crichton's recent novels seem to be written with a movie deal in mind, and this is one of those. The pace seemed overly hasty at times and distracted from the action. I long for the Andromeda Strain/Sphere days sometimes.<br />All in all a good read with interesting characters. The last third of the book was quite difficult to follow and made me go back to make sure who was doing what since not very many of the supporting players are fleshed out and much as I would have liked. I did appreciate it being told in the first person by one narrator. If you like Crichton you will like this book. If you don't like him this is a good thriller that will keep you interested.<br />The subject matter is interesting and makes me fearful for what may come in our society. Kudos to Crichton for taking on an emerging scientific topic and running with it.
0812550757|3.0|Card notes in a lengthy forward that this was the real story he wanted to tell, but wrote Ender's Game to set all the details first.  I really enjoyed Ender's Game for what it was, albeit somewhat sad.  This book is not like that.  Some of the characters have remained, but the context is all different.  Ender has lived another several thousand years at this point by traveling through space which slows down his actual aging.  The concern is about researchers in a small Catholic colony-planet and their research on the native creatures.  There are few meaningful events spurring on the reader which makes it drag along like a dying buffalo at times.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I always sensed that Beck had a true masterpiece inside of him, and though &quot;Odelay!&quot; came close, this simple, straightforward, heartbreakingly beautiful LP is the real deal. On song cycle dedicated to heartbreak and lost love, Beck stands emotionally naked for all the world to see and triumphs over it all. Every track here is a favorite. Simply Beautiful. A Classic.
0316666343|4.0|I was skeptical when I picked up this novel, but I was quickly hooked on it. The author's decision to tell this book from the point of view of a girl who had already been murdered is what made this book work. I wouldn't put it on my top ten list, but definitely a good weekend read.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Coming from a man who has seen the recent revival of \\"Chicago\\" twice. I can without a shred of hesitation say that the new film version is not only one of the best movies of the year, but it's also one of the best movie musicals of all time!!! Rob Marshall skillfully handles the material with gusto and flare, and Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters) adapts the play in an almost effortless fashion. Together they were able to retain the satirical value of the Kander/Ebb/Fosse musical, and as a matter of fact utilize it to their advantage. <BR>After seeing the play, I was wondering in my head how could they adapt many of these numbers to the screen. (ie the 'Cell Block Tango,' 'Razzle Dazzle' and 'Funny Honey') Mainly because the numbers in many ways are like monologues in song, that and the fact that this is not a musical that was ever made to be \\"by-the-book\\" because lord knows these are characters aren't exactly \\"by-the-book.\\" So in the midst of this revelation you couldn't make this into a standard \\"break into song in the middle of the dialogue\\" movie musical. It needed to be something that fits with the context of the story. But hallelujah! They figured it out! how they did it? I don't feel inclined to tell you, it would spoil the surprise. As for the numbers themselves? All of them are brilliantly staged, and though they'll be compared to Fosse's style you won't stone the filmmaker's to death if it doesn't match. Because Marshall is able to breathe a different kind of life into the dance in the same fashion that he did for Sam Mendes' revival of \\"Cabaret\\" (Ironically another Kander & Ebb musical that Fosse choreographed and directed). Each number is also filmed and edited with striking precision and never misses a beat.<br />But now for the most pivotal component...The actors! The casting for this movie has been kicked around continuously (Names such as Madonna, Goldie Hawn, Charlize Theron, Hugh Jackman...The list goes on)until finally settling with Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Renee Zellweger playing the two merry murderesses Velma and Roxie. Many people looked surprised to hear they these two were to be starring in a musical, but frankly I wasn't. I knew Zellweger could sing since \\"Empire Records\\" and I was also aware that Zeta-Jones was a chorus girl in London before she took up acting. So I knew they could handle it. As Roxie, Zellweger has that look of apparent innocence which is perfectly in character considering she uses it to her advantage to cover up her true intentions. Catherine Zeta-Jones? all I can say about her is that she is sin on legs! I definitely wouldn't want her to catch me with her sister doing \\"Number 17: The Spread Eagle,\\" And as a plus when she has the screen she holds it especially with her opening number \\"All That Jazz\\" which she sings with a power that rivals that of Chita Rivera, and Bebe Neuwirth. For me the shaky casting choice was of The Male lead Billy Flynn. I had no idea if Richard Gere was capable of handling the part. Sure he could definitely play a lecherous lawyer (See \\"Primal Fear\\") but could he sing? ultimately the answer proves to be a big YES! He fills the screen with, dare-I-say Razzle Dazzle and his singing matches that of the 1920's vaudeville style. plus he can TAP!!!It's ironic, last year we were surprised when Nicole Kidman belted out a tune. Now Richard Gere is shooting to stand next to Fred Astaire. It makes you wonder who will surprise us next year? Now when I saw the play the part of Matron 'Mama' Morton was played by an Aretha Franklin-esque woman which to me was perfect cause that's the only way I could ever have pictured the character to be portrayed. So when I heard that they cast Queen Latifah to play \\"The Mistress of Murderers Row,\\" I didn't have to worry about it one bit. And surely enough my prediction has proven to be correct. Same also goes for John C. Reilly and his meekly sympathetic portrayal of cuckolded husband Amos Hart. His rendition of 'Mr. Cellophane' is definitely a milestone in this film and invokes pleasant memories of Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers. Oh, and on a sidenote Lucy Liu was delicious in her cameo as Go-To-Hell Kitty.<br />All in all Chicago is a close to perfect stage-to-screen adaptation. That never lets up, keeps you invigorated with showstopping numbers and performances that are bursting with sin. sure it's not the stage show, but it's still the closest thing to it.
B00003CX7L|4.0|I liked a lot about this video (didn't see it in the theatre), just about the worst thing in it was the approx. 9 minutes of movie previews and commercials for other videos. Once you get past that the viewer gets to see a little short PIXAR made about two desk lamps and their antics, just about anybody ought to like that. The story itself I won't really get into except to say that the plot while somewhat kiddish is entertaining with something for everyone altough I think some gags are aimed more at adults than children. <BR>The thing I liked most about it is the way everything was rendered so well. Final Fantasy was completely computer generated but the characters had a certain artificial action in their movements, in Toy Story 2 everything moves very well indeed. Woody &amp; friends move more like people than puppets, the lighting is realistic, details are amazing ( I certainly remember seeing Jessie's reflection in a window). If PIXAR can do so well now (see also Monsters, Inc.)what will they be able to achieve in another 5 years.

B00005JKZT|5.0|The two towers is yet again another 'good' film of the LOTR trilogy, I say 'good' as to really grasp any of the films intricacies you *need* to have seen 'The fellowship of the ring' prior to watching it. Saying that, however, I do not wish to demene the film as a whole, it is a 'good', 'acceptable', *watchable* film, with many twists, a couple turns and a good ol' fight scene. Though, it would be preferable to watch all three at once (imagine it... 3hrs per film, x3 films, you have a whole week-end of fantasy right there), for now just the two, or even just the one will do.<br />But in all honesty, if you havent seen the film yet, dont buy the DVD. You cant simply purchase DVD's / Videos merely on the merit of the reviewers or trailers. If you can, while you can, go to your local cinema and experience LOTR : TTT (yes, three T's!) in full on surround-sound widescreen action. Once you have, you can get yourself the DVD which will (in most likelyness) also give you the oportunity to get the 'cinema feel', but at home (if you have a widescreen tv, and a surround sound system, all the better).<br />Then again, if you've already seen the film then... BUY IT. dont ask why, you know why
B000006045|5.0|I hadn't really heard of Massive Attack untilly very recently.  I discovered however that Massive Attack is the band who did Angel, one of my favorite songs.  So I bought the cd and I fell in love with it.  Mezzanine is a down tempo, dark, heavy, mysterious, cd that is the perfect music when you just want to relax, or when your in a really bad mood.  I highly recommend Mezzanine(if anyone ever reads this review), so go out and buy it you'll be extremly happy you did.

B000001FI7|5.0|I accidently stumbled upon this cd when I was just snooping around on amazon (sorry for the promo).  Anyway, I was checking out massive attack and in one of the reviews Portishead was mentioned.  Well I went out the next day and bought it, and I must say this cd is friggin awsome.  I am normally into electronica, but this stuff is amazing, it's low key chill music that calms and sooths you into complete relaxation.  There are a lot of songs on here that I really enjoy like, Sour Times (a classic), Glory Box, and it could be sweet.  I want to reitterate that this cd is amazing, I highly recommend it, even though the chances of anyone ever reading this review are slim to none.  Anyway go get this cd, you'll be glad you did.
0743504364|5.0|I first saw this book in the film version which came out a year ago.  It both broke my heart and angered me that so many of our men had to die because our President didn't send them the equipment to successfully complete their mission.  He was too busy fooling around in his personal life to care I guess... but that was another story sort of.  Anyway, I didn't think I would ever have time to sit down and read the book, so I purchased the abridged book on tape.  Its far more detailed and even easier to follow than the film!  Joe Morton does a fantastic job of reading this sad tale.  All the essential elements of this modern history are included.  You don't want to turn off the CD!!  If you don't have time for the book, or if war stories aren't your thing but you're still interested in knowing what happened out there, pick up the CD.  Is worth it!
B00004XONN|5.0|When I first purchased this album, the only Radiohead that I had heard was pretty much The Bends and their stuff on the radio.  Upon first listen, on Christmas morning, I thought that I had just bought the most nonsensical CD of all time.  Everything in its Right Place, with its little blips and moans, received a quick tap on the next track button.  Going through the first 10 seconds of every track, I thought that Kid A was one of those records where the only good song is the one that gets played on the radio.  Idiotheque was uncomfortably electronica.  Kid A started off too boring.  I threw the CD to the side and enjoyed my other Christmas presents.  A few days later, bored, waiting for the end of the holidays, I picked it up again.  I listened to the whole album, straight through in one sitting.  As each great track unfolded, my opinion changed completely.  Each song is sonically perfect, with some help from Nigel Godrich, and the band never wastes a moment in making the album even better.  Sure, Treefingers is just filler, but it sets the mood for the rest of the record.  How to Disappear Completely has an awesome strings arrangement, thanks to Jonny.  Idiotheque and Morning Bell pack a double punch, and both blow me away upon each listen.  Buy this record.
0743216458|5.0|I was deeply saddened when I learned of Stephen Ambrose's death, mostly because I had come to respect his work so much- and because he was the foremost WWII historian out there... producing books that were both engaging and accurate.  I saw the miniseries \\"Band of Brothers\\" before I read the book and couldn't stop watching it when I did!  The book is just as readable as the film is watchable and it becomes much easier to follow the characters when you read the book.  Great one by Ambrose.  Its got the drama and action of \\"D-Day\\" on a more personal scale.  Ambrose will be missed.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I was disappointed when I found out the movie was loosely based on my favorite Robert Ludlum novel. Once I got over that, I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining the movie was. Rather than rely on gimmicky special affects and things of that nature that plague so many of todays movies,it makes use of solid acting, a good story, and action scenes that feel like you are in the middle of them. I also enjoyed some of the quirkly humorous scenes throughout. A good ole fashion spy story!
B00000258J|5.0|This the kind of down &amp; dirty, hard-core, unadulterated, &quot;slap-ya-momma-upside-the-head&quot; type of blues that I love.  Muddy is definitely in his element, and it seems that only the bionic harp skills of James Cotton would do to back him up.  Johnny Winters and Pinetop Perkins are also featured, but this bad boy is all Muddy Waters. The remake of &quot;Mannish Boy&quot; is out of this world.   <br />Each song feels as if Muddy had been wanting to make an album like this for a long time.  This album not only enabled him to finally cut loose and &quot;do his thang,&quot; but it shows why Muddy Waters is, was and will forever be the King of Delta Blues.  Nothin' fancy, nothing prissy - this albums just plain ROCKS!
B00005V9IK|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theater.  Then I purchased it and watched it over, and over, and over, and over [I didn't have cable].  Anyway, I think that this is a pretty good movie. It is in no way based on fact (I hope!) but it has a good story line, and it made artfully.  Its interesting to watch the beginning with all the different characters all over the country living their lives, and at the end, its neat to see them all come together.  And the speech- the speech about Independence Day is pretty good too.  I particularly liked Jeff Goldblum's character in this movie, and Goldblum himself is such a good actor.  His lines and gestures are always so natural!  I would recommend this to any fan of science fiction as a great addition to their home collection.
0316666343|3.0|When I read the description of this book and the ratings of it for number 1 on the best seller list I thought it would be a great book. It was very disappointing. I kept reading it to find out what everyone was raving about and to see if it improved. When I finished the book my impression was &quot;what did people see it this.&quot; I am a trauma therapist working a great deal with abuse victims and families and this book could have gone in such better directions. My impression is word of mouth about it being #1 is what keeps people buying it not word of mouth after the read.
B00005JLS0|4.0|Two Weeks Notice is a classic romantic comedy that brings both Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant back to the genre they do best.   The characters were enchanting and the chemistry between Bullock and Grant sparked.  Some of the plot elements were a bit contrived, but the film had a good mix of witty dialogue and physical comedy.  All in all, a delightful way to spend a few hours, especially during the often-stressful holiday season.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I first took note of Allison Krauss and Union Station when they released their incomparable cover of the Foundations' pop classic, 'Baby, now that I've found you.' It's either the jazziest blue-grass or the blue-grassiest pop jazz ever conceived, and it stands completely apart from the original. Most covers--and most especially Nashville covers--add absolutely nothing to the original arrangement, which usually amounts to a net subtraction. This is never the case with Union Station. Krauss' voice alone--a lilting high-lonesome wail, at once brash and plaintive, seductive and scared--would lend moment to a railroad timetable. The instrumental virtuosity and the supporting voices--and the eclectic tastes of the musicians--make for an unequaled experience in what we might call American post-roots music: The instruments of bluegrass and the melancholy of the hills combined with the pace and complexity of modernity.<br /><br />If you don't know it, the members of Union Station, with Allison Krauss' fiddle but minus her voice, made up 'The Soggy-Bottom Boys' on the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack, itself a bluegrass tour de force. They cover themselves on this album, Allison Krauss &amp; Union Station: Live, doing the Boys' 'I am a man of constant sorrow,' itself a cover of the very old Clinch Mountain Boys standard. They also do 'Down to the river to pray,' which Allison sang so beautifully on the 'O Brother' soundtrack.<br /><br />There are 25 songs in this collection, and many of them are uniquely-perfect Union Station covers of other artists' work: 'Baby, now that I've found you,' 'Ghost in this house' by Hugh Prestwood, perhaps the best-ever Nashville songwriter, 'Maybe' from Garth Brooks' underappreciated In... The Life of Chris Gaines album. Union Station had covered the Keith Whitley tune, 'When you say nothing at all,' for a Whitley tribute album, producing a version as haunting as the original without borrowing a thing from Whitley's rough honesty. If anything, the 'Live' version is even better.<br /><br />And Union Station is a band that simply &lt;I&gt;is&lt;/I&gt; better live. They are all virtuoso bluegrass players, but playing live they feed off the energy of the audience, taking that virtuosity to a higher level. This is a very complicated, Apollonian music, and at times the tension is almost unbearable.<br /><br />Seize the splendor! This is a two-CD set for fifteen bucks, a smokin' deal and an excellent introduction to a very rich kind of bluegrass.thing, the 'Live' version is even better.<BR><br />And Union Station is a band that simply &lt;I&gt;is&lt;/I&gt; better live.

B00005R2M3|4.0|Despite a few songs that are real clunkers and some highly bizarre lyrics, this album is a good one that you will enjoy listening to for a while.  Besides the three big hits on the album, there are a few other songs worthy of mention.  Te Dejo Madrid and Poem To A Horse (a rather sobering song about an addict) are both fine album tracks, and most of the rest of the album is quite nice as well.  This is a decent album, and all the more impressive that Shakira produced and wrote much of the album herself.  Hopefully her sophomore effort will be even better.
B000063CPL|4.0|Maiden went on a rampage throughout the world, damning all notions that they were down and out by consistently knocking out audiences all over the Earth.  Their last concert on the Brave New World tour was the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janerio in front of a mind-boggling 250,000 fans, but the live release that bears the same name shows that they handled it all with their usual style: play what they want and play it all with turbo-charged feriocity.  They rip and tear through new cuts like 'Wicker Man'&quot;and &quot;Mercenary,&quot; but also wallop the audience with mainstays like &quot;Wraithchild&quot; and especially a searing version of the &quot;Trooper.&quot; They also show their range by also handling mellower songs like the eponymous &quot;Brave New World&quot; and the epic &quot;Fear of the Dark.&quot; Maiden showed that they were back and better than ever.<br />The sound quality is exceptional.  Every note played is crisp and clear and every instument can be heard clearly.  And Bruce sounds excellent as he wails his way through the set and every once in a while rouses the crowd with a 'Scream for me Braziiiil!&quot; wake up call.<br />The only real problems with the cd is once in a while the crowd overwhelms the quieter parts to the songs such as the section of guitar melody before the first  verse of &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; by moaning along to the melody.  The other problem is that the three guitar arrangements sometimes are a little too overwhelming, and drown out the bass and some of the vocals as can be heard on &quot;Number of the Beast.&quot;<br />But, those flaws cannot bring down an otherwise superb live album.  Maiden satisfies their fans hunger for loud, searing metal that only they can bring forth well.  If you are looking for classic rock/metal played to the hilt, Rock in Rio is for you.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Reduced to simplest terms, Wilco, the brainchild of Jeff Tweedy, has embarked on a tour of our You-Knighted States as it wallows in the beginnings of a new decade.  \\"I Am Trying...\\" appears to be about a relationship made fragile by tension and uncertainty, but a line here and there could easily refer to a terrorist.  Not knowing when the song was written, I can only guess at Tweedy's antecedents.  \\"Kamera\\" treats the themes of internal and external vision, how we see and are seen, and the tag line \\"No, it's not OK\\" tells us, as does the spelling of the title, that we don't see as clearly as we imagine.  The sweet string intro to \\"Jesus, etc.\\" belies the dark poignancy of the lyric:  \\"Bitter melodies turning your orbit around.\\"  I especially like the parallel images of stars as setting suns and lovers as burning suns.  \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" is a perfect deception, a song about illusion and loss, masquerading as a calliope theme.  In the final analysis, Wilco has crafted a marvelous assembly of tunes, bright and dark, light and heavy, poured out for us to drench ourselves in.
B000002H97|4.0|After a decade of dominating the metal scene around the world and selling millions of records with a grand total of one music video and one single, Metallica broke away from the metal norm in 1991 with this superb release.

No matter what others say, The Lord of The Ring Movies are the best movie making in a very long time (next to The Matrix).  This even supercede The Star Wars trilogy 100X.  I can't wait for next year - the Return of The King - the final trilogy.  And best of all, I can't wait for the extended version of the DVD.  LORD OF THE RINGS ROCKS!!!
0316666343|4.0|The concept behind this book is a very original one.  It is written with beautiful language that draws the reader in and grants them the ability to feel what Susie feels - love, confusion, sadness and a realm of other emotions.  The Lovely Bones is definitely a work of art.  At the same time, in the second half of the book there are a few twists to the storyline that  I felt were out of place.  Overall, it is worth the time to read it.
B000063V8R|5.0|Season Three of Star Trek: TNG was full of spectacular episodes, from the philisophical &quot;Who Watches The Watchers?&quot; to the humorous &quot;Deja Q&quot;, and the thrilling &quot;Yesterday's Enterprise&quot; and &quot;The Best of Both Worlds, Part 1&quot;. In other words, this season contains something for everyone.<br />The seven disc DVD set contains 26 episodes, with the special features available on the seventh disc. Special features include both character and episode analysis, which is entertaining. Unfortunately, not every episode is reviewed in the special features, making them seem a bit empty. <br />Aside from that minor flaw, fans should find plenty to enjoy about this season. Even if you only want the set for the amazing cliffhanger finale (and I would imagine some do) even casual viewers of The Next Generation will find hours of entertainment in this set.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is perhaps the best book that I have ever read.  It places you in the mind of Scout, a young girl who finds her family in the middle of a scandal that rocks her entire town.  This book offers many lessons to be learn about standing firm in your beliefs, the love of family and friends and the importance of equality.  Scout's father, Atticus represents the father figure that every impressionable child needs - full of love for his children and worthy of their respect. The actions of many of the townspeople demonstrate how fickle people can be.  The book will teach you to open your heart and mind to the world around you.
B000066NW0|3.0|In today's music avril is out of the ordinary because unlike some people that have to have produced pop garbage, rely on their sexy looks or the lack of knowing what race they are avril<BR>knows who she is and has a good strong voice. Her music speaks<BR>to teenagers the way an album should. Sex sells is obviously what keeps half these overrated and rather talentless artists in the music industry today. Avril is attractive but doesn't have to lower herself to a sexy image to sell records cause she<br />is actually talented. I liked this album alot and do suggest that you buy it if you like what you have heard from her so far.
0151008116|5.0|I bought this book to read on a business trip.  Within 20 pages, I put the book down, knowing that I didn't want to read it amidst aircraft noise, jostling passengers, and irritated children.  <br />This is a book to be read in a quiet room alone, where every word can be absorbed and enjoyed.  The author brings the story alive with vivid colors and rich, almost-musical, command of the English language.<br />Martel has the gift of a superb story-teller.  This is one of those books you read slowly because you don't want it to end and, when it's done, can't wait to find someone else to talk it over with.
B000002A46|5.0|I love this cd, i listen to this all year.<BR>Mariah has the voice, my god how can somebody has such a great voice?<br />buy this if you want a happy christmas, and hear a great singer singing great songs.
B00005JKZT|4.0|Technically, this is a masterpiece. Gandalf's opening duel with the Balrog is the most extraordinary thing I've ever seen on film. The climactic battle sequences are astonishing, and WETA's Golum makes ILM's Jar Jar Binks and digital Yoda even more embarrassing (if that's possible) - Golum isn't a sprite, he's a living, breathing character. But despite the technical brilliance, the whole film left me a little disappointed - and, dare I say it, bored. The problem isn't with Jackson's stunning direction nor WETA's special effects. It's the screenplay. The books are so rich that any adaptation will be necessarily schematic, so it's a matter of choosing carefully what to show. \\"Fellowship\\" was easily the best page-to-screen adaptation ever written, but I think the choices made this time were less wise. In their enthusiasm for swash-buckling heroics and pseudo-erotic dream sequences, the writers have lost sight of the Ring. The epic quest is sidelined, and we're left wondering what all the fighting's about. Saving the final sections of the second book for the third film (presumably), doesn't help. I have no objection to this kind of shuffling (using the opening of the second book for the climax of the first film worked brilliantly), but here it fails. The story is deprived of unity and we don't get much sense of what's at stake, what Sauron's or Saruman's plans are, nor any real sense of anticipation about what might happen next. A little recapping and scene-setting at the beginning would have helped, too. More effective use could have been made of voice-over narration from Galadriel, as in \\"Fellowship\\" where she deftly summarized \\"The Hobbit\\" and the Ring's history in the opening minutes. Here, she's brought in at the 90-minute mark, but it's too little too late. The writers try desperately to reassert an epic tone by putting unreasonably eloquent speeches into Sam's mouth at the end, but it just doesn't play. I still give it 4 stars for technical brilliance, but in terms of story it's not a patch on the first.ms of story it's not a patch on the first.
6300214540|4.0|top Gun is a fun movie, i really don't like plains, but the movie is cool and watch tom cruise so young is funny.<BR>tom is so energetic, so beautiful and so young in the movie, that we get why he got such success.<BR>the other actors are really cool too.<BR>the soundtrack is great, i love the winner-oscar song &quot;take my breat away&quot;, it really takes my breath away.<br />see it and enjoy.
0375707972|2.0|Reading this work, I had the feeling that Schlink had come up with several reasonably good ideas for short stories, but then unwisely decided to knit them together into a novel. The trouble is, they don't assemble well. The result is a contrived, stiff and disconnected effort, with the whole adding up to less than the sum of its parts. A failure, though briefly, here and there, an interesting failure.
B000002BQK|5.0|Eberything in this album is good, i love every single song.<BR>Mariah has the most beautiful voice i ever heard and that's it.<BR>nothing more to say, now you have to buy the album to comprove that.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Never would have thought of buying this album from just hearing the song Dirrty on the radio &amp; seeing the video but I listened to it at a local music store and it rocked so I wound up buying it.  Really digging Make Over - what a great song - love the edge - sounds kinda like Sinead at the end - very cool.  Christina should do more like songs like that one.
0767903862|5.0|If you like Bryson and enjoy reading about travel, you should love this book. Once again Bryson brings to us hilarious anecdotes intertwined with some of the best travel literature around. While not as funny as A Walk in the Woods, it is equally just as an enjoyable read. Some of the more memorable moments are the descriptions of Harold Holt and the various venomous and other lethal buggers you might encounter in the vast country that is Australia. If you are a Bryson fan, I would recommend this book in an instant.<br />\\"The loathsome sluggish stone fish, so called because it is indistinguishable from a rock, but with the difference that it has twelve spikes on its back that are sharp enough to pierce the sole of a sneaker, injecting the hapless sufferer with a myotoxin bearing a molecular weight of 150,000.\\"<br />\\"And what does that mean exactly?\\"<br />\\"Pain beyond description followed shortly by muscular paralysis, respiratory depression, cardiac palpitations, and severe disinclination to boogie.

B0000026J1|4.0|I used to own this album but for some reason sold it back in the musically dreary early '90s.  Well, now I have it back again and am very glad that I do.  While not quite as classic as its predecessor, the more well-known &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, this album is still a very solid, melodic Europe offering.<br />&quot;Superstitious&quot; was a great single when it came out, and it is still a pleasant, mid-tempo rocker to lead off this album.  &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; is an awesome power ballad that I do remember there being a video for way back when.  Very underrated song that should have been a bigger single.<br />While &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; album may rock a little more beginning to end, this album still rocks with tracks like &quot;Let The Good Times Rock&quot;, &quot;Ready Or Not&quot;, and &quot;Just The Beginning&quot;.  On the other hand, songs like &quot;Coast To Coast&quot; and the closing track &quot;Tomorrow&quot; are surprisingly mellow while still very good.  &quot;Sign Of The Times&quot; is a good example of a fine melodic power anthem on this album.<br />For sure, this album belongs in melodic rock fans' collections.  Definitely a tuneful, rocking delight to listen to after all these years.
0151001634|5.0|I had heard many great things about this book so I decided to hunt it down and read it. I started reading this book the day I got it and once I started I was hooked. The pages fly by so fast! One second it seemed that I was on page 37 and the next thing I know I'm on page 172. There's only a hundred pages or so left, may as well finish it. <br /> So what was it that made this book so addicting? The story is simple enough: A retarded boy named Charlie Gordon wants to learn to \\"reed\\" and \\"rite\\". But no matter how hard he studies, he doesn't seem to get anywhere, but the scientists are surprised at Charlie's eagerness to learn. <br /> There is a mouse named Algernon and the scientists have done something to the mouse to make him smarter, to solve complicated mazes. Algernon gets smarter . . . alot smarter. Now, what if the same thing could be done for Charlie? <br /> This is only the beginning. There are many many flashback scenes in this book that reveal Charlie's past. Some of the dialogue (especially when Rose and Matt are fighting) is superb because it sounds so natural. I've read some 75,000 pages worth of books and the character development in this book is among the very best I've ever seen. <br /> I could say more, but let the story speak for itself. <br /> Very very rarely do I read a book in one sitting--this is one of those books.

0060926317|5.0|I was shocked when I started reading all the reviews and (mostly negative) press about this book, as I have loved this book for years.  <br />The \\"real people\\" (the small tribe of Aboriginal people) have a powerful understanding of spiritual things, as well as an ability to be practical and flexible.  It must be understood that this \\"tribe\\" consisted of 62 people maximum, and typically, they traveled in much smaller groups (about 10-12 per group). Obviously, they are NOT the majority of aboriginals in Australia, but a very small minority of people, who have decided to stop \\"reproducing\\" mainly because they have indicated that the desert is becoming hotter and there is less food to sustain them. <br />I never sensed that they were \\"depressed\\" about their situation; in fact, their view of death is very positive. When one of the \\"real people\\" dies, it is because they have come a point in their lives (often at age 120 or so) that they are becoming \\"excited\\" about the Spirit World. They have a celebration (a party) and after that, the individual does a certain breathing technique which allows them to shut down their \\"chakras\\" and they die.  <br />Although we westerners may call this a form of suicide, from the \\"real people's\\" perspective, it is simply time to continue in another form, as there is an understanding and an acceptance that we lived before we came to this earth, and we will live after we leave it... we are forever beings. <br />There are many criticisms of the book. I will share them, and I will share my perspective on them:<br />1. Criticism: Men's business and Women's Business: It seems that among Aboriginals, \\"men's business\\" and \\"women's business\\" are kept separate. Yet, in the book, there seemed to be no separation between the men and the women. My perspective: the \\"real people\\"  are \\"flexible and adaptable\\"; they are in very small numbers now, and perhaps they accept that some customs and traditions no longer \\"fit\\" their needs.<br />2. Criticism: AmongAboriginals, no-one enters another person's tribal boundaries without permission, yet in the book it was never mentioned, even though they traveled about 1400 miles. My perspective: I see the \\"real people\\" as both \\"flexible and adaptable\\"; they were not looking to establish territory, conquer, fight, steal food, or anything bad. However, perhaps there is simply an easy explanation... if the \\"real people\\" did not encounter anyone to ask permission to enter, then it simply was not necessary. <br />I mean, seriously, if there was no-one at the \\"border crossing\\" (so to speak), then what's the worry?<br />3. Criticism: Desert Aborigines do not collect dung for fuel. It would take forever to collect enough of the small scats of kangaroos and dingoes to cook anything and would be pointless given the availability of dry wood.  My perspective:  Morgan said they wood was used when it was available... and only when wood was not available, did they use animal dung. <br />4. Criticism: Burnum Burnum \\"denounces\\" Morgan.  Read his brief letter:<BR>\\"I Burnum Burnum, hereby sever all ties with the Author Marlo Morgan and the book entitled 'Mutant Message Down Under'. My reaction to the book was an innocent response to what I considered an account of an inner journey, which uplifted Aboriginal Australians in the eyes of the world. In my innocence, I did not understand the tribal ramifications of my support for the Author.  I am a non-initiated, non-traditional, urbanised, Aboriginal from the East Coast of Australia\\".  Yours Sincerely,  BURNUM BURNUM<br />My perspective:  In this statement, I sense no \\"denouncing\\" of Morgan, but he is severing ties because of the \\"ramifications\\" from the tribes.  That's quite a difference in motivation. <br />5. Criticism: Morgan (allegedly) admits her book was a lie. <BR>My perspective: Here is what I have gathered: <BR>In a interview with SBS Radio from New York, Morgan broke down and said: \\"I would like to say that I'm terribly sorry and my sincere, my sincere apologies to any Australian Aboriginal person if I have offended them in any way. \\"I think of them in only the highest ... please read this book ... with an open mind and see if there is anything, anything at all that is derogatory to your people, because it is not.  I love them. and I wish them equal opportunity and the best.\\"<br />Additional criticism:  (Below copied from [...] )   Meeting with Steven Segal at Warner Brothers Studios...   Mr Segal invited the delegation to meet with him and other associates at his Warner Brothers studio office. Dannion Brinkley, an associate and friend of Marlo Morgan, also attended the meeting and arranged for telephone link-up with Marlo Morgan who was in New York city...<BR>At the completion of this discussion, Marlo Morgan gave her word that an apology in writing, set on the conditions and agreements of the Elders and cited and signed by a lawyer, would be forwarded to the delegation within 48 hours. <br />This apology was to include the fact that her claimed journey was a Hoax... <BR>it was bitterly disappointing when two days later, during a brief discussion with Damien Brinkley at the foundation room, we were told that we were no longer negotiating with Marlo Morgan. <br />My perspective:<BR>The meeting was uneventful. Morgan has apologized only to the effect that her book may have offended people, but, never that the book was a lie.

0811826848|5.0|this was the greatest beatles book i have ever read! i was a new fan of the beatles, but then, by just flipping through, i leatrned so much! it gave me a great insight on the lives of the greatest musicians ever. when i finally sat down and read it for real, the pictures plus the personal accounts (which is way better than somebody else talking about the beatles. as one of them said in the book, i forget which, only they knew what they were going through)told me everything i needed to know about the beatles. i recommend this for all bveatles fans, old or new, as a must-have!!!
B00003CXDU|4.0|This is a movie about a group of actors from a canceled SCFI TV show. These actors make the money by making appearances at the shows fan conventions. These actors are mistaken for the real thing by a group of aliens who are being slaughtered. They ask for their help. They have biult an actual ship based on the television transmissions of this show. <br />This show is a great spoof of Star Trek and its fans who have a hard time grasping reality. The ending is fantastic when they have a shootout with the bad guys. The show is renewed as &quot;Galaxy Quest: The saga continues&quot;. I guess they would have got into trouble if they called it &quot;Galaxy Quest: The Next Generation&quot;.
1573229725|4.0|As always with a Waters novel, you get excellent writing, well drawn characters, and an intrigueing story.<br />The only reason I did not give this novel 5 stars was because of my disappointment that there was not one truly good person amoung any of the main characters in the book.
0783229100|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. It is about two con-men (Robert Redford and Paul Newman) who set out to avenge the death of a friend by a ruthless mobster. They set up a bogus horse race gambling facility and con this mobster in betting on bogus horse races. I have one problem, with all of the people in on this scam, I don't think their take was very high. Unless, they recieved a percentage based on their involvement. <br />This was a great movie that really captured early 20th century America. A big part of this movie was The Music of Scott Joplin. The sting revitlized his music. People think that \\"The Entertainer\\" was Scott Joplin's biggest hit. In reality his biggest hit was \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\". In Scott Joplin's time ragtime was considered \\"The Devil's music\\". The Sting gave Scott Joplin ,and his music, the dignity and respect it richly deserves.
B000069CWE|4.0|After Limp Bizkit's, &quot;New Old Songs&quot; came out(and was horrible), I wasn't tottaly sure how good this album would be.  Sure, I really like Hybrid Theory and their DVD but I didn't think it needed to be reinterpreted.  But then, when i was listening to it, it was just one good song after another.  The people who reinterpreted it and sang did a great job: Jonathan Davis from KORN, Many different rappers, Aaron Lewis from Staind, Stephen Richards from Taproot, and that's just to name a few.  I totally recommend this album to any LINKIN PARK fan.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When Christina came out with \\"Genie In A Bottle,\\" I wrote her off as a bubblegum pop-princess, which I'm sure many have done.  I continued to ignore her even throughout the entire \\"Lady Marmalade\\" phase, although I will say that it takes a lot of moxie for anyone to walk around in a corset and almost nothing else on.<BR>Then \\"Dirrty\\" comes out.  I saw the video and thought, \\"Wait a sec, Britney had a chapps thing going in her video for 'Overprotected', but this is definitely different.\\"  Why?  Britney had more clothes on.  I love Redman so I definitely gave this song a chance and decided to go out and buy the album =Stripped=.  Instead of 5 Stars, I give this album a \\"10\\"STAR.<br />1.  Stripped Intro - I rarely like listening to interludes and such (Janet Jackson is the one who turned me off to interludes), but this one really fits because it really does introduce the whole album.  Christina has something to say in this to everyone out there, those who love her, those who hate her, those who don't really care, etc.<br />2.  Can't Hold Us Down - feat Lil Kim.  I like the \\"girl power\\" message, especially since I agree that there is a double standard pertaining to men and women in societies everywhere, but especially here.  Lil Kim's appearance makes sense, especially since she makes music in a predominantly male genre and is successful at what she does.<br />3.  Walk Away - My FAVORITE!!!  I know she didn't write the song for me personally, but I totally felt everything she said, since I have that type of relationship with someone. You know, where the person is totally bad for you but you can't \\"walk away\\" from him/her.<br />4.  Fighter - I believe this is directed towards her ex-boyfriend and various industry fakes who have let her down and expected her to stay down.  I love the guitar part (by Dave Navarro).<br />5.  Primer Amor Interlude - Christina tells the listener, in spanish, about what the next song is about...<br />6.  Infatuation - spanish flavor, with somespanish sprinkled in.  She talks about her first love, a Puertoriqueno, and how he made her feel in the very beginning.  I can totally relate to this, since I too have a weakness for Latino men.<br />7.  Love's Embrace Interlude - light, airy, Mariah-esque and totally perfect<br />8.  Loving Me 4 Me - a smoldering, sultury love song.  I can't remember when I heard a more perfect song.<br />9.  Impossible - Alicia Keys wrote this song.  Her collaboration with Christina has produced a soulfully wonderful song.  This is one collaboration I never would've dreamed happen.<br />10.  Underappreciated - The eventual decline of passion in a relationship has provided Christina with inspiration.  Only in this, the man is so complacent that it is ridiculous to think that she would've stayed with him when the feelings faded.<br />11.  Beautiful - Linda Perry composition.  I heard that Perry used the rough cut of the vocals because they were the least \\"pop\\" acrobatic vocals Aguilera produced.  Good idea, because this song would've given Christina an opportunity to turn out a Mariah-esque performance and Perry helped her keep it real.<br />12.  Make Over - part garage band, part spanish rock.  This is a good song to rock out to.<br />13.  Cruz - a lazy, hazy song to drive to.  It gives the feeling of watching the scenery go by while in the passenger seat and just daydreaming.<br />14.  Soar - Inspirational in the tradition of Mariah's \\"Hero\\"<br />15.  Get Mine Get Yours - She said that this was a \\"tongue in cheek\\" entry into the album.  It's great to dance/groove to, as long as you don't really listen to the lyrics.<br />16.  Dirrty - all about the party, not necessarily in a club.  a party jam to get the people on to the dance floor.<br />17.  Stripped Pt 2 - the other Stripped interlude.  she answers the question \\"Is she a virgin?\\" (No) and she asserts that, although she's not a virgin, that doesn't make her a slut (say it girl!!!).  It may be hard to see her as having to struggle, but if you take in having to suppress her real self to portray a cookie cutter Britney image, staying mum about the abuse at home when she was little, and the mean-spiritedness of her peers while growing up, then yeah, she has struggled to make her dreams come true.  Unlike Britney, not everyone in Christina's hometown were supportive of her ambitions.<br />18.  The Voice Within - This song seems to be about her childhood, where she's talking to her younger self as though her younger self is a person she can actively talk to.  It's assuring the girl inside that she'll always be here and always be strong.<br />19.  I'm Ok - This song's to her father, illustrating how her childhood wasn't all lightness and fairy dust, but were punctuated by visits from the boogyman who turned out to be her father.  She says that she's ok, but one wonders if she is...she survived but this is something she'll always carry with her but the fact that she survived shows that she's ok.<br />20.  Keep On Singing My Song - This is a cumulation of everything that has happened to her, where she says that she doesn't care what anyone thinks because she's going to continue to do what she thinks is right for her and not what they think she should do.<br />Overall, this was an empowerment album, which Christina delivers the message in so many different ways.  The fact that she was able to deliver an album with a diverse sound (not the pop formula) and with an acutal message (instead of the eternal love theme of pop) shows that she's able to grow artistically.  I totally appauld this album.<br />This album shows that she has talent, which is more than I can say about Kelly Osbourne, who's banking on her family's name for a music career, and who had the nerve to spew venom towards Christina (who has talent and actually worked to get to where she is today).<br />By the way, I heard that Britney Spears has shortened her \\"hiatus\\" and is working on material for her new album.  Perhaps she heard Christina's work and decided to take the same direction...???
B00006JJ1O|5.0|The sound of this group certainly brings a fresh air into electro music genre. With a varied well-blended sounds, T.A.T.U has brought attentions from music lovers all over the world. You would think two girls from Russia would be hard to penetrate the already over-crowded music scene, especially to penetrate American markets.<br />T.A.T.U has proven everybody that their music speaks for themselves; creating a unique atmosphere (a blend of synth, electro, & pop). Don't hesitate to pick this one up........  Definitely deserves more than 5 stars ! Peace....

Good idea, because this song would've given Christina an opportunity to turn out a Mariah-esque performance and Perry helped her keep it real.<br />12.  Make Over - part garage band, part spanish rock.  This is a good song to rock out to.<br />13.  Cruz - a lazy, hazy song to drive to.  It gives the feeling of watching the scenery go by while in the passenger seat and just daydreaming.<br />14.  Soar - Inspirational in the tradition of Mariah's \\"Hero\\"<br />15.  Get Mine Get Yours - She said that this was a \\"tongue in cheek\\" entry into the album.  It's great to dance/groove to, as long as you don't really listen to the lyrics.<br />16.  Dirrty - all about the party, not necessarily in a club.  a party jam to get the people on to the dance floor.<br />17.  Stripped Pt 2 - the other Stripped interlude.  she answers the question \\"Is she a virgin?\\" (No) and she asserts that, although she's not a virgin, that doesn't make her a slut (say it girl!!!).  It may be hard to see her as having to struggle, but if you take in having to suppress her real self to portray a cookie cutter Britney image, staying mum about the abuse at home when she was little, and the mean-spiritedness of her peers while growing up, then yeah, she has struggled to make her dreams come true.  Unlike Britney, not everyone in Christina's hometown were supportive of her ambitions.<br />18.  The Voice Within - This song seems to be about her childhood, where she's talking to her younger self as though her younger self is a person she can actively talk to.  It's assuring the girl inside that she'll always be here and always be strong.<br />19.  I'm Ok - This song's to her father, illustrating how her childhood wasn't all lightness and fairy dust, but were punctuated by visits from the boogyman who turned out to be her father.  She says that she's ok, but one wonders if she is...she survived but this is something she'll always carry with her but the fact that she survived shows that she's ok.<br />20.  Keep On Singing My Song - This is a cumulation of everything that has happened to her, where she says that she doesn't care what anyone thinks because she's going to continue to do what she thinks is right for her and not what they think she should do.<br />Overall, this was an empowerment album, which Christina delivers the message in so many different ways.  The fact that she was able to deliver an album with a diverse sound (not the pop formula) and with an acutal message (instead of the eternal love theme of pop) shows that she's able to grow artistically.  I totally appauld this album.<br />By the way, I heard that Britney Spears has shortened her \\"hiatus\\" and is working on material for her new album.  Perhaps she heard Christina's work and decided to take the same direction...???
B000069HKH|3.0|I liked this album, but it is very different from Bruce's classic stuff.  He seems to have abondoned a formula that was his own for something that is more mainstream and less like his classic style.  These songs seemed forced into the same mass produced form that makes most modern music sound exactly alike, and in most cases, like worthless and meaningless [music].  I know this might sound cheesy, but his old music from albums like greetings from Asbury Park and Darkness on the edge of town were amazingly unique and even had a better sound (not to mention much deeper meaning and emotion) because they had Bruce's style all over them. The songs did not follow a redundant pop pattern and they were recognizably different. Overall, this album is pretty good, it has some good songs and catchy tunes, but i feel it is a bit forced and it certainly deviates from Bruce Springsteen's distinctive and creative writing style.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This sountrack is the reason I got into instrumental music.  It so good, i never get tired of hearing it .  At first  I didn't really liked it, but I started listening over and over again and it became my favorite cd.  I don't know what is it, but the songs in this cd(especially Hedwig's theme) make me want to dream, dream to live in a world like that, full of magic.
B00005QK5X|5.0|If you like punk music or culture at all you MUST LISTEN TO THIS.  they helped to save the Northwest for the punks and indie kids, if you are punk and indie check em' out NOW!  Sage has a very unique guitar style, easily recognized - danceable angst flanged rhythms of doom hammerin' over yr head!!  yah, this box set IS worth it, it's actually worth it, go ahead and buy it all three records are PURE PUNK
B000066AXE|5.0|I didn't want to watch this movie.  The trailers were boring.  The write-up on the DVD package lackluster and dull.  When my roommate bought a copy I did everything I could to avoid watching.  And for several weeks I did just that.  Then came the night that I ran out of excuses.  I had nothing else to do, and no other movies that I hadn't seen, so A Beautiful Mind when into the machine.  And after ten minutes I was hooked.  Russell Crowe really lets his acting abilities shine in this film, and Ron Howard's direction is perfect.  I sat through the entire film mesmerized, and tears came to my eyes as John Nash fought back from a schizophrenia that would have incapacitated most anyone else.  What a triumph!  What a hero!  What a role model to anyone who feels overwhelmed by their physical or mental limitations!  I walked away from the movie knowing that if John Nash could find success despite an illness of that magnitude, I could overcome anything that life throws at me.  There are few movies that stay with you the rest of your life, but this is one that I know I will remember forever.
B00003CXE7|4.0|This is a great movie for adults that are not squeamish.<br />There are many threads that run through this tale. The one I identified with most was the loyal soldier/family man, who above all seeks to discharge his duties as a soldier and husband/father honorably. At the whim of his adversaries, all that is precious to him is taken away - except his desire to continue on honorably. In short, it is a collage of cliches, but it is not hard to watch because it manages to make sense all the way through.<br />The acting of Russell Crowe is perfect for this role, but I could imagine many of Hwood's best doing a good job in such a well-constructed tale.<br />The cinematography is exemplary and really propels a great tale to the next level.<br />All in all, this is a must watch, if you don't mind a prodigious quantity of blood and death.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a compilation of all the number \\"1\\" singles the Beatles had through their time together. There can be no argument over ommisions, as it is not a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album however much some people want it to be. Some purists would prefer the original mono versions for authenticity, that is a matter for personal taste, myself I prefer the modern versions. After listening to this collection if you want to explore equally good non number 1 tracks I would suggest Abbey Road and the White Album.
078322608X|4.0|Brad Pitt got most of the praise from this film for his portrayal of the demented son of a wealthy Bio-tech researcher. However, I think most people overlooked Willis' performance in this role. In my opinion this is one of the first films in which Bruce Willis shows just how good an actor he can be. Sure the Die Hard films had already cemented Willis as a movie star, but he pulls out all the stops here in Terry Gilliam's sci-fi genre bending flick. <br />Willis shows us how good he is at being quiet and contemplative--something that went on to win him accolades in films like 6th SENSE. But Willis also brings this haunting sense of desperation and pain to his character which he hadn't shown in his work prior to 12 MONKEYS.<br />As for the DVD it's got the goods when it comes to extras. Fans of Terry Gilliam will be happiest as the documentary \\"The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys\\" centers on Gilliam's vision for the film and takes you from pre-production meetings about set designs all the way to Gilliam's publicity tour to promote the film's release.<br />Great story (with an ending filled with so many subtle twists that it still causes much debate on Internet BBS), excellent performances, and outstanding camera work by the director and cinematographer. 12 MONKEYS is a must have for any DVD collection.
B000069AT7|1.0|speilberg is quite possibly THE WORST DIRECTOR ALIVE TODAY.  I loathe this with a passion
B00005JLSC|5.0|I definately enjoyed this movie.  I haven't seen it on the stage so I don't have any comparison to that version but I thought this one was wonderful.  The casting was wonderful and, while I had a bit of trouble seeing many of them in roles like that, I got drawn in quickly and ended up loving most of the performances.<br />I'm probably a bit biased because I love musicals and I'm so hopeful for more to do well but I still think everything came out great.  I've actually seen it twice now and I've liked it more each time.  It seems to be doing quite well and hopefully that will keep up.  :¬)<br />... The film, also distributed by Miramax, goes into wider release in January.<br />'We were only limited by seats. We are basically selling out everywhere,' Sands said.\\"
0380977788|4.0|Coraline by Neil Gaiman.  2002 by Harper Collins.  1st Edition, later impression.<BR>Gaiman's 1st `novel for all ages' (from flap of DJ)is also rated for ages 8 and up.  It's illustrated by Dave McKean, who collaborated, with Gaiman, on `The Day I Swapped My Dad for 2 Goldfish'.<BR>This is a spooky story of a small girl's adventure into a mirror world that is strangely, scarily warped.  White-skinned, button-eyed `people' (like Coraline's `other mother' and `other father'), cats and rats that talk, lost children's souls, and a missing mother and father all combine to test Coraline's bravery and wits.  In this twisted `other' world, Coraline must rescue her parents, the souls of the 3 lost children, and herself using only her courage and cunning.<BR>A very entertaining read, which I consumed in an afternoon of quiet time; but spooky enough that I'm not sure I would expose many 8-year olds I know to it!<BR>There was the occasional sentence or dialog that would have benefited from closer, more thorough editing.  But other than that rare distraction, this book reads very well, in a Fairy Tale cadence, is spooky enough to make you skin crawl, and, at times, you may even jump with a little startle. <BR>Enjoy it.  It's a fun read, and is written to be read aloud to your kids, niece or nephew.  Read it to your grandchildren, then send them home to their parents.  That's always fun!  But be prepared to have company in your bedroom or even your bed that night!<BR>RDKedd@ABNormalBooks.com.
0449227421|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  Really.<br />Unfortunately, I couldn't bring myself to care about the one-dimensional characters.  Combined with extremely difficult-to-believe plot twists (Petagon security can't stop someone from leaving the building?  I think not), this book was uninteresting and not engaging.<br />In the end, I kept feeling that I had better stories of \\"government-clones-perfect-soldier\\" elsewhere.  It seemed familiar from beginning to end.
0783225733|5.0|I loved the movie when it came out and the DVD experience did not fail to show. It had great insight to the making of the movie, the real life story, and it also lets you listen to the musical soundtrack (won't need to get the CD if you liked the music by JAmes Horner). Plus it had the usual advantages: widescreen and an excellent surround sound soundtrack to make it feel like it did in the movie theatre. This is one that is the tops of the DVD movies it shows that DVDs were invented for films like this one.
B000069AUI|5.0|This, and the release by THE CHURCH \\"After Everything Now This\\", are the 2 most mind-blowing, musical releases for 2002, in my opinion. I am not going to dissect each song here, but suffice it to say, this release is one of those musical masterpieces that come along once in a blue moon.  The arrangements are hauntingly beautiful at times, and highly charged at other moments.  The songs are intense, emotional, and heartfelt.  Chris Martin has a way to do this, considering his vocal inflections and emotiveness.  He pours his heart out on these tunes, and you may even find yourself 'welling up' with tears, the delivery and emotional intensity are so compelling and real.  Listening to 'AROBTHH' on a killer set of highly revealing/detailed speakers like Electrostats or Magneplanars will even magnify this experience moreso.  If you are human, and like quality music, your hair will stand on end.  It's THAT GOOD!  If you like Coldplay, check out \\"After Everything Now This\\" by the venerable Aussie band, THE CHURCH.  Another impeccable release for 2002!  Cheers!
B00005JKZT|1.0|As a \\"Lord of the rings\\" novel fan, Fellowship became one of my favourite movies ever because of its similarity with the book (I understand the few things changed to bring the novel to theatres). <BR>But this one, aughh, is too different from the novel, and the worst of the cases, in detriment of the history and the characters: <BR>- Frodo NEVER goes to Osgiliath, or faces the Nazgl<BR>- Faramir is wise and gives his best wishes to Frodo's mission, he is not a bad guy, he doesn't take Frodo as prisoner, or treat him bad at all.<BR>- Frodo NEVER attacked Sam with a knife.<BR>- Sam never runs to Morannon (the gate) or gets caught in quicksand or whatever, or somebody spot them.<BR>- omer has been held in prison for disagreements with Grima, he is not an exiled, and who comes to Helm's deep at the end of the battle is Erkenbrand, and also, some kind of Ents are the ones make and ambush to the orcs when they are in full retreat.<BR>- Aragorn (and friends) never fight against the wolves or fall to a river or has been rescued by a horse or returns when every one thinks he is death. He is always at the side of Thoden<BR>- Thoden is not under Saruman's spell, but under Grima's gossip<BR>- The ents already know that the forest has been destroyed and decided BY THEMSELVES to attack Isengard. It is not because some hobbit tells them to do it.<BR>...and so on, I can be writing for hours and hours...What can I expect for the \\"Return of the King\\", Gollum king of Gondor? Frodo taking Sauron's place instead of throwing the ring into Mount Doom? Arwen marrying Gandalf? Or what???
6304806418|2.0|Okay...to my opinion on Evita, The Motion Picture.  I am not comparing this to the Broadway play--I have not seen the play.  I am a musical fanatic, so it's not that I find musical productions boring or trite or weird or anything.  The movie really didn't do it for me.  I don't think Madonna should have been cast as Evita. <br />Yes, I'm aware that there were similarities in Evita's and Madonna's lives, and even physical likenesses.  And yes, Madonna is a singer.  However, Madonna's voice, I feel, is not suited for the rangy, lusty material in this musical.  \\"Like A Virgin\\" is not \\"Buenos Aires.\\"  After seeing this movie I listened to other recordings of Evita, and Madonna's renditions don't even come close to matching the passion and gusto to those of Laurie Beechman or Patti LuPone.  In fact, the ranges of the songs were quite obviously adjusted to compensate for Madonna's lack of vocal ability.<br />One reviewer stated that \\"This isn't the Broadway version, but this movie stands on its own.\\"  No, I don't agree.  A movie should be compared to others in its own genre.  A Broadway musical should not be made into a 3-hour music video. <br />I also had a hard time with the way Evita was shot.  The song \\"Buenos Aires\\" is really lively and full of energy.  Madonna should have been out on a bright, sunny open marketplace, dancing(utilizing one of her strengths), with action happening all around; horses, peddlers, merchants, and aristocrats.  For the most part, it was shot in a dark, dingy nightclub (in a single room).  Why film something in one room?  You're not confined to a stage anymore!  I found myself becoming extremely bored and restless after about an hour into the film.<br />Contrary to some other reviewers, I thought Antonio Banderas did a fine job.  I understand that his character was somewhat different than in the original.  Regardless of that, I felt he breathed fiery Latin passion into his role and gave the movie the spark it much needed.
B000001Y79|4.0|Amazing music by No Doubt. Though they have become increasingly popular, I think it is partly because they have compromised their edgy/different personality to do so. That is why I like their early music, like this CD, so much more.<br />It's a perfect antidote for bubble-gum music, with songs about all different kinds of things. Though you may buy it because you like one or two songs on it, all the songs, I thought, were pretty good. You could tell a lot of thought had been put into them. <br />A classic.
0802136834|5.0|In this excellent, thoroughly researched and well-presented history, Alison Weir brings us up close and personal to six women who shared the life of one of England's greatest kings.  From his first wife, Katherine of Arag&oacute;n, the Spanish princess to whom he was happily married for 24 years until her failure to produce a male heir to the throne led him to throw her on the dump heap, to Katherine Parr, who managed to survive his temperamental outbursts and suspicion and who ultimately buried him, Weir shows us these women not only as queens and consorts, but as women with distinct personalities and characteristics which helped some to survive while dooming others.<br /><br />The first two wives are presented in greatest detail; we see Katherine of Arag&oacute;n, devoutly Catholic, not only suffering private agony as a soon-to-be discarded wife about to be thrown over for a younger and more attractive woman, but genuinely concerned that Henry is jeopardizing his immortal soul by divorce and remarriage; and Anne Boleyn, whose one great accomplishment was producing the greatest monarch in English history, Elizabeth I; headstrong, devious, fatally impulsive, rising out of nowhere to the pinnacle of success and ending her days on the execution block.  In shorter chapters we also see Jane Seymour, the great love of Henry's life, giving him his only son and dying tragically young; his rebound marriage to Anne of Cleves, whom he loathed at first sight, dumping her for Katherine Howard, a teenage airhead who lost her head on the block for adultery right under the king's nose; and Katherine Parr, amiable, level-headed, sensible enough to put up with the aging king's increasing suspicion and cruelty by keeping a low profile, and ultimately, along with Anne of Cleves, surviving him.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, for this reader the most interesting of the six wives was Anne of Cleves, generally dismissed in the history books as a klutz with a passing resemblance to a horse, whose only crime was succeeding Henry's most beloved consort.  Anne may not have been a raving beauty, but it's to Henry's discredit that he was unable to appreciate her as a gracious, good-natured, sensible woman, a good stepmother to his three children.  Well regarded and respected by the extended royal family, she ended her days as the most successful of the six wives, rich, independent, and generally content.  Weir brings 16th century England vibrantly to life, through the lives of these six remarkable women.<br /><br />Judy Lindsucceeding Henry's most beloved consort.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Now THIS is what the DVD format was made for!<br />\\"Fight Club\\" is possibly the most surprising thing that has ever happened to me.  First of all, it has been completely mismarketed.  While the subplot of two men starting an underground movement where anger and aggression is released through physical conflict IS present in the movie, Fight Club is a much more intricate web of human emotion.  It does not glorify violence, as many may have assumed.   This is a very ugly movie, and yet, it is strangely beautiful.  Director David Fincher is known for making cheerless yet compelling movies, and this is his finest.<br />To reveal too much about the plot is to spoil the fun, which is possibly why all of the trailers for this movie seem to be so misleading.  But in essence it is the story of Jack (to which he is indirectly referred, as his true name is never revealed) and Tyler, two unlikely strangers, who meet one day and realize they are tired of life.  That night, as both are leaving a bar, they drunkenly begin to fight each other because its something neither of them has ever done, and when it is over, they are intrigued by what they have done.  This fighting continues as Tyler and Jack find it is a way for both of them to release their anger and tension without guilt.  The weekly fighting sessions begin to attract more people, and this escalates to the point where the fighting actually begins to become an organized activity.  Of course, the fighting itself is chaotic, but all the members of the club are bound under rules that must be followed.  This continues for a while, but soon, Tyler becomes bored by it all, and uses his faithful followers to orchestrate more complex scenarios.  This eventually leads to an out of control Anarchist movement that extends far beyond the power of Jack, who has become powerless now that Tyler has assumed full control.  Throw in a suicidal girlfriend, Meat Loaf, a twist ending, a barrage of innovative visual directing techniques, and thePixies, and you have yourself one killer movie, without a doubt the best film of 2001.<br />And that's not even the HALF of it (pun intended for those who have seen this film).<br />I would be lying if I said that Fight Club is likely to be enjoyed by all who see it.  And not to be sexist ladies, but I think Fight Club may be targeted more towards the guys (this is not to say the feminine populace will not like the movie, only that their is a higher level of testosterone present than there is estrogen).<br />However, even if you see the movie and dislike it, the two-disk special edition version of \\"Fight Club\\" is possibly the best overall release to come from Fox EVER.  The widescreen anamorphic transfer is flawless, the 5.1 surround is exceptional, and the features are...extensive.  Begin with FOUR full length audio commentaries (I only listened to the last one so far, but it was highly entertaining), a seemingly endless supply of featurettes, a few deleted scenes, a barrage of great storyboards, and end with some cast and crew bios and trailers for good measure. On a more comedic note, there's also some hilarious publicity material, and an outtakes reel.  That's a pretty deluxe package, and I can't see any reason to not own this DVD.  Don't bother renting it, it you've read this far, your going to want to own it!<br />This isn't just a movie, it's an experience. Highly recommended.
B00005JL2O|1.0|The first two movies were great, but Goldmember is not funny. I think I might have laughed 2 maybe 3 times. The rest of the time it was like watching idiots try and figure out why they were even doing a movie, and none of them realized that it was supposed to be a comedy.<br />1.) Mike Myers needs to go back to his original ideas, be the Austin Powers that he created.<br />2.) Have the bad teeth.<br />3.) Dr. Evil does not need to act modern or hip.<br />4.) The sidekick role with mini-me and Austin Powers, not!<br />5.) Lastly, the female has to have chemistry with Austin Powers.<br />Don't waste your money. Watch the first two over again and have a really good laugh.
0553328255|5.0|This collection of stories about the famed detective Sherlock Holmes and his faithful \\"sidekick\\" Watson is truly a timeless classic. It is filled with intrigue, mystery, romance, vengeance and ,ultimately, murder. Its beautifully constructed plot and the whole motive of the murder, the clues and the amazing deductive powers of Sherlock Holmes will hardly fail to entertain you and keep you craving for more. Not only will you find crime and punishment on these pages, but also the unique world (the 19th century England) and personalities (cold-blooded Holmes and always left behind Watson) which Doyle has created. <BR>There is one downside to this marvellous classic. When you are done reading the book and there are no more adventures to consume you will feel nostalgic. One could only wish to relax in the comfort of an armchair in front of a fireplace while a rainstorm rages outside and Sherlock Holmes is patiently absorbing the details of another case, on No. 221B Baker Street
B00006LPK5|5.0|A great movie, Dragon Slayer meats the 2002.  Well writen and casted even better.  A devine intervention of Godzilla, Puff, Elliot and a very bad attitude in the mix.  I recomend you to atleast watch it once, I think and am sure that you will atleast enjoy it the first time around.
B00000F566|5.0|This is sexy, fun, and the ultimate guilty pleasure! It is among my many cheesy favorites, including Grease, Grease 2, and Footloose. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey have a chemistry you don't see often in movies. Baby (Grey) is a teenage daddy's girl that falls for tough guy dance instructor Johnny (Swayze). This movie has great themes and also one of the best soundtracks. For anyone looking for something to do on a Friday night or a new favorite movie, I reccomend it.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Thhis film was the first film I have ever seen Natalie Portman, hense it was her first film.  I fell in love with her.  She a tallented acctress and does not always get the credit she  deserve.  Well acted by Jean Reno, he has always been one of the best foren acters I do go in search of more films that involve him.  Miss Portman is getting quite the Filmaugraphy goin on, but still in the b movie's in the sense of her role.  But this film was a great opener to get her on the strtch to stardom, and Jean Reno was a great compliment to be involved as well.
B00007BK2N|5.0|What a terrific film this is! The U.K.'s most eclectic filmmaker turns his gaze this time back to the late Seventies and early Eighties for '24 Hour Party People', a unique docu-drama look at the music scene in Manchester at the time.  Tony Wilson and his Factory Records ruled the scene with such groups as Joy Division/New Order, Happy Mondays and others.  This is a nostalgic, funny and fascinating look back at this period.  Every element of the film is first rate especially Steve Coogan as the amazingly ambitious TonyWilson the real stand out.  Needless to say the soundtrack is excellent.  Even if you're not a real fan of this music, you will like this film.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This cd is fantastic, it really has earned its place in my cd player. Christina, yet again, has shown her full tallent. Her voice is amazing, and the lyrics are very real and deep. Once you listen to it, you wont be able to stop. Its fabulous!!! <br />1.Cant hold us down feat.lil kim- an awsome song with a great message.   9/10<br />2.Walk Away - a great song. it has a r&b/soul feel, which makes it easy to listen to, but takes some getting used to.  6/10<br />3.Fighter-  really cool. a really powerfull song.    7/10<br />4.Infatuation- i love this song. the two part harmony in the chorus sounds awsome. i love it.    10/10<br />5.Loving me for me- a cool song, but i find it a tad boring.  5/10<br />6.Impossible- this is such a good song and it really shows the flexibility of christinas voice. very cool.    9/10<br />7.Underappreciated - a good song, but lacks excitement.   6/10<br />8.Beautiful- well, the title says it all. this really is a gorgeous song, the lyrics are really deep and emotional.   10/10<br />9.Make over- a weird song, but a cool beat.      6/10<br />10.Cruz- a real driving song. As it is about leaving the past behind and starting over, its a very inspirational song about change.   8/10<br />11.Soar- a good song, but it is very repetative and too long.  5/10<br />12.Get mine, get yours-  i love this song, especially the chorus, very catchy.  9/10<BR>13.Dirrty- a very upbeat song, and great to dance to.  8/10<br />14.A voice within- a nice ballad, again showing christinas fantastic vocal ability.    8/10<br />15.Im ok- the first time i listened to this, i cried. it is such a touching song.you can hear her crying which proves it is a song from the heart. it is so beautiful.    10/10<br />16.Singing my song- a great song but gets a little bit boring towards the end. very inspirational.   8/10<br />Overall, this is the best cd i have ever listened to and i would recommend it to anyone. Christina is a perfect example of a contemporary artist who actuallyhas talent. She is fantastic live and really an inspirational artist. She, again, has proven she is more than capable of producing a world-class album.
0316666343|3.0|I read the book, it was a little painful to finish, because it wasn't going anywhere for me.  I expected a different ending and it was ordinary.  The book was well written, it came from an unusual point of view and it was an interesting story line, but I didn't find the &quot;special&quot; something that it had to make it a bestseller on all the lists.  Susie Salmon was a real 14 year old girl that was experiencing life through the eyes of the world she left behind.  It is not a mystery if that is what you are looking for, but it is a good rainy day book for the weekend.  Enjoy.
B000058DFO|4.0|Syreeta Wright is one of those singers that was at Motown in the late 60's early 70's, that Berry Gordy should have focused on more to become a superstar, than one of his other proteges (do I need to mention the name of the person in question?)  Anyway, she had a beautiful voice, and would have become a major superstar had she had the right person guiding her singing career, other than Berry Gordy, or her first husband, Stevie Wonder, whom she married in 1970 when Stevie turned 21 years of age (she and Stevie made a great couple together writing songs like their song &quot;signed, sealed, delivered, i'm yours&quot; which you can hear Syreeta singing in the background - apparently, she tried to boss the &quot;Bull&quot;, and Stevie wasn't going for that).  Anyway, you will enjoy this c.d. collection of Syretta's songs immensly!
0688078958|5.0|Bill Bryson's book was a cozy, easy, enjoyable read. It felt like the author was just chatting away in my living room, sharing a slew of amusing anecdotes about the crazy, mixed up language we call English. The chapter about the use (and misuse)  of English around the world was hysterical. I shared that section with a fellow math teacher and she roared.<br />Not only amusing, the facts presented were actually quite absorbing. Particulary interesting were the parts about the early history and development of the English langauge, beginning with the Anglos(and the Saxons)and the concept of a (possible) universal mother tongue out there somewhere in history. Hearing just a tidbit about the Celts and the Basques only whet my appetite for more. I enjoyed the sections on slang and dialects as well. After reading the section on the history of the Oxford English Dictionary,  I read The Professor and the Madman,by Simon Winchester,  which outlines that same story a bit more fully (but with a very unusual twist).<br />For someone who has just a slightly better than average understanding of the topic, the book was a delight. I found it to be an enlightening and entertaining read.
B000002U9W|4.0|I've always been surprised that this doesn't receive more props when the discourse turns to the pre-&quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; Pink Floyd. Maybe that's because its successor album, &quot;Meddle,&quot; gets so much praise (at least, in my presence); maybe that's because there's a shard less of the then-signature &quot;space rock&quot; sonic experimentation here than on any of the pre-&quot;Moon&quot; Floyd sets. But the title track remains an elegantly smart sprawl between electronica, Ligetian vocal exercises, melodicism, and Floydian dreamscape; &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast,&quot; the spiky mini-suite which closes the album is less brain-bender than escapist guilty pleasure (the finale is a simple joy); and, of the three more conventional numbers, &quot;If&quot; is one of Roger Waters's few - and most affecting - love songs, &quot;Summer of '68&quot; one of Rick Wright's less straining exercises of jazz-overtoned pop, and &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; an almost classically understated Gilmour excursion into benign absurdism.<br />This was the band's first complete attempt at self-production - some of the recording is a bit on the muddy side (hence, the one-star docking), but for the most part they seemed to know what they were doing and how to do it. Perhaps that is the real key to &quot;Atom Heart Mother's&quot; underrating; they just weren't quite as facile as their own producers as they'd soon enough become.<br />As a sidebar: Hunt out the side collaboration between Roger Waters and the band's &quot;Atom Heart Mother Suite&quot; collaborator, Ron Geesin, &quot;Music From The Body&quot;. As an exercise in absurdist electronic song experimentation, it is interesting if nothing else.
B000002KD9|5.0|Neil Young's After The Goldrush is a brilliant, cerebral and often difficult miracle of an album. It's almost impossible not to be swept up in the powerful emotions, sentiments and ideas expressed in this album. All the way from the provocative cover art to the scathing classic 'Southern Man', it would be a bad idea for any rock fan to pass on this one.
6303823351|5.0|The FIRST time I saw the &quot;Help&quot; movie with the Beatles was on top of my parent's station-wagon at a drive-in theatre with my 3 brothers on the top of the car with me.We were all of <BR>&quot;youngins&quot;, but the Beatles, and all their movies still are with me, and my bro's! The main theme of &quot;The Ring&quot; is the best memory,with the music being second. The Beatles are the only lead performers that could do this movie the way it was so great, and humuorosly performed; not to mention musically memorable!<BR>That's why I have to have a copy!<BR>If not for my kids...FOR ME!   :)
B00005JKZT|4.0|putting me to sleep?<br />Okay. The first one did, too. I really enjoyed the parts when I wasn't dozing off. Gollum is absolutely engaging and wonderfully realized. He was my favorite character in the movie--indeed, in both episodes combined.  It was a mistake for Gimli to be the comic relief. Rhys-Davies just isn't up to it. In that regard, we have what I think is the only serious flaw in Part II--the lack of a sufficiently \\"light\\" character to add depth and pleasure to the film.<br />Then again--yawn--why did I find myself nodding off at various points? Could it be that this movie is too long? Heaven forbid! Could it be that the battle scene was stretched out to the point of being, well, exhausting and a bit over-cooked? Not possible! Might it be that the \\"American Express\\" commercial look and feel (reminiscent of moments from the hideous \\"Gladiator\\") to the flashbacks triggered a nascent narcolepsy? How could that be?!<br />Let's call this film for what it is. A fine movie, but certainly not an example of any sort of economy--of time, of plot, of action, or of scenery. But, given the need to convert Tolkein's legendary books to the screen, the central flaw in them has joined us for the ride. The Lord of the Rings books, for all their wonder, are, well, a bit on the boring side for long stretches. You'd have to be a Middle Earth glutton to think otherwise.<br />One thing this movie, and the first, did well is to show that the ring is technology and mastery over the world, and that our lust for it--so appropos in today's day and age--is going to lead to our destruction. Few, ironically, seem to get it. Fewer still understand that Tokien, a luddite of the first order, was condemning the engine of modern Europe and, more pointedly, America, where in a few short years we've acquired more Gollums (can you say, \\"Bill Gates,\\" but certainly the rest of us, too) than one might have ever imagined. Here's to empty-hearted, lustful, compelling, dehumanizing, and meaningless attraction to progress, science, and money!<br />Just don't look in the mirror too long.ttraction to progress, science, and money! <br />Just don't look in the mirror too long.
6304595247|1.0|I admire the actors in this film so much that I would like really to be able to say that this is a very good film.  Unhappily, it is not.  I admit that I have not read the book, but I want to.  I hope that it is better than this film.  Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche are very good actors and they were very young when they made this - but they are both not very good.  They are &quot;trying too hard&quot;, I think.  Others actors in the film are better, but it is in the whole not a good film.  The countryside is beautiful and filmed in Yorkshire, I think, and the nusic is lovely - but I think this is not a film to buy.
0684803356|4.0|Hemingway expertly begins this book with John Donne's poem... \\"No Man is an Island...\\" The main theme of this story, to me, is centered around our connection to others. No matter if they are right down the street or across the Atlantic Ocean from us. As Donne said... (I paraphrase weakly) \\"Whenever someone in mankind is hurting, it hurts me because I am part of mankind and mankind is part of me.\\"<br /> This book has several interesting elements:<br />1. Robert Jordan's strong sense of duty.<br />Why does a Spanish professor from Montana decide to leave his obiviously comfortable life to fight with the anti facist guerillas in a far away country? What compels him to give up himself so completely to fight for a people that he seemingly has no connections to? Where does Robert's commitment to duty come from? These questions are addressed and answered expertly by Hemingway in the thought process of Robert, conversations he has and lived out in his very relationships.<br />The book is dominated by Robert's \\"thinking out\\" of his actions in the face of what he has to do. I really enjoyed this facet of the story. I think it adds to the length of the novel but it is definitely worth reading.<br />2. The demise of Pablo's sense of duty and passion.<br />When we meet Pablo in this story, he is a man on the downside of his effectiveness. He no longer has convicitons. He no longer has a will to accoplish his goals. Pablo's lack of determination plays directly against Robert's and Pablo's wife Pilar. It is interesting to look at Pablo, the old leader of the rebel band... and how he is losing his influence over these people. His pride even causes him at times to hurt the anti facist cause, which he once felt so strongly about. Robert and Pilar are both on fire for the cause and it consumes them. Pablo has lost all his fire for the cause and is now apparently useless. (Pablo does experience some redemption in the end...)<br />3. The blossoming relationship between Robert and Maria. Love in the face of impending doom.<br />I'm not usually a big romance guy... at least in the books I read. But the love story between Robert and Maria is beautiful.<br />It grows out of a most impossible situation, Robert the foreign freedom fighter finds Maria the ravaged former war prisoner. She does not necessarily look beautiful on the outside but Robert loves her anyway. He loves who she is, and what she becomes to him.<br />Interesting internal discussions happen for Robert about her. I love the one that talks about how he has to in essence live a whole life with Maria in 3 days. All because he is unsure of whether he will live to have a life with her after the war. These two people really loved each other and would do anything for each other.<br />4. The ultimate sacrifice... Self sacrifice.<br />I don't want to get into the details of the conclusion of the story. Hate to spoil a good read. But the theme of self sacrifice comes through loud and clear. To me, this is the theme of life. We make a real difference when we give up on our sense of self and make an impact on others. Whether they are people we are closely and intimatly related to, or people we have never seen before. Robert Jordan gets it... he puts others first and gives up all he has.<br />Read this book... it is a rewarding experience. It is a war novel, but you will notice I rarely mentioned the war. It is so much more than a war novel. I loved it ... I think you will too.the face of impending doom.<BR>I'm not usually a big romance guy... at least in the books I read.

B00005QIPH|4.0|As a 45 year old, I have been through my share of hyped music that I did not initially like....like this guy named Bruce Springsteen that came out when I was in high school.. <br />What I have learned is that some of those bands end up getting better with time. Hindsight shows them to be artists that define a trend or influence a whole sound. I guess The Strokes are this to me. I am not that enamoured with them, but I can see where they have something special. Only time will tell if that is a defining style, or just a fad. I'll listen to them a bit more to see if the hook sets.<br />As far as all the attention to the fact that certain bands start with \\"The\\"....what the hell is that fuss all about. The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Cars,.... I mean, it is not like it is a new idea. To group a bunch of bands because they start with \\"The\\" just seems ridiculous.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I've always liked Pink's music, but after listening to this album, I can honestly say that I AM A TRUE FAN! It seemed as if Pink were digging out my inner feelings that were once surpressed and re-surfacing them. Yes, at times...it got quite depresing, but it allowed me to begin assessing these issues one step at a time instead of bottling them all up. With this album, you can really tell Pink has gone through an emotional roller-coaster which just proves that shes just like all of us...
B00006RAKP|1.0|Elton John comes out with a new greatest hits CD every other year it seems but the song Funeral for a Friend never makes it on the CD. Until it does the greatest hits CD's from Elton John will always be considered partial greatest hits to me.<br />Sorry you old Queen but that's the way it is.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Probably the biggest group to assemble ever, Audioslave had high expectations from their fans before recording began.  Then the wait was over.  My god was it worth it.  Here's a summary<br />1.  Cochise - An incredibly hard, fresh, intense headbanger.  Probably the hardest, fastest, loudest, most incredible 3:42 ever recorded.<br />2. Show Me How To Live - An intense, loud, rip-roaring song.  The most powerful chorus I have ever heard.  Intense, great rock song.<br />Gasoline - Great song.  Great guitar intro, great lyrics, great headbanging beat.  Very very hard rock song.  Very good song<br />What You Are - An anthem of personal liberation.  This song is for those who will never back down, and never give up.  Incredibly great song.  Listen to those lyrics.  My  favorite on the album.<br />Like A Stone - Great, moody song.  Never expected a song this beautiful and deep.  Very intense, incredibly done.<br />Set It Off - Oh My God.  The absolute most powerful lyrics I have ever heard in a song.  Great, loud, very intense.  Listen to that second verse.<br />Shadow On The Sun - Starts of slow, picks up intensity with unforgettable last minute.  Very great song.<br />I Am The Highway - Incredible song.  Second best on the album.  Very liberating, personal song, with great hook and incredible guitar.<br />Exploder - Explosive song.  Just a blast of pure energy.  Hard, hard song with a story at it's core.  Great song.<br />Hypnotize - Great drumwork.  very good song.  Good lyrics.<br />Bring Em Back Alive - Personal, hard, great lyrics, intense guitar solo.  What more could you want.<br />Light My Way - Intense, hard song.  Great chorus, strong guitar.  Those last 2 minutes are priceless.<br />Getaway Car - Great song.  Incredible hook, great guitar.  Should be next single.  Just a great song.<br />The Last Remaining Light - Great closer.  Great lyrics at the chorus.  Great close to a great album.<br />All in all, my favorite album of all time.  Just absolutely incrediblestuff.  Not one bad song.  Just brilliant
0425173755|5.0|This was definatly one of Christie's best mysterys. She made it so everything was intertwined with one event and made it so you were always guessing. It just starts a little slow, but that's all that was wrong. It has something that makes you keep reading from the very begining and not put it down. I definatly like Christie's way of doing mysteries and wish she was still at it.
B00003CXAE|3.0|If you're in your 30s, as I am, this is probably one of the first films you saw as a kid without your parents. That sense of independence which a lot of us former Gen-Xers associate with this film means it will always have a special place in our hearts. <BR>  Watching the film at an older age, you still can't help but be pulled in by its energy. For if the title song says, \\"Grease is the word,\\" a better word to describe this film is energy. You really feel all the excitement of these characters in their high school senior year.<BR>   Olivia Newton-John, who appeared to have lost all her acting talent after this film, is very convincing as Sandy. Travolta plays his part very well, too, helping to create the memorable chemistry between the two main characters.  Jeff Conaway, Stockard Channing, Didi Conn, Sid Caesar, Alice Ghostley, Eve Arden, all give memorable turns as well.<BR>  The gripe is, Paramount could have done a better job with this video. First of all, while they restored the Gulf & Western logo at the beginning of \\"Saturday Night Fever,\\" it's not included here.  And the special feature is a few years old. Considering this is not a bargain-priced DVD, the studio needs to do more to justify the higher price of this item.
B00005RFAI|4.0|This is a great CD full of energy and fun. It skips from funky, fast and catchy techno/hip-hop tracks like    &quot;M!ssundaztood&quot;, &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; and &quot;Respect&quot;, to pop/rock tunes such as &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot;, &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot; and &quot;18-Wheeler&quot;, to soft, deep emotional songs like &quot;Gone to California&quot;.       Bottom line: A very fun disc with great vocals by the ultra-hot Pink.      Grade=B+
B00003CWTI|2.0|I rented this film only the other night - I had no idea as to what it was about, but I figured 'hey the cast looks okay, might be good!'.  For the first hour I was riveted, not because anything particularly...riveting happened! But simply because I was intrigued as to how all of these bizarre, dark and sinister plot lines would all converge later on in the film.  <br />Only they never did (not to my mind anyway).  Yes there were readily identifiable moral 'themes' that linked the various sub plots - namely forgiveness, truth, faith, co-incidence and fate.  Which is nice, but hardly worthy of the 3 hours I spent waiting for that one all mighty scene or line that just summed the whole film up and made you say 'yeah I get it!'.  Perhaps there was nothing to get?  And the ending left me quite frankly scratching my head.  Clearly some reference to acts of God, miracles, yadayada.  But it seemed a half baked way of bringing it all together at best, especially seeing as references to religion were few and far between throughout the main body of the film, and the various lifestyles we were shown were on the whole godless and really just a bit twisted.  So the '10 plagues' thing really didn't work for me.<br />The acting was...okay.  I was pleasantly surprised at times by Tom Cruise, although, if he was even half as bored making the film as I was watching it, then perhaps those intense tears of frustration were for real.  Poor guy.  Juliet Moore remains my least favourite of actresses - you'd think they could of splashed some lemon juice in her eyes to make it all a bit more convincing.  The rest did an okay job, but were not given equal amounts of time throughout the film to allow us to identify with their character beyond the vague glimpses of their lives we were so graciously given from time to time.    <br />I don't know - I'm one of these people that would rather go see a painting of a house as opposed to a glass display cabinet containing half filled glasses of water that are meant to represent a house through 'deep' and 'meaningful' implicit artistic statements.  Magnolia just struck me as 'wierd for wierds sake'.  Film critics will inevitably de-construct a film such as this and bring out all these hidden meanings and messages, when actually they should just consider the likelyhood that there is no hidden meaning, there is no hidden message.  It's just nonsensical wierdness.<br />My two cents.
B000065U1N|1.0|I only watched this film because a friend told me it was a good portrayal of the horrors of war. It is not. It is an attempt to legitimise a US mission in a sovereign state that caused the deaths of 10,000 Somali civilians. From the outset, the natives are portrayed as animals and terrorists, when the real terrorists were the foreigners (US) who invaded their country and took sides in a civil war that was none of their business. Of course, Ridley Scott doesn't tell it like this. He portrays the US terrorists as \\"heroes\\" and spends more time weeping over the deaths of 18 US soldiers than he does over the deaths of 10,000 Somali civilians. He portrays the US mission as \\"humanitarian\\", when its real purpose was to install America's preferred puppet and gain control over lawlesss Somalia. If you care about the truth, I'd advise you to avoid this film...
B00003CX8J|5.0|This movie has two of the best from across the Atlantic who help define and recreate actual characters from a comic book.  The graphics make the stories seem real.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|First of all, this film is not for serious film purists, unless you enjoy the total absurdity of life at large. Yeah, it's a parody, but it's so much better than the many films it parodies (Scream, I Know What You Did...etc.). The Wayans always only want to have fun, and I respect comparisons to ZAZ and the Farrely's.  Aside from inspired casting (Ric Ducommun as the dad and Lochlyn Munro as the helpless cameraman), the others take this script (no doubt with loads of improv) to great levels. Anna Faris should win an award somewhere, if only because she played this whole idiot role with a straight face and ultimate conviction; she's a riot, a rare comedian who doesn't pretend to to be funny. A real natural! Regina Hall is particularly delightful when she's being intimate with Roy, but all he wants is to see her in his football outfit. The rapid-fire script adds to this when she's in the theatre and annoys everyone...my favorite was when the Pope jumps up and says \\"You ruined \\"Big Momma's House\\" (how many people caught that?). I don't know; it's so funny ALL the time, and repeated viewings make me find new stuff to laugh at. The good looking Dave Sheridan made himself look so goofy as Doofy, and I appreciated Andrea Nemeth's performance as Heather as a direct take-off of Reese Witherspoon in \\"ELECTION\\", a really fine film.  Cheri Oteri, the Wayans guys, Shannon Elizabeth...all a treat. Everything about this film is a treat, if you know how to kick back and mellow. If you don't know the films it's parodying, it will still make you laugh...unless you're so jaded that you've forgotten how...
B000068TPN|3.0|The show is truly well done and entertaining.  It is action packed and well performed by the actors and actresses.<br />However, I do not think I would purchase it again if I had it to do over again.  The movie itself gets a high rating, but it is not the type of show that I want to watch over and over again.<br />It is a renter -- a great renter in fact -- but still a renter.  For example, Vietnam movies that I like to watch over and again (Hamburger Hill, Apocalypse Now redux, etc.) deal with what happenned, the holistic tragedy if you will.  This movie ends with a phyrric victory in the first engagement between the VC and the USA.<br />I do not believe it adequately adresses the initial issues of Vietnam.  The lies about the Gulf of Tonkin did not have to be elicited, mind you; however, the only vague historical background relates to the prior French occupation.  The slaughtering and cold blooded assisination of French troops (with the line \\"kill them all, keep killing them and they will stop coming. . .\\") points to the Vietnamese willingness to win a war of attrition prior to our ever being involved.  After that, the movie narrows simply to the battle.  The \\"historical issues\\" are mainly emotional reactions of wives who lose their husbands.<br />Again, the actresses who mourn do a splendid job of bringing home the reality that war equals death, and that death has an impact beyond the loss of one life.  I do not, however, need a whole lot of that.  I prefer some geo-political power playing or statement regarding the times.  A simple moral about collateral and emotional pain and suffering after the battle could be accomplshed in less time.<br />Thus, the best part of the show is the battle.  I love the battle scenes, and if they are enough for you, then buy it; however, this is not something essential to a collection in my opinion.  My favorite movies are action films, but I want more out of my histories.
B000003TAR|5.0|This, and Nevermind are the two very best Nirvana albums.  Songs such as Pennyroyal Tea, Rape me,and Heart-Shaped box are instant classics!!Not to mention, this was the last album that the whole group of Nirvana made, before the death of Kurt Cobain.  Buy this, and Nevermind if you want classic, pure, and great Nirvana or Grunge/Punk music!
B00005JKZT|5.0|I definitely believe that LOTR:TTT was exceptional.  The intro about what happened to Gandalf after the fall was a great way to start off the movie.  It reminded us about past events but didn't delve too much into that.  After reading the book, the first thing I wondered was how they were going to divide the movie up.  The book was divided into two separate parts, with three different groups.  Peter Jackson did a very good job with the transitions.  For example, when Aragorn was tracing the Hobbits' steps into the forest, the scene suddenly switches to the part when Merry and Pippin are running in the forest.  Many people have said how many parts of the book were excluded and changed, but you have to keep in mind that it is already 3 hours long.  If they added more, the audience would be sitting there for an entire day.  Overall, the movie was wonderful, and I would pay to see it again.

B00000099Y|5.0|Initially, i enjoyed Tool when they first came out, and realized they were good, but then this album came around and i was shocked!  It was awesome!  Maynard James Keenan hits all the vocal notes right on target, and he now sounds alot more mature, with a mans voice, rather than a teenage boy's voice.  If you like Tool, or any form of rock music, you need to at least listen to this album!

B00006LSM3|5.0|\\"Brainwashed\\" is a fitting coda to the great yet sublime, musical genius of George Harrison. Unlike anything you'll hear in contemporary music-land, \\"Brainwashed\\" is infused with spritiually tinged melodies, sly lyrics and \\"plenty of that guitar\\".

My favourites, besides the radio-friendly \\"Any Road\\", \\"Stuck inside a cloud\\", \\"P2 Vatican Blues\\" and the title track \\"Brainwashed\\", include \\"Rising Sun\\" a haunting paen to spiritual awakening and the hymnlike ballad \\"Pisces Fish\\".

Because of this I was at first disappointed with my purchase, but after I saw how much my son loves it I quickly changed my mind.

B00005JLS0|5.0|This is another romance comedy attempt of Sandra Bullock after Miss Congeniality. This time we have the \\"everlasting\\" Hugh Grant to co-star with Sandra in this love and hatred, boss and employee relationship movie. Sandra as a Harvard law grad with a law professor mother devoted her life to justice, helping the poor and preserving the community against the rage of large corporations. In an attempt to save the community centre, she accepted the offer of her dead enemy Hugh Grant's offer to help him as his consultant in return for preserving the community centre during the development of the area. The story kicks off from that, and there are lots of funny and minute details that can drive the audience laugh. Sandra's character is funny, though at times you can still find traces of the cop she played in Miss Congeniality (which is something she needs to pay attention to). Hugh Grant is surprisingly fit for the character as a nasty and self-centred boss, who finally realised what he needs is a bossy women to whom he could relied on. His lines were delivered with wit. The screeplay is well written with all the good killing gags that can tickle your heart. All the supporting characters are very good too, especially Sandra's parents in the movie, they are splendid. It is an entertaining and warm movie to spend time on, it can make you feel good for a while.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is one the best Rap albums of all time. This on the same level as \\"The Chronic\\" it's hard to say which is better. This is a hip-hop classic without a doubt every song is amazing. A lot of the songs on this album are overplayed (especially on the West Coast) but it doesn't really matter. There are really good songs on this album that arn't heard on the radio too often. My favorite songs are Lodi Dodi, The Shiznit, Murder Was the Case, Doggy Dogg World, and G'z Up Ho's Down. There are also the CLASSIC Joints: Gin and Juice, What's My Name, and Ain't No Fun. I don't understand how any hip-hop fan could not like this CD. Snoop has never even come close to making an album that can even been compared with this, This is his only album that was entirely produced by Dr. Dre, and it will probobly be the only one. It's rare now-a-days for a well-known rapper to make an album that is produced by one person which i think is unfortunate. It seems like every album now has a song produced by the Neptunes, Timbaland, Jermain Dupri, or Just Blaze. I think that if Snoop ever wants to come close to making another album as good as \\"Doggystyle\\" he needs to get with Dr. Dre and nobody else.
B0000013G9|5.0|The reason I gave this cd 5 stars is that I can listen to it from start to finish without skipping a single track.  It's a very cohesive album, flowing very smoothly.  Standout tracks to me are : Creep, If I was your Girlfriend, Waterfalls, Red Light Special, Something Wicked This Way and Switch.  The raps by Lisa Lopes are just plain great, specially in the Switch and Waterfalls.  Outkast make a great appearance also.
0441346642|5.0|Basically, this is another cute children's book. The important characters have well developed personalities, such as Howl, whose behavior becomes quite predictable because of his well developed persona. The story is Sophie was shy and never thought she'd become anything special until a witch turns her into an old woman. She finds Howl, lives in his castle, and 'does chores' for him. It's an impossibly cute love story, and a good book on the whole.
0060977493|4.0|This is the story of a set of twins, Rahel & Estha who are separated when they are 9 years old after the tragic death of their cousin, Rahel remaining with her mother's family and Estha shipped off to his father.  Twenty three years later they are reunited in the family home in Kerala, India and begin  the slow process of reconnecting with each other and recovering the memories of what happened.<br />While this novel is set in India and involves the reader in politics I would not recommend such a sad book to \\"get to know\\" India, rather this book is about a dysfunctional family, extreme childhood trauma and the terrible things ordinary human beings can do to each other. The caste system and untouchability is illegal, but is still a strong social influence in the time and place of this story. <br />The author's imagery and style of writing is unusual, she has really captured the innocence of children, I felt I was seeing things through the eyes of a child, a world of colors & larger than life events.  The writing slips fluidly between past and present. <br />I rated this 4 stars because I didn't care for the ending, which seemed rushed to me and lacked a sense of closure.  Like other reviewers here I felt the sexual scene between the twins to be incongruous with the rest of the story, also I was disappointed that Baby Kochamma seemed to get off too lightly.
B000067CPX|5.0|When the Red Hot Chili Peppers first hit the music scene, they were indeed a bad boy Alternative rock act. Whereas the band has retained some of those funky and rapping styles as well as some Explicit lyrics, the style on the By The Way CD is so much more melodic and even mature. This CD actually has many classic rock overtones and the many changes of pace really have me hooked.<br />Sixteen songs on this CD and not a bad one in the lot. Heck the worst songs I would rate as good and many of them are great. The title track is super catchy with its many hooks. The rap parts are ultra cool. Can't Stop, Throw Away Your Television, and On Mercury are loaded with funky stylings and some tasty guitar and keyboard parts. Not too mention Flea's tasteful bass licks on the Television tune. Some great softer more melodic tunes such as Tear, The Zephyr Song, and Dosed stand tall on this disc as well. The great thing about these particular tunes is that they don't sound sappy in any way. The band just explores more structure here and the harmonies and instrumentation are extremely ear catching.<br />Some fans may dissappointed that the Chili Peppers may have softened their appeal a bit. However, these people need to realize that change is good otherwise bands become yesterdays news all too quickly.<br />My verdict here is to pick this CD up at once. If you wrote off the Chili Peppers in the past for being a bit too hard core, you might want to try this one on as it has more elements for classic rock fans.
B0000399WI|5.0|I have watched the Shawshank Redemption more than 10 times. I haven't gotten tired of watching it yet. This movie is amazing and the story of two men who meet up in an unlikely place in an unlikely way makes me feel hopeful that such moments will happen for me. Andy and Red are the most mesmerizing pair of friends that anybody would want to see. Andy has the faith and hope of young children with dreams of becoming presidents and kings/queens. Red has wisdom and just enough hope in his friend Andy to barrel through any obstacles.<br />The loss of innocence and freedom are common themes found throughout movies, literature, and life. Shawshank brings these major themes into focus allowing the audience to hope and dream with the characters. Even the supporting characters carry a magical life of their own. This has to be one of the best book-based Stephen King movies made.<br />If you like good movies you'll love this movie. It even has Rita Hayworth for you classic fans.
B0000542DJ|4.0|Of course..JFK is an amazing movie but the best thing about buying it on DVD is the director's commentary. Oliver Stone practically offers us a complete 2nd screenplay and talks enough facts to fill a class's worth of material. If I was a teacher, I would play the director's commentary to my students. It's THAT informative. Fascinating.<br />JFK on DVD is truly rare in that this is one of the FEW movies out there that really offers something substantive on DVD...you know...truly exploits what DVD is all about. There still is some useless stuff in the DVD such as &quot;interactive menus&quot; (useless), &quot;multimedia essays&quot; (haven't seen them), &quot;deleted/extended scenes&quot; (kind of interesting, but useless because they are worth watching once and not worth paying extra for).<br />There indeed is &quot;filler&quot; in this DVD but the director's commentary is absolutely worth the listen. If you are at all interested in the movie JFK, I cannot help but believe that you will be absolutely riveted by Stone's comments.
B000000H3Z|5.0|This album kicks ... !!! if you love fast, evil , dark and in your face black metal and thrash  and speed metal buy this!
B00003CXMG|5.0|Glad that the producers decided to release the single-disc version, not forcing 100% of the people to buy the 3 disc &quot;special edition&quot; for 35 bucks. <br />The only reason I want the single-disc version is because the movie itself is the artwork. Nothing else the producers throw in is art. Documentaries, while interesting, only hold my attention for a single viewing, and therefore don't make it worth my while to pay double for that sort of &quot;extra.&quot; Deleted scenes, too, are interesting, but I NEVER watch them more than once.<br />Generalization: there is nothing besides the movie that is worthy of a 2nd viewing, and therefore it is not worth paying for.<br />Back to the movie. <br />An absolutely excellent, warm film. Glad I was able to buy this as a single disc version only, or I would not have bought it (but at least I would have saved my money).
B000069AUI|5.0|I bought this CD only because I liked the song 'Clocks' so much.  Oh my gosh, I absolutely love this CD.  Sure some songs are stronger than others but this whole CD is good.  How many CD's can you say that about?  Very few.  I'm a huge U2 fan but there are always 3 or 4 songs on every one of their CD's that I just don't like.  Not true of this CD.  Buy it, give it a FEW listens from beginning to end and you will fall in love with it.<br />I love finding a new band and CD to like this much!
0316666343|5.0|The story was told  from the perspective of a 14-year old Susie from heaven, after she was brutally murdered by a neighbour.  From heaven, she watched the lives of her family and friends on Earth. Each of them had their grieve, pain and loss to cope with, and their lives to move on.  <br />The story was extraordinarily moving and emotive, yet never gloomy.  It has the power to reduce the reader to tears.
B00006J3WH|4.0|This could of been a failure. It could of flopped and died horribly. But then again, Joss Whedon was the one behind it, and you never question Joss Whedon and his genius. If this were some other show runned by some other writer/producer/director, it probably wouldn't have worked. It probably would have been cheesy and used just for the hell of it. &quot;Xena&quot; anyone?. We all know that isn't the way it's done in the &quot;Buffy&quot; universe. What Joss and the cast have done here is something amazing and breathtaking. It's unlike anything else that a television show has ever tried to do. Has ever had the guts to do. The musical concept of it wasn't just for ratings. Wasn't just for the fun of it. It was integral to the plot. It was connected with all of the story arcs that were going on at that particular time on the show, and it continued the process of those songs. It moved them along. It had a point. It had a purpose. If your going into this not having been following the show or hadn't seen the musical show, then you might not get some things. Here's a bit of a lowdown. Buffy died at the end of the previous season and her friends resurrected her at the start of this one. Buffy was in heaven and she was happy. She thinks being back on this earth is the real hell. She and Spike also have a growing relationship between them that no one else knows about. That's pretty much the whole of it. There are side storylines about Xander and Anya's relationship and their new engagement and upcoming wedding. This CD is unlike anything I've heard before. The musicianship is astounding. The cast don't all have the greatest singing voices, but they all make the best of it and pull it off. Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar, is no Celine Dion, but she sounds relaxed and comfortable. Nicholas Brendon(Xander), and Alyson Hannigan(Willow), probably have the least vocal talent of the cast here. They do what they can. There are three cast members here who do have wonderful vocalchops. Anthony Stewart Head(Giles), has the most seasoned voice. Everyone who watches the show knows he can sing because his character has dabbled with it a bit on the show in the later seasons. He even released a CD this past year on his own as well. James Marsters(Spike), the cool Billy Idol vamp is impressive as well. His song &quot;Rest In Peace&quot;, is the best track on the whole CD. It's ghoulish, in keeping with the show and his character, but sounds like classic rock and roll as well. It's a huge highlight. It's as if he and the character of Spike were born to be rock stars. The other one of the three is Amber Benson(Tara). She proves, on her song &quot;Under Your Spell&quot;, that she just may very well be heads and shoulders above everyone else. Emma Caufield(Anya)is no slouch either. Her riff on bunnies(which her character is deathly afraid of)during the second track &quot;I've Got A Theory&quot;, is another highlight. Albeit a comical one. As I've said, each song has a meaning. Okay, maybe not &quot;The Parking Ticket&quot;, or &quot;The Mustard&quot;, both of which are under a minute long, but the rest do. It's all connected to what has happened and what is happening now. It moves the story and the characters along. The music on the CD sounds every bit as good as a real musical. The music is top notch and beautifully handled. Some of it is big, brassy, and campy, but that's the way it should be. Expertly done. One has already known of Joss Whedon's brilliance, but you have to give the guy even more credit. He wrote the lyrics and music for every song on here. That is above and beyond the call of duty. Let's see David E. Kelley do that. In fact, let's see anyone do that. There are also some bonus tracks here from past episodes. It's all lovely and exciting instrumental music from The fourth season's groundbreaking episodes &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Restless&quot;. The fifth season finale &quot;The Gift&quot; has a song from it on here too. The final track is a demo version of &quot;Something To Sing About&quot;, sung by Joss's wife Kai Cole, and piano from Joss himself. What a fine voice she has!. The other best track on here is &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;. Try not playing the chorus part in your head after you see it. You can't!. This is exceptional work from an exceptionally brilliant and groundbreaking series. One of the most accomplished pieces of television ever. If only the rest of TV could be as bold and daring. Nobody does it better than Buffy. Nobody ever will.
0380725398|4.0|Some reviewers were more critical than I.  If a book causes me to be anxious to get home to read it, than I give it 4 stars. Now I will describe what specifically I liked about Jamaica Inn:<BR> 1. The characters were fairly 3-dimensional.<BR>2. DuMaurier's descriptions made me smell and visualize the Inn, the moors and the characters.<BR>3. I couldn't predict what each character would state next, nor what what actually transpire next.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|I remember watching sporadic parts of this movie a ling time agao when I was too young to really understand it.  But now that I got a new dvd player, I decided to buy this DVD becasue AKIRA is considered to be &quot;THE&quot; anime movie of all time.  They don't make these like they used to, only short 60 minute films are the craze in the anime world, so this 2 hour epic is truly a work of art in the anime world.  The picture of a boy walking up to his bike may sway viewers, but this is not a &quot;bike&quot; movie, it is a work of art (did I already say that?).  Some people have complained about the redubbing, I think it is a vast improvement over the original voices:  more mature and a better &quot;full&quot; script.  If you are an anime fan then check out this DVD!
B00006SFBD|4.0|From the first second of music on this excellent cd, you can't help to notice that it's the heaviest album they ever recorded.<BR>If there used to be a mix between Black Metal and Death Metal, it is now gone. Opeth are fully Death Metal, they make an excellent fusion of Death Metal, Progressive compositions, odd-time signatures and very emotional and touching melodies in the vein of Porcupine Tree. Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree has produced this album like their previous amazing \\"Blackwater Park\\" and also takes part in clean vocals. This cd is different from \\"Blackwater Park\\" though, its much heavier, the melodies are less catchier and the songs are a bit more complex in my opinion. In case you've never had a chanse to listen to Opeth before, I'd recommend you'll pick \\"Morningrise\\", \\"Still Life\\" or \\"Blackwater Park\\" before you get near this one. <BR>But if you already are farmiliar and fond of Opeth's excellent music, I can assure you no dissapointance.
B00000255F|3.0|This is just an ok album.  No more, no less.  The bombastic production and atmosphere paint an impressive portrait of the joys of being young, reckless, and \\"on fire\\" in 1974 New Jersey, and Bruce does a good job of coming up with flowery lyrics to suit that portrait.  Roy Bittan, his piano player, is a fantastic musician; he's the real star of the album.  Other than that, Born to Run falls well short of the standard set by The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, Bruce's previous album.  The main problem is in the songwriting; there's little to no hook or catchiness in half the songs.  Only \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\" strike me as perfect pieces of pop music.  \\"Backstreets\\" is an adequate rave-up, and \\"Jungleland\\" is a spectacular, theatrical album-ender, my pick for the best song on the album.  Other than that, he's stuck in an musical rut, especially on the boring opener, \\"Thunder Road.\\"  Any of you who aren't familiar with Bruce yet, PLEASE hear The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle first before you pick up this one.  Yes, I know, Born to Run was his breakthrough album, but that doesn't mean it's THAT incredible.
B00005OWEG|3.0|This movie gets a three because the original theatrical release is almost a five. This movie is just a waste of money and time. It claims to have exclusive added footage, which it does, but that does not make it a good thing. Actually the added footage is what makes this movie so horrible. What is so horrible about the added footage? Well it is 20 minutes of Marlon Brando mumbling to Charlie Sheen. I remember renting this on DVD and enjoying it until it reached the added footage of Marlon babbling. If you are a fan of Apocalypse Now and want to add it to your DVD collection or even your VHS collection, then buy the original release without the added scenes.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|An oft-overlooked comedy from the mid-eighties, \\"The Money Pit\\" is the story of a yuppie couple who end up pouring every dime they have into fixing up what LOOKED like their dream house when they bought it, only to find out that it is just one strong breeze away from falling apart.  The ensuing story is a series of comical construction mishaps, shady contractors, teetering relationships, and some of Tom Hanks' best slapstick performances.  Of note, the scene where the bathtub falls through the floor and Hanks looks down on it in a fit of desperate laughter, and the scene where Hanks is trapped in a rug that has fallen through yet another hole in the floor.<br />Look for a small part by a then-barely-known Joseph Mantegna.<br />The comedy never quite fires on all cylinders, but it charms and entertains you nonetheless.<br />This is probably Richard Benjamin's second best directorial effort, next to the untouchable \\"My Favorite Year\\".
B00005QDW1|4.0|Hardcore fans just might hate this record. And they'd have good reason to -- it's a far cry from the beauty of Tragic Kingdom, or even the smooth, dark melodies of Return of Saturn.<br />Instead, No Doubt has cashed in on their recent pop stardom and created an album that they have been quoted as saying 'A record fun to dance to'. I have to agree with them on that -- this is a fun listen, and surprising coming from No Doubt. I originally hated it as a diehard No Doubt fan, but as more singles were sent out on the radio airwaves, I broke down and got the record.  It's actually a great, fun listen.<br />'Hey Baby' is mindless pop fun with a catchy beat that pokes fun at the groupies of the concerts. 'Hella Good' is a thumping, bombastic bass-driven song that's all about dancing, and it definitely creates a beat that's hard not to dance to.  'Underneath it All' was a surprising song, to me, as it didn't seem particularly special, but the more I listened to it, the more it appealed, and now I think it's my favorite on the album entirely. It's typical Gwen lyrics -- talking about her relationship and how it's not perfect, but it's still a good thing. 'Platinum Blonde Life' is frothy fun as well, with a California rock feel to it, and you can just imagine blondes riding around in convertibles with this blasting on the radio.<br />There were a few songs that I disliked on the album -- 'Waiting Room' and 'Start the Fire' to name two. They were just hard to sit through, and still didn't catch my ear after several listens.<br />It'll grow on you, and it's a fun, lighthearted album for No Doubt, but fans looking for something a little meatier (hinted at by the title) will be disappointed. This is not a rock album like Tragic Kingdom. If that's what you're looking for, skip Rock Steady, you won't miss it. If you're a fan of driving pop melodies and just want something fun to pop into the CD player, Rock Steady is a good choice.
B00005JKZT|2.0|I have read these books many times.  I learned of them many years ago because I was doing research on a certain author; the research lead me to C. S. Lewis and so on to Tolkien. I truly wished I could inhabit this wonderful place that Tolkien \\"discovered.\\" I was/am like Sam: I would dearly love to meet the Elves.  They were Tolkien's favorites, and the details that he created for them reveals that. <br />\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" would rate 5 stars from me; I, too, noticed omissions of incidents, and I wondered how certain situations would be resolved because of those omissions/changes.<br />I bought my ticket ASAP and went to \\"The Two Towers\\" on the first day at the first showing and left feeling \\"leaden.\\"  Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli are still acted very well.  Sean Astin is a wonderful Sam; in fact, I think Sam is the ultimate hero of the LOTR.  All the hobbit actors are very good, but I do not think Merry and Pippin will be given the chance to be the heroes they were in the books.  Why did Faramir take Frodo, Sam, and Gollum?  He would have been more noble than his brother Boromir if he had let Frodo and all depart to continue on their way to Mordor.  Elves at Helm's Deep?  Where were the trees who destroyed their enemies on the plains before Helm's Deep?  How will Eowyn prove her courage as a shield maiden of Rohan?  And most awful of all:  Frodo confronting a mounted Ringwraith.<br />The battle scenes at Helm's Deep are full of action which will please many viewers.  And Legolas at his crucial moment?  It's inconsistent. <br />My son and I agree in our disappointment.  If someone asks about the movie, I say \\"sure, go see it,\\" but I can't rave about it.  Each person must decide for him/herself.<br />I have very mixed feelings about \\"The Return of the King.\\"  I want to like the 3rd movie! But will I?
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ignore the slutty clothing and the piercings. Ignore the overdone makeup and the weird hats and hair. Those are just to grab your attention anyways. And now that she's got it, you should listen to her album. 'Stripped' is a great mix of R&B pop, with extremely smooth beats and catchy lyrics. And through it all, Christina's voice shines--she is truly talented.<br />'Stripped' seems to be a mix of diva-ballads and rocking, R&B based pop that's all about her new 'dirty' image. You wouldn't think it'd blend well, but it does.  On the ballads such as 'The Voice Within' and 'Beautiful' there's enough to keep the Celine/Mariah fans happy that Christina's voice has remained true. She knows how to belt out a powerful song, and there's no surprises on smooth tracks like these.  The other half of the album is all about feisty chick-power, and not taking anything lying down. Christina's attitude is alot stronger than her insipid 'Genie in a Bottle' days, and she wants you to know it. With Lil' Kim on 'Can't Hold Us Down' she speaks of sisterhood, and you believe it. 'Get Mine Get Yours' is more 'nasty' Christina attitude that seems less 'skanky' and more clever. 'Fighter' is another fun listen with lots of punch -- one of my favorite tracks on the entire record.<br />Christina's definitely come a long way, and if you ignore the trashy image she's cultivating, you'll find she's just as talented as ever, and her choices for music are bolder, and more sassy. I think we're starting to see the true Christina, musically, and she's a blast to listen to.
B00006CXSS|5.0|After watching this series, the first question that comes to mind is 'Why can't all TV be this good???'  <br />One of the first things that struck me is that while it has plenty of violence and swearing, none of it is gratuitous.  Apparently this is hard to do in war movies because it is so rarely accomplished with such wonderful results.  The story carries the day. <br />The second thing that struck me is that I didn't know squat about World War II.  I'm no genius but I have a college degree, have served in the Army, own every good war movie ever made, read 3-4 'war' books per year and watch the History channel regularily.  Yet, I was totally amazed at how little I knew about the sacrifices made by that generation of Americans and the courage that had to be displayed on a regular basis.  I'm not appreciating my public school education at the moment...<br />I highly recommend that this series be viewed after reading a couple of Stephen Ambrose's books.  In particular, if you read D-Day and Citizen Soldiers, you should have a very good base with which to then view the series to understand the 'larger picture' (i.e. the strategy, movements, major events, etc in Europe).  Don't get me wrong, this is by no way a requirement because you can enjoy the story without understanding the rest, it just makes for a better history lesson since this is based on real events.<br />Either way, I can't imagine that this series could be improved upon but I sure would like to be proved wrong!!
0743455967|5.0|In the past few months I've read book after book that tells you that you must do this, you must do that. You must write out a 300 page synopsis before you can even begin writing. You must have 90 notecards on every minor character to know where you're going. You must write a notebook full of your character's history before really knowing them inside and out. It's enough to make the budding novelist go absolutely insane!<br />I picked up Stephen King's 'On Writing' on a whim. I'm not a King fan -- my tastes are Sci/Fi & Fantasy & Romance. But I wanted to read what a bestselling author had to say about his craft, as most of the 'How To' books out there are by nobody you've ever heard of. He had me immediately hooked.<br />As a writer, this book is a must-buy. Not only do you hear about everything Stephen King struggled through to get his book published, but he also gives you tips and tricks that he's learned along the way. Don't want to write an outline? Don't. Don't want to write about your character's grandfather's past? Don't bother. It's OKAY!<br />Instead of bogging down the wannabe writer with 'surefire' methods, he discusses things most get hung up on, like dialogue, description, grammar, building characters, linking ideas, etc. He doesn't tell you that you MUST do it this particular way. Rather, he discusses what has worked for him, what he's learned through the business, and gives a few tidbits of advice along the way. It's entertaining, and it's flat out wonderful. It made me very relieved, as a stressed out writer. I went out and immediately threw away my notecards and my outlines. To heck with 'em!<br />The first half of the book deals with King's early life and his struggles to get published, and then when he has a good basis set up, he swoops into the writing do's and don'ts.<br />If you're a struggling writer that's struggling to find a decent book on the craft, please pick this one up. I cannot recommend it enough. I've read it twice already and I'm thinking about reading it again. It really is that helpful, I promise you. Not because it tells you exactly what to do, but because a bestselling author is telling you that you're NOT doing it wrong like all those other books say!hinking about reading it again. It really is that helpful, I promise you. Not because it tells you exactly what to do, but because a bestselling author is telling you that you're NOT doing it wrong like all those other books say!
B00005JL78|3.0|Worthwhile sci-fi is hard to find and for those who love the genre (and love a decent mystery), &quot;Minority Report&quot; is a fine place to start.<br />Others have thoroughly covered the plot of the film, so rather than tread where others have trod, let's look at the DVD set itself. It's a two DVD set, the second DVD being bonus material. There are two feature options, fullscreen or widescreen, so choose your film wisely. The feature disc gives a limited set of options, mostly the typical sound choices and subtitles. Nothing spectacular - no commentary tracks and such. For that you'll have to see the second disc.<br />And what a terrible disappointment the background disc is. While some bonus DVDs have in-depth  analyses of the different aspects of the film, nothing satisfies here. We are treated to little vignettes that feature interviews with crew members and cast, but they get little time to say anything or to go into any deep discussions of their particular specialty. Compare this to the &quot;Making of the 'Lord of the Rings'&quot; bonus DVDs in that set and you'll see how weak this DVD is. And where are Spielberg's comments? Well, he makes a few here and there in the various sections covered here (&quot;Minority Report: From Story to Screen&quot;, &quot;Deconstructing Minority Report&quot;, &quot;The Stunts of Minority Report&quot;,  &quot;The Digital World of Minority Report&quot; and &quot;Final Report&quot;), but they are largely inconsequential. For such a noted director and actor in a well-received movie, couldn't the DVD producers put out a better product?<br />Give the movie four stars and the DVD set two and split the difference on the rating here.
3822884979|5.0|I simply want to echo all of the positive reviews of this book. It is a visual feast; highly informative; and a wonderful value. As one reviewer previously noted, the book's only major shortcoming is the lack of picture titles.<br />By virtue of being so comprehensive, this book provides an excellent starting point for assessing the importance of pinup art in our country's recent history. No matter what you might think about the moral implications of its racier subject matter or its value as \\"serious\\" art, you cannot deny the stunning achievement of the artists represented in this volume. Almost without exception, the women depicted in this volume are endearing, sexy and spunky. The author and the publisher are to be commended for bringing this unprecedented volume to print.
B000002KIE|5.0|What can be said about this astonishing lp? <BR>punk back in 1976 was still a baby in its first few months. the seed had been planted by a Queens NY foursome named the ramones.<BR>there was no formula, no template, no guidelines. given the extremely tumultuous times mid seventies england was experiencing there was an overwhelming need for change. a voice came to a group of largely disaffected, underprivilidged youths with blue collar backgrounds. children who's parents had suffered the blows of unemployment, economic scourge and urban decay. <BR>i feel its vital that the background of this movement be described before you immerse yourselves in the sound that is the sex pistols.<BR>so what do you do if you have something to say and want to explore the theme in a sound that most would consider anti-social and unfriendly (beatles inversely).<BR>you form a group with johnny rotten as your lead singer and hire a backing band whose skills are not very well developed (glenn matlock being the only \\"professional\\" musician and ardent lover of all things beatles). <BR>you have a marketing genius take the helm and control every aspect of their affairs, his name malcolm mcclaren. <BR>even before a note is recorded you create a little controversy by moving labels three times and curse on a live british talk show. <BR>the result: NEVER MIND THE BULLOCKS HERE'S THE SEX PISTOLS.<BR>an album that poignantly depicts a social consciousness. the anger expressed in it will be like no other album ever heard. it effectively becomes the big bang of british punk rock. thus leading the way for others to come up behind like the buzzcocks, jam and damned. the entire aesthetic behind punk is that it has a very do it yourself attitude. anyone, can play this music. it doesnt exclude, it doesnt forbid. the chords are formatted in a fairly repetitious manner that can be easily played along to by one and all. <BR>\\"never mind...\\" has stood the test of time. weathered all sorts of musical trends and still it has the same power and luster as it did when it was released in 1977. <BR>there arent too many listens of an album that can become more climactic than the previous.<BR>i dont think the sex pistols thought much of the rock hall back then (just inducted). in fact, i would venture to say that they would have abhored the idea. rock for the most part had submitted to the tightening reigns of corporate rock labels.its purpose and will benign. along came the sex pistols to revive it and breath life back into it and send it another direction.<BR>one band one album, it doesnt sound like much of a legacy considering bands like the ramones and clash at least had some time to become masters of their craft. pistols achieved that same level of acceptance in the year and half or so of their existence. <BR> <BR>GOD SAVE THE PISTOLS! (more accurately.)<br />oh yeah, go out and buy it!

B00006690G|5.0|i never really liked Eminem at first, but i really had no idea as to why he was writing this stuff. EVERY song on this album explains how some event in his life has affected him. He bluntly states that it is hard to cope with things (lawsuits, kim, hailey,etc.) but explains how strong he is for getting by. He also states he doesn't care what others think about what he says or does.   i don't know Marshall at all, and i can't say i can relate to him, either. BUT i did take the time to purchase this album and just check out his lyrics. What i don't understand is why his music is considered so controversial. I don't think it is Eminem that has the problem, i think it is the listeners who can't take a few four- letter words here and there, describing an event in a young man's life,(to which they don't agree with).      I DON'T SEE HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY TOP THIS ONE!   I recommend purchasing this album for entertainment purposes only, not to try and go out and imitate/ re-enact what his songs are about. Hey, just let him do the talking, you don't even have to agree with him to like him...
B000069HKH|4.0|Well, I'm often accused of being something of an emotionless robot, so I'll be the first to say it.  We need to get over this whole thing and stop obsessing over it.  Some buildings fell down, some people died--terrible, I know, but at this point letting it dominate the spotlight the way it still does is somewhere in the range of psychological unhealthiness.  The LAST thing that the world needs right now is an entire studio album dedicated to the memory of an event that nobody's likely to forget anyway.<br />Feeling as I do, I think you'd expect that I'd hate this album.  Problem is that I don't--not really, anyway.  I have, however, read all the negative reviews of the album, and I think I can pinpoint where the problem lies for some listeners.  Springsteen has had a long career with a lot of different wonderful songs, and this collection, rather than establishing itself as an original composition, instead simply takes the choicest cuts of that career and refits them.  These aren't old songs--they're old songs with new words.  Now, if you like the old songs, I don't understand what the problem is.  &quot;Waiting On A Sunny Day&quot; sounds like a lot of Springsteen songs (&quot;Hungry Heart&quot; comes to mind).  You can either criticise it for its hackneyed nature or accept it for the same reasons you accepted the others.  I choose the latter path.<br />In that sense, this isn't really a bad album, particularly for people who weren't alive to hear all the original Springsteen music.  For those listeners, this CD will actually sound somewhat new.  Even for people who have been with Bruce for the past twenty five years, the only real problem that you might be able to find with this disk is that it's not new enough to fit your probably overblown expectations of a man who's pretty well established his limitations in the course of his career.  If you have such expectations, you may want to avoid The Rising altogether--you'll probably be disappointed.<br />As for the subject matter--I feel compelled to point out that one of the critical songs to this album actually predates the whole September mess.  It was originally written about New Jersey (which would make a certain amount of sense), Ashbury Park, etc.  While a few of these songs seem to be directed toward this already tired subject, the majority of them have NO INTRINSIC RELATION to September 11 whatsoever.  What they DO share is a generally morose tone with a somewhat hopeful twist--the theme which ties the album together.  While I won't sit here and defend the breadth of subject in this album, you should realize that there's more here than just seventy odd minutes of tribute.<br />Final verdict:  this is Springsteen.  It is the definition of Springsteen, since it's basically a rehash of some of the different high and low points of his career with a modern retooling.  If you like Bruce, as I do, without holding him to any expectation, you'll like it.  If you fail either of those conditions, chances are that this CD is a waste of money.
B000002JNN|5.0|Listening to this record is so refreshing compared to the...nu-metal that is popular now. This is a great album because there are no bad songs. If you already have BIB and you like Brian Johnson pick this record up, You wont be dissapointed!
B00005JL78|4.0|This movie is one of Spielberg's great movies and it always has that Spielbergian way with a father and a son. The plot is that Tom Anderson (Tom Cruise) is committed for a crime he &quot;will&quot; committ in the future. So he starts running to find out who framed him and escape from the Precrime force. It sounds kinda repeated but the future side makes it great. The plot has more twists than 1,000 knots which makes it really cool. I haven't tried the DVD yet but I only count it for story but sometimes the DVD matters. But one big problem is the story is very, very dark in the way things happen inside this world. My grade: B+, Great plot, idea, action, and intellengent dialouge but way, way too dark.
B000060MY6|5.0|This vision of Holywood by David Lynch is a real gem. We never know when we are in reality or in a film or even in some virtual world. Everything gets mixed up and memory is the basic stake of such a life. One loses his or her memory and lives in a world that is kind of a constant adventure where size, time and space become relative and changing. The surroundings of the characters are never very clearly divided between real houses and streets or cinema settings and sound stages. We are constantly moving from inside a film to the outside world that is so far away from the real world that it is no longer real at all. Some elements from this real world become prompters of the imaginary and phantomlike world of the silver screen. We have entirely penetrated this silver screen and we are absolutely living in it. This shows something important about modern life. Modern virtual communication has become such an essential part of our life that it has taken over our minds and our consciousness. We are no longer able to discrimate between this world and that world, this our real world and that our mental world. This leads to the impossibility to build up any kind of system of values : good and bad don't mean anything anymore and we enjoy the adventure of moving from one place to another, from one crime to another, from one experience to another without having to consider if any of them is either real or ethical. In other words this virtual world of our imagination has invaded our real world so much that we seem to be floating in some kind of drugged environment, in some kind of haunted vision where any one can become any one else and where any one can assume any role at all at any moment and time. Just clap your hands and eveyrthing is different, and a monster may appear behind a wall, and a clown on a stage may become the key to another level of virtual reality. What is reality going to be in the next stage of this development ? No one knows but David Lynch tries to warn us about a complete change in consciousness that menaces our sanity. We may all become insane due to this constant shift of references in our mental environment. And this insanity will become our new reality.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignanbout a complete change in consciousness that menaces our sanity.

0385508417|5.0|I thought it was wonderful! It is a nice fast reading story with a wonderful ending.  How many of us have thought the same thing, to skip Christmas. It put a funny side to the whole thought. And when you come to the last page, you can't help but have a smile on your face. I would love to read more stories like this one. It is wonderful for young people to read and see a light and funny side to adults.  You too will be glad that you did!!
B00006FDCD|3.0|The first 90 mins. of this miniseries is really good, and builds up a lot of promise for things to come. But, as we see all too often, delivery is far more difficult than promise. The final confrontation had better been left out if this was the best execution they could come up with; a distinct \\"C\\"-movie feeling is what you are left with at the end. And maybe that's exactly what this series is. Nevertheless I found Pennywise to be one of the scariest characters on TV and some scenes (especially in the first two thirds) are very well done - they would get 5 stars in this genre.
B00005JL78|4.0|Tom Cruise stars in this sci-fi thriller as the captain of a Pre-crime unit where precogs, beings who can see future murders, warn the unit as to what is about to happen, so they can prevent the murder from occurring.  His private life is full of angst because of the disappearance of his young son and the subsequent divorce by his wife.  Matters become more complicated when Cruise's character appears in the precog's thoughts of a future murder which he will commit.  His own unit turns against him and tries to capture him.  Using some clever tricks Cruise eludes them, and discovers that he is being set up, but he doesn't know who is targeting him.  The movie is set in 2054 and so it contains a lot of clever technology and special effects.  It moves at a fast pace and is just what the sci-fi fan ordered.
B00006SFLV|5.0|MySoCalledLife was short lived but still one of the better shows on television.  Claire Danes did a fine job acting as the young Angela Chase, an ever-changing teenager trying to discover herself and figure out her so-called life.  Many of the topics discussed in MSCL were real to life.  The show was realistic, unlike some where the endings are always perfect and happy.  The creators did an excellent job re-creating high school.  There's a reason why Claire Danes won an emmy for best actress in a drama! This show was amazing.  It is only a brief series, lasting only nineteen episodes, and it is about time that the entire series was released on DVD.  It really is great reliving MSCL!!  What a shame that it didnt last longer because you will yearn for more Angela and her friends.<BR>I dont usually write reviews, yet it seemed almost necessary for me to write one for this because I havent met a person to this day who doesnt like the show and it would be great if more people get to enjoy it.
B00000I8NC|5.0|Even though the songs and the cd as a whole are relatively short compared to other vast epics on other GYBE discs, the songs are still epic, maybe even more. Both songs ceate an entire spectrum of emotions, mostly depression and sadness but also anxiety, hope, even fear. If you're already familiar with this band you'd know the songs swim through steady and then calm waters, always building up to the next point with cresendos and climaxes. Instrumentation includes cellos, violins, violas, guitars, bass, and percussion. It might be generally described as a collision of rock and classical music.<br />The first song, &quot;Moya&quot; doesn't have any samples or talking in the background. Nice to get away from it once in a while. This song seems more joyful than the next one, I get images of my head of someone running very fast but sometimes in slow motion or through some obstacles and being very excited to wherever he's going. The general theme of the song stays the same through all 10 minutes of it, but has sort of a hidden intricacy and transformation.<br />In the second song, &quot;BBf3&quot; there are a lot of subtle vocal parts twisting around with the incredible musical climaxes. You might think this guy talking about his hatred towards the American Government and paying his speeding ticket might get old after a few listens, but it never does. It is always very interesting to listen to it with the soft music overlapping at the moment and you might find new things he didn't seem to say last time you listened to it. You might even be able to &quot;choose&quot; what to focus on-- the talking or the music. The progression and cresendos and overall atmosphere of this song is mind blowing. There are two main climatic points after sections of talking which make the quieter parts better after you listen to them.<br />If you're looking for something different to get into that you won't regret...this is it.
B000062YAZ|5.0|What more can I say about this album that hasn't been said before? It's simply a conrnerstone in metal music, a sonic abomination that came out in 1986 and destroyed everything else in the market. Of course it's been surpassed in terms of raw aggression and speed, but it remains a mandatory reference for fans of extreme music. This is the album, and the band, that influenced the ensuing death metal scene more than any other. All the elements are present in this album: tight, angry riffs that jump at you and engulf you, fast and furious drumming, short, power-packed songs that hardly give you any breathing space at all, and Tom Araya's vocals, spitting out lyrics that could make your local nuns have a collective heart attack.<br />In short, if you like metal, get this album ...
0679735909|4.0|Possession is an amazing novel, written like a historical text, but still a very enjoyable read.  The story concerns Roland and Maud, two scholars.  Roland discovers a letter written by the fictional poet he studies, Randolph Ash, that threatens to turn the public's perception of Ash upside down.  It is a love letter from Ash to Christabel LaMotte, the poetess (also fictional) studied by Maud.  Ash was supposedly happily married and Christabel supposedly lesbian.  The novel follows Roland and Maud's search to find out more about the romance between Ash and LaMotte.  Thrown into the mix are other Ash and LaMotte scholars hoping to discover the truth for themselves.  <BR>   Possession is a very interesting read, even though it is difficult.  The author, A.S. Byatt, drops many literary allusions into the text that I did not understand.  Someone with a knowledge of English poetry would take more from the novel than I did.  Adding to the novel's authenticity are poems supposedly written by Ash and LaMotte that introduce each chapter.<BR>   Possession is a difficult read.  It is a long book that takes a significant amount of time.  Many passages will need to be reread for a complete understanding.  However, it is ultimately rewarding and you will have a sense of accomplishment once you finish it.  Recommended, for those who have the time to fully appreciate it.
0066214122|1.0|Crichton's downhill slide as a writer, it could be argued, dates from the sequel to Jurassic Park. That dreadful book was obviously intended as a basis for a screenplay. Since then, Crichton seems to have been going through the motions. In &quot;Prey&quot; we're given unformed characters, an absurd plot, and -- most disappointing of all for a Crichton fan -- boring science. Is the writer getting old, or does he care only about the money? My impression is neither: He just seems bored. And so will you be, if you read this book.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|It's about time the truth about monsters is revealed. Now children young and old can sleep at night. This is the best, most endearing movie I have seen in years. I bought it so I can watch it with all my children, grandchildren, nieces nephews and friends. I laugh and cry. I cheer and cringe. The great thing about the movie is the way they have captured the voice of Boo.<BR>I have watched many a child become transformed by her confidence and childlike belief in good. They start out being afraid of the monsters and end up cheering for them. Thank you for this video.

B000000H3W|5.0|In my opinion, this is Sepultura's best album. Not to say that they didn't record good music after this one (far from it), but to me, this is the epitome of their classic style, before they ventured into a more risky, and in many ways more creative format of albums like Roots.<br />As I said, this album represents the old Sepultura, and it builds upon what they did in Beneath the Remains, for instance. The songs are fast and furious, and they follow an easily discernible thrash format with lots of technical profiency. The production quality is one of the best I've ever encountered in a metal album, with tight and mighty, yet surprisingly clear distorted guitar sounds, bright leads, and a superbly miked drumset. Listen to the double bass at the end of Desperate Cry with the volume knob cranked way up, and I swear you'll feel like there's an earthquake going on and your house is gonna crumble.<br />In my mind, Sepultura was one of the most important bands of metal in the late eighties and early nineties, and this particular work is a must for fans of this type of music. You won't regret getting this CD. It's worth your money and your time.

0316666343|3.0|The author of this novel chose a rather difficult subject. Or rather a difficult way of telling a story. The story is actually told by a dead person. Not just any person but a young girl murdered by a neighbour. A man living alone who as it eventually turns out has killed before.<br />Now, since the story is about someone who is already dead the author may well have chosen to tell us about her afterlife. Instead, we are told more about what happens after her life rather than about her own afterlife.<br />This is really a story about a family. The family to which this young girl belonged when she was alive and to which she still seems to feel she belongs after her death. It is the story of the remaining members of this family with a different emphasis put on each one of them at various stages of the story. There are also certain parts devoted to other people who were also a part of the young girl's life before her death or rather who could have become a greater part of her life had she remained alive.<br />So as it turns out this is not really a story about death as such. Nor does it pretend to be so. Really what the author is presenting as with is a story with a different point of view. <br />The point of view of the one who is no longer with us. And who can no longer be with us. <br />It seems the story would be interesting in spite of the absence of this different point of view. The reactions of the people in the murder victim's life still maintain our attention of their own accord.<br />So why have the dead person's point of view?<br />I suppose it is an element of the novel which makes the novel stand apart from other novels where a similar subject is dealt with. Yet I wonder to what extent this element has actually been used as a device so as to capture as far as possible the imagination of the reader prior to and without as yet even delving further into the details of the story.<br />Of course there is only one way to find out and that is to actually read thenovel. The novel is an easy read as such and one that can take you away from your daily reality since the story is told rather well.<br />One calming effect induced by this novel is the knowledge that no harm can befall the person telling the story since she is already dead. Even though reading the novel can also create emotions of care for those left behind and their fate. Emotions that tend to mirror the worries of the book's heroine who although dead still cares for the people who mattered to her when she was alive.<br />One quality not to expect however from this novel is answers to any questions one may have over the afterlife. This does not seem to be the aim of the novel. The link of the story to the death of the storyteller seems really to be aimed solely at the presentation of the story rather than anything else.<br />In relation to the actual way the novel ends there is an episode contained in the final part of the novel which briefly intertwines the two worlds of death and life together. To refer to this episode in detail would risk ruining the new reader's pleasure in reading the novel. However, this episode does seem to form a rather peculiar and inapt development in the whole plot of the novel creating a new set of expectations for the reader at a point where such expectations quite simply cannot be met.
B000051S44|4.0|I love racing, and everything that deals with racing. I bought this movie and for what I paid, I am content to an high level. McQueen, I think, uses too much drama to try and create rivalry between drivers and establish a good plot (I will never agree that he ever achieves a true plot in the movie, or at least a good one). It's worth buying if you like to see true racing cars, including Porsche and Ferrari, battle it out until the very end. Surprising ending. I heard, before I saw the movie that I wouldn't expect it, and I can tell you I didn't! Buy it today.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I loved Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers! It rocked! It had great places, more danger, and more action! You also got to get to know the characters a lot better to. I really enjoyed it a lot, it was spectacular! So if you liked the first one, I recommend the second one, because you will absoultly love it!
B000003C4M|4.0|Oh Man!  This is the benchmark for BAD production!  Another reviewer mentions that the band treated this as a demo recording and didn't know it would be released.  Did they think the recording sessions for the next two albums were demos too, because the mixes are laughable!  Still, this is a fun album, and really the first of it's kind for Black Metal.  You just can't listen to some of these tracks (1,000 Days, Red Light Fever, Angel Dust, Bursting Out) and not get a big grin on your face!  For that I grant 4 stars, despite the production value.  Good times, good times!
0385335482|2.0|This book tries very hard to copy the style of Bridget Jones' Diary, but it lacks the fast plot tempo, engaging secondary characters, and interesting subplots of Bridget Jones.  It follows the twenty-something singelton Rebecca Bloomwood as she shops her way into debt in London.  The first 250 pages of the paperback edition were nothing but repetitious scenes of her spending and debt problems.  Ok, we get it, how much more do we need?  Becky is also not a character you can relate to--she is lazy and incompetent at her job, and her major character transformation occurs toward the end of the book, in less than a dozen pages, and very unconvincingly.  Like Bridget, she just happens to find herself a job in tv (the Cinderella ending for our media obsessed culture), and she just happens to find a multimillionaire boyfriend to go with it, although how she can manage to attract someone like this is a mystery, as is the boyfriend himself, whose character development gets lost in the pages devoted to Becky's shopping.<BR>Other, more minor dissatisfactions I had:  the constant overuse of brand names for London products, shops,tv game shows, and restaurants that, even with context clues, don't mean all that much to an American reader.  Clearly, we're supposed to peg a shopper's socioeconomic class with them, but it's almost like reading an in joke when you're a member of the out crowd--it doesn't compute.  Kinsella also manages to use the revoltingly ugly verb \\"gabble\\", that first made its appearance for me in Bridget Jones, not once, but several times.  I think that's taking imitation too far.<BR>In short, I'd borrow this book from the library if you want a mildly entertaining read for those days when you don't want to tax a single neuron, but I'd never pay money for it.  Get Bridget Jones'Diary instead, if you want a funnier and snappier rendition of English single life.
B00005JKZT|5.0|lotr the two towers is just plain excellent,this new installment definetly  belong to the very small group of sequels that actually tops the first one (examples of this are: empire strikes back, terminator 2, the godfather 2 etc...).to some people this movie is a little disapoiting but people you have to remember that like all seconds part in a trilogy is always the second the most difficult to make because:  it still have the same problems, brings new ones and it doesn't give a resolution to the story  but this movie past the test really well giving us 3 hours of pure entretainment and setting the ground for the most wanted conclusion, so my advice is, go and see it hell i'm on my way to see it for the third time.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Hedwig is simply astounding.  Considering how few transvestite glam rock movies that you're able to get ahold of, this possibly surpasses Rocky Horror.  Wait, no, it does.  And that's saying a lot considering the context of Rocky Horror.  This movie has so many ... things to keep you interested.  True, this movie is all over the place, and it leaves a few things to the viewers imagination, but what is a movie without any of that?  I mean, honestly, I'm surprised there have been any bad reviews.  Complaining that the animation is bad?  Feh, that's the point.  It's to show meaning.  Spirit.  It's beautiful, this movie/musical.  There's a plot, many messages that are ambiguous to the person watching, a wonderful soundtrack, and so many things to interest someone.  <br />Hedwig must find his other half, but in doing so must leave behind more than he bargained for.  To be free.  I, personally, can relate to a lot of the ironies in this movie.  See it.  Now.
0790743507|5.0|Singin' In the Rain is a wonderful film with magical dance sequences choreographed by the wonderful Gene Kelly. I've been watching this film since I was a child, when I accidentally grabbed this movie instead of another MGM film All Dogs Go To Heaven (the print on the video confused me.) I instantly fell in love with this movie. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Conner ooze charm and talent all over the screen and you can't help but fall in love with every character. There is a reason why this movie is classic. Bring it into your home and share it with the family, don't let another day go by without letting them know about this magical movie watching experience.
6305161879|5.0|I am one of those who HATED the whole late night British invasion of late 70s TV, led by Benny Hill and of course Monty Python's Flying Circus. It was inane and droll. Even after a nearly a century, Charlie Chaplin is still cutting edge as far as British humor goes. That's what makes this movie such a delightful surprise. Just like in ARTHUR, British humor is fully realized when Americanized--just like Black humor is best when written by Jews--- and this, combined with John Cleeves's finsest hour, makes this a comedic classic that can go yuk for yuk with any flick!
0786867973|3.0|I love Nigella's writing in this book, and the pictures are mouthwatering.  I love reading cookbooks in general, and hers in particular.  It makes me want to try every recipe.  However when I did try her recipes, they were less than successful.  I've tried 7 dessert recipes (and I'm not a novice baker) and only one was successful (almond danish), although it took forever to make.  I also made:  almond cake (ok), Boston cream pie (cream was runny, cake had &quot;no flavor&quot; according to husband), chocolate loaf cake (completely unbaked in center), chocolate cherry cupcakes (just not sweet enough for me), Granny Boyd's cookies (awful, not chocolatey at all, and a strange dry consistency), PB squares (I think the chocolate overpowered the peanut butter, and they were hard to get out of the pan).  <br />I am so disappointed by this book.
6304595247|5.0|I first saw this on cable one night when I couldn't sleep.  I was immeadiatly drawn in by the character of Heathcliff played by Fiennes. He was haunting with his dark, dramatic performance. I had remembered watching the old black and white with I think a yong Orson Wells, and frankly I never really understood his character until brought to life by Fiennes. This movie is powerful and mesmerizing a must see for all you time period movie fans.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|As a lifelong admirer of Jane Austen's novels, and one who also greatly enjoys the Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice, I was looking forward to seeing this video. However Amanda Root's interpretation of Anne is so at odds with my reading of her that it spoiled the film for me. While her depressed and downtrodden demeanor may have been at least somewhat appropriate in the beginning, there was no sign of the remarkably improved features and color that Austen described during the Musgrove party's sojourn at Lyme, and there was nothing in Anne's looks, complexion or expression that would have caused the Walter Elliot character to look at her twice, as the novel demanded. The sprightly personality and sense of humor which is an integral part of the character that Austen created was missing entirely. The director also took too many liberties with Jane Austen's story, having the characters behave in a manner which seems foreign both to the times and to their personalities. I am particularly thinking of the way in which Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne during the gathering in her father's salon. After seeing this movie I intend to check out the 1971 version, which several reviewers have felt was far more faithful to Jane Austen's. And after all, that's why most of us want to view it.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Disney/Pixar does it again! They have made yet another good family film. With plenty of loveable characters and a good story to back it up, it deserves a place in your movie collection. You're entire family will enjoy this film. Cartoons aren't only for children anymore.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I wish that the computer geeks would stop reviewing this album and beefing about which channel which instrument comes out of. YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT!!! Hey listen, I'm here to tell you that ELVIS music will always sound best on vinyl and I've got 36 albums and dozens of 45s to prove my point. I miss the fun house echo in Heartbreak Hotel and Milkcow Blues Boogie and others songs that've been \\"Updated.\\" I hate when they don't play the back and forth fade of Suspicious Minds. That was what was so awesome about it on the record and later in his stage shows. When these staples are edited, it's like an instrument is missing. If you really want to hear EP like never before, get the records. Go buy a quadraphonic recording of the ALOHA CONCERT and feel it vibrate in your soul. The point of this album is that here he is 25 years after death dominating the charts around the world like no other. While the giants of music boast topping the 100 Million sales mark, EP is at 1.3 Billion and rising and this is the music that took him there as fresh and contemporary now as it was the day ot was released . ELV1S is the #1 selling album in the world today--not the Backstreet Boys or U2 or even Madonna. This is the 150th plus Gold album of his career and there are dozens of his albums that have sold into the millions that the RIAA have yet to certify as gold. So stop droning on about conversions and menus and listen to the music of a generation---past and present, ours and theirs.
B000002MP2|5.0|This record is a 90's classic. Fresh pop-punk with great lyrics and catchy hooks; this is the album every pop-punk band today got their influence from; and many of them are trying to make this record over again; but it just can't be done.From the honest lyrics to the incredibly catchy guitar hooks(noteably on 'When I Come Around' and 'Longview' which sarts off with; what is in my opinion, one of the best bass riffs ever written). <BR>Most people in the punk rock community called the band sell-outs when this record was released; but i think that it is just ignorance. It is not what label is on the record; it is the music that is on the record. Not buying something just because of who distributes it is like buying cereal just because the box it came in looks fancy. People should take the album for what it is; a great pop-punk record; no a great rock record, and a classic.
B0000057C5|5.0|This was a great album. Plain and simple, the best offering of an outstanding band. Much better than Herzeleid, in my opinion, and more heavy and at the same time more rythmic than Mutter. A strong knowledge of the German language helps. (By the way, DU HAST=You Have. DU HAT or DU HASST=You hate.) Nice Lyrics, although at times mildly disturbing. Definetly worth buying.
B00005YW4H|5.0|As all the reviewers have already pointed out, all the songs here are beautifully performed. After reading the editorial review, I must add that I like many of the new songs in this collection. For example, the title song by Norah herself, \\"Come away with me\\" is light hearted but it is nonetheless warm and extremely romantic. I feel that this is really a song that comes straight out of her heart and is sung with all her heart and soul. What is so great about her is the creation of a new voice, one which is blended with all the good influence from Jazz, Blues, Pops and Cuntry.  Do we really want another Billy Holiday or are we really yawning for a new voice?  Some criticizes this CD as  non-Jazz, which seems completely missing the point.  This is a great CD precisely because it is not just Jazz.  I love all the songs in this CD and I hope everyone can buy one.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne in one word is simply Good. Shes not Brittney Spears or X-tina she's just Avril and thats all that counts her music is very different. It has something people have been lacking and thats music and the truth. She writes her own songs and she plays a instrument.If you like any music then Im pretty sure you'll like this CD. Why unless you've never been hurt then this CD has something for everyone to relate to and thats just feelings. My personal fav's are &quot;Losing Grip&quot; &amp; &quot;Unwanted&quot;. By now you've heard the singles. but This album isnt as bad as people make it. And to Avril Simply thanks because this album is just what 2003 should be honest in itself.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I am 14 and do not usually listen to the music my parents listen to but this soundtrack takes popular songs and adds that new edge that makes it appealing to my friends and I.  I believe that the movie Moulin Rouge would not have been half as good as it was if the music had been altered.  If you want to listen to something new and old at the same time I recommend this CD.
0446677450|5.0|I can certainly [understand the negative opinions] of this book. This is exactly the reason why only 5% of the population succeed. Only the top 5% have the right mental mindset for success. Only the top 5% are willing to take control of their financial future. Only the top 5% are willing to &quot;stick out&quot; as Malcolm Forbes use to say.The other 95%? They are too content being downsized in those &quot;safe&quot; jobs and waiting for five years for a pay raise with their &quot;education&quot;The sorry fact is, most people need and want what Kiyosaki offers but have been blinded by formal education&quot;, &quot;tradition&quot; and other hokey dogma that obviously doesn't work.  I have made more MONEY AND GOTTEN BETTER  results in the last five months following Kiyosaki's advice than I did over the last 10 years using conventional advice.I'm a believer! Try it--it really works!!best writer. So what? The way I see it, if a guy with bad grammar can make it, what can a college educated grad fortified with Kiwosaki's philosophy do? Hey that is exciting!Seriously, this is a great book, and if you are teachable and open minded, will positively impact your life and that of your family as well.THE ALTERNATIVE? Have to depend on social security or is that Social InSecurity and live on half your income or keep working--ENT! Not my style.Thank you RTK for sharing. I also highly recommend Rich Dad's Guide to Investing Cash Flow Quadrant and The Millionaire Next Door.All are great books.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Peter Jackson and his associates continue the Lord of the Rings saga with intelligence, inspiration and brilliance.  They have created another wonderfully realized film with a seamless blend of location filming, elaborate sets, makeup & costumes, and CGI magic.  The film hits-the-deck-running, picking up where the first film stopped, with hardly a breath of backstory.  It is beautifully filmed with gorgeous cinematography and continued imagination & thought.<br />We can again be thankful for the boldness & courage of Jackson and his financial backers to film the entire trilogy at once and the same time.  The dividends of this in terms of the films sharing a unified vision and overall presentation, with a complete ensemble of players, without missing or aging cast members, and with the new locations & characters folding into the whole smoothly and naturally, is readily evident in this second film.  Likewise, while presenting awsome vistas and congregations of armies and elaborate and stunning battles, Jackson has not lost sight of the importance of the smaller more intimate scenes and relationships between Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli, Merry & Pippin, and most importantly Sam and Frodo.  We are well on the way to a masterpiece here.<br />We have new creatures ranging from flying dragons, to Orks mounted on viscious hyena-like critters.  We have a new beauty in Eowyn, Shieldmaiden of Rohan, and we have Treebeard and his bretheren.  And last, but far from least, we have the astonishing creature Gollum/Smeagol, which is not only stunning technology, but even the more so because of the pathos and complexity of his character.<br />That Jackson makes the larger story comprehensible and delineates the various strands without losing the viewer is accomplishment enough.  But there is so much more to be had in this rich and complex film.  We can be grateful that cast and crew dedicated themselves so thoroughly to the project.<br />You can't please everybody, obviously, but I foundthe first and now this film immensely rewarding experiences.  And, for the record, I have NOT read the books, and I did NOT know the story beforehand.  In fact, I'm not a great fan of fantasy, but I am a great fan of brilliant movie-making, which for my money this is!
B000006OS2|1.0|DO NOT waste your money on the DVD of this great movie. Absolutely the worst quality I have ever seen in a DVD transfer. Wait for the wide screen version that, hopefully, will appear soon. The one star is for the quality of the DVD.  The movie itself is a solid 5.
0792833201|5.0|DVD is nothing to think about. There are only the feature choice of formats and trailer. Nothing else. So if you want to buy this DVD for the features- don't- however if you want the DVD to add to your collection it is a good one. I was still scared when I viewed it and my hubby was too.<br />Picture is nice and clear. The DVD itself doesn't have fancy pitures just a DVD that says the title. Like I said doesn't have much to show.<br />I gave it 5 stars for a good plot, excellent effects, and wonderful actors &amp; actresses. Not for the DVD itself.<br />However I am disappointed that this is the ONLY one on DVD. The rest are on VHS. So you might want to save your money and buy the video. Up to you.
B00000DCHI|5.0|If you ever liked Billy Joel at all, this greatest hits package is an essential to your collection!  The only down side is that the enhanced CD has only two music videos and a discography; nothing to get excited about when much more was possible in that venue.  I would recommend buying volume 3 as a CD and also the DVD version. The DVD has extensive commentary/interviews by Joel before each track as well as the music video for every song on the collection and it is fantastic if you have surround sound!
B000002J1U|5.0|Book-ended by the powerful Led Zeppelin II and the classic Led Zeppelin IV, Zep's third album is traditionally overlooked by casual listeners.  While III certainly doesn't have the immediate or lasting impact of its preceding or following releases, there is still a lot of great material to be found on the 45 minute transitional album.  Always renowned as the originators of heavy metal, Led Zeppelin were traditionally a hard rock, blues based band that specialized in solid rhythms and bone crunching riffs.  III however, showcased a different side of the band, discarding the commercially accessible hard rock persona in favor of the group's lesser noted low key, acoustic blues side that fans had always known was there, but most critics had been skeptical of.  Displaying a drastic change in Zeppelin's sound in comparison to the uniformly fuzzed out monolithic II, Led Zeppelin III has songs ranging from traditional acoustic blues to tight pants metal.  The frequent acoustic numbers and melodic overtones give III a much more textured and mood oriented feel than the band's earlier work and while the heavy songs still have an edge to them, they are scaled back significantly from the band's previous \\"loud\\" repertoire.  However, although it's overall much quieter, Zeppelin III by no means lacks the band's trademark spirited energy.  Instead of channeling the band's impressive energies directly into creating volume though, the immense passion of each song is used to generate added depth and emotion that's both complex and simple, lending itself well to the melancholy, reflective album.  Whether the laid back more lo-fi sound of III is an evolution or a step backwards for the band is up to the listener, but regardless of personal opinions, one still has to respect Led Zeppelin for trying something completely different that vastly exceeded the traditional range of most metal bands.  III is certainly not the definitive Led Zeppelin album, but it does represent a very important and normally enjoyable side of the band that failed to find a home on many other Zeppelin recordings.
0790729725|1.0|A great movie, but I almost fell over when I discovered I would have to get up in the middle of the movie and flip the disc over.  It ruins the whole experience.  What's up with that?
B0000584V3|5.0|I have heard other works from Opeth and I think this is probably their best by far. This album is a true showcase of progressive metal. With only 8 tracks and over an hour of music, Opeth make each of their songs into an artistic masterpiece, often mixing in many styles of music (jazz and folk to compliment mostly death metal). This certainly isn't radio-type music, and those with short attention spans will find it difficult to get into this album. However, I strongly recommend this for people who can take the time to appreciate good music (in other words, if you're the type of person who wouldn't mind sitting down and listening to, say, Beethoven's 5th symphony, then you might like this). This is not to say that this music is anything like Beethoven's 5th, yet it takes an intelligent understanding of music as Opeth use lots of complex melodies and chord progressions. I think the best way to describe the songs on this CD are a fusion of Dream Theater and Morbid Angel. In other words, diehard grindcore fans wont like this, but neither will people who can't handle death metal (screaming vocals, etc). In my opinion, the best songs are The Leper Affinity and Blackwater Park. Great moody music.
B00005JLSC|5.0|\\"You know how some guys just can't hold their arsenic?\\" BAM! Ladies and gentlemen, for my next sentence this evening, about Chicago, I'd like to quote Velma upon being sworn in for court, swearing to tell you the whole truth... \\"and then some!\\" With that said, I'm telling you that CHICAGO is a KNOCKOUT! If it sweeps the Golden Globe and/or Oscar awards, it \\"had it comin'\\" to quote the infamous Cell Block Tango. Don't believe the negative hype other reviewers may give this exceptional piece of cinematic vision. Let's see them snag a role in ANY movie that sells out consistently (in Portland, Oregon, CHICAGO has SOLD OUT every show with applause after several numbers and more applause at the end!) And then let's see these arm-chair critics act, sing, & dance... and All That Jazz and see how they rate, huh? CHICAGO ROCKS! The negative hype is just jealous that they're not in this awesome HIT! They're ill-informed that there was an actual limited release (I've seen it everyday during its first weekend--I'M HOOKED!). CHICAGO'S A BLAST! Although a few numbers were cut from the theatrical release, I've heard that \\"Class\\" will be on the DVD (I hope this rumor is true). So, okay boys, \\"how's about two partin' shots?!\\" If you like \\"all the things we hold near and dear to our hearts,\\" then this Chi's for you. Any more negative hype about this KILLER thriller-diller should take the advice of the Silver-Tongued Prince of the courtroom, who had this to say about similar \\"dumb, common criminals:\\" \\"Long as you keep 'em way off balance, how can they spot you got NO TALENT?\\" In this case, CHICAGO will Razzle Dazzle anyone who CAN spot superb talent. And for my last sentence this evening, I'd have to quote Roxie and Velma again, saying, \\"here's some advice, direct from me to you:\\" Buy CHICAGO!
B00005JKZT|2.0|Tolkien, in private letters and public interviews, acknowledged that he did not \\"write \\"the Ring Trilogy as much as he \\"discovered\\" it: by exploring Middle Earth and it's languages and peoples, Tolkien also uncovered vast interweaving mythologies, the stories in the Ring Trilogy being only a small part of the whole. Tolkien took these mythologies very seriously, treating them as factual accounts, and taking great pains to make sure chronology, character and place stood up against scrutiny. He created a world filled with danger, political and personal intrigue, and most important of all, beauty.<br />It is necesary to understand Tolkien's intentions and mode in order to understand why this movie, The Two Towers, fails so utterly. The movie is devoid of beauty: where Tolkien had characters with noble bearing and places that spoke of time and splendor, Peter Jackson (the Director of the LOTR movies) chooses instead to divide all characters and places into featureless black and white. What was noble in the book is now evil until proven good. [I can't say that works the other way, the movie tends to be a bit predictable along those lines.] What was grand in the book is now mud-caked and groveling, what was subtle and witty is now trite and overblown.<br />It is hard to figure out why the filmmaker's did what they did: eliminate most of the hard-edged and truly brilliant lines, shuffle about (or ignore) character motivations, add scenes that  are intended to clarify but only succeed in bogging down flow and pace.<br />This is not a filmmaker's movie. Peter Jackson is not a capable director in a historic mode. His Heavenly Creatures is brilliant, The Frighteners is good work. Why? Because Mr. Jackson is a capably director, in a COMIC mode. The end result of his directing is a cartoon with real actors. This is the last thing that Tolkien's work asks for, and is a sad misread and miscasting of the original material.<br />I understand the difficulty of the task that faced Peter Jackson: taking three lengthy, involved and well-known books and translating them into a marketable, brandable entity that attracts viewers across all the demographics: age, sex, race, etc. Perhaps this film does that. Great, but that is not why I go to the movies. If one good thing were to come out of this mess it would be this: that perhaps more fantasy/sci-fi movies will be made, drawn from solid, classical material, with good funding and distribution.<br />If you see the movie, I applaud you. The filmmaker's spent millions of hours in time and hundreds of millions of dollars, go ahead and treat yourself for 7 bucks. But, I implore you to read the original books: the movie that I saw today is NOT Tolkien's The Two Towers, and is but a pale, overdrawn comic strip in comparison. Do Tolkien and yourself a favor and read the books!
B000002U8G|5.0|Why? Just because of Echoes! Not really, but that song (piece?) is a huge part of the album's appeal. However, that's not to discredit the rest of the tracks. One Of These Days is thoroughly menacing, with a cool bass solo in the middle. The gentle, meandering A Pillow of Winds is one of the softest, most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Fearless, based on a G-major scale, is a triumphant piece which stands among Floyd's best. The only track that feels out of place is San Tropez (which, by itself, would be great, but its tropical feel doesn't really fit the spaciness of the rest of the tracks). And, of course, the side-long Echoes is possibly the greatest art/prog rock epic ever written, and despite its slow tempo and simplistic riffs, it never seems to get boring. This album is recommended to all fans of the genre.
B000021XS0|5.0|Let me start by saying that it took 8 months for this to become my favorite album, so this is not the type of music that you can just pop into the CD player and get in to. However, once you do discover this album, you will never look at another song the same way. First of all, Dream Theater are by far the most talented band on earth. This album showcases this, with shredding solos by John Petrucci on almost all the songs, piano and synth-style keyboard solos on many songs, a bass solo (a good one, too) and DT ends the album with some of the best drum riffs/fills you will EVER hear. But besides the band's obvious talents, they do much more than just jam on this album (like they have been notorious for in the past ...3 min warning...). Instead, Dream Theater have constructed a concept album. This is a rare treat because so many of today's bands (Linkin park, Korn, etc) are too focused on getting on MTV that they don't have the skill or artistic focus to actually make an ALBUM, not just a collection of songs on a CD. The concept here deals with a rather complicated plot (I suggest using the lyrics as you listen to this CD) where a man discovers that he had lived another life before his, the life of a woman who had been murdered at a young age. Every song deals with this concept, such as on Beyond this Life, which describes the murder scene, Home, which describes the killer's jealousy, and Through Her Eyes, where the main character is struck with the grief of the murder of his former self. These different scenes ultimately lead to songs that are very diverse, well-planned, and interestingly written. Here is a description of each song<br />Regression - 3/10. This isn't much of a song, yet it starts the album off on an upbeat, optimistic note.<br />Overture 1928 - 9/10. This is an instrumental that covers a lot of ground and presents a lot of the themes heard later on in the album. This song is excellent because it sort of gives you a look at what is to come.<br />StrangeDeja Vu - 8/10. This is essentially where the story starts, and the song gives an introduction to the main character's feeling that he had lived another life. Good instrumentals, of course.<br />Through My Words - 1/10. Not a real song, it's just a 40 second transition before the next song.<br />Fatal Tragedy - 9/10. An excellent song in which the main character discovers that indeed his former self had been murdered. Over 7 minutes of excellent instrumentals and many different moods and key changes.<br />Beyond this Life - 7/10. This is probably the most \\"metal\\" of all the songs on this album, with shredding guitar riffs and a big jam session in the middle. It starts off kind of slowly, but it accelerates quite quickly into a 11+ minute monster that has some of the most memorable moments on the CD. I took off a few points for the slow start.<br />Through Her Eyes - 4/10. This is a ballad with a female guest singer and a lot of acoustic guitar and vocals. It's OK, but it gets a little too emotional, etc (the song is about the main character dealing with the grief of the death of his former life). <br />Home - 10/10. A true masterpiece that has an Eastern style melody and is extremely rich and gripping. It is 13 minutes long and has both the best guitar solo and the best synth solo. It also has excellent vocals and great riffs/melodies. <br />Dance of Eternity - 10/10. An instrumental that truly showcases the bands talent with constant guitar/keyboard soloing, a bass solo, and complex rhythm changes/patterns. Is also a great transition between HOme and the next song.<br />One Last Time - 7/10. The song begins with an excellent piano solo, then turns into a bit of a ballad, then a guitar solo, then the song becomes a redo of track 3-strange deja vu, with different lyrics and rhythms.<br />Spirit Carries On - 4/10. This is the one bad spot on this great album. The first minute is a complete Pink Floyd [soundalike](Final Cut album), and the rest of the song is too emotional and just doesn't fit DT's style. I will give it a few points though because it has a cool guitar solo.<br />Finally Free - 100/10. Yes, that is one hundred out of 10. This is the best song on the album. If you are following the story line, this provides an excellent twist to the story, and it also contains AWESOME instrumentals from start to finish. It begins innocently with acoustic guitar and vocals, then turns into a synthesized orchestral section. After a couple of verses, there's full out metal brilliance equipped with gunshots and glass breaking in the background (in this song, the murder is actually heard). Then the song becomes slow again before the most excellent finish any album has ever witnessed. A true 12 minute epic!<br />In conclusion, don't buy this album if you're the type who likes to listen to 3 minute radio singles and things like that. Only buy this if you have the intelligence and appreciation to understand good music, both for the excellent instrumental work and the story behind it.
1559408855|2.0|A loose adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom, Pier Paolo Pasolini's Sal is perhaps the most disturbing and disgusting film ever made. It is also one of the least important.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I liked Two Two Towers a lot, but the absence of Shelob and of the casting of the palantir from Orthanc was a bit of a disappointment.  These must show up in Return of the Ring, but it will be ridiculously long if they're to get everything in and do a decent job of it.  Faramir is portrayed differently in the book, and I like that way much more, as he is concerned that Gollum is to lead the hobbits past Minas Morgul, where the Nazgul reside.  Although there are flaws, I'd like to see anyone do a better job at making this movie than Peter Jackson has.  And then, you can go and try to make a better version of Dead Alive if you'd like.  The wonderful music in the trailer that is not in the movie, which many seem to be interested in, is from Darren Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream.
B000002J1B|5.0|Definitely an acquired taste, but once it is obtained, it sure is wonderful. Gates of Delirium is probably the best Yes epic they've recorded, featuring two constantly growing segments that finally build into a melancholy ending. The band experiments even more with texture and mood on this album, and the musicianship reaches beyond all of Yes' previous work. The guitar work in Soundchaser moves past most that Steve Howe had done previously, and the soothing melodies of To Be Over (largely guided by Howe's slide guitar) provide a brilliant closer to the album. Overall, I highly recommend this album to any fan of Yes' brand of progressive rock.
B000000OPW|5.0|Siouxsie and the Banshees were easily among the most creative and flexible \\"alternative\\" acts to come out of Britain in the late 70s. Despite being strapped with the rather prosaic label of being \\"Goth,\\" the band repeatedly reinvented their sound and style. After all, what other bands created such disparate sounding albums as Kaleidoscope, Juju and A Kiss in the Dreamhouse in quick succession without compromising an inch of their artistic integrity? While their career was not without its highs and lows, the spirit of the band remained solid throughout, and Tinderbox showcases what is probably the band at its tightest and most invigorated.<br />While Hyaena suffered from overproduction and unevenness, and Kiss in the Dreamhouse had a tendency to be a little too varied, Tinderbox has the band just getting down and playing. John Valentine Carruthers (side note: why were nearly all of their guitarists named John/Jon?) carries on that spidery, ethereal style typical of his predecessors, with just enough of a jagged roughness to imbue the music with that Banshees edge. Budgie's drumwork is top-notch, and the rhythm section holds a consistent, powerful base for the melodies and strains dancing within the music. And Siouxsie - her voice much improved from the occasional off-key ramblings early in the band's career - carries on throughout the songs with appropriate vivacity and/or urgency.<br />There really isn't a weak moment here. \\"Candyman\\" gets the album off to an energetic start, before moving on into the softer and more atmospheric \\"The Sweetest Chill.\\" \\"This Unrest\\" creeps in mysteriously, but then turns up the volume and rocks a lot harder (nice, harsh guitar tones in there too). \\"Party's Fall\\" is upbeat, but very tight throughout, and \\"Cities in Dust\\" stands on its own as one of the band's best known singles (deservedly so). The closer - \\"Lands End\\" - is pretty low-key by comparison, but Budgie's touch on the drums is particularly fine here, keeping the music interesting until the end. This specific release also includes the b-sides from the \\"Candyman\\" and \\"Cities in Dust\\" singles at the end, which are a nice addition as well (even if they do change the context of the album somewhat).<br />All in all, Tinderbox is a vital part of the Banshees career (along with Juju and Kaleidoscope, which are also true classics). Considering the strength of this release, it's somewhat surprising how short-lived this incarnation of the band was. . . .within little over a year of its release, the final line-up of the band was taking over the reins. In some ways this marks the last stage of an era, as Peepshow begins the departure from the headier days of the band. But, if recent rumors indeed prove true, perhaps the final chapter hasn't been written quite yet.sting until the end.

B00005OM4K|4.0|Great box set by a great band. My only beef with it, is the strange way the discs' tracks are layed out. The original albums are spread across discs (I guess to reduce the overall number of discs required for the box set) but this makes it a bit confusing. It's not always aparent what original album you are listening to. Other than that -- great stuff -- especially the pre-CCR stuff.
B000002J20|5.0|A lot of people pass this album off as &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;self-indulgent&quot;. Try &quot;inspired genius&quot;. Based on the Shastric scriptures of Hinduism, this album gives each segment a 20-minute (approximately) composition. Yes, the lyrics are weird, but how is that different from albums like Fragile or Close To The Edge? Odd lyrics are something of a Yes staple, and this album is no different. Jon Anderson still has an amazing falsetto that fits the music perfectly.<br />Musically, this album is genius, especially the first piece (Revealing Science of God) and the last (Ritual). Blending their signature prog rock with elements of eastern music, the band moves in to new territory, pushing and moving beyond the boundaries of art rock. Steve Howe's guitar work is brilliant and exciting, Wakeman's keyboards create a vast, deep soundscape, and the Squire/White rhythm section drives the band throughout. Overall, if you enjoy a challenging listen, this album will surely satisfy. Very highly recommended.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I have not seen the movie, but this soundtrack is absolutely beautiful.  If you are a Philip Glass fan it's a no-brainer.  If you're not faimilar with Glass, it won't take long to become a fan after listening to this CD.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Been there, done that.<br />When I first saw THE TWO TOWERS, I (a hopeless Tolkienite) was in shock.  What did I just see?  Eomer not at Helm's Deep, but instead riding to the rescue with Gandalf?  The reluctance of King Theoden to go to war against Isengard?  Helm's Deep as a refuge for the people of Edoras, instead of a heavily-fortified Rohan stronghold?  Aragorn going over a cliff with a warg?  Eowyn a romantic counterpart to Aragorn?  Arwen, Elrond, and Galadriel in the movie at all?  A host of elves from Lothlorien, led by Haldir, coming to the rescue of Helm's Deep?  No \\"moving forest\\" to destroy and smother fleeing orcs from the Helm's Deep battle?  The reluctance of Treebeard and the Ents to go to war?  Faramir, brother of Boromir, taking Frodo and Sam captive to use the Ring?  The men of Gondor taking the Hobbits to Osgiliath (in the book, nothing more than a ghost town), under siege by Sauron?  No showdown between Gandalf and Saruman?  No disgusting, foul-smelling tunnel of Shelob?<br />Yes, I was in shock.  How dare Peter Jackson take such liberties with this, perhaps the best, of the books in the LOTR trilogy?<br />Fortunately, I took a deep breath, then went to see this film again.  A good friend of mine reminded me that books and movies are two entirely different mediums:  what works well for one doesn't necessarily translate for the other.  And I must confess, despite all my misgivings:  this film is a complete cinematic masterpiece.  THE TWO TOWERS is a virtual feast for the eyes--breathtaking landscapes, stunning cinematography, mind-boggling CGI (Gollum/Smeagol comes across as an actual, living creature), compelling acting, and a great, great story.  It's a story that gets up and moves, from the first frame to the last; it's a story that makes its own mark, independent of the book it was based upon.<br />I realize the Tolkien purists are up in arms:  so was I, at first.  My suggestion:  see this film with an open mind, and let it entertain you on its own merits.  You will not be disappointed.n its own merits.  You will not be disappointed.
B000024D4R|5.0|This album showcases Roger Waters' songwriting at its finest. I can't describe the power of this album. You just have to hear it (absolutely have to).
B00003CXBH|5.0|Thanks Marty for the news that The Mission will be available on DVD in April.<BR>I suggest that the studio should also include the audio soundtrack seperately apart from the movie in the DVD so as to enable the user to play only the audio tracks if required.<BR>Is this a technical possibility, if it is then I think that the studio should go for it as an exceptional case and I bet movie buffs would not mind shelling out that little extra for it especially as the music of this movie is heavenly and has been nominated for the Oscar.
B000002U8G|5.0|Why? Just because of Echoes! Not really, but that song (piece?) is a huge part of the album's appeal. However, that's not to discredit the rest of the tracks. One Of These Days is thoroughly menacing, with a cool bass solo in the middle. The gentle, meandering A Pillow of Winds is one of the softest, most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Fearless, based on a G-major scale, is a triumphant piece which stands among Floyd's best. The only track that feels out of place is San Tropez (which, by itself, would be great, but its tropical feel doesn't really fit the spaciness of the rest of the tracks). And, of course, the side-long Echoes is possibly the greatest art/prog rock epic ever written, and despite its slow tempo and simplistic riffs, it never seems to get boring. This album is recommended to all fans of the genre.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Yes.  I have all the Beatles albums and many of the solo albums.  This is by far the best among all of them.   All tracks in this album are great.  <br />The 7 minutes DVD is must for all George Harrison fans.  <br />While you are at it, also buy the new edition of All Things Must Pass.  <br />Thank you George, you are my hero.
B000002J1F|4.0|Fragile is a good album. Not great, but good. It's one of those albums that you don't have to like, but you do have to &quot;appreciate&quot;. Musically, this album leaves something to be desired. The true compositions (Roundabout, Heart of the Sunrise, and South Side of the Sky) are excellent, no doubt about it. But the solo pieces are average to poor, and really serve as no more than filler (as a matter of fact, this album was rush-released to pay for Wakeman's huge number of keyboards). However, as it is the genesis of Yes' finest era, it must be &quot;appreciated&quot;. Just don't expect much beyond the first and last tracks.
B000000WJZ|5.0|It would be something of an understatement to say that this album means a lot to me.  Of all the albums that I own, few have quite the same importance attached to them in my mind.  This album was given to me as a belated gift for my fifteenth birthday just before Thanksgiving by my aunt.  I had recentely purchased Mellon Collie and was astounded.  But this album blew me away.  The melodic beauty and pure satisfaction of \\"Today,\\" the heartbreak of \\"Spaceboy\\" and \\"Disarm\\" the textured, shifting soundscapes of \\"Hummer\\" and \\"Soma\\" and the isolation and sadness of \\"Mayonaise\\" all hit home very hard.  Just following that Thanksgiving, my grandmother died of lung cancer.  It was expected, and that entire vacation was colored by her illness and eventual death as we had known it would be and meant it to be.  We had come down to Texas for Thanksgiving to say goodbye, and it was a very sad time, to which \\"Siamese Dream\\" was a soundtrack for me.  Since, the songs have taken on new meanings and I associate them with other things as well, but few other pieces of music are as evocative for me as this album.  It is without a doubt one of the best that I own and I would recommend this to any and all fans of intelligent, beautiful rock music.  The album has so many transcendent moments: the intro to \\"Cherub Rock,\\" the abrupt dynamic shift at the beginning of \\"Today,\\" the rambling, hushed clean tone solo at the end of \\"Hummer\\" (enhanced, brilliantly, with a digital delay), the violin in \\"Disarm,\\" the distorted rush of \\"Soma\\"'s climax, the interludes of \\"Geek U.S.A.\\" and \\"Mayonaise\\" . . . and on and on.  This album is best experienced as a complete piece of music, but all the songs are standouts.  I cannot recommend it enough.
B00005B36H|5.0|Come on. How can you pass this album off as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;useless&quot;? I find that this is one of the most challenging albums released in years. It draws inspiration from prog rock like King Crimson and Pink Floyd as well as metal like Metallica, and instead of taking them both, they only pick out the good stuff- the speed and sound of metal and the artiness and precision of progressive rock, without the corniness of metal or the pretentiousness of prog. This band has consistently crafted moving and creative music, towering far above the average 90s band.<br />This album in particular may not be as heavy or fluent as earlier Tool albums. In my opinion, though, during those moments when the band hits their stride, they absolutely rock beyond any other metal band. Songs like Schism and The Grudge are brilliant fusions of prog rock timing and musical prowess with the thunder of metal, and the last few songs on the album flow wonderfully. This album is a ray of hope in an otherwise bleak music scene, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.<br />(By the way, I am not a &quot;raving Tool lunatic&quot;. I'm just a casual listener.)
B000002KE2|5.0|this cd is very good i enjoy most of ozzy's songs but my favorite on this cd is changes a well based piano song it is great and it tells that ozzy is not all hard rock 5 stars to this cd
B000002J1H|3.0|This album is ok at best, boring at worst. At this point, the band had begun to move into pop territory, abandoning the course set by Relayer and Tales from Topographic Oceans. Despite the return of Rick Wakeman, most of the music seems uninspired, especially the poppy fluff of Wondrous Stories and the cheesy country-flavor of Going for the One. Even the epic piece, Awaken, isn't up to par with Yes' earlier selections. To me, this album signifies the beginning of the end of Yes, serving as little more than a document of the transition into the 90125 era. I would only recommend this album to hardcore fans.
B00005JKZT|4.0|The Two Towers is a fitting follow up to the very successful first instalment. Again there are strong performances by almost all the cast, the cinematography, attention to detail and pace are excellent, and the creative adaptation of certain elements from the books are by in large successful. However, having now seen the extended version of the \\"Fellowship\\", I have to wonder what was left on the cutting room floor, and what might be included in a subsequent DVD release. <br />I'm not wanting to sound too rabid a fan, but I was disappointed with a few elements in the film. While the \\"Fellowship\\" perfectly captured the relationship between Sam and Frodo, the Two Towers seemed to lack the development of the relationship between Legolas and Gimli. This is primarily due to the direction of Gimli's character, which tended towards bombast and general comic relief. This direction, while making internal sense within the movie, misses the crux of Gimli's character in the book, and doesn't leave enough with the audience to explain the depth and intensity of the friendship between these two characters. The extended \\"Fellowship\\" DVD made some critical development of the Gimli character, though given the structure of the cinematic release of the \\"Two Towers\\" I am not sure how easy it may be to do the same. In addition, I am again not too sure of Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Elrond. I'm not entirely certain whether it is his presence or direction, but I can't escape the feeling that Rupert Everett might have been a better choice for the role. I am looking forward to an extended version coming out in a year - the pieces added to the Fellowship DVD filled many of the minor imperfections of the theatrical release, and hopefully the same will be said with the Two Towers. <br />That being said, all other aspects of the film were excellent. Viggo Mortensen captures his role perfectly, the opening sequence is brilliant, and Gollum is the first CGI character I have not found to be both instantly obnoxious and a waste of space. Like its predecessor, this is not a movie for those with an MTV attention span or a pride in their own functional illiteracy. For the rest of us, Two Towers is definitely worth seeing - it is engaging, visually spectacular and well acted: what more could you wish for in a movie?
0316666343|3.0|Alice Sebold is a fantastic writer. Her prose flows from chapter to chapter. But the storyline becomes a bit farfetched and strays over the final 75 pages. Somehow, I sense that this novel will turn into a Steven Spielberg movie. And that's not a compliment.
0767817478|1.0|First, this is not a Godzilla film. I don't state that because I'm some sort of traditional Toho Godzilla zealot, I say it because this film really has nothing in it that connects it in any way to the Godzilla franchise. The creature in this film is a slender, fleet-footed lizard that doesn't have atomic breath, doesn't fight a monster adversary, and doesn't try to cause destruction. It's just a dinosaur-creature. I think that these facts explain why a lot of traditional Godzilla fans were, to put it mildly, very disappointed. This film is not at all geared toward Godzilla fans, which raises the question of why it uses the name \\"Godzilla\\" at all. I mean, if the film doesn't appeal to them, and if the name is going to turn away people who don't like the traditional Godzilla movies, then what's the purpose of calling it Godzilla instead of establishing a new franchise? Well, I don't know the answer to that question, but I can suggest the following: Had the film been a success, it could have spawned a Hollywood Godzilla franchise separate from the Toho one. Traditional Godzilla fans may be glad that didn't happen, but they must recognize that Toho did it. I mean, some people love the original Godzilla but despise the goofy series of movies in the late 1960s that included, e.g., \\"Godzilla vs. Megalon\\". And with regard to adhering to Godzilla traditions, remember how Godzilla was able to fly using his atomic breath as propulsion in his battle with Hedorah the smog monster? The bottom line is that there is a Toho Godzilla film for every type of traditional Godzilla fan to hate. With that said, I think the producers of this film may be guilty of arrogance and condescension in rejecting every feature of the Toho Godzilla films, but that doesn't mean that the end product can't be a great addition to the Godzilla legacy. <br />Okay, so I said in my above title that I wanted to get a couple of things straight. The first was that this film isn't in any way related to traditional Godzilla films, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's terrible. The critical second thing to get straight is that this movie does happen to be very bad. I can only believe that the positive reviews listed with this review must have been written by people connected to the producers because I have yet to meet anyone who strongly liked it. Most, like me, think it's a maudlin story about unappealing characters with occasional special effects exercises involving a big lizard. In fact, many people found it insultingly patronizing: The exploitation of the Godzilla name, the pandering (and awkward) inclusion of the Jean Reno character once it was decided that it would debut at Cannes, the rip-off of Jurassic Park at the end, the sickly and manipulative relationships between Broderick and just about every other character (including the lizard), and most of all the deviation between the heavily promoted nature of the film and the actual film itself. It really is a very bad movie.
0060194995|5.0|While this book had a great impact in the 1960s, I didn't read it until 2002. It was on my must-read list and I'm glad I got around to it. While the novel deals with black/white issues during the 1930s, it is much more. Readers today can learn valuable lessons about honesty, integrity, and truth. It's a shame Harper Lee didn't continue to write because she had a wonderful sense of human interaction.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This is an awesome movie!! This animation of 'Tree Beard' was amazing!  I would definitely recommend this movie to ALL of my friends.  I purchased the DVD-Lord of the Rings-Fellowship of the Ring & I AM going to buy LOTR-TTT as soon as it becomes available!  I would pay to go & see it again & again & again....<BR>Aragon is a babe!!  The ending was a little upsetting until I realized that there is another movie coming out.  I hope it will be coming up pretty soon, I don't think I can wait too long to see another LOTR movie.  I am seriously thinking about going out & buying the books so I have them as well.
B00005JL3A|1.0|The most boring horror film in years.  Bad CGI FX, stupid rubber dogs and pathetic pace and plot.  NO horror, no surprises.  Don't give Anderson another chance.  He is a hopless director and this is proof final.  The most tedious zombie film EVER made.  JUNK in every way.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I have never really gotten into the whole fantasy/science fiction genre. Although I have enjoyed movies like Star Wars, I was never hooked as one of those die-hard fans. In fact, when the first LOTR movie came out I didn't see it. However, I rented it from the video store about a month before The Two Towers came out, and was amazed. I love the whole story, along with the actors that portrayed it so convincingly. I feel the same way about its sequal. In my opinion, The Two Towers is even better then the first film. I found myself enthralled in the plot, and begging for more. The 3 hour length seemed to fly by. I seriously think that the actor who played Gollum should be rewarded for a brilliant and engaging performance. I can't wait until the final installment. Actually, I just started reading the books, and have almost completed The Fellowship of the Ring. I am pleased with how closely the movie follows the book so far. Go see this movie. I have already seen it three times, and each time I hear or understand something new. It's amazing!!
B00004W221|5.0|I could care less about Notor Dame football, but I love this movie.  For this little guy to want this that badly and go threw all the ... he went threw to do it was truely epic. This is one of my Ten Best movies of all time.
B000002MUW|5.0|Released some eleven years after her 1983 self-titled debut album, Madonna's &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; stanads as the singer's transition from dance ingenue, of sorts, to a more mature artist. The collection of songs features The Material Girl as a woman totally in charge of herself as a performer and as a poet of song.<br />There are the standard jams that harken back to her earlier stage of development (&quot;Don't Stop&quot; and &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;), but even they possess a mellower and slower tempo. The tune &quot;Sanctuary&quot; gives a hint of Madonna's future persona a la &quot;Ray of Light&quot;.<br />&quot;Love Tried to Welcome Me&quot; and &quot;Take a Bow&quot;, both co-written by Babyface, exhibit a depth of purpose and maturity that the singer would build upon in her award-winning (and platinum-selling) &quot;Evita&quot;.<br />Again, &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; is an essential in the singer's lengthy discography, necessary for the fan as an example of the lady's musical growth.
0790729644|5.0|This movie is the anti Western, it looks at all the westerns before and says, no it's not like that.  If you like dramas or action movies this is a must see.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The first film sported an award-worthy performance from Ian McKellan and an impressive array of special effects and a literate script.  Installment two opts for LONGER battle scenes (surprisingly bloodless) and almost an equal distribution of on-screen time for each of the major players in this epic tale.<br />However, the combination of computer generated effects and the acting skills of Andy Serkis make \\"Gollum\\" one of the true marvels of a truly stupendous film.  The actor's vocal talents and inspired movements make this one of the most memorable \\"debuts\\" in motion picture history.<br />And John Ryes-Davis does double duty in the returning role of Gimli the dwarf AND the voice of \\"Treebeard\\", a creature that bears a striking resemblance to late director John Huston.
B000065U1N|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, but I think if it wouldn't have been a true story I would have been bored with it.  I usually enjoy true stories more.
B0000029DD|5.0|this may not be some hugely detailed review, far from it, but there's no point in me rambling on about the beauty of this album. And this isn't a review thats going to be of any great help to anyone either. Put simply, buy this album, its the greatest EVER made. Just be in awe of the genius of this greatly missed man.
B00003CX95|5.0|I didn't watch this movie for a few years after it came out because I feared it would be to Mel Gibson as &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; was to Brad Pitt.  I was wrong, this movie rocks.  I bought it on DVD the day after I saw the movie.  If you like action and drama you'll love this movie.
B00005JKZT|1.0|I thought the first one was pretty good and i was some what excited to see this one but oh man... I wish I didn't go. I basically had no idea what was going on through the whole thing and the movie is like 10 hours long without out one damn thing happening. This is basically what the movie is like.. \\"We must go to argon and get the splinter t cheese crisp to find the missing amulet of my brother.\\" Scene changes to 2 kids and a really annoying moster thing which lead no where the just walk around and argue and a bunch of other .... happens that has no point and is really boring. They finally have action at the end buts it's way too late to save the movie. DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
B00005JKBC|3.0|Ok,  I have a real dislike for Robert Redford but spy movies are my favorate,  this one was even honest, no shoot up spies like in some movies.  I've also been weerly of seeing anything with Brad Pitt since Legends of the Fall but he's building his stock back up with me.  For the most part this movie is ok,  I'd watch it again I just wish they wouldn't have put Robert Redford in it.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is an awe inspiring and visually stunning tribute, not only to Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, but to the \\"Greatest Generation.\\"  But for their sacrifices, would we share the freedoms we so cherish and covet to our vests today!  Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg deserve all of the awards and accolades they received for bringing this epic to HBO and now this incredible DVD box set!<br />Part 1 - Currahee - Currahee is a wonderful beginning to this unprecedented HBO miniseries.  Outside of the movie \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" there has never before been such a realistic series such as this one.  Currahee poignantly highlights the training that was necessary for the newly designed Airborne Infantry.  While some may think that Captain Sobel was a complete idiot, in all truth, his combat skills were obviously lacking however, as a trainer, he put Easy Company in a very good position as a well trained unit.<br />Part 2 - Day of Days - D-Day has arrived and Easy Company makes the jump that they've been preparing two years for.  As history unfolds, the German flak has caused nearly every plane to miss their designated drop zone.  1LT Winters finds he's in Normandy, lost his weapon and his company.  He finally arrives at the assembly area and is given the mission to take out a German artillery position.  Day of Days is an excellent episode that doesn't miss out on 1LT Winters depth of emotions as he loses his first soldier in combat.<br />Part 3 - Carentan - Easy Company is ordered in to take the French village of Carentan.  While encountering only minor resistance, they take light casualties.  After successfully taking the town, they're ordered to move on to the next objective.  En route, they encounter the German force sent to retake Carentan.  They stalemate for the evening, expecting to forge a full assault in the morning.  The Germans have other plans though and counter attack in the morning with a combined force of mechanized infantry and armor.  Fortunately for Easy Company, they are finally rescued by the 2nd Armored Division.  Shortly after this action they are lucky enough to get some R&R back in England.  The show ends with orders back to the front and a very poignant final scene to yet another wonderful episode.<br />Part 4 - Replacements - Replacements jumps forward to September and Easy Company is on R&R in England.  They're called into Operation Market Garden.  Easy Company is given the mission to take Eindhoven, Holland.  They were told they would be running into light resistance.  Operation Market Garden turns into a huge failure and the Allied Forces are turned back with heavy casualties.  Sgt \\"Bull\\" Randleman is quite unfortunate enough to get stuck behind enemy lines.  \\"Replacements\\" is another excellent episode.<br />Part 5 - Crossroads - Crossroads is one of the best shows of the whole miniseries.  Captain Winters, due to the costs of war, garners advancement from Easy Company Commander to Battalion Executive Officer.  The episode is shown, through the eyes of Captain Winters as he is preparing a report on the actions of October 5th when he led his company in the attack of a German SS position.  The more telling part is later in the episode when he gets an R&R in Paris and the horrors of war catch up to him.<br />Part 6 - Bastogne - To quote Captain Winters, \\"we're paratroopers; we're supposed to be surrounded.\\"  Bastogne tells the tale, from Easy Companies point of view, about the 101st Airborne Infantry being surrounded by German forces and holding the line during the Battle of the Bulge.  This is also the combat action where the Commanding General of the 101st Airborne replied to the German Commanders request for their surrender, \\"nuts.\\"<br />Part 7 - The Breaking Point - January 1945 and Easy Company is on the verge of attacking the Germans in Foy, Belgium.  Due to heavy resistance, Easy Company endures nearly a month of being barraged by German artillery on the front line.  This episode is very telling as far as the how demoralizing the artillery can be.<br />Part 8 - The Last Patrol - Easy Company is on the front line in the Alsacian town of Haguenau.  They now have the sense that the war is coming to a close, as they are just across the river from Germany.  The brigade commander orders a patrol across the border to secure German prisoners.  This episode again brings to the forefront the emotions of the soldiers as they again are counted on to accomplish their mission!<br />Part 9 - Why We Fight - This episode is clearly the most poignant of the series as Easy Company finds and liberates a concentration camp.  Although there had been rumors of these concentration camps, no once could truly comprehend what they were about until they were faced with them!  This episode alone should've garnered several awards.<br />Part 10 - Points - Easy Company takes Eagles Nest, Hitler's mountaintop fortress.  The company settles in as an occupation force, yet expecting to be redeployed to the Japanese warfront.  A very emotional what happened to several of the units members after the war.  Overall, this episode is a fantastic conclusion to the \\"Band of Brother.\\"<br />Disk Seven<br />We Stand Alone Together:  The Men of Easy Company - An outstanding documentary containing interviews with surviving members of Easy Company!  Once you've seen all of the episodes, this documentary introduces you to the real members of Easy Company.<br />Ron Livingston's Video Diaries - This is an exceptional set of clips filmed by Ron Livingston, who played Lieutenant Nixon, covering the \\"actor boot camp\\" run by Captain Dale Dye, USMC Retired.<br />HBO's The Making of Band of Brothers' - This is another excellent \\"Making of\\" clip by HBO, covering the creation of this spectacular miniseries! {ssintrepid}
B000002UAR|4.0|REVOLVER is a decent CD, but I am hard pressed to say that it is the best album the BEATLES ever recorded. There are some great songs on this album and this is album is a prequel to what we would see from the band in the future. There was some studio experimentation during the recording process, and it only helped to steer to band into that direction on latter albums. In my opinion that standout songs on REVOLVER are : TAXMAN, ELEANOR RIGBY, YELLOW SUBMARINE, GOOD DAY SUNSHINE, GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE, which of course any Beatle fan would know. Of the other songs, I think that the listener will enjoy I'M ONLY SLEEPING, SHE SAID SHE SAID, and AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING. LOVE YOU TO starts off with an Eastern feel to it that takes alittle while to get used to while TOMMORROW NEVER KNOWS is a true psycadelic tune. While some might disagree with me, I think that RUBBER SOUL or the WHITE ALBUM might just be the best ones the group ever did.
0875845851|5.0|This is one of the most insightful books on business that I have ever read. It explains a very important concept - how radically new (disruptive) technologies can dislodge existing well-established (sustaining) technologies and in the process beat market leaders at their own game. First a brief explanation of the nature of disruptive technologies and how different they are from sustaining technologies. Then comes the inability of established firms to pursue these technologies due to \\"resource dependence\\". Excellent managers fail miserably when confronted by these disruptive forces. The conventional processes of being extremely customer focussed, profit driven and rational decision making for technology selection are the soft spots that eventually lead to the demise of these firms when attacked by disruptive products.<br />Disruptive technologies initially offer products that perform slightly lower on a given parameter but are typically smaller, have lower unit costs and more convenient to use. Mainstream users initially reject these products due to lower performance. Hence disruptive products soon find small niches for themselves in totally new markets (value networks) where they are appropriate for use. Due to this adoption and growth in volumes in these segments the technology trajectory begins to move upwards intersecting and invading the territory of the conventional market from below. Incumbents ignore the threat even at this stage and before they realize their folly, they are soon filing for Chapter 11. <br />Large companies ignore small markets (markets for disruptive technologies are initially small) and look for growth in established markets (markets for disruptive technologies are not initially known at all). Executives of large companies are reluctant to take on challenges in small and unknown terrain since they are always trained to \\"think big\\". <br />The hypothesis is explained very clearly using the disk drive industry (I would like to use the term \\" high clock speed\\" industry) and extended to industries as diverse as steel, escavators, retail and pharmaceuticals.<br /> The case study on automobile industry is frightening for those serving the sustaining gasoline segment. Yesterday evening I was struggling through the chaotic New Year eve traffic at 6: 30 PM in Bangalore, India to reach home early in my 1.3 liter mid segment petrol engine car. While I was virtually trapped in the chaos, I observed a cute small battery powered car navigate effortlessly through the gaps and finally was far ahead of the crowd. What next?. I decided to revisit this book.  <br />Highly recommended for managers in all industries.
0151008116|4.0|To be honest, I was more taken in by the life of Pi prior to the shipwreck: how he was treated in school, how his Father educated him about animals and his own observations and conclusions about animals. Pi has a wonderful, child-like and optimistic manner of looking at animals. The metaphors that he drew were nothing short of brilliance. <br />As for the shipwreck episode and his 227 days onboard a lifeboat (or should I also say a raft) were a bit too detailed for me but nonetheless funnily portrayed. It is amazing how entrapped with a Bengal tiger, Pi managed to maintain his sense of innocence but good judgement about the temperaments of animals.<br />The days that Pi spent in the vast oceans tell us a lot about life: how people will fight to survive no matter how slim the chance appears; how a vegetarian, out of sheer survival need, took well to killing and eating meat; how Pi ate the excrement of the Bengal tiger (disgusting, I know, but Pi had to eat if he were to go on living); how proper planning is important is everything one does including surviving a shipwreck; how a human who supposedly should not hope to survive in the company of an equally hungry tiger, managed to improvise and carve out his territory et al.. Much of these lessons have real relevance in our daily lives. This is especially so in these grim times where the threat of terrorism, economic uncertainty and war loom. The message of having a will to survive all odds is a timely one.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed Yann Martel's writing. This guy uses an interesting way to describe the behaviour of animals and many a times, I could not help but think: isn't he describing us- the human race? Yann personifies animals and in the process, allows the reader a second look at the much seeminly-fathomless properties of animals. I esecially like the way he depicted that Man is the most dangerous animal of all. In reading this book, I learnt quite a fair bit about the parts of a lifeboat, some shipwreck survivalskills, a good amount of knowledge about animals and in the process, had a good chuckle whenever I reached the funny parts/ words that he used generously throughout the book.<br />I would give it a \\"5\\" if the author had eloborated a bit on how Pi survived after the shipwreck. Guess that that is not the main point of the story but it would make the book more complete.<br />Go on, read this book and share it with others.
B0000026UL|4.0|The awkward tussling with increasingly complex recording techniques and the case of writer's block that plagued Bob Dylan in the late eighties came to an end on Oh Mercy. On this excellent 1989 release, Dylan not only found a producer who could suit him at the dawn of the digital age but also wrote a handful of the best songs of his latter career.<br />The producer in question is Daniel Lanosis, a former Brian Eno prot&eacute;g&eacute; acclaimed for his work on albums such as Robbie Robertson's self-entitled solo debut, Peter Gabriel's commercial break-through, So and U2's masterpiece, The Joshua Tree. On Oh Mercy, Lanosis shows the uncanny ability to induce atmospheres that are both organic and encompassing. He places Mason Ruffner's bluesy guitar, Dylan's croaky vocals and twinkling piano and his own lap steel in exactly the right place at exactly the right caliber, ensuring that Oh Mercy does not lack a single second that is not sonically satisfying and does not include one that is overindulgent or overwhelming.<br />The songs in question include \\"Man in the Long Black Coat,\\" one of Dylan's darkest and best cinematic songs; \\"Political World,\\" an excellent tirade against the high stakes and limitless upheaval of the modern world; \\"Ring Them Bells,\\" a beautifully subtle song treated well with an almost hymn-like ambience; and \\"Most of the Time,\\" a song of loss that is as compellingly anguished and emotive as any on Blood on the Tracks. Although he still occasionally tumbles (\\"Disease of Conceit,\\" features the most irritating metaphor-abuse of his career), Dylan produces some of his strongest writing in years. It came through at a very opportune time. Oh Mercy is the album Dylan's fans waited the entire eighties for, the album where everything came together.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Oh my God this is the only the CD I've been listening to since I got it!! I know a lot of people are sketchy to buy this CD because of the \\"Dirrty\\" video, but none of the songs are like that. My favorite songs are: <br />\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" a song featuring Lil' Kim which is about the steroetypes of what guys are able to and girls aren't. <br />\\"Walk Away\\" a ballad that I keep on repeat all the time. One of the most powerful songs on the CD<br />\\"Fighter\\" is a song where she obviously tells about a bad relationship she had with someone who used her. With Dave Navarro on guitar, it adds something a little extra. Kinda rock feel. If I only listen to one song on the CD, it's this one.<br />\\"Infactuation\\" which is about her first love. Has a latin feel to it.<br />\\"Impossible\\" written by Alicia Keys. It sounds like something Keys would sing and it's an addictive song.<br />\\"Beautiful\\" an inspirational song that kinda speaks to you... an instant classic.<br />\\"Cruz\\" great song to chill to<br />\\"Soar\\" another one of those chill songs<br />\\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" is a song about having casual sex. Bad message, great song. It just makes you feel naughty when you sing along with it.<br />\\"Dirrty\\" we all know this one, It's catchy and you can't help singing along with it.<br />\\"The Voice Within\\" reminds me of \\"The Greatest Love Of All\\" by Whitney Houston. It's great. <br />\\"I'm OK\\" is a song that is very personal. She sings about how her father abused her mother. Very touching.<br />The whole CD is great and I demand that you go get it. This is what Christina should have been doing all along.
B000005YZM|5.0|Odessey and Oracle is sometimes called the British Pet Sounds. While I can't fully justify that title (What album is honestly another Pet Sounds?), the first and last proper album of The Zombies does present astonishingly complex musical and lyrical schemes that, like those of The Beach Boys' grand opus, push the boundaries of the pop song beyond the limitations it faced before the mid-sixties. Not that this is anything new to The Zombies, who, from 1964 to 1967, released a string of unorthodoxly constructed pop songs full of tricky time changes and twisting melodies to, unfortunately, little notice. Odessey and Oracle does, however, represent a new prime for the band.<br />Although the playful \\"Time of the Season\\" was its only hit, this 1968 album includes a wealth of excellent material. The remarkable \\"Care of Cell 44\\" is a light, airy song featuring gorgeous harmonies and stomping piano that just happens to be written to a woman in prison. The rousing \\"This Will Be Our Year\\" features an assertive performance from lead singer, Colin Blunstone that overflows with joy and excitement. Similarly stirring is \\"Friends of Mine,\\" a tribute to friendship and love, deemed one of popular music's greatest love songs by the file-sharing service/online music magazine, Audiogalaxy. The album's best track, however, is the spell-binding \\"Changes,\\" in which choir-ish harmonies that softly remember a summer queen overlap almost tribal-sounding drums for a truly dreamlike effect. I could continue the daunting task of trying to unravel these spectacular songs, but I trust I have made my point: This is one of the truly great albums of its era.
B00005JKZT|5.0|..This is by so far the best movie of the year by my opinion. Everything about it is absolutley deserving 5 stars(*****). Just like the last movie, the acting, the picture, the screen play, the special effects, the sound effects, and the music sound track IS unbeliveable. The Lord of the rings: the two towers movie wen't way beyond my expectations. It's beyond incredible. People before TLOTR:ttt(The Lord of the Rings: The two towers) <BR>has hailed the fellow ship of the ring a visual incredible \\"epic\\" of TLOTR's trilogy, but it is absolutley NOTHING compared to this movie. Lord of the rings fan that hasn't seen this movie yet, this is the movie for you to see! I've already seen it twice! The movie is spectacular, the actors performance in the movie is PERFECT. Gollumn is great.(or smeagle, shall I say?) See this movie epic action adventure movie fans!!-)

B00006YXEK|5.0|Having reviewed the album under the regular edition; i don't want to repeat myself too much or much less repeat what others have already said better...hence my delay in writing this...<br />In short, just the album which is included in this box set is worth the five stars in of itself. The album kicks off where Wilburys 3 left off with 'any road' and from there goes to to tracks which seem to sum up Harrison's solo career from All things Must Pass to Cloud Nine...my favorites are the beatlesque 'Rising Sun', the ethereal instrumental 'Marwa Blues',and poignant 'Stuck inside a Cloud' that avoids turning into sentimental slush with some maturing lyrics ...also there is the dreamy Somewhere in England type ballad 'Never Get Over You' ...the albums ends with Harrison in a Rutles like inspiration (i guesse he was entitled to tap into the Rutles legacy as he admitted their profound influence on his music), with the track 'brainwashed'.<br />...i still think the track from the jools holland album 'horse to the water' could have a great placement on this album especially where the midtempo numbers start to accumulate; just for a little change of pace.<br />...however i love this album and i still have yet to tire of it...hopefully one day there will be a sequel as jim keltner, the drummer has said in an interview that he had added drum tracks to more than what was included on the album...<br />having said that, i find that this box set is a must for those of us who are mainly harrison fans, as Harrison materiel is sadly lacking in the music bins...you can find DVD's and whole discographies CD's of many lesser acts; but there is no official DVD yet that I know of that is Harrison; so this 8 minute DVD on this box set will have to hold us until we get the official DVD of Harrison videos that Dhani told me in that MSN chat would hopefully come out after his holiday...<br />...so until official Harrison DVd's come out, of his concerts, videos, etc..,this DVd here in this box is all we have...<br />...the box is nice in of itself with the etched \\"OM\\"'s that reminds me of the \\"all Things Must Pass\\" box...there is also the poster but the Vinyl release has this poster in much better condition (less folds and bigger) so i would also recommend the vinyl release...this sticker is nice (would love to have a few of these to stick around but it's more of collectable keepsake)<br />..as for the guitar pick, it's very small-would have been nicer had it been a bit bigger- a minor quibble-it's a nice little touch but it's nothing to get really excited about...<br />...the thing to get excited about is that finally we have a new Harrison album, imbued with his guitar and sound..and a short DVD that has no fat on it and gives us a brief intimate look at Harrison in his studio...a full performance of \\"betwwen the devil...' could have been placed here but i guesse that's being saved for the video anthology...ve...<BR>...the box is nice in of itself with the etched \\"OM\\"'s that reminds me of the \\"all Things Must Pass\\" box...there is also the poster but the Vinyl release has this poster in much better condition (less folds and bigger) so i would also recommend the vinyl release...this sticker is nice (would love to have a few of these to stick around but it's more of collectable keepsake)<BR>..as for the guitar pick, it's very small-would have been nicer had it been a bit bigger- a minor quibble-it's a nice little touch but it's nothing to get really excited about...<BR>...the thing to get excited about is that finally we have a new Harrison album, imbued with his guitar and sound..and a short DVD that has no fat on it and gives us a brief intimate look at Harrison in his studio...a full performance of \\"betwwen the devil...' could have been placed here but i guesse that's being saved for the video anthology...

B00006LSM3|5.0|George will remain in my heart with this CD.  It is the best of the best of George Harrison.  It seems that this is always what he wanted to accomplish.
630469654X|4.0|I love this movie very much. I liked the film's  storybook feel, and the theme of starcrossed lovers. The story is very charming. Isabeau is lovely- apprently vulnerable, but actually strong. Navarre is truly your knight in shining armor...and the thief and the monk are quite funny and enjoyable to watch. What makes viewing this movie painful is the terrible, unfortunate soundtrack. What were they thinking?? It sounds like it's straight out of one of those little Casio machines they used to sell at airports in the 80s. Even the music on some of those cheesy local furniture store ads that are broadcast on cable sound better! They should re-release this movie with a new soundtrack- as another reviewer said- something Celtic maybe- anything, but this! The four stars are for the movie- it would have been five, but for the soundtrack.
B00006WUWN|2.0|I bought this DVD with the expectation that the third Austin Powers movie would be at least as funny as the preceding two ones: well, all I can say is that I can't remember having laughed many times... Apart from this, I think that the plot could have been a lot better: the movie just doesn't seem to proceed right after the opening scenes (which I think are great by the way) I also got the impression that the producers have 'borrowed' too much from the first two movies, which made me feel like I was watching a new version of the the second Austin Powers movie... Many jokes from the first two movies are 'revised'...  Also, I think that the new Goldmember character has not contributed much to the movie and is more like bizarre than funny...<BR>All in all, I would recommend you to buy the the first two Austin Powers movies which are much funnier than this one...
1558216847|5.0|A true story about the author's flight to freedom. It is a reading experience I wouldn't want to miss. The author's account of his time in prison and the following trek to Camp 303 are frankly terrifying. I still find it quite impossible that people survive this trek. The flight doesn't seem any less a hardship, but is for obvious reasons more cheerful.<br />Still two month after reading this book, I am moved beyond words.
0316666343|5.0|This book started out sad and tragic, but in every cloud, well, you know the rest.  This is a story about tragedy turned into triumph narrated from a young girl who has just left the earth and is now in heaven looking down.  It's a story of hope.  It made me laugh and cry, but in the end it uplifted me.  Another book I would recommend that lifted my spirits is called, The Little Guide To Happiness.  It made me laugh without the tears.  I highly recommend these books.  I can't wait for the movie version of Lovely Bones.
B00005JLRR|4.0|After the vast disappointment Paramount gave us with \\"Insurrection\\" (one of the worst of the series), they make up for that loss with #10 in the long-running series of, in my opinion, the best sci-fi movie series ever.  The plot is pretty imaginative, all except for the clone part, which seems pretty run-of-the-mill sci-fi stuff after \\"Episode II\\" and the \\"Austin Powers\\" movies.  But, the plot simply wouldn't be as good, or work as well, without it, and it is handled very well.  The plot is, however, at times somewhat confusing and underplayed, but not much.  And one can easily spot some similarities between this and other previous Trek films; \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" most of all, as well as \\"The Undiscovered Country\\", and even a dab or two of \\"The Search For Spock\\".  But these aside, it's a highly enjoyable movie, and makes a worthy end to the big screen voyages of Picard n' crew.  The whole Enterprise (which, by the way, looks better than ever) crew is in top form, of course.  The guy who plays Shinzon gives a highly entertaining, and different, performance.  While not trying to be as menacing as a Klingon or Khan, he gives a stand-out performance as the \\"Nemesis\\" of the title (and he really does look like a younger Patrick Stewart).  The ending is exciting and tense; yet, there is a sense of sadness as well (especially ********* to ruin it would be futile), but also of hope...........as with \\"The Undiscovered Country\\", which was the last voyage of the original Enterprise crew.<br />\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" is well-worth seeing on the big screen, and is certainly tied with \\"First Contact\\" as the best of the Next Generation film series.  Well worth the 4-year wait!<br />(Now I wonder if they'll make a film series of \\"Deep Space Nine\\", which I think would be interesting to see;  I haven't seen more than one full episode of that series, but what I remember of it was really boring.  but it had a great theme!  And after that, maybe films of \\"Voyager\\"?  \\"Enterprise\\"?)
0676973779|5.0|My son loves this book simply as a fairy tale.  But, for us adults, if we look between the lines, there is alot more depth than a charming story.  And alot of it is spiritual in nature. My favorite spiritual book that I would recommend is, I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You. It is the best book ever and I would be remiss if I didn't mention it here.  Yet, The Life of Pi rates right up there with my favorite spiritual inspiration.
B00003CXSM|5.0|This is a perfect movie to watch with friends while snuggled up with popcorn. Jennifer Lopez is fabulous with Matthew McConaughey who both are great in this romantic comedy. This movie not only keeps you laughing but it has a twist that will keep your mind turning. This movie is worth owning if you like a good laugh and wonderful acting.
0446530573|4.0|This cookbook will give you step-by-step directions to eating Soprano style (try Carm's Ziti or the Sunday Gravy!), and it's also packed with pictures and interviews with cast memember. The interviews and text can be a little corny at times, but the recipes are solid italian food at it's best.
0451523938|5.0|I have been fascinated by the concept of this classic work of Stevenson for years, but never took time to read it until now.  It is a very quick, easy read, more like a short story than an actual novel.  Some persons have misunderstood this book as a detective mystery rather than a psychological reflection upon the dual natures residing within every person.  Stevenson here strikes a chord within us all by illustrating the potential darkness and evil of even the most exemplary of individuals.<br />The introduction by Vladimir Nabokov, included with this version, is best read after the story itself.  Nabokov's analysis is difficult to follow if the reader is not acquainted with the details of the plot.  He provides valuable, thought-provoking insights into what Stevenson has accomplished in this timeless tale.<br />I strongly recommend this classic to pastors, psychologists, and other persons who are interested in learning more about the struggle between good and evil within each human being.
B00005JKL8|4.0|I thought this was a good, almost realistic movie right from the start. The military-type action is almost non-stop and will surely drag any guy into watching it for any length of time. The storyline is basically about two Navy jet fighter pilots who stray off course, and inadvertantely take some pictures of stuff that they shouldn't have seen. After being spotted, they are shot down, and now run for their lives through the war torn country side in the middle of polictical upheavel. There is a final scene with intense action and the movie tends to keep you on the edge of your seat. The only scene I didn't like was at the end, which without blowing the end, will just say was mildly unrealistic in the last action sequence. This DVD is almost a good buy for any guy, and could be bought for soemone as a gift without worry. I rated this 4 stars and feel that it is a good buy. It is in my collection as I love the military movies. I heard that this was based on a true story, but am not sure about that part.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Wow!  This is the best, most accurate representation of WWII I've ever seen.  I had already read the book by Stephen Ambrose and I thought it was the best book I had ever read.  It really showed how horrible war was and made you appreciate what these men did.  Then I heard that the miniseries was being released on dvd and video.  I knew I had to have it.  Well, it simply put, is the best thing I've ever watched.  The soldiers emotions are conveyed so well in this movie.  The struggles these men overcome are amazing.  This movie/miniseries is also very sad.  I don't know how the men of Easy Company handled this in real life because it is very difficult to come to grips with even in the movie/miniseries.  You must buy this if you have any interest in war and the like.  The combat in this movie is right in step with the book and it's really amazing as most movies have to cut corners when doing a movie/miniseries on a book.  Congratulations Mr. spielburg and Mr. Hanks, you've got a real winner on your hands with band of brothers
B00005YW4H|5.0|The album defines easy listening ! Nearly all the songs are slow and Jazz fans would definitely want to pick one up.
B000002C1W|5.0|What is wrong with some of you Floyd fans, Gilmour did an exellent job on this album and I believe that this is the last Floyd album because the Division Bell was so immature although the songs on it were catchy, but the lyrics were weak and it was still not Pink Floyd in style.  AMLOR has a certain darkness to it when you listen to it (and when you look at the CD Booklet) and it really reminds you of the past Floyd days.  Waters said it himself, Momentary Lapse Of Reason has good tunes on it.  Even though the Division Bell nailed no. 1.  I thought it was an immature album.  Great job on this one Dave!
B000002LIM|5.0|This is the best work of Danny Elfman and contains one of the best themes for a superhero out there. The music is bold, brassy, heroic, mighty, and percussive. It contains outstanding orchestral music that soars and never lets up. The Batman march is an extraordinary work that is used in almost every action cue, when Batman does something heroic. The music is mainly dark and gothic, which represents the dark knight and Gotham City perfectly. The dark, ominous music which is mixed with child-like rhythms and awesome action and adventurous music makes this score an incredible and thrilling ride. The action music really shines in &quot;Roof Fight&quot;, &quot;First Confrontation&quot;, &quot;Batman to the Rescue&quot;, &quot;Charge of the Batmobile&quot;, &quot;Attack of the Batwing&quot;, &quot;Up the Cathedral&quot;, and &quot;The Final Confrontation&quot;. The love theme is also good and includes bits and pieces of Prince's song &quot;Scandalous&quot;, which can also be found in &quot;Kitchen, Surgery, Face-Off&quot; and one tiny part of &quot;Finale&quot;. &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; by Stephen Foster is thrown in the score in various parts, such as &quot;Photos/Beautiful Dreamer&quot; (you think!), &quot;Finale&quot;, and a tiny snippet if you listen closely toward the end of &quot;Final Confrontation&quot;. The Joker's theme is a comedic like waltz that shows off the funny side of the villain. &quot;Descent Into Mystery&quot; contains great choral passages, along with wonderful string work and an explosion of the main theme. &quot;Finale&quot; is one of the best finales I have ever heard in a film score. It is powerful, awesome, mighty, bold, noble, and heroic. We are finally left with the &quot;Batman Theme Reprise&quot; which states his musical voice one last time. This is a truly awesome score that is without a doubt, one of the best and most powerful scores out there.
B00005JL78|4.0|\\"Minority Report\\" is Steven Spielberg's second foray into Sci-fi in a row, following last year's \\"A.I.\\" The famed director made his mark in this genre with \\"ET\\" and \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\". Today we have a more mature Spielberg, albeit one still obsessed with gadgets. The themes are darker, more complex, more ambiguous. The wonder the younger, rather naive Spielberg held for technology has turned to suspicion. The earlier films were more accessible and certainly drew larger audiences, but his current work does more to cement his reputation as a master filmmaker, as well as a master of the technology he now cautions us about.<br />\\"Minority Report\\" takes place half a century from now. A genetic experiment has created `precogs', a small group of people who can see a murder before it happens. Computers can read their thoughts, and by using these, the government has been able to establish its Pre Crime division. In Washington DC, the murder rate has fallen to virtually zero, and there is a big push to use this program nationwide. Pre Crime's chief detective, John Anderton [Tom Cruise] believes the `precogs' are infallible until the day they give his name as the soon-to-be murderer of a man he's never heard of. What ensues is a thrilling story of a man on the run who is caught up in a web of mystery and deception.<br />There are some flaws in the movie. These include a couple of rather large plot holes, some improbable escapes, and the tendency to have the computer generated special effects make the hero jump higher and fall further than is humanly possible. What a master like Spielberg is able to do it to succeed despite the problems inherent in a project. He is able to add layers which distract, intrigue and challenge us. He can take a present day phenomenon, such as the explosion in media technology, and imagine where it might take us in the future. He can take an ordinary, familiar action hero type and make him memorable. He can make us think while alsoentertaining us.
B000002AT6|5.0|This is without a doubt the best James Horner score i've ever heard. This is also some of the most beautiful music i've ever heard. It is a lavish, sweeping, romantic, and delightful score. \\"Legends of the Fall\\" is a breathtaking theme that really is gorgeous and phenomenal. \\"The Ludlows\\" contains a wonderful string theme that also is breathtaking. Some action music can be found in \\"Samuel's Death\\" which contains some sad and ominous parts in it as well. Alfred's theme which is introduced in \\"Alfred Moves To Helena\\" is a more sorrowful string theme than the other ones, but still excellent. \\"Revenge\\" contains the Japanese wood flute, the shakuhachi, that Horner uses a lot in his scores. The last 2 tracks finish off the soundtrack wonderfully with the main themes soaring into the heavens one last time, leaving the listener breathless. This is a score that will always remain at the top and never cease to anything less. An extraordinarily beautiful and epic score.
0064407667|4.0|The Baudelaire kids are suddenly orphaned when their parents are killed in a fire. The kids must be sent to live with a relative and the vile Count Olaf seems to be the most handy one. But the Count hardly has the kids' best interests in mind and he cooks up a terrible scheme to get his hands on the kids' inheritance.<br />This is a pretty enjoyable book. With every horrible event that happened to the kids I found myself wondering how far the author would go. The kids themselves had cute little personalities and it was great to see them find ingenious ways to overcome their problems. I plan on reading the rest of the series if I can get them from the library. Ten bucks is a bit expensive for a book I can read in about an hour. Parents may want to consider buying them because kids will most likely want to read them many times.
B00005JL2O|4.0|AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMEBER is a fun and fantastic film for those who like, farce, parody and just movies that break that fourth wall and talk to the camera. Michael Meyers (I Married An Axe Murderer, Shrek) is a creative genius with this character and if all he did was make these movies - he would make the world a much better place.<br />This story takes us back in time to the 70's and even farther back to when Austin Powers, Nigel and even Dr. Evil were in High School together. Keep in mind that Mike Meyers plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, Fat Bastard. He does an amazing job and you can't even tell it is him.<br />Directed by Jay Roach (Meet The Parents, Mystery, Alaska) the film tells the tale of 7's undercover agent Foxy Brown played by Beyonce Knowles (know for the pop group Destiny's Child) who helps track the whereabouts of the Evil Dr. Evil and the disgusting dead skin eating Goldmemeber.<br />Everyone is back - including Michael York (Logan's Run, Island Of Dr. Monroe) as Secret Defense Leader Nigel and Seth Green (Rock Star, Rat Race) as Dr. Evil misguided and somewhat confused son.<br />The most amazing thing is all the cameo appearances that are in the movie and how they got everyone to do a minute or two in the film. People like Steven Speilberg, Tom Cruise, Gweneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny Divito and Nathan Lane to name a few.<br />The DVD is phenomenal and besides all the extras, the best part is the revoicing studio where you actually put your own voice over the characters and play as if you were in the movie. The extra's including the commentary are extremely funny.<br />If you have the other two - this is a must have - if you have never seen it - be prepared to laugh hysterically. Get it - you'll love it! (12-31-02)
B00005JL95|4.0|To be frank, I was losing faith in Disney's ability to create an original piece of entertainment.  If it is not a Pixar project, the Disney Animation arm seems creatively adrift.  With lackluster efforts like \\"Treasure Planet,\\" \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" failing to catch fire, hearing the title LILO AND STITCH made me scratch my head in wonder.  However, Disney is king when it comes to marketing and the host of teaser trailers used to position the film were inspired.  After watching the unsusual looking Stitch wreck the worlds of Belle, Aladdin and Ariel, I was definitely curious.  After seeing LILO AND STITCH over the summer, I was hooked.  Now, the film is on VHS and DVD and it maintains its luster and appeal in a repeated viewing.<br />A winning combination of sly humor, moral lessons and Elvis, LILO AND STITCH is a much better experience than MONSTERS INC and ICE AGE.  LILO AND STITCH is very much a personal film, full of warmth and humanity, elements that are even reflected by the animation itself.  While the digitial art of Pixar and the recent SHREK continue to enchant audiences, it is also a cold filmmaking experience to view.  The Hawaiian fantasia of L&S is as welcome as the heroine herself.<br />What I also found gratifying was how the filmmakers did not parody the ethnicity of their source material.  Some may say the look of Lilo and gang is exaggerated, but after the Barbie Doll look of  \\"Pocohontas,\\" it was nice to see characters who were not aerobicized.<br />If anything, it promotes a more normal body aesthetic  for children. However, the real jewel of L&S, however, are its two main characters.<br />Stitch is wonderfully fun, a mass of audacity and recklessness that had me, well, in stitches.  He's the anti-Tigger, full of abandon and sloppy charm. Some parents took issue with his brazen and gross habits, but he made me cheer.  As for Lilo, she's the outsider we all were at that age.  Innocent to a degree, she's also keenly aware of her world and her quest to forge a friendship with Stitch is tender and real.  The film is about family and its many shapes.  It may be an overtly simplified message, and the script does offer a few clunker sections of dialogue, but there is no denying its impact at the end.  Much of this succeeds with its great voice cast, especially Daveigh Chase and Tia Carrere.<br />Sure, it has a slow beginning and the space chase at the end goes on way too long, but  this is a memorable Disney effort and one of the year's true delights.  Besides, having the King play a key role in any animated film is something everyone should experience once!of her world and her quest to forge a friendship with Stitch is tender and real.

B00005JLRR|4.0|STAR TREK X: NEMISIS is the supposed last of the Star Trek films in the 36 year history of Star Trek originally conceived by Gene Roddenberry (Andromeda, Earth:Final Conflict) back in 1964. Directed by Stuart Baird (Executive Decision, US MArshals) the film has a dark tone. This film is definitely more interesting than the last installment (Insurrection), but not quiet as good as First Contact. I think the tone of the film is what missed its mark for me. There was too much talking between Shinzon played by ??? (  ) and Captain Picard played by the always brilliant Patrick Stewart ( ) and exposition and not enough for the other characters to do.<br />The star for this film was Data, played by Brent Spinner (Out To Sea, The Master Of Disguise ) playing a duel role as the ever misfitted android and an duplicate \\"brother\\" called B4. The scenes of his light-hearted humor, curiosity, quick wit and heroism make this film very enjoyable. Problem because Brent was also one of the three who came up with the story idea as well with producer Rick Berman (Enterprise, Deep Space Nine, Voyager) and screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator, The TimeMachine, Any Given Sunday).<br />The story is simple - but a little weird. Captain Picard was cloned by the Romulans (the Bad Guys) in order to be replaced in the Federation an infiltrate the \\"Good Guys\\". Due to a change of politics and governments - the plan was abandoned and the clone grew up under hardship to become the future destructor of planet Earth. Yawn....<br />Now the real action takes place more than half-way into the movie where Shinzon's ship gets rammed by the Enterprise. From that point the forward the movie is a roller coaster. And, thanks to Data, who destroys the most deadliest weapon known in the Universe - the Earth is saved. Data even has a moment where the audience cheered!<br />The supporting cast gets second seat in this film and even Jonathan Frakes (Clockstoppers, Thunderbirds ) gets a decent fight scene in this, butnot a great contributor to the plot overall. Mr. Frakes did a great job directing First Contact.<br />There are cute scenes, wedding reception scenes, love making scenes, there is even some off-roading too  - but over-all it takes the last 40 minutes to get you involved. Also there is an emotional ending that may shock Star Trek fans - the two who didn't know anything about it. <br />The score is by the incredible Jerry Goldsmith ( ) and the special effects are top notch and completely believable. Overall Star Trek fans should be satisfied and the non Trekker will enjoy the detailed ending - just wished it had me humor and more for the other characters to do. Go see it and tell me what you think! (12-22-02) 3x
0140186409|3.0|I have mixed feelings on how to rate this book.  The reality of it and the way it follows the depression are excellent. I give it a five on accuracy and detail.  BUT....  I really believe it's only worth reading it if you don't mind horrible, depressing, sad endings.  I was very dissapointed.  I felt like I was reading a history book instead of a reading book because for me, a book I'm reading for fun, should at least have a satisfing, if not happy, ending.  In history books anything bad can happen and in this case it did.  The situation in the end was hopless.
B00005JLS0|2.0|TWO WEEKS NOTICE was a cute film but missed the mark unlike its predecessor Maid In Manhattan which was more real and entertaining. Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) produced this film as well as stars in it. Her performance although I am sure is honest seemed a little held back playing the Harvard Lawyer fighting for the down-and-under trod.<br />While the other side of the coin, there is the rich millionaire played by Hugh Grant (Nine Months, Notting Hill) was a more outgoing, non-caring and flamboyant wisp that almost didn't match to well with Sandra.<br />It ran a little slow and seemed much more predictable toward the end. Written and directed by Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) the movie seemed very slow in pace. Robert Klein (Primary Colors, One Fine Day) gives a standout performance as Sandra's father that is worth noting.<br />This is a good movie for the video and DVD - but theatrically it was a little disappointing.

B00005JKL8|4.0|If you're looking for a fast-paced, no brainer movie, then Behind Enemy Lines is a good movie.  To enjoy this movie, you have to accept that there are some too heroic and impossible scenes, but get over it.  Another thing: don't expect a Black Hawk Down equivalent!
0151008116|5.0|A wonderful book by Yann Martel.<br />Winner of the Man Booker prize and finalist for The Governor General's Award and The Commonwealth Writers Prize.<br />An easy to read, compelling work of fiction that is almost impossible to put down. Martel's character, Pi, is from India and has typical English based, down to earth sense of humor, that lends itself perfectly to the telling of this tale.  It is realistic to the point that you begin to think \\" mmm, maybe this is based on a true event! \\".  You exult in his highs and despair during his low moments: but you never doubt his instincts for survival.<br />All in all a most enjoyable work: Highly recommended !
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album is fantastic. It comtains a combination of song that reached out to a great deal of people. The most famous song beig all the things she said, off course. But personaly \\"Show me love\\" and \\"30 minutes\\" are my favorites. \\"How soon is now\\" oh my God, what a great chose to cover. I loved it as the title song of \\"Charmed\\". And \\"Malchik gay\\", great beat and very nice lyrics. I can honestly say, that I have never owned a better and nicer album than this one. It contains everything I like and it is created and written so well. Lovely girls with great talent. I admire girls that age coming out for the way they are. Woh, woh, woh. Mega.
B000000W9Z|5.0|I am David Bowies biggest fan ever... I know every lyric of every song he's ever even thought of releasing. Outside is by far my favorite Bowie album. It is amazing. It is dark, but fun. No two songs on it are remotley the same. Outside is the best album I've ever heard... I've worn out about 5 copies of it and have to keep stocking up on Outside CD's, because they go everywhere with me. Its one of those albums that you can listen to once, smile, then listen to it again... and again and again and again... A MUST HAVE!!!
B000021YQV|4.0|Listen to it for what's wrong.  This may sound absurd, but what's right with &quot;Toxicity&quot; is what's wrong.  The extremely odd signature changes, the weird voice that Sarje puts forward, and the reverse genious-genious guitar that's played make this record incredible.  This is just hard-core head-banging music at it's best. Pick this one up or some heart stopping music.
B000065FX9|5.0|Okay, so the first ten minutes werent exactly the most thrilling, I hate a movie that gives away the ending at the very beginning, but the songs were beautifully sung, amazing that the actors themselves sang it. Especially \\"Your Song\\" sung by Ewan Mcgregor, I never would have believed his voice could sound so beautiful, and he hit the tunes perfectly. The plot wasnt corrupted by the songs and dances, but actually blended in giving it a wonderful depth into the movie.<br />The actor I was most amazed by was Ewan Mcgregor. I had seen him in Star Wars and thought him to be quite cute, but Moulin Rouge literally got me hooked on him. A definite must for fans of Ewan. :)<br />Finally, I just like to say for a movie I couldnt bare to watch the first ten minutes of, I now beg my parents to buy it for me. Give it a chance, its a beautiful story with wonderful actors.
0691023565|4.0|How does a teacher go about teaching? It is a hard trick. Written and published in the `40s, and then again subsequently Polya's \\"How to Solve It\\" is an attempt to describe the general paths to the student's Eureka! moments. As such it is also of interest to those who go about the task of discovery, and you must constantly rethink their strategies, in the face of a stubborn unknown.<br />Polya's consideration of the Various Approaches to problem solving hangs on several key structural bands that take the forms of a teacher's questions: Do you know any related problem? Do you know an analogous problem? [Parallelograms are considered.] Here is a problem related to yours and solved before. Can you use it? Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its use possible?<br />These ring true to this recently mustered parental pedantic. <br />Polya's actual treatise is just 30 pages; the associated `dictionary' definitions section is quite extended, actually, making up some 200 pages. He describes going back to first principles in problem solving. January 1, 2003 is a day perhaps to remember such back tracking is sometimes in order.
630157401X|5.0|My opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentless awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to.<br />The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film above the others in the trilogy. The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises. <br />The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by adding more characterization, particularly with origin of Indy himself. And as a whole, the story is more engrossing because there are more fun clues offered toward the location of the Holy Grail and, thus, more engaging little discoveries (love the \\"X marks the spot\\" scene).  I'm quite certain, like with Raiders, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen the movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up, which I suppose speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances.<br />Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score), the best being an excellent ten-minute setpiece on board (and in) a Nazi tank in a sensational chase sequence across the desert.  The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown, which is the pinnacle adventure movies aspire to.<br />Harrison Ford once again slides effortlessly into the role of Jones, delivering another first-rate turn. To some, the performance is a joke; to most, it's acting at its finest. But I think most everyone would agree nobody else could have fit the part half as well as Ford. It's his rapport with Connery that strikes that spark that separates this from 99% of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond unlike any duo in film history. You could call it a buddy picture, I suppose, but unlike any you've ever seen before. The Last Crusade is a knockout thrill ride, and I seriously doubt any action/adventure will ever surpass it.
0385495323|5.0|Simon Singh is an incredible writer.  While I was already familiar with much of the material he covered (many of these ciphers will be used in a college class on cryptography or computer security), I simply couldn't put this book down; his skill in telling the history of cryptography makes this a must-read.  <br />While this is an easy-to-read book, not a textbook, the interested reader will find instructions for solving various ciphers, letter frequency charters, and even a famous unsolved cipher.  I highly recommend this for anyone interested in codes and ciphers.
B00004SC3M|5.0|First off, I'm tired of people harping on the age difference bewteen CZJ and Sean.  Some of the classic Hollywood pairings have been older men with younger women: Bogie/Bacall, Clark Gable/Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn, even Julia Roberts/Richard Gere.  So...move on.  What matters is if the pair work well together, and Catherine and Sean are great together.  By the way they never actually hook up, but if they had, it would have been very intense.  The chemistry between the 2 was very evident to me throughout the entire movie, I was egging on a romance.  But Sean's character is above the physical involvement level with partners, so Catherine is held at bay.  The movie reminded me of a classic thriller, a movie loaded with action...but thank God, not an &quot;action movie&quot;.  Enough of a hint at romance to keep us gals interested...but certainly not a romance.  And on top of everything it was smart and well done. It took me on lots of twists and turns, and I loved them all.  I'd gladly watch Catherine Zeta-Jones &amp; Sean Connery (now 3 years older) re-pair in a sequel.  By the way...I'm 19, and I'd take 53 year old Richard Gere any day over some of the young guys I see posing and looking pretty in movies today.  As long as we see more Sigorney Weaver in Tadpole type roles for women  (older woman dates younger man) keep 'em coming.
B00000ILE7|1.0|Not only the worst in the series, but has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It ruins it for wanting to see Ressurection. Now I've seen alot of bad movies, but this was horrible. I was expecting it to be good since Alien and Aliens were equally great, but I've never seen one like this. From the beginning, everything Ripley did in Aliens, saving Hicks and the girl was a waste. But it just gets worse.                     ***DO NOT LET KIDS VIEW THIS!*** It literally says the F word 40xs! It's in every single sentence.... Definatly rated R for a reason. Don't even waste $3 on it. Just skip this one.
B000066744|5.0|I've adored this movie from the beginning to the Hong Kong DVD to the Canadian DVD and now the Italian DVD which is 169 minutes long and has a second disc with interviews and how the movie was made, etc.<br />This longer version adds even more magic to this unforgettable film.  It's as though these wonderful, memorable characters came back to just tell you a few things more.  Most of the additional footage is in the first half of the film and no matter how well you know the shortened version, the additions are virtually seamless, making you think they were there all along.<br />For those who question why this film didn't do well originaly, it was released around the time of Cameron's &quot;Titanic&quot; and people had all the wrong expectations for this one.<br />The Italian version (in PAL format) has dialogue and subtitles in both English and Italian for not just the film, but the bonus materials too, so many (well, if you have a multi-region DVD player) people can enjoy.  This movie is reason enough to blast the studios for fighting all multi-region &quot;firmware&quot; out there for DVD players.  Otherwise, we'd have to go to Italy to see this version.  Ridiculous.<br />Oh, if you get it, turn on the subtitles--since they were done in Italy (the Canadian DVD has none), it seems they might be from the original script and you can compare them to the onscreen dialogue which is more idiomatic and character-driven.<br />Now can we please get the long version of &quot;Bagdad Cafe&quot; on DVD?  The one that runs on Bravo....
B00004U2EZ|5.0|this is one musical that's full of passion and affects the listener. it contains beautiful music and song, performed by some of the most awesome singers. (i especially love Bruno Pelletier and Daniel Lavoie. Pelletier's voice is clear and full of presence while Lavoie's voice brings a spine-chilling tone to the character and reveals a downright raw passion at times) The entire show is both provoking and moving. All the characters' thoughts and motives are shown clearly. Some of their inner conflicts are also revealed along the way. There are moments of quiet (like Florence and Ave Maria) and sheer power and energy (La Fete des Fous andLa Cour des Miracles) It's not just some love story being reflected here. This is a show not to be missed.
B0000262QW|5.0|I first came across this album in a used record store two days before graduating high school.  The title interested me.  I gave it a listen and found it to be pure musical magic!  The title song has many changes in mood while displaying Chick's mastery of Latin rhythms.  The original version of &quot;Crystal Silence&quot; finds Corea, Farrell, and Moreira in a quiet mood.  The original vocal version of &quot;What Game Shall We Play Today&quot; features Flora Purim's unique style of singing, and beautiful instrumental solos.  The second half kicks off with a lengthy version of &quot;Sometime Ago&quot; (the original version is found on Chick's PIANO IMPROVISATIONS, Vol. 1).  Check out Stanley Clarke's acoustic bass solo, and those Utopian lyrics by Neville Potter!  the song bleeds into one of Chick's true classics, &quot;La Fiesta&quot;. Chick has an amazing affinity for Spanish music.  RETURN TO FOREVER is a true &quot;desert island pick&quot;, along with Bob James' TOUCHDOWN, Joe Sample's SPELLBOUND, and Dave Grusin's MOUNTAIN DANCE.

B00005JLD2|5.0|The year is 1931 and many well meaning leaders of Australia's dominant white culture share the view of British Chief Protector of Aborigines A. O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) that the Aborigine \\"in spite of himself, the native must be helped.\\" Doris Pilkington in 1996 wrote \\"Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" about the abduction of Molly (Everlyn Sampi), her younger sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and cousin Grace (Laura Monaghan) from their backward and illiterate surroundings. Their mother can offer them a loving home, but the government's educational facility can prepare them to participate more fully in the advanced world of the 20th Century. Director Phillip Noyce does not make the mistake and demonize Neville. The man's heart is truly in the right place. Neville is a racist who adheres to the pseudoscientific theories popular during that era. Surprisingly, his racism is not of the segregationist variety. Neville truly desires full integration of the Aborigine into Australian society. He realizes, quite accurately, that the future prospects of these children will dramatically improve if they become westernized. Regretfully, Neville fails to realize that he has no right to force assimilation upon these Aborigine families. The girls escape from the school and must travel over a thousand miles to return to the land of their ancestors. Neville will not rest until they are safely back in custody. The story revolves around their courageous high risk adventure in avoiding capture and surviving the brutal outback environment. The incredibly beautiful music of Peter Gabriel conveys the inner turmoil of both the benevolent dictators and their innocent and uncomprehending prey. Isn't some sort of compromise possible? Is there anyway of reaching a win-win result?<br />The new world is unrelentingly clashing with that of the old---and Western Civilization as defined by Matthew Arnold must ultimately prevail. The values of the West are nothing more than the championing of the best that has ever been said and written in human history. Race, ethnicity, and religion are not relevant factors. People of Caucasian pigmentation do not inherently have a monopoly on the truth. \\"Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" is a beautiful film dealing with the awkward issues surrounding the assimilation of the uninitiated into Western society. We are reminded that the so-called natives still have rights that cannot be ruthlessly ignored. The imposition of the minimal values underpinning a viable social order is warranted. After that, only the process of political and social conversion is acceptable. There is also no reason whatsoever to abandon the valid traditions of the indigenous culture. I strongly recommend that everyone in your family sees this powerful and spellbinding movie. It might also behoove me to add that the previously mentioned author Doris Pilkington is is the daughter of Molly.that has ever been said and written in human history.

B00004W50Z|5.0|I have read a lot of mixed reviews on this album.  I vote for this one being the Band's best.  The previous recording is great also, but Stage Fright is more musical and more fun to listen to in my opinion. Stage Fright has well written lyrics, and great musicianship.  It was a deviation for the group, but to me it was a positive development.  &quot;The Rumor&quot; is one of their best songs ever.  &quot;Sleeping&quot; is simply a top notch recording. &quot;Stage Fright&quot; was probably one of their best played tunes.  This album is simply full of good things.
0066214122|3.0|Michael Crichton has clearly developed a formula for his writings .  He begins with the theme that technology often advances more rapidly than the understanding of the implications of that technology, adds some techno-babble, mixes in a few high octane action scenes, and voila:  an instant best seller.<br />Other than the slightly darker ending, Prey doesn't deviate from the formula.  Judging by the sales figures on Crichton's books, it's pretty obvious that this style hasn't cost him any readers.  Yet, one can't help but feel that this book is treading over well worn ground.  The technology being discussed may change, but the style in which it's discussed doesn't.  I suppose that Crichton sees no need to change his method.  But given his obvious talent, one hopes for a little more than just formula. <br />For Crichton fans, Prey does not disappoint.  The book is another excellent display of Crichton's ability to marry cutting edge ideas with solid action sequences.  But, there really isn't anything new in Crichton's presentation to make the book memorable.  Consequently, Prey is much like a roller coaster one has ridden several times:  it's still fun, but it has lost its ability to surprise.
B00006GA48|4.0|The original version of this CD was terrible.  It sounded worse than the vinyl record.  I still can't believe that Capitol have the nerve to release it that way.  The remastered version is substantially better.  Closer to Home again has its full fidelity and sounds better than ever.  This is the album that shows Grand Funk at its best.  The playing is energetic and tight.  The arrangements are excellent, and it really is quite amazing that there are only three band members here.  <BR>The remastered CD may need some tone control adjustments.  The sound will come through strong and clear though.

You have the Wolf on vocals with the Rolling Stones rhythm section and Eric Clapton playing some nice stuff on lead guitar. with Stevie Winwood in there somewhere too.<br />I have heard better versions of Wang Dang Doodle, but the rest of the songs are excellent.<br />A unique album that showcases Howlin' Wolf, the like of whom we will not see again. However, I am not sure that this is his very best work, as I have a Live In Europe album from a 1964 concert in Bremen that has Hubert Sumlin on guitar and that wonderful pianist Sunnyland Slim in the band, along with Willie Dixon on bass, and to be honest, the somewhat younger Wolf sounds vocally stronger, as he really stretches out with a great band in a live performance. But this London album is still a nice listen and gets three stars from me.<br />As I have posted a number of reviews, here is what I mean by my star ratings:<br />* A really worthless CD<br />** A CD that has some good stuff, but some major defects.<br />*** An OK CD that will please fans of the artist in question.<br />**** An excellent CD that represents the best work of the artist in question and can be bought with confidence.<br />***** An absolute classic that is the best, or among the best, of its genre.

There are some songs on this CD which will make you laugh because they represent the innocence of the fifties (Wooden Heart) followed by stunning rockers (Hound dog, Heartbreak Hotel) which you will simply have to move to. <br />You do not have to like Elvis to enjoy this, if you love music you will like this.
6305176299|5.0|This is an incredibly exciting and moving film, and the rush of adrenaline<BR>it provides hardly lets up for a second. And, unlike so many films with their complicated plot lines and twists that leave you feeling confused and irritated, it tells a very simple, if somewhat implausible, story that is easy to follow and understand and that might happen to any of us. <br />I'd put this film ahead of even \\"Die Hard\\" because this film has something which DH doesn't have; an appeal to both sexes. DH was a man's film. John McClane had only a wife so that negated any opportunity for romance. But in this film, without interfering with the action, they manage to interweave a fairy-tale romance between two extraordinarily good looking and attractive young people. Jack (Keanu Reeves) is the superlative dare-devil hero; fearless and bold, strong and muscular, kind and gentle, highly intelligent and ready to lay down his life in the fight against evil and to save Annie (Sandra Bullock) the lovely  young woman he has come to love. And his love is returned. How could  it not be when they have shared such danger together and he, with all the attributes of a story book hero, has proved his worth many times over? And she only a frightened young girl looking to him for protection  and salvation. He is a  woman's dream; a knight on a white charger. And she is a man's dream; an intelligent, spirited, and brave woman, but one who is frightened and dependant and in need of protection.<br />The heart-rending way he stays with her near the end to face almost  certain death, when he could so easily have saved himself and left her alone to die, proved his commitment and love. I don't know which I  admired most in this film; the non-stop action and dramatic tension, or  the  tender love story. What a combination! No wonder the film did so  well at the box office.
B00005JKCH|4.0|The first SPIDER-MAN film had a long gestation period, passing from director to director (James Cameron was probably the best known), before landing on Sam Raimi--who does an awesome job of pulling it all together.  I'm thinking this extended pre-production phase really helped develop the story too.<br /><br />This is the way to make a great comic book hero movie: treat the story as seriously as the characters in it would live it.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful (except I'm not that wild about Kirsten Dunst, she just isn't comic book babe material), the story keeps slinging along, and the cameos are fun.<br /><br />A great way to start a franchise!
B00003XACV|4.0|This is a fantastic piece of work. Thomas (cousin of &quot;Short People&quot; Randy Newman and son of the late Alfred Newman) has created several sonic masterpieces and this one is certainly one of my favorites. I fell in love with the music while watching the movie for the first time in a theatre in Taipei - I got online as soon as I returned to my hotel room and ordered it. I continue to pull it out a lot more often than I ever expected.<BR>The only disappointment with the disc is poor quality of the mastering process, with a low dynamic range that sometimes gets in the way of the creative instrumentation of this CD. This is a nit, however, and I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for highly creative music.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|...What you need to know about this album, and the other reviews stress it too, is that it's not an Eminem album.  Its not going to be an essential to your CD player.  You won't hear people quoting lines from the songs all the time or anything like that (with the possible exception of Lose Yourself).  But once you take that into account you should like this.<br />Needless to say, this CD is almost all rap.  The first half is Eminem and everyone else signed onto Shady Records.  If you like the movie \\"8 Mile\\" or \\"The Eminem Show,\\" it should impress you.  If you thought Eminem should never have stopped the insanity of The Marshall Mathers LP, you might not be so impressed.  The songs are mostly about Rabbit, not Eminem.  The tracks with Obie Trice have good beats, but he's kind of a clown.  You can take 50 Cent a little more seriously.  Theres an OK D12 track.  Its not outstanding, but it's pretty good.  The first half is aimed more at Eminem fans.<br />The second half has a variety of people and is aimed at rap fans in general.  Jay-Z does a track that works very well.  Pretty good beat, pretty good chorus, pretty good rhymes, pretty good guest.  I've never once skipped that one.  Macy Gray and Boomkat (who?) provide an R&B track each, which is great if you like R&B.  I, for one, don't feel the need to listen to these all the way through.  Xzibit has a track that's tight if you like Xzibit.  The rhymes are good, but he only talks about how he's better than everyone else.  The Nas track is pathetic.  It's another Jay-Z diss, the reason I never liked Nas in the first place.  It's funny how Nas's rival contributes something to the album, but Nas doesn't.  The last few tracks are from lesser known rap people.  People know Rakim, but his day has passed and I don't know anything about the other two.  The tracks are OK, but you might not listen to them all the way through.  It ends with another no-chorus Eminem track that I like a lot.  It has fast rhyming and it works perfectly to end the album.<br />This CD is good, but not that good.  You might enjoy it, but you won't be deeply impressed.  Dont buy it if you don't like Eminem, and don't buy it expecting an Eminem album.  But if you like mainstream rap in general, this is probably for you.<br />Closing comments: How come Nas spends half the time talking about how he's the \\"last real ... alive\\" and he's God's Son and half making old ... jabs at Jay-Z?
B000002KZA|5.0|DM's previous two albums are quite poppy and somewhat sugary in sound. Nothing like this 1983 LP and the following albums that DM would become famous for, the previous two albums are both great in their own way. Released in 1983, \\"Construction Time Again\\" is from my perspective, where the foundation for Depeche Mode's darker, much gloomier music, was built.<br />This record, has a quirky industrial sound that ,while much darker than the glitzy-glamour pop of \\"Speak & Spell\\" may not greatly appeal to \\"Some Great Reward\\" forwards, but nonetheless, I think that this is a wonderful and unfortunately forgotten classic in Depeche Mode's early catalog. While there isn't anything that is very disturbing or frightening like \\"Master & Servant\\", \\"If You Want\\", or \\"Strangelove\\", \\"Construction Time Again\\" is a dark album and marks the doorway between the sugar-pop of pre-1983 Mode, and the industrial gloom rock of \\"Some Great Reward\\", \\"Black Celebration\\" and everything since then.<br />\\"Pipeline\\" and \\"Told You So\\" to me, are the weakest tracks on the LP and among DM's most uninspired and the former being quite annoying with the sound effects which sound like a malfunctioning construction crane or tractor. However, occasionally when one is in the right mood, even these can be enjoyable songs.<br />However, that is all made up for with strong and awesome songs like \\"Everything Counts:, \\"Love In Itself\\", and \\"The Landscape Is Changing\\". \\"Everything Counts\\" to me is the best song on the entire album, both the original and the 7+ minute 12 inch version with the calliope and the dark yet joyous atmosphere all mixed in one to create one of what I consider, one of the best songs ever made in Depeche Mode's early days and ends their joy-pop with a bang. \\"Shame\\" while not sunny daylight in mood, is dark yet has a sense of joy buried within its dark atmosphere. The same holds true with \\"Landscape Is Changing\\" and most of the rest of the album. I love the hazy ending of \\"Love In Itself\\" with the bizarre breezy sounds and the synthesizer dabblings before blasting into the upbeat, quirky, yet eerie \\"More Than A Party\\".<br />While there isn't anything that is very disturbing or frightening like \\"Master & Servant\\", \\"Fly On The Windscreen\\" or \\"Judas\\", \\"Construction Time Again\\" is a dark album and marks the doorway between the sugar-pop of pre-1983 Mode, and the industrial gloom rock of \\"Some Great Reward\\", \\"Black Celebration\\" and everything since then. \\"And Then\\" to me, is like the precursor to the much darker, and greyer feel of the next album \\"Some Great Reward\\" and would've fit well next to \\"Nothing\\" from the Music From The Masses LP although \\"And Then\\" is just plain fun in a campy way where as \\"Nothing\\" is nihilistic in mood. \\"And Then\\" is one of my favorite songs on the CD with it's odd style and acoustic guitars.<br />I don't care what detractors say, I think \\"Construction Time Again\\" as a whole, is a great album and definitely worth checking out. After this, Depeche Mode would become a completely different band. There is a compilation called \\"People Are People\\" that was released as a promo album that contains the long version of \\"Everything Counts\\" but instead of getting that album, get this one instead as \\"Everything Counts\\" is available here but if you're a die-hard fan like I am, go for the compilation I mentioned as \\"Now This Is Fun\\" and \\"Work Hard\\" do warrant having that album too. I find it impossible to deny that I actually love this album, in my own campy sort of way and it makes a nice break occasionally from the darker grounds of post-1985 DM.<br />And so begins a string of great albums that DM have created since then and continued with their most recent release \\"Exciter\\". Go and buy this CD. It's worth trying out. :-)with the bizarre breezy sounds and the synthesizer dabblings before blasting into the upbeat, quirky, yet eerie \\"More Than A Party\\". <br />While there isn't anything that is very disturbing or frightening like \\"Master & Servant\\", \\"Fly On The Windscreen\\" or \\"Judas\\", \\"Construction Time Again\\" is a dark album and marks the doorway between the sugar-pop of pre-1983 Mode, and the industrial gloom rock of \\"Some Great Reward\\", \\"Black Celebration\\" and everything since then. \\"And Then\\" to me, is like the precursor to the much darker, and greyer feel of the next album \\"Some Great Reward\\" and would've fit well next to \\"Nothing\\" from the Music From The Masses LP although \\"And Then\\" is just plain fun in a campy way where as \\"Nothing\\" is nihilistic in mood. \\"And Then\\" is one of my favorite songs on the CD with it's odd style and acoustic guitars. <br />I don't care what detractors say, I think \\"Construction Time Again\\" as a whole, is a great album and definitely worth checking out.

B00004X0Q0|5.0|This cd is the most amazing cd I have ever baught. This cd has not left my cd player once since I baught it which was 2 years ago. At the drive-in proves to us once again with this record that they are an extremely gifted band. I have not heard a band with a sound as complete as at the drive-in's. Cedric has a strong vocal sound, which allows them to do stuff that most bands wouldn't be able to pull off. Also having 2 guitar players allows them to have creative riffs that harmonize while most bands couldn't. <BR>  Relationship of Command has every element that is needed to make a great cd. It has catchy songs like &quot;pattern against user&quot;, it has the ballad which is &quot;non-zero possiblity&quot;, and it has the epic song &quot;invalid litter dept.&quot; Each song on the cd is relative to the last. How they did this was by making each song in the Key of G, thus each song is like a prelude to the next. <BR>Tracks 1-4 on the cd come at you at one thousand miles per hours(lyrically speaking), then the cd slows down with invalid litter dept. then with the hardest song &quot;manniquin republic&quot; shortly following which makes the perfect following. then it starts back at ground one with &quot;enfidel&quot; which is probably my most favorite song on the cd. then builds up momentum for the next 2 songs only to unleash the cd's climax with the song &quot;cosmonaut.&quot; which would be a great ending for the cd. but at the drive-in out does themselves again by ending it with another track. &quot;non-zero possiblity.&quot; With its beautiful melodies and its erie lyrics is the perfect ending for my favorite cd of all time.
B000002KHY|4.0|I am not a fan of compilations. However, I am a fan of James Taylor, so when I came across this on vinyl for ... I couldn't resist. Upon listening, I found it to be the perfect album for me, someone who really likes many of Taylor's songs and loves his voice, but is not an absolute, diehard fan. This CD has a perfect assortment of all the major songs, my favorites being \\"Carolina in my Mind,\\" \\"Fire and Rain,\\" \\"Sweet Baby James,\\" \\"Mexico,\\" and \\"Shower the People.\\" They're beautifully simple and melodic, made great by Taylor's understatedly stunning voice. <BR>     But let me get to the point. I know there are lots of absolute, positively reverential JT fans out there, and I am not quite among your ranks. (Though I respect you.)THE POINT? IF YOU ARE AMONG THOSE MEGA-FANS, DON'T BUY THIS. Phew, got that out there. Those people would do better to get all of JT's individual ones. It is, as the title suggests, ONLY his greatest hits.<BR>     All in all, I love this album as a nice survey of Taylor's most popular songs. For people like me, it is the perfect representaion of James Taylor in their record collections. However, decide for yourself if you really want this condensed version.
0060282983|5.0|I love this story so much, and so do my students. I think every child should read it. Also nice to add to your collection are: Aesop for Children (Winter), Grimm's complete fairy tales (Grimm), Great Children's stories (Richardson), The Butterfly (Singh). There are many other great children's books out there, but these were the ones I enjoyed the most. Oh, and I almost forgot: The Little Prince (Exupery).
B0000028M7|5.0|Ok; we gave Kurt Cobain his good-bye: now where's Layne Staley's? He was truly a great musician, and people will only begin to realize his influence when they look everywhere else in the world of rock (rock being mostly people with guitars, and a sense of art/ ie: indie/hardcore/prog/ experimental/ industrial). Look at Deftones, Godsmack,Our Lady Peace, Boy Hits Car, Sinch, Queens of the Stone Age: ALL influenced by this awesome band. Too many times is a band overshadowed by it's singer, so give due respect to the other memembers too. Long live AIC.

B00006V9A0|2.0|this is a Greatest Hits Album that still feels so Cheap&missing elements that I can't quite put into full Perspective.One New Song.Nirvana was a Band that while I wasn't crazy about there Albums on a WHole Fully weren't a Singles Act either.Kurt Cobain could really write Lyrics.but something about this Presentation seems like a Cheap Sell.they would be better served with a Box Set or something that fully tells&speaks of them than this Compilation.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This record is a huge mixture of sounds because of the time period it covers.  Comprised of tracks from throughout the band's history, the sampling of their different sounds over the years is impressive.  From the hard-hitting \\"Chic N' Stu\\" to the more thought-provoking \\"Streamline,\\" it is easy to find something you like here.  As a System fan, I saw the disc as a way to see their progression to where they are now, but any fan of rock will appreciate the overall sound of this record. <br />Another important part of the record's appeal is the underlying messages of System of a Down.  From the presentation of the case (no book included, CD is made to look like a CD-R that someone wrote on), to the title, \\"Steal This Album!,\\" to the politically motivated songs included, it is easy to see where the band stands on many issues (especially their anti-war stance).<br />Overall, \\"Steal This Album!\\" is definitely a record to own, if for many different reasons.  System fans should buy it because it is a chance to hear unreleased songs from the band's past.  Rock fans in general should buy it because it is a record with purpose that appeals to you no matter what style of \\"System\\" you prefer, hard-hitting or thought-provoking, and sometimes all of the above.  Get your hands on this one, even if you have to follow the band's cynical advice and \\"Steal This Album!\\"<br />Best tracks:  \\"Innervision,\\" \\"A.D.D.,\\" \\"I-E-A-I-A-I-O,\\" \\"Highway Song,\\" and \\"Streamline.\\"
B00006LFGD|4.0|I think this is a Good Set&Overview of Barbra Streisand&Her Duets over the years.the song with Barry Manilow was ok nothing special when Considering I think both of these Artists have made Much Better stuff over the years.so expectations were a bit High.but nevertheless the Material centers on Barbra Singing with others&how She Compliments Her Duet Partner.
B0000640VO|5.0|With its opening sequence of kalidescopic visuals and rapid-fire narration, viewers who do not speak French (myself included) are likely to find Jean-Pierre Jeunet's celebrated AMELIE a challenge, for it is rather difficult to watch the film and read the subtitles at the same time.  That said, once you are able to sycronize these elements in your head, you are in for a treat: AMELIE is simply one of the most charming films to emerge from France in many, many years.<br />Considering that the film is both foreign and subtitled, and therefore presumably has a somewhat limited appeal for English-only audiences, it's story has become remarkably well-known in a very short time among English-only audiences--a fact that attests to its power.  Amelie is a shy, somewhat reclusive young woman, the product of an emotionally distant father and profoundly neurotic mother, who hides from life as a waitress in a small cafe while cultivating &quot;small pleasures&quot;--skipping stones over water, dipping her hands into sacks of grain at the local market to feel the texture, and the like.  One day she discovers a box hidden behind the wall of her apartment bathroom, a tiny box filled with childhood toys stashed away by a long-ago childhood tenent.  She sets out to return them to the now-adult man who hid and forgot them so many years before... and when she sees his pleasure she finds a purpose in life: she will secretly do things to make others happier in their life, thereby vicariously living out the happiness she herself is afraid to accept.  In the process she not only brings life-changing joy to those around her, but she discovers her own need for happiness and the courage to change that she might experience happiness for herself.<br />The story is actually quite slight, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, his star Audrey Tautou, and a remarkable cast of supporting players give it tremendous style and an unexpectedly self-mocking sense of humor.  The film is full of visual metaphors: at various moments we see the hearts of different characters beating inside their bodies, Amelie fantasizes about hearing herself lectured by the television, the object of her affection is teased by talking photographs, and in one particularly memorable scene Amelie's disappointment is envisioned by morphing her body into a column of water that collapses with a splash to the ground.  The characters are mix of archetypes and glitchy eccentricity; the cinematography is shockingly beautiful; and everything about the film is gentle, sweetly funny, and sure to leave you with a Gallic smile and a wish that life were actually like that.<br />Tautou is a remarkable young actress who has been widely compared to both Audrey Hepburn and Leslie Caron--and indeed there is more than a passing similarity.  But she plays the title role with a knowing quality that belongs to her alone, and although the role (and indeed all roles in the film) is essentially archetypical her performance has a youthful grace slightly tempered by unexpected self-awareness: extremely effective and extremely endearing.  The film would be worth seeing for this performance alone, but fortunately AMELIE is remarkably rich in all its elements.<br />Those expecting &quot;depth&quot; may disappointed, for the life-lessons the films offers are not profound in themselves; others may find the film's odd mix of Brechtian distance, sly wit, and warmth a bit off-putting--and it would be easy to read the film as a somewhat diadactic comedy that doesn't entirely come off.  But if you can grasp the thought that the film isn't about anything beyond making you chuckle, smile, and rejoice in the small pleasures of life, you will find it extremely, extremely enjoyable.  The DVD comes with a second disk full of extras, including audition footage, outtakes, and the like that both cinephiles and Francophiles are sure enjoy.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I thought this was not a mini series it was not a movie it was a tribute to all vetrans especially those of Easy Company. Hanks,Spielberg, and Ambrose correctly portrayed these men and the battles they were involved in, this is truely a great &quot;film&quot;
B00006830P|5.0|Featuring six bonus tracks (Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?, I Want You, Changing Of The Guards, Blind Willie McTell, Tight Connection To My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love?), Dignity (Original Version)) this is obviously the superior version.<br />The haunting Blind Willie McTell, recorded in 1983, stands out better than anything else he did in that era.  The original version of Dignity is a much livelier mix than the one on Greatest Hits Vol 3. The snare and the lead guitar are now brought froward, which gives the song more of a groove, and everything sounds cleaner than the sludgy mix on the earlier version.
B00005JLSC|4.0|the litmus test of a musical is whether you remember the tunes days after you've seen the movie.  'chicago' doesn't pass the test.  i couldn't even recall one song one day after seeing this flic.  by coincidence, i'd watched 'my fair lady' the night before, and even now, almost a week later, i can still whistle the tunes in that classic.  so 'chicago' is a glitzy, energetic film and worth seeing.  but it doesn't stand up against the classics.
0375703764|1.0|HOUSE OF LEAVES has got to be one of THE most long winded, pretentious, geeky, pointless books I have ever attempted to read. I checked it out of my local library after reading all the rave reviews on the inside jacket of the book and after taking it home and attempting to read it, came to the conclusion that a) Either the people who love this plotless book come from another planet from the rest of us. b) People like me who read books to enjoy a good, entertaining story are not up to the pseudo-intellectual level of these nerds who can see brilliance in this doorstop/telephone book for ETs.<BR>I can't help wondering if Bret Easton Ellis was intoxicated when he gave his praise for HOUSE OF MANURE. But seriously, any guy who wrote AMERICAN PSYCHO with entire pointless chapters dedicated to Huey Lewis And The News et al must have toked a fair bit of the old waccy baccy into his lungs during his lifetime (though I loved GLAMORAMA and LESS THAN ZERO was pretty good).<BR>For you average people as a safety precaution when returning this book to the library, it would be a good idea to heavily bandage your hands so you don't graze your knuckles when they scrape along the pavement. Me always have that problem.

B00005O5CM|5.0|Legally Blonde is by far one of the funnier movies out there.  I never really saw previews for it, I just happened to see it at a friends house and fell in love with it.  I just rented it again last night on dvd, and the special features are great too.  If you are a fan of Reese's, I definately recommend this movie for you.  It shows you both her funny and serious sides.  <br />It starts out with Elle in a typical California college, parties and such, and she believes her boyfriend, Warner, is going to propose to her that night.  Instead he breaks up with her for someone more serious, if he is going to be a senator, he needs someone a bit more down to earth.  Elle is frustrated, and decides to apply to Harvard Law.  She somehow manages to get in, but she sticks out like a sore thumb.  Her first class doesn't go over too well, and she only finds out that Warner is engaged to some preppy girl.  She doesn't make friends very easily at first, and she starts to think law school was a bad idea.  Finally, she decides to prove everyone wrong, by getting her act together, and be prepared for her classes.  Everything is going great and when a teacher chooses 4 first years to help assist him, Elle is one of them.  As it turns out, their client was in Elle's sorority house, only before Elle was there.  Elle sets her heart out to win the case, and, well, I'll just let you watch the movie to find out the rest.
0553328255|5.0|I find that most &quot;Complete Collections&quot; tend to be presentation copies meant to look pretty on bookshelves rather than to be read.  Nothing wrong with this, unless you actually want to enjoy the stories.<br />This set of the complete Sherlock Holmes is a highly readable and portable collection.  The stories are split into two paperback novels, of the spinner-rack size, collected in a slim box.  The type is standard size, so there is no loss in cramming them all into these two volumes.  No frills here, just the stories.<br />As to the content, of course all of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes  tales are delicious.  I look forward to enjoying old favorites, and discovering new gems in this complete collection.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Some of the most beautiful acoustic guitar melodies I've heard in a long time. It's a definite departure from the typical Beck sound (if that's even definable) but the whole CD is an inspiring trip down a moody, wistful lane. Everybody's been there before, but Beck's blues are among the bluest.

B00000K19E|4.0|This movie really set the standard for special effects. There were a lot of movies that followed such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and many others that utilized the same technology. I'm sure I'll see the next Matrix movie that comes out, despite the fact that Keanu &quot;Ted&quot; Reeves is in it. Was someone joking when they told him he should be an actor? I've seen better actors in 3rd grade Christmas plays.
0066214122|3.0|...Mr. Crichton needs to write books, not screenplays. \\"Prey\\" begins with a lot of promise (compared to his last 2 dismal outings). Good and interesting characters, background information that helps the story instead to halting the flow and a very interesting mystery. Then, about halfway into the book, it suddenly becomes yet another standard Hollywood screenplay. The characters become flat and lifeless; every 5 minutes there is a new desperate chase scene (they didn't work in Jurassic Park II, they didn't work in Timeline, but whoever bought the movie rights wants it, so Michael writes it). The final battle and resolution is very empty and hollow and the motivations of the bad guys (see spoilers below) is completely lacking (but with plenty of room for a sequel Hollywood!). The science and characters are interesting the action and plot is pure tinsel town. <br />Mr. Crichton certainly has enough personal wealth these days that he should be able to stand up to his editors and publishers and write the book he wants to write instead of what will sell in Hollywood. The first half is a good as anything he has ever done, the second half is exactly the same anything he has done in the last 5 years. <br />I can't help but feel that he was pressured to publish this book before he had really worked out the details of the ending (see spoilers) and the weak ending undermines the great work done leading up to it. <br />...
B000001Y79|5.0|This cd, which richly deserved its diamond status, brought ska and No Doubt to the peak of popularity.  While the ska fever has died down, this album and band remain vital in the music scene.  This album is, for the most part, a happy affair.  Gwen Stefani is for this band what Christine McVie is for Fleetwood Mac, someone who can make bouncy songs even about depressing subjects.  Anyway, this album is fantastic.  The title track descends into a cacaphony of clashing instruments, and other tracks, such as &quot;Don't Speak,&quot; &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; &quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; and &quot;The Climb&quot; are also spectacular.  If you don't own this album now, what are you waiting for?  Buy it, listen to it, and love it.
B00005QATY|5.0|Don't take my word for it; read the other five-star reviews.  They cover just about all of my observations well and there's no need to repeat them. I am in my 70's and remember the great depression well. It was another world that this flick depicts accurately, albeit without all of the intense sorrow that also went with those hard times.  Judging from the automobiles and events depicted in this film it was set in 1938, give or take a year. It brought back many personal memories.<br />There really was a Governor &quot;pappy&quot; Lee O'daniel who was associated with a flour company and a country music group, but the real one was governor of Texas (not Mississippi) from 1939 through 1941, defeating Lyndon Johnson. I can still remember Lee O'Daniel's Light Crust Doughboys on the radio every evening.  The catch phrase in their bumper music was &quot;Please pass the biscuits, pappy.&quot; <br />Casting in the film was perfect. Many locals were undoubtedly used because no actor could depict the country characters so authentically. The music was as it really sounded back then.  It was refreshing to escape to the real thing without today's slick and professionally perfect plastic sounds. The songs were truly representative of the era, as I remember it.<br />This is a relaxing, refreshing, no-think film that works well on many levels. Every time you see it you see something you missed on previous viewings.  I completely missed its esoteric parody of Homer's Odyssey the first two times. <br />If you are in the mood for a fast moving, outrageosuly funny comedy that doesn't require delving into heavy, dark, brooding, depressing, and stressful psychological concepts, then this is the film for you. Even the manic-depressive behavior of &quot;Babyface&quot; Nelson was depicted in an hilarious manner.<br />This film consists of many sub-plots, all masterfully woven together into a coherent string, each serving as a vehicle for great comedy and wonderful country music as it was played, sung, and heard in the 1930's. I can't praise this film enough. It should have received many top awards, but we all know that awards are based on advertising budgets and Hollywood politics, not quality of the craft.<br />See this film once and you will want your own copy to view over and over again.  The kids will also love it.
1577311523|5.0|I agree that this book is wonderful -- helpful & enlightening. But I needed the companion workbook to figure it out, or \\"get it\\" one might say. So I recommend the workbook supplement, Practicing The Power Of Now, and also the practical psychology complement, The Positive Power Of Negative Thinking. These books help us learn to get in touch with the Power to feel better, be better, and live better. Spirituality and psychology, the positives and the negatives, are finally coming together Now, in mysterious union. As Jung might expect.
B00000K0E5|5.0|Pierce Brosnan's first venture as James Bond was his best. This movie was packed with action and humor. The funniest scenes were the scene where we first meet Natalya and Boris and the line where James is in Q's laboratory and picks up a large sub sandwich that he thinks is a gadget but Q grabs the sandwich and says, \\"Don't touch that! It's my lunch!\\" There was one joke the movie could have been left on the cutting room floor. In Q's laboratory, they're testing a phone booth with an airbag. It's kind of a running gag throughout the scene. The bag inflates pressing the technician against the glass. A few seconds later, the phone booth is carted off with the technician still trapped inside. It was a little stupid. <br />Famke Jensen had major sex appeal Xenia Zargevna Onatopp. In one scene, she and her lover (the fat guy with the beard)were having a very steamy scene together. She was in black underwear and he was naked. She was kissing him, jumping on him, and biting his chest hair. She was also growling and snarling like the sexy tiger she is. Of course, then, she strangled her lover with her thighs. She was very sexy and funny but I think that violence turns Xenia on because she was breathing very sexually after she killed everyone at Severnaya (is that how you spell it)?<br />Wade Baker and Valentin Zuvosky provided many laughs. For example, in one scene, Valentin was talking to Bond while his mistress, Irvina, was singing a country song (very badly I might add.)<br />Natalya was like all of those marked women in the Bond movies. This was a woman who saw something she shouldn't have seen or done something she shouldn't have done, like when Solitaire slept with Bond in \\"Live and Let Die.\\" Not only did Natalya provide some of the jokes for the movie but she provided the movie's most and only moving scene. After the base at Severnaya blew up, there is a scene where Natalya covers the body of her friend, Anna, who was killed along with everyone else. It was moving towatch because Natalya had not only survived an explosion, she had lost a very close friend.<br />Sean Bean was a very memorable villain. I have the hardest time placing him because I know he's in Lord of the Rings. I thought that there was a lack of a physical villain. Boris was more of a coward who only cared for himself. However, he did provide many funny lines. His recurring line, \\"I am invincible\\" had me saying, \\"You wanna bet\\" after he met his fate. <br />One of Bond's allies, Mishkin, was a very good character. However, it was a pity that he was shot after hearing the truth about the situation at Severnaya. Caroline Bliss breathes life into the role of Miss Moneypenny. She shows that Moneypenny doesn't look it, but she's desperately trying to get over James. Judi Dench should keep playing M for a long time. She's the best one since the original M, Bernard Lee (who I really got used too. I wasn't ready for a new M after Bernard Lee died.)<br />Is it just me or is this movie the first to talk about James' parents? Could someone mention that in a future review? Thanks. Rent this movie. It's one of the greatest Bond movies since Octopussy.
B00007E8V4|5.0|System of a Down and Toxicity rejects end up blowing them both out of the water, wow, I cant believe these were rejected from the albums, they all have massive potential and Id recommend people buy it and love it or...
B000006OS2|5.0|The story of a middle aged rancher who's wife has left him for reasons he doesn't know; who's only child, a beautiful daughter, has just graduated from college; who's rival, a pompus ..., has a large group of homesteaders heading for land that can't be farmed; who's old enemies, the local Indian Chiefs, are being released from Federal custody and he is trying to get a large shipment of cattle to market.  This movies is a tour de force with John Wayne and Mureen O'Hara giving us great comedy proformances.  The fight sence between Wayne and the homesteaders is a movie classic.<br />It is a must see!!!
B00005JL96|3.0|I watched this on a United flight while traveling on business.   I enjoyed it much more than I thought that I would.   However, I was glad that my two toddlers were not with me.   In typical Disney fashion, there were a lot of really scary parts.   Even more than usual, I think.   It was a well done movie.   I just wouldn't recommend it for young kids who are bothered by violence or suspense.   There was plenty of both.
B00005JL3A|1.0|I thought this movie was horrible.  I'm shocked that anyone has written a good review of it.<br />I love action movies.  I love movies based on video games.  I love to watch women kick [butt].  So I naturally thought I would enjoy this movie.  I was very, very wrong.  Don't waste your money.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I can't even begin to say enough good things about this movie.<br />For everyone familiar with THE LORD OF THE RINGS stories, I promise you will not be disappointed.  The entire fellowship are here and looking great! Gandalf is mysterious, and powerful, but his warmth and concern for his comrades shines through.  Aragorn is handsome and has a quiet appeal that can only be called a \\"presence\\" about him.  Gimli is kind of a lovable bully. Legolas is sprightly and intelligent. Frodo is the gentle hobbit that has to carry and bear the weight of evil. Sam, Merry and Pippin are just what I expected and Gollum could not have been better. The Orcs are a horrible and ugly group and worse looking than I ever pictured them.  Treebeard and the other Ents were a forest treat, and the beautiful elves were magical.  <br />The scenery was spectacular,and the actors chosen to portray the characters were true to the story and did terrific jobs in their roles. I was a little concerned that the movie might be too long for me, but that wasn't even a factor. The story moved so quickly that I wasn't ready for the film to end when it did.<br />I read these stories many years ago and was so surprised that I could enjoy them all over again.  Fantastic!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a review about the DVD.<br />Shrek is one of the best movies around.  The spoofs create an atmosphere of fun, remembrance of youth, and fantasy of kid stuff that makes for a great family experience.<br />The DVD extras make it worth the effort of buying a DVD player if you don't already own one (if only to hear the gingerbread man say continually, \\"Not my gumdrop buttons!\\")  The added bloopers of animation errors are hilarious!  The one of Farquaad with the invisible crown just about takes the cake for bad hair days!This movie gets a 5-star rating for superb attention to detail (the donkey extinguishing the fire), incredible use of fairy tale subplots, grossness that makes any kid (or adult) laugh uncontrollably, and DVD extras.
0316666343|5.0|just what this book was about.  I both laughed and cried at this lovely book.  In a rather remarkable way this is a heartwarming book written by Salman, a young teenager and her conversations and reflections and concerns about her family and, in particular, a friend made in an instant!<br />I guarantee that you will like this book...and it is a page-turner.
B000001DYD|4.0|Rock crudo y potente, musica de garage vanguardista en su tiempo ya que fue editado el 93 y es la onda musical que se escucha hoy en dia. Grande P J harvey, rid of me es un exelente disco, tiene un sonido como si lo hubieran grabado en su propia casa y en vivo, y eso le da cierto gustillo a rock puro, incluso se escucha la toz que le da antes de que pollie jean empieze a cantar en cierto tema. Tan solo guitarra, bajo, bateria y voz hacen de este disco uno de los mejores de los principios de los noventa, tambien incluye una seccion de cuerdas llamada \\"man size sextet\\" en el cual participa Harvey en voz e instrumentos de cuerda, la cual se repite esta misma \\"man size\\" en version rock ya mas avanzado el disco. Las mejores canciones para mi son \\"missed\\", \\"rub'til it bleeds\\", \\"me jane\\" y \\"ecstasy\\", aunque todas son muy buenas incluyendo el cover de Bob Dylan \\"highway '61 revisited\\". Si te gusta Nirvana, Mudhoney o incluso Sonic Youth te va a gustar \\"rid of me\\", es el disco para empezar a conocer a P J Harvey ya que los discos que vienen despues son rock mas alternativo y/o experimental, pero este del '93 es uno de los mejores del rock de principios de los '90. Lo otro que se me olvidaba era destacar la sensibilidad que tiene esta mujer para cantar, canciones realmente sufridas en cuanto a letras y gritos, que a final de cuentas, no te queda otra que creerle.
B00005JL96|5.0|i purchased this item for my three year old this christmas somewhat reluctantly as i did not find the trailers appealing, but since my daughter went on about it so much i gave in. iwas wrong , what an entertaining film. Both my 3 year old and 1 year old keep asking me to put it on again. in my opinion its as good as toy story, and monsters inc.
B00000DGUY|1.0|I was pleased with this collection, until I realized that the entire second verse of &quot;Money For Nothing&quot; had been edited out.  I assume that this was done so as not to offend sensitive ears with a derogatory term for male homosexuals, which was used as a shorthand device to make no doubt of the ignorance of the song's narrator.  And Knopfler has always maintained that the song came from an actual conversation that he overheard.  Too bad that irony is lost on the do-gooders, and that they have taken a song that makes a blistering point and have removed much of its power.  A complete disgrace.  Politically correct morons, 1, Rock and Roll, 0.  I sure hope these people never listen to &quot;Rednecks&quot; by Randy Newman.
B00007BHOE|5.0|i bought this the day it came out and must say it is the best pice of work and a dream come true.  there is not one thing to complain about on this dvd so keep dilivering roadrunner.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|Purchase this album and this is what you get: A good album with a few glaring weaknesses. However, tight tracks from the 18th letter (Rakim) and Gangstarr more than make up for the pop-tip tracks on this album. Don't pay attention to the 12 year olds that rate the album only for its eminem tracks, half of them are into Spongebob more than they are into classic hip hop. The Ra is coming!
B000067CPX|5.0|Ok, I admit it.  I'm too old for this: a scribe for kids born during the war ( WWII ) who listen to eclectic music.  I have some qualifications for this.  Saw Hendrix and Cream 4X each.  So bleepin' what?  Only that popular culture appeals to a vast range of tastes, and old folk can be set straight by youngsters, when the tykes in question are RHCP.  <BR>'By the Way' is my second foray into Chili Peppers' music.  I own 'Blood/Sugar' but it fails to draw me to it, not because of the lack of musicianship or bad song writing, more because I am not a funk/punk/metal fan of any real measure.  I bought 'Blood/Sugar 'cuz I heard it was good.  No comment.  But 'By the Way' is a work of art, well conceived and well realized.  <BR>Title track is two, two, two songs in one:  a funk-rap and a delicate, introspective, wistful ditty that celebrates its pop roots.  The line &quot;Dani the girl/is singing songs to me/under the marquee...of her soul&quot; is achy-tender.  It knocks me out.<BR>'Zephyr' sails on a silky guitar, a breeze that curls into the corner of your heart.  You can hear how much John Frusciante has listened to the Beach Boys throughout this album, the harmonies abounding with airy grace.  I loved this disc thru and thru.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I never expected System to top their last album, but I think they have.  They have such unique style in their music.  I can't explain how much I actually like this album.  It has very cool beats.  Beats that noone else uses.  I would recommend this album to all the system fans and to the people who are skeptical about buying this album.  I trust that you will like this album.  It is one of a kind.  My favorite songs are probably chic-n-stu because it's humorous and I-E-A-I-A-I-O is very original.
B00006CJOY|1.0|This album is a major disappointment. And let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Chau fan, I think that Proxima Estacion is one of the most exciting records made in years. <br />But this live album is awful. Reminded me of a caraoke bar in a French university, with impressionable teenage boys singing badly and impersonating reggae singers in the hope of attracting girls. I kept thinking the next track would be better, but one by one all of my favourites (Primavera, Mr Bobby, Clandestino etc), ruined, none of them a patch on the originals. All this albumn did for me was make me want to listen to the studio versions again, to purge for ever the nightmare of these renderings.<br />Few bands produce great live albumns. Invariably, the ones that disappoint most are the ones where the technical innovation / mixing etc of the studio albumns have been greatest (for example, going further back, the Pink Floyd and Roger Waters live albums were pale shadows of the originals, and revealed the sad truth that Roger can't actually sing). <br />Manu Chao need to get back to the recording studio asap, and produce more original brilliant sounds to atone for this crime against acoustics.

0767906543|5.0|Mr. Commitment is a gorgeous novel by Mike Gayle, it's protagonist is Duffy, a 28 year old man who reaches the dramatic moment of getting finally engaged whit his girlfriend. Duffy isn't enthusiastic at the idea of being committed and his girlfriend breaks up with him.You can find Duffy's story a common one, but the way it is told makes it a truly pleasant reading; the reader is pushed to read on by the desire of knowing how the book develops even if, in fact, is pretty intuitive. So what is the alchemy that forces the reader to read on? The answer is simple: the writing skills of M.Gayle,his ability at giving a vivid portrait of every day life.<BR>You find yourself (I'm referring especially to male readers) surprised when you discover how much you can identify with the protagonist.<BR>The people around the main character are also carefully characterized, and they provide a coloured &quot;cast&quot;.<BR>The result if this element mixture is a narration brilliant and well done as a comedian monologue; light and never boring, full of original and interesting inventions, sometimes sharp, always ironic.<BR>After so many &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; we finally have an absolutely rightful picture of mail psychology... because: who isn't Mr. Commitment?
B00005NMXI|5.0|An EXCELLENT introduction to Townes who, in my humble opinion, deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie. Beautifully illustrated with informative liner notes. My greatest thrill was discovering that Townes first efforts were produced by Jack Clement. My advice........buy this after you've read all the opinions and discover the joy and masterful poetry of the Texas Troubador, who we all deeply miss.
B00006674X|4.0|I caught this movie on American Movie Classics when they were having an Elvis movie marathon. I have to say this is one and very few GOOD Elvis movies.<br />In this movie, he's not some struggling musician with 40-year old women helping him along. I think if he wasn't a puppet with the strings being held by a certain manager, he could've made more movies like this one.<br />True, he does sing a little, but it's a hobby for his character. I don't think I can say any more than what the other reviewers have said, but take my word for it, this is one and very few good Elvis movies.
B000000OSE|5.0|Okay, okay, Axl sings like he caught his ... in a bear-trap, and he never quite creates a consistent music style in any of the GNR albums, but to say that this album, or any of GNR's other albums are anything less than excellent is just absurd.  Guns N' Roses has to be one of the most diverse and overall inspirational rock bands of this modern era (or any era you want to place them in).  This album, Use Your Illusion I, is without a doubt one of the most in-your-face hard-hitting rock albums of all time.  <BR>The thudding 6-string bass intro in Right Next Door to Hell (the opening track) really sets up the overall attitude and idea behind the first of the two Illusions.  Dust N' Bones, Live and Let Die (cover), Bad Obsession as well as Don't Damn Me really show just how talented and (well, messed in the head) GNR was. <BR>At first I thought that Use Your Illusion II was better, then I convinced myself it was Use Your Illusion I, but now I just have to make myself believe that they are equally great in their own way.  If you don't have this album, buy it and Use Your Illusion II at the same time, and you will see what I am talking about.<BR>Of course, like just about any other rock band in history, the followup albums aren't as good as the debut, in this case Appetite for Destruction being the original, but how can you blame them?  They tried, and that's going a much longer way than most bands you hear on the radio today.  Use Your Illusion I and II are definately in my top ten forever.
B00005IC2H|5.0|There are very few words that can explain this style of music to someone who has never heard it before. I became addicted to the sounds after I watched Vanilla Sky, I had to know who made that music. These people are amazing. I can't tell you how great it is, just take a risk, and you will see, you never know untill you try.<br />You won't regret it.
B00003CXRP|4.0|This is a very enjoyable movie, it's a little slow at times but rewarding if you stay with it.  However, since I've started watching DVD's, I've looked forward to the DVD commentaries.  This movie seems like a natural for a terrific commentary.  Unfortunately, the commentary isn't all that great - it's very technically oriented and the sound and camera operators make the same points over and over again.  One commentator spends several minutes listing who attended various pre-production meetings, another one goes into excruciating detail about sound looping.  Too bad, because there is a lot going on in this movie that could have been discussed at greater length.
B00006AFUR|1.0|my buddy tried to get me into these guys.. i tried.. even seen them live but the cd is too repetitive and they are horrible live.<br />stay away from this.
B000002LQR|5.0|In my opinion this is defintley their best album.<BR>Blood sugar sex magik is a masterpiece.<BR>I love every song on this album except for \\"My lovely man\\".<BR>This one I think is their landmark album,they really made<BR>it big when it came out.What more can I say ,it's one of<BR>their best album's they ever did.If you like the Chillie <BR>Pepper's you'll love this album.
0385508417|4.0|I read most of Grisham's books, so I couldn't past this one.  It's a very different style and it doesn't even seem to be written by him, but it's a good book nonetheless.  Light reading, funny and with a few twists in the middle.
B00005QZWI|5.0|To start off, this soundtrack is simply great. Howard Shore's amazing ability to create a heroic and yet touching score for such a wonderful movie is shown on this album. From his cheery piece Concerning Hobbits to the very moving Breaking of the Fellowship, Shore just lets the listener envision Middle Earth as it was written by Tolkien. Especially good were his pieces for when the Fellowship left Moria, and after Boromir's death. Also, as a fan of LOTR I can't listen to anything else while re-reading the story of Frodo and all.
0316666343|5.0|I was really touched by this story told by a murdered 14 year old from her venue in heaven. You have to stretch credibility for this premise, but once you get on board, it's a wonderful story. Susie Salmon narrates the story, interspersing the narrative about how she was raped and murdered, the search for her killer accompanied by how her killer is covering his tracks and a description of how her family copes with her loss. We also get a view of what a personalized heaven could be like--- since Susie was killed while in middle school, \\"her heaven\\" looks like the high school she never got to attend. She keeps close watch on both her family and the progress to find her killer.<br />The personal stories here are the stars: her father's desperate attempts to find evidence against the neighbor who he suspects killed Susie and his subsequent medical and mental breakdown, her mother's attempts to keep things going that collapsed completely and caused her to flee to California and her sister's take charge attitude with the baby brother, breaking into the neighbor's house to find evidence and making a life for herself. As you follow the lives of the main characters, you feel a connection with them. There are interesting ideas that spirits are all around us and some people can feel them more than others. Also interesting is the idea that spirits try to make their presence known to loved ones assuring them that they are all right.  We also see how Susie gets used to the idea that she is dead, what she misses, and how she yearns for her family.  The narrative covers a number of years and brings the story to what I think is a very satifying conclusion with lots of things to think about.<br />I think it is one of the best books of 2002. I read this as a library book then went out and bought my own personal copy. <br />Highly recommended.
B0000062Y2|5.0|Unlike previous reviews, I have to say that this version of JCS, is much better than the &quot;original cast&quot; version.  Ted Neely and Carl Anderson shine here.  Their performances are more emotional, more dynamic and more powerful than any other version I have heard to date.  I was disappointed when I got the &quot;original cast&quot; CD as a gift and went out and bought this one since I already had the DVD of the movie.  Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice have created some of the best &quot;rock-opera/musical&quot; songs to date.  There's no doubt the music is dated to the early 70's, but that's the fun of it.  A must have for any musical fan.
0066214122|3.0|Frank Herbert did this plot a lot better 30 years ago in a novel called &quot;The Green Brain&quot;. A decent read, but as predictable as all Crichton's novels.
B00006CXSS|5.0|this is probably the best screen presentation of g.i.s in world war two ever made.  the authenticity of the equipment, the uniforms and the fact that the actors actually sounded and acted like my father and uncles ( all veterans of ww II ) truly made this the best.  the book itself is wonderful and perfectly represented in this series.  we all owe steven ambrose a great deal of thanks for insisting they &quot; get it right&quot;, and of course we owe the men who sacrificed so much to save us.  the debt we owe them can never be repaid, ever!
0345350499|5.0|I loved this book. Even though it took me eight months to finish, I thought it was just amazing. Why didn't anyone think of writing the Arthurian legend from a woman's point of view? Fabulous! I recommend this to anyone interested in Aruthurian legends, fantasy, and paganism!
0553573403|2.0|It's &quot;Dallas&quot; meets &quot;Fantasy Epic&quot;.  Martin is a better fantasy writer than most, but sadly this book is no masterpiece.  He touches on an interesting story, but gets bogged down in the soap opera in which his main characters are playing.<br />If you are more interested in interpersonal relationships than a gripping story then this book will sit well with you.<br />If you are looking for a good fantasy yarn, then keep looking.  This is fantasy for those who like &quot;he said, she said&quot; stories.
B00005JLRR|4.0|My thoughts about Nemesis when I left the theatre was of being unfullfilled by what happened in the film. It was a good idea I thought to use the Romulans and Remans. Using the controversy of cloning as a theme of the movie was a good idea. The special effects were good. But what bothered me were the things that were not in the movie. Having read the novel before I went in to see the movie may have been a bad idea, but it also let me know some of the things that were removed from the movie. I understand about 40 minutes were cut from the film and much of it was things the fans would have liked. I highly recommend to the powers that be at Paramount that they reinsert the missing pieces in the DVD to satisfy the fans. I also thought Data's death was unnecessary. It would perhaps have been much more interesting to see how Data would have handled becoming first officer of the Enterprise, seeing how his interactions with Picard and B4 would change due to his promotion and becoming B4's mentor. One omission that perturbed me was when in the middle of the battle the Enterprise ran out of photon torpedoes, but nobody mentioned anything about the quantum torpedoes. Also, what kind of ship was the Titan? Was Riker getting a Sovereign,  Galaxy or Prometheus class ship to command or an old rust bucket?<BR>Personally, I'm hoping it's a Prometheus class. One thing neither the book nor the movie addressed is what is Wesley doing back in the picture. These are fan items of interest that the fans would have liked to know, and I suspect the 40 minutes of additional footage would have answered at least some of these questions. Nemesis was good, but could have been so much better.
B00006NSZ5|3.0|Eminem writes catch songs.  Despite the cussing the music is pretty normal and fun to listen to.  People make him out to be extreme but he isn't any more out there than any other Pop star out there.  Heck, the guy is a Dad in his mid 30's!  So don't worry.  If you buy this CD you will enjoy it.  I know plenty of people in there 40's who listen to Eminem.  This CD is fun!

B00005JKZT|3.0|The Two Towers is a good film with excellent scenery, actors, music, and special effects.  However, I was disapointed with the interesting choices Peter Jackson made regarding what parts of the book to include.  The director apparently decided to cut out chunks of the book to make room for completely made-up scenes.  In one instance, a character's attitude and actions were completely reversed (!!!).  And for the parts that were originally from the book, many were altered.  <BR>So if you plan on seeing this and have never read the books and don't plan on ever reading them, it's a great movie.  But if you love Tolkien's work, the two towers is still good, just be prepared for the numerous changes.
0316666343|1.0|This week's (1/16/03) New York Review of Books has an excellent article as to why this book is so popular: some post-9/11 need for simplistic healing and soothing fantasy about life after death. <BR>Sebold is more of a poet than a fiction writer. That is, she's adept at spinning pretty images, rather than showing us the paces of a plot. The characters are cardboard cutouts, and by the time the \\"dead\\" narrator slips inside the body of her old schoolchum, I knew we'd entered rock-song teen fantasy.
0553208845|5.0|This is a great book portraying the search of a young Indian's search to find man's role on the earth. Siddhartha, a young Indian from a pious and spiritual family gets his initial training in Vedic culture and meditation. His interest to find the ultimate goal of man on the earth makes him a seeker of truth. He soon finds that the Vedic ceremonies and meditation practices he is following is taking him or any of the followers to any heights. He prefers to become a Samana to find the truth. Govinda, his friend and companion all the time also follows him and both becomes Samanas to wander in the forest in the path of self denial teaching their bodies to grow indifferent to pleasures and pains. Siddhartha finds that this path is also not guiding him towards ultimate goal. During this phase both Siddhartha and Govinda hears about Gotma Buddha, the illustrious one who found his way to the ultimate goal. The journey of Samanas takes them to Jatavana where Gotama, the illustrious one together with his disciples stays. On hearing the discourse of Gotma, the illustrious one, Siddhartha feels that the path to ultimate goal is not even here.  He questions Gotma, the illustrious one's teachings. Siddhartha feels that no one can teach the path to the ultimate goal because everyone has to find his own way. He still continues his quest and tries his way in the worldly affairs. He finds kamala and become a rich merchant. He gets a son. Even this life could not satisfy Siddhartha's quest. He continuous his journey and finally finds his path at the river where he hear the voice of the river. He settles down there to start a new life of peace and finally he understands that love is the most important thing in the world.<br />The journey of Siddhartha seeking the truth was brilliantly portrayed by Hermann Hesse who himself suffered religious crisis during his earlier days. The explanation of Siddhartha as a son of Brahman gives us the account of the seeker. The changes in his life seeking the truth had been characterized by discussions with Govinda as a Son of Brahman in the beginning and as a Samana later, his discussion with Gotama, the illustrious one and then his dream at the river where, his return to the river and last discussion with Govinda portrays the journey of Siddhartha brilliantly.<br />I read this book long back and wanted to revisit it during the new year. I found this book still in the best seller's rack in a book store in Hyderabad, India and felt that it should be in the bestsellers rack across the world for the years to come. A must read for all those who wish to tread the path of thinking and seeking the truth.g the truth had been characterized by discussions with Govinda as a Son of Brahman in the beginning and as a Samana later, his discussion with Gotama, the illustrious one and then his dream at the river where, his return to the river and last discussion with Govinda portrays the journey of Siddhartha brilliantly. <BR>I read this book long back and wanted to revisit it during the new year.

6304288433|3.0|And he seem to be even more relentless in this film. Rating this video is a little hard, yet easy. Hard in the fact that I like it and shouldn't, and easy because it so easy to slam. In the easy to slam catergory, it doesn't in any way stand up to the original. Rick Rosenthal's direction is not on par with Carpenter's. The Michael Myers figure just seems like a killing machine without any motivation. I could go on with so many other reasons on why this movie shouldn't have worked for me, but I only have so much space. I guess the only reason that it does work for me on any level is because of the presense of Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence. They make what have been unwatchable in the hands of other actors bearable.
B000002J1S|1.0|for me, there's better. We've all heard a million times how \\"Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" is the high-point of all 70s prog-rock along with \\"Close To The Edge\\" by Yes. Millions of people have bought the albums & listened to them hundreds of times since the early '70s. Now, if you want to hear a virtually unknown 1972 album that tops them both click over to ALAN SORRENTI \\"Aria.\\" Buy that without any hesitation whatsoever & be blown away. That to me is hands-down the greatest prog. album ever made even though it's in Italian & I don't understand any of the lyrics.<br />Lamb Leaps Down represents the high-point of all rock drumming, Collins one-upping Bruford at his own game. There are far more technical rock drummers for sure, guys like Terry Bozzio or Vinnie Colaiuta who can play stuff Collins couldn't even dream of, but none with the clever finesse & sensitivity to nuances that Phil has. Also, credit has to go to the most underrated prog bass player of all Mike Rutherford. The intense polyrhythms over odd-meters laid down by the rhythm section of Collins-Rutherford is what makes LLD stand up to so many repeat listens, not the fancy Jungian Peter Gabriel concept. These are the best overall Collins drum parts if you listen closely on headbphones, but not the flashiest. To hear the flashiest Phil Collins drum display, Phil thowing himself around the drums like a maniac & really bashing them skins to death, you'll have to pick up \\"Unorthodox Behavior\\" by Brand-X.
B00006LHYC|5.0|In this new production, we see a fully realized woman with a child's heart... some of her songs remind me of those wonderful 80s when music came from the the inside, when lyrics were pure and simple, yet beautiful and enchanting.<BR>You don't need to be a fan of hers, you don't need to know her music, if you like good lyrics and pop music, this is for you!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|WOW!! I got this CD for X-mas, and out of my punk rock collection of Minor Threat, The Casualties, The Ramones, Green Day, Sex Pistols, Rancid, Operation Ivy, Crass, and other stuff, this is probably the greateset out of all of them.  I find myself listening to it constantly.  Its the first Clash Cd ive owned.  One track I'd really like to point out is Spanish Bombs. WOW THIS SONG IS GOOD!! BUY THIS CD!!
B00007E8V4|5.0|When i was told of SOADS new release i couldnt wait! Being a massive soad fan for years now i was not dissapointed! From the opening song \\"chick \\"n\\" stu\\" you just know that this will be a classic! Serj has injected a strong armenian influence into a majority of the songs on this album and it does make the difference! Also Malakian plays a more vocal role in this album, as well as playing harmonic and punchy guitar riffs. However, for a first time SOAD listener, i dont recommend steal this album. This is because of the fact that these songs are essentially outtakes of TOXICITY. Thus, Many listeners might not like the songs. This album is essentially for \\"experienced\\" fans!!For first-time listeners, i recommend Toxicity
0802130208|5.0|Ignatius J. Reilly is a corpulent thirty-year-old who lives with his mother in New Orleans. He deems himself the intellectual master of nearly all those with whom he comes in contact. He has no job as the story commences, but is coerced into finding work by his fed-up mother. The zaniness that follows can only be appreciated first-hand, so further attempt at a depiction of the plot line is neither necessary nor actually possible.<br />John Kennedy Toole demonstrates a touch of genius in this indescribable satire, a genius that never got a chance to flower, as he was already dead when this book was published. His social commentary, although almost always hilarious, carries an undercurrent of despair. The multiple sub-plots and the incredible cast of characters give this novel such a rich and layered texture that a re-reading (or two or three) is almost a must. Truly one of the most unique books I've ever read.
B000079B0A|5.0|KYLIE IS THE BEST ARTIST OUT THERE, I GREW UP WITH HER MUSIC, SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.  AND WITH EVERY CD I FEEL A CONNECTION,  I AM SO HAPPY KYLIE IS IN THE STATES NOW, BEFORE A FEW YEARS  I HAD TO SPECIAL ORDER EVERYHTING ABOUT HER.  SO IF YOU LOVE LIFESTORY SONGS WITH GOOD BEAT AND JUST WANNAT GET UP AND DANCE, LIKE GLORIA GAYNOR MEETS THE NEW MUSIC STYLE, THEN GET ALL OF KYLIE'S CD'S.  THEY ARE ALL ANTHEMS OF THE ERA.
B00005NRO3|4.0|Scream 2 saw an improvement to the series because the body count was 3 times as high than the first, there were some twists and turns and an all star cast doesn't hurt either.<br />Sidney's back and this time she's in college and when a couple of her classmates are killed at the movie premiere of her story (Stab). At first everyone thinks that it was just one of those things and as it turns out, the murders are related and now it's up to Sidney to survive and Randy, Gail and Dewey to find the killer. <br />I actually liked Scream 2 the most out of all 3 just because it was a little more intense and a little more personal than the first (as far as the murders go, not as much hack and slashing). The soundtrack was also significantly better from the first. <br />The thing that bothered me was the twists and turns at the end. I can't give it away but it's a really lame twist at the end. I won't deny that it is a surprise at the end but it's still kind of lame. And again, my same complaint that I had with the first, the men that are stalked are wussies and they die with ease but the chicks seem to handle the killer before getting cut down. <br />Make sure to watch Scream first otherwise there are going to be A LOT of things that won't make sense. Also, check out URBAN LEGENDS and FINAL DESTINATION as well. Another 2 great titles.
B00003CY6M|5.0|This, I would have to say, is my favorite movie of all time! This is the kind of movie that you walk away from feeling inspired, happy, and wanting to live life to the fullest. The storyline is captivating, the acting is near perfect, cinematography and directing is inspirational and beautiful, and the thing that makes this movie so great (in my opinion) is the music. Every note of music is perfectly chosen and executed. <br />So the storyline is about two people that meet by accident, spend a little time with each other, but then go their different ways. A few years later, they're about to become married to different people but can't forget each other and go on a search for each other. Then it is by fate and chance that they meet once again. <br />This movie is amazingly beautiful in all aspects and I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to spend one and a half hours being taken away on a dream-like ride of love, life, and coinsidences. I would also recommend the amazing soundtrack.
6305014140|5.0|Ninja Scroll is one of my all time favorite animes ever. It's got great animation, awesome fight scenes and some totally wicked characters as well.<br />I gotta admit it, at the time this was released I hadn't seen any other animes that impressed me nearly as much as this one did (aside from the obvious AKIRA and later on that year GHOST IN THE SHELL). The story line is great as well. It keeps you intrigued throughout the entire film and it also has some really good twists and turns.<br />The fight scenes are amazing! They're extremely fluid and fast and there are so many really, really good one in this film. I can't say there isn't one I didn't like (my favorits fight scene, Jubei vs Utsutsu Mojuro, the blind man). Now as usual with most Animes, this one is not for younger viewers at all for a few reasons like the incredible amount of violence, nudity, swearing, sexual content and a rape scenes (involving Kagero, the female Ninja). Granted yes the rape scenea really wasn't too bad but still it was there (but again nothing like LEGEND OF THE OVERFIEND type of rape scene).<br />This is a highly recommended MUST CHECK OUT! All Anime fans will get into this one, all fantasy and role play lovers will like this one and of course the martial arts fans will drool over this one as well. I also mentioned some other Animes as well that you should check out (AKIRA, GHOST IN THE SHELL and even LEGEND OF THE OVERFIEND if you're old enough for it because it's really dirty). In any case, you'll love NINJA SCROLL I guarantee it!
B00005QFF1|4.0|This is one of the better Chinese movies in that it actually has a plot! Most of the older Chinese-made movies are borderline in this aspect. Zhang Ziyi is a refreshing change from Gong Li, who can't act her way out of a paper bag! (My Chinese friends agree with me on this!) This movie provides an excellent portrait of a rural Chinese village, even down to the dishes they use. What I liked is how clearly the characters enunciated, so even if you have basic/minimum Mandarin, you can follow the dialogue much of the time without using subtitles. Language is the one flaw the movie has, as rural villagers would have spoken in dialect and not Mandarin, the national language. While this wasn't as great as &quot;Crouching Dragon, HIdden Tiger,&quot; it is a good movie and a great way to while away a couple of hours.
078322687X|4.0|Out of all of the BRAT PACK movies, this was one of my favorites. The Breakfast Club is about 5 kids (an athlete, a princess, a nerd, a basket case and a criminal) who are stuck wasting a Saturday for their various reasons. In one Saturday, they all learn something new from each other and also learn a little about themselves.<br />O.k. first and foremost, the premis of this movie is kinda off (i.e. why are 5 kids actually showing up to Saturday detention?) but if you look past that little part, the rest of the movie is funny as hell. There's just a ton of laughs in this from wise cracks to even some pretty good physical comedy and even a smoking pot scene that's really funny.<br />I took off a star because Molly Ringwald's character (Claire) is a bit on the annoying side but at least, Judd Nelson is harsh in this movie! And of course Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall and Ally Sheedy weren't bad either.<br />This is a great hang out film and it's also a bit mooshy at the end for any romantics. Check this one out and also check out FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH.
0446530573|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I bought it this afternoon and read it by this evening. I love it for the following reasons: 1. The recipes are authentic & outstanding. I learned to cook in a Culinary Institute internship kitchen, and I know good when I see/taste it. Having spent lots of time in old country Southern Italian families, I know what's real. Take for instance, \\"spaghetti sauce\\". This book differentiates between simple Marinara, and \\"Sunday Gravy\\". You learn about Sunday Gravy from little old ladies in black who live to cook for the familia. And... how many non Italians know how to choose a wine like \\"Lacrima Christi\\"??? 2. The interviews and conversations, by the letter of the Law are fictitious... but so well done that they fulfil the spirit of the intended conversations. I'll attest to that from years of experience in the Italian-American world and as a retired homicide detective. From my present vocation as a Priest, I'll give this comment: \\"Nonne dulce est familiam totam in unem locum cogere\\"? (Isn't it great to have the whole family together?)<br />My advice: BUY THIS BOOK !!!<br />Fr. Bob Haux
0345423496|3.0|After 2061 I almost passed on reading this one except I already owned a copy so I figured it couldn't get any worse than the last one.  Fortunately I was right, barely.  The initial premise is cool that Frank Poole could be revived after all these years but then the story delves into predictions of the future that are nowhere near as plausible as the predictions in 2001.  To have come this far and make this the last book is the series it would have been nice to have answered some of the questions raised by the first two books.  While 2061 looked like there was little else there besides the reputation of the first two books at least this book starts with an interesting premise.
B0000074CU|5.0|For me this disc along with \\"Live Taste\\" is the high point of the late Rory Gallagher's recorded work and also sets the view that Rory Gallagher was taste on it's ear.Throughout this set the rhythm section of McCracken and Wilson support ,cajole and at times threaten to upstage one of the best blues guitarists ever to set foot on a stage. This is a no holds barred blues rage from start to finish, these guys play with a passion and commitment that no longer seems to exist in rock music.I have no idea who followed them onstage at the Isle of Wight, but I bet they took a long time to set up,this was no easy act to follow.Another reviewer has described this set as incendiary and I couldn't agree more. <BR>The sound quality on this disc is fairly ordinary(mine came with a sticker claiming it had been re-mastered)but I still have to give it 5 stars.If it's the blues you want...look no further.
0451457994|5.0|I finally read this book years after having seen the movie.  I wish I had read it sooner.  I think this book blows the movie away.  Sure the movie was pioneering for its time and is timeless but the book is not as abstract as the movie.  If you take the movie and make it as clear as crystal, and slightly more enjoyable, you've just read the book.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I am so excited that DS9 is being released on dvd.  I have been looking forward to this ever since they started releasing TNG.  I have to agree with everyone else who believe DS9 is the best of the Treks.  The character development, acting, and stories beat any other Trek easily.<br />Like most first seasons, this one is not as good as subsequent seasons, but that's understandable and forgivable.  Yet, the brilliantly written and acted episode \\"Duet\\" gave a foretaste of the excellence to come.<br />One of the best things about DS9 is how the characters develop over the seasons.  Most notable is the relationship between Miles O'Brien and Dr. Bashir which grows from that of dislike to best friends.  But all of the characters were wonderfully portrayed and developed.  My favorite recurring characters were Garak the spy/tailor and Vic Fontaine (you won't see Vic in the first season).<br />Buy this dvd to see the finest Trek ever produced.
0783113943|5.0|Angelinia Jolie is a great actress with terrible taste in choosing films. Her dreadful &quot;Life or Something Like It&quot; is godawful. As an antidote, &quot;Gia&quot; shows Jolie's acting ability, and is a gritty, sensual and brilliantly tragic movie. Jolie plays Gia, based on a real model. If you don't like &quot;She dies, the end,&quot; films, this will be way too sad. If you like looking at lives that are way weirder than yours, this is a great movie. In any case, in this movie you can't take your eyes off Jolie.
B00005V1B1|3.0|Camel is a second-tier progressive rock band, built around Andy Latimer's guitar and flute, and (in the early days) Pete Bardens' keyboards. They'll never make you forget Genesis or Yes, and they don't \\"rock out\\" much, but they have a way with melody, texture, and mood.<br />This 1974 album, their second, is never less than pleasant but never compelling. Three songs have brief vocal segments, but the album is mostly instrumental. The first two songs are the weakest of the five pieces here. \\"Freefall\\" is generic 70s prog-rock, except for some Allman-esque guitar harmonies in the middle segment. \\"Supertwister\\" is a slight instrumental that plays with a 5/8 riff and gives Latimer a flute workout. \\"The White Rider\\" suite, a tribute to Tolkien's Gandalf character, is entertaining except for a marching band interlude near the start. \\"Earthrise\\" is the catchiest piece on the album, an instrumental that gives Bardens a chance to shine. \\"Lady Fantasy\\" is a 12-minute epic, the showpiece of the album, and gives you an idea why there are some diehard Camel fans. For whatever reason, the last movement of the song sounds just like Caravan, especially Bardens' organ solo (Caravan's Sinclair cousins later served stints in Camel). Overall, this is about as good as an album can be without getting a \\"very good\\" ranking, and that's because the peaks just aren't high enough. There are AT LEAST six cuts on \\"The Snow Goose\\" (and even three on \\"Nude\\") that I like better than anything on \\"Mirage\\".  I haven't heard the extra tracks that are on this version of the album.<br />(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)
0312305060|2.0|The book is beautifully written.  Cunningham is clearly an outstanding writer.  But the subject matter of the book is cold and as I was reading it, I kept thinking to myself - &quot;who cares?&quot;  I never developed even the slightest empathy for the characters, whose lives I found totally uninspired.

B00006V9A0|5.0|If you are a Nirvana fan you must get this album. If you are a fan of alternative, punk, grunge, or rock music, you nust get this album. Every single one of these songs on this album are fascinating. It is one of those C.D.'s where you just can't skip a track. \\"About A Girl\\" is a fast pace song that is off Nirvana's second album. If you like the Beatles' you are sure to like this somg. \\"Been a Son\\" is similar to \\"About a Girl\\". It is fast paced and has a nicebeat to it. \\"Sliver\\" is a great song with a very cool bass intro. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is a really great song. It is an anthem for teenagers around the world today. \\"Come As You Are\\" is also a great song. It has a nice beat and the \\"memoria\\" chants are really soothing. \\"Lithium\\" is a really cool song. It has a nice guitar and bass rythym to it and the words are really catchy. \\"In Bloom\\" is a really great song. Kurt's voice is really great in this song. The drums are magnificent. \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is also a great song. When you first hear the song you think you are going to hear a really slow paced song untill the chorus comes in. This song has a great guitar intro and solo. The drums are remarkable. \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is another song that is just great. It is different from the version heard in IN UTERO. The drums and guitar in tis song are just WOW. \\"Rape Me\\" is a really cool song. It has a great guitar and awesome backing vocals by Dave Grohl in the final \\"rape me\\" chants. \\"Dumb\\" is sord of a stoner song but it is still realy cool. The bass is really good. The final two song's on this album are live from when Nirvana appeared on MTV Unplugged. \\"All Apologies\\" has a really great bass riff and a nice ending vocal riff. \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" is a David Bowie song that the band covered. The intro guitar and solo are breathtaking. They are just great. The first track on this album is \\"You Know You're Right\\". This track is a new track which had never been released. It is a little scary to hear those \\"pain\\" chants from Kurt towards the end and especially the last one. The guitar is great and the drums are just beaten down hard by Dave Grohl. So go buy this album now. It is great. VIVA NIRVANA!
B00001SIES|5.0|This is one of the best cd's I have ever bought. From beginning to end, Showbiz is an album that just cannot dissapoint. Songs like &quot;Showbiz&quot; and &quot;Sunburn&quot;start quiet and slowly build and build until they explode into what can only be described as sonic bliss. If you like this album, you will love Origin of Symmetry as well.
B000000WJZ|5.0|To me, \\"Siamese Dream\\" is the Smashing Pumpkins strongest album. While \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinate Sadness\\" sold millions of copies with it's 2 disc set, this normal 1 disc is a very good look at what great alternitave music was--and I quote \\"was\\". Alternitive bands these days are good. Don't get me wrong. I personally think we should have more alternitave music than this pop-punk garbage. But the problem is the alternitave bands these days don't bring as much spirit into the songs anymore as much as The Smashing Pumpkins did. The Smashing Pumpkins were able to take any guitar riff, any drum beat, or any vocal tune and turn it into an unblievable song. Billy Corgan is one of the greatest singers I have ever heard. He really puts a lot into his vocal quality. This CD is a blend of lots of hard alternitave music with some great ballads. My favorite songs on here would definatly be \\"Cherub Rock\\", \\"Today\\", and of course possibly the greates alternitave ballad ever \\"Mayonaise\\". This CD is a great look at what alternitave was and what it should always be like. This album will never get old.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is amazing!  With her famous pop-rock songs \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Sk8er Boi\\" and others which are definately as good and some that are better (unwanted) this CD is a must have.. GO CANADA!!!
B000002LQR|5.0|This album was, and still is, a surprise to any mainstream music listener.  I'll say right now that I got into the RHCP with Californication, but I have nothing but respect for this album.  Quite frankly, I expected a much more souldful, slow reecord when I bought BSSM, so you can probbabley guess I was surprised.  At first I was dissapointed.  I thought that with Californication I had found a good, thoughtful band that I could mourn or meditate to.  I had no idea that they would end up being a band I could dance and head-bang to as well.  This whole album is great.  Sadly, I have never hence found another band with the same distinct funk/metal/electric sound as the RHCP.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I was hooked on t.A.T.u. ever sense I first heard their catchy single &quot;All The Things She Said&quot;. Their CD is a new, refreshing blend of pop and techno delicately crafted around their innocent voices. This record could easily be labeled as senseless bubble gum pop, if it wasn't for the true sincerity that comes across in the duo's singing. Every Track on this CD is worth listening to. The only bad thing is that you end up craving for more of their infectious music at the conclusion of the record. At least their video is featured in the enhanced version of the CD. The scenes of the two showing their love towards one another against all odds is enough of a reason for anyone to get this CD. It's about time we see something new arrive in our states.
B000002MUQ|5.0|This multi-platinum album was released at a bad time for classic rock music. In 1995, grunge type bands were still on top. \\"Balance\\" however is in no way at all a sell-out sound for Van Halen. They stick to their guns on this one and I feel that it is their \\"heaviest\\" sounding album to date.(at least on par with the F.U.C.K album) It has a very heavy/full sound with some scorching vocals from Sammy Hagar. Edward Van Halen has a certain tone to his playing that, is unheard on any of their previous albums. All I can say is that it is just awesome to hear and sounds better the louder you play it!! This album is full of killer tunes that you may not know well because of the album's release date.
B00005JLD2|5.0|In RABBIT-PROOF FENCE, it's early 1930s Australia and A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) is the government pencil-pusher empowered to \\"protect\\" the native aboriginals, part of which policy is to forcibly remove half-caste children from their native homes and send them to special schools where they can be \\"improved\\" by the ways and language of the whites. Rather than being a cruel or bad man, Neville is a well-intentioned and paternalistic bureaucrat whose working theory of racial superiority is at the benevolent end of the spectrum, the other end being the extermination camps of Hitler's Third Reich. As Neville puts it, \\"The native must be helped in spite of himself.\\"<br />Three children abducted from their home under this program are Molly (14), her sister Daisy (8), and cousin Gracie (10). They're transported to a school 1,200 miles away. Very soon after arriving, Molly decides to escape and walk back home. She convinces Daisy and Gracie to accompany her. The trek back is along the RABBIT-PROOF FENCE, a wire mesh barrier thousands of miles long stretching from the north to southern coasts of Western Australia, and which was designed to keep wild rabbits from devastating the crop lands.<br />The three aboriginal children who play the roles of Molly, Daisy and Gracie (Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, and Laura Monaghan respectively) are untrained actors, but you wouldn't know it by the performances they give. Molly is especially impressive as the one whose strength must keep her companions moving forward on the long march, as well as provide the cunning and skill to avoid both the roving constables on the lookout and the old aboriginal tracker, Moodoo (David Gulpilil), used by the school to hunt down runaways.<br />RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is based on a true story, a fact brought home to the audience by the film's last scene.  It's an amazing and moving tribute to the pluck of three children determined to foil the foolish and insensitive policy of a misguided government. This film is not, and probably won't ever be, in wide release. Do yourself a favor and seek it out - and take the kids.s film is not, and probably won't ever be, in wide release.

B000060K4O|5.0|&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is a big hit at the box office in 1984 and it is one of the best DVDs I own. Three scientists (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis) get out of university and decided to set up the shop in the firehouse to become Ghostbusters to trap ghosts for money. If you own a DVD player, you must own this excellent DVD. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B00005U1YO|5.0|The Chems carry on with their rave inspired sound from Surrender. No bombast like on Dig Your Own Hole. &quot;Star Guitar&quot; has a warm guitar that makes me dream of dancing on a beach as the sun goes down. &quot;Denmark&quot; smokes as a hip-shaking tune. &quot;The Test&quot; mesmerizes with Richard Ashcroft singing and a psychedelic dynamic.

B00005JKJA|4.0|A group of my friends rented this to pass the time one night, and we ended up being made rather uneasy by the whole thing. We had to stop the movie halfway through to discuss and try to understand what had happened, who was who, and exactly what was really going on. We finished it out, and sat there for about half an hour, stunned by how complexity of the way the ideas had been presented<br />While it may not be the most easily understood movie ever, it's entrancing. The visuals are stunning. Definitely worth the watch, even though you may be up all night trying to figure out every nuance of the film.
B000002GYW|5.0|Establishing a specialized sound on their first album, the Eagles set out here to create a concept album paralleling their own lives as a rock band to that of a desperate cowboy outlaw. Anything and everything that the Eagles were about is contained on this one album while still enlisting all of the original members. <BR>  Of course there are the hits like the much covered and well-written `Desperado' about reaching a crossroads in life and the two-timing country ballad `Tequila Sunrise'. But there are truly amazing album tracks here as well. The pretty ballad `Whatever Happened To Saturday Night?' contains a baroque interplay between the mandolin and piano in the instrumental break that is unique and effective while `Doolin' Dalton' continues the ballads in similar fashion to `Desperado'. 'Bitter Creek' is hauntingly scarey track about wrestling demons.<BR>  There are great rockers like `Out Of Control' and the single that bubbled under the charts `Outlaw Man.' The album closes in neat concept album fashion with `Doolin' Dalton'/'Desperado' medley.<BR>  Don Henley, Bernie Leaden, Timothy B. Schmidt, Glenn Frey and J.D Souther should all be applauded for a job well done. They created their ultimate statement on their second outing. \\"Desperado\\" is the album I would pick of all if you could only have one Eagles album.
0385508417|5.0|I completely fell in love with this Christmas story--of Luther and Nora Krank (who could think of a better last name?), who, in the absence of their only daughter, decide to \\"skip\\" the holiday season and take a cruise instead--the intent being to save thousands on \\"useless\\" gifts while maintaining their own sanity amidst the usual frenzied holiday chaos.  The only thing they succeed in doing, however, is appearing \\"Kranky\\" and Scrooge-like to their neighbors and the surrounding community.<br />When their daughter calls and announces that she is coming home for a surprise holiday visit--and bringing her Peruvian fiancee, so that he may see Christmas at its finest in America and in her neighborhood--the race is on to do everything that they had sworn that they were not going to do; buy the gifts, plan their annual Christmas Eve party (at this point, only hours in advance), beg people to attend, \\"steal\\" a Christmas tree, mount Frosty on the roof....and the list of hilarious shenanigans goes on.<br />The best thing about this book was the ending..kudos to JG for wrapping this story up like the bow on a beautiful Christmas gift. They say good things come in small packages, and this holiday tale certainly proves this to be true.
B00005JLXC|5.0|With the recent releases of X-MEN SPIDERMAN, the upcoming release of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, X-MEN 2 and THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN, it appears that MARVEL is on a roll with the comic book-to-film adventures. And from previews, DAREDEVIL looks set to add another notch to MARVEL'S box-office successes. I thought XMEN and SPIDERMAN were fantastic, and this is a must-see for comic book fans. The film stars Ben Affleck as the title hero, Jennifer Garner as Elektra, Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin and Colin Farrell as bad guy Bullseye. With plenty of spectacular action, vertigo-inducing camera swoops and great one-liners, this one looks set to be one of the best films of 2003.

B00003CXAE|5.0|My DVD collection is small but very select. Grease was one movie I knew I needed to own.  This anniversary edition DVD is great because of the cast interviews AND there is even a little song book included so you can sing along to some of the best music that will bring back the feeling of the 50s and early 60s. <br />It is a little hard to believe that it's been more than 20 years since it first came out until you look at the actors! Travolta and Newton-John look SO YOUNG! But this movie still gets to me every time I watch it. There are great songs (Greased Lightnin', Summer Nights, You're the One that I Want) and memorable performances (Stockard Channing as Rizzo is a classic!). <br />The story brings back a time when teens were \\"boys and girls\\", not very sophisticated in the ways of the big bad world. It evokes a little bit of the feel of my teen years and those are the clothes (poodle skirts, petticoats, bobby socks and saddle shoes) that I remember. Sure, sexuality simmered just under the surface, but there were more 'Sandra Dees' than there were 'Cha Chas' and the Rebels didn't run the schools and dictate the tastelessness that seems to rule today. Underwear was worn under outerwear and the most anyone saw was a droopy bra strap. <br />The story is sweet, simple and classical. Boy meets Girl, they fall in love, there is a bumpy patch and then Everyone lives happily ever after. In \\"Grease\\" getting to The End is lots of fun! There are songs for every occasion and some of the most energetic and exciting dance sequences in a contemporary movie. John Travolta is wonderful as Danny Zucko and Olivia Newton-John makes a perfect Sandy. <br />I always have a great time when I see this movie. I bet you will, too.
0671027344|3.0|While what this novel explores is by no means new ground, it is at the same time so honest and accurate in depicting the psyche of its teenager protagonist that it will easily keep you intrigued and interested.<BR>     Using a very effective trick, namely, a letter (or diary) form narration you become acquainted with the life and works of Charlie, a teenager, who is not \\"cool\\" or in any way popular (thus \\"wallflower\\"), but who becomes sort of an  escort for you you in his world as he tries to cope: growing up, learning, failing, failing again, sometimes succeeding, and everything the journey at that particular age involves.<BR>    Naturally, it envolves themes that everyone that has been a teenager is to one degree or another  familiar with. Drugs, experimenting with sexuality, learning about emotions, trying to interpret, trying to define the everyday reality he's into.<BR>   Utterly convincing, the story feels like it was written by a teenager at his teenage years (kudos to the author then ). <BR>    I personally caught myself reminiscing most of the time as i went through the sometimes simplistic questions that Charlie poses. That speaks volumes because caught reminiscing while reading a story like that is a good sign. It means the story is \\"accurate\\" , as accurate a novel like that can be since we all experience many different types of reality.<BR>    \\"The perks of being a wallflower\\" is also full of many humorous moments the kind of \\"funniness\\" that emerges when you are learning about life and commit yourself to mistakes or situations that might seem to you as super tragic or critical but they are just part of the process of growing up and later on you reinstate them for what they really are.<BR>    One of the few novels of that kind that explore homosexuality in a plain natural manner \\"The perks...\\" is a winner there too.<BR>   Recommended reading not only for those that want to compare notes of their past (or even present) but especially for those bringing upkids. It's one thing to have been there and another to remember how it really feels like going through it.<BR>    And when it comes to describing the \\"feeling\\" of it all, the helplessness and the agony or the angst of teenagehood \\"The perks...\\" is a wonderful contribution.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Like many others have stated, it's certainly refreshing to have a release of this caliber sell through the roof.  Whatever kind of singer you want to call Norah, she certainly has talent.  When the album first came out, she was actually labeled and filed in the JAZZ sections of record stores, which her label Blue Note sadly realized was the kiss of death.  She quickly got relocated to the pop section and the great word of mouth made this one of the best (and best selling) releases of the year.  My only wish would be for those who are enchanted by Norah's music to check out other deserving vocalists, such as Cassandra Wilson and Kevin Mahogany, who like Norah are hard to classify but have talent to burn.  If sales of Cassandra and Kevin could be Norahesque, then 2003 would get off to a great start.

B00007E8V4|5.0|If this had been marketed as a brand new album by System of a Down and as the follow-up to their mega-hit 'Toxicity,' everyone would be fooled. This is, just like always, top-notch System of a Down. Despite the fact that 'Steal This Album' is composed mostly of 'Toxicity' rejects, a lot of the songs on here rival the quality of the songs from that album. Songs like \\"Roulette,\\" \\"Innervision\\" and \\"Chick N' Stew\\" sound much better than songs that dragged down 'Toxicity' like \\"Prison Song\\" and \\"Jet Pilot.\\" Not everything here is entirely new. \\"Streamline\\" appeared on the Scorpion King soundtrack and \\"Chick N' Stew\\" has been floating around the internet in various forms since SOAD's first album came out. Really, there is not a track on here I don't enjoy. This CD is very addictive. What other band could put out a b-sides album as good as this? With most bands, b-sides are left off for a good reason, but with System of a Down, this just is not the case. On a side note, I feel I must comment on System of a Down's recent popularity. 2002 was a big year for them. 'Toxicity' went multiplatinum and spawned three radio/MTV hits. Personally, as a long time fan, I am proud of the band for their accomplishments. If anything, their popularity proves that creativity can still thrive in the mainstream. In a music world currently consisting of bands with the trademark \\"begins with 'the' and ends in 'es',\\" System of a Down are doing their part to keep things interesting. Let's hope they keep up the good work and keep giving us the killer music we all love so much.
0553212478|5.0|If a reader was to compare the macabre gothic darkness in the novels of Frankenstein, Dracula and The Phantom of the Opera, one would believe that the element of horror and depravity in each book would be on an equal standing. But the reader would be incorrect, for in respects to horror, somberness, trauma, deprivation of love, empathy and respect, Frankenstein towers above the others. It has a hybrid of excessive melancholy despair and disturbing horror. It is a work of literature where the gothic element is pushed to the zenith. Where Dracula is a novel of lust and physical intimacy, at its core, it is still a novel of love-however warped and disturbing it may be. Where the Phantom in Gaston Leroux's novel is a more well-rounded representative of human needs, Frankenstein really isn't. If anything he is a full throttled representation of anger and rage. And that is only one side of human dynamics. His is a living organism, created and plunked into the epicenter of humanity, a walking, thinking experiment that goes terribly awry. Frankenstein is not a creature of God-and perhaps therein is where the problem lies-but a concoction of man's arrogance and man's wickedness for unrepentant self-glorification. One could easily say that he is the genuine embodiment of the true son of Satan, albeit a human one. And that is truely appalling. He is the son of evil who is able to see and feel the horror of his own birth. How ironic! His abomination is both internal and external. Frankenstein obviously addresses numerous contemporary issues: the medical ethics of cloning, the wanton lack of family responsibility and the dangers that arise as a result of it, and lastly-the sometimes subtle, sometimes not-emotional evolution of humans into self-proclaimed gurus or demigods. Is there really a stark difference between Dr. Frankenstein and say, the megalomaniac Reverend Jim Jones of the People's Temple or Marshall Applewhite of Heaven's Gate? Dr. Frankenstein untimately comes to his senses when it is too late, but his desire for historical immortality via creative and scientific recklessness is no different then the hunger of contemporary, psychotic cultist gurus or tyrannical dictators-evil doers who are willing to go at any extreme in order to be remembered. Religion often plays a part in gothic works. The idea of a higher authority isn't always blatantly addressed, but its essence is surely felt. Dracula was at one point a human being who casts God to the side, makes his own decision and evolves into a horror of his own making. The phantom was a deformed being who, because of his skeletal appearance, was cast into the scummy bowls of Paris. But there was something that both of these characters had-and without sounding like a preacher-simply, they had God, a force whom they could turn to for strength and persistence. And what did Frankenstein have? A god, a father, a force who turned his back on him. Frankenstein is an especially sad novel, because the monster is truly alone in every sense of the word. He is a genetic calamity whereby only suicide could be his salvation. Mary Shelly incorporated many possibilities in this novel for the creature to find happiness, numerous inroads for human acceptance; a case-in point would be the various scenes with the creature's 'beloved' cottagers, but just when you think you have the progress of the story 'licked,' you are deceived and led down another road entirely: from hopelessness, to hope, to hopelessness, back to hope. Elegantly written and truly thought-provoking, Frankenstein is a novel that can't be limited in the things it has to say.

B000000HZZ|5.0|The quintessential urban European artpop album.  GTP is one of the era's creamiest, capturing the lite angst and rainy balustrades of being a young alien being in a big city.  A lot of credit for the splendid sound of the album goes to producer John Punter and to the musicianship that fleshes out Sylvian's rather loose songs -- intricate and forcefully played drums and percussion, Mick Karn's Chaplinesque bass, beautifully programmed synthesizers, and key guest spots by Simon House on violin and Ruichi Sakamoto (on all of Taking Islands in Africa), and several female vocalists.  Completed when the band was still shimmying under the eyeshadow of Roxy Music, there's nevertheless not a dud in the collection (except, perhaps, the sombre Bowie-Eno pastiche, Burning Bridges) and this version benefits from the inclusion of two 7&quot;-only instrumentals not on the original. Many of the tracks have become firm fan favourites (the title track, Swing, Methods of Dance and the utterly beguiling Nighporter, which sticks Erik Satie at a bar with a south-London Baudelaire, to deliciously maudlin effect) but special mention has to go to My New Career (one of Sylvian's most underrated) and the cover of Ain't That Peculiar, which swings in a special moody, distracted, late night way.
B00005OB0A|5.0|Ok I will justify why Kylie is compared to Madonna here in Britain.... basically everyone who has grown up in the 80's plus in the UK, has grown up with Kylie! She has gone from an actress in the australian soap Neighbours to a fantastic singer who has over the years transformed her image through a number of amazing styles! Like Madonna she is constantly changing - in a sense modernising - and trying to satisfy a range of tastes in the popular music world! Although Madonna and Kylie have different sorts of music, it would be stupid to believe that they are entirely different from one another as it is clear that they are both amazing idols of pop music (Pop obviously meaning 'Popular' music, and not just tacky stuff like many perceive it mean!).<BR>In Britain Kylie is even more of child to us that Madonna (even though they are not even from here!), as we have watched her grow, and we have seen her turn into a mega star! <BR>So please don't dissmiss the idea of her being like Madonna, cause in my eyes they have succeeded on similar grounds!<BR>Cheers!<BR>(a wee scottish lassy)

0316666343|4.0|What an interesting story this is!  A topic that sounds so awful and distasteful - a story that starts with the rape and murder of a 14 year old girl - but the ensuing tale of the girl coming to terms with her fate, her family's struggle to right itself in the aftermath of her murder and the resolution to the story was so good, I couldn't put this book down.  It evoked many strong feelings in me as I followed along with what the family had to go through in the years after her death.  I thought the ending, with its super-natural twist, was a risk on Sebold's part, but I think it worked and I felt satisfied.  I want to read her other book \\"Lucky\\" next.
0316666343|4.0|In addition to others I could not put this book down. Yes, I cried; I laughed; I  felt. It is what I needed. I do agree with others that the ending was indeed strange. And of course I would have preferred George Harvey to endure an awful, painful death. If you have lost a loved one and need to understand more, even though this was only the authors interpretation of \\"Heaven\\" and the ability to \\"look down on us\\" as we all imagine our loved ones being able to do then this is the book for you. I would recommend it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|What an amazing album.  I wish more people would overlook her image (of course, I don't see what the big deal is) & place judgment on her outstanding talent instead.  I am a huge music fan of all types w/ approx. 300 CD's in various genres of music & I must say that Stripped is one of, maybe even my most favorite CD.   CA has proven her unparalleled talent with this album as she was completely involved in writing, producing, & composing.  It is comprised of beautiful/inspirational lyrics, an offering of diverse genres of music, well-arranged production, & a powerful Angelic voice that soars to the Heavens (what a voice).  As a 32 year old music fan I have profound respect for Christina.  Every song on this CD could be submitted as a single because they are all spectacular.  & I cannot believe all the hype over the song DIRRTY.  Give me a break.  I mean, take a look at all the hip-hop & rap music/videos & all you see are provocative sexually explicit portrayals of women & nothing is hardly ever said.  But CA comes out with a little fun & sexy song & video wearing a bikini top w/ little shorts & everybody freaks out.  They say it's to racey for young teens - I mean come on.  When I was in my early teens/teens I was a huge Prince fan (still am) & nobody was/is as sexually explicit as him.  However, I was raised with morals & understood the difference between a stage/image/celebrity persona & also understood that his actions/image was not appropriate for my age.  But I still appreciated my parents for trusting my intellect & enjoyed having the freedom to idolize his amazing talent as an artist.  & hay, I certainly turned out okay.  Now, let me state that I am by no means comparing CA to Prince, because lets face it, Prince is in his own category regarding sexuality; however, I am trying to make a point that CA's image is by far the degrading persona that the uptight conservatives are making it out to be.  Lighten up people.  CA is in a class all her own & should never again be compared to bubble-gum pop as this album has completely \\"Stripped\\" her from this category.  She has soared to a new level of musical maturity & integrity.  For anybody who does not yet own this album I suggest to please buy it, even buy it for your kids.  Aside from the \\"so called offensive\\" \\"DIRTY\\" track, every other song on this CD is encouraging, inspirational, heartening, & invigorating, almost therapeutic to teens/adults.  This CD appeals to all including kids, teens, parents, grandparents.  You will be completely mesmerized & amazed.
006016848X|4.0|&iexcl;§Men are From Mars, Woman are From Venus&iexcl;¨ (MAFM) is filled with insightful advice and many illustrative examples on how to communicate effectively in relationships. Gray places a large emphasis on the importance of marital relationships and endeavors to help couples, going through rough times, to communicate effectively with each other. Within the context of modern society, where marriage is very often presented in popular media as an archaic social construct, it is refreshing to find a person that regards marriage with such high esteem.<br />MAFM explores some of the fundamental differences between men and women and seeks to explain why men/women act in the way they do. Gray aims to help readers to understand &iexcl;§how completely different men and women are&iexcl;¨ but encouragingly teaches &iexcl;§ways for successfully relating with, listening to, and supporting the opposite sex.&iexcl;¨ Gray places a large emphasis on &iexcl;§practical techniques&iexcl;¨ and calls MAFM &iexcl;§a practical manual for how to succeed in creating loving relationships.&iexcl;¨ MAFM is drawn from the author&iexcl;¦s own observations in an active counseling practice and from his own experience as a married man and father.<br />Men are described as &iexcl;§rubber bands.&iexcl;¨ According to Gray, a man needs to &iexcl;§pull away to fulfill his need for independence or autonomy.&iexcl;¨ Gray asserts that if men do &iexcl;§not have an opportunity to pull away, he never gets a chance to feel his strong desire to feel close.&iexcl;¨ Gray also observes, &iexcl;§When a man is stressed he will withdraw into the cave of his mind and focus on solving a problem.&iexcl;¨ Women, on the other hand, are described as &iexcl;§waves.&iexcl;¨ &iexcl;§When she feels loved,&iexcl;¨ says Gray, &iexcl;§her (a woman&iexcl;¦s) self-esteem rises and falls in a wave motion.&iexcl;¨ Gray notes that, &iexcl;§a woman&iexcl;¦s ability to give and receive love in her relationships is generally a reflection of how she is feeling about herself.&iexcl;¨ Gray also asserts women, in general, &iexcl;§feel better by talking about solving problems.&iexcl;¨<br />Gray asserts, &iexcl;§Most of our complex emotional needs can be summarized as the need for love.&iexcl;¨ He then identifies the primary needs of men as &iexcl;§trust, acceptance, appreciation, admiration, approval and encouragement.&iexcl;¨ Woman&iexcl;¦s primary emotional needs, says Gray, are &iexcl;§caring, understanding, respect, devotion, validation and reassurance.&iexcl;¨ Once these primary needs have been isolated, Gray argues that, for a successful relationship, a husband must be willing to meet the emotional needs of his wife and vice versa. If men/women do not set out to fulfill each other&iexcl;¦s needs then they may be unknowingly hurting their partner.  &iexcl;§Love,&iexcl;¨ says Gray, &iexcl;§often fails because people instinctively give what they want&iexcl;K.So they are caught in a loop of failing to fulfill each other&iexcl;¦s needs.&iexcl;¨ Gray asserts that &iexcl;§if men and women learn how to support each other in the ways that are most important for their own unique needs, change and growth will become automatic.&iexcl;¨<br />Gray also addresses the complex issue of arguments, and how they can be avoided. He asserts that men and women should &iexcl;§negotiate&iexcl;¨ for what they want but that they shouldn&iexcl;¦t &iexcl;§argue.&iexcl;¨ &iexcl;§The secret to avoiding arguments,&iexcl;¨ says Gray, &iexcl;§is loving and respectful communication.&iexcl;¨ He stresses that arguments should be identified and, once identified, people should stop and take a time out. He says that arguments are started for one reason: &iexcl;§we are not feeling loved.&iexcl;¨ Although there may be apparent surface issues the deeper issue is the lack of love that a person feels. During difficult times in a relationship, it is important, according to Gray, &iexcl;§to try to communicate with a loving, validating, and approving attitude.&iexcl;¨ If we endeavor to understand the emotional needs of our partner and work towards meeting those needs then arguments can be avoided.<br />Gray also sets about illuminating positive methods to communicate difficult emotions and needs to ones partner. He acknowledges the importance of having emotional needs met and constantly emphasizes that we need to inform our partners as to what those needs are and how to communicate those needs effectively to each other. His use of letters with clearly defined formats that encourage simple and meaningful communication are novel in their method and style. It is certainly something I will attempt to use in the future when I wish to communicate difficult feelings to my wife.<br />Although I find myself in agreement with much that is in this book, I do not agree with the expectations that he places within people. Gray talks about the &iexcl;§love you deserve&iexcl;¨ and emphasizes this point towards the end of the book. I do not believe that it is correct to expect anything within a relationship although I feel I am obliged to give 100%. If I expect certain needs to be met, and those needs are not met, I will feel very disappointed. Other points I disagree with is his insistence that we get in touch with our repressed, painful feelings. Although they need to be worked out, we should not hover over them and be victims to them. We should rather empower ourselves in the here and now than be slaves to the past.<br />Apart from these differences, I found MAFM to be an encouraging book that delves into the depths of relationships and the causes for failures. The practical examples that are provided are insightful and do reflect the reality of relationships. Ultimately, this book is no guarantee to successful relationships, but rather it provides willing partners, who are both prepared to commit 100% to the relationship, greater understanding into the psych of their chosen one.

B00006HBUA|1.0|For SCOOBY DOO purists, and I'd hate to think that such a creature exists or, worse, that I'm one of them, this nightmare of a film contained little humor, little joy, little intrigue and little mystery. This was just out-and-out awful.<br />Matthew Lillard's voice sounded a lot like Casey Kasem's take on Shaggy from the TV series. Oh, and the ending made a villain out of a character everyone hated anyway. There, those are my only compliments.<br />Scooby's annoying. Velma's nothing like herself. The ghosts are real ... and the ghosts and plot are too scary for kids. Fred is more of a one-dimensional figure now than he was when he was a cartoon. Daphne's characterization, not that they had much to build from since these aren't really &quot;characters&quot; in the sense that they ever had history or personality, is almost insulting, for they turn her into a really dim damsel-in-distress archetype. (Sarah Michelle Gellar deserves much, much better - and routinely gets better material when she's on BUFFY.)<br />It's not funny. The soundtrack's even annoying. It's not good for kids. It doesn't look good for a movie. And it doesn't make sense. It, in fact, makes less sense than even the most far-fetched of mysteries on the old TV show.<br />This is awful, awful, awful. Avoid it.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Their songs are sung in German, they mix almost delicate keyboard and orchestral arrangements with metal, they use plastic penises as stage props, and the lead singer has been known to set himself on fire during shows.  All of that could be detriments to the average European band trying to appeal to American audiences, but for Germany's Rammstein, slamming music and over-the-top stage antics are what set them apart.  More melodic than Marilyn Manson, way darker than Trent Reznor could ever hope to be, and heavier than any other band out there, Rammstein is a shining beacon in the darkness that limp nu-metal brought this last decade.  \\"Mutter,\\" their third CD, should be an essential addition to the collection of anyone who likes their metal melodic but scary enough to make the neighbors pull the kids inside when you go by playing this in your car stereo.<br />I'd heard of Rammstein for a while, but the first song I ever heard from them was \\"Feuer frei!\\" (English translation: \\"Fire freely!\\") which was played on the soundtrack of the Vin Diesel film \\"XXX.\\"  Crunchy riffs, \\"come here right now and let me slam your head through the wall!\\" growled vocals, and a beat that had me banging my head involuntarily the moment it started ...  excellent!  In this age of the majority of CDs having two good songs and nine lousy ones, \\"Mutter\\" is terrific from the first notes of \\"Mein Herz brennt\\" (\\"My Heart Burns\\"), which sounds kind of like Led Zeppelin a case of good German beer down, to the good old fashioned stadium stomp \\"Ich Will\\" (\\"I Want\\"), to the power ballad title track (\\"Mother\\") where lead singer Till Lindesmann actually sings (usually his vocals are guttural but highly effective chants), to the sinister \\"Spieuhr\\" (\\"Music Box\\"), which is at once poppy and brutal, to the Slayer-meets-Duran Duran-sounding \\"Sonne\\" (\\"Sun\\"), to the lovely orchestra on the final notes of \\"Nebel\\" (\\"Mist\\").  It doesn't matter if you don't know German-the harshness of the language fits the music perfectly, even if it does makes singing along a little difficult, and should not prevent you from enjoying the CD.  If you're really dying to know what Till's singing, a number of websites (I recommend herzeleid.com) provide the English translations-as a rule, Rammstein's favorite themes are sex and death, with occasional bits of incest thrown in to liven things up, and the lyrics on \\"Mutter\\" are no exception.  As a friend of mine says, \\"You don't turn people on to Rammstein's music-you corrupt them with it!\\"  If you're a fan of hard rock in any way, shape or form, get \\"Mutter.\\"  NOW.  You won't regret it.
B000069HK2|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim. I had never heard these guys before (I had heard of them, but never their music). I liked them right off, but only in a 3&amp;1/2-4 star kind of way. But as I listened more and more I really started focusing in on the music and the lyrics, and I think this is one of my top albums of the year. It's got that &quot;punk&quot; sensibility but with a lot of melody and heart. <br />My favorite songs are: Buried Myself Alive, Blue and Yellow, and Noise and Kisses.<br />This is a great band. I hope they are around for a while.
0316666343|2.0|I very much wanted to read The Lovely Bones when I heard about it, because I thought that the concept of a story being told from the point of view of a dead character watching from heaven was an intriguing narrative tool.  I still think that it probably is an interesting tool, but Sebold fails to take advantage of it here.<br />As many readers probably know, from the author's other publication, Alice Sebold was a victim of rape during her teenage years.  The Lovely Bones reads like Sebold simply tooled up her journal entries, added in some fictional out of body (or is it 'in someone else's body'?) experience, and convinced someone to publish it.  The book has basically no plot, which is where it fails on the narratives.  The author fails to define a problem, let alone set about solving it.  The book instead rambles on in somewhat this fashion, from the main character's point of view:I was raped and murdered, bummer.  My family is having a terrible time getting over it, big bummer.  They aren't going to catch my killer, major bummer.  I just fell down from heaven and possesed another person's body (ala Patrick Swayze in Ghost) and had sex with a guy, something I didn't get to do before I died, cool.  The End.<br />The entire book reads like the author was self administering psychotherapy.  Oh, look what happened to me and my family!  Isn't it awful? While it is true that there is something compelling about this book from a voyeristic point of view (the only reason that it got 2 stars), it basically doesn't live up to it's promise.  Unless a reader enjoys feeling like a voyer while watching this family go through tons of pain, they aren't likely to enjoy this book.  While I, and I'm sure all readers, sympathize with Miss Sebold's horrible expereince, it certainly doesn't make good fiction.<br />Alice Sebold promises to be a good writer, but she needs to stop trying so hard to be brilliant and different and try working a little more at the basics of plot.  Those familiar with the book We Were the Mulvaneys by Joyce Carol Oates, have seen this mistake before.
B00005JKZT|5.0|When Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring came out in 2001, it easily took the title of Greatest Fantasy Film Of All Time (with the possible exception of John Boorman's Excalibur - but that's a subject for another review). That all changed last month when The Two Towers, FOTR's sequel, premiered.<br />Yes, folks, Peter Jackson has pulled off the nifty trick of making a film even more jaw-droppingly beautiful than his FOTR. In a world where most sequels are nothing more than blatant cash-ins, Jackson has made one that manages to be simultaneously more spectacular and complex than the original.<br />Of course, it never hurts to have good source material. The trick is pulling off J.R.R. Tolkien's singular mix of the epic and the personal. LOTR, like many great stories before and after it, is primarily a story about little people (literally, in this case) caught up in big events. If one doesn't hit just the right balance between the two, the whole thing falls apart. Jackson, thank goodness, does just that.<br />Friends - I could go on and on about this film: the amazing special effects, the breathtaking battle sequences - heck, I could do an entire review about Jackson's uncanny gift for composition. I could also talk about all the nonsense I've read in ostensibly \\"intellectual\\" magazines about how all this fantasy stuff is irrelevant - merely an escape from the harsh realities of our world. All I know is that LOTR - book and films - are about the importance of courage and friendship in an increasingly horrifying world. Now I ask you - what could possibly be more relevant than that?
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters Inc. is a superb family film.  Many other reviewers have laid out the film's plot, so I will simply outline the parts that I liked.<br />John Goodman and Billy Crystal are an awesome comic pairing that will have everyone laughing.  While the movie is funny and has a good guy vs. bad guy plot, there is nothing to worry about your children seeing.  The movie is completely devoid of off-color humor and violence.  Parents who have felt that even children's movies were becoming too sexualized and/or violent, will find a welcome respite.  <br />Monsters Inc. is also a good looking movie.  The animation is excellent, even to the point of really expressing emotions on the characters 'faces'.  I think it is the best animation ever made thus far.<br />The DVD version contains an entire disc of extras and outtakes.  They alone are worth the purchase price.  Just imagine, John Goodman and Billy Crystal cutting up in the outtakes, it's hilarious!  Get Monsters Inc. You won't be disappointed.
B000002GVO|5.0|\\"Hotel California\\" the song is so great, it could pretty much carry the album, but it doesn't need to.  While I also enjoy the other songs, \\"Hotel California\\" is so good that it causes everything else on this album to be eclipsed, even though much of the rest of the music is very good.  The Eagles created a series of very good songs, but when \\"Hotel California\\" was recorded and released, I think every listener realized that it was destined to be a great song from the beginning.  Surrealistic, clearly southern California desert influenced, a song that becomes great because it is musical art accessible to nearly everyone.<br />While \\"Hotel California\\" is a great song, several other songs on this CD are excellent.  \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" and \\"Victim of Love\\" show some of the influence that Joe Walsh had on the previously country-flavored Eagles, as does the guitar heavy ending of \\"Hotel California\\".<br />There are several songs that fall into the ballad category, such as \\"New Kid in Town\\", \\"Wasted Time\\" and \\"Try and Love Again\\".  Then there are the other songs, including \\"The Last Resort\\", which is a preachy song, but also a pretty song about the environment.<br />The problem for The Eagles was that one song pretty much defined this album, and the group.  Try listening to this album without \\"Hotel California\\", and you will find some decent, well-played songs.  Many of the lyrics are very inspired, and this would have been a hit-making album.  Add back \\"Hotel California\\", and you have an album that becomes a musical icon for a group and a generation.  I love this song (like nearly everyone else that likes The Eagles), but this album is more than one song.  As an album, it is one of my favorite Eagle albums.  However, come for the Hotel, stay for the other courses...
B00006C7G9|5.0|Every American needs to see this entire movie to be able to appreciate not only the soldiers who served but also the freedom in which we live.   If it weren't for people like this, we wouldn't be living the way we do today.  Anyone who doesn't understand or like the military needs to see this, and gain a new understanding.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Almost every song on this album is very good.This album is really fantastic, super, great! Buy it!
0783227272|4.0|Amistad is a very moving and thought provoking movie.  It gives us a look at a part of our past which we should all learn more about.<br />The story focuses on the struggle of illegally captured Africans to re-gain their freedom and return to their native Africa.  The Africans are captured, transported to Cuba and then transferred to another ship, La Amistad, for the final leg of their journey.  However, there is a mutany and the Africans seize control of the ship.  All but two of the white crew members are killed during the mutany.  When the ship nears land, Long Island, to replenish deminished water supplies, they are captured and face trial for murder.  <br />The drama that unfolds is fastening and disturbing.  The struggle over freedom is based in determining if the Africans are actually illegally seized Africans or if they are slaves, that is if they were born into slavery, and therefore property.<br />  The ensuing legal battle gives the viewer a look into the many conflicting forces that were at play in the United States during the 1830s.  It is also a sobering look at how the politically powerful tried to manipulate the legal system to get their desired ends.<br />Cast is very strong and gives a very moving performance.
B000068TPN|4.0|To all those who cripe about this movie not being realistic and trudging up 'Apocalypse Now' as an exemplary Viet Nam flick, I say &quot;Get out of the 1970s.&quot; Not every colonel in Viet Nam was a psychotic, megalomaniacal fool. Not every GI burned villages for sport.<br />Did those things happen? Sure. But they were not the ONLY thing that happened. The war was fought primarily by average people in a totally fubar situation, created chiefly by our own government and its provincial myopia.<br />Are there a ton of John Wayne-ish cliches in this movie? You bet. And it also shortchanges the futility of the heroism of the Air Cavalry. But it's a long overdue positive look at the guys who fought and died.
0066214122|5.0|I have read stories before, several, ranging from the classics to the modren times.  Michael Crichton's Prey is the most unique story I've ever read.  The depth of knowledge displayed in the story is unparalled by the possible exception of Tom Clancy, who knows so much about what he writes that there is little room left for plot.  Crichton once again becomes the cheif American Storyteller with the latest book that is so fun and enjoyable that you will not even noticed how far you have read in it by the time you've finished.
B000067CPX|2.0|Forget the hype.  This CD, except for maybe a song or two, is one big bore.  Aimless melodies, cliched lyrics, and rhythmically uninventive.  Probably the worst album of their career.  Save your money unless you like being bored for 70+ minutes.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This movie is awsome!  I have seen it 3 times and I would like to see it a fourth!  This movie passes the first installment by far!  It is 3 hours and 15 minutes long but it is worth the time.  It is very different from the book and there is less Merry and Pippin and also less of Frodo and Sam than in the Fellowship of the Ring.  Some parts were a little two long for me (like Sam talking forever to Frodo about not giving up or something!) but all the other great parts made up for it!  The best part was that Orlando Bloom (Legolas) actually had some LINES in this movie!!!!!  I totally love Orlando! If you see the movie, there is also a trailer for Pirates of the Caribbean, a new movie starring Johnny Depp, Geoffery Rush, and ORLANDO BLOOM! But anyway, I suggest this movie to anyone who luvs LOTR.  Peter Jackson is truly a genious! The movie may be hard to follow to thoughs who have not read the book series, as with the first one.  In this movie, it is slightly confusing because it is night one minute and the previous day or following day the next minute.  It goes forward and back in time a lot to track the tree 'parties' the fellowship has divided into. Despite the confusion, the script, and camara work, and especially the special effects excelled beyond my expectations! The battle of Helms Deep was spectacular!  There were also a few witty lines in the movie and the score was the best I have heard in a long time!  My favorite music was the violin music they play in Edoras. The actors have talent beyond belief!  You can hardly tell that they aren't aragorn or gimli or frodo or something!  How come you can understand Viggo Mortenson in the movie but I need subtitles to understand his interviews?  Strange...
B00005JKZT|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE! It was sad, funny, romantic, adventurous, scary, and vicious! I thought that it was not long enough! Plus that cute Legolas is it it!:):):)! Anyway, i highly reccommend this movie to ANYONE!
B00005MM67|5.0|One would expect this movie to be a docudrama or some cheesy IMAX film about climbers with nothing more than your average 'wife left behind' problems. This film is actually based upon a stage play (and some real people), and as a result has some well written character development and of course spectacular climbing scenes. Many of the risks of climbing are dealt with in this film, along with the personal rewards and above all, the competitive nature of the climbers. (How would you feel if you are almost to the top of K2 and the team leader tells you that you can't go to the top at all?)
0553328255|5.0|Sherlock holmes, master consulting detective is at work in 56 short stories and 4 novels, which is everything ever written about the great detective,  those of you who have never read sherlock holmes will be addicted after the first story you read, for those of you who have only read some, well here is the rest of them in one book. From a study in scarlet to the adventure of the retired colourman you will come across unique characters, with a variety of cases which range from robbery to murder. if u want proof of how good these stories are listen to this: after sir arthur conan doyle killed off holmes in the final problem, so many fans were trying to get him to come back, so he had no choice to write more, now how does that sound for a fanbase, if u are remotely interested in mysteries or crime, this is the book for you
B00003CXHJ|4.0|This film is so suspenseful, you could almost throw your nail clippers away and just watch U-571!  Granted, our friends in Great Britain are rightly peeved to see what is labeled as based on a true story to have the glaring error that it was the USA rather than Britain who actually performed the capture of the Enigma machine.<br />However, with that kept in mind, Jonathan Mostow does a great job of creating suspense with screenplay and direction.  His last film \\"Breakdown\\" was a tight suspense flick with Kurt Russell trying to find his kidnapped wife.  I saw this after seeing \\"K-19: The Widowmaker\\" and enjoyed this one much more.<br />Johnny Johnson who did the sound for \\"A Knight's Tale\\" has created a great wall of sound effect that has buzzers and blasts going off, creating a great sonic setting that enhances the picture.<br />Matthew McConaughey as Lt. Andrew Tyler does a good job of showing the somewhat green commander coming into his own and able to make life & death decisions when necessary.  Bill Paxton's voice acted as a sedative for me because he was SO calm.  Harvey Keitel as Chief Klough does an excellent job.  One scene where he counsels Tyler that a captain must show his crew that he ALWAYS knows, even when he doesn't, to ensure confidence and cooperation is particularly effective.  Jon Bon Jovi as Lt. Pete Emmett does a good job.  I also liked the skitterish Trigger played by Tom Guiry who eventually drowns while trying to repair the torpedo, the crew's only chance of survival.  After appearances in Black Hawk Down & Tigerland, he's becoming a war flick fixture.<br />So while the British are understandably cool to the flick, it does wind the mechanism of suspense to the breaking point.  The special effects of explosions are also excellent.  This is a great evening's entertainment.  Enjoy!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Tatu is a wonderful display of talent and courage. The songs are wonderful and the girls are amazing for having the courage to come here and openly show their opinions to our prejudiced country. I admire them and the cd is WELL worth the money and will give anyone plenty of entertainment.
B00003CXSP|4.0|First piece of advice, see Silence of the Lambs, which was great, before you see this movie or else you might be a bit lost at points.  I don't want to spoil the plot, but out of all the Hannibal Lecter movies, this was not my favorite.  If i had to rank them it would Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, followed by Hannibal.  Don't get me wrong, it is still a good movie which is why I gave it four stars, and the ending is very interesting, if not disturbing.  Defintely recommend seeing it!

B00006F83Y|1.0|Inaccessible to those who were drawn in by the single &quot;know one knows&quot; This collection of weird noises is accented by drums that are way too high in the mix, I suspect to cash in on Dave Grohl's<BR>participation in whatever Queens of the stoneage is supposed to be. I was genuinely curious what Kyuss must have sounded like, I thought maybe I had overlooked them all these years, but after hearing this, I realize I was probably better off having never heard them. Maybe the worst of the problems are in the production, but since a principal in the band produced, they must have WANTED it to sound this way. <BR>The bass is overwhelming on most of the tracks, even louder than the already too loud drums. The vocalist is quite proficient, but again, lost in the mix, and weirdness. <BR>I hated &quot;no one knows&quot; when I first heard it, then <BR>became intriqued by how different it really was, enough to buy<BR>the CD. In a way its admirable, every song sounds like it might be a different band, the trouble with that is, I would'nt like any of them, and I feel cheated since I was already drawn in by a song that apparently is not representative of the &quot;sound&quot; of the band. There should be a label on stuff like this, in my opinion.

0783229321|1.0|This film is one of the films I like most. I just love the Rock and Roll era, although I was born in the 70's. And &quot;Animal House&quot; has the smell of that era.<br />For the film I would give 5 stars, but for that DVD edition I give just one. <br />Why??? Well, most of the original soundtrack was substituted by unknown songs. Sam Cooke's Twisting the Night Away, Wonderful World and Money, Let's Dance and others just disappeared from the DVD edition...I'm totally disappointed because a 50's or 60's movie MUST have songs from the period. OK...Louie Louie is there, but only Louie Louie...<br />I think Universal had some troubles with the rights of that songs. OK...but why don't let us know it???<br />In spite of it, the DVD is still worth of buying, but for sure the new sound track is terrible surprise for this film lovers.

B000002J1B|5.0|This is truely one of Yes best albums. Since the age of 12 I've been a huge yes fan. I purchased this album when it was first released (I was 16 then!). I had a difficult time getting into it because of the complexity of its arrangements, although that was my big attraction to Yes in the first place. Back then I considered Relayer as the bands attempt at something a little too different. What I failed to realize was that Relayer WAS different and a new experience in contemporary music. Well, for me, life began to get in the way over the years and I let it go as one of Yes &quot;okay&quot; albums. Recently I began listening to it again (for the first time) and it's an absolute masterpiece. Track 1 - Gates of Delirium takes you through a fantastic journey of rythmns, countermelodies, complex harmonies, and finishes with a beautiful, almost angelic song that moves your heart and soul. This is so characteristic of Yes in their prime. Jon Anderson's vocals in the ending are right on the money. Every note is carved with emotion while his ability to hold key is unwavering. Jon's expression here is very moving. Track 2 - Sound Chaser showcases Patrick Moraz, as a newcomer to Yes, strong compositional abilities and exceptional talent as a keyboard player. I've always revered Rick Wakeman as the &quot;BEST KEYBOARDEST&quot; for Yes, until I really gave Patrick Moraz a second chance. Now I see them as equals. You can easily determine that both have been serious students of classical music, which makes them exceptional contemporary musicians. Track 3 - To Be Over is a wonderful finish to the mix with it's easy to follow melody line. It's remeniscent of Yes earlier works like &quot;Dear Father&quot;, &quot;Survival&quot;, and &quot;Then&quot; with the experience of 5 other albums behind them. These guys are real musicians, masters of Rock Artistry, not simply Rock Artists. If you are looking for a real listening adventure, Relayer comes with the highest of recommendations. Afteryou listen to this album you'll &quot;wake up&quot; feeling very different.
B00006X06U|5.0|In Travelogue, Joni remakes many of her best original tunes and reinterprets her message in most of them. The orchestra and her beautiful voice breathe new life into old favorites. If you loved her remake of \\"A Case of You\\" on her 2000 CD Both Sides Now, then you'll love Travelogue, as well. I wouldn't have thought it possible, but I like a few of the songs on this release even better than on her earlier albums. This collection is a beautiful work and it's totally Joni: thoughtful lyrics, extraordinary melodies and refreshing instrumental accompaniment. Once this remarkable album grabs you, you won't let it go.
0140157352|4.0|Almost everyone can benefit from improved negotiating skills. This 1981 classic, updated in 1991 with new material responding to questions from readers, continues to provide practical guidelines for executives dealing with each other, with superiors and staff, with customers, partners, suppliers, and government regulators. If you have ignored this as a pop book, take a good look at it. This practical, non-academic, and well-illustrated book does not waste the reader's time with filler. The authors explain the problems that arise from bargaining over positions, presenting an alternative approach. Their method revolves around four elements: Separate the people from the problem; focus on interests, not positions; invent options for mutual gain; and insist on using objective criteria. They offer helpful approaches for situations where the other side is more powerful, refuses to play, or uses dirty tricks. The range of situations in which their approach can be applied is almost limitless. Keep this one close at hand to refer to repeatedly until \\"principled negotiation\\" becomes ingrained and natural.
0062502182|1.0|I read 'The Alchemist' just to satisfy my curiosity about a book that has been translated to dozens of languages and has captivated its readers the world over.<br />I found it to be a disastrously contrived, poorly crafted 'fable', the lowest comon denominator of many boring fables. It is a New Age con aimed at masses of insecure and unsophisticated globalized readers, a low attempt to extract a formula out of the truely inspirational 'The Little Prince', pepper it with 'spiritual' mumbo-jumbo and sell the result for profit to consumers who are supposed to be looking for 'transcendence, meaning and inspiration'.
0446530573|5.0|I asked for this book for christmas being a big sopranos fan.   I was quickly in for a great surprise.  Both my brother (who also got the book for christmas) and I were discussing the dishes and recipes and how familiar they looked.   We grew up eating dishes like this having an Brooklyn Italian mother and grandmother in the house who were excellent cooks.   The recipes even sounded familiar.   For New Years Eve, my wife treated me and the family to a selection of dishes including the Sunday Gravy, Chicken Francese, Meatballs, Escarole and little meatball soup, and even some shrimp scampi.   I felt like I was 10 again eating food prepared by my mother and grandmother.  The food was excellent.  To my surprise, I found out why these were so familiar.  I notice that the recipes were written by Michelle Scicolone.  The name looked familiar to me.  It turns out, Michelle and my mother were cousins, sharing the same Grandparents from Naples.   These REALLY ARE the recipes I grew up eating. I can't wait to pick up more cookbooks from Michelle. Buy this book if you love good, home cooked, italian food.  I'm still stuffed! My Aunt Louise raised and excellent chef!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I must say, I have NEVER been as inspired and in awe of any WWII movie or story.  Not just WWII, any war movie.  It blows &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; right out of the water.  I bought the book after watching the DVDs, and I read it completely in 2 days.  After reading the book, I'm watching it again....and this is all since I received the DVD set for Christmas.  You will be amazed at the massive undertaking which allowed for this great miniseries to be produced.  You will also enjoy the additional features of the DVD set, which includes interviews, behind the scenes footage, a great training video journal from Ron Livingston, who played Nixon in the film.  I HIGHLY recommend this set - too bad 5 stars is as high as it goes.
B000056JYC|5.0|Escuche por primera vez a Frampton cuando era el guitarrista principal de Humble Pie. Frampton puede ser un purista de la guitarra o jugar con los sonidos mediante el uso de pedales u otros artilugios. Lo cierto es que este concierto (parte de la filmaciòn se utilizò en el &quot;remake&quot; de la pelìcula Star is born protagonizada por KK y BS marcò un ito en nuevos estilos en el rock. La parte acùstica es interpretada con gran sentimiento, en especial, All I want to be y Baby, I love your way y la breve intro de Penny for your thoughts. Lines on my face y Do you feel like we do completan esta maravillosa obra musical.<br />The first time that I ever hear Frampton was when he was the lead guitar of Humble Pie. Frampton can play the guitar nice and clean but also can create special sounds with pedals and other gadgets. Parts of this concert were used for the remake of &quot;A star is born&quot; with KK and BS. With this work, Frampton mark his influence in rock music. The accoustic part is performed with special feeling (All want to be, Baby, I love your way and the intro for Penny for your thoughts). Lines on my face and Do you feel like we do complete this masterpiece...
0743216458|5.0|I received the DVD box set of Band of Brothers for Christmas, and once I put it in my player, I couldn't stop watching it.  It didn't end there.  The same day I finished all 6 CDs, I ran out and bought the book.  I finished the book in less than 2 days, and now I am searching the internet for additional material.  The story that Ambrose writes is just that inspiring.  Ambrose is such an easy writer to read.  It flows smoothly and you are gripping the pages as the battle ensues, and wiping tears as some of their comrades perish.  We lost one great author and historian when Ambrose died.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I did not go with my husband to see the first movie.  He did nothing but rave about it.  I finally saw the first movie on DVD. When The Two Towers came out I ran to see this one. Visually, the two movies are unsurpassed.  I for one, did not miss the presence of a woman in a strong character position. It was not necessary to throw a lot of love fluff into a wonderful and magical story. This is a story with great performances. You forget while watching that it's only a story. It's a story of honor, of courage, of friendship and magic.  There was not one moment in either movie where I became aware of time. The long, (three hour)movie was over in a flash and left me wanting for more. I would like to see 'The Two Towers' again, there was so much to look at in the fight scenes that I don't want to miss a thing.The Lord of The Ring movies are what good movie-making is all about.  It was a true labor of love.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album is great!! I'd say the best album of 2002. It's nice to see a band like the Lips continue to write great songs. They are geniuses. Rock on, baby!!!
B00004Z459|1.0|What a gimmick. These guys stumble upon the unique idea of having a singy-songy vocalist, and another one rapping. Never heard that before (311 did it, it was a bad idea, and LP makes you see it was really an awful idea.) And the techno beats with rock guitar just sound like garbage - just pop with a bit of distorted guitar so they don't sound 100% like the sissies they are. Yeah, they sound 99% sissy, and 1% rock n' roll. And that 1% is faked. I mean, Chester can easily replace Justin in N'Sync and no one would notice, that is a fact. Go man, that's your chance right there! Justin's gone solo! Be the real you! They really can't play. I mean, a couple of sustained power chords and a simple backbeat on the drums sprinkled with electronic-gadgets-generated silly sounds? Impressive technical ability! Amazing musicianship! I could have played these songs the first year I picked up the bass. This is just another Mtv ready pop act posing as \\"rap-rock.\\" Facts are facts.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore's composition of the Two Towers is purely genius. Howard's ability to capture the beauty and power of Middle-earth is breath-taking. The sensibility of the score is enhanced by the arrangment of the music. The music itself tells the story. The way Howard interlaces the diverse themes is phenominal. Shore's music highly compliments the film and adds depth to the intricate story. The fiddle of Rohan, the gloom of Gollum, and the various themes mixed in the battle of helms deep are some of my favorite moments which can be heard along with themes from the last movie. In conclusion, I highly recommend this work of art to anyone who enjoys quality music.
B00004XPP0|4.0|I also am looking for the entire Star Wars set on DVD.  I currently have Episodes I and II, but I am anxiously awaiting for the day when the Trilogy is available on DVD.  I hope that it is available at leat by next Christmas.
B000002UB3|5.0|It's a shame that this was the last album the Beatles did together as a group before splitting.  With two deaths already in the family, there won't be anymore like this album.<BR>1. Come Together: A good one from John Lennon. I liked the sound effects at the beginning.<BR>2. Something: I didn't like the mood in this song, but the lyrics are excellent, obviously written by George Harrison.<BR>3. Maxwell's Silver Hammer: I wonder what Paul was thinking when he wrote this one!  Maybe he was drunk, or had smoked too much!<BR>4. Oh! Darling: A very wonderful and emotional piece from Paul McCartney. Certainly brings some tears.<BR>5. Octopus's Garden: Obviously a Ringo Starr piece.  While it is a good addition to Yellow Submarine, it is not as good.<BR>6. I Want You (She's So Heavy): A hard rocker by John Lennon.  I loved the repititious ending, until it abruptly cuts off.<BR>7. Here Comes the Sun: Most people will recognize this one.  Certainly George Harrison at his finest, R.I.P. Little Darling.<BR>8. Because: More of a choral piece, but good lyrics.<BR>9. You Never Give Me Your Money: A great one with different moods.<BR>10. Sun King: Is ok, until it gets to the en espanol part.<BR>11. Mean Mr. Mustard/Polythene Pam: these are both the same song, just different tracks.  Humorous lyrics.<BR>12. She Came in through the bathroom window: Funny one, although the lyrics are confusing.<BR>13. Golden Slumbers/Carry that Weight: Wonderful lullaby and piece by Paul.<BR>14. The End: As the name says it, this is truly the last song by the Beatles as a group.  This one includes a little from everyone, from Ringo's drum taps to George's rockin' solo.<BR>15. Her Majesty: A last minute addition from Paul, one could say it is his first solo piece.  Cheeky.<br />This was one excellent album.  All four put their hearts and souls in this one, where they will remain for years to come.
0763611883|5.0|\\"I have this little sister, Lola.  She is small and very funny\\"  These opening lines set the sweet and gentle tone for a tale about two sisters.  One (Lola) with a very long list of foods she will not eat, and the other (Charlie) with the task of feeding dinner to her fussy little sister.<br />It could be a recipe for disaster -- I'm certain this situation would have played out quite differently with me and MY little sister -- but Charlie's creativity and sense of fun save the day.<br />My seven-year old fussy eater nearly fell out of his chair laughing when we read this book.  He clearly identified with, and enjoyed, Lola and her reasoning (for example, peas are \\"too small\\" and \\"too green\\").  While I'm pretty sure my son will not change his eating habits because of this story, it did give him a sense that he is not alone in the world with his funky tastes while reinforcing the idea that his tastes may change.<br />Great story, cute illustrations, good lesson.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I saw \\"The Two Towers\\" about two weeks ago and I have to say, I was not disappointed.  Never forget the incredible Battle of Helm's Deep, or the amazingly realistic Ents, or Samwise the Brave (long live Sam!).  My only problem was that they stopped the movie before Sam and Frodo meet Shelob; I was all ready to cry my eyes out!  Ah well, just a minor flaw in an otherwise awesome movie.  \\"The Two Towers\\" drew me right back into the story from the start, casting its magic spell with the first haunting notes of music.  From the first I was on the edge of my seat, wondering anxiously what would become of the Fellowship.  I was amazed by Gollum, how real and creepy -- and pitifully funny at times --  he was.  One minute he would be Stinker, with no thought other than killing Frodo to regain the Ring, and the next he would be Slinker, pathetically eager to please.  The debate between the two halves of Gollum's personality is guaranteed to send chills down your spine!<br />And now, to several hilights of the movie:  Treebeard the Ent caring for Merry and Pippin after their escape from the Orcs (yay for Pippin, who proves that he is no \\"fool of a Took\\"); the incredible Entish destruction of Isengard; Gimli's hilarious comments, which never failed to make me laugh; Aragorn's inspiring leadership; and of course, the deep friendship between Sam and Frodo, even when Frodo is under the Ringspell.  And kudos to Peter Jackson for an incredibly dramatic ending, with a twist that nobody (least of all me) could have anticipated.  Yes, it is much different than the book, but it's excellent nonetheless.  I won't reveal the details at risk of spoiling it, but let's just say that I was about to have a heart attack because of it!  Frodo never spoke truer words than these:  \\"[. . .]And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.\\"  See this movie; you won't be disappointed!  Bring on next December, and be prepared to bawl when you see the conclusion of this awesome adventure in \\"Return of the King!\\"<br />Long live the Halflings!

B00005JL78|1.0|I'm sorry, but this film did not live up to the hype. The special effects were plentiful in this movie, but I guess paying Tom Cruise ate into the budget a little bit because the CGI was sub-par.<br />The name of the film is probably the most ludicrous part. There is no mention of a &quot;Minority Report&quot; until half-way through the film. By the time it is mentioned, it isn't twenty minutes until you find out that there is no &quot;minority report&quot;. So the title has no bearing on the film to begin with.<br />This is a movie which owes it's success and hype to 1 thing...names. Tom Cruise, I mean come on. Who doesn't want to see a Tom Cruse movie? Well, not me anymore. And then there is Steven Speilberg...the man behind that lovable E.T....can't seem to churn out anything lately that is worth a hoot. This is truely a film on par with A.I.......hey, &quot;A.I&quot;, &quot;E.T&quot;, perhaps this should be called &quot;M.R.&quot; for the director's cut.<br />Save your money. If you must see it, wait for HBO.
B00006LPK5|1.0|I'll watch almost any kind of sci-fi or fantasy type movie, but Reign of Fire was a total waste of time.  Little plot/character development, cheap effects...the dragons should have been flying turkeys, because that's what this movie was!
0060523794|4.0|Two five - Durham, NC, an engineer<br />Read it!<br />I joined IBM two months before Gerstner and it needed a swift kick in the pants. I had a unique perspective coming out of graduate school because my dad work for Pan Am and we all know they went belly up. I was never going to depend on a company for my well being. Go to work do a great job and most of all save on your own and keep your skills current. I sensed a tremendous amount of entitlement amongst the employee ranks. I would have left in under a year if gerstner hadn't planted his foot in the rear end of this company. He made some decisions that many employees feel were unfair and unjust but if you look at our benefits package and perk system compared to many of our peers in industry it is still one of the best. We have more employees at IBM now then when he joined. Even after the big layoff. He was good for IBM. Is he a god of business? No... but all in all he was good for IBM.....<br />Every CEO makes too much money.  No one person is worth as much as many of our elite CEO's are being paid.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Has someone you don't like ever bossed you around? Or has anyone ever tortured you? Have you ever done anything with magic? Well, Harry Potter, the protagonist, has never played a sport while flying on a broomstick. He's never worn a cloak of invisibility, befriended a giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry has known is a miserable life with the Dursley's. Ever since Harry was a baby, he's woken up to Dudley's laughing, and his aunt's fist pounding on his door. Each day Dudley follows Harry around and tortures him. Harry's Aunt and Uncle boss him around, and Harry never plays any sports. He only goes to school, comes home, and gets bossed around some more. At school Harry doesn't even have any friends!<BR>             In the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, by J. K. Rowling, Harry's life changes suddenly.<BR>            On Harry's 11th  birthday he receives a mysterious letter from an owl messenger. Harry's Uncle Vernon finds the letter and rips it up before Harry can read it. As the week goes by, more letters come, and each time Uncle Vernon rips them up or burns them. On Sunday when no mail is supposed to come letters come flying through the house from everywhere. When Harry gets one, the letter is an invitation to a wonderful place he's never ever dreamed of. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him...If Harry can survive the encounter.
0316776963|5.0|I have found a new favorite author! Although I have never read any of his other books, I will be sure to now. Where do you start with a book that is funny all over!<br />Starting out at a young boy with a series of speech classes, to the unique and crazy family life, you will be giggling not only to yourself but loud enough for all around you to see and hear. If you are easily embarrassed in public...I would advise only reading this book at alone. You can not hold the laughter in. Moving on in the book it takes you through his college years and odd jobs...up to his move with his significant other to France.<br />Most favorite chapters would be \\"Big Boy\\", which is solely dedicated to a turd! Other chapters that were among my top picks were all the chapters regarding the move to France. David tries so hard to learn the language and battles with the sexes of all nouns.<br />David Sedaris is a brilliant author! I found myself reading bits and pieces of this book to friends and family...encouraging them to buy the book. I even bought the audio book as a xmas present for my mom.
B00006RCNW|4.0|I heard about \\"The Shield\\" from a friend at work, and the idea of Michael Chiklis, TV's \\"The Commish\\", as a bruising, corrupt but with a unique sense of justice cop seemed ludicrus.  Still, I turned in for the marathon that FX played right before the Season one finale, and I was hooked.  You see, it's not just Chiklis who makes this show work(he is incrdible, by the way, and by no means was his winning an Emmy a mistake), it's the entire cast and the way the show refuses to just focus on one part of life in the precient.  The show gives you four distinct storylines each week, and weaves them in and out over the course of the season.  Each storyline is engrossing, and each charachter played to perfection.<br />Chiklis is the obvious standout, and one of only two \\"name\\" actors on the show, the other being CCH Pounder.  Pounder has been a great B-list actress for years, and she's been given excellent material to work with, as the straight shooting but street-weary detective who is partnered up with a smart young detective who feels the need to prove himself to the veterans on the force, and is usually put through hell by Chiklis.<br />The other two story arcs involve a beat cop training a rookie with a secret he dare not reveal, and the new, politically abitious Captain, a young hispanic who was rose quickly through the ranks because he was young and hispanic.  He knows this, and wants to make a real name for himslef, and sets his sights on taking down Chiklis and his squad of corrupt yet oddly honorable cops.  That they end up working together as much as against each other is a testament to the ingenuity of the writers.<br />The season starts off hot, as we're introduced to the whole cast, and keeps getting tougher and more uncompromising as we learn more about the players.  Chiklis is a family man at heart, though he sleeps around.  CCH Pounder has lots of family issues, the young Detective goes through hell to solve cases, and it starts to affect him personally, and the Captain faces one problem after another, usually sparked by something Chiklis has done.  Was his promotion to this precient a pat on the back or a slap in the face?<br />All of this is portrayed brilliantly, and I heartily recommend the DVD if you've seen the show.  It is always rewatchable, and always tense, with a good sense of humor as well.  It will make you think and it will have you screaming in outrage.  TV hasn't been this good since \\"The Sopranos\\" started.and the Captain faces one problem after another, usually sparked by something Chiklis has done.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Let's put it this way. It doesnt really get much better than this. I could give you a detailed review but that would take away from the pure essence and immediacy of this album. The songs are beautifully structured, the lyrics are incredible and the songs and more specifically vocals create an exiciting journey that is just so friggin fun to go on. Chris Cornell is in top form and proves how he easily one of the most important artists of the last 20 years. He sounds incredibly fresh, the band sounds fresh as well. And to think this is only their first album. They all sound incredibly natural together too Brilliant songs, jaw dropping vocals and a lot of musical and vocal pleasure. Allows you to understand why you listen to music in the first place.<br />I strongly advise anybody who loves real music to get this album. Im sure youll love it so much ull be inspired to write your own review. Absoloutley brillant.
B00005R5G9|4.0|Those of you out there looking for a horribly deep movie won't bother with Mannequin, of course. My boyfriend laughs at me for stating it's one of my favorite movies of all time, but heck, what does he know?<br />It's campy, it's corny, it's oh-so-dated, but it's hilariously fun. 'Mannequin' is the story of an Egyptian princess (neat concept played fluffily well by Kim Cattrall) that is cursed to become a Mannequin unless she's in the presence of the person she chooses to reveal herself to. Andrew McCarthy is Jonathan, a down-on-his luck stockboy that's got a chance to make something of himself by helping decorate the storefront windows in a failing department store in NYC. That's where Cattrall's mannequin Emmy steps in, and the two fall in love (come on, you knew they would).<br />The fun thing about this movie is that it's chock full of 80's goodness. I'm not just talking the clothes or the music (though those are great too), I'm talking about the actors as well. Not only do you have 80's king Andrew McCarthy, but we have James Spader playing the slimy manager of a competing store, and GW Bailey (from the Police Academy movies) playing a slightly off-kilter security guard. Meschach Taylor almost steals the entire movie away with his portrayal of Hollywood Henderson, a flamboyant gay man with strange eyeglasses and a penchant to cry at the thought of True Love.<br />It's fun and fluffy overall, but it's entertaining. Those of you that saw it in the 80's will love the walk down memory lane. My only complaint (and why it didn't get 5 stars from me) is that the DVD is rather cheap. Cheap box, and zero extras. My advice is that if you just want it for a one time viewing, get the VHS. If you want it to add to your DVD collection, then get the DVD, because it's fairly reasonably priced.

B00005JLRR|4.0|Star Trek Nemesis is the tenth movie but only the fourth movie with the next generation crew. The crew is on their way to the home world of Counselor Troy to attend the wedding of Commander Riker and Troy when then get side tracked into investigating what their sensor pick up as a positronic being on another world. They then get invited to Romulus for talks.<br />Turns out it is all a ploy and the real reasons are uncovered by the crew. At this point all hell breaks loose. <br />The story line of the movie is very well done. But I think that the challenge of this adversary as challenging as say the Borg. The movie is very action packed but for being the last next generation movie I think that it could of ended it with a real challenge.

B00001PE4D|5.0|Kathryn Merteiul (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Philippe) have a challenge on their hands.  First, Kathryn's ex-boyfriend Court dumps her on accout that she's a bulemic headcase.  Kathryn then hires her stepbrother Sebastian to deflower Court's new fling Cecile (an idiotic Selma Blair), in turn coming back to Court to \\"deflower\\" him as well.  Second, Sebastian makes a bet with Kathryn that he can get into America's biggest prude's pants Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon). Kathryn excepts and if she wins, she gets his hot little car, and if he wins, he gets her (literally).  So a few lesbian kisses, crack sniffings, and arguments later Cecile finds that Sebastian gave her an orgasm, and Sebastian finds that he's in love with Annette.  When Kathryn finds this out she thinks she is betrayed and spreads a horrible romour about him to Ronald Clifford (Sean Patrick Thomas).  He and Sebastian's confrontation ends in disaster.  With an excellent ending and a wonderful performance from Ms. Gellar this flim is sheer fun.  With additional (basically) cameo performances from Joshua Jackson, Tara Reid, Swoosie Kurtz, and Christine Baranski, Cruel Intentions hits the mark.
B000003TA4|1.0|Touted by MTV as being the leaders of the american version of punk. MTV? Punk? There must be some sort of contradiction there. Anyway I got this CD listened to it once and never listened to it again. Must be the most boring CD I own and I own a few. If you think Nirvana's music is energetic then try listening to Nick Cave's &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; and then you'll understand what true rock music is but then again maybe you won't.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is awesome. Ever since Zack De La Rocha left Rage Against The Machine i was just mad because there was no more RATM. Now Audioslave i have been waiting a while to hear there stuff. Then the other day i went out and bought there CD and i was simply amazed. I would recommend this cd to anyone who like RATM or Soundgarden. My favorite song on this CD is &quot;Like A Stone&quot; this song is simply amazing this song is said to be dedicated to the late Alice In Chains singer Layne Staley and this song is just amazing. I dont think there is one song on this cd that is bad so i recommend that you go out and buy it.
B00005JLSC|5.0|CHICAGO is a movie adaptation of the musical by the same name. Hollywood has gambled in the last years by releasing two movie musicals (CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE) that will not \\"work\\" for every audience, but I can certainly say that it works for me! CHICAGO is a fun movie to watch and listen to and contains a spectacular cast.<br />Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is put in the Cook County Jail for murder. She eventually meets up with other women who have been charged with the same crime, most notably Vella Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who soon becomes her nemesis. Roxie dreams of becoming a star on the stage and manages to hire the notorious Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) to be her defense attorney and to persuade the jury that she is innocent.<br />The dialogue is witty and smart, and it was fun to watch all the signing and dancing. I am not normally a fan of musicals but I didn't mind this one at all. It is definately worth fighting the crowds to see CHICAGO this holiday season.
B00003CXCK|4.0|For a man who's made billions on sentimental and infantile Hollywood blockbusters, here Spielberg finally takes a shot at \\"serious\\" filmmaking and is finally rewarded at Oscar-time.<br />Liam Neeson puts in a fine performance as the central character, a master schmoozer/mannipulator German entrepreneur with a taste for women---the womanizing aspect lends some much-needed comic relief at several junctures of this 3 hour and 17 minute film.  The rest of the cast is also superb and well-directed, with a solid script, excellent camera work; the movie actually doesn't feel quite as long as it really is.<br />The last ten minutes is the only time the \\"old\\" Spielberg rears his ugly head again as he has Neeson breaking down in tears and rebuking himself for not saving even more Jews than he did (1100 roughly).  Let's hope that Neeson got a special bonus for having to act out such an embarassingly silly scene.  Luckily, this vintage Spielberg maudlin-excess is counterbalanced by the dark irony of a Russian soldier riding up to the newly freed Jews and proclaiming, \\"Congratulations, you have just been liberated by the Soviet Army!\\"  (That scene takes place in Czechoslovakia and when I first saw the film in a Prague cinema in 1994, the whole audience couldn't stop laughing.)<br />There is of course a subtle political agenda, too: asked where they should go now, the same Russian soldier answers, \\"Don't go east, they hate you there.  But don't go west.  If I were you, I wouldn't go west, either.\\"  A nice justification for the U.N.-decreed founding of the state of Israel in 1948 at the expense of oh, just a few million indigenous Arabs...<br />Otherwise, \\"Schindler's List\\" is a worthy film and nice history lesson.

But the finding are quite surprising - eg within occupations, choose dry cleaning but where are the property developers ?: in terms of ethnicity being scottish helps but where are the asian eg chinese/korean millionaires ?; finally where are the dot.com millionaires (I know the situation is different in 2003, but surely they were around when the book was published).<br />Certainly the findings would seem to merit a further study eg comparative studies from other industrialised countries (I wonder why no university researchers have done that ?).
B00007E8V4|5.0|If the songs on Steal This Album, which didn't make it onto System of a Down's first two albums, can be this good (which they are), then I'm afraid to hear their next album, because it's bound to only continue System's ascent.<br />System of a Down has maintained their signature sound.  this album is not vastly different in style, rather it's their style that each of the songs so different.  On top of that, unlike almost any other band who achieves this level of success, there is no crowd of imitators because no one else has been able to duplicate the sound.  The vocals drive the songs here, followed by the vigorous guitars and a rhythm section that keeps everyone guessing where the song will go next.  The end result is something like \\"so this is what would happen if Dr. Suess snapped & started a metal band\\"<br />Steal This Album is not nearly as polished as previous releases and the songs are much more abrupt, but that just adds to the mood of the album.  This album is a shoe-in to make my top 5 of 2002.
B00000JPHD|5.0|Classic chills in the hills of Transylvania! In my opinion, the newly added musical score is brilliant and raises this classic horror flick to 5 stars. Most everyone knows the story of Count Dracula, Renfield and Van Helsing, so I'll give viewers some little-known trivial fun. For years, the one thing this film lacked was an appropriate musical score, and after 6O-odd years, one was finally applied. Bela Lugosi created the role of Dracula on the American stage in 1927. Helen Chandler, who plays Mina was an original, eccentric and eventually tragic actress who succumbed to alcoholism. She was sometimes known as the actress with \\"stars for eyes\\". Chandler was cast in the memorable role of Nikki in fascinating THE LAST FLIGHT co-starring Richard Barthelmess the same year (1931). The part of Nikki was rather modern, kooky and bohemian for its day - her answer to any given question? \\"I'll take vanilla\\". Hopefully, it will make it to video one day. The sets for the inside of Dracula's rotting, instensely vile castle are even impressive by today's standards: very creepy. Universal bought the rights to the play and novel for $4O,OOO and one of the original script writers was Louis Bromfield. Karl Freud did NOT shoot the Spanish version (which many cite as being superior save the lead performance). Tod Browning has a bit as the Harbourmaster. Originally Van Sloan appeared in an afterword: he warned audiences that vampires do indeed exist. This novelty scene was omitted from prints in 1936. Lew Ayres and Robert Ames were originally deemed to play John Harker. The Spanish version opened in Havana 11 March 1931 to delighted Cuban moviegoers.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|From the opening sequence to the falling of the curtain, a masterpiece.  The music is intoxicating, drawing you into the  heart of the Moulin Rouge.  The images seduce you. Like the courtisans, Baz Luhrman makes you believe this is real.  You will be entertained.
B00005B36H|5.0|This CD is an awesome masterpiece to the people who look at it with an unobjectional view.  Forget about comparing it to \\"Nu Metal\\" \\"Grundge\\" blah blah.  Listen to it..just listen.  To many people, including me, the lyrics were hard to comprehend/interpret.  Maynard even said himself that the lyrics should be used to pertain towards your life, and to help others.  There is not 1 solid interpretation of the lyrics, and to the people who can't see beyond that then that's fine, it's their loss.  You can't force others opinions to change, you can only present it to them and see whether they will like it or not.  This pertains to the many people that reply to the 1 starred reviews. .... <br />Basically this is Tool's best CD because they've expanded their talents.  It seems the 5 years off and APC helped Maynard's vocals, because they sound great.  This CD has all you can ask for.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I have been a fan of System for a few years now, they have gone from hard, loud rock on their debut cd, to slower rock on Toxicity, and back to hard, loud rock on their new cd Steal This Album.  Most people think of them as just being loud and obnoxious, but what people don't know is that System has an amazing ability to create beautiful, soothing songs such as Ego Brain, Highway Song, and Roulette.  Though this cd has a different style than the other two it is definately much more than just a compilation of songs that haven't made it on the other two.<BR>  Armed with amazing lyricicst and poet Serj Tankian, musical genius Daron Malakian, heavy bassist Shavo Odadjian, and incredible drummer John Dolmayan.  System of a Down is more than just rock, they bring Eastern sounds into their music giving it a unique style that is impossible to recreate.  They have the talent to transfer ear splitting disonent chords into beautiful harmonic sounds.  <BR>  Even with the nice sounding songs don't let that fool you, if you don't like to hear other perspectives on life, religion, America, or cops I suggest you do not buy this cd.
B00005B36H|5.0|I'm not going to waste your time. I'm going to summarize this great album in a few sentences.<br />a). This is NOT an album for those with short attention spans. If you can't listen for 80 minutes without stopping, you won't be able to experience this album in its entirety, and I'm sorry for you.<BR>b). This album is NOT for the close-minded. It's fairly far outside the mainstream. If you are willing to give it a chance I gurantee you will love it.<BR>c). This album IS for those who love emotionally powerful, complex, original, and intelligent music.<br />Now, you can find poundingly heavy, angry metal, trippy prog, Middle-Eastern inspired raga, dark, hypnotic tribal, and fast, melodic hard rock on this CD in a variety of forms. This album will make you clench your fists and scream, it will make you see deeper into the workings of the universe, it will make you cry, smile (well, maybe a little), and it probably will make you wake up hearing \\"aliens\\" (I had no idea that there was a hidden track, and consequentially I woke up in a cold sweat (at least I hope it was sweat) if you are not careful. And you don't even need drugs. Close the blinds, ask not to be disturbed, shut out the light, lie down in bed, put it on and if you are reasonably intelligent these things and more will occur, plus a lot of amazing mental imagery. Have fun, ask questions, listen to it until your ears bleed and you will see the culimination of all the great prog, metal, rock, and world musicians rolled into one LP. Happy trippin's.

Repeat the above seven-thousand times and you have the whole move. No need to waste any time watching it.
0316666343|2.0|The reason I bought this is because of a review I heard on NPR stating this was one of the year's best novels.  It makes me rethink my annual donation to public radio.  It is easy reading and is written from a unique perspective but has an absurd endinging and underdeveloped characters.  You should feel sorry for the mother in the story bc she has lost her child instead I thought she should have stayed in her minimum wage job in Napa after deserting her family.  The ending was ridiculous with the Susie's reinactment of Ghost where Demi Moore invades Whoopie Goldberg's body.  Then the piece de resistance is when the murderer is killed by the icicle.  Give me a break.  I have never been so interested in selling something on eBay.
B00006CXXU|5.0|and we should thank her. This album is a complete turn around from her first, a collection of Bubble Gum dance tunes and ballads supported by her incredible voice. On Stripped she does not use her voice as a crutch but rather a compliment to the amazing honesty in the lyrics. Stripped has something for everyone, from the latin inspired \\"Infatuation\\" to the bluesy \\"Walk Away,\\" to \\"Make Over\\" which almost has Christina crossing in to rock territory. Produced by some of the most talented artists of the decade (Alicia Keys and Rockwilder) this album has pure soul, grit, and- dare I say it: depth. A definate must have for any pop collector
B00006NSZ5|3.0|This is DEFINITELY not the \\"best soundtrack ever,\\" as some kids might suggest.  Believe me, there's much much much more to hip-hop than this movie soundtrack.  Anyway, you can't fade \\"Wanksta\\" from 50 Cent (this joint is without a shadow of a doubt the best cut on this soundtrack) and there's no stopping Gangstarr on his joint either.  Either way, it makes for a cool listen even though (unfortunately) it seems as if radio stations appeal more to Eminem's played-out cuts off the soundtrack rather than the other artists, but it's all good...that's how commercial hip-hop works.<BR...  ...
0786868694|5.0|A lot has been said about Nigella Lawson's casual and conversational approach to writing her cookbooks, but I was still pleasantly surprised at how easy this book (and her others) was to read and to use as a tool.<br />She makes so many good points about the pleasures and perils of cooking, but her \\"just give it a shot\\" attitude and unapologetic style make you WANT to go in the kitchen and give things a try.<br />The only negative is that most of the recipes in here are high in starch and/or fat, but for those who eat for enjoyment and just want a fun and rewarding experience both in AND out of the kitchen, this is your book...
B000050IE6|5.0|Opeth is definitely an unusual animal in the world of metal. The exercise of labeling them is probably futile; they incorporate a wide variety of sounds and ideas into their music, and blend them all seamlessly to concoct a wonderful and rich atmosphere.<br />Still Life is simply amazing from every perspective. From the subdued, barely audible intro of the first song on, you can tell you've found something special and unique. The intense, powerful moments of their music naturally transform into soft, calm interludes, with vocals that can go from a harsh and demonic growl to an angelical whisper in seconds, creating a contrast that engulfs you in the atmosphere of the whole album. This is one of those CDs that won't allow you to just casually listen to one of the songs; you'll be craving for more, and before you know it, you'll get through the entire album. Godhead's Lament and Face of Melinda are the two songs that I like the best, but the truth is there is no song that really sticks out. The whole album is consistently great.<br />If you liked any other Opeth release, then you will definitely like this one. If you've never heard these guys, but you're looking for something original, intense, heartfelt and intelligent, then this is a pretty good place to find it.
B000066NW0|5.0|From the time I first heard &quot;Complicated,&quot; I knew I wanted this CD. Something about that song really got to me. Then, about a week ago, I received this CD for Christmas, but didn't really get a chance to listen to it until yesterday. After listening to it just ONE time through, it EASILY became my new favorite CD. Just like that--that's how good it is. One time through and I'm hooked. Then today, I listened to it a few more times through and I love it even more. My favorite songs are &quot;Anything But Ordinary,&quot; &quot;Things I'd Never Say,&quot; and &quot;My World.&quot; One thing I really didn't expect from this CD was how much acoustic guitar there is on it. Personally, I think it really compliments her outstanding vocal abilities, but I can see why punk music fans would call her a poser and why they'd hate her for it. I wouldn't call this a punk CD by any means, so if that's what you're into, do us all a favor and stick to your own genre--don't diss ours.
B00004XONN|5.0|Where is the music going in the 21st century? It seems that the twentieth saw the majority of great songs written, so the boundaries must be pushed further by means of other devices. Radiohead's revelation &quot;Kid A&quot; shows the musical genius now lies mainly in sonic experimentation and surprising use of more conventional means of expression.<br />There is something compellingly beautiful about this album, although its mood is rather dark than bright. Each and every song is different from one another, but the collection holds together quite well.<br />&quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; would be the suitable title for the album -- this opening track transcendingly moves the listener to the planet where anything is possible, where no objections even against the cacophony of &quot;The National Anthem&quot; (how ironic!) are raised. Meanwhile, you find out the &quot;Kid A&quot; to be a quiet tune, with a wonderful mid-section washing over your ears. After trying &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; (a good attempt, yet with guitars betraying the older Radiohead), &quot;Treefingers&quot; touch your face freezingly, but you get back to life with &quot;Optimistic&quot;, the most straightforward song on the album. Being &quot;In Limbo&quot; is not that bad either and don't forget to visit &quot;Idioteque&quot;, one of the most memorable tracks here, with pounding beats going to your head. The end of the journey continues on electronica wave, with somewhat calmer &quot;Morning Bell&quot; and &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; which tries to persuade you 'you're crazy, baby'. This time, don't believe.<br />Do you think you will wish to see your kid a often? I bet you do. Without trying to find deeper meanings inside, this music is enthralling and downright good. And yes, very listenable.
0316666343|1.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about.  It took me a long time to get past the first couple pages, not a very interesting subject matter, the killing of an innocent girl.  Very cryptic.  I found the description of heaven to be enchanting. The ending was VERY disappointing, nothing really happened to George Harvey, he was stabbed by a icicle?????  I wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE with a young girl, too disturbing.  This book will go to the garbage bin before I give it out to anyone.
B00006CXXU|5.0|What can I say? I have been a fan from the beginning. I liked the first CD, but I LOVE this one. Christina's pop image obviously didn't suit her and you could tell in interviews. She was forced into the same image that girls her age are placed into. She had to do the bubblegum pop thing in order to put her foot in the door... now she's HERE. If you read interviews now, you'll see her say that if she had to do another album like her first one she'd quit - I would too, if I were her. Listen to the song Make Over, it's about how the industry tried to make her be something she's not (\\"I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over I just wanna live simple and free\\"). Every single song is a reflection of who she is and what she's been through. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" is a slap in the face to those who've insulted her (Eminem), \\"Walk Away\\" shows the trouble with loving someone who you shouldn't, \\"Fighter\\" is a truly empowering song that makes you feel like nobody can break you, \\"Infatuation\\" is a great testimonial about latin men, \\"Impossible\\" was not my favorite but it's nice, a bit repetitive, \\"Underappreciated\\" I love it cause it explains how relationships fizzle and one person gets walked on...ok basically all of it rocks and you must hear \\"I'm Ok\\" because it truly reveals Christina in a way that we haven't gotten to see her. You get to see where she comes from, her emotions, it's a raw song. It's GREAT!
B000000H4V|4.0|This album represents the transition beetween old-style Sepultura and more mainstream Sepultura. Up until Arise, the band cultivated a sound that was closer to classic 80s thrash, but with these release, they started experimenting a little bit, slowing down the tempos and even incorporating some Brazilian folk elements into their music, as they would brilliantly move on to do in Roots. And even though they did, in a way, make a move towards a more &quot;mainstream&quot; sound, they didn't lose their edge and power.<br />I gave this album only four stars not because it's not good enough, but because compared to other Sepultura releases, I feel something is missing with this one. It has some great songs, but also some that are somewhat lackluster. The power is there the whole time, but the magic of Beneath the Remains or Arise is only present at certain moments of the record. Still, this is a great album, and no metal collection is complete without it. Some of their most popular songs are here, such as Refuse/Resist and Territory.
B00007BH5C|5.0|First of all, being Canadian myself, I was overjoyed to see that Canadian/Armenian soprano ISABEL BAYRAKDARIAN was featured in Howard Shore's score for Two Towers!! Her debut CD called \\"Joyous Light\\" on the CBC label (available through Amazon.com) is basically an extended version of the glorious chant-style she exudes on the LOTR track called \\"Evenstar.\\" If you haven't picked up this brilliant young soprano's CD, then you are missing out. She has a mystical, meditative purity in her voice, and has the ability to transport you to a place of peace and serenity.<br />As for the rest of the soundtrack, I'm speaking as a professional orchestral percussionist -- BRAVO to Mr. Shore for his fantastic use of percussion instruments! I only hope that someday I may have the pleasure of performing his orchestral music live.
6304057709|5.0|How can a romantic comedy about seeking marriage mates win the Berlinale, one of the most prestigious film festivals? Well, this splendid adaptation of a classic Jane Austen novel did just that in 1996, combining fabulous writing (and acting) of Emma Thompson and great directing of Ang Lee (\\"The Wedding Banquet\\", \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\").<br />Other performances are also first-class. Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant shine (personally, I've never seen a role to be so fitting for Grant, although \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" and \\"About a Boy\\" came close). The whole cast is flawless.<br />When the film came out, even the self-proclaimed film saviour Quentin Tarantino could not help himself but quip: \\"Who the F... is Jane Austen?\\" Yes, this English author who lived 200 years ago wrote only romantic novels about girls (and men) who are in want of a spouse. But she achieved perfencion in this very limited space (the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is probably the best). In this movie, the very human side -- the desire not to be alone, to spend a lifetime with the One -- is described with power. Finding the true love was the prime thing for the two Dashwood sisters. But, is it still not true for most of us, even in this cold, material world?<br />Emma Thompson, already an Oscar winner for her leading role in \\"Howards End\\" (1992), won the Oscar for this film's adapted screenplay, becoming the first artist ever to achieve such a feat -- winning the Academy Awards for both acting and writing.<br />Apart from saving all important aspects of the story, Thompson included very poignant and sharp moments in the script. When her character Elinor and Edward Ferrars (played by Grant) are on a cruise ride, she says, 'you inherit your money. We cannot even make it,' hinting at the situation of middle class women two centuries ago, when their fortunes depended heavily either on inheritance from father or property of husband -- and it was imaginable they should go to work.A great social commentary.<br />Beatifully shot, with delicate music score by Patrick Doyle, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is predominantly an entertaining film. But its social and human undertones are undeniable. It did win Berlin festival and the Golden Globe, but lost the Oscar race to \\"Braveheart\\". Maybe for the lack of great human topic that would rank it along \\"Schindler's List\\" or \\"The English Patient\\". Yet I feel that there was not the film in 1995 to deserve the big Oscar more than this one.<br />If you have sense and sensbility, you will laugh and you will cry. This is a film to love.
B000002KCF|5.0|I was riding along in my car one day when I heard Popsicle Toes, and I immediately fell in love with the song. From that moment on I have attempted to colledt as much Michael Franks material as possible.  After teh song went off the radio I immediately tried to make sure I caught the name of the song.  As soon as I got home I went online to try and find the name of the artist who produced this masterpiece.  After one listen I knew I was in heaven and since that time Michael Franks has been my favorite artist and this remains my favorite CD.  This CD is refreshing and provides listners with a glimpse of a wide range of emotions.  Franks does receive the credit he deserves.  I can't wait to see him live.  Every chance I have had I have had to miss him for unfortunate reasons.  I am looking forward to seeing him live. This CD is the pick me up when I am down and refreshing when I am i the best of moods. This is an excellent pick for all ages.
B00006EXL5|1.0|At the top of the emo/indie/punk genre you'll find the bands that not only write great songs, but do it in interesting and innovative ways. Braid, Rainer Maria, The Jazz June, etc. Then there's those bands that really have no interesting ideas, but are perhaps worth listening to for the catchiness in their simplicity. Saves The Day, Taking Back Sunday, etc. Then there's the absolute dregs of the genre. Bands like My Chemical Romance, who not only are completely formulaic and boring, but can't even write a catchy hook. I don't understand why anyone would want to listen to this record.

0316666343|1.0|I was completely disappointed in this book that had received so much hype.  I was reluctant to read it at first because in my job as a defense attorney, I deal with many child abuse cases and didn't relish reading a book that would deal so personally with the child's death.  But, after reading so many rave reviews for the book, I gave in.  Alice Sebold certainly had a clever idea for her story, and could have used it to explore real human emotions and the dynamics of the family, but instead she squandered her opportunity and ended up with a ridiculous, improbable and immature revere on retribution/fulfillment from the grave.  Don't waste your time.
B000002JS0|5.0|People may rant and rave about Back in Black or Highway to Hell, but it's lesser known albums like High Voltage that often get ignored because everyone jumps on the mainstream bandwagon. Don't get me wrong, BIB and HTH are fantastic albums, but some of AC/DC's finest work was done in relative obscurity before their big U.S. breakthrough in those aforementioned albums. And their debut with High Voltage was just awesome. Here are my breakdowns of each song:<BR>1. It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock and Roll): and AC/DC classic, and one of my favourite songs by them. The guitar riff is a little repetitive, but by no means detracts from the song. The bagpipes are a spectacular addition to this song.<BR>2. Rock and Roll Singer: a very similar song to It's a Long Way to the Top, but forgivable as this is one of Bon's finer moments as far as lyrics go.<BR>3.The Jack: an in-concert favourite. I don't particularly care for this song, but the ingenious double entendres are always entertaining to listen to.<BR>4. Live Wire: my favourite AC/DC song. From the pounding, regimented bass line at the opening, to Angus' wonderful guitar work, to Bon's fine lyrics, this is a joy to listen to and never gets tiring for me. By far the highlight of the album.<BR>5. TNT: another AC/DC masterpiece and deservedly so. The guitar riff is very catchy, and soon you'll be pounding your head up and down with the beat and screaming &quot;OI!OI!OI!&quot; with the band.<BR>6. Can I Sit Next To You Girl: This song and Little Lover are the two songs on this disc that could be considered &quot;filler&quot; but are by no means exercises in tedium to listen to.<BR>7. Little Lover: similar to the Jack. Gets down to AC/DC's blues roots. As I stated earlier, this is nothing but filler.<BR>8. She's Got Balls: I love the intro to this song, and the rest of the song follows along quite nicely. Not up there with the best of this album, but those are very lofty standards and thus this is still a very good song.<BR>9. High Voltage: a lot of people love this song, although I'm not one of them. It's a good song for sure, but pales in comparison to Live Wire, TNT and It's a Long Way to the Top. Nonetheless, you'll still be singing &quot;High Voltage rock n' roll!&quot;<BR>If this review made it seem like this album is not one of the finest pieces of rock ever assembled, my apologies, because it is! Live Wire is, in my opinion, worth the purchase price alone and TNT doesn't hurt its cause either. This is truly and essential part of your AC/DC collection.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|They should add a sixth star just for this album alone. Absolutely incredible album. Their best in years. Bruce Dickinsons voice hasn't sounded this good in a long time. in fact the entire band sounds revitalised by his return to the fold. Bringing Adrian Smith back into the mix while keeping Janick Gers on board was absolutely brilliant. The three guitars gives it a thicker heavier sound. it's heavy enough to attract outside listeners while still sounding like Maiden. Nicko McBrain proves he's one of the greatest drummers of all time. ... the entire band proves they're some of the greatest musicians of all time. This should more than please longtime listeners. The companion live cd Rick in Rio is also a must have. With all this talk of the Rolling Stones world tour (who's only decent song by the way is an ancient tune called satisfaction) where is Iron Maidens recognition? Here they are 26 years into their careers and releasing one of their best (if not their best)  ... . UP THE IRONS BABY!!!!!
0783211856|5.0|Schindler's List is probably one of the most powerful and disturbing movie in the history of movies. This movie is not intended for children. But, the older ones may find this movie interesting as well as disturbing and sad. <BR> This movie tells the story of one mans fight for freedom for the Jews. It tells the true story of what happened during the Holocaust. I would recommend this film for anyone who likes history.
B000003TAR|5.0|Not many bands can acomplish what Nirvana did with In Utero. Every Nirvana album has a unique sound but In Utero has the best by far. It is rawer and more poetic than Nevermind but not as heavy as Bleach. No band in the history of Rock And Roll has created an album as good as In Utero and probably never will. Every song from Serve The Servents to All Apologies is a masterpiece that it is a shame that they don't rename it Nirvana's Best. It shows the mood of Kurt Cobain in his last days. There is no bad song on this CD so how can it not be the greatest. Kurt Cobain, Krist Novasellic, and Dave Grohl have done greater than the Rock and Roll legends Led Zepplin The Beatles and Black Sabbath with this album. It is almost sad to listen to because of nowing about Kurt Cobain's horrid death.

B000000W5P|3.0|This cd has three good songs and several not very good songs. It was a major part of the seventies, so if you were plugged in then you probably like it more than is justified. There are at least 5 Stone albums to get before this, especially with the recent remasters of the earlier albums.
B000002UW1|3.0|Yes, this is perhaps one of REM's finest. As far as REM goes it contains some very \\"new\\" material for them, circa. 1987. Or does it? <br />I was 18 when this record came out, and after hearing the first 20 seconds of \\"It's the end of the world\\" I was practically falling out of my chair with sympathetic embarrassment for the \\"intellectuals\\" around me who mimicked the lines and truly thought it genius.  <br />I said it in '87 and i'll say it again, Bob Dylan did this song in 1966. It was called Subterranean Homesick Blues, and although the actual lyric was different and the arrangement was folk-ish, it was DYLAN who was the creative genius here, not Stipe. <br />Sure, REM's hit has a catchy fun sense to it, and i don't dislike the song at all. But to call them somehow pioneering in their music is a slap in the face to so many other sounds that came before them. Perhaps if listeners would open their collective ears they's know that REM was a great band, but far from the musical pioneers they are touted as.  Go buy Document for your collection, it's good music for 1987, and thats about it.
B0000035E7|4.0|Each of Nirvana's albums have a unique sound to them, and Bleach's is the heaviest of them all. This is grunge in all of it's forms. Heavy, raw, angry, and depressed. Although it is not Nirvana's best album it does deserve alot of credict for laying the tracks down for the soon to be legendary Nirvana. It explains the depressed mood of Kurt Cobain. The lyrics are powerful and the sounds of this album is almost as good as Nevermind. It is only missing one thing Dave.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Stephen Merrit is a GREAT song writer.<BR>   Love is sad, stupid, funny, cruel, cutting, hysterical and...<BR>   It has been several years since I have purchased music of this quality and integrity-it is a rare find.<BR>   It's worth the price of admission just to have the song &quot;Love Is Like A Bottle Of Gin&quot;<BR>   Have fun. XO
0790729350|4.0|A previous reviewer has made mention of the fact that so much of the best music from the concert doesn't appear in the documentary footage.  I concur, and I advise anyone who owns the motion picture to buy the soundtrack as well.  There were tremendous performances by Sly and the Family Stone, Paul Butterfield, Melanie, Mountain, Johnny Winter, Creedence Clearwater Revival and others that ended up on the cutting room floor.  Time couldn't possibly allow all three days' worth of music, but the film was about so much more than the musical performances.  <br />Aside from the atrocious weather that plagued the event, some of the performances were awful, including the Who's set, which sounded like they were playing in a cardboard box; Arlo Guthrie's, who stormed off in anger after constant helicopter interruptions; CSNY's, with their out-of-tune guitars and off-key vocals; and the Grateful Dead's (absent from both the film and the soundtrack), which ended when a rain-soaked Jerry Garcia was electrocuted by a mike-stand.  Ironically, the thrilling conclusion to the festival, given by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, was witnessed by only a few thousand stragglers, as many people had already gone home -- or never even made it to the show because of all the abandoned cars on the highways.<br />Some very poignant and very human moments were included in the film, especially those with the chief of police and the Port-o-San cleaner, as well as some difficult moments, such as the irate farmer who lost his milk supply and had his fences broken due to the massive crowds and blocked highways(\\"It's a sh*tty mess!\\" he says).  Joan Baez' protest-laden set was equally poignant, and Country Joe MacDonald's exhortation \\"How do you expect to stop a war if you don't sing?!?\\" epitomizes the attitude of the Nation's youth towards an unpopular conflict and \\"the establishment.\\"<br />Most wonderful in all the film were the interviews with festival-goers and the impromptu stage announcements, interspersed between the concert footage and the stylistic, multi-screened editing.  How they managed to dub all those various performance clips with the soundtrack is amazing in itself.<br />This tremendous work of art won an Academy Award, and gives great snapshots of popular culture of the late 1960's.  It's an important piece of American film and also of American history.  But once again, if you really want to experience the MUSIC, buy the film AND the soundtrack.
B000069AUI|5.0|I didn't think it was possible but this is the perfect follow up to their first album. A Rush of Blood to the Head is up there with the very best, such as Radiohead and U2. My favorite songs are 'Politik', 'In My Place' &amp; 'clocks'. Keep up the good work!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I have heard both T.a.T.u. Cd's. The Russian version and english CD. They are both awesome. They have nice voices and the sound is great.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has a great voice her new cd is a lot different from the other one. a lot more coming from the heart and working with a lot of good people like lil kim and A. Keys. It has a little bit of hip-hop, r&amp;b and spanish music all in this cd. I dont recmond this Cd for guys. Its more girl power cd. Over all its a great cd.
B00002E23E|5.0|I never got a chance to see zeppelin live, so to me, this was a great chance. The beginning is a little weird, but hey, its zeppelin, thats to be expected. I thought the 30 min. Dazed and Confused was great. I have the shortened version on Zeppelin 1, and I've always wanted to hear the full length song. This is a must have for all zeppelin fans. The music is great, the band is great, and you get to see zeppelin live, you can't get any better than that. If you don't have this DVD, get it!
B00005JKDR|5.0|I was unsure when purchasing this as to whether it was going to be too childish, but I can't seem to stop watching it. I love the characters, the story line, but most of all the attention to detail in animation. This is an instant classic. But I'm sure you already know that !
B00006RU5B|5.0|Let's put it this way. It doesnt really get much better than this. I could give you a detailed review but that would take away from the pure essence and immediacy of this album. The songs are beautifully structured, the lyrics are incredible and the songs and more specifically vocals create an exiciting journey that is just so friggin fun to go on. Chris Cornell is in top form and proves how he easily one of the most important artists of the last 20 years. He sounds incredibly fresh, the band sounds fresh as well. And to think this is only their first album. They all sound incredibly natural together too Brilliant songs, jaw dropping vocals and a lot of musical and vocal pleasure. Allows you to understand why you listen to music in the first place.<br />I strongly advise anybody who loves real music to get this album. Im sure youll love it so much ull be inspired to write your own review. Absoloutley brillant.
B0000640VN|4.0|Revolving around a time portal off the Brooklyn Bridge, romance ensues between Kate and Leopold.  Her of market research butter fame and he of royalty, desparate for funds.<br />This is the axis for the flick. You can see what's coming, out of another era falling in love with the aggressive woman who is jolted out of her time by his sincerity and class.<br />All in all an enjoyable watch.
B00003CXV4|5.0|This movie is the best romantic comedy that i have seen in awhile. you have got to see this movie. i love it!
B00005O3VC|5.0|This ingenius (but slap-stick) comedy is a classic. I have seen the film/video/DVD dozens of times--which probably makes me &quot;unworthy&quot; to truly rate this production, at least in the eyes of those who have seen it HUNDREDS OF TIMES. No doubt those who saw it once and didn't like it--and if you are in this category, shame on you!--they would likely think I was a &quot;loony&quot; for seeing it so many times. I can't tell you how many times lines from this flick have served the purpose of livening up or changing the dull atmosphere of a party; and for those who know what I'm talking about, part of the fun is suffering through the mostly dreadful attempts at doing a British accent.<br />One of my favorite scenes, among many (and pardon the paraphrase for those who have the script memorized WordPerfect): &quot;A creature so foul, so perverse, so TOTALLY cruel, that no man has gone against him yet and lived. Follow, BUT . . . .&quot;<br />Now a trivia question, to which I don't have the time to find the answer--I could swear, from my earliest recollections, that the title originally was: &quot;Monty Python's 'In Search of the Holy Grail'.&quot; Is my memory wrong? Can anyone help me out here?
B00003CWL6|5.0|When my best friend asked me to see this movie in the theater, I must say that I was reluctant to see it. Needless to say, I returned to the theater 5 times to see it again. I cried every time. This film has truly touched my soul. And I can honestly say it has changed my life. It has a great story, and it is full of meaning, Kevin Spacey is incredible. When the movie recieved all the Oscars my eyes filled with tears. American Beauty is my all time favorite movie. I am the proud owner of the DVD and the screenplay! PLEASE see this movie!! It is out of this world.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I've heard a lot of fans say that this is a bad &quot;No Doubt&quot; album because it doesn't sound just like the last album. But people change, grow, and mature and it shows in their music.  You can't listen to songs like &quot;Hella Good&quot; or &quot;Hey Baby&quot; without thinking ska, and ska and reggae influence the rest of the CD to greater or lesser extent, depending on the song.  Their musicianship has definitely improved, they seem to love the music they put on this CD, and it is bouncy, happy ska-influenced music.  What could be more NoDoubt than that?  Albums that all sound the same are BORING -- this CD is definitely not that!  If you weren't a No Doubt fan before, listen to this and you probably will be.  It is a wonderful CD for all listeners of modern music, and should be taken as a brand new No Doubt that has grown up a little but hasn't lost it's ska or punk roots.  After all, what's more punk than playing what you want to play and shocking all your fans? I highly recommend this CD!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I always thought that R.A.T.M. was a kick a** band with the worst lead 'singer' in the world, (come on y'all, admit it, after about 2 songs of Zach DeLa Rocha's tuneless ranting weren't you ready to just rip your hair out?) but if Tom Morello and Co. ever hooked up with a real singer, they could do some serious damage! Well that glorious day has finally arrived in the form of Audioslave (I personally don't think the name is that corny)and the results are nothing less than astonishing! The LP opens with the [hard]-slap attack of \\"Cochise\\" and never lets up from there. These 4 men simply belong together and create some of the heaviest, catchiest and dopest hard rock I've heard in quite a while. Chris Cornell has lost of his banshee wailing power from his Soundgarden days and while this LP lacks the artsy pretensions of say, \\"Superunknown\\" or Cornell's own \\"Euphoria Morning\\", the lyrics are some of his best and the guitar playing here will have you slapping your dashboard in utter disbelief!<br />Everything here is worth repeated listening and will most likely still sound fresh 15 or 20 years from now.<br />A great debut and here's hoping that this isn't a one shot project for these guys.
B00006RU5B|4.0|When I first heard the song Cochese on the radio, I loved it. When I got the whole CD, I was a little disapointed. Some of the songs are good, hard music like Rage Against The Machine used to do. But alot of the tracks on it are slower songs. I thought it would be faster, &amp; more like Rage because it's bascically all the same people, besides the vocalist from Rage. Well, this CD is good though, for the few songs that are more rock, it makes up for the slow ones!
B000066NW0|5.0|If you liked any of the singles Avril has released off of this CD so far, then definitely pick up this album. You will be amazed by how good the rest of the songs are. She could release any of the songs on this album and have it be an instant smash. The types of songs she peforms range from pop-oriented tracks to true rock tracks. But throught the whole album all of the songs are held together by her definitive attitude. Anyone can relate to the songs on this album. Avril is the &quot;it&quot; girl right now and &quot;Let Go&quot; is the reason why.
B000021YQV|5.0|Wow! When I first popped this cd into my stereo, I was amazed! I didn't think a CD could ever be so great! Right from the start, their first song &quot;Prison Song&quot; gets you going right away!As you move to track number six, &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, it makes you jump around! All of the tracks on this CD are great. Most CDs have about 3/4 or 1/2 of good songs, then a few are bad, but not System! ALL of the songs are great! System has tied for first place on my top list with Rage Against The Machine. The two best groups ever, none of either groups have any songs that'll let you down. If your looking for a CD that's just awesome, buy System of a Down! This music will make your head bobb for the whole CD!
B00004T9UF|5.0|THis is my favriote eminem album. It is jsut perfect, ive had it for nearly 2 years and im still not sick of it.<BR>My favriote songs are who knew, which is about how he claims he enver knew he would turn out this way, Marshal Mathers, basically a story of his life with a little bit of ICP dissing. And Criminal, umm....fantasy. Overall i think you should buy this if you like eminem. It doesnt paint real nasty images either =)
B00007E8J8|4.0|The cd is really great. Is sounds better than the last. she takeing everything to a new level.
0446310786|5.0|Simply a great book. Funny, frightening, sad, hopeful, and wonderous.
6305232660|5.0|The way I see it, there's a lot of Biblical stuff woven into this film.<BR>(1) The comet that's supposed to destroy the earth could symbolize the Fallen Angel. The ancient Hebrews sometimes referred to angels as stars, comets or other heavenly bodies.<BR>(2) The crew that's supposed to save the earth could symbolize the Messiah Himself. Just as the original Messiah died so that the world might live, these astronauts sacrificed themselves for the future of our planet.<BR>(3) President Morgan Freeman affirms his belief in God and blesses the nation with a prayer.<BR>(4) Reporter Tea Leoni makes peace with those who have hurt her before she dies.<BR>Whether or not it was director Mimi Leder's intention, this is a story with a very Christian theme.
B00006LSCX|5.0|The original CD released a year ago was already a piece of pop masterpiece in recent years. A great dance pop album that leaves you prancing and dancing all night long.<br /><br />Everything from straight pop to electronic to high energy dance. Look out for the re-issue which includes a second bonus CD of mostly remixes. Although this is admittedly a last ditch attempt to milk more money from the Fever mania, it is by no means subpar. The reason being that the six remixes are some of the best Kylie has to offer and from the past year. There's the clever amalgamation of Blue Monday and Can't Get You Out of My Head, the club favorites from Roger Sanchez's Release The S-Man Dub of In Your Eyes, Scrumfrog's dub of Love At Fiirst Sight and the phenomenal Fischerspooner mix of Come Into My World. Flowing seamlessly from one mix to another, the bons CD ends with the Scooby Doo soundtrack song Whenever You Feel Like It.<br /><br />Though you might have the original Cd, you just have to get the re-issue! Clever marketing but ultimately worth your every cent!
B00006HBUB|5.0|This movie was totally and absolutely awesome.I was in the theatre with a bunch of little kids and I lauphed more than they did.I recommend this movie to anyone who has the intellogence of a 5 year old.
