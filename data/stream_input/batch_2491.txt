B008Y5OWMK|1.0|Well, first of all...the first twenty minutes and the last five could be removed from the film and no one would know the difference.  That's just for starters.  Anyone that's seen the film will know what I'm talking about.  The movie doesn't adhere to what editors call 'falling action.'  We want to get into a scene late, and get out early.  This movie doesn't take this into consideration.  The sheriff will ride up to the saloon, get off his horse, tie his horse down, and walk into the saloon.  There are parts where people are getting dressed that take up two to three minutes.  Pointless scenes and almost every scene is at least a few minutes too long.  Whole chunks of this movie can be removed and the audience wouldn't even notice.  Not to mention the plot revolves around immigrants being hunted down in the West.  Well, the immigrants speak in a foreign language and it's never translated.  That's fine, but they have town debates in another language that last for about ten minutes.  Totally pointless for anyone that doesn't speak German.  Also, I found myself rooting for the bad guys.  I never could connect with the plight of the immigrants because I couldn't understand them nor knew their names.  They were just the 'abused' people that I was supposed to root for.  No thanks.  Will all the talent and money wasted on this film already, please don't spend your hard earned dollars wasting one more penny on this boring piece of schlock.  I'm serious folks, it's THAT bad.

B004EQAVHI|2.0|Having read and reread Kazuo Ishiguro's profound, beautifully written novel Never Let Me Go, I had been intrigued by the recent film adaptation, especially by the mixed reviews and the \\"love it or hate it\\" attitude most people seemed to take with the film.  Recently I decided to take the plunge and just watch the thing myself.  I approached it with a sort of wariness, curiosity, and hope - hope that, like so many books-turned-to-film, it would not end up simply being a washed out, hollow version of a meaningful story.<br /><br />Never Let Me Go tells the tale of three children - Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth - growing up together in a boarding school in alternate England in the 1970's.  It is a story told through Kathy's eyes in three parts, the first being the Hailsham years, the second being the time spent at the Cottages as young adults, and the third being Kathy's years as a carer.  However, this is by no means a quaint story about ordinary boarding school children.  Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth - along with all the other students at Hailsham - are clones whose chief purpose in life is to reach healthy maturity in order to donate their vital organs.  The students at Hailsham are sheltered enough to know that they are \\"special\\", but nothing beyond that.  As Miss Lucy, one of the teachers, puts it, \\"The problem is, you've been told and not told.  You've been told, but none of you really understand.\\"  Only when she and Tommy fall in love and Ruth completes on her third donation does Kathy truly realize how their lives have been shaped beyond their control.  Never Let Me Go paints a gentle, understated picture of the fragility of life and what it means to be human.<br /><br />Cloning is a common concept in the science fiction genre, but Never Let Me Go molds it into something different, something beyond the average sci-fi action adventure plot line.  In fact, there is nothing remotely \\"action adventure\\" about this story.  We are not told of Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth's desire to escape their surroundings and revolutionize their world.  There are no daring midnight runs or police chases, no cold interrogation cells.  That is not the point.  Instead, Ishiguro chooses to integrate simple, everyday concepts - a music tape, a ball game on a muddy field, childhood whisperings at bedtime, rain on a windowsill - into the lives of his characters.  We understand their hopes, disappointments, and dreams.  We watch them rage and cry and fall in love.<br /><br />I wondered in particular how this understated approach would translate to film... and came away with mixed feelings.  As an art piece, Never Let Me Go was absolutely lovely.  Through the camera, the muted colors and lush, green, overcast English countryside were breathtaking.  The haunting, stripped-down score complimented scenes while never overpowering them.  Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield, and Keira Knightley were brilliant in their respective roles as Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth.  Mulligan played the quiet, matter-of-fact Kathy with grace and sensitivity, while Garfield's performance as the unsettled yet innocent Tommy was powerful.  I was surprised by Keira Knightley's portrayal of Ruth.  I am not normally a fan of her work, but she presented such an darkly honest, heartfelt character that I almost forgot the actress completely.<br /><br />Despite giving it high marks for artistic value, I was surprised by how the filmmakers glossed over important characters and symbols.  It wasn't as if they didn't have the time; in a slow-moving, almost two-hour-long film, that was hardly an issue.  Yet the script seemed to focus more on the love triangle than anything else.  While Never Let Me Go is a love story, it is more importantly a story about being human and the desire to hold on to an \\"old kind world, one that... could not remain.\\"<br /><br />One the most key aspects of the novel's plot revolves around a Judy Bridgewater tape belonging to Kathy.  On it is the song \\"Never Let Me Go.\\"  In the story, Kathyimagines that the song is from the perspective of a mother singing to her baby, because of one of the lines: \\"Baby, baby, never let me go.\\"  In an early scene in the book, Kathy is caught holding a pillow in her arms and dancing to the song by Madame, who watches from the open doorway.  This memory resurfaces at the novel's end when Kathy talks to Madame for the last time.  In a final, poignant speech, the woman tells her, \\"When I watched you dancing that day, I saw something else.  I saw a new world coming rapidly.  More scientific, efficient, yes.  More cures for the old sicknesses.  Very good.  But a harsh, cruel world.  And I saw a little girl, her eyes tightly closed, holding to her breast the old kind world, one that she knew in her heart could not remain, and she was holding it and pleading, never to let her go.  That is what I saw.  It wasn't really you, what you were doing.  I know that.  But I saw you and it broke my heart.  And I've never forgotten.\\"<br /><br />I expected both these scenes to appear in the film.  After all, how could they not?  They are the very reason for the story's title.  Sadly, this was not the case.  The Judy Bridgewater tape did appear in the film as a gift from Tommy to Kathy and re-emerged several times during wistful moments when Kathy felt lonely.  However, it was not at all connected to Madame, and there was no powerful concluding speech at the film's end.  Instead of having Madame interrupt Kathy's dance at Hailsham, she was replaced with a cold, jealous Ruth standing in the doorway.  Simply using the tape as a way to enhance the tension between Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy would have been effective if it hadn't originally meant so much more.  This alone might be what disappointed me the most about the film.<br /><br />Without fleshing out characters like Madame and carefully depicting important story symbols, the film was reduced to a tragic love story in which life is stripped of value and its meaning bleakly questioned.  A novel as potentially powerful as Never Let Me Go deserves better.  By the time an hour and forty minutes rolled by, I was ready for the film to end.  Lovely scenery, top-quality acting, and a moving score couldn't cover up all that was missing from Ishiguro's beautiful story.  Instead of leaving me heartbroken and ponderous as the novel did, the film's ending just left me feeling empty.

B00915G6WQ|4.0|Watching all of season 7 of Dexter, and then trying to summarize my reaction, has left me feeling as confused and conflicted as any of the main series characters as  portrayed by Michael C. Hall and company.  On the positive side - and there are plenty of positives this season - the plot arc is chockablock with all sorts of entanglements in terms of romance and relationships ranging from excellent (Dexter and the female serial killer Hannah) to interesting (the continuing semi-incestuous fascination of Deb for Dexter as well as the romantic obsession of the gay Ukrainian mobster played by the always-excellent Ray Stevenson) to clunky and generally awful (Quinn's involvement with the Ukrainian stripper.)  In a voiceover that's insightful and almost sweet, if you're open to a \\"Serial Killers in Love\\" kind of vibe, Dexter analyzes his dark side and his past relationships with women in earlier seasons along the lines of `Lila was drawn to my darkness.  Rita was blind to it.  Lumen needed it.  But Hannah is able to see both sides of me and to like both sides.\\" Of course, ultimately, none of the relationships that are so central to Season 7 survive anywhere near to being intact.  In a whole variety of ways,  Dexter Season 7 mirrors  what the late movie critic Roger Ebert concluded about the Michelle Williams/Jason Segal film Take This Waltz: \\"The wounding power of love, its essential asymmetry and unfairness, permeates (this film).  The one thing you know for sure is that someone - maybe everyone - is going to get hurt.\\"<br />Coupled with all of the generally appealing exploration of interpersonal stuff there are some relatively interesting villains (which in and of itself puts this season far out in front of the disappointing season six) as well as some tricky plot twists which are generally successful in helping further the whole `will he or won't he finally be caught' thread that underlies the whole series.  A particularly clever ploy by Captain LaGuerta at the end ofthe penultimate episode worked well for me despite the fact that the whole premise was - on reflection - fairly implausible. (Spoiler alert: La Guerta - suspicious of Dexter - arranges for the aged mobster who had Dexter's mother killed to be released from prison in order to monitor his movements on the outside and try to trap Dexter in a murder attempt.)  Likewise, there is a totally ambiguous cliffhanger element in one episode - `would Deb go so far as to drug herself and crash her car to throw suspicion onto Dexter's girlfriend and get her out of the way so Deb can have Dexter all to herself'- that is a lot of fun  to contemplate until it gets resolved in the next episode.<br />All of those positive things aside, the season simultaneously manages to be hugely frustrating in the sense that the writers seem to have been so concerned with all of character analysis and exploration that they phoned in a lot of the writing in terms of the \\"Dexter and his dark passenger\\" narrative.  The net result was a plethora of WTF moments where logic and forensic reality (as well as what we know about the characters in the past) just seem to have been cast aside due to an excess of laziness.  (Second spoiler alert:  Toward the end of the series a key plot point involves a car crash in which Deb has been injured after presumably drinking water that has been spiked with Xanax.  The writers just glossed over the fact that Xanax in tablet form is virtually insoluble in water and that the tablets Deb had a prescription for as well as the less-likely Xanax drops BOTH would have had a disgustingly noticeable flavor - apparently niggling little details clearly deemed too inconsequential relative to the demands of the plot.  Likewise, Dexter makes a point of giving Deb a pen that has been tipped with the drug aconite supposedly as a way to establish the guilt of his serial killer paramour Hannah in the death of a true-crime writer, even though the viewer is totally aware that the tox screendone on the victim specifically focused on plant poisons such as aconite and none was found.  Duh.)<br />Bottom line: This season is far superior to season six and I'll certainly plan on sticking around for the next - and final - season that's upcoming.  My hope, however, is that having plumbed the depths of the main characters' emotions and motivations the writers will avoid going too much more overboard with that sort of thing (cf avoid the mistake that has made Bones such an unrewarding televisional experience lately) and will get back to focusing on the primary premise of Dexter and the thing that made it such a breath of fresh air when it first appeared.

B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|I didn't know anything about how Peter Jackson was going to tackle The Hobbit, but have read the book many times over the years and was looking forward to it.  That being said...I wasn't sure if this was The Hobbit or if I had forgotten what was in the book.  Yes, the essential plot was there, but there was so much added and I didn't realize ahead of time that he had decided to break it up into three movies and so felt like...hey, are they ever going to get to Smaug?<br /><br />Anyway, after I figured this out, I am of mixed feelings about the movie.  I could have done without the cutesy dwarf singing and slinging of dishes at the beginning of the movie, but I greatly enjoyed the albino warg addition and I even liked the sled pulled by rabbits (go figure!).<br /><br />I guess also do like the idea of having aspects of other works pulled into the Hobbit as this may be the only chance to see them on-screen, such as the Brown Wizard.  However, I also lean towards purism and wanting to see The Hobbit more as written.<br /><br />So...mixed feelings.  But I will keep the movie and go see the rest and withhold final judgment until they are all out.  Still looking forward to Smaug!

B00275EHJG|5.0|I've loved each and every Toy Story movie that's come out and the third one is equally wonderful.  Thes is my favorite animated movie series, with Shrek coming in a close second (mainly because Shrek 3 was terrible).  Each Toy Story movie has expanded the universe of toys and the issues that they have to deal with, issues that reflect our own lives.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 takes place at a turning point in the lives of Andy's remaining toys as he is pretty much grown up and off to college.  Will they end up going with him, be sent off to the attic, or thrown out?  In the end, his toys accidentally end up at a daycare run by another group of toys who are led by a sweet fuzzy bear named Lotso who smells of strawberries.  But things are not what they seem and Woody and Buzz and the rest of their friends need to figure out a way of the mess they've ended up in, pulling together once more to help each other.<br /><br />We meet even more toys in this movie, some familiar and some new.  Favorite scenes include the Dreamhouse one as Ken tries to impress Barbie with his clothes.  Mr Potatohead's troubles with a pigeon.  Plus, the final scene (which I won't give away) but is sweet and sad together and just perfect for the ending of the movie.<br /><br />One of the new characters, the cymbal-clanging monkey, is a bit freaky and might be uncomfortable for smaller kids.  Big Baby also has his freaky moments.  The dangers that the good guys get into can be a big too real for some younger watchers...but so were some scenes from the previous movies, including Toy Story 1 with the creepy toys in the bad kids room made out of parts of other toys and threatening to blow up Buzz.<br /><br />The animation just keeps on getting better in these movies and Toy Story 3 comes in second only to Toy Story 1 for innovation and creativity.  Highly recommended.  None of the movies have disappointed and Toy Story 3 is well worth owning.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan since the original series ever since my Dad introduced me to the Star Trek universe as a child. We then would watch the other series together when they were new... TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise + the movies. Thankfully years later we have continued the tradition and saw Into Darkness and all I can say is I felt like I was a little child again talking about it constantly after the movie. My Girlfriend also came along (not a fan) and now is interested in watching some of the other movies (Wrath of Khan) + the shows to get a better understanding of the Star Trek world. Thats how good this movie is!!!<br /><br />The visuals were mind blowing and was happy to see more visuals of the Enterprise in space and in difficult situations.<br /><br />But, thats all I will type since I do not want to ruin it for some of you who might have not seen it. But... if you have not seen it in the theaters yet, go see it now! Don't wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray/DVD or you will be dissapointed for not seeing it on the big screen.

Did not find his main character realistic or easy to like. Most interesting character was Lee Sawyer,FBI investigator. Not a bad read; but had to urge myself to pick it up each evening. Will continue to invest time and money on DB's books as this was one of his \\"older\\" books, and his newer ones have been much better, and more fun to read.

B002WY65UQ|4.0|The plot line is pretty standard--students overcome obstacles to save their school--but the Colin Firth gags make this one special.  Colin Firth falls in love with Rupert Everett playing &#34;Camilla,&#34; has a wet shirt scene, falls into a fountain, etc.  There are gags on many Colin Firth movies (Camilla, Valmont, Pride and Prejudice, Bridget Jones, etc.).  And although the outcome is predictable, it's fun to watch the actors get there.

0099581876|3.0|The Bat, written in 1997, is Jo Nesbo's first book in the Harry Hole series but it is first being published in the U.S. in July. I think this was a wise decision because I doubt that if The Bat was U.S. readers' (as well as UK and Canadadian readers' -- where it was also recently translated in English) first exposure to Nesbo's Harry Hole character that this series would have become as popular as it is now.<br /><br />I think the best way to view The Bat is as a vehicle to demostrate how far Jo Nesbo has come as a writer from his debut, as well as a device to learn more about Harry Hole's early days. Beyond that, there is not much I found interesting enough about The Bat to recommend it highly to you.<br /><br />I won't spend time describing The Bat's plot as this is well provided in the Amazon Book Description above. Rather, I will briefly describe three reasons why my opinion of The Bat is that it is just an okay read. One major reason is that it takes too long to get to any suspense and excitement, and when it does exist it is too little too late. Secondly, the plot tends to drag for long passages and several of the characters (other than Harry Hole and his Aborigine partner while in Australia, Andrew Kensington) were not particularly interesting and just servicable, at best. Thirdly, too much of the book reads like a travelogue, as Nesbo spends a lot of time describing the various sites and \\"sounds\\" of the various locations Hole and Kensington visit in the investigation to solve the murder of a young Norwegian woman in Australia. While this information is often intertesting it too often tends to slow down the pace of the book.

0345444051|5.0|This classic science fiction novel ranks as one of my favorites. It was published in 1953 and gives the reader a glimpse of a possible future in which Earth is ruled by an alien race. In this case, the feared aliens are peaceful and initiate global changes that benefit the human race tremendously.<br /><br />However, the Overlords in charge eventually bring about more sweeping changes that are at once disturbing and potentially transcendent to the native beings of the planet. I found this book to be awe-inspiring, giving me new perspectives on life and its meaning. Satisfying to both the spiritually minded and hardcore sci-fi fans, this book gets my strong recommendation.

B006ZT47O0|4.0|Dutch progressive/power/symphonic metallers Epica may have formed at the same time as a lot of Johnny-come-latelys (in 2003), but they possess two redeeming attributes that make them stand apart from the rest of the crowd in the already over-saturated genre. For starters, they have a frontwoman (Amanda Somerville guests on several of the tracks on their fifth album, 2012's \\"Requiem For The Indifferent\\") who has a very impressive set of pipes. And while Epica might not be the first group to do so (they follow in the same footsteps as Leaves' Eyes and Lacuna Coil), it is still a fairly unique and innovative quality to have in the genre. Secondly, the band boast some surprisingly brawny instrumental chops and technical prowess. They might not exactly be in the same boat as, say, Symphony X or Dragonforce, but they are still very accomplished musicians. Heck, one might even venture to say that Epica are more musically-impressive than the likes of Kamelot (a major influence on the band). They arm most of the songs on \\"Requiem\\" with crunchy, belligerent riffing, propulsive, technically-proficient leads, and tight, thrashy drumming. Even a few perfectly-placed solos pepper their arrangements, too.<br /><br />\\"Monopoly On Truth\\" follows-up the obligatory orchestral intro (\\"Karma\\"), by shifting into very Cradle Of Filth-sounding territory. It is a surprisingly up-tempo and confrontational track, and one that pins wailing female vocals against a wall of crunchy, aggressive, chugging riffs, dissonant death metal growls, and very muscular double-time drumming. A very decent guitar solo also pops up, here. The next several songs take on a different approach, though, and flesh-out the band's more melodic side. One of them (\\"Storm The Sorrow\\") dips into splendid melodic territory with a gorgeous piano break; another (\\"Anima\\") is another orchestral interlude; and another (\\"Internal Warfare,\\" which is dedicated to victims of mass murderer Anders Breivik) is mostly heavy, although it does adopt a sweeping guitar solo, and a nice, noteworthy keyboard/synth solo. And \\"Delirium\\" is a very soothing and pretty piece of piano-based balladry with stellar, dramatically soaring female vocals, and proggy, docile musical arrangements. And it all builds to a memorable climax, where guitarist Isaac Delahaye drops a little melodic solo. But with that said, it is the title tune that is the obvious highlight of the bunch, as it is an epic album centerpiece with Latin-flavored hand percussion, some harsh and visceral death metal growls that evoke Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt, industrial metal-esque, briskly crunchy riffing, and symphonic-sounding backing keyboard accents. Overall, the song comes across sounding like a latter-day Iron Maiden-esque ballad, albeit one that stretches across an uncomfortable eight-and-a-half minutes in length.<br /><br />Highlights of the album's second half are \\"Guilty Demeanor,\\" which comes across sounding like a symphonic metal band covering Black Sabbath (and one that boasts stellar, wailing female vocals); \\"Deep Water Horizon,\\" which begins as a progressive, pretty, acoustic-plucked ballad and morphs into a heavy, driving, Opeth-esque bruiser; and \\"Stay The Course,\\" a track that plays almost like full-on, Opeth-esque death metal, what with its punishing blast beats, thrashy, staccato riffing, and brutal, lower-register growls from vocalist Mark Jansen. But the undeniably biggest standout \\"Requiem\\"'s latter half has got to be the bonus track, \\"Twin Flames,\\" as it is a mostly instrumental, nearly ten-minute-long epic that is, again, very heavily influenced by the above-mentioned Cradle Of Filth and Opeth. It is filled with fiery, chugging riffs, and forceful, driving double-bass slamming.<br /><br />So pay attention to Epica and \\"Requiem For The Indifferent.\\" Fortune-tellers predict big things for the Netherlands-based seven-piece. \\"Requiem\\" is, after all, a good progressive/power/symphonic metal album from one of the genre's most promising and all-around upper-tier new groups.omising and all-around upper-tier new groups.
B00CMEQD30|4.0|I love a good fantasy story espeically in the lesbian genre and it doesn't get much better. This is my first time reading the author and I'd read her again. This has magic, curses, queens and knights....what more could you ask for.  Oh, wait, it also has 2 very good main characters that grow to love each other over the course of their adventure.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the book does get a bit preachy at the end and I would have enjoyed an additional love scene (or 2).  But this is still an execellent read for the price.

B006X3VNJK|5.0|Donald's first solo album does not disappoint in any way. With classics such as IGY and New Frontier you cannot go wrong. This pressing sounds fantastic, mastered by Chris Bellman it is as close to a direct transfer w/ minimal to no negative EQing. Some people complain that this pressing may be a little bright, but that is rubbish. No reason to spring for the MFSL, this is ALL that you need.

B00AQB2A3I|5.0|When Steven Wilson launched his \\"solo\\" career (not counting the very earliest Porcupine Tree albums which were really solo albums under the PT name) with \\"Insurgentes\\", it seemed that it was primarily a way for him to explore styles that would not fit into the PT mold/expectations; certainly the release of PT's \\"The Incident\\" did not seem to indicate that his main interests might move elsewhere. The second solo album, \\"Grace For Drowning\\", could also have been looked at the same way. But then Wilson started talking of PT as, while not dead, certainly being on an indefinite hiatus; and the effort that went into the GFD tour, culminating in the \\"Get All You Deserve\\" DVD, started to put his solo career in a different light. So when Wilson stated that he was now writing music with the GFD tour musicians, and their capabilities, in mind, and the possible PT resumption was pushed farther and farther into a hazy future, it seemed quite clear that his primary concentration was now in this new space; and \\"The Raven That Refused To Sing\\" presents musical evidence of this to where an official announcement seems unnecessary. This is the work of a musician who is inspired, focused, and reinvigorated - and confident in being so. A token of that confidence is the confidence he puts in the band - the songs were recorded live in the studio; and while some overdubbing took place, if you have been to any of the live performances on the \\"Raven\\" tour it is apparent that  those overdubs are grace notes - what you hear is organically the band.<br /><br />The tone for the new direction is set with \\"Luminol\\", which debuted on the later legs of the GFD tour, and was included on GAYD. The theme of reimagining the classic progressive rock of the 70's (about which more will be said at the end of this review) that was introduced on GFD with tracks such as the King Crimson-influenced \\"Raider II\\" is immediately made clear, with a bass and drum intro straight out of the classic Yes era; a brief vocal break brings to mind \\"Close To The Edge\\" or \\"Tempus Fugit\\". But that this is not simply a tribute is driven home in the playing of keyboardist Adam Holzman (for me the heart of this band), whose affected and non-affected electric piano takes the arrangement straight into fusion territory (Theo Travis' excellent wind instruments are also major contributors to this leaning throughout the album). While Guthrie Govan's guitar is more of a supporting instrument here, where he is featured he shows a confidence (there's that word again) and an aggressiveness that neither Aziz Ibrahim nor Niko Tsanev were willing or able to bring on the GFD tours. A very Crimsonish mellotron-led section (using the original Crimson mellotron, by the way) leads into a recapitulation of the first section of the song that brings the entirety to a powerful and satisfactory conclusion (it is in this last section that we hear how Govan's playing adds so much more than the previous guitarist who played the song).<br /><br />\\"Drive Home\\" follows; a ballad that would have sounded a bit different, but not out of place in the mid-period (\\"Stupid Dream\\"/\\"Lightbulb Sun\\") PT. Here Wilson shows how he can turn a musically-simple composition into an emotionally evocative and moving song. The use of an actual string section to augment the keyboards is handled with perfect balance and taste. Here is where Govan first steps out with a guitar solo that is beautifully melodic, with just enough of a sonic edge to set it both apart and consonant with the backing strings/keyboards.<br /><br />\\"The Holy Drinker\\" (which to me is the best track on the album) follows, with an intro that combines guitar, mini-moog, and sax in the best fusion manner. Wilson has said that he was thinking of the early Mahavishnu Orchestra when he wrote this section; and while I wouldn't say it sounds exactly like Mahavishnu, that band's position as one of the founders of fusion make the comparison apt. The vocal/\\"song\\" section that follows shows how Wilson has refined his \\"heavier\\" sound in a way that shows how he has taken his \\"metal\\" period  (which I loved - I still think \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\" is one of rock's all-time great albums) into something much more than pure guitar riffing.  The fusion sound returns, led again by Travis' sax and flute and Holzman's piano, culminating in a Hammond organ-like crescendo that invokes past prog but without going overboard. A spacy section that once again would not have sounded out-of-place conceptually in old PT unexpectedly transforms back into the metal-influenced sound, here sounding like, as the lyrics portray, something right out of hell itself, while eschewing noise-for-noise's-sake. A truly impressive track in all ways.<br /><br />Next comes \\"The Pin Drop\\". This was the track it took me the longest to get into; Wilson stretches his voice into a range that seems to teeter on the edge of cracking, but holds together. Acoustic guitar and piano break into a chorus of layered vocals driven by Marco Minneman's drumming, with Travis' sax again pushing the sound into something more than rock. The tension builds, only to be released with a deceptively simple vocal section - only to suddenly turn back into driving tension, with Govan's guitar now taking the lead, anchoring the sound back into the rock universe, with an ending that seems to leave the entirety suspended in mid-air; but in doing so avoids what would be a clichéd ending were it to come back down from the intensity.<br /><br />\\"The Watchmaker\\" shows its classic prog roots even more than \\"Luminol\\"; the combination of the acoustic guitars, flute, and vocals transports you back into classic-era Genesis, but with a lyrical restraint that Genesis ignored, often to its detriment. Yet even though it goes through several changes from section to section, it hangs together, making the transitions sound both fluid and natural. Again, a combination of Travis and Govan push an uptempo section forward, only to resolve back to a low-key yet complex vocal section somewhat reminiscent of \\"Every Home Is Wired\\" on PT's \\"Signify\\". The last section calls forth the demonic feeling of the ending of \\"The Holy Drinker\\" without sounding at all like a simple repeat of that song. Again, if you have seen the show, you know just how powerful it comes across live; yet that power shines through even on the album. This is another song that seems to grow with repeated listening.<br /><br />Finally comes the title track, \\"The Raven That Refused To Sing\\". The very simple piano underpinning immediately brings to mind \\"Get All You Deserve\\" from \\"Insurgentes\\"; but instead of resolving into a barrage of noise, it remains melodic and plaintive, musically and lyrically. This is another song that would not have sounded out of place in mid-period PT, and could be considered this album's answer to \\"Stop Swimming\\". As with \\"Drive Home\\" Wilson shows how much emotion can come out of the understated. While on most of the album the lyrics are a bit elliptical, to the point where you really need to read one of Wilson's interviews to get the full idea of the stories he is trying to tell, here the full impact of the tale comes through, while still avoiding unnecessary wordiness. For one last time Wilson shows how a song can build to a climax without bombast. It's a sad and sweet ending that leaves you with a haunting feeling that reflects the concept of the entire album.<br /><br />I mentioned early on the idea of the album as a reimagining of classic 70's prog, with nods to Wilson's own prior output. Some reviewers have said that he wears his influences too much on his sleeve, and have criticized the album as not really original. This is a legitimate question to raise. One could say that \\"The Pin Drop\\" is the closest thing to an original sound on the album, and the other songs could be looked at (maybe a bit cynically?) as \\"spot the riff\\". However, one could as easily say that every blues-based song is a rewriting of those that went before. I look at it it this way: if \\"Luminol\\" is Yes and \\"The Watchmaker\\" is Genesis, does it take those roots and utilize them in a way that expands and extends them in a new and modern way; and does it do it well? I would say to both questions the answer is an unqualified affirmative. Do we dismiss Tchaikovsky's symphonies because Beethoven wrote symphonies first? (Not that I'm comparing Yes and Wilson to Beethoven and Tchaikovsky in the absolute, but in a rock context one can use the analogy.) Wilson has taken classic prog and made it both relevant and exciting in a way no other current musician has. The musicianship and production are absolutely first-rate, and the songs are simultaneously challenging, catchy, and stand up on repeated (and repeated and repeated) listening. The album certainly earns its five-star rating.
B00AEBB8TM|5.0|This movie is now close to 15 years old, and I still laugh like hell every time I watch it.  The fact that idiot parents took their children to see this film at the movies when it came out (despite the glaring R rating) shows just how stupid adults can be, and is also one of the points Trey and Matt were making.

B00CC1JXYE|3.0|So basically this was a cheaper option than the official Samsung S View cover...and it came with more features...so I went for it as my first case on my brand new Galaxy S4. I still can't decide if I'm going to return it or not [UPDATE: I returned it, see below]...and here's why:<br /><br />PROS:<br />-It looks nice. The leather-like finish and styling of the case add more class to the device. It's drawn more than a few compliments thus far.<br />-S View works are promised, as well as I would expect from even a Samsung branded product. I really do like having the S View features...I will find it hard to switch to any other case that does not offer S View. I love being able to answer calls and see the time/notifications from the little window.<br />-It offers protection for the back of the phone that the Samsung version does not. While this does add a little more bulk, it's not a big deal to me and I'm quite OK with it.<br />-I love that the screen turns on and unlocks automatically when you open the cover...and then when you close it, it shows the S View time/notifications/battery/signal etc. for 5 seconds before the screen turns off. Not hitting the power button is something I appreciate often!<br />-The \\"kickstand\\" functions perfectly for me. I have never had it slip at all when using it. I use it every night as my bedside clock, propped up with the case stand, and it never falls. I watch videos in this positions etc. and even when I adjust the angle, which is a nice feature itself, it seems very stable. I think some other reviews who have problems are propping it up incorrectly? To be clear, the front of the case goes face down on the surface and you place the left side of the phone on top of it, at an angle of your choosing.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-FIRST AND FOREMOST - this is the DEALBREAKER (almost) for me. Sometimes when you have the flip cover open and folded back behind the device, [I believe] the magnet/sensor is still triggering the S View function. This happens VERY consistently when the phone is placed on a metal table or object with the cover folded back underneath it. The result is that you get stuck with the phone thinking the S View cover is over it and the screen is locked, showing you only the S View window...despite the fact that the actual S View cover is behind the phone, not on top of the screen! You then have to momentarily remove the flip cover from the back of the device to allow it to reset to normal...again: this happens sporadically in most cases but consistently when placed on a metal surface.<br />-SECOND AND NEARLY TIED FOR 1st - this is another DEALBREAKER (almost) that I am frustrated with: the case messes up the compass. I cannot get a proper reading with the compass even when performing the figure-8 manuever to re-calibrate it. Once I remove the case, it starts working again.<br />-The S View window is indeed a fingerprint and lint/dust magnet. You can clean it with varying degrees of success. I don't hate this, but it's a small annoyance.<br />-The flip cover itself does not lock in place when closed over the screen...it can move about 1 centimeter out of place up and to the left or down and to the left and about 1/2 centimeter directly left. Despite this, it does not trigger any issues like the screen turning on (thinking the case has been opened) and has had no real effect on my usage...it's just an obvious little quirk. Unlike the Samsung flip cover that I used on my S3, it has no issues with the cover not wanting to close all the way after being folded behind the device.<br />-As everyone has pointed out, when the flip cover is opened and folded behind the device, it partially blocks the camera, making it not an ideal way to take photos. Even if it didn't block the camera somehow, I wouldn't want to take pictures through the clear plastic S View portion of the cover...due to the previously mentioned fingerprints/dust/lint. When taking photos I just let the flap hang freely below the phone and it's not much of an issue aside from a small inconvenience.<br />-The \\"spine\\" of the case blocks access to the volume buttons...so you have to open the flap.<br />-A bit of a double-edged sword here: the power button. Upgrading from the S3 to the S4 I immediately felt that a power button I did not like before had gotten even worse (I feel it doesn't have enough tactile feel to it and is too hard to find/press and not clicky enough to let me know I really pressed it). The case has a cut out around the power button so you can access it...but it makes the button become recessed within the case, making it even harder to press than before. The other side here is that the S View flip cover itself makes pressing the button a less frequent need (see PROs above).<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If not for the magnet bugginess (CON # 1/2) this would be a solid 4 STAR review and I'd be quite certain to use this case for the entirety of my S4's life...I'm going to contact the manufacturer about that issue and see if it's a defect or a design flaw I'll have to deal with...I will UPDATE this review accordingly. Please post in the comments if you are also experiencing the inadvertent triggering of the S View display while the cover is folded behind the device and/or errors with your compass when the case is attached! Thanks.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />So far, excellent customer service from the seller, Rearth. I am replacing my current case with a new one to see if it's without the magnetic defects. I will update this review once I have tested.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: Rearth has been a good seller and helped me through this problem. They offered to send me a replacement case upon receiving my original, but I needed a case to protect my phone. I opted to purchase a 2nd case from them to compare and decide whether the original was defective or not. Unfortunately, the replacement case did not perform much better.<br /><br />It seems to me that part of the problem is that a brand new case still has some rigidity in the \\"spine\\" that keeps the phone slightly elevated from the magnet in the flip (when the flap is folded behind the phone and laying on a surface). After a few days or weeks of use, however, that rigidity is gone and the phone just lays flat against the flap. This exacerbates the magnetic issue...despite that, I was able to duplicate both defects on the brand new case.<br /><br />Anyways, I've posted two Youtube videos explaining the defects. Feel free to search for jeffr3ii and check out my \\"Jeff Howard\\" channel.<br /><br />I am returning both cases for refunds and looking for another product. I am sad to leave this one behind because I really do like it...the defects just ruin it for me, however.e and it's not much of an issue aside from a small inconvenience.<br />-The \\"spine\\" of the case blocks access to the volume buttons...so you have to open the flap.<br />-A bit of a double-edged sword here: the power button.

193700788X|2.0|I finished reading this book approx. 2 weeks ago and I'm still struggling to find the right words to express my feelings.<br /><br />First of all, DEA is better than the last two books which is the reason why it gets an extra star in addition to the original 1-star.<br /><br />I initially received DUD, the first book without knowing it was a series or a show. I fell in love with the art on the cover, Bon Temps, Sookie, Bill of course, the plot etc. Little did I know I was going on a never ending odyssey. After almost all possible magical creatures known to mankind have been introduced to the storyline - including the devil in this last book! - we get this!?!?! I can clearly say that I fully regret ever being led to read DUD. I should have stopped reading after Dead Until Dark because it was initially planned to be a stand alone.<br /><br />DEA starts with a third person narrative, something CH has never done in all these years of her writing the SVM which alienates the reader from a world you already think you know. We get lots of old characters tap dancing through the stage for their 1 minute of show time and then *poof* they are gone. Everything felt rushed and the plots made no sense at all. I won't complain about continuity issues because this is something you have to get used to when reading a Charlaine Harris, the plots are what make me dislike this book so much. I struggled to finish this book and after finishing it I felt incredibly tired and numb. I kept flipping back to front to see if I had missed any vital information. For years now readers have been complaining about the \\"felt\\" watered down storyline. The last three books could have easily been written as one book because while the last two books were the epitome of a bore festival this last one was full of dull plots and lame motives from the antagonists. I won't spoil it for anyone but be prepared to be shocked by the lack of creative ideas when reading DEA. I hardly believe Sookie doesn't have anymore enemies now that the devil has been introduced, Felipe is back in town, the FOTS members still exist and Karin is only protecting her for a year and so on.<br /><br />I also don't understand what the sense is of a southern vampire mystery with vampires' being doomed at the end all because Sookie loves to tan. Sookie surprisingly developes a mindset that resembles that of the FOTS members and it baffles me that the editors approved this garbage. On one hand I'm happy Alan Ball weighed in against the author killing Bill as he is my favourite vampire but on the other hand I hate the fact that the author listens to people telling her how to write her own stories.<br /><br />The vampires drew me to these series and not Sookie's cooking recipes or gardening skills. She started out as a spunky barmaid and after all that has happened she ends up being a hypocritical and spineless barmaid without personal growth.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I loved this series from the beginning.  Fun and a treasured ' guilty pleasure..'  Now when I purchase the the latest installment, I want my money back.  The plot is a collection of old tales from prior books.  Nothing new.  The characters are predictable and as bored as I am reading it.  It's past time to end it all.

B005J4TLQG|5.0|This film is great. It has a tight, focused story, with great creature design. Not to mention the incredible soundtrack as well. It really reminded me of old John Carpenter films, which is a great thing. This is Joe Cornish's first film and he knocked it out of the park. The film really has a confidence to it that seems like it came from a veteran director. And the special features are great as well, the best for me being the commentary tracks.

He is just like ny other kid, dreaming he is famous and getting bullied.its sensational!

193700788X|4.0|Wow!! All the negative reviews! I will not bore the readers with a synopsis of the book that has been done countless times here on Amazon. Charlaine Harris has found a way for the Sookie Stackhouse character to live a healthy, happy life and maybe get her HEA. I am suprised that the readers that have panned the book did not see the direction being taken in the last two Sookie books. Come now folks - did you really think that Sookie would survive and be productive based upon the events that have taken place in her life in the last couple years? The author tucked it up nicely and gave the readers hope that Sookie was loved and respected. All the good guys and the bad guys got exactly what was coming to them. Karma.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Best kids book ever. My kids laugh and giggle as the turn pages despite Grover grovepleas. My adult son still enjoy y s this book and remembers remembers reading it as a chi l d.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I would recommend this to others.  It helps some, but not as much as I expected.  Now I need to try different types of earphones.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A soulful reminder of the men who fight for the freedoms we take for granted.  A book I will read again.
B004BSFSTA|2.0|My sister got me these for Christmas and after almost a year of light use the joint where the headphone connects to the band completely fell apart. Until that point I was decently satisfied with the sound. Not amazing but about what I expected at the price point. The build quality is awful though. I only used them a few times a week and for them to fail so catastrophically with no warning is unacceptable. I've seen that other reviewers have had the same problem.
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo & Stitch is a very cute, classic movie that I am happy to have included in my movie collection. It has a great message about  'Ohana meaning family, and no one being left behind. It's about finding yourself and discovering (or rediscovering!) the importance of family. It will touch your heart, make you cry, make you laugh, and will be one you'll watch again & again. :) Definitely a great movie!
1609611543|4.0|I am glad I read this but there is a lot of info on genetic diseases and blood sugar levels that is inserted. My heart goes out to those who suffer from this but I am interested in getting off wheat. I've been off for 8 weeks and feel great, so it is worth reading.
B008MM9630|5.0|I am enjoying this game.  I have seen 1 bug with the &quot;move your house&quot; quest.  I have moved it back and forth a few times but the program doesn't seem to detect the task as complete.  Also there are a few quests that seem to appear way too soon before I have knowledge or see the items available.  For example, i do not see a gold rose or the animals in the quests.  But despite those things I am enjoying the game and will continue to play, give it a chance.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is simple and only works on the Kindle Fire. But the layout is really good and it is very easy to use.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I just downloaded it but so far loving it. Very little ads and it doesn't glitch. Two thumbs up. Very addictive.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is completely from the males point of view. Which was new and different to me. And very very funny. I was laughing out loud and some of the stuff he is thinking and saying. Great read.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|I'm so happy that Barbra's movies are finally coming out on Blu-Ray.  No one deserves it more than her.  I love her music and movies.  She's the best.
B005HF0B34|5.0|I love the interpertation of how a spoiled king will do anything to get his way.  The cast do a wonderful job on encompassing their roles and enveloping the era of King Henery.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows on tv...couldnt stop watching it..helped me through long workouts.  Cant wait for season three to start.

1407115561|4.0|A really nice story. My son (3) loves it and has identified a family member with each dragon (i'm the strippy one - why I do not know, I'm just glad I'm not the pink one with chicken feet!).
B002RI9HUM|4.0|For my first MK book, I was pleasantly surprised, some parts were slow but by the end was extremely enjoyable. Look forward to reading another!
B00AMUOP22|4.0|I love this song!  It's just too bad it doesn't have remixes.  It's very difficult to find maxi singles in this digital age.  I'm still a firm believer in purchasing cds still.  There's nothing like having your own, &#34;physical,&#34; library at home and compiling your own files or cds for your listening pleasure!
B00881VLCE|2.0|I played a few times and then it froze up and I had to delete it.  At least I didn't pay anything for it.
B0015FWRHS|4.0|I find it rather good, especially the original compositions of the artists are very creative.<br />I will look for other works of A.Cohen.
1885167776|5.0|This is the greatest book. Brings back to basics. making you think twice even three times about the decisions we make in life. Getting back to simplicity. Doing the one thing that propels the others things in life to fall into place. We make life so complicated now a days that this is a refreshing book about getting back to basics with sincere thought on how to move forward. Putting structure back into things we do everyday and just take for granted. Love this book. Great easy read.
B00CATSONE|1.0|I did not have high expectations, given the price paid for this 'book'. Even so, I felt disappointed. Calling it a book is rather ambitious - 'fanboy essay' would be closer to the mark.<br /><br />Nikola Tesla was undoubtedly an interesting character and I feel the story of his life  deserves better than this poorly constructed, repetitive and mind numbingly dull piece of work offers.<br /><br />Quotations are liberally (over)used with no context or justification as to how they apply or addition of original thought from the author - just simple parroting of others statements.<br /><br />Tesla's flaws and failures barely rate a mention, rather he is lauded as having 'invented the twentieth century', which is patently false. The  twentieth century was always going to follow the nineteenth century regardless.<br /><br />Incidentally, the  book was free and still seemed overpriced to me as I had to invest time reading it. I only post this review because the author specifically asked me to.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Drew Evans is a great character and written very realistically.<br /><br />These guys exist.<br /><br />He is what we call a \\"hitter\\". And beings the story takes place in NYC, it is a very fitting local expression and explains him perfectly.<br /><br />Every woman has a \\"Drew Evans\\" story. Whether directly or indirectly. He's that guy that is smart, successful, amazingly handsome and knows it, spoiled, get's what he wants at any cost, knows what he wants, charming, boyish, immature, irritatingly confidant, loves his family, good friends, just overall looks really great on paper. If you meet him, and are smart, you run the opposite way. Most women don't. Most women are very taken by these guys. Sadly. This is the guy that only wants you for the moment. Tells you this, but you still fall for him.<br /><br />Kate is a smart girl. She went to Wharton for goodness sakes. You don't go to Wharton because you want too, Wharton has to want you. She is smart, confidant, beautiful, knows what she wants, a real go-getter. She has worked very hard for her success and deserves it. She is also fiercely loyal and engaged to her childhood boyfriend. Her only only boyfriend, naturally, she's a good girl. He's a guy who doesn't deserve or appreciates someone like Kate.<br /><br />Drew and Kate's initial meeting is in a bar, of course. She passes him up. Something he is not used too and that makes him very intrigued with her. Momentarily of course. You see, Kate knows who Drew is. She is an I-banker, as is Drew, and just accepted a position at his father's company. Drew is stunned when he sees she is the new hire he was told about and even more surprised when his father wants him to mentor her.<br /><br />This is where the hijinks begin. Drew is crass with Kate, let's her know he wants her. A human resources nightmare. But Kate holds her own with him. The drive to \\"have\\" her switches to the drive to \\"crush\\" her when he discovers he has to work with her on a new account. Now this is very unsettling to Drew, after all he does not share his toys.<br /><br />Their desire to win is hysterical. They both completely go out of their way to trip each other up. Pure comedy and very realistic You can visualize their antics. All the while the smoldering attraction is still going on and a back drop to all their actions.<br /><br />They eventually do get together which naturally only leads to hurt and heartbreak. But it also changes Drew. Well, actually it opens his eyes up to the fact that he just might really like Kate. There were signs but signs he brushed off with his usual explanations.<br /><br />The story is told from the male POV, Drew's. Something that is a first for me. It is also told in a narrative style. Drew is telling you his story. Telling you as though you are sitting on the couch with him. I totally loved that. Again a first for me. I know of no other story told in a narrative of the male POV. Hooked me from the opening chapter.<br /><br />Emma Chase did an amazing job telling you this story. I was completely engaged by the characters. The supporting characters including Drew's friends and family, especially his niece Mackenzie were just as engaging, entertaining, and rounded out the story line.<br /><br />A definite must read for all the romantic comedy readers and a great start for Emma Chase. An author I will be keeping my eye on! o_Oy unsettling to Drew, after all he does not share his toys.<br /><br />Their desire to win is hysterical.

B002VPPS18|5.0|Honestly, I was expecting a much larger book.  Exactly like the one in thee opening of the movie.  It's still cute!  Lol!  It's also a timeless classic!  I love the story of Sleeping Beauty!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I spent 100 dollars on these headphones and cannot believe they were that cheap. They have great sound quality, surround sound,  programmable buttons, a good microphone AND are wireless. Honestly I am waiting for them to break because I can't figure out how Logitech can sell them so cheap. So far they seem durable and great. Worth every penny.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Emotional and very deep. Excellent book. Like a lifetime movie but only better. Saw most of it coming but it still touched my heart. A
B00CATSONE|4.0|What I read was intellectually stimulating. But I find contentment more appealing than competition. I don't want to die a broken person like Tesla did. As a Christian I will die triumphantly.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good game. However, be warned it is addictive. The early levels are not a challenge but get into the 11x11 and they get harder
B0091REZMW|1.0|Free is a misnomer.  The game wants you to \\"share\\" it with your friends on Facebook, invite friends to buy you in game items, and purchase objects to keep playing.  Plus, it's boring.  I've played other hidden objects games before.  They were more interesting and they didn't require in game purchases or friends to play.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|The graphics card functions as described. I had read good reviews of asus cards and this one is great. It is rather large so make sure you have some space in your system. I had to spend a while setting up other wires to go around it properly. This isn't an issue with this card anymore than it is with other GTX660s. I can play most games with best graphics and no issues with frames. Would recommend.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best I've ever read.  I'm now on the this particular book and it hasn't lost any of its edge so far.  I'm sorry that Stieg Larsson didn't live to complete more books.  I love his style of writing and the attention to detail that he painstakingly took. I'd recommend these books to anyone who loves action, adventure, suspense and a bit of romance.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Cute movie...watched it with my 3 and 4 year old. They loved it too. I would recommend this movie to other families with young kids.

B00CE004XM|5.0|Beth and Joe are simply magic. Covers are generally pretty hit and miss for me. It's hard to respect the original yet make the cover different and interesting enough to warrant a cover in the first place. But Joe and Beth somehow managed to make some of these classics sound even more alive and rocking than, dare I say it, the originals.<br /><br />Now the music is where we get into muddy water though. Personally, I'm astounded that Beth and Joe were able to make some songs sound like they could both be simultaneously be playing on the radio now, as well as could have been played on the radio in the 70s and 80s. It's a real testament to their musical sensibilities as well as clearly shows the influence of producer Kevin Shirley (Led Zeppelin, Journey, Iron Maiden). It's big band, r&b, rock, blues, and soul. And therein will lie the problem for many people. Despite Joe and Beth both being incredible blues artists--this is not a blues album. If you were expecting a pure blues sound in every song--then walk away. However, if you can check expectations at the door, then prepare to be blown away.<br /><br />\\"Nutbush City Limits\\" is the first big standout for me. Beth certainly does Tina proud. It's aggressive and seething with intensity.  Buddy Miles' \\"Miss Lady\\" is another showstopper. Beth's vocals are honestly mind-blowing. She can go from the smooth jazzy groove to hit a perfect Janis Joplin wail. What's more striking than her sheer vocal skills though, is her ability to connect to the material. When her voice breaks, she can make your heart break. Comparisons to Etta James or Billie Holiday are completely justified. And her Nina Simone inspired take on the classic \\"Strange Fruit\\" is spell binding.<br /><br />Now, Joe does have his moments as well; his guitar work on \\"Can't Let Go\\" made holding my body still while listening physically impossible. However, every song does not \\"feature\\" Joe. At times, especially in the songs with big horn sections, he's essentially background. I think it's important to recognize though, that even when Joe's guitar isn't out front--he--and not Beth, is the driving force behind the direction of the music. While Beth is a great songwriter in her own right, it's clear Joe is in the driver's seat musically for this album. While talking about the music again, it's important to mention that the backing band are quite simply in a league of their own.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that this album \\"got him and his wife in the mood.\\" While I don't want to make things awkward, he's not far off the mark. This album simply electrifies your body. It's smoky and passionate yet aggressive with a killer groove. If you're prepared to appreciate it for what it is, this album is quite simply one of the best of the year. Highly recommend to literally everyone.ground.

B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|A lot of Demi Lovato's songs have been hit or miss for me in the past, but after listening to the album samplers, and her releasing her tracks early this time around, I thought I'd go ahead and buy Demi. To my surprise, I love it. There's really only one song on the album that I skip, &#34;Never Been Hurt,&#34; and that's only because it's incredibly repetitive if you've already listened to &#34;Unbroken.&#34; Standouts are definitely &#34;Warrior&#34; and &#34;Two Pieces.&#34; (Also, a plus - it was less expensive to get the digital version here than it was on iTunes, and it's still iPod compatible.)
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Great app dose what it says it will do. It start storming while I was at work and the power went out. So I found this app and everyone was saying how bright it was.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|This DVD will not play in my DVD player; therefore, I cannot watch it on the TV with my family. Additionally, the DVD has been setup in a way that does not allow one to access the menu when viewing it on a laptop...very disappointing purchase! Great film, but this DVD is not consumer friendly!
B001DWNUCO|1.0|The service provided by the seller was excellent.  The film in and of itself is one of the worst films I've ever seen.  I was curious and thought it would be a polished production.  It wasn't.  Poorly edited, acted, filmed.  A dissapointment.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is fun relaxing and very additive. good for the kids from 5 to 99. I love to play for hours. most games I turn off the music but this one I keep on.
B003VANOFY|3.0|These headphones are fantastic when it comes to quality of sound and mic, but the headphones have the issue of disconnecting every so often for roughly 10sec.<br />I had to return and replace a pair of these headphones because, it couldn't connect again to the wireless adapter.<br />Also they can be uncomfortable after a couple of hours.<br />Even with these issues these are still probably the best gaming headphones you can get for roughly $100.
B008220C38|3.0|The character acting as Anna Karenina's lover was not portrayed  as a very manly, or strong you would fall for.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Delightful set. Columbo is a cult figure. The late great Peter Falk is sorely missed.  Very good value for the price.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Overall I enjoyed reading the book. It gave me more awareness on mental health. Very daring, sad, funny, and insightful characters. I can relate to some issues and how Pat is so hopeful and so wants a happy ending for himself. Silver linings is a must read!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Lake's brother Kel seemed more like a 6 year old than a 9 year old.  I have an 8 year old and a10 year old and Kel just seemed really immature.  Same thing with Caulder.  They didn seem more their age until the 2nd book.<br />Other than that small distraction, the book was good.  I stayed up late reading it because I didn't want to put it down.  I love when books make you have strong emotions... I cried in parts and laughed out loud at parts (rotting kidney beans...LoL).  The connection between Will and Lake is so strong, but still believe able.  There's just enough 'cheese' without being too much.  And just when you think you know, a bombshell gets dropped.  I can't wait to read This Girl to get Will's point of view.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My husband teaches fifth grade and gave me the task of scoping out new books for his students to read. Over the past few weeks, I've read dozens of poorly written books for kids in the middle grades. Then I found Wonder. I honestly didn't believe that it could live up to all of the hype, but it exceeded my high expectations. The characters were genuine, relatable, and likable, and there's a lot of meat to the story and the human beings that the author has created.<br /><br />I can't recommend this highly enough.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Strong set of songs. This is a proper album played by a collective of amazing players. Dave knows what rock has to sound like!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I first played it alone then I played it online PS3.  I love the fact that you can play this game with someone else so those things you may have missed the first time around you can have a partner to help you along the way. The ending of this game I was in complete AWE....  Beautiful music as well.
0618918248|2.0|Review of Dawkins' \\"The god delusion\\" by Paul F. Ross<br /><br /> Richard Dawkins, British biologist, makes a pitch for atheism in The god delusion.  A specialist in evolution, Dawkins understands how evolution builds complex structures out of simple structures.  He therefore sees no need for the \\"God hypothesis,\\" no need for a postulate about \\"intelligent design.\\"  He urges that atheists exist in large numbers, even in very religious America, and argues that atheists need to declare themselves with pride.  Dawkins advances his arguments by outlining his book (Chapter 1), pointing to the weakness in agnosticism (Chapter 2) and weakness in the arguments for God's existence<br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Dawkins, Richard  The god delusion  2008, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston MA, 464 pages<br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />(Chapter 3), sees no need for a designer (Chapter 4) since evolution takes simple ingredients and builds them into complex structures, probes for insight into why so many cultures have espoused a god or gods (Chapter 5), looks for the roots of morality to see if religion is their necessary birth environment (Chapters 6 and 7), points to why religion has not been a good thing for the world (Chapter 8), reviews the propriety of indoctrinating children in religion (Chapter 9), and explores the justification for religion as consolation and as inspiration (Chapter 10).<br /><br /> This reader is a scientist, joins Dawkins in many of Dawkins' criticisms of religion, sees the issues (Is there a god? What is god's role in the universe and in human affairs? Is religion necessary?) as worth carefully organized thought, finds many of Dawkins' arguments worthwhile ... but also finds Dawkins a tiresome pursuer of tangents (a flaw about which the author is aware ... \\"I must beware of riding off on my pet steed Tangent\\" p 198 ... but seems unable to avoid) and sophomoric in choosing narrow arguments when broader, more mature viewpoints would persuade more atheists to \\"come out.\\"  Dawkins uses many pages when fewer would do very well.<br /><br /> Dawkins, born to Anglican parents and understandably drawing most of his examples from Christian sources, correctly points to stories in the Jewish and Christian Old Testament and the Christian New Testament displaying behaviors, behaviors approved in those texts, that evoke revulsion among many people today.  Since many see the Bible as written by God, Dawkins points to those terrible behaviors as flaws in Christianity.  He's correct in labeling the behaviors as flaws by today's moral standards.  He notes that Christians pick and choose which stories from the Bible to emphasize, saying that is a flaw.  True, today's Christians do pick and choose Biblical stories on which to focus.  Dawkins points to the dim historic roots of the texts comprising the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible, notes that many transcribers and translators have added \\"corrections\\" and probably also errors to those texts.  That's correct.  Dawkins sees the Bible as a document created by human authors and editors, not as a text written by God, and this reader agrees with Dawkins.  Still, Dawkins' attacks are sophomoric.<br /><br />Having recently attended a performance of Brahms' Requiem, this reader was aided by the projection on screen of the Biblical sources of each of the elements of text in the Requiem as those elements were being sung.  The fragments came from all parts of the Old and New Testament, from documents created by humans in a span of over three thousand years (from as early as 2000 BCE to 1600 CE).  These texts were selected (editorially) by Brahms based on his own life's experience.  The premier of his Requiem was in 1868, not long after Darwin published On the origin of species (1859).  Brahms did not select from the despicable stories of the Bible as evaluated by today's moral sensitivities.  Instead he selected the phrases that deal with issues that were real in Brahms' time and are real today (e.g. one's own mortality).  Brahms finds phrases that offer the optimism needed to make the next step in the listener's daily life.  Brahms presents a reason - not a logical thought, but an emotional force - to step forward in hope.  Brahms' editorship and musicality continue to deliver a message providing uplift acceptable today, a century and a half later, choosing his Biblical sources from the potpourri of ideas and texts found in the Bible, some of which are over three thousand years old.  Dawkins argues that morality as realized today comes from today's zeitgeist - he's afraid to use concepts from the behavioral and management sciences that describe the transfer of ideas from one generation to the next in what can be called acculturation.  Dawkins argues that morality is not drawn from the holy books of today's major religions (since those religions report role models for behavior that are repugnant under today's widely accepted moral guidelines).  Is there not hope, even evidence, that human cultures evolve (e.g. food provisioning evolved from hunting-gathering to agriculture, transport evolved from walking to horseback riding to using wheeled vehicles to flying to space travel)?  Humans embrace ideas today that were ideas held by few people as little as two hundred years ago.  Consider, for example, the notion that government needs to rest upon a process in which every law-abiding adult has a voice.  While that notion has large support today, it certainly is not held by all people worldwide.  It found support (at least for men as voters) in the thirteen colonies in 1775 CE.  Women were given the vote in the U.S. in 1920 CE.  Cultures evolve.  What we have today does not emerge from an amorphous worldwide zeitgeist ala Dawkins (as Dawkins himself realizes, leaving to psychology and sociology the task of explaining how the zeitgeist is created).  This reader doubts that cultural changes are prompted by an evolutionary change in the human brain structure.  This reader understands and accepts changes in thought and behavior that are learned, cultural evolution ... does not think that older generations always pass to younger generations, or Culture A always passes to Culture B, commendable and useful information, but does acknowledge and respect acculturation as an evolving process (we recently added the internet as an influence in the evolution of worldwide culture) transferring evolving ideas.  This reader thinks Dawkins needs to move past his childish delight in issuing criticisms about ideas that many cultures held at the time of earliest recorded history and have long since abandoned although they have not excised those ideas from the historic literature that has survived over those three thousand years.<br /><br /> This reader joins Dawkins in accepting as a trustworthy source of truths evidence gathered by the sciences, a way of thinking invented by humans.  In a recent book Berkowitz (2012) describes how the \\"stardust revolution\\" has introduced the notion that a kind of evolution does indeed provide a believable and elegantly simple explanation about how complex inorganic substances developed from the likely simple substances composing our universe shortly after the Big Bang (e.g. hydrogen atoms) to the complex \\"inorganic\\" molecules and even the \\"living\\" molecules we have today, presenting chemical and biological evolution as (possibly) one continuous process through time.  The science on which the book is based leaps the gap between no life and life with \\"evolutionary\\" simplicity.  I urge that the behavioral and management sciences also describe how ideas evolve in human cultures.  I concur with Dawkins in thinking that poetic insights, as expressed in Brahms' Requiem, do not yield truth in the sense that science yields truth.  But poetic (artistic) insights can and do provide inspiration.  This reader thinks Dawkins needs to recognize the truth of cultural evolution - a truth as verifiable by independent human observers as the truth that early simple life on earth evolved into the homo sapiens we know today - and modify his arguments in a way that understands and respects that truth.  Not incidentally, scientists need to understand and acknowledge that their conviction about an acceptable source for truth is as much conviction-based as the theist's faith.<br /><br />In The god delusion, Dawkins reports exchanges he has had with audiences in his public lectures defending atheism.  This means he is adopting issues as well as styles of interaction handed to him by his audiences.  His may be a thoughtful way to interact with one's audience ... responding to their issues, using a style of debate they understand.  By this choice for his written expression, however, Dawkins models, preserves, and promotes the infantilism in thinking about religion that he meets in public discussion and correctly condemns.  Is that the best way to accomplish the author's objectives?  I think not.<br /><br />Bellevue, Washington<br />20 May 2013<br /><br />Copyright © 2013 by Paul F. Ross.

B00CW665VI|4.0|Wallbanger was fresh and surprising while managing to choreograph a well-rounded cast of complicated characters and a rich skein of sweetness and romance. And it had a singular comedic voice. Tangled is much better than Beautiful Bastard and is a fast, fun-filled and entertaining read that is well worth buying. It is well-written and well-executed and in the world of contemporary romance, that is a small miracle. Read it, for sure. But does it belong in the exalted company of Wallbanger. That just sets the reader up for disappointment.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Adventure and insight into each character quickly draw the reader into the story.  Enjoyed every word and would read again.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle is one of my favorite tv shows.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching it uninterrupted by commercials.  The seller sent it out in great condition and very quickly.
1401322786|5.0|I chose this rating because the book was in good condition. It also arrived on time, and I didn't have to wait forever to get it. I would recommend this book company to my friends.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I use this as a one click apps so that I will not be going to internet explorer at all times
1608199096|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic, I can't believe it took me so long to get it in my kitchen!<br /><br />The recipes range from simple and easy (basic crostini, cocktails salads) to the absurd and difficult (braised ox tongue, cuttlefish braised in its own ink) - however, I found myself dying to try all of the more ridiculous dishes, as they all looked so scrumptious. The photography in the book is perfect, as it doesn't show 'over-plated' and unattainable dishes, it demonstrates how nicely these recipes look on their own merits.<br /><br />The measurements in the book are in metric, however, so whip out your kitchen scale. Personally, I've had a blast measuring all of my pork and veggies in grams instead of cups. It definitely makes for more accurate cooking, which I'm starting to carry over into other aspects of my kitchen. And don't forget to convert your oven temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit!<br /><br />LOVE this cookbook, worth the money and the hassle of finding some odd ingredient!
B00003CXFV|5.0|Awesomely &#34;true&#34; movie was superb, and the price for the movie through Amazon very competitive as usual. Nice to add this one to my collection.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I've been waiting for a new DP album for nearly 5 years (not counting TRON). I NEVER would have guessed that the duo would ever put out material like this. This is beautiful. It flows so perfectly for me. I especially like \\"Touch\\",\\"Give Life Back to Music\\" and \\"Contact\\", because of the structure of each song.<br />10/10
0307341577|4.0|I finished Gone Girl and couldn't wait to jump into another book by Flynn. Dark Places is good, but definitely twisted! I liked Gone Girl better, but that was hard to beat for me! You will enjoy Dark Places if you enjoyed Gone Girl. It's a little dark (pun intended) but it keeps you captivated!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I am in love with this game. I played it when it was only on Apple products and loved it then, I just didn't own anything Apple. Now that it's available on Android, I am the happiest girl in the world. I immediately got it on my kindle Fire and played through every level that day. What's cool is you can go back and play the levels again and try them a different way than the first time you played it. It's very much like an endless game of creativity! Well done to Warner Bros for making a great game that entertains me for hours. Not only is it a good game for me but kids love it too. It helps them use their imagination and actually see it happening! No stifling the imagination here.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The only flaw in this game is the amount of work required before you can build a new suit.<br />I definitely enjoy playing this game.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game is cute and fun...if only my hands weren't tied until I PAY for the things needed in order to progress!!!
0451209338|5.0|Our library mystery group read this mystery and enjoyed it.  The plot is involving and unfolds in different countries.  We liked the art restorer-agent Gabriel Allon, although he isn't the warm personal type.  He's rather aloof and enigmatic.  I really enjoyed his boss, Ari Shamron, the master spy who is a great foil to Allon's style.<br /><br />The plot of trying to trap a Palestinian assassin who is plotting to kill the Israeli Prime Minister is compelling. Enjoyed the action scenes in Manhattan and the cameo of Arafat.  What fun!<br /><br />The action is fast-paced, the writing and plotting is taut and it's an interesting international series.  I wonder if it would ever evolve into film as it has a cinematic feel.  After reading this book, I quickly picked up other books in the series, which I enjoyed equally.<br /><br />If you like a kind of international spy story, this offers it up.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|ThePianoGuys are amazing, and this CD is completely fantastic, bringing in some of their best songs. I was going to list my favorite couple songs, but I honestly can't decide--each piece is a masterpiece, and I eagerly await what TPG has planned for the future. If you don't follow them on YouTube, definitely do so. And if you haven't bought this CD yet, you really must--you won't be disappointed.
0440237688|5.0|This is the best book EVER and the other books (gathering blue, messanger, and son) are also really good if you read and like the giver you have to read these books to :)
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|You may have to be a software engineer and have grown up in the 70's 80's to really get the humor, but this was a funny movie, highly recommend!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I've seen the HBO program, and wanted to read the books. I was not disappointed. The book seemed less crude to me than the show, although I like the show, this might be of interest to those who have heard the books are obscenely vulgar and so shy away from them. I find the characters more complicated and the storyline a bit richer when you READ it... that's pretty normal, I guess. I Plan on reading the rest of the series. In short, this book has an interesting way of narrating, and very likeable characters. The plot keeps you guessing, and I like that.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have never read a book like this. Colleen Hoover is an artistic genius! I spent a whole day just reading this book it was that hard to put down. The story is breathtakingly beautiful and heart wrenching. The depth of the characters was amazing. Just when I thought I had the secret figured out another twist would surprise me. Dean and sky are so sweet together and strong for each other. This story blew me away. You have to read this book!
0060763280|5.0|Will this book make you a millionaire overnight? Eh... Probably not. I went from living in a garage to a highrise since I've read it, but I'd say college had a lot to do with that too.<br /><br />What makes the book great is that it shows you how to identify poor patterns within yourself. There's a lot of very solid techniques to build good behavior, but what is more impressive is how much bad behavior it's cut out of my life.<br /><br />Well that's my take anyways. Here's one thing to look at. Harv made himself a multi-milionaire from nothing BEFORE he started doing any consulting or teaching. Definitely some credibility in that.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought this cord thinking there was an issue with my previous cord. That was not the case I'm having issuers with my Kindle. The cord works great. Nice and long. I recommend this product to e everyone.

0345803485|1.0|Noun: porn (porn)<br />Usage: vulgar<br />1. Creative activity (writing or pictures or films etc.) of no literary or artistic value other than to stimulate sexual desire<br /><br />From dictionary and it fit perfectly. I am not sure why she is mainstream author and what is all hype about? Most reviews here are lengthy and with complex analysis of the book because the readers of \\"BOOK\\" expect it to be somewhat literary and artistic. And when that expectation is not met we write long reviews. Which is expected for any other book but this book should not be even considered as book. Its porn. I am surprised that the author is praised everywhere and most surprised to see these books on our public library shelf. WOW.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|The story touched my heart. Mr Stein is obviously a dog lover. And dogs very obviously ( to me anyway) have a much richer emotional life than they are believed to. Loved the ending!
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|I was strongly eager to buy this dvd and I mean I don't regret buying it, it's just not everything I dreamed of.<br />First off, the cast seemed very distant. I know it is meant to be in the Dark Ages but the love between Guinevere and Arthur wasn't as magical as I had hoped. They seemed as though they did not like being near each other (of course I mean after they cured Guinevere of course). Even Merlin and Arthur seemed a little distant also. I realize Merlin wants to finally say who he really is but he seemed like he totally hated Arthur. As if he wanted to run away and never return. I was in love with their usual sarcasm with each other but this time, the sarcasm seemed almost as if it were real. I don't know, maybe that is just me.<br />Secondly, the storyline seemed very much rushed. I don't mind Arthur dying, but the way he went just didn't leave me feeling refreshed. Not all sad endings have to be depressed, some could feel hopeful. THERE WAS NO HOPE. He died, Guinevere became the ruler of Camelot and Merlin, who knows. I would have felt a little better with a little summary of what became of all the characters I love. It just felt so empty.<br /><br />I could have just been thinking too much into this last season and ended up ruining it for myself. It is worth watching if you want to see the final season but if you like happy endings as much as I, do not watch!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is more intimate, you feel almost like a voyeur into their intimate lives! It's so much more than sexual and I would love to know what happens next...TORTURE!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|At first I didn't wanna pay that much for a mouse but I went for it, and honestly it was well worth the money. I know use it as my primary mouse as well as my gaming mouse. The light on the mouse is really great there's a bunch of colors to choose from, you can even make your own color. Ou can also change the rate of the pulse of the light. I highly recommend it.

B0067TQQI8|5.0|The product works as advertised. I cannot get it to charge the phone while on charge, but that is not an issue for me. The only negative I have experienced is that the power tips supplied do not include one for the latest iPhone. Since I use an android, it really isn't a problem for me, but it did prevent me from letting a friend use the battery on his phone the other day (he did not have his power cord with him - one reason I am not an Apple fan). The 2A USB port is especially nice since it provides the higher current output. Anker offers smaller units and larger units. I found this size was a good compromise for me. I would definitely buy it again.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|As a long-time reader and fan of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, I wasn't disappointed with their latest entry in the Pendergast series (#12), but didn't have the same feeling at the end of it as I have with most of the others.  This book brings back all of the recurring characters in the long running series and each get their moment in the spotlight.  Pendergast rightly takes center stage as he should, but also appearing are his friend and ally, Vincent D'Agosta, his ward Constance Greene, Corrie Swanson, Pendergast's wife, Helen, and cameos by some other minor characters.<br /><br />In this novel, Pendergast frees his wife from the clutches of Nazi kidnappers only to see her taken again.  As he deals with this situation, Preston and Child creates sub-plots for the aforementioned recurring characters.  Some of these sidebars feed the main plot that Pendergast is part of, some are head shakers that may the reader to wonder why they are included in this book (as I did).  I know that fans of the series want to see these characters in each Pendergast novel, I just wish that the authors could have tied them all more closely to the plot.<br /><br />Preston and Child's writing is brilliant, as always, and the book moves swiftly along.  I really enjoy their descriptive scenes and wonderful vocabulary.  I really have only two complaints, though, about the book.  1)  Some of the later scenes involving Pendergast and the Nazis were really overdone and in need of an editor's red pen.  Perhaps, the duo was told to provide so many thousand words and had to stick to the plan.  And, 2) those unfamiliar with the series will have little clue about the back story and history between Pendergast and the characters mentioned earlier.  Not that this is all bad though, because it may cause the new reader to the series to go back and start with \\"Relic\\".<br /><br />Fans of the series won't be disappointed and should rush out and grab a copy.  Those new to the world of Pendergast will hopefully start looking for copies of the first 11 books and prepare for some great reading.efully start looking for copies of the first 11 books and prepare for some great reading.
B000002I2M|5.0|I was just 15 when it was released and Love Her Madly was playing on the AM every half hour.<br />FM radio played the uncut versions of the masterpieces LA Woman and Riders on the Storm.<br />The album was a refreshing change as they reverted Back to the Roots, adding Jerry Scheff on bass from Elvis' band. the only time a bass player was used, since Manzarek handled the lows on his Hammond.<br />I listen to this today on the eve of Ray Manzarek's passing. I harken back to a time where innocence was lost thanks to a drawn out war in Viet Nam, Jimi was gone, the Beatles were toast, Morrison not far behind.<br />Rock music and America would never be the same again.
B004SDEP38|1.0|Kindle all ready has something like this I don't need it also you can't make drafts if you want to edit great but not for me because I want to make drafts
B006M4RN3U|5.0|this is  a great gift for my students as an incentive for getting good grades;  the honor roll I make it a point for my junior high kids that they may get any requests  approved, that includes music. little bit potty mouth, but the parents  okay  this cd
B009V3KKXY|5.0|this was wonderful it helped me make use of all the extra paracord I was wasteing. I've made several of the monkey fists and its been the most simple way to accomplish this knot.
B0093X805W|5.0|Just finished reading it for the first time in probably thirty years, it was so much fun. I work with kids and I asked one to read it and I wanted to be able to talk with him about it. I'm so, so glad I read it. Surprisingly vehement anti-television sentiment expressed by the author. That may explain some of my delight with the book since I'm going on my third year without owning a television. What a great, great book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wanted to read this book before the movie comes out this fall. I didn't read the first book, just saw the movie. Oh my goodness I loved it! I really felt like I was with Katniss in the arena through Suzanne Collins' words. Can't wait to start book three, but I may go back to book one first. Loved it!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|IT DID NOT WORK!!!!!!!! NEVER GET THIS APP BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WORK!!!! This is a warning to you buyer's
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I purchased this cd  for 2 students, during break they listened to it. as  an older person &#34;baby boomer&#34; the songs  are  quick and upbeat , remind me of the 80's  will use seller again great service
B007MDB71O|5.0|I just do not get the bad reviews this movie got. I think it is great and pretty close to the book. I think they did a better job with the Tharks than the book or comics. I think it is a great movie.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Very interesting plot and decent acting. A little too much 'jumping around' and losing the main theme however. Okay to watch maybe once.
B004TI1WME|5.0|This calculator app is excellent.  It's extremely convienient in that I can easily add or subtract a %, (I use it at times to  add sales tax) as well as being accurate.  It's very attractive with beautiful colors & has a nice, large keyboard so it's easy to see.  I especially like the feature that allows me to run a tape so that I can go back and look at each amount being added....or subtracted.  All in all this is well thought out and very well done.  While I received this as the free app of the day, I would gladly have paid for it....it's absolutely worth the asking price.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Now, when my friends puff away on their E-cigarettes, I can actually light them with my sonic screw driver.  What a hoot
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Okay, so my mistake. I bought the book and started reading and I promised myself that I wouldn't watch the movie until after finishing the book. But I couldn't resist and I watched the movie before I was even 20% done with the book. Movie - good. I think the actors did a great job but the plot and filming wasn't super catching but I enjoyed it. Book - eeeehhhhh. i understand that this is Pat's journal where he \\"writes\\" to Nicki but it really does read like someone's diary and for a few chapters it's ok but it is also annoying once you are half way through. It feels like you are reading a monologue. And yes, I know it's a journal and you are reading Pat's words but he has comments and ideas for everything. There is dialogue between 2 charecters and Pat has input that is added in. Something happens between charecter and Pat has input to add in. personally, it's not my favorite type of novel to read.<br />Plus, again my fault, as I kept reading I kept comparing it to the movie and remembering the similarities and would dwell on the differences. It gets a little distracting.<br />I suppose I made it out to be some great novel in my head because of all the hype and reviews the movie created but I was left disappointed by both the book and the movie.
B004G6009U|5.0|I am an adult and I think this movie is great. It is funny, sweet, not really violent. Just a really cute movie.
B000FC10QG|4.0|Barbarians at the Gate is written almost like a documentary, so the pace is not a fast as a good novel, but it is full of interesting details about the world of corporate mergers and company politics. The good, the bad, and the ugly of American capitalism are on full display and admirable corporate leaders and disreputable corporate clowns alike are on parade across the pages.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This was my first Richard castle book .I love d it<br />I love the show so much.I'm glad I started reading this series.
B0012HEB32|4.0|This is very entertaining.  Our family love the sci-fi movies but this I would rate as one of top.  Sure hope they continue this series.  It's great.  Lots of death but not near as much as the original.
B005I548B4|3.0|I've read a few Nicholas Sparks books now and find them enjoyable but nothing spectacular. They are an easy read for those days that I need to take public transportation to work or the 2 days a week that I am alone during my lunch hour. They really are the basis/foundation for a good chick-flick. It's engaging enough to make you want to read on to the end but not such a page turner that you feel you can't be torn away when your lunch break is over. Although I do admit that the end is a bit emotional at parts and if you are an easy crier make sure you are alone for the last 2-3 chapters. You don't want to cry in public.
B00CBRADU2|3.0|I grew up a child of the late 80's and 90's watching and enjoying Arnolds movies so I looked forward to his return in the lead role for Last Stand. After watching the movie I have mixed feelings. Its good to see him again in the kind of role that made him famous, but it just isn't the same anymore. Much of that has to do with the movie being too campy at times with a convoluted and unbelievable storyline, but its also hard to watch one of your childhood action stars literally become too old to play a role like this convincingly, which is made worse by the mediocre story and directing. There are portions of the movie that are fun to watch and a few good jokes, but overall I felt unsatisfied at the end. There is a reason this movie was a bomb at the box office. Maybe some of that has to do with today's generation only really knowing Arnold as a politician, but its also because the movie just isn't that good. True Lies was a great Arnold movie that was able to be a serious movie and have great laughs at the same time. The Last Stand is a pale shadow of that. This movie is good to rent and watch for some decent action, but many true fans of Arnolds work will walk away sighing remembering the old days and better movies.
1400069742|3.0|Olson writes well, and Those Angry Years is a lively and accessible treatment of its subject-matter; the book, however, struggles to hold its material together and has little if anything original to say. Though it starts out by introducing FDR and Charles Lindbergh as the main protagonists in the great contest between interventionists and isolationists, Lindbergh disappears from the narrative for long periods and Roosevelt never comes to life in Olson's hands. In contrast to these two remote figures, Olson has more to say about (and seems much more interested in) Wendell Willkie and Anne Morrow Lindbergh. Here we find the book's structural and thematic problem: switching back and forth between analysis of partisan politics and the stories of a totally apolitical individual like Anne Morrow Lindbergh or that most un-angry of politicians, Willkie, it fails to achieve a convincing synthesis. Consequently, Olson comes up short on conclusions and, instead, indulges a final reverie on Mrs Lindbergh that would be better suited to a hagiography on that subject.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|Honestly I have not seen it yet.. It was recommended to me.  Also the other version was one that I wil get at another time.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this is a amazing book and I have never been disappointed by this series I have read this series all my life and can't put it down.
B007ZCOJRQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I have to admit that there were points where I felt I could relate and even felt a little disgusted with myself. It brough back memories of Ally McBeal and the image of Portia. There really were moments where you could see but they did a good job of covering up. What I didn't like was that rushed feeling at the end. A lot of explanation of measuring the food and the self image and then the struggle with the recovery and meeting Ellen and the family support...I felt that all that was smashed into the last few pages like an afterthought. If Portia is going to do a 2nd book with that part of the story, then I can understand but if not then I think there should have been a few additional chapters.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I saw the movie first (which is not typical for me), but I still think the book is superior. I really enjoyed the first-person narration here. It made the character more authentic and the story more captivating. Would recommend!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Damian Stevenson's \\"The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada\\" is pretty much a James Bond novel whose hero is the creator of James Bond, and it's a great, entertaining read.<br /><br />The story is taken from the real life of Ian Fleming, who before he became a world-famous author was an agent for British Naval Intelligence in World War II (his actual actions provided the inspiration for the Bond novels).  The story centers around the fate of the French navy in the wake of France's conquest by Germany in 1940.  The question: who would take control of the powerful French fleet?  The Germans, who could use it to augment their own forces, challenge the Royal Navy and possibly invade England?  Or the Allies, who could then turn the ships against the Nazis?<br /><br />Agent Fleming is dispatched to France to find the commander of the French navy, with an offer.  If he turns the ships over to the British, he gets to retire in England with two million pounds and a title.  If not, the Royal Navy will send his fleet to the bottom of the sea before allowing the Nazis to get their hands on them.<br /><br />The mission includes all the twists and turns we'd expect from a Bond story: secret gadgets; chases and fights in cars, motorcycles, skis, and boats; and of course women who can't resist the hero's charms.<br /><br />The book is written in a style very reminiscent of the Bond novels.  The author has clearly done his research; details of every description fill the book and immerse the reader in Fleming's dangerous world.  As the story progresses, we see echoes of the future James Bond in Fleming's actions and his words.<br /><br />It's a very well-written, exciting and fun book, and (especially if you're a Bond fan) I highly recommend it!
B004LWZW24|4.0|This movie was very good.  I have already recommended my friends to watch it.  It has a good story about a father and son relationship.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great fun to read, even for someone who is not a gamer.  Cline creates a likeable protagonist and exciting story.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|I was a fan of the NBC series Sunday Night Mystery Movie....Columbo, MacMillian & Wife, McCloud.  Glued to the set and enjoying each minute. Pleased that I was able to get the complete series and the movies.  If you are a fan get it, buy it, enjoy it.<br /><br />P.S. I don't love inanimate objects.....
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all that Grisham has written and this is my second favorite after his first book A Time to Kill. Great story woven through a great plot line.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I'm not sure why I passed this one by years ago. It is a profound story if survival and of &#34;creating your own reality&#34;. It also speaks to how we may be repaired by life for experiences about which we haven't a hint. Profound, wise, beautifully written.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|I just have to say I love Liam Neeson in any movie.  He is a fantastic actor.  I own alot of his movies.  This movie could have been a little better though.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Wow, really cool special effects and very interesting story line.  I loved this movie and would recommend it for anyone to watch.  Adults and kids.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Was not sure after the first few pages but then I got caught up in the story and really liked it. Quite thought provoking.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I recommend it to all!! It had a perfect story and would be awesome as a movie!
B007REV4T8|5.0|We have here, at last, a Bond film that dares to be more. In 50 years, we've learned next to nothing about James Bond's history, not much about his relationship with M, or, for that matter, that much about her. But this film really delivers.<br /><br />The story centers around a washed-up Bond, who, after a spectacular opening sequence, is missing, believed killed. But once a cyberattack strikes at the heart of the Secret Service, Bond returns from the shadows, and M, despite her better judgment, sends Bond back into the field. Along the way, we encounter a villain who is the man M made him, a ghost from her past, and the unexpected consequence of making the hard decisions.<br /><br />Sam Mendes, who introduced Daniel Craig to American audiences in &#34;Road to Perdition,&#34; moves the story along at breakneck speed, but he's smart enough to know when to slow it down so we can catch a breath. Roger Deakins' cinematography is top notch, and should have won the Oscar. Thomas Newman's score is a marvel, showing an understanding of the Bond films' history, appropriate nods to John Barry, and a Newman Hollywood pedigree is used to the full.<br /><br />Both Daniel Craig and Judi Dench bring all their powers to their respective roles. Craig has given us the character Fleming created at the opening of his novel &#34;Thunderball,&#34; in which Bond has become a borderline alcoholic who just doesn't care anymore. In Craig, we have a Bond who looks like he's lived the Bond lifestyle. Dench is a marvel, a lioness fighting for her career and the lives of the agents under her care. If anyone would ever have won an acting award for a James Bond film, it would have been Dench.<br /><br />Watching this movie melted 40 years away and I was 15 again, thrilling to every frame, feeling every bit of the roller coaster ride that the best Bond films are. This ranks with &#34;From Russia, With Love.&#34; Don't miss it.<br /><br />Those wanting a fuller review are welcome to go here:<br />http://sseitz.livejournal.com/2012/11/11/ttp://sseitz.livejournal.com/2012/11/11/
B006P0FD4W|3.0|Well it was just another spooky somewhat movie.  I just thought it couldnt have been a better storyline.  I own nbr. 1,2 and now 3.<br />I would probably recomend it to people interested in these kind of movies.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|I loved this movie!  It is so deep and really makes you think.  My husband got lost a few times and didn't like it as much as me, but he did like it.  I would definately recommend this movie to anyone who likes to think about life and death and the hereafter.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book is masterfully written. The plot is exciting and indepth, and the style of writing is refreshing and beautiful. I would highly recommend this book to any reader.
0887431461|5.0|My grankids love learning with these books. Great book to start your little one out on. they don't want to stop ounce they start
B001OQCV6A|5.0|A great movie with Downey and Jude Law having fun. The sound track is awesome, a mixture of classic Victorian Era violin and orchestra to bawdy roadhouse and Irish songs.
B00BSIOOM8|5.0|But many buyers of this are ticked off because of a track listed that's not actually on the remaster. The track is called Cold Harbor. I read some stuff on a music forum related to this very issue. Rock Candy (who did the remaster) says that it was a technical error on the printing which has a correction on subsequent releases. The CD content is no different from the original release.<br /><br />As such, one member of that forum said that he may have figured out the 'bonus track' issue. Rock Candy also did a remaster of the Outlaws album Soldiers Of Fortune. On the Outlaws album is a track called Cold Harbor. It's also Track 5 which is also where the Blue Murder remaster lists Cold Harbor. The guy figures that this is the screw-up.<br /><br />Other than that, I was pleased with the release. Some say it's compressed too much, but I found that the sound was good. I don't have time nor the inclination to always cross-check Cd sound levels with Audacity. I have better things to do. If it sounds good, then it is good.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|I have tried a bunch of these type apps to fall asleep to. This is one of the good ones I can listen to and feel rested and relaxed. Happy memory's to all!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is so good because you earn money and buy upgrades. Also you can buy vehicles and buy different stages.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Fun movie and everybody liked it at our house!<br />Definitely kept us entertained!  It was a good , clean movie also.
0988178532|5.0|I won a copy of \\"Outview\\" by Brandt Legg through the Goodreads Giveaway Contest. This book was amazing. This is a coming of age thriller with elements of reincarnation,meditation and magic. I travelled to another dimension.<br /><br />Nathan Ryder is sixteen in grade eleven living in Ashland, Oregon. He had lived through at least a hundred death's since the \\"Outviews\\" began a year ago. His best friend, Kyle is two years older from Vietnam, and Kyle's cousin, Linh, is a grade behind them. Nathan and Kyle both lost their father at a young age, which creates a bond between them. Dustin, Nathan's older brother was committed by Nathan's mother...for being crazy...hearing voices.<br /><br />But now Nate confides in his friends, to tell them about the Outviews...his secret. Nate tells Kyle that for a year he has had these nightmares, they seem real, and he hears voices. Nate is stressed out and needs to go and see his brother who knows the truth...before it is too late for the Overviews to take over Nate's mind.<br /><br />The characters are both naïve and believable. The author weaves the story with a strong foundation, and amazing plot and builds the momentum by releasing information on a need to know basis. Although the book is geared towards teens, I feel that any age group would enjoy this story. I am looking forward to the next books in his trilogy.
B000026ALX|5.0|I am a great fan of Leonard Cohen, who has finally become a legend in the U.S. He had reach legendary status in Europe long ago and in his home country of Canada some years ago. His songs are not for everyone's taste, some require a bit of thought. The songs on this CD were recorded during a drug and alcohol induced haze at the Phil Spector studio in Hollywood back in 1977. Phil Spector, the genius, crazy guy who went to jail for shooting his girlfriend. An HBO movie recently appeared with Al Pacino in the title role. After the recording was finished Cohen said he never ever wanted to have anything to do with Spector again and he never did. These songs don't appear on any other CD to the best of my knowledge.
B00957T6X6|5.0|storylines are easy to follow. theres a character for every persons favorite type of novel. sansa for your romance, brom for your mystic, tyrion for the bad guy might be good senario, dany for your heroine, and then so many more
B008S4YZCO|5.0|so addictive!  I can't stop playing nor can my 3 year old she loves the 3d monsters and creating there names.
159102594X|5.0|I picked this book up as a stop gap while waiting for George R.R. Martin to finish his saga. It took a couple of false starts but by the third try, I was awash in Abercrombie's characters and plot lines. His story is entrancing and I panicked when I realized that I was reaching the end and I had not purchased the next two volumes of the trilogy. Crisis averted by Amazon Prime and I am set to conclude the tale in the next week.<br /><br />No author is perfect and some will find that this is not their cup of tea but my criteria is that, within the world of fantasy, I want to see some realism. People have sex, evil rulers torture people, characters can't always be pigeon-holed in a role of good or evil. Abercrombie gives you that realism. Some characters have high ideals and low morality in their methods. Others just want to be left alone but find themselves thrust into incidences of heroism.<br /><br />If you enjoy fantasy but you're not so keen on a fairy tale, this read should leave you satisfied.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book changed my life in many ways.  E. Tolle does a tremendous job describing fairly complex phenomena in simple everyday language.  He is German and that actually helps because his words are so easy to understand.
159463176X|5.0|\\"So, then, you want a story and I will tell you one. But just the one. Don't either of you ask me for more.\\"<br /><br />That's how [[ASIN:159463176X And the Mountains Echoed]] begins. It grabs hold and doesn't let go until the end, at which time you won't be ready for it to be over.<br /><br />Built around a perspective-shifting narrative that covers the sweeping scope of six decades of heartbreak and triumph, [[ASIN:159463176X And the Mountains Echoed]] is at its heart a novel about people. I think it might be Khaled Hosseini's masterpiece; it's hard to imagine him exceeding it.<br /><br />If you liked the [[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]] and [[ASIN:B0084I2PEO A Thousand Splendid Suns]], you're in for another literary treat of the finest order.
B001D57C0C|5.0|Within Temptation is such a wonderful band.  Sharon's voice is so pure and beautiful, the layer of symphonic sound over driving heavy rock rhythms is marvelous.  They are willing to experiment and work with songs, searching for new sounds, crafting lyric stories.  Adore it.
B000025SL5|5.0|This soundtrack is just what I expected from Vangelis. Very passionate music. I highly recommend for any one easy listening.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Awesome job on creating this game it so great I'm all ready on level 29 and I got in 2 days ago.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I enjoy watching this movie. Started out slow but the pace pick up.  The 3D dvd was outstanding.  I would recommend it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found this game hard to put down. I did get stuck several times so I resorted to a walkthrough but that's only because I was just do didn't want to think very hard.  Still very fun, loved the graphics...very clever!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This book is fantastic, it never gets old and always cheers me up. It is a book that any generation can appreciate
0143036742|5.0|I laughed my way through this book.  I lent it to a friend, thought it was lost forever and found it again on Amazon.  Thanks.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great series, too bad they didn't do more episodes. The series just leaves you hanging with unfinished relationships. Doesn't really end the story.
B004WE01YA|5.0|This movie is one of all time favorites.  Now in 3D!  I hope to see more of this.  I Excellent movie 3D is outstanding!
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|Greg and his family in this book is very crazy! Man, he's worse than me!  :) ;)<br />P.S. Pleas tone down the crazy in Manny.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|Pretty good movie for an &#34;End of the World&#34; story.  I think this will eventually end up being one of the camp classics...good for a sci-fi movie.  Great special effects and good acting.  I would recommend this for fans of the genre.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I really enjoy playing the game is a good idea for your friend.share this story your family it does a big deal little people.
0525478817|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry (on the inside) and moved me. It was perfect in every single way possible. It explored death in a way that I had never thought of before, and put the important aspects of life into perspective. John Green is one of my favorite authors and was even before this book. But after I put it down, I felt like I could have read it again. I'm going to end my review now because I can't possibly describe the amazingness of this book to you in words and eventually I'll just start making words up. So, baisically, read it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I want you to meet Drew Evans, the most handsome guy-book that I ever read and the funniest one too. He is a playboy, rich, work hard and knows he is good at what he does. But we met him at his lowest moment: he has the \\"flu\\". Let's just say he was being a guy with a broken heart and didn't have the courage to get the bull by its horns and admit he is his worst enemy.<br /><br />Then, we met the cause of this illness: Kate Brooks. She is just like him: driven, intelligent, beautiful, doesn't take crap from him, but...she is engage to be married to Billy, a musician.<br /><br />Kate and Drew started as competitors, then evolved to friends (even though they didn't realize that) and just fell in love with each other, but since we are reading Drew's point of view and he is a man, we have some serious problems along the road because he couldn't read the subtle lines that Kate through at him.<br /><br />As I was reading this tale, I really thought Drew was just at my side, showing me some film or photos about every detail he commented and lived. I think this point was brilliantly written by Mrs. Chase (really well done).<br /><br />So, I loved this one! It's funny, insightful (the male mind is interesting) and fast.<br /><br />You should read this book and understand everything that I said here and much more.
B005T87QCI|2.0|The game is a rip off you have to pay .99 cents each to get more and better robots it is a good game though.
B000DBHXG0|3.0|Got this movie for the kids.  They like it, but I could only give it 3 stars, it's a pretty cheesy movie.;]  It does play well on the PSP and wasn't pricey, so I pleased with it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Although i am aware of the depravity that took place for all of those years, I found the description of those acts of cruelty a little hard to take in.  At the age of 70+ , I tend to look for books with a minimum of violence. But the story-line is exceptionally good and, of course, the ending was perfect. I  a like feel-good, every-one wins end. I will read another McKenna book.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I've seen this movie several times but bought this one because two guys that I work with have never seen it. They loved it too.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is amazing it is fun and challenging  the lag is at a minimum and only starts at the 75+ levels this is the best game ever GET IT!!!!
B00C061I3K|5.0|I was hoping we'd get an album of this caliber after the masterpiece Tron soundtrack. RAM has some swagger to it. It's not your standard bass heavy metronome Electronic. This album has composure, and after one pass you can hear how well thought out it is. Even though I've been a fan of DP for many years, I think the true genius of their music started with Tron, and is continued here. Time to start it again....
B00000JSJC|5.0|I gave this rating because I liked Science Fiction and a good detective story mixed in (a basic who done plot). I enjoy the idea of black market memories being sold on discs. It's like the old porno store around the corner in the old days. The story is about an actual memory that was being recorded when it unexpectedly records the killing of a poular singer by corrupt cops. As the two corrupt cops try to kill off any witnesses to their crime, two other ex-cops, (who are friends) become involved in the scenario that looks like they are trying to protect the only witness left alive who has seen the murder on the disc. Later in the story there is a falling out between them in an excellent who done it characteristic movie ending.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|Having never played any similar games, I was a little list when the game first started.  Fortunately I had read several other reviews and realized there was a tutorial.  It only took two games to beat the computer opponents but that was also on level 1 (of 4).  I'm looking forward to working my way through the levels.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|My kids liked this for a month or so.  They did get bored and do not play it anymore.  Not a bad game!
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|I really liked this movie and it's plot story of the entire society using cyborgs by their owners to go about their daily activities at work and play while they stay safe at home. There is no risk of physical harm to the owners who want to do dangerous things or kinky things. That is until a one of a kind military device is stolen which can not only disable the cyborg but kill the person who is using it. This story seems very plausible to me since already many people are using the internet to work from home, socially connect threw dating, on line chats, and live in a virtual world of their own choosing. I just see society taking the next step with cyborgs that will allow humans to make their fantasies into reality. You won't be disappointed with this movie.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Really fun only it gets a little repetative with limited space. But was fun with a few friends. I would love a few skins!
1449410243|4.0|The poster included was worth the price! Hopefully no one on my Christmas list reads this review yet, because this book fits a lot of my family (you know who you are, and which cats I'm talking about...)
B000ZNRBK4|1.0|In the past I purchased a poor quality lens hood for half the price of this hood. This item is listed as being a Nikon Hood which is what I was expecting but not what I received. I received another cheap knockoff marked with \\"for Nikon HB-45\\". I am very disappointed as I now have two cheaply made hoods and still don't have the official hood I was expecting. This hood much like the last doesn't seem to fit properly and is difficult to take on and off.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|they did really good on the design and gameplay on this game but needed to make accumalating currancy easier and that would have put the game over the top.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|You should definatly get this app! Don't you think they should make more characters for it! That would be awesome! If you don't have any pacients then maybe you shouldn't get this app. But it is really fun!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Freezes often. Great game w/chat, gain many friends. Love the trading. What a puzzle. Possibly more bingo tokens per day.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is a fun series to watch.  It is good to have the entire series plus the movies.  The best part of Columbo is trying to find out how Columbo solved the murder before he does.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Although I do not agree with everything Vic Mackey does, It sure is interesting to watch him work. The stress he endures from family,  and work,the danger of the streets and keeping his secrets safe will make your heart pound with suspense. The acting is superb, and it makes you really address what you think is right and wrong.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is amazing game. I love all the different horses. I wish that I could be part of the game. I wish it was easier to get some extra gems. Sometimes I want to play the game all day.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|The show is great!  It will keep you on the edge of your seat!  You won't want to turn it off.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This film is a really good film for children as well as adults to show that goodness is not lost, and that being good is not being a loser.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought this item based on the review from ReeVueBoi and I agree that this is a MUST especially if you are an audiophile. I bought the Soul by Ludacris SL300s and I was a bit disappointed that I could not hear the mids because of the way the headphone was manufactured... Problem solved. Not only can I hear the mids, I can hear everything. If you are someone who loves all types of music then the 1st EQ setting with no LED is your setting. If you are a Bass head then the 2nd EQ setting with the Red LED is your setting. If you want both extra bass and clarity then the 3rd setting with the blue LED is for you. I did not find any use for the 4th setting which is the purple LED. Honestly, after using this item I can't go back to listening to my music without it. But word of caution, there is some static if you are using a smartphone/tablet and are streaming your music via 3g/4g. If you have a wifi connection available for your smartphone/tablet, use that to avoid this annoyance. Enjoy. :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game of all time. $7.00 is a great deal for this game. the possibilities will never end. its all about the creativity that is waiting to come out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yup...love it. It's a good story. Very hot scenes. Fantasy love story. I would totally recommend this as a read.
1449410243|4.0|cats secretly do plot to do things, and this books is a tell-all of that behavior!!  Do not let your cat read it in case it gives him ideas.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|so far the game has nice graphics (as always)  but the timing for the sound is off by like 10 to 15 seconds,  which throughs off the entire game.  Hopefully it will fix itself throughout the game.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit is my favorite book.  I have read it more than 30 times.  It was the first thing I downloaded to my kindle.  The movie is very well done and is true to the book.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This purchase was the ultimate buy for me. I grew up watching Columbo.  Now I'm able to enjoy Peter forever.  When I saw this as the \\"Deal of the day\\" I purchased it instantly.  Thanks Amazon!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Love his books.  Kept me mesmerized - (SPOILER ALERT) this one has a strange plot ending which I thought was not quite up to his normal standards, but it was a good read!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|it works great! theres lots of backgrounds and frames. I use this for scrapbooking. plus its free!!!! cant beat that.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|We all do things, say things, feel things we know are bad or are not right.  We blame, we regret, or we wish.  So what? We are who we are, and if you read this book and do not feel you have taken this journey with Cheryl than you haven't done much living.  Beautiful.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Fantastic follow-up to the 2009 reboot.<br /><br />The story follows in the same vein as the previous installment, with Kirk continuing to be the reckless captain we know and love, while Spock provides the more serious foil to this. We get a nice build up, a perfectly executed villain (seriously, no idea who Benedict Cumberbatch was before this, now I want to see everything he has been in), a few nice twists that you don't see, a few obvious twists that are very nice nonetheless. The graphics are stunning, the acting is fantastic. I saw this and Iron Man 3 on the same day with someone, and we both agreed without question this was the stronger film.<br /><br />Basically, if you liked the 2009 reboot, watch this, you'll love it. If you didn't like the 2009 reboot...see this anyway unless you absolutely hated it, because this was still much better (I liked 2009, but still, this is better).
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I find it unacceptable that this game which isn't graphically intensive or anything, overheats my Nexus 4!! Why?? Fix something!
B00A81MV3U|1.0|First let me start by saying Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, and Jennifer Lawrence are great.  Bradley is the best Actor to hit the screen in a long time.<br />The first hour of the movie is fantastic and original and very true to life.  The second hour turns into Dirty Dancing, Flash Dance and 29th Street.  Its a great original story turned into the same old story.  By the way, when a family has a loved one with a serious mental disease the last thing they are doing is watching and caring so much about commercial sports.  It just falls apart when they all meet in Bradley's living room after the Eagles Game.  It just took the fire out of the story. And the Therapist sitting there made me cringe - so stupid. They made him look like a fool.(Fun Fact: It is true that most Therapists in America serving the low end Middle and lower classes are Indian from India.)
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Fits very well<br />Love the color. Makes it easy to carry.<br />Would order again in a different color.<br />good product.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This show is hilarious! Highly recommended to those who love humor! I have all 5 seasons (bought from amazon) Can't wait until season 6 is on DVD!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is on of the best alarms I ever used so ya I think you should use this and plus it is for free yeah free what's up
0812993845|5.0|Charlotte \\"Lottie\\" Graveney is devastated. Immersed in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend, Richard, she is positive that he's going to propose marriage to her at long last. After all, what else could it mean when he says he has an important question to ask her over lunch at a fancy London restaurant? Unfortunately, popping the question was the furthest thing from Richard's mind. Instead, he only wanted to discuss air miles. Now Richard is bewildered and Lottie is livid.<br /><br />Embarrassed, disenchanted and at her wit's end, Lottie immediately breaks it off with Richard and tries to readjust to single life. But starting over again isn't easy when she's already in her early 30s and longing to settle down. Is it too much to ask to have a home, a husband and a family at this point in her life?<br /><br />Enter Ben, her wanton lover from the gap year she spent in Greece when she was 18. Though theirs had been the perfect relationship, Lottie and Ben were divided by the realities of geography after that magical interlude and lost touch with one another for the last 15 years. When Ben blazes back into her life proposing that they marry one another, Lottie jumps in eagerly with both feet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Lottie's sister, Fliss, and Ben's friend and employee, Lorcan, are dead set against this impromptu union that seems like nothing less than sheer madness to them. Desperate to stop the wedding, Fliss and Lorcan join forces to break up the happy couple before they can tie the knot. Unfortunately for the pair, their plan fails and the wedding goes ahead as intended.<br /><br />Heartsick at her failure, Fliss knows firsthand the misery that an unsuitable marriage can bring and is determined to keep Lottie from living unhappily ever after. In the midst of an all-consuming divorce from her estranged husband, Daniel, Fliss vows that she won't allow Lottie to make a matrimonial mistake of her own.<br /><br />Not to be thwarted, Fliss concocts another strategyto stop Lottie and Ben from consummating their marriage, making an annulment a possibility if only she can talk sense into her little sister. To that, however, she must jet off to the Greek island of Ikonos where Lottie and Ben are trying their best to enjoy their honeymoon --- but everything seems to be going wrong for the newlywed pair.<br /><br />To top off the hilarious scenario, Richard has come to the conclusion that he made a major mistake and is determined to declare his love to Lottie in person before all hope for a future together is lost forever.<br /><br />WEDDING NIGHT is an engrossing novel in which everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Filled with laugh-out-loud moments, this is Sophie Kinsella at her wittiest. With her usual ability to place her characters in the most eye-popping, embarrassing situations and frantic predicaments, Kinsella puts the entire cast through their paces before they achieve their happy endings in surprising ways.<br /><br />Reviewed by Amie Taylor
B0019IB0II|5.0|I bought this book to read after suffering a stroke myself.  Very well written and informative.  Gives a bit of hope for future recovery.
B0030BYWKU|3.0|I bought this album about 2 1/2 years ago when I liked pop, hip hop, rap, and similar genres. I thought this album was great. I liked all but 1 song I think. Then I discovered the Beatles and I absolutely fell in love with them. I then started disliking rap, hip hop, etc. So based on my opinion pre-Beatles, I give it a 5 star rating, but based on my opinion now, I give it a 1 star rating because eve though the message of all the songs is good, it's still just generic hip hop. So I'll average it with a 3.
1250007208|4.0|I enjoyed reading Cinder by Marissa Meyer. A science fiction take on the traditional Cinderella story.<br />The Cinderella in this story is known as Cinder and she is part cyborg. There's romance with the Prince, the evil step-mother and complications. Cinder has a hard time hanging onto her metal foot yet seems to be able to slip in and out of the place too easily. There's a plague and the evil Lunar Queen thrown into the story. At times the story is over simplified and yet I had to read on. Ok, it's not a great story but I liked it and can't wait to get my hands on the next book.
0670014893|5.0|John le Carré brings us a new psychological thriller that casts his cynical eye toward the Kafkaesque world of espionage, right-wing politics and bureaucracy in A DELICATE TRUTH.<br /><br />Operation Wildlife, a top-secret, bloodless mission to extract a dangerous jihadist weapons dealer on English soil, is put into action by the British Foreign Office under direction of a brash new Scottish Member of Parliament. The MP appoints Christopher Probyn, a middle-aged, seasoned and trustworthy Foreign Officer with no cloak and dagger experience to be his eyes and ears during the operation. A team of American private security contractors out of Houston and a smooth-talking CIA operative who is a friend of the MP have been secretly contracted to work with an elite band of British Special Forces troopers to snatch the arms dealer from a seaside apartment in Gibraltar.<br /><br />Probyn is provided with a false name and identification, and tucked away in a hotel room to await further instructions. When he is finally contacted, he is outfitted with night vision goggles, an ear piece, an encrypted cell phone and binoculars, and transported to a windy cliffside to report to the MP as the mission plays out. Events turn dodgy for a few minutes, but after some frantic communications and a brief burst of gunfire near the extraction site, the mission appears to be accomplished. Everyone involved gets an \\"Attaboy,\\" promotions and new assignments, even a Knighthood to Probyn, the clandestine eyes and ears of the MP. Above all, no one is to even whisper the name \\"Wildlife.\\"<br /><br />Three years later, things start to unravel. One of the Special Forces British soldiers on the mission has cracked over the emotional strain of something that definitely did not go right that fateful night, and is threatening to blow the whistle. Toby Bell, the MP's private secretary, has never heard of Operation Wildlife. He is handed a cryptic message received by Sir Christopher Probyn who was recognizedby the soldier from the mission at a local fair. Sir Christopher wants to discuss the message and its meaning with the MP, but keeps getting stonewalled until he reaches Toby. Together, they learn that the cover-up, if exposed, could mean the end of the careers of several high-level Foreign Office officials.<br /><br />le Carré, a master of the psychological thriller, has created a cast of duplicitous characters so facile at spinning events to suit their needs for deniability, you never know who, if anyone, can be trusted.<br /><br />The world we live in is as fraught with danger as it ever has been. With the end of the Cold War, the killer-thriller action novels have evolved to reflect the new enemy, filled with superheroes and whiz-bang weapons in exotic Southeast Asian and/or African locales, roaring with helicopters, humbees and gunships, explosions and futuristic weapons. These translate to blockbuster action movies that reek of gunpowder and death. le Carré relies on nuance, complex plots and sophisticated mind games, creating edge-of-your-seat suspense without the bells and whistles.<br /><br />le Carré's iconic espionage thrillers span over 50 years, with more than 20 titles, including THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD, TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and THE CONSTANT GARDENER, all of which were made into movies. He has not lost his touch since he created George Smiley in CALL FOR THE DEAD to rave reviews in 1961. His grateful fans rejoice that at age 81, he continues to create novels on contemporary subjects that keep you guessing to the last stunning page.<br /><br />Reviewed by Roz Shea
B004I744AS|5.0|Excellent learning tool also enjoyable for word games. I use it daily for learning understanding and writing. Recommend as a learning experience for all.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|If you can see this movie in IMAX 3D I urge you to do so, but not necessary. I loved the first remake of the Star Trek saga, and because of it have eagerly anticipated the new movie for over 3 years. The only way you wouldn't like this movie is you don't have any feelings (lol). Seriously, probably the die hard purist might not care for the tweaks to the story but you SHOULD like the movie and think you probably will. My wife and I are thinking of when we are going to go see it next!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. However, I think I enjoyed the first one a little more. This book is crazy good and exciting. You will never want to stop reading.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book.  I have to say that Emma Chase is a HUGE talent when it comes to nailing voice.  (And - frankly - nailing other things...an observation Drew would appreciate, I'm sure!)  It's hard (again, Drew's influence in my head!) to stay this faithful to a character, but Emma Chase pulled it off.  And how.  Sophomoric pig Drew learns how to love in one nail-biting scene after another.  And you laugh at him (and with him) and you root for him, and you just hope he doesn't screw up things with Kate.  And you know they'll end up together, but the journey sure was fun.  AMAZING debut - can't wait to see more from Emma Chase!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Its pretty fun but my only complaint is that the game has some glitches but it will going away after a few minutes.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Very intuitive mouse and the punch to zoom function is very useful. Great vnc client.<br />Just wish we could connect to alternate displays on Linux servers (ex. server_address:display)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game! Good storyline and graphics. Easy enough to be enjoyable challenging enough you don't feel ripped off. It does skip a bit but not enough to be frustrating. overall, I say great way to pass the time.
B008JFUP0I|4.0|Usually, the longer a film franchise carries on, the more diluted it becomes - eventually leading to recasts, reboots, and whatever other attempt movie studios can think of to preserve their moneymakers.  Just a few of the franchises that have had to reinvent themselves over the years includes James Bond, Batman, and basically any of the popular horror series.  Outside of the horror genre, most of the series additions these days are above average or at least average in terms of quality, with The Dark Knight and Skyfall being a few of the best examples, compared to Batman & Robin and Die Another Day being examples of their polar opposites.  Now, let's turn our attention to the Fast & Furious franchise.  After the release of The Fast and the Furious (2001), the franchise clearly took a tumble without Vin Diesel in the driver's seat, spawning two mediocre (yet successful) sequels before \\"rebooting\\" with the original cast in Fast & Furious and Fast Five.  The majority of that cast returns once again in the fifth sequel, Fast & Furious 6.<br /><br />Directed by Justin Lin (Fast & Furious, Fast Five), Fast & Furious 6 stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, along with Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner - reunited once again when Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) approaches them for help to take down a rival crew, run by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans).  Shaw's crew also includes Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Dom's former girlfriend that was allegedly killed while assisting the FBI - who has been suffering from amnesia since her supposed fatal car accident.  With official pardons being used as collateral to clear their names, Toretto, O'Conner, and the rest of their crew must assist Hobbs in stopping Shaw and his crew from stealing components to assemble a devastating weapon that would have the ability to knock out electronically crash an entire region.  Jordana Brewster, Gina Carano, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Chris \\"Ludacris\\" Bridges, and Tyrese Gibson also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />After the conclusion of Tokyo Drift, it would have been hard to imagine the Fast & Furious franchise surviving long enough to make another film - but here we are, three sequels later with another on the way in 2014.  To be honest, Fast & Furious (2009) didn't have a whole lot going for it other than it reunited the original cast, but it was enough of a commercial success to spawn Fast Five, which is by far and away the best film of the franchise.  With that being said, it was always going to be a massive undertaking to exceed the entertainment value of Fast Five.  However, Fast & Furious 6 definitely gives Fast Five a run for its money - due in large part to the addition of another crew that is just as talented as Toretto's crew, not to mention the return of Michelle Rodriguez.<br /><br />Fast & Furious 6 is basically split down the center with two different plots coinciding with one another, the first being the crew assisting Hobbs to take down the Shaw gang, and the second to return Michelle Rodriguez's character to her once prominent position as one of the franchise's main characters.  The Letty storyline is a bit silly when you really think about it, but then again the whole franchise is pretty silly in itself - since basically all of the characters should either be dead or in jail.  Still, the storyline works enough to get Rodriguez back in the mix and to be completely honest, the franchise was really lacking the role of a dominant female that Gal Gadot and Elsa Pataky had been desperately trying to fulfill in the past two sequels.  Now that Letty is back in full swing, ***SPOILER - it should be no surprise to see that Gadot and Pataky were essentially written out of the franchise by the conclusion of Fast Six***<br /><br />It's not as though the Fast & Furious films are overly impressive with the overall quality of acting or meaningful dramatization (they star Vin Diesel and Paul Walker for cryin' out loud), so it shouldn't be too surprising that these films have taken on a watered-down, soap opera-ish feel to them.  Regardless, viewers are obviously invested in these characters, clearly having fallen in love with them and continuing to want to know what happens to them.  At the same time, you have to wonder how long these films can keep going at the rate they are progressing - because no matter how many times a character says their predicament presents \\"another level\\" of difficulty, it still feels the same as the last film.  That's not to say these films aren't exciting, because they absolutely are, but the more action these films dish out, the harder it will be to get to the finish line the next time around.<br /><br />The best part of these films (outside of the cars) is waiting to see in what direction the story will be taken next.  Like the popular Marvel films, the Fast & Furious franchise has adopted the \\"scene after the credits\\" to help set up the lead-in for the next film.  For example, Fast & Furious was a direct lead-in to Fast Five, while Fast Five's ending saw the return of Eva Mendes to drop the bombshell about Letty still being alive - and well, Tokyo Drift supposedly taking place out of order is just plain strange (especially since viewers already know the ultimate fate of Han).  How does Fast & Furious 6 end?  Well, you'll have to go to the theater to get the answer to that question, but let's just say a HUGE A-list actor will be taking the reins in Fast 7 as the main villain.  This scene also ties up a MAJOR loose end from Tokyo Drift that wasn't even a loose end at the time.  Sound confusing?  Well, go watch the film and ask questions after.<br /><br />Overall, Fast & Furious 6 is a terrific addition to the franchise, featuring no shortage of big engines, big thrills - and a rather large tank.  Team Torreto continues to hit on all cylinders and will easily cross the finish line at the box office with another victory under their belt - paving the way for next year's sequel (which everyone will be clamoring about after the final scene of the film).  Feel free to buy your tickets in advance, because Fast & Furious 6 is a MUST SEE.<br /><br />Overall Grade - B<br />FNDNreview.comave taken on a watered-down, soap opera-ish feel to them.

B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I want my money back! I'm not kidding! When you find yourself forcing you to view a movie, it probably sucks...save your money. Makeup was well done, 1 star.
B00C061I3K|5.0|As soon as I heard those first 15 seconds of \\"Get Lucky\\" during a commercial break, it was love at first sound. Only Daft Punk could give me 15 seconds and yet tell me so much about what was in store with RAM.<br /><br />Yes, this album might be considered a departure, but the right type of fan is not likely to see it that way. Discovery, arguably their most popular and highly praised album, was Disco House 101 as far as I'm concerned. They weren't making raw disco tracks, they we're creating something new out of something old and bringing attention to these forgotten classics. How many of you went looking for Edward Birdsong, or George Duke after hearing their samples on Discovery? Maybe this was your first foray into disco music. Maybe you liked it and wondered where disco went after all these years.<br /><br />Wonder no more, RAM is here. RAM is disco circa 2013. It's not samples, it's not overly filtered and processed, it's brand new disco for a new generation. This album isn't just for fans of Daft Punk, it's for fans of that funky disco sound who have been waiting for it to make a comeback all these years.<br /><br />You can really hear Chic influences on tracks like \\"Give Life Back To Music\\", \\"Lose Yourself To Dance\\" and \\"Get Lucky\\", while Daft Punk's signature electronic sounds can be found in \\"Game of Love\\", \\"Within\\", and \\"Contact\\". The rest of the tracks present a wonderful collaboration effort from Julian Casablancas (Instant Crush), Panda Bear (Doin' It Right), Giorgio Moroder (Giorgio by Moroder), Paul Williams (Touch), and more.<br /><br />The album really feels genuine. Less like a tribute album and more like our 2 robots found a time machine and went back to the 70's to create this magical funk odyssey. Sure to delight if you have a single funky bone in your body, still lace up your roller skates for 70s night, and have a soft spot in your heart for 2 music making robots.

0062238868|1.0|I'm a big war-book lover and have read many of the great classic of all wars (pacific, vietnam, world war I and II, cecenia and so on..)<br />Let me just say this is not an interesting book. There is no action at all, no reflection on the effects war has on human, no considerations or emotions. there are only 400 pages of garbage about how much Kyle loves war, his fellow marines, his country, God etc etc etc. Nothing wrong with that, he is a SEAL after all and I expect they receive a fair amount of mind-conditioning before leaving for war, but a couple of pages would be more than enough to say what he has to say.
0812993845|3.0|I usually love Kinsela's books, and I was entertained with this one. However, a woman scheming the entire book to prevent her sister from having sex was kind of strange! I enjoyed the side plot between the sister and groom's friend, but come on is that all Kinsella could think of?
B003FSTN7A|5.0|I just love it. If you are into paranormal. You should see it. Some episodes I like more then others. But the overall is very nice.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you liked the Myst games &amp; visually stimulating logic puzzles, you'll love The Room! Great puzzles, great graphics. My only complaints were (1) the game wasn't very long &amp; (2) I wish the hints worked differently. There were a couple of times I just needed a little direction &amp; I never knew when I would get my next clue. Maybe having a hint button would be more efficient. Otherwise, loved the game &amp; can't wait for the next!

B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  It promotes many unhealthy and dangerous practices.  1.  showing kids beatng up on another kid.  2.  showing adults having sex in front of a child.  3.  talking about sex practices in front of a child.  Ths was in about the first 2 minutes.  This was so bad that my husband and I turned it off in total disgust!<br /><br />NO ONE should watch this movie.
075669812X|1.0|This book was clearly used before it was sent to us.  Pages were folded and yellowed.  Looked water stained too
B002QS5OQ4|4.0|I'd rather not go into too much detail, but the show itself is very different from its predecessors, but entirely interesting and worth watching at least once. I enjoyed it enough that I want to own my own copy and be able to watch it whenever & share it with friends, but not every Stargate fan seems to share my opinion. If you haven't already seen them, I'd strongly recommend watching the Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis TV shows before this one, because while it is almost entirely different & the story is going in new direction, its build on the foundation of those shows as well as the original Stargate(1994) movie.

0988262592|5.0|This is a groundbreaking book. Both the way it's set up (as a novel) and the topics it addresses (business relevance of IT, devops, agile, lean, ToC, collaboration) this book is a MUST-READ for everyone in (or dealing with) IT. Of course, the storyline is too good to be true, it does not address any resistance from the workers (only some managers) in the organization. But who cares...the story is compelling, innovative and marks a new era for organizing IT and dealing with business issues. Period.

B00CL0J99K|3.0|I am not entirely sure where to begin my review. Iron Man 3 starts off unusually with our favorite hero Tony Stark/Iron Man narrating in the film. And honestly I immediately had a flashback to how Spider man 3 started off and when I heard Tony Stark narrate I was worried. I gave Iron Man 3 a chance and while I would not call the movie itself a waste of time or complete garbage, It was a little disappointing. Yes this will be one of my first bad reviews unfortunately. Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Don Cheadle, return and I think they all did a great job portraying Tony, Pepper, and Rhodey. Now on to the new additions: we have Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, and Ben Kingsley as Mandarin. They all did good in the movie. And with such a big cast you may be wondering why Iron Man 3 is getting so much criticism? Well here it goes.<br /><br />I am not the biggest Iron Man fan, but the problem with Iron Man 3 is that the cons outweigh the FEW pros it has. Starting with the much talked about \\"twist\\". God I really hated the twist in Iron Man 3. It was really childish, surprising, entirely unecessary, and just plain wrong. It just made the movie a lot worse. Another problem:IRON MAN was not in the movie enough. Sure Tony Stark's presence is Constant; but this is a SUPERHERO movie. The script was also rather...lazy in some aspect. The movie has its moments, but ultimately it just doesnt have that WOW factor that we are so used to with Marvel movies. Now on to some pros.<br /><br />Say what you want, but Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow have great chemistry. And it does show in Iron Man 3. Which takes me to my next statement: despite the flaws that are present in this movie, Iron Man 3 is more serious and SOMEWHAT more thrilling than Iron Man 2. And finally, I am glad this movie was not any longer than what it was because it could have been a even BIGGER mistake for the movie. It should come as no surprise that I myself will be in NO rush to buy this when it comes out on dvd. I think the question that is on everyone's mind is: do we need/want an Iron Man 4? Sure but please bring the WOW factor and make a better movie the next time around.Seriously.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 is no 5 star movie, and it is not even a 4 star movie strangely enough. But in my opinion Iron Man 3, whether you love it or hate it, gets:<br /><br />3 starssh to buy this when it comes out on dvd.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Cannot say enough about this book! It shows mental illness in a different light. It addresses the stigma surrounding depression, anger, the need to see a therapist, and medication. Pat and Tiffany are two very messed up people and two very lovable characters. Read this book! Just do it!
B005D0RDKW|5.0|seen the old dogs since hold your fire. This tour was my favorite and this DVD does not hold back either. Begging to end with the Rash vids (before-break-and after the show.) was supprised they added those on the dvd.  The Rio dvd rocks as well. But this is a MUST HAVE and if your trying to decide. Time Machine is there best dvd to date..<br />buy it.. buy it.. buy it..

B002VPE1WK|4.0|The overall quality is fine, seems worth the money.  The problem I have with this pack is it's too small for me.  I'm 5' 10\\" tall and wear a size 40L top coat size.  The straps that fit on your shoulders are too short for someone my size or larger.  I was able to adjust them out all the way and they barely allow me to get the pack on.  Because they're short that ends up making the bottom of the pack too high to rest on my waist and allow some of the weight to fall on the hips and the padded waist belt on the pack.  I also would have preferred to have substantially more padding on this hip belt.  The strap intended to fit across the chest ends up too high and feels like it's choking me, without anything in the pack.  I would estimate anyone over 5'8\\" will find this pack too small.  Otherwise, for the money it's a good deal.

0937381888|5.0|I am totally happy with this book.  I am also happy I did NOT order the Kindle version (as you can read in the other reviews).  I am only a couple of months into Home Brewing and so far have only done Extract brewing.  I love it, thus, I decided to bite the bullet and go all the way into All Grain Brewing, which I know nothing about.  I watched a few youtube videos, and talked with my favorite Brew & Wine Hobby employees - then I set forth and ordered my Stainless Steel Kettle & Burner, a mash tun, and a SS paddle.  All I needed was 'something' to reference as I go along.  This book came highly recommended ~ after reading through, and double checking my personal equipment... I'm doing well :-)  Now, I'm just waiting for my equipment to be delivered TODAY!  YIPPIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE :-)<br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL BREWERS!

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This lovely story pulled at the heartstrings, plucked at the funny bone and suckered with our fumbling humanity. I will remember.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I highly recommend this incredibly fun and hilarious game in which the player is a shark that must eat in order to stay alive. A player begins the game as a small Reef shark, and eating boosts its size ten levels. As the shark eats, grows, and collects in-game coins, the shark types evolve: Reef>Mako>Hammerhead>Tiger>Great White. Each evolution enables a shark to swim deeper and to eat items that previous types could not eat.<br /><br />I am currently a mid-size Mako shark, and all my coins are from simply playing the game--there is no need to buy coins or jewels if you enjoy playing and are willing to level up at a measured pace. You will earn free coins and jewels by eating items such as fish, crabs, sea predators, swimmers, scuba divers, people on rafts, people on boats, etc. There are also in-game quests which earn players more coins. So, if you are not the impatient type, just play to earn!<br /><br />I play this app on my Kindle Fire. The sound effects are top notch, game control is very smooth, graphics are excellent, and players may choose to control the shark via touch screen or tilt. I got the game for free, and would gladly pay up to $5 for it--it's THAT much fun!
B008US4PBY|5.0|I picked up my first Cronus device when there website cronusdevice dot com was still up however right now it's down for maintenance. I wanted another because I plan to give it to a friend, they liked it when I dropped by with mine thought it was cool and I told them I would get them one.<br /><br />I don't use the software provided by Cronus, I use the software at gamepadproxy dot com to use it you first have to force your device into programming mode and update the firmware through their software. To force programming mode I think it was a double tap on the reset button, the button is on the under side of the device and you will need a paperclip or toothpick to get to it because it is accessed through a small hole as is common for many electronic devices with a reset button.<br /><br />If you need any help with it call their customer support line and tell them you need to force it into programming mode to use the old gamepad proxy software. They walked me through it and it worked for me.<br /><br />Side note/last minute thought the usb cable that came with the one I got from Cronus was defective and so at first I thought the device was defective, if you can't get yours to work try using another cable.<br /><br />TO USE THIS DEVICE ON AN XBOX 360 YOU MUST HAVE A WIRED CONTROLLER FOR AUTHENTICATION. I can't make that any clearer please don't complain about it, it is stated at the end of the product description and if you didn't read it that's your fault, don't down rate a product because you didn't read the description.<br /><br />Ok, when I get mine from amazon if anything goes wrong I will come back and let you all know.

0062014536|1.0|I loved the first two books and I was so excited to read the final book. I was so disappointed! Little focus on developing the characters and a lot of unmemorable action scenes. Little to none interaction with Alex and nothing to really make JuIlian stand out as someone to root for.  The book ends so abruptly. Nothing feels resolved between anyone. I almost wish I hadn't read the first two books because I am so disappointed with this final book.
B003VANOFY|5.0|the sound quality is incredible especially when you active the &#34;surround sound&#34; feature on it.  my friends say the mic is very crisp and doesnt pick up a lot of chatter. has about a 6 hour battery life on it? the power cord that came with it doesnt seem to work right, it could be the USB slot but I have moved it around a few times and it doesnt seem to charge it properly.  When i use my android mini usb wall charger with it, it charges very fast (a time that you would expect it to)<br /><br />it also has a pretty large range.  i have a fairly big apartment and can walk from my room to the otherside of the apt where the kitchen is and can continue my skype call or music.<br /><br />fits very comfortably and doesnt get too hot like some other over the ears do.

I did not expect some of the turns which is why this book is such a good read. GRRM is excellent. He isn't afraid of building a character only for a time then the character disappears. Love the series. Just hurry with the next!!

B00BN0Y4JY|2.0|I saw the Horizon program and immediately ordered the Kindle edition of the book.<br /><br />The idea is great and sold me to the extent that I am now on the 5:2 intermittent fast.  But the book is disappointing in many ways.  All the information you need was in the program -- the only substantive extras are the references to the scientific studies, the food calorie tables and the recipes.<br /><br />Frankly, the substance of the intermittent fast could be explained and concerns answered in 10 pages. As an ex book editor I can see the tell-tale signs of padding out: repetition of the same information over and over, the FAQ that repeats everything again, the true-life endorsements from those on the diet, and the overbright, verbose, upsy writing (mainly from Mimi Spencer).  More recipes and less bumf might have added some substance.<br /><br />What is absolutely astounding is that the authors seem to be unaware that more people use the metric system than Imperial measures. Amazon sells to the world so the text needs to address the requirements of people using different units of measure.<br /><br />How much trouble would it have been to include quantities and other measures also in metric, between brackets?  Looking at the side of my five-grain porridge packet I see the energy content given as 1450 kJ per 100 g, so this has to be converted to Calories (strictly kcal or kilocalories) to compare them with oats in the tables of food calories in the book. All these tables needed was an additional column for kJ (kilojoules) and the rest of us would have got some use from them.<br /><br />So don't bother buying the book for the calorie tables -- you can get all this information for free from the public health administrations of governments around the world.  Just to help you out, to convert Calories to kJ, multiply by 4.18400. So 500 Calories (2092 kJ) for women on fast days, and 600 Calories (2510 kJ) for men.<br /><br />It is unforgiveable that Michael Mosley -- doctor, science program maker, and communicator -- should have allowed the omission of metric measures to happen. There are some strange anomalies; for example, you must know your height and mass in metric to calculate your BMI (body mass index).<br /><br />Kindle Edition<br />The Kindle edition has some special faults all its own.  These are due to the clueless publishers having no idea that navigation is key in ebooks. Take the many cross-references to *page numbers*.  Hello publishers, don't you know that the notion of pages in ebooks is meaningless -- it's all one long flow?  But the page numbers aren't even hyperlinks. Yes, you can click madly away on them and nothing will happen. A summary table of Contents gives an overview of the book, but it also needs an expanded Contents showing all the subheadings to help you get around.cience program maker, and communicator -- should have allowed the omission of metric measures to happen.

B001RUXW48|5.0|It was a movie that brought out many emotions and kept the audience interested.  The characters chosen for this movie were well chosen. This was the first movie that I ever watched with Amazon on my computer.  I am glad that my monitor screen was a 21 inch.  I am looking forward to watching it on my TV with the DVD player.<br /><br />I do not know if it is possible to watch on the Cable Box that I have with Warner Cable.  At least, I have not tried or read anything about downloading from anyone other than from Warner Cable a movie.  I do not at this time have a Blue Ray DVD player either.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Short Review: Yes! That's more like it!<br /><br />Longer Version: I was surprised how much I liked this new Trek movie. It had more elements that made Star Trek.. Star Trek. Such as, caring about the Prime Directive and at least talking about exploring the universe. There is still, for me at least, too much FLASH/BOOM in the movie, but that's what audiences want to see apparently so you are in for a treat. Lots to see, great sets, awesome visuals, the CGI is top notch. I won't go into the specific plot points, but I'm guessing the next movie will involve some angry Klingons! The designers also introduced a new look for the dress uniforms which involve a Bitch'n hat that Spock wears smartly in a few scenes. Look for them this Halloween ;-) Oh, one last note, there is no reason why the Star Trek and Star Wars universe couldn't cross paths just once. I would love to see Spock body slam Annie. *Peace Out!*
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's a little slow and jumpy, but overall, a good game. I like playing it on the kindle because of the larger screen

B0034G4P4Y|4.0|Great graphics, fun story, and it's a well made animated film. It's fast moving and will definitely entertain most of the family.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when I heard the cast line up. Did they get the role because they could sing or because they had box office draw. As one reviewer noted, the CD is even better than the movie because you are not distracted by this fact and can listen with clarity to the vocals and it works. They did justice to one of the best musicals ever made.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a really good, well written story.  You loved the characters and wanted them to get together and stay together.

Most likely you already heard the abum.<br />I imagine this would be one of the best examples of this album one could purchase.<br />I know, iknow, you vinyle heads will make your &#34;warmth&#34; analog arguments.<br />In my opinion, if you do not have a serious turntable... and everything that goes with taking care of viynle..etc, then what is the point? I get great sound from DVD-A and SACD on my system. I would have to spen thousands to get a turntable, pre-amp, and all the rest to satisfy, if I went back to the black circle. Thanks all.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved this book! I laughed, got a lil teary  a few times. I loved Point of View from Drew...it was real, witty and totally raw. It was not your typically romance novel and I loved it! A must read!
B004QSQMKE|3.0|This is a great movie; just be completely sure you want the director's cut and not the major-release version. If you intend a trip down memory lane I recommend getting a different version...this cut lacks the Tangerine Dream soundtrack and goofy feel-goodness of the theater version. If you want to see a gritty, serious Legend as Ridley Scott intended; this is for you.

B006YTTVHO|3.0|I did learn some useful tips I didn't know, like approaching people that look happy or are having a good time, but I did not like the emphasis on positive thinking and not being negative. Nor do I appreciate being chastised for spending a lot of time doing things on my own (like reading books, watching TV, being in front of the computer, etc). The author seems to think that popular people are popular because they like being around people, I disagree completely. Popular people are popular because they're good looking, outgoing, charming, and extroverted. An introvert is not going to become popular unless he becomes famous, then everyone will like him even if he's a pain in the ass. I admit I read this book because I rarely have a good time at networking events, parties, and other outings, but that doesn't mean I'm unhappy or I have to become a social butterfly to be successful in life. However, maybe a better approach is to socialize in small groups, like Chattanooga's \\"Connect for Lunch\\" program where you meet with two or three business people during lunch. I do wish the author had included alternatives for those of us who dread crowds. Either way, there's some good advice here, it was a fast read, so maybe you'll love it, maybe you won't.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|I was expecting more. All of the religious references are detracting. And it seemed there was a desperation in trying to build a story around a spectacular event.

Of course, Matt Damaon was very good as the psychic, and the build up, although a little slow in development, seemed appropriate for the plot.  People who are interested in NDEs will not be disappointed.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Fast paced and enjoyable. Not the best Le  ICarreI have read.A little bit of proselytizing  about intelligence and operations which go awry.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out in the 70s.  It was just as good as I remembered.  Plain, clean, silly fun with a plot that kept me guessing.  This is a light, fun comedy with some detective twists.  There's a variety of characters that are fun to see.  I think it's a very entetaining movie.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Let me be honest, I love the work of Daniel Pink. This book is not exception.<br /><br />Pink starts out by telling us how his book is for more than just salesman. The reality though, is that everyone is in sales. You may not make cold calls or get people to buy things, but you are seeking to motivate people everyday. Whether that is a boss, a child, a spouse or a friend.<br /><br />For leaders, this concept is enormous, but it is even more important for pastors. Every week, when a pastor preaches, they are seeking to move people. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, they seek to help people move from where they are to their next step with God. This takes motivation. According to Pink, this takes sales. While pastors will bristle at this idea, it is also true. Call it motivation or sales, it is the same thing. According to Pink, \\"The average person spends 40% of their life trying to move others. We're persuading, convincing, and influencing others to give up something they've got in exchange for what we've got.\\"<br /><br />One of the problems Pink points out that we have when it comes to communicating is that we don't help people identify the correct problem. This is huge for preaching, helping people see what they could fix. Pastors often answer questions people aren't asking, and therefore don't move the people they are preaching to.<br /><br />Another takeaway for me as a preacher is helping people to see what a truth could look like in their life 5 years from now. I've started to say in sermons, \\"Imagine what your life would be like if you believed ____________.\\" People are often unmoved, not because they don't understand something, but because they can't see the benefit or goodness of something.<br /><br />Here are a few things that jumped out:<br /><br />-One of the most effective ways of moving others is to uncover challenges they may not know they have.<br />-To sell well is to convince someone else to part with resources--not to deprive that person, but toleave him better off in the end.<br />-The correlation between extraversion and sales was essentially nonexistent.<br />-You have to believe in the product you're selling--and that has to show.<br />-Once positive emotions outnumbered negative emotions by 3 to 1--that is, for every three instances of feeling gratitude, interest, or contentment, they experienced only one instance of anger, guilt, or embarrassment--people generally flourished.<br />-Next time you're getting ready to persuade others, reconsider how you prepare. Instead of pumping yourself up with declarations and affirmations, take a page from Bob the Builder and pose a question instead. Ask yourself: \\"Can I move these people?\\" As social scientists have discovered, interrogative self-talk is often more valuable than the declarative kind. But don't simply leave the question hanging in the air like a lost balloon. Answer it--directly and in writing. List five specific reasons why the answer to your question is yes.<br />-The problem we have saving for retirement, these studies showed, isn't only our meager ability to weigh present rewards against future ones. It is also the connection--or rather, the disconnection--between our present and future selves.<br />-The third quality necessary in moving others today: clarity--the capacity to help others see their situations in fresh and more revealing ways and to identify problems they didn't realize they had.<br />-We often understand something better when we see it in comparison with something else than when we see it in isolation.<br />-So if you're selling a car, go easy on emphasizing the rich Corinthian leather on the seats. Instead, point out what the car will allow the buyer to do--see new places, visit old friends, and add to a book of memories.<br />-Clarity on how to think without clarity on how to act can leave people unmoved.<br />-The purpose of a pitch isn't necessarily to move others immediately to adopt your idea. The purpose is to offer something so compelling that it begins a conversation, brings the other person in as a participant, and eventually arrives at an outcome that appeals to both of you.<br />-Questions can outperform statements in persuading others.<br /><br />Overall, a worthwhile book for leaders or preachers.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Peter Falk was perfect for the role of Columbo.  He made you laugh, cry and always wonder what he was going to do or say next!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|What a fantastic movie. I have watched it in blue ray and the digital copy several times now and it never gets old. Amazing graphics in blue ray. A must have for anyone who likes action movies or great graphics in movies.
0817439390|5.0|All you need to know is right here in this book as far as understanding exposure. I have read two books before this one and still found myself confused and looking back. This book explains it to you the way it should be explained, simple and to the point. I read this book a year ago and after reading it I can now expose properly and it shows in my images. All the other books get so involved in technical aspects that it becomes confusing. If this book were about driving a car it would tell you, this is the brake, push on it and the car will stop ,the harder and quicker you push the harder and quicker it will stop. Other books would say, this is the brake, it runs from your from the car floor to a lever that compresses fluid which is compressed into hoses that lead to the calipers which compress against the rotors etc. ...you get the point. Both explanations will get you to the same understanding but only this book will leave out everything that is absolutely unnecessary. When your shooting you only care about getting the proper exposure on what you want your final print to be this book will get you there.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|This is a thoughtful movie masquerading as a sandal-and-sword movie. It is set in Alexandria after the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity. You do not watch this film because it has cool fighting scenes. You watch this film if you are interested in ideas, like the role of religion at the time, and even more generally. Many of the Christians behave like today's Islamists, for instance by burning books and attacking women.<br /><br />Historically, the movie is fairly accurate, even though some of the events in the movie did not happen simultaneously at all. Clearly the film is critical towards religion. At one point the bishop says the following: \\"I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.\\"<br /><br />We should cherish our right to freedom for both women and men. This film shows that it is something worth fighting for.

B001BKVWYG|4.0|My son mentioned the documentary on Rodriguez to me and I was able to watch it and was absolutely amazed at this kind and talented man.  Music is good and hard to believe he couldn't sell in the 70's as he is Dylanesque
B00C061I3K|2.0|Let's be honest, this album SUCKS!!! I'm a old, hardcore fan of Daft Punk, after the little fail of \\"Human After All\\" I was expecting the redemption of the duo, but no, sadly, this never happened. This album has, in my opinion, 5 great songs, tops:<br /><br />-Give Life to Music<br />-Giorgio by Moroder<br />-Lose Yourself to Dance<br />-Touch<br />-Contact<br /><br />Go ahead, buy it, only if you like pop stuff like \\"artists\\" of MTV, but if you're like me, eclectic, old/classic/french house/daft punk fan. Pass it.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is not your average science fiction novel. True, it is set in a futuristic Earth under threat for alien invasion but that is where the stereotypes cease. Ender Wiggin is a brilliant young boy, a forbidden \\"third\\" child who is selected to join an elite group of soldiers at a young age. When those in high ranking positions begin to see Ender's potential, they take steps that will change his life forever.<br /><br />Ender is not your typical protagonist. He is a child at the start of the novel, and barely a teen at the end of it. His intellect and maturity is beyond his years, and is forced to mature far faster than some of his colleagues after he is admitted to battle school. He is not the brute that his older brother is, nor the tender-heart that his sister is, but (as the government notices), a perfect blend of the two. As such, Ender is tasked with joining the ranks of young children and teens who must train to fight the Buggers; an alien race which our planet has been at war with for years. The children are divided into \\"teams\\" where they train under and fight alongside other children until they are either promoted or \\"iced\\".<br /><br />What makes this book more than your typical science-fiction novel is the psychological element. The various government officials you meet in the books all have their own agenda and not all of them are immediately transparent. They are willing to manipulate children to achieve their end purposes and the reader has to contend with some morally conflicting situations. While I read this book first as a young teen (perhaps 12 or 14), I got much more out of it when I reread it as I got older. Now as an adult I can appreciate many of the intricacies I could not as a youth. This book is (in my opinion) an appropriate read for a ~12 year old boy or girl, but there are many moral, social and psychological aspects of the book which may elude them. There are themes of social isolation, psychological warfare, and political anecdotes that may be confusing to a young teen. Additionally, there is some violence and brief mentions of nudity which may turn some parents off. That being said, I think many younger readers would be able to read it without issue, albeit a more shallow understanding of the deeper themes.<br /><br />The conflict in this book parallels many real-world issues presently, from political strife and propaganda to wars being fought when neither side is fully aware of why they are fighting the other, only doing what they have been told. This book is worth a read. It is well written, timeless and engaging. You do not have to be a science fiction fanatic to appreciate this novel.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I picked this up shortly after hearing some of his story and was blown away by it.  No wonder it won the Oscar for documentary of the year.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I think this is the best unlimited endurance game yet. better than subway surfer if you like shooting type endurance. it chalenges  your multitasking skills
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I love this movie so so much.  I originally watched it just because I knew it had the song Mad World by Gary Jules in it and for some reason that was enough of a reason for me.  The story is wonderful and there is so much more depth to the movie than many people realize.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I work in information technology, so I'm often called by family and friends for random electronics and computer issues.  This tool has become an essential tool for people trying to solve their WiFi signal troubles.
B00364K6YW|4.0|Colin Firth makes any movie worth watching.  This is a very good rendition of this movie, but with Firth, it becomes so much better.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I'm an ALIEN fan (the first two films) but ignored all the marketing hype that went with the release of PROMETHEUS and recently watched it on my home screen.  It's not the screenplay I would have conjured; however, since I failed to catch the promotional materials, I did not feel resentful or misled.  I skimmed a few, mostly positive reviews that encouraged me to catch it.  As usual, art direction triumphs over substance.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This is by far my favorite musical (one of the first ones I ever made it through), and I love it beyond words.  You will want to buy the soundtrack once your are done with the movie!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Awesome combination of Star Trek history and new ideas. The special effects in Blue Ray anc 3d are incredible. I highly recommend .
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Tom Cruise redeemed himself with this movie. Even though the stunts were totally unbelievable, it was actually good fun to watch.  The well-rounded team of other actors balanced the movie and it wasn't just about Tom Cruise's character which was great.  The Mission Impossible movie by far. I always think the funny moments are great to throw in to offset too much action/drama.

B003JIPJRE|5.0|I must agree with the majority.  This was an excellent animated movie, worthy of a theatrical release.  There are many excellent Batman movies, but if you must buy only one animated movie concerning Batman, this is the one to puchase.  You won't be disappointed.

0547848412|5.0|I had already seen the  movie, The Life of Pi, and found it intensely fascinating.  The book was also wonderful.  The author's choice of words and his writing style flowed smoothly.  He described scenes with effective detail and even though I had seen the movie, I liked the experience of reading the story.  The movie was beautifully filmed with graphic shots of PI  and the animals.  The book gave me more insight into Pi's thoughts with the written word.  I enjoyed the book as much as the movie.  I would recommend it whether a person had seen the movie or not.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love this game!! it is always interesting!!! new goals everyday.. and yo<br />u don't have to spend money to enjoy it...<br />Very addicting;)

B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! Just wanted to read again before the movie comes out! Even better the second time around! Can't wait
030758836X|3.0|The book told the story of this married couple who moved from New York City back to the husband's small town in Missouri.  It tells of his wife's adjustment to the return his home and her relationship with his mother, sister, and father who suffers from dementia.<br />The chapters alternate between narratives by Nick, the husband, and Amy, his wife.  She disappears at the beginning of the novel and her husband, who has been cheating on her, doesn't seem overly distressed to the townspeople and police.  I didn't expect the structure of the book to use the alternating narratives by Nick and Amy.  It still tells an interesting story but I found it a bit plodding.
B00BUT5I84|3.0|This is a interesting album to put into words.  This is a band that started out with a very raw and unique sound.  Today they have an even more unique sound, but has the band aged well?<br /><br />If you listen to all of the albums in order you can hear and appreciate the transition that 30 Seconds has made.  If you would listen to this new album after only hearing the first album, you would not know that it is the same band.  Gone are many of the heavy guitars and drums from the first release.  Programmed drums and loops of synth sounds abound on this release as they did on the previous album.  At times it sounds like a move soundtrack and in a way that is what they have created.  A soundtrack for our lives.  Is it the same sound...no.  But one thing always remains with 30STM, raw emotion.  Leto sings with full emotion again.  If you are looking for more of the same, you might be disappointed, but why would you ever expect \\"the same\\" from this innovative band.  My only let down is the return for the children backup on many of the choruses.<br /><br />I think after 100 listens through I might have a different take on this release.  I miss the hard rocking heavy guitars that I first fell in love with but as with most things the more time you spend with it, the more you will understand it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is awsome so many great ideas and pics that you can pick from who ever came out with this is a genious. :D

If anyone out there would like to buy the dvd that has a region 2 dvd player or an all region player,it's in perfect condition(never even watched)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is hands down the best game I've played in a long time. It is hard enough to make you think, but not so hard that it's frustrating. There is a help button that points you in the right direction without giving away to much. I am looking forward to the sequel already. Definitely a quality game with a lot of thought and work put into it.
0300169787|5.0|I loved the cover on this book!  Book came in great condition.  Fun to read!  Great pictures!  I recommend this!
B0036S4C6G|2.0|Weird, sick, depressing. Are drugs really that prevalent? Is the music business really that dishonest and squalid? Will the future really be that horrible? If so, leave me out.  I wouldn't have finished reading it if my book group  wasn't discussing it, and if it's a fair example of Egan's writing, I'll never read another by her.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Two disk special edition DVD - better than the bluray.<br />Second disk detailing the making of the movie is fascinating.<br />Service from seller and e-bay top notch.<br />Quick delivery - product in excellent condition.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I know everyone hates this version, but I love it! A couple of the characters are a bit over the top, but I just love how they casted Anne, Wentworth, and Lady Russell, among a few others. The music is beautiful. Most of all though, I love how Anne's pain was conveyed and her internal struggle! Love it!
0300179553|5.0|Added this to my fashion collection section.<br />Nice addition to the other designers.  Book came in very nice condition.  Thanks!
B005S9EKCW|2.0|The success of Les Miserables hinges on the chemistry and power of the two lead characters, Jean Valjean and Javier.  Miss that dynamic and the musical will spiral down a pit of unrecoverable failure.  This over hyped Hollywood blockbuster rendition broke the cardinal rule and ends up a flat, boring, directionless mess of a musical film.<br /><br />The obvious issue is Russell Crowe is abysmal in this performance.  It's not his fault.  He's a decent actor but should never have been in this role.  Javier needs to be an energetic, powerful man of convictions and hatred.  Not only could Crowe not sing up to the standards demanded of the role but he doesn't even act.  Most of his performances have him standing rigidly squeaking out his lines and not even coming close to anything of the stage variety.  Javier has probably the most powerful songs in the production yet Crowe couldn't take advantage of that.<br /><br />Then add in Jackman.  Jackman has stage experience but again this role doesn't seem quite right for him.  I blame direction for this.  Jackman has to move from spoken word to singing on several occasions and it just makes the whole experience seem awkward.  I felt Hugh could have sang better in this performance.  He is passable but I would rather have seen him in Javier's role as it would suit him better.  Perhaps the nail in the coffin for Jackman is his most pivotal scenes require him to go up against Russel Crowe.  Valjean needs to stand up to Javier and play off his power but the two are a close match.  Here in this production you can tell Jackman could easily overpower Crowe and so Hugh holds back.  It really makes for some awkward screen moments and wasted opportunity.<br /><br />That leads me to the biggest problem with this film.  It has no direction at all.  It feels as if the director just grabbed the biggest name actors he could get and just let them do whatever they wanted.  There is virtually no chemistry between any of the characters.  Its as ifthe scenes in the film are the first time the actors are actually working together.  This is all wrong.  All wrong entirely.  Carter and Cohen's roles of the crooked innkeepers are prime example.  Both of these actors are capable of crazy characters but they are completely flat here.  Carter was the biggest disappointment as I really thought she could bring something to that role.  When I read some reviews here about how marvelous they were I almost choked.  Cohen is a mess.  His lines are all out of sync and there is no chemistry between he and Carter which was a major shame.  The only duet that seems to have any chemistry is Marius and Cosette.  Beyond that all of the scenes just feel cold, broken, and bland.  Even the slam dunk bar scenes are a mess.  I just couldn't shake the constant feelings that these scenes were lackluster outtakes rather than finished product.  Real shame.<br /><br />The highlights of the film are decent cinematography although it is repetitive.  The score is virtually the same as the musical so little has changed there and the ensemble cast is as good as always.  The biggest irony is that out of all the star power in this film it is Samantha Barks (Eponine) that walks away with the best performance although Anne Hathaway did surprise me for how well she did considering what I expected from her.<br /><br />In the end I just think this movie had no direction.  It's truly the worst rendition of this masterpiece I have ever seen and I have seen this a lot on Broadway, off broadway, even high school productions were better than this.  The actors cast just were not up to par with the quality of what the roles demand and worse, the director is so poor he exposes their weakness even more by putting them in awkward scenes with broken cadences and strange spoken word segments.<br /><br />Les Mis is all about the chemistry of the roles.  Valjean v. Javier.  Eponine v. Cosette v. Marius.  The innkeeprs v. the world.  These dynamics are imperative tosucceed with this production and the Director completely missed.  Better voices would have greatly improved this busted vision of a classic but I think a better director would have made significantly better choices even with poor acting.<br /><br />If you must rent this but skip it otherwise.  So many better productions of this story out there.  A big budget is not all it should take.  This isn't even a movie.  It's a collection of dress rehearsal lackluster outtakes roughly edited together to resemble something of video.
0792846443|4.0|I think anyone that loves a suspense movie this is a great movie for you.... I loved the talent in the movie which made the movie seem more realistic.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham's books are always adventurous and The Racketeer is no different. From the beginning he teased me into thinking I knew how the story line would play out. Instead I stayed up very late while vacationing in Tuscany (!!) to finish this book. It is a page turner and exactly what I wanted.

B007TKT2SK|5.0|Super easy to use and well designed.  Makes measurements much faster to contend with. I have nothing more to say on the matter.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book completely deserves the 5 star rating, I'd put 10 stars up there if it were allowed! This book is fascinating, once I started it I couldn't put it down. The author does an spectacular job at keeping the reader guessing, and throwing in a twist or turn at the perfect moment! For this price you can't go wrong and I promise you once you read this you be searching for more material from this author!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have been a fan of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels for awhile.  Some might think of Harry as a detective that has exceeded his prime, but the old school work efforts he employs are enjoyable and the mysteries are not easily solved.  He works the book, and the reader, to create a great work that makes me keep reading.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I bought this book yesterday and stayed up way too late last night (or this morning, rather) to finish it and it was sooooo worth my struggle to wake up this morning at a respectable time considering my kids wake up at the crack of dawn.<br /><br />Drew and Kate...I loved these characters the second they were introduced in the book. Drew captured my attention for his sarcastic, cocky point of view on just about everything. I must say that I truly loved reading this whole book from his POV. Kate was very lovable, funny and ruthless where her competition with Drew was concerned. She is one of my favorite female lead characters because she wasn't helpless or annoying.<br /><br />A sexy, witty take on the classic schoolyard crush dilemma of torturing someone you love because you don't want them to know how much you really love them. I will be recommending this one any chance I get!!! Loved it!!!!
B0055QYKQO|1.0|Board has so many gliches. First harddrive detection had problems took week of research and giga tech support to work around, then ethernet lan problems took 3 more days. Seems like the chips in this board have a mind of their own and do not respond correctly. week later..now i have problems with os when starting computer up. when opening files or folders, musicplayer or video would free up and lag. All other components are genuine, new and top of the line, so yes, its the board. Stay away if you know whats good for you.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|So far, it's been flawless. The screen is easy to manipulate and it's fast. I'm having some difficulty double-clicking, but nothing to lower my rating of it.

B007R41E8O|4.0|I really like the Twisted Lands games - this being the first one.  The story is intriguing, the puzzles are hard and the game creators create a very creepy atmosphere with the artwork and music.<br />Unfortunately, the game doesn't always work well on the Kindle Fire.  It has a very large initial download and it seems to get bogged down too easily.  Occasionally the Fire will freeze up so completely that a reboot is required.  When I do that the app seems to become damaged and won't reopen.  Reinstallation means losing all of my progress.  I really would like to see the bugs fixed in this a d future titles.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy the game but I mistakenly deleted it from my kindle so now I start over.  I wouldn't if I didn't find it enjoyable
B00BYISRC0|5.0|The National have had a remarkable career.  From their whiskey drenched, eponymous debut album, to the brazen vocals and menacing drumming of Boxer, they had already proven themselves.  Trouble Will Find Me doesn't break any new ground, but a band like The National doesn't need to. Here, we find The National perfecting their sound, and the result is masterful.  Trouble WIll Find Me stands amongst the best works The National, perhaps the greatest band this decade, have ever done.

B007L3BMGA|2.0|The style of writing is not one that I normally would enjoy, however the author seems to have mastered getting into the mindset of the age group of those she is writing about. I am not sure I will be reading the rest of the series, thinking about it though.
B004N7WJF0|5.0|This DVD is awesome, even if you don't like rock 'n roll. You can buy it with closed eyes. It is really amazing.
B00C061I3K|5.0|In 2013, where most of the radio consists of music that took no effort to make, or that essentially reminds us that you don't really have to try anymore, it's amazing for an album like this to come out and show that pure effort can still make quality music, and to go back to a time where music like this was relatively common.<br /><br />Give Life Back to Music - A fairly straightforward song that does well as the intro for the album. My favorite song off of the album because the lyrics mean more to me than it does to most people, or so I figure.<br /><br />The Game of Love - The one track I honestly did not like.<br /><br />Giorgio by Moroder - A very interesting idea for a song, and well done. Giorgio talks for a couple of minutes in the beginning of the song while the music starts to build up, and when he stops, the music takes off.<br /><br />Within - A very sad route for a song to take. The first song to nearly make me cry that I have ever heard from daft punk.<br /><br />Instant Crush - Sad, but a little more upbeat than within, and the chorus is pure gold. The lyrics were well done and perfectly in tune with the music.<br /><br />Lose Yourself to Dance - Essentially what most people would call the 2nd single on the album. Pharrell does an amazing job with the lyrics, Nile Rodgers plays the guitar amazingly, and the robots vocals add into the music.<br /><br />Touch - This is by far the least Daft Punk song on the album, but that doesn't mean it's bad, in fact it's really good. But this sounds a lot more like a Bohemian Rhapsody than anything Daft Punk ever made.<br /><br />Get Lucky - If you're looking at this album, you've probably heard this song. Was the introductory song to the album's teasers, and a very fine one. The full version has a bit more progressions throughout than the radio edit.<br /><br />Beyond - Starts very differently than it ends, but the lyrics are solid.<br /><br />Motherboard - This was the hardest song for me to figure out what the direction was. It sounds like the song itself is confused.<br /><br />Fragments of Time - A very happy, upbeat song. Conveys a greater image than most of the other songs, as you will start to actually feel like you're driving at sunset towards somewhere else.<br /><br />Doin' it Right - A repetitive, but great song. Panda Bear does great on the vocals, and the music flows well. Little progression, but like most of Daft Punk's repetitive songs, it sounds great to listen to with or without progression.<br /><br />Contact - A mindblowing experience. By far the best way to end this album.
B009NY43NY|5.0|The only thing that could've made this story better would have been more pages! She did a wonderful job of tying things up better than I thought possible in 338 pages. I'll miss the series terribly, and would have loved to just luxuriate in the characters and their new beginnings a bit longer. But I guess I'd never have been ready to leave Bon Temps. I could finally see the threads she'd been weaving, that had quite frankly frustrated me, through the last two books come together and everything finally made sense. My only regret is the lack of resolution or happiness for Bill. Perhaps she's left a bit for this fall's After Dead?! I hope so!

B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Title: My Little Pony: Fall<br />Genre: Drama/Psychological/Action<br />Company: Shout! Factory<br />Format: Movie, 72 Minutes<br />Dates: 06 Aug 2013<br /><br />Synopsis: The feeling of happiness must zero out with the feeling of sorrow. Princess Celestia understood this, but she knew that she could not prevent the tides of despair from spreading upon the world eventually. Beyond Equestria lies a hell that should not be known to exist, but the curiousity of Equestria cannot be satiated. As Twilight Sparkle and her friends discover what lay beyond Equestria, the world will subsequently realize its true nature.<br /><br />The Highlights:<br />Characters: Down to earth and incredibly real.<br />Symbolism: Unbelievably unique and powerful.<br />Pacing: Doesn't skip a beat.<br />Animation: Flawless.<br />Ending: Cathartic and Bittersweet.<br /><br />Although some parts of the world are calm and soothing, there will never be world peace, and the struggles we must face are overiterated in comparision to the horrors others must fight from the day they are born. So who would have thought that a light franchise like My Little Pony would have the guts to bring this theme to life, and would do it in such a graceful way? I understand that a 10/10 review is something that should not be taken lightly, but this piece of artwork is something that should not be taken light, either. No matter what had come before this movie, the expectations of the general populace had been next to none. So that something like this would come from the My Little Pony Franchise is superlatively incredible. You may understand as you continue to read this review. I know I did.<br /><br />The first thing you should probably take from this movie is that the characters become more real and believable in this movie. Even characters like Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy seem to have some levity to the way they act and think, to the point in which the story presented becomes all the more tragic and heartaching. For example, there is no forced characterization in this movie, as, even when the characters are not shown as much, they show natural development through the natural order of life. I did not, for one second, question the logic or the writing, as the characters showed humanity, mind the ironic choice of diction, in every single action. They screwed up, quite often I may add, and they were not without flaws, tragic flaws that prevented them from reaching the simple goals that they felt they could reach. Twilight Sparkle particularly shines in her flaws, as she adds fuel to the fire of an already horrifying situation, even if her intention is the exact opposite. This is because she is strict and pedantic, and she fails to understand the mental limits that seperates her from the other characters. This form of characterization is something that has never been seen before in any My Little Pony work, and succeeds in every way possible.<br /><br />This isn't to say that MLP: Fall is a melodrama or pretentious garbage that only intends to milk tears (and money) out of the audience. Fall does indeed wrap itself around a mountain of symbolism, but the symbolism is creative and thoughtful enough to challenge masterpieces such as Mawaru Penguindrum and The Great Gatsby. Unlike Penguindrum, Fall presents its symbolism in relation to a concrete theme, and unconventionally uses it to successfully amplify its theme to a point in which it connects to the audience in a heartbreaking manner. Fall is a puzzle that has yet to be solved, but its theme is universal and timeless, and conveyed in a manner that, without the brilliant symbolism, likely wouldn't be nearly as effective otherwise.<br /><br />The thing about symbolism and realism is that it cannot be taken at face value unless the story is presented in a solid and steadbeat manner. Fortunately for MLP: Fall, the pacing is about as perfect as it can get, despite the short time-span of the movie. The events flow out like water but never overcomplicate, only adding more levity and style to the mystery that is Fall. I have never seen a single production pace a piece of writing so well with so many events yet such a small timespan. It oh-so-effectively goes out of its way to show the how the limit of mentality has no relevance to reality, and that life is cruel enough to break one within hours. The writers went way out of their way to make such a quality script within such little time. One wonders the kind of budget this movie had.<br /><br />The overwhelming popularity of the My Little Pony franchise obviously had some effect on the quality of the movie's animation. The budget challenges the rediculously high quality of Bakemonogatari, completely breaking the barrier of what can be done with animation. Never before has simple 2d animation been so flawless. One could watch the movie 500 times and never find a single blemish in the constant fluidity and beauty that is MLP: Fall's animation. The only complaint I have is that there are no flaws. It's no fun when I can't nitpick.<br /><br />With everything else above considered, the story wraps itself around to the universal reality that life is not perfect. To enjoy a perfect life, one must shadow oneself in ignorance and cowardly hide theirself from the rest of the world. Ignorance is bliss, and mentality is a gift. Once both are lost, only the power of one's psyche can help them through the cruel reality that is life. That is why the ending is so powerful and moving, as it conveys its theme in a way that has never been respected before. It does it... perfectly.<br /><br />Perfectly is an unrealistic word, but if it can apply anywhere, it's here. You will never have a writing experience more cathartic and moving than MLP: Fall, and if you can, then I would damn sure love to hear you tell the world about it, as there is likely no one on this planet who can deny the greatness that Hasbro has created out of such a simple yet beautiful franchise. My Little Pony: Fall, will forever be remembered as an unchallengable masterpiece.

B003Y059EK|2.0|This is the more obscure Disney take on a follow up to the esteemed Wizard of Oz where Dorothy returns to Oz. My kids sort of liked it but were bored a bit, since it is kinda slow and the storyline is a little heavier than the original. The story begins with Dorothy sent to an insane asylum to get electric shocks so that her Oz fantasies go away. Needless to say you have to address with your kids all these topics and there seem to be a lot of awful adults in this story. We didn't finish it because the girls 8,4 got scared by the demon volcano guy, yup there are some creepy characters in this one.

0345472322|3.0|Like others have noted, the book just goes on and on with individual examples. There are little/no research studies sited, which is a shame, because the opposite camp apparently does http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/2015/20130520/practice-makes-perfect-much.htm<br /><br />There are some experiments described on how different praise works. Well, in the fashion of the book, here is an example from my life - I was talking to someone and they told me that because her husband praised her for being smart, etc, it gave her the energy to do better at work. I mentioned the theories in this book. She said that apparently it did not apply to her...<br /><br />Anyway I appreciate the growth mindset, but the author's insistence that it is the golden grail is not factual. Like the study above claims, it DOES account for a PART of a person's success, but it isn't make or break. Mindset AND other factors are important. The author should not completely discount them.

159463176X|4.0|This novel opens with a parable told by a father to his son, about another father who is forced to give up his young son to a monster, a div.  When the father later confronts the div and discovers that his son has been well taken care of and is leading a happy life, the div asks the father to make a choice: take his son home or leave him to his happy life.  Realizing that to take his son would fill the void in his own heart but ruin his son's life, he leaves the son.  Recognizing the father's selflessness, the div rewards him by erasing the memory of his son.  Despite this \\"gift,\\" the father is left his a hole in his soul that is never filled.<br /><br />This opening parable is reflected in the rest of the interconnected stories in this novel, all of which involve, to some degree, characters presented with the same choice. Although the main narrative involves the bond between a brother and sister, this novel is actually much broader in scope than a story of siblings.  The common thread, in my mind, is the effect of breaking a bond between two family members or close friends.  When these bonds are broken, often voluntarily and for the good of one of the pair and the detriment of the other, the characters are forced to view the world in a new light.  As young Abdullah notes shortly before losing his sister, he \\"felt the true vastness of the desert, and the world, for the the first time.  How easily a person could lose his way in it.\\"<br /><br />Of course, every broken bond leaves a hole in the lives of the characters, ones they attempt to fill, often with other people.  As one mother explains, she needs her daughter to \\"fill these holes inside me.\\"  Some succeed in filling these voids, while others are left with gaping holes that will never be filled.<br /><br />Regardless of the overarching themes, this is an emotionally moving novel written by a master of crafting stories of relationships between people that we all can relate to.  Hosseini often comes close to treading into overwrought sentimentality that, in the hands of a lesser author, would turn me off.  Hosseini is saved by his remarkable ability to create characters and relationships that do not seem contrived.  I am not ashamed to admit that I teared up during parts of this novel, which, in my eyes, is a sign that it was written by a masterful storyteller.<br /><br />Hosseini is never restrained as he weaves several stories into a tapestry that is cohesive both in theme and in space.  Each story is somehow connected to the others, although the characters themselves are often unaware.  Like his other novels, this one focuses mainly on Afghanistan, but Hosseini spans the globe, placing parts of the story in California, Paris, and Greece.<br /><br />When The Kite Runner was published, not long after 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan, many Americans had little knowledge of the people that lived there.  Hosseini has excelled as introducing these people and their heartbreak to a general Western audience, humanizing the people that are eyewitnesses of the most recent war and the atrocious Taliban control that proceeded it.  Now, as our involvement in Afghanistan begins to wind down, this novel shows, in some ways, the effect of our involvement in the country.  This is not a novel about the war in Afghanistan. Many of the conflicts created in its stories, however, are in some way the result of the general upheaval caused by the many wars in that country.  If nothing else, Hosseini's novels reflect the fate of Afghans in the last century: being caught as a cultural crossroads that often results in a mashing of people, some of whom are flung to the far corners of the world.  One can only hope that the coming years bring a peace and prosperity to Afghanistan that allows the heart-wrenching dramas that populate Hosseini's novels to dissipate.ing into overwrought sentimentality that, in the hands of a lesser author, would turn me off.

B00CRW2066|5.0|The short review:  If you were a fan of The National's earlier albums but couldn't quite get into High Violet in the same way, you will be very pleased with this excellent album from The National.  The sound you love has returned.<br /><br />I've been a fan of The National since Alligator came out in 2006.  Both Alligator and Boxer are two of my favorite albums of all time.  I thoroughly enjoyed High Violet, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  I found it to be overly dark and hitting on only one note, with lead singer Matt Berninger's deep voice drowning in a sea of heavily distorted guitar that seemed to be missing all the hallmarks of an album by The National.<br /><br />All of The National's albums can easily be described as melancholy.  But with Alligator and Boxer, the sadness was packaged with a certain lightness and clarity.  The drumming in their earlier albums was not pounding, but rather inventive.  The heavy lyrics were counterbalanced with elegant tunes and music that at times could be defined as more orchestral than pure rock.  At their best, The National don't rely on pounding rock to get their point across, but instead craft a complex melody that draws you in.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that Trouble Will Find Me is a return to their old form.  Fans of Alligator and Boxer will find themselves on familiar ground.  Although some of the heaviness of High Violet returns, other songs, like the anthemic \\"Graceless\\" and the minimalist \\"Slipped\\" harken back to the earlier albums.  I found as the album progressed I was more drawn in.<br /><br />All of The National's albums take awhile to fully appreciate and I am skeptical of any early reviews.  Avoiding my own advice, however, I can say this is a beautiful album that brings me back to The National's early albums.  The National have matured and this is not an album that reflects the freedom of youth, instead focusing on a man's attempt to deal with growing older.  I am not sure that it will equal Alligator and Boxer in my mind, but perhaps that have to do more with my own changes than those of the band.  I have been listening to Vampire Weekend's new album nonstop since last Tuesday, but this album has replaced it.  I can't wait to get many, many more listens under my belt so I can truly get into it (and hope to update my review later).tor and Boxer in my mind, but perhaps that have to do more with my own changes than those of the band.

All the complaints about Tom Cruise being too small to be Reacher made me want to try the series one more time. The good news is that Killing Floor rocks. The bad news is that now I have all of these Reacher books to read...or is that good news too?

B0074YVW1G|4.0|This book was excellent in the sense that the writer utilized scientific research to substantiate her points.  At the beginning I had the feeling that I should have read this book as a teenager because while I started to appreciate me and who I was in my thirties it would have been tremendously helpful at that age.<br /><br />However, by the end of the book I somehow felt that the hypothesis was that it was better to be an introvert.  NOT TRUE - it is GREAT to be an introvert, we have our strengths that are sometimes overlooked in a world that values the characteristics exhibited by extroverts. But, we have our weaknesses and the world needs both introverts and extroverts.<br /><br />Overall though it is an excellent book that provided me with many ah ha moments and I recommend for both introverts - it allows you to understand why you are the way you are and why you do the things you do and extroverts - it gives you insight into the personality of a number of persons with whom you are acquainted.<br />[[ASIN:0307352153 Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking]]

B00CTSDDVO|3.0|SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT Please do not read this review unless you have seen the movie or do not plan to see the movie. I do not want to ruin anyone's movie going experience.<br /><br />I saw this movie in 3D and Imax I want to look at the movie with out the wrapping all the flashy stuff and exploding stuff and as many say the lens flair moments. This is a hard review for me to write I love Star Trek the TV shows and most of the movies but this second in the \\"reboots\\" just left me wondering.<br /><br />First the Imax was great the 3D I can not comment on due to a vision problem that does not allow me to see 3D. Now on to a breakdown of the movie.<br /><br />The movie opened with what I call the Raiders of the Lost Ark scene it was almost lifted right from raiders and at that time my worry set in was I going to see anything new or was what I call the George Lucas effect going to step in and sadly we got the Lucas effect.<br /><br />The reboot the new time line was to give ST it's own legs the freedom to go where no other ST has gone before. And where do we find the story we are dropped right in to The Wrath of Kahhn Yes JJ did a great job hiding at least from me the fact that Kahhn was back. I stayed away from reading about the movie so I may have been one of few that was like oh he is Kahnn . So now we are going to rehash the story that we already know about. But wait there is more let's throw in a dash of ST Undiscovered country in to the mix and let's play a game of trading places with Spock and Kirk this time let's kill Kirk but at the same time let's give away how he is saved half way into the movie. This movie held nothing new nothing to boldly go where no man had gone before. We took the opening from one movie and the base story from to others. I really expected more a lot more from this second movie.<br /><br />We have a completely new time line do you think we can get a completely new story???
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|My only complaint is that they have stretched the episodes to fit 16x9 monitors. it makes everything looked stretched and warped. Even if you select 4:3 display, it still looks terrible. I'd much rather see the original unstretched version in 4:3...I can stand the black bars on the side for the true original look and content.<br /><br />You will also find a few &#34;bonus&#34; episodes of &#34;Mrs. Columbo&#34;. The only bonus of this is the producers finding a place to palm off a few of these turkeys...truly horrific. It's not Kate Mulgrew's fault, its the writing/concept.

Again it is a very memorable story that I am sure is probably more based in reality than in fiction.  Hosseini has taken the delicate subject of under aged married girls and woman rights under Islamic rule and allow us a sneak peek into the lives  of two characters brought together by life's circumstances who must learn to depend on each other in order to survive. It is a human story of fear, devotion, trust, love, survival and human sacrifice.<br />Anyone who enjoyed the Kite Runner will be equally entertained by this follow up which will resonate with the human spirit.
B00947N6UG|5.0|My children absolutely love this movie. It quickly became our new go-to when the three of them cannot agree on the movie. It is a little dark and can be a bit scary, I suppose. My own kids (ages 4, 3, and 2) didn't have any issues with it, though.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|first off... who doesnt love samurai. and B.. who doesnt love zombies. put the two together and you have magic, which is what this game is. it also makes you work to level up which is a nice change of pace. love it!!!
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|I did not have high hopes for this movie. That being said, I let house guests rent it on demand and enjoyed it so much, I bought it off amazon before the credits were rolling.
B0037472NY|4.0|This third book has definitely been the best one so far in the series. Plenty of suspense that will keep the pages turning! Lots of twists that keeps one guessing!
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Well, I can understand why some ppl hate this record. It doesn't appeal to the hipster, tweens and alt-dads like bumford & sons or katy perry. But to those who truly love psychedelic music, this album is a must-have. Dummy was okay, and there were great songs off that record. But the Thrid is wayy more superior in terms of composition and sonic characteristic. As of 2013, I haven't heard anything else quite like the Third. Buy this, and give it some time, it's rewarding.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|All you have to say is &#34;Shinedown&#34; and I'm in!  This CD has not left my car but only to be stored in my computer at work so I can listen there as well.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is an amazing game it takes a while to download but it is worth it.This game is super addictive!!!!
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|I am dissapointed that the movie is in lettrrbox widescreen instead of anamorphi widescreen. Why can't it be done right. Thanks that Amazon Prime has it streaming in real HD.Widescreen. How about a Blue Ray version? Great historical movie.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Love Columbo!!  Loving having the complete series. This is not an action packed show.  This is the thinking man's show.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|This is a great way to learn how to play the piano, by using a game to teach you how to play.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I think that it sucked that you cant stay in the game without dying. so I just went and bought the original.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a great show. The plot is great and I love how she is handling herself and her life after what her husband did.

1475143389|5.0|I am a 37-years old and I have, for the last 15 years, wanted to find the motivation to work out consistently. However, with lack of knowledge and real motivation I have failed many times over. I stumbled upon this simple little book online, then bought the print copy. For someone like me who needed a simple and easy approach, good basic knowledge and some belief in that results will actually show (my number one doubt), this book was perfect for me. I would not have picked up a 1000-page book by Arnold or some bodybuilding champion, I would not have wanted to read through research. I wanted someone I could trust, an easy program that works. Mike not only delivers with his book, he has a great website and he answers your additional questions per email. And most of all I can testify that the program really works! I am seeing exactly the results I was hoping for. I am actually loving going to the gym now, just like he promises.. For someone in my situation, the book has been life-changing. I cannot imagine going back to not working out consistently ever again. Thanks to Mike.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book, not sure what to expect. I admit I laughed, cried and thought WHAT&#34;???? A whole lot. However the child molestation hit home for me, and makes me really sad. I will continue with the series.
1476719071|5.0|\\"When you're around, I don't need booze or money or the fighting or the one-night stands ... all I need is you. You're all I think about. You're all I dream about. You're all I want.\\"<br /><br />There are thousands of reviews of this series already, so why must I post another one?  Well, I do feel the need to say something in tribute of the one and only Travis `Mad Dog' Maddox!<br /><br />But first, I did something different - I read both books together concurrently and I really enjoyed it.  Abby's POV (book 1) serves as the backbone of the series and then Travis' POV (book 2) adds to it and it's such a treat to read his thoughts and feeling - to get even closer to the enigma that is Travis Maddox.<br />Whether you are planning to re-read or if you have not read series yet, I highly recommend you read them together in tandem. The experience was epic!  Here is the order I recommend:<br /><br />Book 1 - Chapter 1<br />Book 2 - Prologue, Chapter 1 & 2<br />Book 1 - Chapter 2<br />Book 2 - Chapter 3, 4, 5 & 6<br />Book 1 - Chapter 3 & 4<br />Book 2 - Chapter 7, 8, 9 & 10<br />Book 1 - Chapter 5<br />Book 2 - Chapter 11<br />Book 1 - Chapter 6<br />Book 2 - Chapter 12<br />Book 1 - Chapter 7<br />Book 2 - Chapter 13<br />Book 1 - Chapter 8<br />Book 2 - Chapter 14<br />Book 1 - Chapter 9<br />Book 2 - Chapter 15 & 16<br />Book 1 - Chapter 10<br />Book 2 - Chapter 17<br />Book 1 - Chapter 11 & 12<br />Book 2 - Chapter 18<br />Book 1 - Chapter 13 & 14<br />Book 2 - Chapter 19<br />Book 1 - Chapter 15 & 16<br />Book 2 - Chapter 20, 21 & 22<br />Book 1 - Chapter 17<br />Book 2 - Chapter 23<br />Book 1 - Chapter 18<br />Book 2 - Chapter 24<br />Book 1 - Chapter 19 & 20<br />Book 2 - Chapter 25<br />Book 1 - Chapter 21 & 22<br />Book 2 - Chapter 26 & 27<br />Book 1 - Epilogue<br />Book 2 - Epilogue (be sure to save for last!)<br /><br />The story opens up with Travis and Abby both attending Eastern University.  She is a freshman, but Travis has a few years of College under his belt.  Abby's best friend, America is dating Travis' cousin/roommate, Shepley.  Their first meeting takes place at one of Travis' underground fights hosted by the \\"Circle\\".  He spots her in the crowd and is instantly smitten and so their whirlwind romance begins.  Nothing short of a roller-coaster with Abby's secrets and Travis' past.  They are perfect together, yet their story will be filled with many ups and downs:<br />\\"Now that it's over, I wish I could have all the bad stuff back... just so I could have the good.\\"<br /><br />Hero: Travis Maddox aka `Mad Dog/21~ years/College student-underground fighter/dark hair/brown eyes/tattoos<br />Heroine: Abigal Abernathy aka Abby aka Pigeon/(18) 19 years/College student/caramel hair/grey eyes<br /><br />Travis `Mad Dog' Maddox is larger-than-life.  He is everything I could ask for in a hero and so much more.  Until he met Abby he was an enigmatic, hard, cocky, short-tempered and unattainable man-whore.  It is revealed early on that he lost his mother at age three and was left to be raised by his oldest brother while his father recovered from the loss of his wife.  His mother had this advice for him on her death bed:<br />\\"One of these days you're going to fall in love, son. Don't settle for just anyone. Choose the girl that doesn't come easy, the one you have to fight for...\\"<br /><br />He grew up not letting anyone in.  He has love for his five brothers and his father plus his cousin, but no woman has ever held his attention until Abby.<br />\\"I decided a long time ago I would feed on the vultures until a dove came along. A pigeon. The kind of soul that didn't impede on anyone; just walked around worrying about its own business, trying to get through life without pulling everyone else down with its own needs and selfish habits. Brave. A communicator. Intelligent. Beautiful. Soft-spoken. A creature that mates for life. Unattainable until she has a reason to trust you.\\"<br /><br />Abby Abernathy has a past and secrets.  Attending Eastern University is a new beginning for her.  She has it all planned out from staying focused and keeping her distance to the type of man she wants to date.  Travis does not fit the bill:<br />\\"He was the worst kind of confident. Not only was he shamelessly aware of his appeal, he was so used to women throwing themselves at him that he regarded my cool demeanor as refreshing instead of an insult.\\"<br /><br />Instead she agrees to be his friend:<br />\\"His eyes widened and he quivered with howling laughter. \\"Oh my God! You're killing me! That's it. We have to be friends. I won't take no for an answer.\\"<br /><br />But all too soon they spend all their time fighting their attraction to each other.  Abby manages to be annoying about it while Travis is intense, adorable, possessive and insecure all at once.  Because Abby is what Travis wants you'll find yourself rooting for him and for them and for their happily-ever-after.<br />\\"You like Pigeon,\\" he said defensively. \\"It's a dove, an attractive girl, a winning card in poker, take your pick. You're my Pigeon.\\"<br /><br />Jamie McGuire is an excellent storyteller!  Travis Maddox is an unforgettable hero!  The Beautiful series is an epic must-read!<br /><br />\\"I didn't know I was lost until you found me. I didn't know what alone was until the first night I spent without you in my bed.

B00005JKDR|5.0|I've been meaning to order this classic for a while and I loved it. Ran smoothly... just as I recalled. &#60;3
B0097K21YW|4.0|Very fun to play the role of the destroyer. Challenging levels that will keep you coming back. And how can you possibly stay away from such monstrously fun destruction.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|After  taking a look at this movie with its powerful platform, I think that even I, came away splattered with Jesus's blood, on me. Very unique take on the crucifixion of Christ, it is inconceivably bloody, yet it gets its message across the board admirably  to every individual, without restraint. It is an astounding movie well worth viewing.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Since this app was updated I haven't been able to look a radar maps.  Old app was much more user friendly. Uninstalled.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I just recently got a chance to see To see film makers Quentin Tarantinos oscar nominated and eventual best screen play winner and best supporting actor winner ( Christoph Waltz ) latest offering feature Django Unchain. As a black male I stayed away from this movie when it hit theaters because of the controverses that surrounded it, and the heavy use of the (N word) the last place I want to be was in a theater with other people of other races and backgrounds and hearing that particular penetrating word. I grew up in California,  in my community I wherely heard it. And usually if I did hear it, it didnt have the racial edge to it like it does in the movie. Like I said early I finally saw the movie, I rented it from red box, and from were Im observing things the movie is indeed a master piece of spectaculer cinema all my self conscious fears lifted off me once I found out how truly awesome this movie is and all the rewards and accolades it has recieved is well deserved.  I'm really considering purchasing this movie i've already told people about it and my dad who is a old western buff how much he has to see this one. I sincerely hoped my review helped. If you have'nt gotten the chance  to see it, please go out and rent or buy this movie, it expeditiously out does itself, Quentin Tarantino is the MAN! P.S in the scene were actor Leonardo DiCaprio hand is blooded thats real blood he actually injured himself on set and still stayed in charactor the whole time how powerful is that!
B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|I've been listening to Daft Punk since the 90s and have enjoyed many of the funky, hypnotic, techno-rock tracks that they've produced over the years. After the masterpiece that they created for the Tron soundtrack I was pretty pumped to preview the songs from this album. All I have to say is WOW, not a fan.<br /><br />It's good for artists to branch out and try new things IMO, but there is always going to be a risk that long-time fans won't enjoy the direction they take. I'm not a disco or R&B fan, and that is the direction they took.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Finally the end, but not the ending I had wanted at all. I'm disappointed with it, but I understand. This was OK it really lacked the vigor and enthusiasm as the first 4 books, but like all those who are addicted to books, we take what we can get, even if it is stretched out.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book so much! Her characters are so real, and the main female character was a diabolical mess!
B00000J7SS|4.0|Do not get this as your first Miles Davis album (\\"Kind of Blue\\" or \\"Steamin'\\" are much better choices for that.)  It's reputation as innovative and brilliant are well deserved, but it's also a very difficult and challenging album throughout.<br /><br />Duke Ellington called Miles Davis \\"The Picasso of Jazz.\\"  This album is evidence that the Duke was right.  It's is a wonderfully noisy jazz-rock fusion that bristles with energy.  It's not easily accessible, but it is very good.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|It's an amazing story everyone should read. I have read It many times and have loved it every time. -
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The Fifty shades books are great.... It's more then just sex but a great love story. I highly recommend you read all three.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled is completely unique, delightful romp. It is told from Drew's point of view, but he also shares hilariously unfiltered dialogues with the readers. So it is like you are listening to Drew tell you his story with his little snarky comments and observations thrown in. He foreshadows events for us and makes us pay attention to important details. I just loved Drew from the first page. We meet him as a disheveled big mess, acting uncharacteristically, and suffering from the \\"flu\\"(denial speak for a broken heart). Then he begins to tell us the story about him and Kate.<br /><br />\\"It finally happened.\\"<br />\\"What happened?\\"<br />\\"What you've been wishing on me all these years...\\"<br />\\"I fell in love.\\"<br /><br />Drew is normally a cocky, handsome, in control Golden Boy in business and with the ladies. Women fall at his feet, he takes what he wants and does not get involved or do repeats. But from the minute he sees Kate, she is different. She turns his head, turns him on, and turns him down. She makes an impression on him, but soon they meet again...at his office where she is now currently employed. Kate is no pushover. She is tough in business, smart, funny, sassy, and unavailable.<br /><br />(Quote)And she works here. In my office, where I have sworn to never...ever...screw around...and two thoughts enter my head simultaneously. The first is: God hates me. The second is: I have been a naughty, naughty boy for most of my life, and this is my payback. And you know what they say about payback, right? Yep, she's one hairy b***h.<br /><br />(Quote)She's different. She's like a Rubik's Cube. So frustrating at times that you want to toss it out the goddamn window. But you don't. You can't. You're compelled to keep playing with it til you figure it out.<br /><br />All of their interactions seem to be battles. Battles for attention, for attraction, for work projects, for love and for forgiveness. There is a very thin line between love and hate and they constantly ride that line. They are both stubborn, strong willed, but also have fear and insecurities. Together they are literally combustible personally, professionally, and sexually. Their reactions to one another are always extreme. Their fights are rude, hilarious, and quite devilish. They get under each other's skin and do not hold back.<br /><br />(Quote)Do you think she enjoys the verbal foreplay as much as I do? She's got to, She's so good at it.<br /><br />And arguing just makes them hot and bothered. The flip flop back and forth between enemies, friends, and lovers. But when they get it together and are on the same page, they are hot, sexy, sweet, and perfectly suited to one another. I loved seeing the more vulnerable Drew as he finally understands what it is like to find the \\"one\\" that makes him want to have a real relationship. But they are so volatile that they are bound to have issues and Drew finds himself in the biggest battle of his life to win her heart...and he is not afraid to play dirty and bring out the big guns. And Kate really makes him work for it. And the things he comes up with are priceless.<br /><br />\\"But you're not, Kate. You're not like anyone I've ever know. I want to be with you...really be with you. Only you. And I know I sound like a freaking Hallmark card, but it's true. I've never wanted all the things I want to have when I'm with you.\\"<br /><br />The main characters were well developed and you could not help but like them even if they were acting up or making you crazy. The supporting characters were equally entertaining and added a great background dynamic. The whole book is not funny, there are some sad, heartbreaking and emotional moments, But the frantic flow and intermittent witty comments keep you engaged throughout.<br /><br />This book was hilarious, entertaining, romantic, heartbreaking, and completely enjoyable. Drew had me laughing out loud! I devoured it in one sitting and could not put it down. I love Emma Chase's writing style andDrew's private conversations with us. I am definitely looking forward to more from this author.<br /><br />Thanks to Emma Chase for providing me with a review copy in exchange for an honest review.
B005K17RU0|3.0|easy to access and simple to switch from location to location as you travel. details could be better but for free quick app it works just fine
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|It was different than I expected but I still enjoyed Kids would like it.I would not consider buying this movie..
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love it,simular to hill racing only a little better,more stages to complete<br />graphics good and works great on the kindle fire hd found no problems with it<br />at all. I recommend this,check it out!!!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I was disappointed.  Enough said.After all the hype I expected more coverage of Lincoln&#34;s life with his wife. It was alright.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Perfect for Sun worshipers like me,gives all details on weather especially<br />heat index on how much you want to burn!!!I definitely recommend if you even<br />like to check out weather elsewhere,time to go out and B U R N!!! Check it out
B002GYS1FO|4.0|I really like the first half of the CD, but somewhere near the middle it just seemed to wander off course.  To put it lightly it seemed like filler.  It's a shame too because the first half was quirky in a good way, it compelled you to listen to it, near the end I just wanted to turn it off.
0143116371|5.0|Such a wonderful book full of delightful images. Scott Schuman is truly an artist and has managed to capture style on the streets impressively. A great gift idea!
B009JZVT70|5.0|Season two is the best yet. The actors are amazing especially Rumpelstiltskin, It's like every episode is a season finally....
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I did NOT expect to like it as much as I did, seriously. I caught the first few on Netflix and became so engrossed in it that I ran to Amazon and bought the first season. Characters are amazing (and oh my GOSH Alex has had some of the most intense and enthralling character development I've seen in television in a long time. AND she's kick ass.) and the chemistry they all have with each other is off the charts.<br /><br />The untouchable heroine I think is the only thing that was predictable, though I was super happy with the obstacles she had to overcome to be as bad ass as she is.<br /><br />Loved it, will definately be watching the seasons to come. :)
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|This app provides me the ability to network with individuals and important business that could be out essence. Very helpful and resourceful
B00000IQW5|5.0|Funny comes to mind but it goes to your heart as well.  I felt as if I was there with them.  They ( the actors) were a team.<br />Fighting fires is a very dangerous career, so to see the humor and companionship brought out ( even if it's a movie ) the reality of these young men and women.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is quite a stress-reliever. Anytime I have a bad moment I'm able to pay this game a calm down. I'm always able to laugh and smile while playing this game. Best choice I could have made for entertainment and I would recommend everyone to purchase this app
B004J4WNL2|4.0|In the autumn of my own life, and an introvert, I found the book extremely helpful in understanding myself, and can only wish it had been written and I had read it in my late college or graduate school years.  It clearly focused what I could only &#34;see in a glass darkly&#34; over the years. First, we live in a world that values extroverts over introverts.  Susan Cain is an introvert who started competing in a world of highly intelligent extroverts, recognized that and the unnecessary discomfort it created in her, and set about shifting her career path to one more suited to her introverted comfort level.<br />In the process she studied introversion, it's sources, it's strength and weaknesses, and how to compete and be valued while meeting the needs of the introvert.<br />For me it totally revised my understanding of introversion- removed negative biases- and helped me see repeated situations as typical for introverts.  If you have ever sat through a meeting and found yourself drowned out by the brazen certainly of extroverts when you were quite sure you were the one who understood the problem best, this book may be a very worthwhile read.<br />It is also a worthwhile read for managers who want to learn how best to nurture introverts, though in general extreme extroverts will fine it far more than they want to know.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|I find Clint Eastwood and his characters to be too negative.  If I want grumpy old men, I'll watch Grumpy Old Men.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I thought this book was excellent and compelling as a fan of the Percy Jackson this book was well written.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series. Love the time period and all the play amongst the characters. I have all the seasons on DVD. Looking forward the ( I hope ) to the never ending saga of Downton Abbey!!!!! Season 4---can't wait!!
B00C9QQBA6|3.0|She just &#34;loves him&#34;? Really? Weak development of characters, rushed story, very little depth to the &#34;short story&#34;. If you just take the main points and don't think about anything while reading it is not a terrible story, there's just so much more that could have been done with this and there is much better, for free, on my kindle to read. Will not be buying the series.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I'm a student and I usually have to get up fairly early and was in need of a good alarm, at first I was not a 100% sure if it would be loud enough to wake me up, but it did and very quickly, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is a heavy sleeper or is in need of a good alarm! (=
B00000I41G|5.0|I don't claim to be an audiophile, but my copy of the 1999 Rudy Van Gelder Edition of this CD sounds mighty fine to me. I'm also not a jazz purist or someone with encyclopediac knowledge of jazz, but I like jazz guitar and I love the sound of this album. I certainly think it is deserving of all the accolades and praise that it has received. If you like jazz guitar, or any type of talented guitar playing, Kenny Burrell will impress you to no end. Smooth style, not flashy, but very, very enjoyable.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|VERY FUN FOR ALL THE KIDS AND ME TOO!! GLAD WE GOT THIS APP FOR THE KINDLE FIRE HD. DID I SAY IT WAS FUN..
B008ROGQAE|5.0|This is one of those movies I watched as kid and, being mesmorized by Yul Brynner's performance without knowing it, thought was a real time and place for a while. I think it gave me nightmares! But it was a movie I never quite forgot and to see it again now, enjoying Mr. Brynner's steely eyes and nonplussed expression, I understand why I felt the way I did at 9 yrs old, but now thoroughly enjoy every aspect of this far-reaching, \\"new century western\\", and recommend it to anyone old enough to appreciate the great delights of this classic film.
0446613444|3.0|I started out with \\"The Black Echo\\" and really liked the book. \\"Bloodwork\\" was next, loved that book.<br />This one is a good read, and gets more interesting toward the end, but I just couldn't get in to it. Don't really know what the problem was, other than the storyline didn't interest me much. It just seemed to be all over the place, with Harry gathering info from everywhere, but logically it shouldn't have connected enough to solve the crime.  I tended to put the book down, on a regular basis, and listen to an audio book, in fact I went through 2 audios, before finishing this novel.<br />I won't let that discourage me though, and will go forward with the series.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling has hit the music scene with an incredible, amazing force.<br />And with good reason...she is talented, she is unique, she is wonderful and she is fun to watch!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|A great way to have good clean fun for everyone.  Cost no money to play and you can make new friends from all over the world.

B00005JLEU|5.0|This is probably my most favorite Miyazaki movie and one of my top animated movies of all time.  Showed it at a neighborhood movie party and it was a _big_ hit.  Fabulous story that entrances just about everyone.
B00BY8DC2A|4.0|The Brand New Heavies return with an album full of the usual fusion of jazz, funk, soul, r'n'b and pop. Great melodies and catchy tunes mixed in with some brilliant instrumental tracks.<br /><br />New vocalist Dawn Joseph is a welcome addition and provides some excellent input, and ofcourse N'dea Davenport is back to bring some \\"Sunlight\\" to proceedings with the awesome first single that is set to be my summer anthem.<br /><br />All of this takes you back to their biggest and brightest moments on their first three albums. If you loved Brother Sister and Shelter then this will definitely get your juices flowing!!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I really love being able to select the various sounds available with the app. There have been many new sounds to download as well as the ones included. This is a great app!
B001QB9H10|4.0|I really get a kick out of Statham...he is just pure fun BANG, BANG, BOOM, BOOM<br />moves right along...when I watch these kind of movies I have gotten to where I count the minutes they are running, chasing, shooting, blasting and then the 10 or 15-30 minutes of ACTUAL PLOT.  It is like exercising without any sweat!<br /><br />Lots of fun, &#34;PG-13&#34;.  Not &#34;great&#34; drama.  The second one with the child abduction actually has an interesting plot...the same story with Denzel Washington in the Man on Fire &#34;R&#34;.  Washington's movie was a better plot, but Statham is not as painfully graphic.  I don't need to see so much blood and gore like is in the Washington movies (Bone Collector).  Statham is like being on a roller coaster...Washington is like...do you want to throw up.  I have quit watching TV shows that are too graphic also...such as Criminal minds...an instruction book for desensitizing humans to be INHUMAN and how to HURT OTHER PEOPLE in ways no sane person would ever have bothered to think about.  In adventure movies each one trying to outdo the other.  Shakespeare still takes the &#34;cake&#34; with Titus Andronicus...<br /><br />Humans have loved gore since the Roman Circus/Colosseum...there are still cock, dog and bull fights.  People are sooner or later going to change the laws so boxing is not the only show that is bloody enough...oh, the Hunger Games!  Does art follow reality or does reality follow art?
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton has a great talent for blending her novels themes across time and 'The Secret Keeper' is no exception as the story takes us from the present day, back to the protagonists childhood in the sixties and further back to the years of her mother's youth.<br /><br />As a teenager in the sixties Laurel Nicholson witnessed a terrifying scene while spending some time alone with her dreams in the tree house at Greenacres Farm where she has spent a happy childhood, until that moment. The secret stays with her until the present day when facing her Mother's forthcoming ninetieth birthday celebrations she finds herself overwhelmed by her old memories of that day. She decides it is time to find out the truth before it is too late as her mother Dorothy is failing fast; with the help of a few clues she manages to obtain from her Laurel's research begins. As a reader we are able to follow this not just in the present day but with the characters concerned as they lived through the events, helping our understanding of all they were experiencing in real time. The characters are all very complex and no one is as they first seem, but it is these characters their relationships and the secrets that are revealed that will keep you reading.<br /><br />I will say no more but recommend this captivating tale of mysteries secrets and enduring love, especially to those of you that like a really long novel to curl up with.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|...if you liked those you will probably like Hobbit and needing to buy the next two to finish this Triligy.  Like reading the books...adult fairy tales.
B000002J2F|4.0|For fans of Genesis's prog rock era, this is probably the last stop before they check out.  The reason is the \\"suite\\" that lies interspersed throughout the album.  Oddly, though parts of the suite (particularly \\"Duke's Travels\\" and \\"Duke's End\\") feature lengthy instrumental sections that get the proggies excited, some of it is actually more reminiscent of the more pop-oriented work that began to vault them into the hit charts around this time.  OK, so \\"Turn It On Again\\" is in 13, but its motoric beat and catchy riff are a sign of things to come.<br /><br />Outside the suite, the music is of more mixed quality.  After taking a junior partner role to Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford on earlier albums, here he is more of an equal contributor, and his tunes are actually quite good - particularly \\"Misunderstanding\\".  Banks and Rutherford seem like they are still stuck in And Then There Were Three land. Banks's tunes (\\"Heathaze\\", \\"Cul de Sac\\") are solid, but Rutherford's (\\"Alone Toniiiiiiight\\" and \\"Man of Our Tiiiiiiiiimes\\") are tedious and annoying.<br /><br />Overall, worth hearing for the suite and a few of the other tunes.
0790729601|4.0|It's running hiding good guys getting the bad guys...and finding out who all is not what they claim to be.
B000002J2D|3.0|This album is the plain stepchild of Genesis's catalogue.  It's not as good as the earlier prog rock albums, nor as enjoyable as the more pop-oriented LPs of the early 80s.  Little of the music here is offensively bad, but a lot of it is boring.  Burying it all are way too many keyboards!  A few songs deserve honorable mention: \\"Undertow\\", \\"Burning Rope\\", \\"The Lady Lies\\".  A few of the others - \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\", \\"Many too Many\\", \\"Deep in the Motherlode\\", \\"Say It's Alright Joe\\" - are decent. The rest tend to run together in a bland mishmash.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It does what it says it will do in a clean and functional design. I know some have mentioned the lack of a couple features. I like it in it's current form, but some of the suggestions mentioned hold merit and I can see how they could add to it. Imho
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the game, it's perfect for people who've played the original and people who like fast-paced games. My only issue with it is that once I exit the game and charge my Kindle, I can't get back in the app.
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|I love Daft Punk. I've been a fan since the late '90's.. They've always created free flowing cutting edge edm.. I even like old school Disco with that old fashioned signature Chic sound.. THIS album, however, not their best. \\"Get Lucky\\" was probably the only track worth listening to. I do like that Nile Rodgers (co/creator of Chic), was featured on the song and it was Chic- lite with \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\" thrown in at the end. I guess that's why I'm a little more forgiving than I am with most of the other tracks,'cause the rest of this set is somewhat disappointing.. I guess there are certain songs that were so mellow that you could..relax and smoke weed with them in the background, ala Pink Floyd, but others sounded like mid 70's album rock and others, like Giorgio by Moroder, wtf?? I like Giorgio as a producer, but not talking on a music track..No Grammy for spoken word, here.... This isn't music exploration, it's just a ho hum '70's homage project.. It could have been great, but I wasn't really feeling it. Hopefully, they'll get back to better sounding electronic music in the future.
B0042ESTQW|5.0|For starters I should mention I use my Edge 810 for more than just cycling as I often rely upon its navigational abilities whilst walking in foreign cities; and in London, this often involves a good drenching. In hand, this cover adds a reassuring tactile feel to my slippery 810 and protects its fragile electronics against a drop on unforgiving pavements. It's easy to apply and fits perfectly.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This was a very good and entertaining movie.  My wife and I enjoyed it since it was a family friendly film.  It was a good story with an interesting plot twist at the end.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I got this as the F.A.O.T.D. and was enjoying it.  Then an update came out and locked down 6 of 12 levels and said I had to pay to unlock!!! 3 stars for a fun game. -2 stars for not having full access for a paid app. Buyer beware!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|90210 is what it is, better than the new 90210.  the product came to me as advertised, no complications at all
1419705849|5.0|Young guys can not put the book down. Really love it. It is related to school kids and their lives.
B004TI1WME|4.0|Several functions W/ landscape or portrait mode. Color themes simple but nice change<br />very handy when at store or online shopping
630587493X|5.0|This is one of my mother's favorite movies of all time and she was looking for it for the longest. Her birthday was coming up and I decided to take a chance and hunt for it on Amazon. I will admit that I procrastinated in ordering the movie so it didn't get to her in time for her birthday; that was my fault. However, shipping was quick and it arrived the day after her birthday. The product was exactly as advertised; new, never been opened. The case, itself was starting to cave in on the sides and so we opened it to make sure that nothing was wrong; probably just something that happens to plastic cases like that over time: the DVD was flawless!
B004U52VPS|5.0|Great price for a great product.  Its kinda cheesy, but the product is high quality!  The kids love this thing and its cheaper than sold at Target!
0743289692|5.0|I would absolutely recommend this book. It is both inspiring and heartbreaking.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali is my idol and someone I havee tremendous respect for, all because of this book.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|I felt like the season should've resolved more issues.  Without giving the story line away, there were to many things dragged out to create a third season.  The cinematography is excellent.  The costumes are brilliant but the story line was a little long and disjointed.  I absolutely loved the first season and will watch the third but won't need to see it the day it comes out.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|My sister suggested I read this book and I was reluctant since I am a 24/7 caregiver for my 87 year old mother.  Books should take you out of your everyday life.  I was so wrong, this book made me fall in love with both the main characters,  laugh, cry and grieve when there was no more to read.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I have looked everywhere for these Maglite D-Cell wall clamps to put in our new RV so we could mount our flashlight by the door!  Love that I was able to get them here and the price was not bad either!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Fun game makes you concentrate.  Several variations to work with depending on your skill level. Makes you want to play again to improve you time. Very challenging.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|I don't recall why I bought this book, or why it took so long before I finally picked it up to read it. But I am really glad I did. And I think everyone else who tries it will enjoy it as much as I did.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A great time consuming game. If you were a fan of Excite bike from the 80's you will love this game.T only game I play.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|The game is good but I think some of the levels are to hard .but I play the game a lot.and the sand boxes shouldn't be unlocked through levels.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|My husband and I enjoy asking each other what the other added to our park since it is yet another fun thing we can do together. Best of all it`s free. So you get a bit more than ya pay for. ;)
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Very enjoyable read as this was my first Jack Teacher novel. It was a little boring in parts and I did enjoy the first half better than the last half.  Perhaps I was tainted a little knowing Tom Cruise played  Reacher because Mr. Cruise is no Jack Reacher, nevertheless I'll read the next one \\"Die Trying\\"
1600597963|5.0|This book is one of the best I've bought. It's a quality, sturdy book with color pictures on every page. The techniques are explained very well and the design ideas it has in it are limited only by how fast you can finish a project. There are some books I buy that I regret the content of or pictures or price.  Not this one! I had bookmarked so many pages to go back to for a technique or a design idea that I stopped - I was bookmarking every other page!. No regrets on this purchase. Your bead embroidery study shelf needs this!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really think it was a good game, I'm a huge fan of puzzle games and this was worth the 2.00. Only complaint is it was too short. Can't wait for the next one they need to hurry up with it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|All the characters you missed out on from book 4 continue their journeys. It is addictive and maddening at the same time.<br />Get the E-book for kindle so you can read it on your phone or tablet, you will not want to put this one down.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|thank you for your prompt handling of this situation.  It was much appreciated. You helped my customer so very much.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 7 year old grandson loves it.  It is great for hand/eye coordination and it is a fun game to play.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Epic in scope and intimate in emotion.  Characters that have been with me for 20 years finally reach the Last Battle. I had my doubts as to how any ending could be the &#34;right&#34; ending, but Sanderson manages to conclude the series with grace and skill.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|We bought this because we had seen the movie before on t.v.  We wanted our own copy of it.  I loved how they used the names of the songs to name the characters in the movie.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app is very handy for use in doubling a recipe . Its also good for sewing patterns . I'm happy to get this app on free app day.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Love this movie! We saw it in the theater and liked it so much we had to have it. We watch it whenever we are in the mood for action and fun!
0312427999|5.0|This is no conspiracy story-telling, but straight up facts. Thanks to Naomi Klein for the most insightful book I, or you, will ever come across. Once read, pass it on to whomever you know. And if you're a parent or a professor, teach it to your kids & students.<br /><br />I would love to hear Naomi's opinion on the so called 'Arab Spring', the horrible conflict in Syria and the recent economic crisis in Cyprus (after such beautiful knowledge, the reader will pretty much understand the reasons behind the situations noted above, and will also be able to make a close prediction on their outcomes)<br /><br />Just a quick note: ditch the mass media, because you are way off track!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|After 8 seasons this show is very good. I often find myself laughing at the online zingers the characters throw at each other and I love the classic rock used as background music. The plot is interesting and the characters of Sam and Dean work well together.
B008JFUMDS|4.0|It is very important to realize that this movie must not be spoiled. I will not be discussing anything not shown in the trailers, and I ask you not to go looking for such secrets online, but only by watching it yourself. This movie is designed to entertain, and to a degree it does just that.<br /><br />I haven't seen many of Leterrier's films, but I enjoyed this about as much as The Incredible Hulk, but more than Clash of the Titans. There were still disappointments. Magic movies have been a great interest of mine, and from the trailer I had to wonder, does Michael Caine + woman in a tank = The Prestige? Truthfully, the similarities stopped there, including magic's screentime.<br /><br />Despite magic taking up most of the trailers, it was too scarce in the film itself. I wanted more magic. I know that doing so would take screen time from Ruffalo, but he wasn't the best of the bunch. In fact, they were Freeman, Caine, and Laurent, respectively.<br /><br />The screenwriting didn't allow for many to develop character well. The Four Horsemen were usually smooth-talking brick walls. And was that Dave Franco I saw? He had no screentime! (except for brief fancy dodging falling fighting)<br /><br />These character holes would be acceptable if the movie were a large show. But as mentioned before, magic only came in smaller pieces, when at all. Some were amazing, some were old already, and some were hilarious.<br /><br />It seems like I didn't appreciate the movie much, but I could only talk about what I didn't like. The rest, the secrets, I loved but can't talk about. Suffice it to say that many surprises are in store, and they're worth watching the movie for. That said, it's best to go in without guessing and predicting, because seeing the many reveals is where most of the entertainment lies. Don't spoil it for yourself.<br /><br />This is a film some would be happier seeing in theatres, but if you don't think you'd spend ticket money for this, you'd probably regret it, so wait for dvd.<br /><br />As a warning, there is a suggestive/inappropriate scene near the beginning that ends up going nowhere, but children's eyes should be turned aside. Also, there's a moment in a mardi gras parade that needs to be avoided, and minor language throughout. I'd recommend this movie for 17+, not only for these, but for the understanding of the secret material I can't bring up.wait for dvd.<br /><br />As a warning, there is a suggestive/inappropriate scene near the beginning that ends up going nowhere, but children's eyes should be turned aside.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really enjoy the puzzles but did have a little trouble with some of the zoom in scenes where it seems you have to zoom in twice to actually move the objects to complete the puzzle but otherwise a lot of fun a little challenging. Can't wait for new game or continuation of the room game
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I am a huge Jodi Picoult fan and this book was no different where I couldn't put it down and couldn't get enough.<br /><br />Erin F

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game for the person who likes puzzles. I wish it had been longer but i would still recommend it. I loved the graphics.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Not exactly how I had hoped it would end... pretty confusing at parts but it tied a lot of lose ends ... though it ends with many unanswered questions .. but I know there's an after story book coming soon...
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|This album adds to the list of awesome music from the Piano Guys! Each track is dynamic and interesting to listen to...who knew a cello could be so cool?
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk really brought it with this album, so, so very easy to listen to.  Definitely their funkiest album to date, and I'm totally diggin' it.  Beautiful album, stellar work, guys.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I thought the e book was helpful and gave great in site . I would  would people too down load this e book  for the Kindle fire .
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|A must for the die hard Columbo fan. Whenever there's nothing on TV (usually) I pop in a disc and relive the fun. Oh, just one more thing...it's funny to see the past on TV...Columbo's first encounter with a phone answering machine, endings that hinge on the availability of a pay phone, smoking in hospitals....
B003EV6DBM|5.0|this was a good start for the new doctor. its tough to get use to a new actor when u really love the other one.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The Hill Climb is great fun and proved to be more of a challenge than I expected.  The true gamer will have few problems.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I used this for an interview but it was incredibly awkward due in large part to this excessively long cord.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is for people who love puzzles and not for the shoot it out crowd. It has lots of levels and I've had hours of quiet fun playing them.<br /><br />Yep, I could become a pipe fitter the way this game has me laying pipe. I'm on the last pack now the JUMBO PACK and it may think it has me beat but I've done 66 of the 150 boards in the Jumbo pack.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I have tried a few Virtual Connection Apps to connect my Android devices to my PCs.  This app is simple to setup, easy to use, and does a fantastic job.  I highly recommend it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS GAME. ITS INVIGORATING, LIVELY, FUN, INTENSE, AND THOSE DARN BOMBS JUST LOVE TO SPOIL MY RECORD. LOL. I'm so getting addicted that I've started to make Kung Fu sounds when playing the game. yes I'm a gonner over this game.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I've bought multiple items, each one sounds great, lightweight, fits well.  Unfortunately they just don't last.  I bought 2 of these 6 months ago and both have died.  Can't find any good alternatives.  If Sony would just make them reliable I'd pay twice as much.
0375869026|5.0|I purchased this book for my 10 yr old grandson after reading about it on Amazon.  He said all the 5th grade teachers in Fairfield(CT) are reading it to their classes.  The teacher only reads a few pages each day however he wanted the book as he wanted to know how it ends!  Being the voracious reader he is, he got right to it and finished it.  I want to borrow it and read it myself as he said it was a great story!
B004GJYROG|5.0|we loved this movie since the time came out, we watch again sometimes and still nonbored. Thanks & have a great day..!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Y'all...(yes, I'm Southern through and through)<br /><br />Whatever you're doing right now. Please, please just stop...trail your happy little index finger and thumb over to the BUY NOW with 1-CLICK icon and purchase Tangled! I could gush on and on about how hilarious this book is, but you'll never fully understand it unless you experience it yourself. It takes much convincing for me to throw in the towel and buy a book, because I have been highly disappointed when I have purchased a book off my Kindle only to get some fluff of a story that a 13-year old could have written. But FINALLY, FINALLY...I can breath and say with great pleasure (emphasis on pleasure...ahem) that Emma Chase has produced a WINNER! Yes, a WINNER! Have I also mentioned that it has to be really AWESOME or really BAD for me to even devote fifteen minutes of my time to write a review? Fortunately, Tangled is in the really AWESOME realm of my Kindle and it will forever remain there...don't you worry you fantastic little piece of digital goodness, I won't send you back to Amazon cyberspace, Tangled, cause you will be saved for those rainy days when I need a good dose of laughter and steamy fiction.<br /><br />I tend to ramble off on a tangent so I apologize in advance if my thoughts aren't collectively cohesive, but I'll be as detailed and honest as I can be so here I go with the good stuff.<br /><br />I won't dabble about the premise of the story seeing as to how it's pretty forth-telling in the description. Now why is this book really AWESOME? First, Emma Chase nails an accurately scary depiction of an average guy and his way of thinking through the POV of playboy Drew Evans.  This is the first time I have read an entire book written from the POV of the male character and I was not disappointed! Drew is crude, brutally honest, spoiled, selfish, vindictive, manipulative, sex fiend, etc. I could go on and on, but I'm pretty sure you get the gist of things.  He has a foul-mouth that will make you cringe and blush at the same time. I'll be honest, I don't care for most of the cursing so a warning to those who are \\"earmuffs\\" about it, you may want to prepare to skip over a lot of crude language. Anyways, Drew is the exact type of guy who does NOT want to go home to meet the parentals. Therefore, he steers clear of relationships.  His inner monologue though crude is entertaining, honest, and hilarious that you can't help but admit that most of it is sadly true to an extent.  He makes no apologizes about how he feels which made me dislike and like him at the same time.  He has a chance to redeem himself, though.  Second, Kate's sassiness is the perfect complement to Drew's crudeness. Their chemistry bounces off the pages (or glass if you wanna be technical) and you just KNOW it's going to be EXPLOSIVE! I also love the whole mid-west good girl persona Kate has going on yet underneath it we know she's a little (lot) frisky.  Plus, she doesn't put up with Drew's BS and that makes her more admirable and likable. The sex scenes are pretty drool worthy and steamy as well as the fantastic writing.  Emma Chase has a knack for combining hilarity and continuity in her writing.  Her writing makes for a refreshing read that I have been missing here lately with contemporary romances. The secondary characters are also great to add to the storyline...love The Bitch (aka Alexandra, his big sister) and MacKenzie (his adorable niece).  The Bad Word Jar and the conversations stemming from it will have you giggling and LOL'ing so don't read in public if you don't want random strangers thinking you're a mental basket-case ;). If you're looking for a light and entertaining read then do yourself a favor and buy this book! I know what you're thinking, because I thought the same thing...why would I waste $4.99 just to read some SOB mistreat women? He doesn't deserve the girl! Yeah, he really is a complete sack of donkey crap. But, well, I like to believe in this thing called redemption andsecond chances so you'll have to read the book to decide for yourself if Drew is worthy of Kate's affections!<br /><br />Hope my review is helpful and insightful.  If not, then I clearly didn't do a good job so I apologize ;). Happy Reading, folks!

0452289963|5.0|Eckhart teaches a simple and clear message.  This book has what it takes to change your life.  I also can't recommend enough his retreat series on DVD.  If you haven't had the experience of seeing Eckhart visually while hearing his teachings, I can tell you it adds a whole other dimension.  He emanates peace, joy and a great sense of humor.

1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle speaks with a clear voice and delivers a simple core message.  Like he says, you don't have to take his word for it, try it our for yourself!  I highly recommend his DVD retreat series because you get a whole other dimension of his teachings when you add the visual element of the peace and joy he emanates along with his sense of humor.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I have been playing for over 6 months daily and have only completed one room because I never get the items that are suppose to be in the treasure chests.  This is the only place you can get these if you're not on Facebook. In fact I've yet to see one of these items in the treasure chests. Why??? Makes me think this game is rigged.  Can this be fixed?  If this was corrected, I wouldn't mind spending money for credits.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids love this game and often take my kindle just to play it! I don't like the ads, but at least they are not located where they could accidentally tap them.

B001NXDIMK|5.0|OMG This is the BEST series since ER!!!!<br /><br />Great price and so addictive .....would recommend it to anyone who loves edge of your seat viewing. Each episode leaves you eager to see the next.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Couldn't stop playing until I solved the Mystery! Graphics are terrific!  You are compelled to continue!  Loved having to find objects and solving the puzzles, which were difficult enough but not so to be frustrating! Thanks, I can't wait to find more!
B00C061I3K|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of EDM music.  I've listened to a bit of Daft Punk in the past, but I wouldn't call myself a fan.  Trolling my iTunes shows I had four of their songs from various albums (basically the hits), and the video for Around The World, because I'm a big Michel Gondry fan.<br /><br />That out of the way, fans of Daft Punk knew that this was going to be a departure from their normal sound, as they eschewed their electronic sounds in lieu of real instruments.  As I write this, the response from the EDM crowd is very, very polarizing.  For fans who were looking for something different than the first single, \\"Get Lucky\\" will be disappointed, as the album takes that course through it's run.  For fans of \\"Get Lucky\\", you're in for a treat.  It's the best thing Pharrell has been involved with in a long, long time.  His other appearance on the album is great as well.  Touch is a song that feels like it spans three generations over it's 8 minute run time.<br /><br />Upon a few listens, this sound is very 'disco revival'.  Low, funky bass lines help an obvious 70's inspiration.  Comparing it to older tracks, such as One More Time or Around The World makes it seem like these are two different bands...not a problem for me.  Something makes me think Daft Punk was aiming to create their 'Thriller'.<br /><br />I suggest listening to the single first, and if you like it, pick up the album.  If you don't, steer clear.<br /><br />My standout tracks:<br />Give Life Back To Music<br />Lose Yourself To Dance (feat. Pharrell)<br />Touch (feat. Paul Williams)<br />Get Lucky (feat. Pharrell)

B009M4KTEM|5.0|I received this set as a birthday gift.  I expected the show to be much like other Jerry shows I have had and collected, especially the Kean College show of just two nights earlier. From the moment I popped the CD into the player, this thing jumps off the disk.  The sound is bright and crispy.  Jerry's voice is full and rich.  And, most of all, Jerry's playing is just super.  You just wait during each song for his solo, then another solo, then even a third, better, higher solo which seems to top off each song.  Love the Robert Hunter songs, with great Jerry solos, as well.  If you are hedging, Just Buy It!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was just amazing. Can't wait to read the others.  I never thought it would be such a great book. Y.C.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I can honestly say this book qualifies as the type of 'read' you find yourself wanting to put down for a while but simply can't bring yourself to do so. Much like seeing a terrible automobile accident on the freeway; your eyes are continuously drawn back to it. I found I was repeatedly hoping the 'Orphan Master' was a work of pure fiction but reading the bio told me the man knew of what he spoke, mores' the pity. A modern horror story, well written, with a decided ring of truth, set in a country we're hearing more and more about. Take the plunge....read it!

0441013597|5.0|I hate reading. In fact I hate to read books assigned to me by teachers. Hate reading textbooks or anything complex. Maybe because of my poor English, or maybe because it wasn't my strength, nonetheless, reading will never be my hobby. Ironic thing is, I read every day. May it be a text or an e-mail, those kinds are reading are straightforward. None of those complex wordings are present. Many books I was assigned to read has this complex writing style that can never be straightforward enough for me to understand. And until this day, I can't quite remember what the book is about because the wordings were that complex. Unnecessarily complex.<br />As I write this review, I was reading other people's review and noted that one of the reviewers said that his friend can't get past 20 pages of the book. I find it funny cause this is how it's like for me. Even though I hate reading, I do have a preference for some genres: fantasy, sci-fi, and thrillers.<br />Dune is a sci-fi book, taking place millennias into the future. This book was terribly wordy, unnecessarily wordy. But I guess it has to be to make it a novel. When I read, it's not because of the \\"elegant\\" style of the writing,(although it does set the background perfectly sometimes). I read for the plot. I read for enjoyment of what will unfold throughout the story. Books that can make me think (like the author and predict what he will write next).<br />Dune is one of those amazing books where the setting is in the future, but the protagonists and antagonists are exceptionally different from other sci-fi. There is no magic involved in this book. There is however, prescience which is sort of a superhuman power in the book. To me the plot of this book is amazing because it's not something I can think of. And if anyone doesn't like this book, I do implore them to create something better instead of criticizing.<br />This book is like the real world, political entities fighting for power and money. The different Houses thatrule the planets is to be expected in a book like this. But what's unexpecting is how Frank Herbert wrote it in a way that includes a balance of power (that can be easily broken down because of insecurity and greed). But I guess this is how Herbert operate/intended for Dune. I also like the fact that there are different schools that depends on mélange (or spice) to obtain ocular power and currency power. In addition, to space travel, mélange is needed so the fight over the monopoly of mélange is also a great addition to the book. Also the description of the sandworms that creates mélange is very impressive.<br />Lovers of sci-fi/fantasy would probably imagine themselves as part of the book. Almost like the movie matrix, but this book is better. Although the movie itself was not so great. I do recommend lovers of sci-fi to read this book and read the sequels up to its finale which is the 8th book (Sandworms of Dune).<br />These books made me like reading again.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Four years have passed since JJ Abrams' last Star Trek film. And it was well worth the wait. Diehard Trek fans as well as new fans to the franchise will enjoy this fast-paced, action-packed adventure. Those familiar with the original series will, of course, catch more clues and references to the impending story and correlation to the alternate version. And this super-fan was not disappointed in the least. My one complaint is that Abrams could stand to tone down the lens flares during the bridge scenes.<br /><br />Full of intense fight scenes, drama, suspense, intrigue, and plenty of humor, Star Trek Into Darkness is an excellent sequel. And while I loved the story, the strong point for the film is the characters.  We had the backstory and groundwork set in the previous film, and here we see the characters grow and their relationships develop. The cast and acting is spot-on, once again. Chris Pine (Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock), and Simon Pegg (Scotty) have great, central roles in this film. I wish Karl Urban (Bones) had more screen time. I think he's fantastic. And of course, Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant in his complex, villainous role.<br /><br />While some of the big mystery reveals were a bit predictable, especially to fans, I think it served as a respectable homage.  I only hope we don't have to wait another four years to see another installment. But with Abrams focusing on Star Wars next, Star Trek will need to pass on to another director for that to happen. A strong foundation has been laid here with this alternate crew with limitless possibilities for new stories and adventures, whether it be more films, tv, or novels. I'll certainly be going to see this one a few more times in the theater, especially on IMAX. The 3D screening was nice, but after the first hour I forgot about it. Beyond the first few scenes, I don't think the 3D is necessary. Either way, don't miss this exciting sequel.<br /><br />Review previously posted at SciFiChick.

B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Lights up the campsite for a small package.  I love the 3 modes: bright, dimmer, and flash for roadside emergencies.  Really, you can't improve much on this light.  The hook on the bottom feels a little cheap, but it works just fine.  No complaints.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A true tribute to man's intelligence and tenacity and loyalty to our fellows. Would read more books from this author.
B00340LM8C|5.0|This is one of the great films.  Cary Grant is at his best and the setting and time warp is great to watch for the nostalgia.  Right up there with North by Northwest.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I know, odd story-a bit difficult to follow, some unforgivable make up and at close to three hours, a commitment, but if this movie connects with you, as it did with me, you wont forget it.<br />It stays with you, lingers, you want to watch it again to figure out some of the mysteries, rewatch seens over and over to connect the dots. Of course if this film doesn't connect, you will shut it off half way through and roll your eyes, but you have to give it a chance to find out. I can't tell you how many people I've talked to about Cloud Atlas, and they tell me right after they seen the film they brought the soundtrack....just like I did, DON'T PREJUDGE, give it a chance, find out if you are one of those people, and if you are, congratulations, you just supported one of the most darring and best films of the year......and have fun listening to the soundtrack!
1400067820|3.0|having a soft spot for Taleb (his books inspired me to pursue a graduate degree in Statistics), the book didn't meet my (high) expectations.<br /><br />Pros: - ballsy perspective<br />- humility towards complex systems<br />- entertaining anecdotes<br />- stressing ubiquitous non-linearity of dependencies<br /><br />Cons: - too many Ayn Rand-ish rants that go nowhere<br />- most billionaires are lucky, BUT somehow Steve Jobs is anti-fragile? wondering if the author wasn't... fooled by randomness, eh?<br />- Atlas Shrugged is anti-fragile? well, s*it, so is Glenn Beck, the point being?<br /><br />Biggest gripe: Taleb hasn't given a single example of TRUE anti-fragility. Only anti-fragility... to a point. Immune system benefits from stressers, but only to a certain degree, even financial options will not benefit from volatility resulting in a complete chaos and obliterating the whole financial system.

B002KKCVY6|2.0|Not as sturdy as my last pair of Teva's. Why do they have to always fix things that aren't broken?
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I really liked the realism in this movie. I felt like I was there, it was so realistic.  You can feel the frustration of mom and son, just trying to survive. I would recommend the movie to anyone.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|A long time Star Trek fan, I naturally headed for the film the moment it was released in my area.  I saw the 3D version.  The film is action-filled, laden with special effects, and incorporates legendary ST baggage: the by-now parodistic banter between Kirk and Spock, and Kirk and McCoy, and Spock and McCoy, etc.  Karl Urban as McCoy, particularly, seems to be phoning it in, but perhaps it is not his fault: perhaps no grown man in the galaxy, can, at this point in time, sincerely wrap his mouth around another, \\"Good God, man . .. !\\" or \\"Are you out of your corn-fed mind!?\\"  There are gaping holes (presumably, e.g., if the Enterprise would be incinerated by entering Earth's atmosphere at those speeds, so would the other ship).  The \\"underwear\\" scene with Alice Eve is, you should pardon the expression, nakedly gratuitous, and the writing for her and a petulantly drawn Lt. Uhura really awful, not to mention that the women are allowed to look like magazine covers, with lots of close-ups that show how much eye-makeup they wear, even in deep space, and that doesn't ever seem to be disturbed by catastrophic events, or tears, or the prospect of imminent death, ditto their gleaming hair, which remains bouncy and sleek through all.  The writing is simplistic, and Kirk reminds one of nothing so much as a high school jock - in fact, most of the acting is at the high school jock level,  except . . .<br /><br />for Benedict Cumberbatch, whose presence reminds one that there was, after all, an adult actor on the set.  Cumberbatch easily walks off with the film, but he can take only partial credit for that: he was given little competition, unless you want to count the suspiciously enhanced-looking blue of Chris Pine's eyes.<br /><br />Sometimes I wonder what would happen to ST if writers got their hands on it who were willing to let some of the older baggage go and offer us the kind of great writing and character development that, e.g., \\"Aliens\\" offered in addition to the special effects thrills.<br /><br />Without Cumberbatch, this is just a run of the mill Star Trek exercise - if you love ST, you'll probably forgive most of its flaws.  If you admire Cumberbatch, it's worth the price of admission to watch as his skill, unconventionally attractive looks, and luscious baritone tear holes in ST cliches.  If you like both ST and Cumberbatch, well, what the hell, you'll probably end up seeing it twice.<br /><br />If you don't care much for either the Star Trek franchise or Cumberbatch, save your money and go out to dinner instead.
B00B04NJLW|5.0|Reading all the negative reviews makes me wonder if anyone really knew what they were getting into.25 international and independent filmmakers were given the chance to make a short film involving death,destruction and general mayhem.Grant it,there are a couple of bad ones,but the greatness out weighs that on every level.In this age of crappy remakes,found footage films,zombies and 3D on EVERY movie made,The ABCs Of Death reminds you that independent horror is alive and well,you just got to look for it a little harder.And if you dont appreciate the glory and wonder of \\"F is for Fart\\",you shouldnt be watching this film PERIOD.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I have now seen this movie 5 times and I love it every time.  What a great cast of actors in this movie and they all do a wonderful job.  I was quite impressed with Justin Timberlake - didn't think he could act, but he was great.

B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My nieces love reading this book and never tire of it.  It is a darling book with great illustrations and darling message.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|My 3.5 year old loves to play this &#34;game&#34; - which I encourage as a way to learn fundamental math concepts.<br /><br />This is important because I am an Indian dad, and the competition among the other 3 year olds is very tough. If he doesn't finish the game before the end of the summer, we are going to have some problems. He may have to go to one of those regular schools I've heard of.<br /><br />All kidding aside, the design of the game is perfect for any child who has an interest or aptitude for this type of logical thinking, irrespective of the recommended age ranges. I'm really looking forward to more titles from this developer.
B000ID1J40|4.0|Just the right amount of suspense, humor and intrigue. Great move, worth watching. I've seen it many times and always enjoy it.

0671449028|5.0|I love Sandra Boynton books. This is one of my favorites in her collection, and I often buy this as a baby shower/welcome baby gift. My kids -- 4 and 6 -- still love reading it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Really liked the book, I could hardly put it down. The story is really touching and well written. It's been a long time since I haven't cried reading a book. Highly recommend!!!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|First off, I enjoy reading a book that doesn't throw you into the action without explaining the characters' past. I am meaning, of course, that I didn't read the novella.<br /><br />Yet Milan made it seem as if I should have, not in a bad way. I actually enjoyed the mystery of Lydia's and Minnie's scandals, and the characters had such a way with their conversation that I knew there was a secret there and wanted in, but it wasn't dropped in casually like in other books. In this story, I felt left out of a great and terrible secret, and it made me want to finish the story and find out. I love how I couldn't guess the secret, because most books often paint it in such an obvious manner that everything is spoiled by the time of 'The Great Unveiling'.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Robert immensely. Not only does he deviate from the brooding, sarcastic yet tremendously soft-hearted male hero we usually find, but he's hilarious. And I think it's so funny that the comments Minnie confused as coy and scandalous from him are actually him being so embarrassed in front of her that he spouts of exactly what's on his mind--like commenting on her breasts. He's helplessly romantic and hilarious at the same time.<br /><br />Minnie, too, has to be one of my all-time favorite heroines. She's calculating, pragmatic, yet not severe enough to be cold-hearted. It's refreshing to meet a heroine that isn't naive or overly-dramatic. I can easily imagine her character--so focused on strategy and The Game. Most writers are so focused on a brilliant character that they fail to include the shortcomings that often accompany such brilliance.<br /><br />It was truly a pleasure reading this book, and I greatly recommend it for others as well.
B00BU9DXAY|3.0|did not expect the book to be soo short.. as in maybe 15 pages.. was a bit dissapointed by that.. cute story but when i finish a book in under 15 minutes i get a little bummed out..
B00AJF87QU|5.0|Stereophonics once again do not disappoint with this album. I can't say enough about how I love Kelly's signature rasp, and now, with songs like Indian Summer, Been Caught Cheating, and Take Me? Wow.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's an okay game. I'm glad it was the free app of the day though. It's a slow moving game with things that do cost real money IF you don't want to or are too impatient to wait for health or leveling up. Graphics are nice and storyline is good.
0307352153|5.0|Really fantastic book - great to read for yourself, or to give as a gift to other &#34;Quiet&#34; people you know.  I had so many &#34;aha&#34; moments - will definitely help you understand yourself or other introverted people much better.  Really glad I read it.

B007QUUJMG|4.0|I found it an interesting account of how teenagers think and relate to there peers and parents.<br />Parents of adolecents should definitely read this book.
B00BUT5I84|2.0|I like this band to a degree. I have never felt a part of the raid fandom that surrounds them but own their albums. I liked the stylistic change they did with This Is War and despite it being different it was also very diverse and enjoyable. I can't say the same for this new effort.<br /><br />This album sounds like a throwaway 80s glam rock album with \\"try hard\\" lyrics. Nothing really stands out. Unlike previous efforts this album lacks truly big choruses or anything that could be called catchy. It all bleeds together with way too much going on. The synth is poorly layered so it becomes overbearing. Its not the worst thing I have ever heard and I can't say I had the highest expectations after hearing the singles but this album was just poorly executed. I will check out future releases but this album is just a disappointment. Vocals have sounded better, lyrics have been better, and the music itself in previous efforts has not been so \\"80s\\". I can't hear the life or energy in this album. Its just pretentiousness to a bunch of synth and gang vocals. It wants to have a grand feel but comes off extremely generic and boring. I would recommend skipping it or picking it up on sale. In regards to the band themselves hopefully they can release something a bit stronger next time. As another review said this is comparable to Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns which is in no way a compliment. I get some people like that album but it was pretty lifeless too. Though at least that album had some meaning in the songs despite the lack of energy and the lifelessness.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|This game is ok related to all the other angry birds but the most stupid thing is it require Facebook my two kids played this and they said it requires facebook like com on really what about kids 12 and under its not fair to them twelve years people need to wait to play this this is my first time seeing a game and it requires facebook and its angry birds I'm shocked I thought it would be a more gayer game I can't believe it!!!!!
0385344228|1.0|This book was such a snooze.  I found myself skipping over paragraphs and when something \\"happened\\" that was supposed to be exciting... I felt nothing.  It felt like a 12 year old was telling a story saying, this happened, then that happened, then this, then that.  NO detail on what should have been big moments in the book.  And the ending was predictable about 3 chapters from the end.  The only reason I finished it is b/c a friend and I were reading it and she couldn't stand it anymore, so I finished it so I could tell her what happens.  LAME.
1451635672|4.0|I loved the movie. I wanted to read the book to catch the little details. The book supplies a lot of details. It pretty much follows the movie. Or I guess I should say the movie follows the book.

B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is a really fun and awesome game. It takes up a lot of room on your kindle, but it's totally worth it. It worth 99 cents. If you are bored, I suggest that you get this game.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Ok first off this product worked wonders, it got my PS3 to run at its first fan setting rather than the 5th as soon as I applied it. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars were minor: 1) the tube I received was a little broken (not a big deal as it was just the plunger) 2) the price was a little high compared to some other places I have seen (But I still usually trust Amazon, especially over ebay, and the order was worth the couple extra dollars so I could save on not having to pay shipping on another item) and 3) the product doesn't come in a small enough size to just do one job, so its just going to be collecting dust, unless another problem comes up, which to me seems a little wasteful.<br />As for the quality of the product it does exactly what it is advertised to do, it does drop the temperature a great deal, so if I ever ran into a need to put on more thermal compound, I would absolutely use this product again, and if I someone I know needs to have a new application I would recommend this product without hesitation.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|I was moved by this story and also the way Dr Eben Alexander presented his experience.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|The beginning was difficult to read because a lot of it was from Jack's point of view. You have to persevere until it becomes apparent what has happened and then you are hooked into not being able to put the book down. An awakening happens. It makes you realize the developmental deficit that occurs in situations of this nature, especially in the current events where life has imitated fiction.

B004OR199G|5.0|I loved the way Kris is herself in the book.  She tells it like it is with no BS'ing in the mix.  I am even starting to slowly incorporate some of the ideas, since I have had cancer once and now I possibly have it in a difference area.  I want to do things naturally and not with a bunch of drugs that could do more damage than good.  Thanks for putting the info out there Kris!!
B005PK1G76|5.0|- Cup holders that are great for mom/dad or kids<br />- zippered pocket was nice to hold keys, wallet, etc.<br />- nice open storage area for toys, pacifiers, snacks, etc.<br /><br />Overall, I am super happy purchasing this item vs. the BOB stroller organizer.<br />This one is much more affordable, durable, and has more storage.<br />Love it!

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I liked this book because it took me on many adventures through out the story.This was one of my most favorite books that I've read.
B008220D5K|1.0|I have watched all the classic Judd Apatow films and enjoyed them.  Until this...  This is the most self-indulgent, poorly written piece of garbage I've seen in a long time.  It made me angry.  It is depressing, and just makes one hate society and these characters are positively irredeemable.  After reading many of the five star reviews of this movie....I feel even sadder.  To all the people who found this movie so funny because they \\"relate\\" to it ... wow...all I can say is I am sorry.  This movie combined with the sick glowing reviews of this miserable couple is evidence of the degradation of society and culture in general.  Also the film portrays women in such a sexist stero-typical manner that the women in this film should be ashamed of themselves for participating in it.
B003VS0CYC|3.0|This is not worth buying unless you didn't have it before. The video isn't that much better then the DVD release.
0307592731|5.0|I read Wild last year and it was amazing! I felt as though I was on that journey, actually was Cheryl. That's how deeply involved I was. It was consumed in two days even though I was rereading a lot of it as I was going. I then purchased a copy and sent it to my best friend out West who did the same and it became the fodder of many conversations. It's a keeper!
193700788X|1.0|I think I am entitled to a better ending for Sookie.<br />I bought three different formats for most of these books<br />and recommended your writing to several of my friends.<br />I am extremmely disappointed. Im sorry but everything that Erik and Sookie<br />had been through, they deserve to be together. Sam really!!!<br />you have got to be kidding me. By the way without your readers you have nothing<br />just encase you have forgotten. you have no right to get mad at us for wanting and<br />expecting better. Every since that stupid series came out on HBO your last three books have<br />suffered. How could you let HBO do that to your books? You were a really good writer what has happened?<br />I am not sure I will buy any more of your books there are to many good authors out there who respect there<br />readers to waste my money on ones who don't. I will tell you, I don't care what you wrote but in my version<br />of this story Sookie and Erik are together in the end. I don't like giving negative reviews and this is out<br />of character for me my mom used to say if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all but, I loved<br />these books so much and in the last three books you destroyed it all. I would not recommend this book. I can't<br />believe I am saying this very disappointed.<br /><br />Barbara

B007IXWL2C|2.0|Loved the flow of the first two books.  Loved Christian and Ana' s characters.  Ana came across as a mature 21 yr old .  From the beginning of book 3, she goes out of character and behaves like a ten yr old.  Comes across as bratty and annoying.  I put the book down Five times, but figured come this far, just finish.  An epilogue at the end of book two would have been a good thing.
1451695187|5.0|Well written, this book reads like a novel.  It goes beyond &#34;90 minutes in Heaven.&#34;  I've purchased additional copies as gifts.
B00B29J0I6|2.0|My son loved it at first, but then the levels stopped progressing despite beating the previous one, and stopped showing the collected gears. Even if we got all the gears and successfully beat the level, it showed that we beat it, but didn't show any gears and didn't open up the next level. Very disappointed and son frustrated.

B0044DEAUA|1.0|I had been driving a rental and it had blue toothe in it and I loved using it so when I got my 2004 Mercedes back from the shop I was so bummed it didnt have a bluetoothe option for my phone ...and to add that through a Mercedes dealer would be thousands of dollars..I checked...anyways I put this little thing on my visor and paired with my iphone and there is was crystal clear sound..with VOICE CONTROL..and it hears me correctly everytime!! I am in LOVE !!! for $39 you cannot beat it !! I am buying one for my sons 2004 Truck !!! Its the greatest thing ever!!<br /><br />*** So 2 months later and NOT LOVING so much anymore...<br />you are to store the machine on your visor..but I park in and outside parking lot and I live in FLA so eveytime I get inmy car the device is so HOT just from being in the car ..that it WONT turn ON or anything...it takes a good 10 minutes in the AC to cool off enough to actually come on...it takes me 7 min to get home so totally useless. If you live in a hot place Dont bother...now I have to take it in my purse with me everyday which sucks because if someone calls me and I answer it at work the blue toothe automatically picks up on it and my conversationis now PROJECTED into the whole room....unless I remember to turn it off and on everytime I remove it...Cmon people this defeats the whole hands free purpose. UGH

B005GFPZYK|3.0|This book provides an understanding of what it means to be a Seal.  On the surface it seems that Seals are  some kind of super hero but by the end of this book it seems that they are egocentrics.

B009VLX8FS|4.0|This was classic Taylor Swift all the way. I got a great deal on this album and it was very worth it.
B001EAWME2|3.0|This was an okay slasher predating the classic Halloween.  I thought the phone calls were creepy.  And there was kind of a dread throughout.  Not the best but enjoyable.  Fav part was when he was yelling I wanna lick it, lick it.  Then it goes quiet and he say in a gentle voice Im gonna kill you.  Thought that was very effective.  Blu ray looks ok but its a pretty old low budget slasher from the early seventies, so I didnt expect it to look great.

0385349831|5.0|\\"And to those who believe that adventures are dangerous, I say, try routine; that kills you far more quickly.\\" ~ pg. 54<br /><br />Manuscript Found in Accra is the latest novel from internationally known best-selling author Paulo Coelho. It is set in Jerusalem on July 14, 1099. A community of Christians, Arabs and Jews assemble to seek guidance of a Greek philosopher named Copt. He summoned the people of Jerusalem to ask questions as they await the invasion of crusaders. The townspeople have questions about fear, defeat, love, loyalty, success, faith and many more topics we experience as humans. The Copt answers the questions in a precise, beautiful way. Simple wisdom at its finest.<br /><br />Manuscript Found in Accra follows the tradition of The Alchemist and of Paulo Coelho's tweets. The parables are brief lessons full of wisdom and spiritual themes that will inspire readers and maybe spur a moment of reflection. It may be a short novel at less than 200 pages but it is meaningful and guaranteed to impact readers' lives.<br /><br />\\"Therefore, Lord, give us this day our daily miracle. And forgive us if we are not always capable of recognizing it.\\" ~ pg. 137<br /><br />Manuscript Found in Accra has certainly made my Best Books of the year list. It is a book I will definitely re-read because the knowledge within applies to my everyday life and actually changed my perspective on a couple things. I'm glad I did not hesitate adding this book to my personal library for reading pleasure and as a life reference. If you thought The Alchemist was a life-changing book, then you will appreciate this profound read.<br /><br />\\"Solitude is not the absence of Love, but its complement. If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself.\\" ~ pgs. 29-30<br /><br />Literary Marie of Precision Reviews
B000V6BE6C|1.0|The reason I wanted this CD was for one particular song.  I couldn't wait to play it.  All the songs played fine until it got to this last song and then it skipped all over the place.  It wouldn't play at all.  That was a huge disappointment but since I paid less than $3 for the disc, I wasn't going to send it back.

B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|From a production standpoint, Random Access Memories sounds phenomenal. It's music as a gourmet lollipop. Total ear candy. An audiophile's best friend. What more could one ask for? What indeed...<br /><br />First, how about something new? Daft Punk explored very similar sounds on their 2001 masterpiece \\"Discovery.\\" Back then, their shift from underground house and techno stylings to a vibrant hybrid of \\"uncool\\" sounds from 70's and 80's AM radio was not only novel, it took guts to pull off. Now, two proper albums and twelve years later, DP are falling backward rather than pushing their music forward. Even worse, what really sets RAM apart from Discovery is the extent to which it slavishly imitates its influences rather than forge something new and identifiably D-Punkian. If you're already stocked up on Chic and Earth, Wind & Fire records and still can't get enough of those grooves, by all means enjoy the feast that awaits you here. But if not, you're better off getting the originals rather than the comparably tame knock-offs. For instance, \\"Get Lucky\\" and \\"Lose Yourself to Dance\\" both feature some classic funky licks from Chic's Nile Rogers, not to mention singer Pharrell Williams' best impersonation of EW&F. The songs are close to being a perfect fusion of the two bands, and yet Pharrell's voice sounds thin and forced compared to the smooth disco legends of yore, and his lyrics are just embarrassing. Plus, nowhere in the songs do the personality of its creators (remember, Daft Punk?) really pop out. Discovery is more than a decade old now, and it still sounds fresher than this one. So does \\"Moon Safari,\\" the 1998 album by Air. You know, that other French electronic duo who fused M.O.R. music from similar eras into a sound that the loungier tracks of R.A.M. come very close to duplicating---but alas, not quite.<br /><br />Second, how about something with a little more life to it? Even if you just want to ape your childhood heroes, at least do it with abandon. With the exception of the slightly more outr&eacute; narrative compositions \\"Giorgio on Moroder\\" and \\"Touch,\\" so much of this record feels safe, predictable, over-calculated, and bloodless. The lyrics are mind-numbingly superficial, just clich&eacute;d disco or ballad boilerplate. Don't get me wrong, Homework and Discovery weren't deep either, but their mish-mash of styles were darn inspired, often transcendent. By comparison, this can be ponderous, stodgy, even a bit preachy in its promotion of pop's past. Judging from the promotional features, it seemed as if Daft Punk were nursing some high ambitions with this record, and yet it's the most conservative thing I've heard in some time. Worse, it's completely guarded: these fuddy-duddies hiding in Robo helmets have obscured their own personalities within their perfected replication of bygone eras.  Kraftwerk sounds more expressive than this, and they were trying really hard to keep the robot thing up! Bangalter and de Homem-Christo, on the other hand, obsessing over the sonic details of their musical wax museum, have left all of the human touches to their guests. Ultimately, the Robots only care to give us a well-crafted dance \\"product,\\" a rich gourmet lollipop (with authentic nostalgia flavor!), a classy alternative to Skrillex, and hope we don't crave something more substantial.<br /><br />Some will be perfectly fine with this luxury confection. They'll eat it up without a second thought. Me, I'll pare this down to the eight best songs (i.e., the ones that aren't completely boring), and have a grooving, non-intrusive soundtrack to spreadsheet maintenance and household chores.

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Mads Mikkelson is amazing as Hannibal. I hope they do a second season. He is so controlled and precise with just a hint of the brutality that lurks beneath the surface. The stories each week are very good. All-round good acting by all characters. Very good series.

B004742Y68|3.0|This was a fun afternoon entertainment bringing me back to my past. I watched this when it first aired many, many years ago.  I did notice a few clips were taken out; I assume to make the film fit into a specific time slot.  I would have liked it better if the film was intact without missing clips.<br /><br />Still enjoyed watching it and will most likely watch it again.

1400052181|5.0|So glad I found this book. So glad the author cared.  The medical community never ceases to amaze me with the depth of their deception. Now that we have made progress beyond in your face &#34;Jim Crow&#34; why is Henrietta Lacks story still kept quiet. I consider myself to be a well read and educated individual in the sciences. A public school science teacher and never in any of my undergraduate nor graduate studies have I read the Henrietta Lacks story. With the impact her life had on medicine Henrietta Lacks contribution should be front and center in every student science textbook. I thank the author Rebecca Skloot for caring enough to put a face, and life to this remarkable medical contribution. This book gives anyone who reads it a lot to think about when it comes to our bodies and what can be taken without our knowledge and consent.  And to student text book writers and publishers you are leaving out a major topic of cellular biology. A well written and captivating story. A must read

I would nto watch this movie high or you will be very confused at the end.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. The controls are very responsive and the game play is rewarding. Unlocking the better planes give you something to play for. Great game!

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I own Osmos on PC and I can honestly say this port is flawless. The touchscreen controls actually make the game better in my opinion. Very challenging in the later levels but still fun and rewarding.
0062103377|5.0|Bobby is one of my favorite characters in the series, and I feel like this book captured his voice almost perfectly, and in the spots that were just &#34;almost&#34;, I forgave it pretty readily. It explained certain things about Bobby and his past, and it broke my heart and made me laugh and I was utterly pleased.<br /><br />There are lots of pictures in it, which is thrilling to me. They make it a treat to read. I love the way the cover is designed too, it looks nice and the text and picture are shiny and slightly raised, so I like to stare at it and run my fingers over it (but I'm easily amused).<br /><br />====SLIGHT SPOILERS!====<br /><br />Now, because I've seen season 7, I initially thought this book was about a different &#34;24 hours to live&#34; than it is (book takes place at the end of season 6), which made the explanation of what's going on confusing to the point of shock for me. On the second read through, everything made much more sense. This would not have been an issue if season 7 had not gone like it had, probably.<br /><br />There are a few things in this book that clash with an episode in season 7, but if you wiggle around somewhere between the book and the episode, you might be able to find a nice medium between the two like I did, and I'm satisfied with that.<br /><br />Also, the two chapters are not told from Bobby's point of view, and I believe that while the author's Bobby Singer voice is actually very good, the voice for the character point of view in those two chapters is fairly lacking.<br /><br />=====================

193700788X|1.0|[warning - spoilers] I have been a big fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series and have not submitted a negative comment on a book before. However, Dead Ever After was so poorly thought out and written as a final chapter to a great series that I felt I had to.  If I could give this book a negative 10 score, I would.  All of the characters created by CH have become three- dimensional for me and I am not a committed supporter of Eric, Bill or Sam as Sookie's HEA. I can even accept CH's choice of Sam for Sookie, since it is hard to think of Eric or Bill as Sookie's \\"soul-mate\\" or \\"life partner\\", being vampires (and quite dead). However, if CH wanted to conclude the series with Sookie choosing Sam, she chose a very strange way of doing it. After Sookie saves Sam's life with the cluviel dor, Sam is reclusive and appears ungrateful to Sookie for saving his life. Then, when Sookie is put in jail, Sam agrees to Eric's demand that he have no contact with Sookie if Eric will post Sookie's bail. Sam comes off as a beta male, with Eric staying the alpha male. Sam bargains away his right to pursue Sookie for just $30,000. Pretty pathetic excuse for a man!<br /><br />I also am appalled at the way CH trashed Eric in DEA. He did not deserve that treatment, since his meekly accepting bondage to Freyda and suggesting that Sookie follow him to Oklahoma to be a hidden mistress is totally out of character for him. Also, Bill deserved one last chance to redeem himself in Sookie's eyes. Rather than mope about Sookie not ending up with either Eric or Bill (or Alcide) in subsequent negative comments posted on the book, I think it would be great if other fans could suggest plot lines for DEA that could have established Sam as being worthy of Sookie. After all, since CH created the Sookie Stackhouse world, it is her right to decide who Sookie ends up with. Besides being an interesting project, it would serve an additional purpose of establishing how easy it would have been for CH to honor her fans by thinking up a story line that allowed Sookie to end up with Sam in a convincing manner, while still providing a dignified and honorable exit for Eric and Bill. This would then help explain why so many fans feel that DEA was an insult inflicted on the loyal readers (and a particularly nasty insult directed at Eric fans).<br /><br />For example, why not have the cluviel dor change Sam, so that he awoke from death energized, grateful to Sookie and realizing that she must truly love him in order to sacrifice her one magic wish on him instead of on Eric. Instead of changing into a collie, Sam could start changing into a Bengal tiger in order to emphasize his newly found alpha male personality (and maybe even kill some of King Felipe's vampires to save Sookie's life in the middle of the book).<br /><br />Instead of the nonsense about the devil, Copley Carmichael and Claude, the focal point of DEA could have been the resolution of how Eric schemes to get out of his bondage to Freyda and keep Sookie, even though forced at the beginning of the book to dissolve his marriage to Sookie.  Sookie could agonize over her established love for Eric and her new attraction to Sam, who has been changed by the cluviel dor and who is actively pursuing Sookie. Perhaps Bill could have discovered some loophole due to his vampire genealogical research that could ultimately be used by Eric to break his bondage to Freyda. Freyda and Felipe de Castro do not accept this outcome and Bill, Eric, Sookie and Sam battle Felipe and Freyda in a final epic battle. Bill dies in the battle in order to save Sookie (redeeming himself and dying in Sookie's arms), but Sookie, Eric and Sam are left standing at the end. Sam (shapeshifted into a Bengal tiger) proves his worth as a warrior at Eric's side during the battle.  At the end of this DEA, Eric realizes that if he truly loves Sookie, he needs to leave in order for Sam to provide Sookie with the happy ending (and family) that she deserves. Having killed Felipe de Castro, Eric becomes the King of Nevada, Arkansas and Louisiana, moves to New Orleans, and leaves Pam in charge as the local Sheriff.<br /><br />In my ideal DEA that CH could have written, at the end of the book Sookie and Sam are sitting on the porch of her house drinking lemonade. There is a full moon out that night and a tapestry of stars shine overhead. The scent of lilacs surrounds the house. Bubba has moved into Bill's house and is in the cemetery singing a song of lost love and new love found. The Weres can be heard in the deep woods howling as they hunt. The sealed fae portal can be seen in the distance shimmering slightly, a faint line of changing colors, shifting in resonance to Bubba's song. The effect of the cluviel dor is that Sookie sometimes hears Sam's thoughts and sometimes not, but she has found that when she does hear his thoughts, she doesn't mind at all, because she almost always likes what he is thinking. On the porch that night, she hears him worry about whether their children will have a difficult life being part fae and part shapeshifter. Sookie reassures him that she has learned one thing living all these years in Bon Temps. The world is a strange and dangerous, but beautiful place - and sometimes you have to accept the strangeness in you, because what may be strange and not \\"normal\\" may be the one thing that helps you survive in this crazy world.<br /><br />I am not an author, but I imagine there are other fans who have the talent to think up a fitting plot line for DEA that would have served CH's purpose better than the truly awful drivel she served up in DEA. Give it a try and post your ideas!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />One SVM fan has accepted the challenge and has come up with their own alternate ending to DEA:<br /><br />http://whatisafterdea.wordpress.com/

B00CL50LEC|5.0|What a movie! At first when I bought this I thought it was gonna be corny. Boy was I wrong this movie surprised me a lot. The actors in it were excellent and the story moved along well. I did read some other reviews that the story lagged but I didn't think that at all. What a wonderful twist on a love story. And I love how the zombie theme was not over played. My favorite characters besides the two main characters had to be M or Marcus and Julie's best friend. I also loved the music that was in the movie as a matter of fact I ended up buying the song \\"Midnight City\\" and \\"Shell suite\\" excellent songs !! Since I have bought this movie I have watched it every day LOVE IT!! Another Sleeper Block Buster in my Opinion!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I wanted this set, but the price was prohibited.  Amazon had a one day special on it for about half price.  I jumped at it, called a friend who liked the show, as well, and we ended up ordering two sets.  I haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but know I will enjoy many hours of watching this old show.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Daft Punk mixes funky with electronica to create a new genre of music (sort of). No regrets in buying this album. Love it.
0679805273|5.0|Such a timeless classic for all ages.  I first discovered it when my son graduated from highschool several years ago, and I was delighted to donate it to my grandson's pre-school class before they moved up to the next level. I only wish that the publisher would do an interactive digital version which could be personalized with your specific child's name and photos.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Columbo was even better than when I watched it on TV.  No Commercials.  I would recommend this series to any mystery buff.  They are made to watch again and again.  The Complete Series is the way to go.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome app. I have really enjoyed my experience with it and I  highly recommend it to everyone. You will bave- possitive experience with it as well. I use my kindle a lot. I take it with me everywhere I go.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is by far the most fun I have had playing a game on my android phone. I recommend it highly.
B00CNZ17DO|5.0|Rock album of the year!!  If you love AC/DC then you'll love Airbourne.  From start to finish this album rocks, great guitar riffs!!
B004G7UTXG|4.0|This is a historical movies about the tragedy to the natives in South America by the Spaniards and Portugese. The action and scenery were very well shown. The acting was fairly good. The role of the Catholic church in the exploitation of the indians is considerably cleansed. While not totally historically accurate, it is an interesting movie that is well acted.
B00669MFA2|3.0|The last installment of Harry Potter cycle is entertaining (and better by far than part 1), but more could have done to humanize the main characters.  The fast-forward at the end of the movie was particularly rapid and understated.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|This movie is intentionally obscure and hard to follow. I usually will watch almost anything to the end. I quit this after 15 minutes. I cannot recommend it at all.
B006VP1OYO|5.0|Prior to 1991 the &#34;shoegazer&#34; group My Bloody Valentine released only two full-length albums but acquired a significant cult following.  In 2013 they released one disc of all-new material but, for my money, this is the more desirable purchase.  These EP's demonstrate a greater range of sonic styles than the major releases may suggest.  Whether you will like it or not is another question.  If you've never heard of MBV I suggest you break yourself in with Verruca Salt, Jesus & Mary Chain, or even Sonic Youth, some of the top names in the &#34;noise-rock&#34; genre, consisting of pretty melodies laid atop (occasionally) shrieking industrial sounds.  With MBV the noise is in the forefront and the airy vocals and melody line drift through the background.  At its best, nevertheless, it was haunting.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It works well at sharpening small knives, but the plastic is cheap and may break if it falls on something hard enough. A good buy otherwise.
B0000636NQ|5.0|This TYA show was recorded at a fabled venue called Klook's Kleek, under entertaining circumstances as related in the liner notes.  Order the expanded version, as it has many of the rhythm'n'booze favorites like &#34;I'm Going Home,&#34; performed with raw power.  In subsequent albums TYA would become showoffish and, by the time of &#34;I'd Love to Change the World,&#34; singles-oriented and even mellow.  But the late Alvin Lee earned his place in rock history with this 'un.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|The book was moderately entertaining if not a little confused in some of its story telling.  The movie helps to explain some parts of the novel that were murky.  This is particularly true of the final story of the Islander.  In the book, the author uses the same annoying pidgin language to narrate the tale.  It gave me a head ache.  In the film, there should have been subtitles to to along with the new speak but there is enough action that the continuity is not too badly maimed.  I did enjoy the use of the cast in multiple roles.  My favorite story in the book was the escaping oldsters.  This actually worked for me in the film.  Had I not read the book I would have had a lot of what the hell just happened moments since the film script slices and dices all four story lines to death.  Really, read the book then see the movie for the sake of your sanity.
B00466HM28|5.0|Once again Akai does not disappoint!!! I have the Akai SynthStation25, an MPC1000 so i knew i'd have to stick w/more Akai products so i bought this one, nice and small for easy portability, lightweight too, NOT something i would drop though, i will leave more info as i have more time to use it, will DEFINATELY be buying more Akai music equiptment in the future as i continue upgrading.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book because it had me in stitches! I enjoyed reading it from drew 's pov! I hope there is more to come!
B001R0LOES|4.0|This is one of my favorite films, notwithstanding the historical inaccuracies as it gives light to an important event in history.  Having said that, I cringe every time Julia Roberts and Aidan Quinn appear on screen.  With the plethora of highly talented Irish actors, it is unclear to me why Neil Jordan could not convince the studios to not make the mistake of adding subpart talent and bad acting to bring Americans into the theaters.  Liam Neeson and Stephen Rea are so strong that they are able to distract from the scars left by the American cast...but not completely.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I loved her past books.  Did she really write this?  This book is horribly written, story is not true to characters and the end is so absurd and ridiculous! I won't buy another book by ths author. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My mom got this for me and i loved it hopefully you will to please get or not your opinion but i LOVE IT.p.s best$0.00.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I've downloaded this game many times. It's very entertaining and fun to start from the beginning over and over again. It is the 2nd most addicting game next to Candy Crush.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Wow! Have they still got it! I've always been a fan of Led Zeppelin but this solidified it. Plant's voice-the best. Page's guitar-the definition of &#34;shred&#34; (children, watch & learn). JPJ-what an under-rated talent. Bonham-the joy on that man's face playing his father's music-priceless!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|What I really like about this live record, is the generous amount of songs performed from the 1970s, such as \\"Marcella\\", \\"Disney Girls\\" & \\"California\\".  The Band could have just sleepwalked through a tried & tested greatest hits set (in the 1980s Mike Love famously refused to attended the concert rehearsals because he was so used to singing the same songs over & over again).<br />Instead we get 41 tracks spanning most of the BB's career & played with real professionalism & enthusiasm.<br />Obviously Dennis Wilson's unique drumming is sadly missed, as well as Carl Wilson's Vocals & Guitar (something I don't think he's really been given credit for). But you do get the original vocals on \\"Forever\\" & \\"God Only Know\\" with this rest of the band playing live, which is a nice touch. It's a bit of a shame that the BB's couldn't have got Ricky Fataar & Blondie Chaplin to play on a couple of the songs though.<br />The energy levels of the band aren't quite the same as they were in the 60s & 70s, but the concert does has a great momentum to it, & it is really amazes me that you never get fed up listening to these songs, it what ever format there presented.<br />So if this is going to be The Beach Boys swan song (there is talk of a rock n' roll album, but I'll take that with a pitch of salt), this will be more that a good bookend to an extraordinary career.
B0031RS7MW|5.0|I started and couldn't stop, what a wonderful story, I loved the main mysterious character and her adorable daughter. must read
B006K1IIAC|5.0|I did not expect to love this show as much as I do.  I've seen a bit of Holmes over the years, performed by other actors. While I did enjoy the Robert Downey Jr./Jude Law films alot, they didn't grip me as much as this portrayal of the characters has.  The writing is brilliant, the acting extraordinary, and the photography exquisite.  I recommend it to anyone!
1575666286|5.0|with cancer rates one of every two people. everyone should be aware that this is an alternative treatment.  this treatment could have saved my mother's life if we knew about it.  however the medical establishment will not give any credence to this treatment why not?
B005DF2QMC|1.0|After 8-10 hours of play-time, the mechanism died.  It will no longer play at the proper speed. Money down the drain. You get what you pay for and on this tape player, the quality definitely matches the price.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|The phrase &#34;keep on, keeping on&#34; comes to mind with this album.  It has been playing constantly and the songs are cherished in my heart.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My younger cousin was getting bored at a graduation party and started getting into trouble. I handed her this game and she was distracted for the rest of party allowing for us to get it done with no more problems.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was an amazing book it's perfect for 4th grade and up it also is filled with action and adventure
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This was a fascinating production. However, I had to watch it twice to get all the connections.I loved watching it twice! I think it was brillant the way it merged all the differn't eras. I never figured out the symbolism of the birthmark. Was it inherited, or were they rencarnations ?  I think this movie should have been nominated for an Academy Award???
B00008EUMA|5.0|it was more than i expected, nothing compares to the vinyl sound is awesome!!! Five stars now im waiting for Metallica's Master of puppets!!!
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|I love all the music choices; the movie felt both authentic but it also had a flare that made it more modern - very welcome, considering the Gatsby films before it.
B00AES0AZI|5.0|Dean Koontz is a storyteller of the highest caliber, and so it is high praise indeed when I say that, for me, this is his finest piece of work.<br /><br />Watchers has everything you could possibly want in a good read. Government sponsored lab experiments, which succeed in creating the supermutt among dogs, and a fearsome rampaging monster. The murderous creature is cast as the villain of the piece as it leaves a trail of destruction in its wake. But actually, thanks to Koontz fine writing, it is also a creature which we end up pitying. After all, it too is a victim of circumstance.<br /><br />As with many of Koontz books, the two main protagonists are both flawed individuals who, through coming together, seek to find redemption through their actions.<br /><br />There are also government men, and a real 'fruit loop' of an assassin, all of whom are integral to the telling of the story, and what a superb story it is!<br /><br />This is a great read for anyone, but for dog lovers particularly, read Watchers today!
B002DS3982|1.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas, it was cheaply made for the price. One of the cups fell off while using it and could not find it. Called customer service they said sorry you had longer than 3 months so you will have to buy replacement feet for the cane. $9.95 plus shipping etc. Well I guess there's one for the trash. They don't stand behind there merchandise. Will not recommend !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|First of all big fan of Minecraft love it awesome and nothing never goes wrong. Then it's you 1 star  reviewers who it's TOO expensive, well it's not. Reason is pc, Xbox,pocket, edition. Pocket edition is 6.99 because of the higher prices on the other versions. About the multiplayer servers is be sure both devices are connected to the same WiFi and there servers are VISIBLE. Another problem is minecraft vs survivalcraft, minecraft on the other hand is way more popular than some stupid survivalcraft, same thing goes with block story. The controls are not complicated, if you don't understand the  controls play on peaceful and test  the controls until you figure it out. Hopefully this helped some of your problems<br />P.s I'M A KINDLE FIRE USER
B005H9B44A|4.0|The movie played the whole way through with no interruptions! Sound could have been better, but was a great deal - FREE
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|Vikings is a great TV series because it blends fact with enough fiction to make it enjoyable to watch. Sure, it's can be a Game of Thrones clone at times, but it packs enough of its own unique elements to be original too. Like [[ASIN:B008CLI4N4 Game of Thrones: The Complete First Season]], the top-billing star is axed midway through for what looks like budget constraints. This crippled GoT and it may do the same to Vikings. Unlike GoT, the main events revolve around one character who is the central focus of the entire story. Also, Vikings traverses far darker material than GoT. This is surprising, since Vikings was produced for cable TV, which means that it lacks the T&A and intense gore of anything you will find on HBO.<br /><br />The most polarized sub-conflict is Ragnar Lothbrok's thirst for conquest versus the unwavering faith of his Christian slave--a monk kidnapped during a raid. Ragnar is sharp, cunning, and always wears an evil grin while his priest slave is contemplative, weak, and innocent. These two characters seem to clash in their core ideals, even though they develop a close personal relationship (at one point Ragnar invites the monk to have a threesome with his wife). Ragnar's wife obliges, going so far as to show a little thigh to the chaste young friar. The monk declines and gropes his Bible in wanton lust before spitting out 10 Hail Marys and an Our Father in rapid-fire succession.<br /><br />The pilot is weak and the finale is even more of a letdown, but everything in between is stellar. The writers of Vikings did an excellent job as the script is clear, precise, and injects action at just the right points. It can be slow, but it's not convoluted like Robert Jordan's televised slogfest. There are no colliding characters with their own separate plot lines to worry about; this is Ragnar Lothbrok's show. The actor who plays Ragnar is a no-namer, but he seems to possess the leading power to pull off the role with ease, and is one evil looking Norse badass to boot.dass to boot.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was a little concerned of the quality based on the rice. But, WOW!! This bag is impressive. Thanks for making and providing a great bag for a lower cost.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is truly the best book I've ever read.<br /> anyone who loves dogs or racing should read this. This book is a good story with an amazing point of view from a dog who longs to be human and wishes he could say so much to his loving owner who loves him to death and would do anything for him.  There is the perfect amount of conflict,love,and affection in this amazing piece of art. This book truly showed me the relationship between man and dog and how tight the bond is between them. This was a truly inspiring book and I would recommend it for teenagers and adults.
0385535147|5.0|I have read each and every book he has written, love his books. When I finish reading the last on he's written I think when is the next one coming out. I really enjoy his books!

Got the book with a tiny bit of damage to one corner, but not enough to open book and use it. Thanks Amazon for having great companies that have amazing products. Very happy!
B009MCRHH6|1.0|but shame on Amazon, the price dropped over 80% within just a couple days after I purchased. Makes me hesitant to purchase from them again.

B0042AGNBY|5.0|This is Guy Ritchie's magnum opus! Snatch is one of my favorite movies of all time. The way it's shot, casted, soundtrack, humor... It is such a fun ride. Don't forget to turn on the Pikey Subtitles...
B002GHHHL0|5.0|This is not that different from a standard slasher flick in that a small group of people are trapped in one location and picked off one at a time by a killer.  In this case, the killer(s) is a shark(s) made smart to cure Alzheimer's.  The victims (I meant staff) of the outpost, on and under the sea, are pretty standard types.  There's the token hunk (Thomas Jane) with a past that of course gets thrown in his face.  Naturally, there's a mad scientist/amoral cretin in charge (model Saffron Burrows).  Comic relief is offered up by LL Cool J and Michael Rapaport.  Can't get cut off from the world without a dispatcher present (Aida Turturro).  And miscellaneous other bodies and body parts belong to Jacqueline McKenzie and Stellan Skarsgard.  Last but by no means least, the always reliable Samuel L. Jackson shows up as an executive looking out for the financial backers of Aquatica (\\"looks like Alcatraz floats.\\").  The plot involves an opportune storm, three sharks looking to bust out, and just a few people in their way (how they hated to snack and run).  When things go wrong they go wrong all at once.  The body count only seems high because the main cast is so low.  At least they had the time to develop personalities first; we wouldn't care otherwise.  The sharks are suitably tricky.  It's a bit like the Poseidon Adventure at times, Jaws too, but that's fine, I'm a firm believer in more of the same rather than just one of a kind.  That's how genres are made.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|A joy to read. I had a hard time putting it down Patrick Rothfuss spins a tale that takes the imagination on a wonderful ride.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it had a lot of great insights.  It has raised my awareness about habits, and perhaps now I can use some of this knowledge to &#34;remanufacture&#34; some of my own habits.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a fun game I love the girl the most she is so so so so pretty I love this game I am so glad that it was made
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I just can't get enough of this movie. Best sci-fi reincarnation to hit the big screen ever. Chris Pine is brilliant, and Zachary Quinto delivers deadpan like no other.
B006AN78XS|5.0|Romantic movie set in Paris with history to boot. I loved it and the entertainment and history lessons it provided. Definitely a movie to watch over and over again
B004FQX59I|5.0|I have always been concerned as to how JFK was killed and if you run the movie frame by frame there is something in 1 frame which appears as the fatal bullet and it did not come from where we were told it came from.
B00BT0ZDF2|3.0|I REALLY wanted to love this movie.  I love the actors; I love the premise of reincarnation.  But I watch movies to be entertained, not to sit for weeks and ponder about the meaning of life.  So for that reason, I didn't enjoy this movie.  Perhaps it is one of those movies, where if I had read the book I could have filled in the gaps.  However, since I haven't read the book, it really didn't gel for me.  I will consider reading the book and then watch it again, and perhaps then I will be enlightened like the other reviewers.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|John Green has outdone himself. This book has inspired me and has become my favorite book of all time, no joke. The character of Colin is one who I can relate with so easily. I love how you can see into his thoughts, even though his thoughts are not so easily described. Lindsey reminds me so much of myself, how she can create herself in the moment, becoming the bubbly girl to the deep in the west girl to just one of the guys. I could relate how she is just trying to find herself, and it makes me so happy to know that she and Colin and Hassan (by far the best character, who makes me cry with laughter). Even though this book has some topics and some language for older kids about 13 and up, I loved every second. John Green is extremely talented and the best I know of.
1478230096|1.0|Yes, I suppose, the plot summary and the explanation of themes and historical context are valuable, but we're talking about the redaction of a 1400+ page novel to 180 pages - more than 87% of the novel! A person would be better off reading the \\"Classics Illustrated\\" comic book version or the \\"Reader's Digest\\" version (if it exists). Take a pass!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book had my attention until the very end. I didn't expect it to be so abrupt. Good book for anyone who wants to start reading (junior high/high school age). Some language and pictures may be disturbing disturbing to some. But I did like the creativity of this novel.
1932907009|5.0|If you're an aspiring screenwriter like moi you must read it asap. It's an easy read, it has tons of useful info and it's pretty funny too.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Enjoy the game but if you have a kindle fire HD beware, the game misleads swipes fairly often resulting in your untimely demise.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|In my opinion, Howey is a fantastic self publishing author that has a great way with words. I read Maze Runner after this and the writing didn't compare at all with Howey's. It's fast paced, intriguing and non repetitive. Which would be hard in such a contained setting. Can't wait for the third set to come out!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Superb, wonderful and joyful musical voice of Michael Buble' mesmerizes audiences in to the happiness of Christmas blessing and hope.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I have been a Bob Marley fan I would say as much as the next person. I saw part of this documentary on a flight and didn't get to watch the end. I bought the DVD and was so happy to get to see the rest of it. Marley had a very interesting life, and this documentary illustrates that beautifully.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is really sad but ends up happy in the end. I cannot believe the surprise endings! It is great and it gives the book some flavors

B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is exactly the sound source I've been looking for to help me sleep.  Am using on my new Kindle Fire along with Gentle Alarm.  This has great built in sounds (you can modify but I'm too lazy), a nice night display clock (customizable colors and brightness), and an easy to program timer.  The sound loops are not noticeable at ALL on the sounds I've used so far and being a musician I'm picky about dropout.  Lots of new sounds available regularly.  Only thing missing is a way to change the clock font because I hope to use this little app forever and a little variety there would be nice.  For the price this app is awesome!  Never bugged me for a review, either - I am happy to recommend this!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Glad I bought it to watch it many times over.  Enough action for the guys and enough story for the chics.
B009GED3HS|5.0|....but then again im in love with this show, i bought every season and to me the whole series deserves 5 stars. unless season 9 totally tanks but i doubt thatll happen. once season 9 comes out im totally buying that one too.<br /><br />Id reccommend this season and the whole series to anyone
159463176X|4.0|Khaled does not disappoint with his latest, And the Mountains Echoed.<br /><br />In short, does it live up to Kite Runner, no.<br />Is it a worthwhile read and a worthy follow-up book, yes.<br /><br />I personally found splendid suns a bit hard to swallow emotionally, perhaps the focus on mother-daughter relationships was too close for comfort.<br /><br />And the Mountains Echoed focuses instead on siblings, Abdullah and Pari, as it moves from East to West and shifts geographies.<br />The siblings are raised in separate worlds which setup the opening themes and discoveries for the remainder of the book.<br /><br />The characters as always for Khaled's novels are beautifully described and by the end of the book you have grown to care.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book.  It was an easy read, at least I found it easier to digest then it's predecessors.<br />There is a bit of added emotional drama (pulls at heart strings) but what Khaled book does not?<br /><br />I felt like there is less focus on regional conflict and more focus on individual relationships then previous works.  Personally I enjoyed that aspect.<br /><br />And the Mounts Echoed starts out fairly strong and ended well enough for my taste.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|best series ever, i have all of the seasons and id reccommend the whole series to anyone. actually i have already.
B005FITIGO|4.0|Excellent in every respect and extremely impressive coming from a first time director. Having seen and read everything I could on the GFC this film captures the essence of 'financial players'.

B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|I have read every Lee Childs books, some of them I have read more then once and this book that they made a movie of I have read three times. This movie does copy some of what the book says but does not have all the characters that are in the book inside the movie.<br />The spot where he killed everyone was good but the place where the people died was completely wrong<br />they also forgot about the other military officer that jack reacher knows that comes in to help put the gentlemen away.<br />the police chase in the car im sorry was not in the book, jack reacher walks most places, moves to another hotel before the girl is found dead in which she was hit once and was not leaving to go out to meet someone, they went to her house woke her up and told her to get dressed and killed her with one punch under the freeway and didn't have to suffocate her.<br />At the firing range Jack Reacher made the shot with one shot not three shots.<br />The last seen is played in a construction site with a gun but in the book jack reacher has to approach a house as cold because of thermal imaging cameras, he uses a knife to kill his enemies.<br />I feel like I wasted my money buying this movie, the book is ten times better.
B000WDQMWU|5.0|best series ever, i have all of the seasons and id reccommend the whole series to anyone. actually i have already.

B0064SHI9I|5.0|I chose this app based on other reviews and it couldn't be easier to use. It does what it claims, what more need be said. I highly recommended this app.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|My husband just loves to watch and listen to these women and this one has not disappointed him. It's great.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I too used to read the Sookie books in one sitting.  I was also aware they may not have been the most well-written books, but they were addictive and the characters were interesting and I couldn't wait for the next one.  But this was just the ultimate let-down.  I don't want to repeat what all the other negative reviews are saying as they pretty much hit the nail on the head and said it better than I could so I'll just say I struggled to finish it, I hated most of the characters and what should have been a fantastic climax turned out to be nothing but proof of what a truly awful writer Charlaine is.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|OMG and Abrams has the gall to call this Star Trek?  Star Trek had morals, humans were out of their infancy and were exploring the galaxy. ENTER JJ ABRAMS.<br />Last movie was good.  Even though they destroyed Vulcan.  As a fan I could see the crew and the Federation overcoming alot of hurdles to make a brighter future. Nope. Not in Abrams playbook. He brings in the worst kind of campy sci/fi, leeching off of Wrath of Khan, and effectively changing fundemental character traits in the cast. (You know 'new' timeline...) Spock is changed from a loyal commander who was willing to take chances (Anyone remember the Menagerie?) to a whining, disloyal crybaby. Kirk at least makes sense. Still the rebel, but without the discipline of the Academy. The new Scotty, is so freaking irritating, I'd give alot to boot him into the warp core. Mccoy is decent. And this romance between Spock and Uhura should never have been written in the first place.  Now it is getting to be really annoying. Abrams is changing basic character traits that shouldn't have been affected. He is manipulating Star Trek, with nods to TOS, to appease the fans,to get new interest. The Universe is not even recognizable as Star Trek except for the names. He is taking too many liberties just for the almighty dollar. If Roddenberry had still been alive, he would never have allowed this movie. And in my opinion, Abram needs to get back ontrack, or shove off.

B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk's fourth studio album proper has got to be the most anticipated album so far this year. It far exceeds the hype; Disco, Funk, and Rock with a human feel. Most of the instrumentation is real with Nile Rodgers scratchy funky guitars, and other guests like Pharrell, Julian Casablancas, Paul Williams, Todd Edwards, Panda Bear, and the legendary Giorgio Moroder who appears on \\"Giorgio By Moroder\\" narrating his earlier career in Germany (and particularly his work on Donna Summer's ground breaking \\"I Remember Yesterday\\" album\\" which incorporated sounds from the 50s through to the futuristic \\"I Feel Love\\") to a groovy backdrop before beautifully morphing into ornate Disco reminiscent of Cerrone.<br /><br />The sound is far off from what everyone from David Guetta, Calvin Harris, or Skrillex are churning out. \\"Give Life Back To Music\\" is the opening cut and does what the title says, a robotic voice intoning against a groovy Chic-style retro groove, flying in the face of the anonymous mechanical Electronic Dance music currently cluttering up the charts.<br /><br />\\"Instant Crush\\" features Julian Casablancas dreamy elfin vocals against a chugging rock-ish arrangement. Lose Yourself To Dance\\" takes the tempo down a wee bit and features the vocals of Pharrell, who also sings on the breezy smash hit lead-single \\"Get Lucky\\". \\"Fragments Of Time\\" features Todd Edwards singing to a sunny 70s/80s Pop backdrop, while \\"Doin' It Right\\" is a spare robotic ballad featuring Panda Bear.<br /><br />\\"Within\\" is a stunning piano ballad with a winsome robotic voice singing \\"There are so many things that I don't understand...\\" which recalls Radiohead. \\"Touch\\" is an ambitious tempo-shifting piece with groovy bass, darting horns, and the vocals of Paul Williams, a maelstrom of instrumentation and a masterpiece! \\"Beyond\\" is an incredibly beautiful mid tempo trippy groove. Similar is \\"The Game Of Love\\".<br /><br />For those that enjoy their instrumental pieces, there's the swirling \\"Motherboard\\" (with interesting percussion patterns), and \\"Contact\\" (which starts off with the real-life recording of astronaut Eugene Cernan's narration of a UFO sighting).<br /><br />Daft Punk take you on an exhilarating ride, one of the best you'll get this year.oard\\" (with interesting percussion patterns), and \\"Contact\\" (which starts off with the real-life recording of astronaut Eugene Cernan's narration of a UFO sighting).<br /><br />Daft Punk take you on an exhilarating ride, one of the best you'll get this year.

0451457994|5.0|\\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" begins with a man-ape named Moon-Watcher millions of years ago and leaps forward through time to the present day when Dr. Heywood Floyd is sent to the Moon owing to a secretive and rumored \\"disease\\" that is believed to have inflicted the \\"American\\" portion of the colony; (the other end occupied by the Soviet Union). From there we move ahead a few years to doctors David Bowman and Francis Poole who are on a mission to reach Saturn.<br /><br />What they and we as the reader discover transcends theirs and our everyday lives, Jupiter and its swirling clouds and Saturn and its particle rings and the inevitable problems with Hal (the A.I. goes haywire theme has become so clich&eacute; vis a vis Terminator, Matrix and countless other stories. But can it all be traced back to Mr. Clarke and this story from 1968? Is Mr. Clarke the one to blame for Matrix Revolutions and Terminator III and IV?), the tumbling adventure through the Star Gate, the \\"star child\\" and the return to Earth.<br /><br />The theme that struck most for me was that of evolution:<br /><br />\\"There were other thinkers, Bowman also found, who held even more exotic views. They did not believe that really advanced beings would possess organic bodies at all. Sooner or later, as their scientific knowledge progressed, they would get rid of the fragile, disease-and-accident-prone homes that Nature had given them, and which doomed them to inevitable death. They would replace their natural bodies as they wore out-- or perhaps even before that-- by constructions of metal and plastic, and would thus achieve immortality. The brain might linger for a little while as the last remnant of the organic body, directing its mechanical limbs and observing the universe through its electronic senses-- senses far finer and subtler than those that blind evolution could ever develop.<br /><br />\\"Even on Earth, the first steps in this direction had been taken. There were millions of men, doomed in earlier ages, who now lived active and happy lives thanks to artificial limbs, kidneys, lungs, and hearts. To this process there could be only one conclusion-- however far off it might be. And eventually even the brain might go. As the seat of consciousness, it was not essential; the development of electronic intelligence had proved that. The conflict between mind and machine might be resolved at last in the eternal truce of complete symbiosis...<br /><br />\\"But was even this the end? A few mystically inclined biologists went still further. They speculated, taking their cues from the beliefs of many religions, that mind would eventually free itself from matter. The robot body, like the flesh-and-blood one, would be no more than a stepping-stone to something which, long ago, men had called \\"spirit.\\" And if there was anything beyond that, its name could only be God.\\"<br /><br />The bottom line: Although \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" is an easy read, there isn't enough time in a review such as this to delve into its varied and important messages and meanings. Mr. Clarke's admonition seems to be that humans are evolving, improving as we had millions of years ago to this day and the future will likely be more of the same (advancement and war), foreshadowed with this nugget of repetitive prose (from the Moon-Watcher to the Star Child):<br /><br />\\"Then he waited, marshaling his thoughts and brooding over his still untested powers. For though he was master of the world, he was not quite sure what to do next.<br /><br />\\"But he would think of something.\\"<br /><br />-Raeden Zenow lived active and happy lives thanks to artificial limbs, kidneys, lungs, and hearts.

193700788X|1.0|The story doesn't feel complete after reading this book. I was quite sad with Sookie ending up with Sam after so many books following her and Eric, a reader becomes very invested in that relationship. There seemed to be no real \\"end\\" to Sookie and Eric's relationship. Overall, the plot of this book wasn't even all the great. Such a bad end, to such a great series.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This is a great movie to watch with a big tub of popcorn.  The movies was very entertaining. All of the actors performed well with their characters.

B00BY8DIT2|2.0|I was hoping this second outing from this talented duo would be a step closer to my preferred music style from Joe B....blues-rock...what HE DOES BEST...but alas, this is even further from that, so I'm passing on it. If you like an album full of big, blaring brass sections drowning out the guitar aside from some phoned-in solos by Joe B., then this album is for you. If you love power guitar-driven songs with Joe tearing it up (and if you are narrow-minded like me), you might want to stick to Joe's solo CD's. Beth is a great singer, and this material proves it, but the style of music is just way off base for me. Big band jazz?? Come on! What happened to ROCK? Some of the tunes somewhat have a rock edge, but not enough to sound like what I hoping this album was going to be. The only song that was music to my ears (pun intended) was Can't Let You Go...great slide guitar from Joe on that one. I'll just stick to Joe's solo stuff, thank you...<br /><br />For all of the fans of this album who have suddenly discovered a love for Big Band Jazz, may I recommend Benny Goodman, whose band even featured an electric guitar soloist, the pioneering Charlie Christian. Goodman's recordings are obviously quite old and do not sport the pristine sound of modern albums, but he is the REAL DEAL...check him out...<br /><br />OK, let the onslaught of unhelpful votes as punishment for not liking this commence...lay it on me! LOL<br /><br />5/21/13...0 for 6, alright, good start...let's make this the most \\"unhelpful\\" review in the history of Amazon! I'm gunning for 0 for 50 by the end of the week! LOL
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Amazing build, amazon thank you for making this for us with such a great price that I even bought next day shipping and STILL cheaper then any at camera stores or even on here!! Ill tell you what, this bag is worth $150!<br />It's so user friendly and you can move around all the compartments to make it fit for exactly what you need it to! The tripod strap on the side is brilliant and works flawlessly when rushing to a shoot, or if you don't have a bag you know how crappy it is to carry your equipment to a shoot or even around! This makes you look very more professionally! I've fit my Nikon, 4 lens and 4 flashes along with everything else like my shutter release, tripod, cleaning kit, mini reflector, adapters and much more! Again, thank you Amazon!!
0399157565|1.0|Over the years, I have enjoyed many of author's Scarpeta novels.  But ever since the site location in Virginia was changed, I have lost interest in her books.  I was lost until close to halfway thru the book.  Do not recommend this book.
B0083IQFD2|5.0|This EP is absolutely slaying my entire whole being. Azealia Banks is not a rapper this woman is an ARTIST!! Her way with words blows my mind and I cannot stop listening to it. It's a must buy!!

B008S8PPPG|5.0|When I bought this album I hadn't heard but only Devotion and Wildest Moments. I was soo happy to listen to the rest of the album and hear cool and airy vocals and it sounded so great I couldn't get enough. 'Sweet Talk' and 'Running' grew to be my favorites. This album is a must buy!!!!
034580404X|5.0|Love the book, Love the Series, Love the Author! The only warning I would offer is a caution to those that may have a sensitivity to explicit sex.  I certainly hope the author takes the series further and expands on the lives of Anastasia & Christian even further!

B00BAYLQI0|4.0|THE IMPOSSIBLE takes us deep into a true nightmare that few have experienced or survived. It is an unnervingly realistic account of one family's dispair and impossible survival despite all odds.<br />English/Scottish couple Maria and Henry (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) and their three young boys have made the fateful decision to holiday in beautiful Thailand over Christmas. No one could have been prepared for the horrors of a tsunami turning miles of lush, beautiful countryside into a disaster zone.<br /><br />The amazing realism of the tsunami and the sense of what it is like to be pulled under the water as tons of debris swirl around you is made very clear in THE IMPOSSIBLE. The realism pulls you into its own tsunami as seconds seem to last for hours. The constant movement of debris and of human beings in the churning violent water can be too much to bear at times but this is realism at its finest.<br /><br />Here is one family's story. It's just one of countless stories that may never be told. It's even more a story of a mother and her son as they fight for survival and eventually hope to be reunited with the rest of their family. This is the true story of Maria Belon and her family. Ironically, the real Spanish family is now English/Scottish and their names (except for Maria's) are now anglicized.<br /><br />There are amazing performances by newcomer Tom Holland (as oldest son Lucas)and Watts and McGregor. Watts brings us the pain and despair of the real Maria in her desperate struggle for life and to reunite her family. It's an amazing journey into the love and faith of one family. THE IMPOSSIBLE focuses on one family and there has been some criticism of that fact, yet their story is just one piece of an enormous puzzle. Maria Belon seriously promoted her story and survival so nothing is being given away by knowing this is a story of one family's survival.<br /><br />There is a human interest story here of how people from different nationalities come togetherin a tragedy. There is only a brief interaction with an uninjured couple upset about the inconvenience of not being able to quickly book a flight home. How many people reacted that way? It's a subject for another film.<br /><br />The scenes of the tsunami are beyond incredible and the depiction of compassion and kindess are heartwarming. A mother's love for her son is so clear through Watts's performance and the sadness of a young boy suddenly having to become a man is tough. THE IMPOSSIBLE slows down as Watts is in the hospital but then we pick up Henry's story with the two younger sons. Neither half of the separated family knows the fate of the other. No family should ever be in that situation.<br /><br />THE IMPOSSIBLE will upset and unnerve some simply because of its realistic depiction of the world's biggest recorded tsunami. Watts and McGregor prove they are world class actors and young Tom Holland is an amazing newcomer with all the emotions of a boy forced into manhood. Overall, THE IMPOSSIBLE is an amazing film.
B005GU8ILW|5.0|The vinyl is awesome! I l have a vinyl records collection and needed this one. I love Ed Sheeran. :D
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|this is an awesome looking flyer that would takes years on end to aquire all the suits on your own and the credits it takes to own everything is $100! How is this justified? On a game perspective though it looks great and out of the 20 or so suits you can get like 5... maybe just by getting points but it wont be quick. lol

0307990850|5.0|Jack Reacher is awesome - the books always have a surprise ending that I enjoy.  Although I believe the frst books did have a little more action.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|The book was really fantastic and imaginative. I had previously watched Hayao Miyazaki's rendition of her book before actually reading it, and it was a pleasure to delve in to each character more. Sophie and Howl's budding relationship is really charming and slow to progress. What I really enjoyed was that the characters never lost a sense of themselves. They stayed true to their original tendencies while growing and learning at the same time. True, the book and movie vary quite drastically, but the book was enjoyable on a different level!<br /><br />5 Stars!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is an amazing app. Very simple to use, and it works great! Easy to read also. Very well done!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|After hearing so many friends rave about the movie, Silver Linings Playbook, I decided to read the book before watching the DVD.  Written by Matthew Quick, I can't say enough good things about this novel.  It was funny, it was sad, it was moving, it was uplifting and it was eye-opening.  As since it takes place very close to where I live, I thoroughly enjoyed all the local references.  Author Quick also shines a much-needed light on bi-polar disorder, although it is never identified as such in the book.<br /><br />Silver Linings Playbook opens as Pat Peoples is checked out of a mental health facility in Baltimore by his mom, who takes him to his childhood home in Collingswood, NJ.  Pat had a violent incident four years prior, and that episode caused him to lose his wife, his house, his car, his career, and his freedom.  He has little memory of that event, but he's determined to set out on a path of self-improvement to win back his beloved Nikki.  Pat believes that his life is a movie and he is always searching for the silver lining.  He wants a happy ending.  Pat's mom is a kind and nurturing soul, but his father is aloof and most incommunicative.  But the entire family rallies around the Eagles during the NFL season.  This is the glue that starts to bond father and son, although it is a tenuous bond, at best.  Pat's best friend Ronnie has a recently widowed sister-in-law, Tiffany, who is another wounded soul in therapy and taking meds.  Pat and Tiffany are fixed up, but without much success at first.  But Tiffany offers Pat a deal--if he will join her in a dance competition, she will help him with something very important.  One of her demands is that Pat have nothing to do with football until the competition is over.  How this plays out is quite funny at times, but also moving and sad.<br /><br />Silver Linings Playbook is told in the first person, and Pat Peoples lets the reader in on his tortured world.  In comparing himself to his brother Jake, Jake \\"is not trying to improve his life at all, because he doesn't ever feel the war that goes on in my chest every single (f) day--the chemical explosives that light up my skull like the Fourth of July and the awful needs and impulses and...\\"  But Pat also has a keen insight when dealing with Tiffany.  \\"She looks sad.  She looks angry.  She looks different from everyone else I know--she cannot put on that happy face others wear when they know they are being watched.  She doesn't put on a face for me, which makes me trust her somehow.\\"<br /><br />Some of the funniest scenes involve the 2008 Eagles' season.  Quick shows it all including the rabid fans who hate the Redskins, the Giants, and especially, the Dallas Cowboys.  We see the superstitions, the rituals, the elaborate tailgate parties (the green football carnival), the fights, the wins, the losses, and the injured players.  There are also high hopes and dashed dreams--as with most professional sports teams.  But through it all, Pat learns a true lesson about silver linings and sometimes the happy ending you end up with is not the one you envisioned for yourself.ng to improve his life at all, because he doesn't ever feel the war that goes on in my chest every single (f) day--the chemical explosives that light up my skull like the Fourth of July and the awful needs and impulses and...\\"  But Pat also has a keen insight when dealing with Tiffany.  \\"She looks sad.

B009R9WAZ8|5.0|I've been a Rihanna fan since her first album and I've got to say that this album kicks (well, you know).  I can't seem to stop listening to it.  It sounds amazing in my car which is where I listen to music the most.  If you haven't heard it on a good system - you're missing out!.  I love the island beats, the flow and rhythm and everything about it!  You can really feel the emotion she put into this album, or at least I can.  Pour it Out, Loveeeee Song and Numb are my favorites!<br /><br />All in all, spectacular album and I'd recommend it to anyone - even the hater's.<br /><br />Shipping was fast!  Two days early!  Excellent service Amazon!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I can count on one hand the network TV shows that have grabbed and held my attention over a sustained period of time, &#34;Twin Peaks&#34;, &#34;The X-Files&#34;, &#34;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#34; and now &#34;Hannibal&#34;. Yes, it's gory and yes, I wish it were on HBO or Showtime so the episodes could be longer and the storylines a bit more developed but the gorgeous production design and strong acting, particularly from the two leads, more than make up for any deficits. The show is unflinching and fascinating and as an avid Thomas Harris fan, true to the characters of Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter, though, I will admit, it took me a bit to get used to Mads Mikkelson's accent. I can't wait to see how the relationship between all the lead characters will progress and am praying the series in renewed.<br /><br />For those watching on NBC, I recommend watching on Amazon instead. The episodes flow so much better without commercials, even if you fast forward on a DVR, it's better to watch totally uninterrupted to really immerse yourself in the atmospheric creepiness!
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Love this edition. Who doesn't love bridget jones? Its full of laughs.<br />Renee zellweger really melts your heart with this character.
