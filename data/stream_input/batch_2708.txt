B008133MDK|5.0|Best and most modern presentation. Highly recommend. Easy to access andfidelity of viewing is great. Each show stands on its own.
0061780308|5.0|I am not one for finishing a book in one sitting but The Art of Racing in The Rain had me at hello.  The author paints a vivid image of what the human spirit can overcome when faced with tremendous adversity and delivers a heartwarming account from none other than man's best friend.  The emotional impact of the book is significant and will take you from tears to laughter and back again within the span of a few pages.<br /><br />A must read.  Highly recommend.
B005LAII12|4.0|Fun, crazy movie.  All the adults in our family thought it super funny, very entertaining.  This is definitely not for children, I'd say no one under 18.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Loved it...read all the books as well.  I have recommended it to several people.  I was pleased the TV series<br />Followed the books fairly well with a few deviations.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed watching this on my computer in HD or on my Ipad. I can't wait for season 4.<br /><br />Great Show
B006FE83UE|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen.  Gregory Peck is amazing in this performance.  All the actors were exceptional!  The world is a better place with this movie in it.  Even 50+ years old,  this movie stands up to anything coming out today.
B0051OZ564|5.0|This is a great movie.  Not what you expect as far as plot line - Interesting with several surprising twists.  Excellent imagery and production.
B0049MAXQG|4.0|This movie is still good but not as scary as when I was a kid seeing it. Any fan of horror movies should have this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The early levels are great for my kids and higher levels great for me! Very addictive and hard to put down... love this app :)
0345803485|5.0|how do you describe a book that goes that extra mile to hold your interest. Once you get into the story, the sexual descriptions just are there.
0345803507|5.0|Loved how the story flowed and the great ending. Would recommend this book to friends and family. Could not understand the uproar thar was given when it was first released. Adults have rights and should be able to choose their reading material. I was not offended by any part of the trilogy,
0345803493|5.0|My rating is based on the assumption that as an adult I can pick and choose what I read and not be influenced by media coverage. A well written story that keeps your interest and you just cannot put it down, as the story line is great,
B0032JTV74|5.0|I love Glee even more after watching it. Loved the extras. Can't wait to get season 2! And all the others!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My nephew and I had fun playing this he enjoyed this a whole lot I couldn't get him to stop playing he kept asking for one more try. I would recommend this game for any age group.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is hard yet fun. You have to figure out the puzzle or you do not pass it. It was fun to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awsome game keeps me entertained for a long time an  it is always changing so you don't to use to it
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is so addictive I play it all day and night or no joke I would buy stuff but I'm broke and don't have lots of money
0425263924|5.0|I read this so fast that I started to read it again. Cannot wait for Captivated by You! Excellent read!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is very enjoyable and challenges your hand and eye coordination. I would recommend this game too any of my friends
B0064QNS62|2.0|This game needs some definite upgrades. The game reminds me of some of the Atari game s of yesterday. Too bad.
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|Perform s well and starts too become  redundant after about ten minutes of play. Needs more bells and whistles too keep my attention.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. The game allows for good eye coordination. Really was enjoyable too play with the granddaughter.
B0035JRVR8|4.0|This movie is a CLASSIC! Audrey Hepburn is once again at her best. I recommend this movie for people who love<br />Classic Movies. Great Delivery, Great Condition!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I thought Lincoln was excellent and would like to see more movies that are good stories about our history. I watched it twice and will watch it again. I felt like I was there.Daniel day lewis was great. Tell steven Spelberg he should do more..I thank the movie industry  when they make such good movies........
B0013TPV0Q|1.0|Heard this books was very funny. Not so - lots of whining about family, friends, neighbors. Read half and gave it up.
B005DROHGS|5.0|**Lego delisted listed this set in December of 2012. Prices have now risen well above MSRP. See my Amazon guide to Lego trains (click through my name) to see what is currently available and what trains are coming in 2013.**<br /><br />I am the nut-job parent that you'll see in some of the other train reviews. I grew up with Lego and returned to it when I had kids. Obviously I am terribly partial to Lego (ignore my star rating), but I'll give you the best review I can so that you can make the decision that is right for your kids. I do not receive free sets or compensation for my Lego reviews. This set began trickling into U.S. stores in early July, 2011.<br /><br />A tidy and nicely designed set, 3677 includes a heavy switching engine (similar to a Deutsche Bundesbahn Class 290 diesel locomotive), a small green and white hazardous waste boxcar (with a pallet of lime green barrels), tipping ballast car, and maintenance-of-way (MOW) flatcar (which has a small cab, MOW truck, small crane and pallet). The MOW truck has flip-down rail wheels. There is also a trackside conveyor belt loader for the ballast, a trackside hopper, and four mini-figures.<br /><br />The set includes all the necessary Power Function parts (i.e., it is a remotely controlled, motorized train) and requires only batteries. The red battery box (a new color for this part) holds six AAA batteries and sits inside the engine. Lego also included the gray battery cover as a spare. If you don't like changing out AAAs, you can opt for the more expensive rechargeable lithium-ion battery and DC charger available directly from Lego. The lithium-ion battery has a gray cover, but if you are handy you can swap the covers using a small screwdriver. The set includes 16 pieces of curved track, 8 pieces of straight track, and 16 pieces of flex track (enough for an oval).<br /><br />This set sits between 7938 and 7939 in price, but may have the most playability of the three. I find that kids love all the trains and naturally expand them with their own bricks and mini-figures, but this set has a bit more going on than the other two. While 7939 gives you two switches and a crane, with 3677's maintenance car, ballast car/loader, and hazardous waste car, there are more plot lines available (inevitably kids will stage a crash regardless of the train you buy).<br /><br />I like the engine design; it is the latest in a long line of Lego switching engines, the most recent being #4512 from 2003, and one of the most classic being #7760 from 1980. This new engine is very long and has a lift-off top to access the cab. The louvered doors on the side open to reveal engine controls (a sticker). My favorite part of the set is the brown tipper wagon. The green and white boxcar is merely okay. I don't like how the double doors overhang the end when they are open; a single door would have been fine. As for the MOW flatcar, I would have preferred a car that was a piece of MOW machinery (e.g. a ballast spreader) or carried something other than a truck (perhaps a flatcar full of rails). The MOW flatcar has a small cab with a hinged roof.<br /><br />I do recommend that you purchase #7936, Level Crossing, which has another Maintenance of Way vehicle that ties-in perfectly with 3677.<br /><br />Not many stores routinely carry Lego trains and even fewer have them built for you to view. I recommend going to Youtube and doing a search for \\"Lego 3677 brickshopholland\\" so that you can get a better feel for this set. If you want to get a complete overview of what Lego offers for trains, you can go to the Lego site (go to the \\"Shop\\" and organize by \\"theme\\") or you can click on my name, go to my Amazon page, choose the \\"Guides\\" tab, and then choose \\"Get a Lego Train.\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book fulfilled my requirements for an entertaining, thought-provoking journey into a fictional (possibly realistic) world where humans are fighting for survival, not only against their environment, but against each other as well. Character development is fantastic. The reader experiences the emotions and thoughts of each of these people as they discover both wonderful new truths and horrific realizations about their perceptions of the world in which they live. Writing is more comparable to Stephen King than any other book I have read. Exciting, clever and well-written. Can't put it down!
B00AOVXOQW|5.0|One of the gifts for my son's second birthday. The locomotive has decent power and acceptable train battery life. It can pull or push a couple-three cars, even up a little hill. It's cute and well-made. The little freight cars, however, are truly adorable: the cement mixer turns as it goes, and the little coal car rocks from side to side.<br /><br />Fits our Melissa and Doug railroad, the locomotive and the car can also be mixed and matched with other trains--Maxim, M&D, and Thomas.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|An exiting movie and made even more exciting by the fact that it was based on real life events.<br />Ken<br />Webmaster<br />About Facts Net
0679805273|5.0|I don't remember when I first discovered &#34;Oh, the Places You'll Go!&#34;.  I'm 73 and have given this book to dozens of<br />friends and relatives for all different occasions.  I also keep a copy for myself to read every once in a while.  I am an avid reader, have owned thousands of books, and can say overall, this is my favorite. Its message is concise and easily understood by all ages of readers.  It tells us the truth that life will not always be easy, but we should keep trying and<br />enjoy and learn by all the places we'll go along the way.  What a lesson for us all!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is great but they should fix up play on relams.no mater what it is great avertit passer &agrave; se f ch d&eacute;chu sfr fichu
B0036UO56G|4.0|This movie brings back my past and I have been trying to find a copy of it. And then I joined Amazon Prime and there it was.  Thank you loved it and will watch it many times.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Got hooked on Netflix - supper well done classic from Masterpiece Theater. My husband joined me in this adventure and we couldn't get over the set and costume designs.  Super cast, well acted and fun.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Received on release day (@7pm- but still same day) new and sealed with everything described but when u ship could u pack a little better its a legacy collection with a 100 page artbook that they won't sell indv. Just because of the extremely light packaging I had ruff marks and edges on my limited edition book, that's a little discouraging. But all and all ok.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|Okay, stop and take a second. If you're reading this, then obviously you've read other reviews as well. Good. THIS GAME IS TOO HARD, PERIOD. Okay? I read the other reviews, good and bad. I even tried for the mostly good. I downloaded it. I played it. I got frustrated. I shelved it for weeks. I went back and played it again and again and again. I almost threw my phone across the breakroom. You know what would give this game hope? Levels. Let us work up to pulling out hair out. Don't toss us in from the beginning, its mean. Its too hard, too random, too quickly. Build up to it or something.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Although I have only used this app a couple of times, I like it. It's very easy to use, has lots of different features. Frames, stickers, speech bubbles, color effects all kinds of stuff too short your pics with.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not usually a big science-fiction reader, but this book is an exeption. I'm ten, and thought the book was a bit sad, and didn't really like Enders fights, and the ending, because they were both kind of sad. I would reccomend this book for ages tweve and up. YOU  MUST  READ  THIS  BOOK!!!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Ryan murphy is a genious! This show is scary, sexy, captivating! Amazing story line! Watch the pilot you'll be hooked.
B00004NRWH|3.0|I wanted to get all of 'Nickelback's' albums,(so far) and I believe I've done that. However, this album seemed different than the rest. It was ok, just seemed less 'inspired' than the other ones I've heard. Someone did tell me that this was their newest album, so I think i'll give it some time. I REALLY like 'Nickelback', and have found that giving some of their songs time to &#34;grow on you&#34; works quite well.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|My 7 year old adores this movie and it's easy for me to watch it with him. Its action packed and has a good story.
0307719219|4.0|The more laws and the more encroachment into activities left to private sector, the more danger governments introduce to their constituency.
0739366408|5.0|The entire book went so fast, hard to believe it was six hours. Best book on cd ive ever listened to.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I like this game. The problem I have is that it's a money-pit! The game should be more flexible about what they charge for. I don't believe the &#34;lives&#34; should EVER have to be purchased. I put about $6 into this but probably not any more. You might as well go to the casino at least there would be more excitement. Game needs to be reworked so it doesn't have a charge for EVERYTHING.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app love it play it when ever I can! I love how u can keep upgrading it and how it is easier to get stuff!
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's ok but I'm  really Finding it hard to understand but that might be just me it doesn't take much for me to get confused
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Instructions were ok I don't see what everyone is whining about. Great game for free but wouldn't pay $ for it.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Loved this book! A tale of two cities without hope of resurrection or redemption. We've swept the aristocracy aside only to find a banal acceptance of a social order that still leaves the youngest and weakest vulnerable to abuse and neglect. A brilliant comedic tragedy masking a razored grit lit. I admit that I started with Harry Potter expectations, making the first chapter difficult. Before the tears dry, start reading this book again. You will appreciate the writing even more.
0783230079|5.0|I haven't watched this movie in over a decade and I am so glad that I have seen it again. It is what a good family movie should be. Robert Downey Jr. is a fantastic actor. The way he portrays each character's personality when they jump in his body is very funny. This movie has comedy, a deep message, and the plot is magical and makes sense. Every actor did a good job in this movie and we are even treated to a performance by the great B.B.King. So Awesome! You should definitely see this movie.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|Doesn't really do anything, but it is fun to use and the grandkids like it. It is free, so it is worth a shot.
1591845556|5.0|I almost never write reviews since I consider it a form of unpaid advertising. I made the exception in this case because I believe this is a very worthwhile book. I refer to it often and use it now in my daily practice as I'm learning guitar. It has made a marked difference.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I found this a highly accessible and entertaining introduction to the psychology of habits. It is a book every person can relate to. I would recommend this read as a stimulating exercise for those minds who are interested in re evaluating their conception of habit.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Whew!  I am back in business with my Kindle--I did not realize how much wear I put on it and I got the cord really quickly, which was great!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Touching....only a mother could love this story!!!! Resonates with every Mom as we develop new relationships with our adult children/offspring. I cried and laughed!
B006ZAZ31U|1.0|The quality of writing is that of a high schooler. I appreciate what the SEALS have done for our country but let's leave the narrative to the professionals. In the interest of disclosure I could not finish the book.<br /><br />Recommend Hillanbrand's 'Unbroken' if you are looking for a good read in the military non-fiction genre.
B001F12J0C|5.0|If you don't like this trilogy, there is something wrong with your brain.  Get Bourne again as soon as you are able, your soul will thank you.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|A fascinating tale of a very interesting time in America's history. Well developed characters and eventful enough to draw the reader in to the story line. Found the conclusion hopeful and satisfying.
B008602KQI|5.0|great movie, comes very close to the book. I look forward to the next movie that will follow hopefully soon.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is just fun tome and my younger siblings they love to build the houses and get so excited when a new pony comes to the town :D is a great app for you if you baby sit or have younger siblings
B008XNZMOU|4.0|If you like Taylor Swift's Music you should not be disappointed, but it is evident that she is merging to the Pop side of music.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is where I go throughout the day for weather updates. I can also view the latest water temperature and tide information.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This show is very interesting.  The two leading actors make it seem as if they were created to play these characters.  Superb acting and clever writing give this series a five-star rating.
1451626088|5.0|great read, a must read by Philippa Gregory.  will read more of her books brings history to life from a womans point of view
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Wonderful characters, with an uplifting message! Judi Dench is awesome, yet again. An example of age being a state of mind.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Heartwarming love. Unconditional love. Great story with real emotion, this book felt personable. Made me love it!! Look forward to more.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Bought Season 1 and began watching it with my wife and two kids (ages 12 and 8) and we are all hooked and continue to watch 1 or 2 episodes every night (or almost every night).  Very interesting storyline and great characters!  Highly Recommend!!
B0031RS2HC|5.0|If you've never read the series before, give it a try. You will be hooked by Jack Reacher, a modern-day seamless composite of Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Marlowe Chandler and James Bond with all the sex but none of the dressy high-society stuff. But there is a further dimension - the hero's background as a military detective. The author has done his research and brings to life for the civilian reader a very different perspective of world. The novel has been criticized for the far-fetched coincidences. Actually, all thrillers tend to be far fetched when dissected in the cold light of day. What matters is that the author can lull you into a willing suspension of disbelief while you are reading. I have since bought a lot of Reacher books and this one is still among my favourites.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|This guy is a little small but he's well-made and incredibly detailed. Purchased him as a gift for a little boy that's t-rex crazy and he loved it! I

B00AESN8XY|4.0|it is a fun game but it is sad that you are trying to kill all of earth. and plus the fact that the secret is to put out all of the weak ones ant then the killer ones
B008N1V11U|4.0|Grrrrrrrrrreeeeeeaaaaaaattttttttt game that alot of fun u will get lost in playing it by the time u look up hours has past bye.......
B00280LYIC|5.0|I struggle with first person writers a lot of the time. Some books take you too deeply into the character's psyche and others don't give you enough. I'd say Rick Riordan gave the audience just enough with his development of Percy Jackson, demi-god. Percy is a mischievous, personable character from the very beginning. He sticks his neck out to defend others which immediately places him in the hero category which, duh, only makes sense since he is a demi-god and they're sort of known as heroes.<br /><br />In this first book of Riordan's series, the reader follows Percy through his realization that he is a demi-god, to his training at Camp Half-Blood and then through his quest to recover the master bolt that has been stolen from his Uncle Zeus. The adventure is a blast from start to finish. Riordan incorporates classic mythological characters into the modern setting, and he does it flawlessly. Because the book is from Percy's perspective, his quirky sense of humor permeates every word, making Percy's discoveries all that more fun and engaging for the readership.<br /><br />Now, I haven't been a kid in, oh, quite a long while, although not as long as some. But I still couldn't put the book down! When I had to do something else, like go to work or fix supper, it was killing me to not know what was happening to Percy and his friends. It's a fun read, more fun than I expected, and kids who have already been introduced to magic through the wonderful world of Harry Potter are going to LOVE the stories of Percy Jackson. I'm about ankle-deep in the sequel, \\"The Sea of Monsters\\" and huffed just a little because I had to put it down so I could write this review. Ah, the trials of a ravenous book reader!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy being able to bring up pretty much any translation I desire.<br />This is a great item to do Bible studies.<br />I am very pleased with this addition to my KF.
B0000714BP|5.0|Love it,  this is the greates movie ever, i got it in the mail like 3 later after i order the movies can stop watching it
B00A27X972|5.0|Not quite Science fiction, but there is a lot of this genre in it. Not quite \\"self help\\" but there is a lot of that in it as well. Kind of a \\"Jonathan Living Seagull\\" meets \\"Slaughter House Five\\". Exceptional and astute observations about the human condition as seen from outside our world. Highly recommended!!
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|Great packaging. Worth owning this copy if you love the movie. The book/case is a cool idea, and the special features are very interesting.
B00377E5SG|3.0|Not bad, and a better-than-average remake, but the original was better.  Ford might be a reasonable casting choice to play the Bogart part, but Hepburn is magnificent in the original.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The format was very confusing to me.  I would be reading about a specific character, and all of a sudden, I realize it was someone else. I had to keep going back to see what I missed.
B001TCNSOI|5.0|Other reviewers have complained that this movie is too long, too depressing, etc.  Well, if you're looking for an uplifting movie, look elsewhere.  This isn't a feel-good movie.<br /><br />But this movie is incredibly well-done and well worth watching!  And the story itself is absolutely HORRIFYING.  As another reviewer noted, if it were fiction, nobody would bother with it because the story seems too contrived.  I did a bit a research on the case after watching the movie.  It's not just \\"based on a true story\\" but IS a true story -- in every horrifying detail.  Police corruption, murder, kidnapping, pedophilia, \\"mistaken\\" identity, forced institutionalization, etc. all culminate in one of the most OUTRAGEOUS injustices any American woman EVER suffered.<br /><br />I finished the film feeling absolutely heartbroken and outraged on behalf of Christine Collins and what she endured. Could this really happen in America??<br /><br />It was hard to watch Angelina Jolie play Christine's character.  Other reviewers have said she crusaded for her son and brought down the LAPD.  She did nothing of the sort.  Her delay in reporting her son missing...  Her passive acceptance in the beginning of a half-hearted investigation by the LAPD...  Her actual \\"temporary\\" acceptance of an imposter child?  My thought was \\"ARE YOU KIDDING ME??\\"  Her initial insistence that he wasn't her child, that her son was still missing was gentle and ladylike, even timid, not \\"crusading\\" at all.  Her manner was mostly passive and timid, which was INCREDIBLY irritating to watch.  (Even though she's the victim, I wanted to slap her!)<br /><br />But that's a comment on the story itself, not on the acting.  The story is a product of the times in a case gone very, very wrong.<br /><br />There is no happy ending to this story.  But it's well worth watching, both for a look at the justice and legal system at the time, for the role of women in society, etc.<br /><br />That ANY person or organization could givean imposter boy in place of a missing one and then dare to throw his mother in the loony bin when she said it was not her son...  The injustice, cruelty and arrogance is ASTOUNDING!<br /><br />Michelle
B00BD6EJRK|5.0|This app is amazing. Its so awesome. Ive made over 20 pics and there like professional no wonder its called photo studio pro lol
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Having read Hosseini's other two books, I'd have to rank this one a bit lower. It was hard to follow some of the story threads at times. It was a good read, not a great read like the other two. Just not as engrossing. Perhaps because in the other two there was one strong central character you could identify with, whereas in this story, there were several.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Loved this hilarious book by one of my favorite authors! Kinsella never fails to make me laugh and her characters are always charming and relatable.
B000LJAEFG|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it came out, and saw it again recently with my son. Still enjoyed it very much, and since I work in science research, like the exploration of the sometimes unintended outcomes of research. Some of the acting is a little stiff at times, and there are some errors in editing, but overall a great story that's still interesting to watch some 30 years after it was made. I think they did a good job of portraying researchers as multidimensional people who care about the science, but are also human with their own biases.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Purchased it for my boyfriend who loves these older movies. He was so very happy to get this movie for his collection. Gary Cooper movies are wonderful to watch.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I had the free one of this but this one is epic water burn. cut. are just a few words that you can. do get it now
0525953728|5.0|Purchased it for my boyfriend who loves these types of books. He was so very happy to get this book for his reading enjoyment collection.  My mom liked it too.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book made me feel many emotions.<br />But out of alllllllll the emotions I felt,<br />The main one, was love.
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|So first of all the game only gives you half of the stuff you really need and it really depresses you when it says 50% keep on going so I always have to cancel the patient and go to the next one. It really upsets me. Anyway, besides that the game is really fun.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|My partner and I love Maggie Smith. She's one of our favorite actresses. So we would have watched this for her if nothing else.<br /><br />But the concept and the delivery of this comedy were excellent. After all... just because a diva gets old and retires from public it doesn't mean she stops being a diva! The humor is very dry and very subtle and there are some serious threads that leave you thinking about your own old age and making the most of life's opportunities. All in all a very pleasant hour and a half and a movie we will be purchasing.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob actually made me uncomfortable.  Having no children of my own I wondered what my reaction would have been. This book held my attention even though I felt like strangling  the father.  For people with children...how would you react?
B00632HWOG|2.0|The server seems sooooo slow at times. I guess for free you cant complain too much. People who send me mail tell me that the yahoo e-mail frequently blocks their message.
145210655X|5.0|This book is filled with humor and charm!  Love it!  Definitely a must for any Star Wars fan!  My son loves it!
B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|I had already seen this, once on screen and then I bought the VCR.  I no longer have a VCR player, so needed to get it in VCR format.  Hamlet is perhaps not for Shakespeare beginners. It's long; uncut it runs a bit over 4 hours (with laughs), which is why most versions are cut.  This one, however, is not.  That's great, in my opinion, because there are no dangling threads, e.g., the whole business with Fortinbras; it turns out he's the default heir to the throne of Denmark, which naturally explains why he and his army hanging about.<br /><br />I should also say that I haven't seen anything Branagh has done--as an actor, director, or producer--that I haven't found to be at least extremely interesting.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|Even after many years this movie still rocks.  Best scary movie and now that they have a tv series on the Norman Bates before (The Bates Motel), it was interesting to see the original movie again.
B005HSL626|5.0|wow this game is so cool I'm so addicted I can not help but play it all the time its so cool.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This truly was a great movie and I am glad I purchased it. I was unable to see it on the big screen because it was not playing near my home. Maggie Smith was brilliant and I just love watching her.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Read this amazing book about words if you really need to look up a word from a through z, very nice work!
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Good science fiction show. Normally I would expect this show to be on a different network known for this type of show. It is great that some of the other networks are now doing science fiction again.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the book but was slightly confused by the Q and A in a trial setting that began early in the book. The font was different, to show that it was out of the chronological sequence of events, but it was a bit distracting to know that the narrator would be tried, or be a part of a trial, for some unknown reason at some future time.<br /><br />There was no 'happy ending' or real escape from the dilemma that was the theme of the book.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Good science fiction show. Normally I would expect this show to be on a different network known for this type of show. It is great that some of the other networks are now doing science fiction again.
B003XDZMPY|5.0|These shoes always get noticed.  They are perfect for the beach and for walking around town afterwards.  Plus, they last for years.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Good science fiction show. Normally I would expect this show to be on a different network known for this type of show. It is great that some of the other networks are now doing science fiction again.
B006S01GH2|4.0|Starts off slow but gradually gets more and more interesting, well directed with fun plot line. English sub titles are not a detriment to the movie and easy to catch onto
034580404X|5.0|I read all the mixed reviews of the 'lovers' and &#34;haters&#34; of this set.  I didn't find the writing that bad...as least not as it was portrayed in some of the reviews....c'mon...this isn't Shakespeare and isn't advertised as such.  The story line kept my attention and honestly, I never wanted to put it down.  I bought it for entertainment, and it certainly fit the bill.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Pros: Excellent graphics, great action, very forgiving of &#34;navigational&#34; errors.<br /><br />Cons: Not very complex, short overall game time. Would like to see an extended version, with more routes, more days and some hidden areas to explore.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I got this at the much trusted raving review of another kindle fire lover.  IT WILL NOT UP DATE, BEING USELESS.  What do I need to do, or what other type app like this should I try? For camera use with a KF HD?  Any suggestions will be appreciated.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|(Had been playing Plasma Sky prior to trying this so the bar may have been set too high) Really liked the graphics in their retro style, but overall game play was very weak.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an excellent book. I always cant wait till the chapter ends because each end comes with a surprise. It's worth reading, have fun! :D
B008NN8IVY|5.0|This set is pretty cool. You get 5 minifigs and 4 vehicles, so there is plenty to build and play with. I mostly got this to expand my ever growing vehicle collection, but the car garage is cool even though it looks kinda cramped lol. Still its a fun build and I think a Lego fan of any age will really enjoy this. Plus it makes a great addition to a Lego City build.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It could be better. You can't highlight anything in this book or keep notes. It's quite annoying. Also you have to search to find, for example the p section in this dictionary. I'll find out a two at the most and i'm being generous.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My kind of game! Couldn't stop playing it and was disappointed when I ran out of levels. :( More please! Just enough of a challenge to keep me entertained and not frustrate me, but not boring either. Nice balance and while the graphics aren't spectacular, they are rather well done for this type of game. Well done all around guys. I'm looking forward for more levels!
B0064J6P8W|1.0|Trashy movie, who needs that.  Better ways to spend my time.  Only watched half hour and sorry I wasted that much time.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I get choked up in the first 15 minutes of the movie more than anything. This is a great family movie, everyone can take something from it.
0439023521|5.0|This book is amazing, it is the best science fiction that I have read in a while. I would highly recommend to read the book before seeing the movie, you can really spoil the book by watching the movie before.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Great! Very helpful. I highly recommend this for those doing their own formatting, for uploading to amazon, or LuLu.  If directions are followed, a professional  quality book will be had.
1878424505|5.0|This book is a treasure and wonderful writing to live by! I would recommend it to anyone who cares about improving how they co exist in the world and how to live an authentic and empowered life.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game I think it is very fun and alittle mind challenging for having to build the cart.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|This is a feel good and very funny movie. The ending is predicable, but it works. I highly recommend it.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|A new twist on the Oz history lesson.  Enjoyable.  Easy to watch and great for the family to watch except for the very young
B001KX50BK|4.0|I have an anniversary DVD edition that has a few extra minutes that's not in this blu-ray edition but those scenes don't add anything major to the movie.
B009UZLRJE|1.0|It's not a legal item! The entire set is pirated and picture quality is horrendous for blu ray! Spoke with Amazon and they are to do an investigation, I do not see the point multiple people have complained about the same issues just pull this crap!!!!!!
0321934962|5.0|This book was the first users guide for the new Nikon D7100.  It is very informative and helps you to learn this great new camera
888370536X|5.0|Extremely high quality, durable, usable pocket book. A MUST HAVE for musicians everywhere! I keep mine on me at all times, and now I'm finding new melodies I can put into my work from all around, as opposed to just my house! The product is portrayed as high quality, and I found it to be higher still once I got it. Highly recommended!!!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I binge watched this season because it was so good and because I had to see what happened next. This show has such a huge following and I was reluctant to watch it because it isn't the type of thing that usually entertains me. I was wrong, it's thoroughly entertaining.
0765325950|5.0|The best book of the entire series by far. One of the chapters in the book is 190 pages long, but it's enjoyable throughout the entire 190 pages.
B005C0DHEY|3.0|One sided, sensational, too long and scary. Sort of a hydrocarbon version of &#34;Inside Job.&#34; I don't want to be poisoned by fracking, and I don't particularly trust the industry, but when you think about it, a lot of people have jumped at the money and not given much thought to the consequences. They have some responsibility in this too. I'd let people watch it and make up their own minds.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have to say this book had me hooked. It has twist and turns that will makes you want to get to the big finish! Then it falls flat I actually thought something happened I missed the last page.  But nope it ended all the build up this detailed story with all its twist and turns finished at a dead end. Made me wish I did not even start it.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Great move. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Highly recommend it to anyone interested in a good comedy. Was laughing all the way.
B000FBJF7I|5.0|I discovered Precious Remotswe while feeling unwell and confined to bed.  I read all 13 books one after another in a couple of weeks.<br />The positive and gentle outlook on life, paired with her realistic look at people and why they may have chosen the path they are travelling,  reminded me to look at the reason people choose to do things that may conflict with the moral codes of others.<br />With every book I learned a little more about the characters in the book and also about myself.
1451673442|5.0|I love that this is all about application and practice, not just theory. I definitely recommend it. I even started a blog of my journey with it called [...]
B009NY43NY|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this series. The reason for the three stars as it was a little more predictable than the last. I just can't see it being the last one. Sookie has had so many problems that just alluding that they may be happy until Christmas just seems a little incomplete to me.  I'm not saying it was badly written or anything, just in my opinion it could've been a little more informative toward the end or there needs to be a follow up. I like to know what happens to the rest of them, there could've been a FlashForward into the future a few years or something.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Excellent read. Ironically picked as my vacation read while in...Bar Harbor, Maine! Followed up by a trip to the Abbe Museum mentioned in the book. Highly recommended.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Gut wrenching, beautifully filmed and perfectly paced, THE CONJURING isn't just one of the best supernatural chillers of recent years - it truly deserves a place next to \\"The Exorcist,\\" \\"The Innocents\\" and \\"Poltergeist\\" as one of the more memorable cinematic excursions into the paranormal ever produced. That may sound like high praise, but walking out of director James Wan's stunning thriller, I was hard pressed to think of other horror movies that have captivated me from start to end as much as this one did.<br /><br />Chad and Carey Hayes' screenplay takes the true story of a Rhode Island family's haunting in the early `70s and embellishes it into a film that grips you from its earliest frames, while Wan - the director who single-handedly launched a decades worth of gory \\"torture porn\\" pictures with the original \\"Saw\\" - here demonstrates a far greater command of the screen with what many have already called a directorial tour de force. In fact, Wan utilizes a documentary-styled approach that's closer to William Friedkin's 1973 classic than any other supernatural film I can recall, and expertly works with John R. Leonetti's cinematography and a masterful sound design to create one of the more brilliantly directed pictures this genre has seen in years.<br /><br />The Perron family - led by parents Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston - move into their home in northern Rhode Island and quickly notice standbys of any film haunting: bumps in the night, unseen forces that cause their dog to bark, and an occasional chill that permeates the air. Their five young daughters, though, are quickly put into the crosshair of a supernatural entity that wants more than to just make its presence known, physically announcing itself by grabbing the girls and causing bruises to Taylor that she believes are just the result of an iron deficiency. Ultimately, the Perrons call in paranormal experts Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson), the earliest \\"Ghost Hunters,\\" who soonrealize the family isn't suffering from a noisy oil burner on its last legs causing a ruckus.<br /><br />\\"The Conjuring\\" carries an R rating but the film's violence is minimal and its profanity nearly non-existent. Wan eschews the gratuitousness of his past works in favor of a less is more approach that's just as scary for what you don't see as what you do (particularly when young Andrea Perron first encounters a ghost, standing in the corner of her room but only visible to her - not the audience). At first, it might be easy to resist the movie's familiar structure, but as the story unfolds, it's nearly impossible not to get wrapped up in the family's plight as the supernatural occurrences increase. The effectiveness is all due to Wan's direction and the uniformly believable performances of Taylor, Fermiga and Wilson, not to mention the unaffected young actresses playing the tormented Perron girls. Yet even with all the chilling moments, you come to care about these people, and the emotional catharsis that closes the picture is something few films in this genre have been able to duplicate (kudos to Joseph Bishara for a moody, effective score as well, with Mark Isham contributing a poignant \\"family theme\\" that plays a significant role in the film's concluding moments).<br /><br />\\"The Conjuring\\" is at a disadvantage compared to other films in its genre because it's had to follow classic films like \\"The Exorcist,\\" \\"The Haunting\\" and \\"Poltergeist.\\" For viewers resistant to horror films in general, there's probably little here they haven't seen before, and one could argue the more explicitly visceral elements of the haunting are its weakest asset. Nevertheless, Wan's movie grabs you and doesn't let go until the credits have rolled - and even then, you might be checking the rear view mirror, just to make sure nothing's followed you home. That's frightful filmmaking at its finest, and \\"The Conjuring\\" is unquestionably the most effective cinematic haunt of this generation.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Game is colourful and delightful. At times I laugh out loud. I hate that you have to buy with real money  though. But I am determined to complete without buying tokens or bananas.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 9 year old son is having a blast playing this game. He says it is like temple run but &#34;funner&#34;.
B00821OX98|5.0|I had seen many tv ads for this show. Decided to sit down and watch the first episode and was hooked from the first 2-3 minutes.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like to keep this on my backpack keychain for camping and what not and like the light weight and sturdy design.
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|This movie was quite innovative in story line and imagination.  One may have to watch it a couple of times, to absorb all the nuances that this movie contains.  I have recommended this to many friends.
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|The \\"Peace\\" album is what would have been if the Cult had not met Rick Rubin.  It is more \\"Love\\" in its sound and the sound quality on the CD is impressive!  I have The Manor Session and this definitely sounds like a different and more clean mix!  I would recommend this for any Cult fan!
B005LAIHZY|4.0|The story takes special care to set up the mother as a monster, and then they turn her into one.  As far as the term `brave' being applied to a girl who is simply fighting for respect and acknowledgement of her own merits against the tyrannical ravings of an overbearing mother who clearly rules the kingdom instead of the permissive caring father/king.......  I'm not certain what I watched was a demonstration of bravery as opposed to squirming out of a mess of her own making.  Merida is a girl who wants to go her own way and when given two grand opportunities to escape, she does just the opposite.  Instead of fleeing for her life, she resorts to trickery to get her mother to see things her way.  She finds a means of finally making her mother shut up and listen, only to have precious little to say to the woman/bear other than they need to find a means of getting out of the trouble she caused.  The fact that the mother/queen has a belated epiphany where her daughter is concerned might have more to do with the desperation to return to her normal form and not angering the only person who might be able to do just that.<br /><br />This movie is loaded with mixed messages.  They barely skirted around the issue of servitude through an arranged marriage to a total stranger.  And what about blind obedience that only serves the person making all the orders/demands?  The same person who charges, \\"we can't run away from who we are.\\"  Who we are, or what someone else wants us to be?  As for celebrating Pixar's first strong female character, I found it incredibly odd that there was a curious lack of female characters in the first place, strong or otherwise.  There was just the domineering mother, the less than dutiful daughter, a wacky witch, and for comic relief a nanny of sorts.  Why?  In this fantasy, were women supposed to be barely seen and never heard?  Evidently, this was a matriarchal society, run by an iron-willed woman, why weren't more women involved in the story?<br /><br />Not my favorite Pixar movie by a long shot.  But.  All the characters save one were fantastic, the art work was spectacular (but fared better on the theater screen than a small screen TV), loads of good humor, some excitement, it's a keeper but not a movie I will watch all that often.<br /><br />As for the viewing problems noted above, I have an older LG Blu-ray player and both the DVD and the Blu-ray disks played just fine in it.br />Not my favorite Pixar movie by a long shot.

B008K9SG9K|4.0|I got this album for my teenager, who already loves the band. If you like this band, this is a must buy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I great summer read!  Love the twist and turns of the characters, but I wanted more at the end.  Great suspense throughout the book for sure.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|This werewolf tv is so good unlike many werewolf/vampire movies!  The personal relationships of Scott w/ Alison, his mom, Derek, & Stiles makes a great dramatic show...  very much like a movie!  I like the dvd because I can watch all the shows at the same time & not have to wait for the next week!  The scripts are well-written & they add a little comedy (especially w/ Dylan O'Brian) sprinkled into the drama.  Then MTV adds some great music!  Well worth your viewing time!!
0061950726|5.0|What a wonderful book.  Loved every word and identified with the feelings of both women. There situations,sadly, are all too true. Children in the foster care system often feel that way and the foster parents don't always understand. I've been blessed to know many foster parents that do care though and it does make a difference.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Each actor creates his/her character in so believable a fashion that I stay intensely involved with all their lives.  Incredible sets - superb direction, perfect costuming. Devine stagecraft!

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Why change something that's good. The old app was perfect. This new app sucks. I'm changing to something else. I hope you see your mistake and switch back to perfect.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app really helps me see how much battery I have left and the exact time that I need to charge it.
B001QB5S3G|4.0|A beautiful story about innocence and hope, of how earthly power demonstrated through fundamentalism, religion or authority can blind man to the Truth.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Deplets my battery too fast. I unstalled it after a couple of days. Information was good but uses too much of my battery life.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I've been using this product for 2 weeks now and it's working exactly as advertised.  The 2.1 port charges my phone while Ingress is running, and even gives me a bit of charge when my phone is roaming :)  For the price, this product is very satisfactory and comes with a 12 month warranty.  Viva la Resistance ;)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its really cool and you can go all different places except for at the beginning it goes so slow that's why I took off one star but all in all a great game!!!!!!!!!!!
B000P407K4|5.0|Great movie.  Hadn't seen it in over 20 years.  Enjoyed it even more than the first time.  The over-the-top look at organizational madness still rings true.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really love being able to see the weather on my Kindle. It is cool to be able to see the weather anywhere.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun, and helps keep me busy. I have never played a game like this so this definitely was a surprise. Just didn't like t he whole posting everything on fb. Other than that it's fun.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I played this years ago. It took a few tries to remember how to win...totally worth the time! I think I may be addicted again.

B007PEIHKE|4.0|Excellent adapter. Very simple to configure and is able to handle two phone lines at once. Would suggest to others to buy!
0738711500|5.0|I have received this item yesterday and i just read a few lines started reading what the cards symbols and meanings are after about an hour i asked my friend to volunteer so that i can see how accurate the reading would be, although i need to continue reading and practicing this is my first time buying tarot cards to learn and my friends reading was just about accurate as to how she feeling and what she was going through! Love it!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If this production had gone 'PC', the entire story would have been lame. The action was tense and shocking. The execution was whip and snap; No teasing the victim to death with speeches, they just killed him. This movie was tense, good watch.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I enjoy this show immensely. The fact that the main character looks outside the given task of going to court and winning cases to see what impacts are caused by his victory or loss illuminates a strategic thinker and great leader. His protege, a fast learner with incredible intellect and appearance of a photo-mnemonic mind are a force to be reckoned with in a battle. Serious power plays and politicking involved either force your mind to generate ideas of what may happen next or leave you hanging on to your seat. I think it's a well written and performed show that would be enjoyed by people who take interest in this mentality of legal litigation, social, and political persuasion and maneuvering.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|This movie was fun to look at, nice graphics. It is a children's story, so I liked that the subject matter remained suitable throughout. I hope every kid in the world sees how nasty nose-picking is!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Enjoyed #3 as much as 1&2. Ready for book 4.<br />I didn't mind learning more about the extended characters.  They gave Eva & Gideon depth and believe ability.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a wonderful alarm. I was surprised how great it is for a free app! You can customize so much. You can set and save many alarms for different days and times. Each of those can be customized for sound, snooze, etc,I also enjoy that you can have the sound get gradually louder. The math problem options are fun too. You can set options for doing math problems to snooze or dismiss the alarm.  It has helped me not hit the snooze as many times.

B00BW5K5DO|5.0|World building but not a SIM game.  Strategy and focus required. I loved this game. I play a lot of Kindle games and this is one of the best.
B000QDA7OU|4.0|I saw this movie when I was a very young girl, probably in junior high. I had decided to become a nun when I was around 11 years old. I admired the sisters who taught catechism at our local parish and wanted to devote my life to God's work, just as they did. I entered the convent right after high school graduation in 1965. I felt truly loved and accepted by my fellow sisters, but began to feel that this life was not meant for me after 3 years. Not sure whether or not I was to stay or leave, I did finally feel that God had other plans for me and at the end of my 6th year in the convent, before renewing my vows again, and confident that I was doing the right thing, I left the convent. Seeing this movie again reminds me of my battle whether or not to stay as a &#34;prisoner of love&#34;, devoting my entire existence to my loving God. I think the movie is very well done and the story is very realistic and true to life in the convent during that era.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is a relaxed game that is fun but will not get you tense. Great game to play to unwind. Fun twist on block three games.  There is something relaxing about taking a break from the action to build an aquarium.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|This book is interesting so far (I've read about a third). But it is not a good kindle book. It has charts and pictures that are too small on my normal sized kindle. Also the nature of the book means you want to flip back and forth to different pages which is annoyingly difficult to impossible. I'll bet it's a useful paper book but as a digital book it's pretty useless.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these puzzle type of games, and this is one of the best i have played so far. Makes you think and so much fun to figure out. Hoping for more levels soon. :)
B00364K6YW|5.0|I'm an Austen junkie and I can't decide which version of P&P is my favorite- it's a tie between this and the Keira Knightley version. I think they are both fantastic and I highly recommend both for any Austen fans. The Knightley version is shorter (and sexier) therefore my go-to fix but this version is a closer adaptation to the book and I appreciate the long drawn out romance and attention to detail. (My poor husband sees either of these on and &#34;Seriously?! Again?&#34;) Colin Firth (swoon) is an excellent Mr. Darcy.
0321344758|5.0|This book has nice big print and color pictures which makes it easy to read.  It is full of good tips about building sites that are easy for users to navigate.
0800141660|5.0|This is my favorite version of S&S and I am an Austen junkie. You can't beat Hugh Grant as &#34;Mr. F&#34; and Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are fantastic. Love it!
B0035G5IOE|5.0|You have to watch this &#34;fantastic&#34; movie several times in order to get all the subtle humor. Let's all raise our juice boxes and drink to this one.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Love, love, love this book (talk about deliciously/painfully drawn-out romance) and this movie is a great adaptation of the book. A little outdated and I would love to see another good remake of Persuasion, but this would be hard to top. Ciaran Hinds is tall, dark and smokin hot.
0062238868|5.0|Arrived on time, as advertised.<br /><br />I was in the Marine Corps, so I understand the words: \\"Every Marine is a rifleman.\\"<br /><br />Jeff Cooper said that their is a big difference between a rifleman and just a man who has bought a rifle.
B00D3XAA4M|2.0|Might be good for someone who has never been to Europe as it offers a brief overview of each country
1601252463|5.0|Good price and an excellent upgrade to the core rule book. This is essential to any pathfinder campaign in my opinion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is challenging and it keeps your interest.  It is easy to navigate as well.  It is a fun game.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This story is very sweet and sad. The characters are very relatable and it's easy to imagine yourself in the same situation and trying to decide what you would do. The book is short but packed with emotion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging. Looking forward to more rooms to escape.<br />The last room was the hardest. It ended too quickly.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app was the best I like how the minions jump and there are bombs everywhere and like how u verse Victor.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|I've loved this movie ever since it first came out. There's so much to love, despite a few places where you'll need to suspend your disbelief, especially if you're a huge Sci-Fi junkie like me. I was so excited to see this on blu-ray and for such a great price I couldn't pass it up or wait for it to arrive so I could share it's awesomeness with my kids.  Both of them sat down and watched for the entire show, including the teenager who isn't into &#34;kid things&#34;, and said they enjoyed it. I've caught them watching it a few times now. :)
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|I LOVE this book &#34;Rebecca&#34; I must have read the book 15 times or more, and have enjoyed it as an audio book as well.  Never ceases to please me when I have time to read.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm not into the whole zombie craze but this series is also about character development.  I have gotten many people hooked on this series because it's not what most would expect.  I highly recommend this series.
1416550534|5.0|This is the 3rd book I have read by Kate Morton.  Well written, as is all her novels.  A charming story that takes you back to a time when we thought life was more simple.  I must read for all her fans.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The second season is my absolute favorite in this series.  I have watched it multiple times and never get sick of it!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|You can listen to any station practically anywhere in the world. It's great especially if you just want to hear native speakers of other languages when trying to learn a new one.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|My family lives Star Trek TNG. Even our one year old loves it. A great show for the entire family!
B00000FC5H|5.0|If you ever listened to Earth Wind and Fire, you have to like this CD! All great songs with no disappointments.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Great romance novel but the responsiblity of the characters gets in the way of happiness and leaves you empty at the end.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It makes clear pic.  I like it and recommend It.  I need to read more of the directions to learn about more possibilities.
B0060D2QR6|3.0|Loved the book but hate the movie. I am not into romance type of books but Mr. Sparks has a way of drawing you in.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Loved this book! I was captivated from beginning to end. An amazing adventure and very inspiring! Reminds me of how truly amazing and joyful life can be if we let it.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|What would it take to make a movie as timeless and as enjoyable as the Wizard of Oz? Talented directors and actors have for decades taken stories from OZ and brought them to us in that attempt. Most of the time the story is warm and enjoyable (as is this one), but cannot touch the classic.<br />There are enough interesting scenes in this movie to make it watchable. There has obviously been some heart put into it. I, sadly found the acting a bit 'off' and never could accept any of the actors in their roles.<br />I can only say the movie is watchable and maybe if they had attempted to film it the old fashioned way with no CGI, it would have given it more of a prequel feeling of the classic.<br />Anyone notice that they DID leave a story untold for a sequel? They still must tell us the tale of the Ruby slippers...........
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I gave this book three stars mostly for the colorful descriptions and saying  of the characters particularly rose which reminded me of my own wee mother.  The story had some terribly sad parts which is not why it only got three stars but because it was so predictable especially towards the end.  I would recommend this book for people who like fluffy romantic comedies but know in advance there are some seriously disturbing sad elements of child abuse as well.
B00CVPAJ94|5.0|WE SAW THE MOVIE IN THE THEATER AND LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT WE DECIDED TO BUY ONE OF OUR OWN.  WE HAVEN'T WATCHED IT AGAIN YET, BUT ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.  YES, WE WOULD RECOMMEND IT, BUT CAN'T SAY THAT WE THINK IT IS FOR EVERYONE ALOT BECAUSE OF THE SWEARING.
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|Huge fan of the bad and most of the tracks on this album.  But, not their best work..  Gone Cold, Isabella...so amazing.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Gotta love the PS controllers. Ever since the PS1, the shape and button layout has been great! Will definitely use
B00506NRBS|5.0|A true powerful writing and life changing ideas<br />coming from a person who done it by his own so very not traditional way.<br />HELL YEH!!
B000I0XLYO|3.0|I was so hyped to see this movie, but it just didn't do it for me as much as I expected.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Only complaint is that indicator does not specify what is actually happening with the barometric pressure. Want to see either steady, falling, or rising. Would like to be able to tell my patients as to why they are having a tough time breathing or suffering from increased pain.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I loved being able to read the whole series at one time. It was like having one huge book. The stories that referred to previous events or characters were made better because I was able to connect to them immediately.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|My personal opinion about this movie is simple. This movie is funny, captivating, and cool. The script was well crafted and it got to me in an emotional level. I can't wait to see part 2.
B008OOYALE|4.0|So you start out the game with a small clearing in a bunch of trees. Eventually you have to expand your clearing clearing that you can get more dragons. To be able t o be able to expand, however, you have to buy that plot of land with game coin... and after your first couple of plots, you have to buy a special map with gold (which you have to buy with real money). I wish that they had just left a way to be able  to play free instead of forcing  you to pay. Otherwise it's a really fun game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day is a great story teller.  Love her characters and how they intertwine.  Hope she will have more in this series!  Looking forward to the next step in the lives of Eva and Gideon.!
B009CF3MEK|4.0|Enjoyed both of these films.  1974 version follows the novel more closely.  DeCaprio was a better Gatsby than Redford.  Redford seemed to cosmopolitan than Gatsby should be.  Mia farrow was a better Daisy, more scatterbrained, than Cary Mulligan who seemed to young for the part.  Waterston a better Nick than McGuire.  Would recommend both especially if a fan of Fitzgerald.
B009PLKCEE|5.0|Really really useful. I was having trouble with my kindle since it can't reproduce AVI, but this works marvels. Glad I Downloaded it!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Well written series about country life in England.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys English period pieces.  Originally watched the entire series on PBS.
0345529057|5.0|It came really fast and the books are awesome. I would say that is totally worth buying it. Thanks for the product.
B003B02O7I|4.0|Grreat story!  Intrigue, excellent characters and plot. It took me places I've never been and to situations I've never been in.<br />A learning experience, as well as a recreational one.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This game is great ( if u like strategy games ) I liked it because it's fun tryin to collect the stars. :P
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is just like playing Magic with real cards. Lots of fun and worth it to buy the full version
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I like this game cuz u can put makeup on them and jewelry and u can dress them up with what ever u want
B00425S1H8|5.0|Prolific driver works with this chipset on osx 10.8.  The prolific driver does not work on osx 10.8 with the older PL2303 chipset.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|It was a good moral good actors an a good all around love story made me happy to watch it
B008XCQ8VC|3.0|Content is gorgeous as per I remembered but text is as though it was typed on an old manual typewriter. It is faded like a copy of a copy of a copy. I know its a reprint but did think the quality would be a little better.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|My kids wanted to watch it again an again an again it was a good story with a good lesson
1440052891|3.0|Text as though it was written on an old manual typewriter. Faded and looks like it has been copied then copied and copied with a very low toner. Love the story though. A classic.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|glad we watched it . It was nothing like the first one but it made a good show for me an the hole family I would watch it again
B005544V6A|5.0|Once you start watching this series, you'll be hooked!!  It's about the inner workings of a law firm (not too nice), but the human side of the characters reels you in!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|It's stupid very very very stupid i mean i havent even used it and im just bored so im making  a review for something to do its kinda boring though OH WELL
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was extremely fast paced, clever, and a ton of fun!<br /><br />Twins, Sophie and Josh are the subject of a prophecy.  A prophecy that tells that one will have the power to save the world and one will have the power to destroy it.  They kind of stumble into the whole situation when they try to help Josh's boss, and things get kinda crazy from there.  There are many interesting situations, and I love the way the author incorporates real people and real events (such as the Great Fire of London from 1666).<br /><br />This book was a lot of fun.  Fans of Guillaume Prevost's Book of Time series or Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and the Olympian's will love this book.<br /><br />The only reason that I didn't give this five stars is because it is written for a younger audience.  I think teens, especially around 12-13 will find this to be well worth five stars.  It would be good for younger children too.  All in all, this was a blast and I'm very glad I read it.
0374275637|1.0|the author used too many examples to illustrate the same thing,  all of which are boring - like a self indulgence professor who has been at his job way too long.<br />I started to resent the time spent reading this thing, and after a few chapters, tossed it out.  It offers not much that it new or insightful, beyond Psychology 101 or, perhaps, 201<br /><br />in a sentence:  the book compared conditioned forethought with analytical thought, and cognitive dissonance,<br />eg. first impressions VS time to think through based on facts gathered after.<br />that's the whole book,  actually I would love a refund.<br />writing style is so stiff, that I kept thiningk of starch.<br />it reminded me of a self published text book, that no one actually wanted to read.<br /><br />the title sounded intriguing, but that is where is ended<br /><br />poor
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|It was great and the ending was fantastic and I will miss the show,but I know the actors have other commitment.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice GAME. It's just challenging enough to drive u crazy for a second then u find it solution and its fun lol. Nothing like 100 floors this game gives u a whole room to explore and the solutions are not things u would never think of or find like other escape games. My only complaint is they shouldn't have released it till they had more then  10 levels ready. Please hurry with the new levels so we can keep playing :-)
B001LF347E|5.0|The show was done so well, I read about camelot and it was about it.  The actors were great and can't wait to see more seasons
B001H1SVO8|5.0|A masterpiece of cinematic editing too. It is in my opinion the best of 1999's three great American films (the others being the Matrix and American Beauty) Still relevant to young people today.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout disc if you only have 20 minutes to spare but if you can also do 2 or 3 levels at the same time if you have 40 minutes or 1 hour to spare. It has 3 levels of exercise: level 1 for beginner, level 2 for intermediate and level 3 for advanced. Each level is 20 minutes long. Since it is only 20 min long, I think it is only for intermediate level. Advanced level should stick with Bob Harper or maybe do all 3 levels at the same time. Either way, you will get a good sweat after you are done with just one level.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I wish they gave you more chances to get collection items and tracked duplicates in some way. But overall I am addicted.
B009WUBERW|3.0|I liked the first original version of this movie much better.  This one seemed a bit forced and predictable.  Perhaps I just had higher expectations.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game it's really fun I like the grooming game where you clean the dirt off the most it's really fun I recommend this game to kids.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is the absolute best movie of this type that I have ever watched, which includes the dark knight and the iron man series.  I really love this movie.  The hulk simple stole the show for me...lol
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|if you like Mahjong games this a must have game. lots of puzzles to play. great pass time. and very addictive ... I give it a 5 star!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game very good graphics and very fun and easy for any one to play all in all a very good game!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|The relationships explored throughout this book make for involved reading.  The format of short character incidents makes the interactions understandable from both Eleanor and Park's points of view.<br /><br />Interesting reading, and the hope I look for in a book shows up at the end in a subtle yet intriguing way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The concept of this book is so compelling. The characters have so much depth and the storyline becomes more and more complex. The Hunger Games series are some of the few books I can read over and over again.
1577314808|5.0|This book invites readers to be attentive to what is going on in the present moment, letting go of the past and anxiety for the future
6305781427|5.0|I've liked him since our days at the UofM I just wish  he would play more, and remember us who knew him back when!
B009WUBERW|5.0|This movie is exactly what it is billed as - loud, large and fun. A classic satirical look at the hero-action genre that is fun especially for those of us who have grown up with these movies! Not for young kids though, unless you can explain the biology behind exploding heads!! :)
B00005B1W5|5.0|I've liked him since our days at the UofM I just wish  he would play more, and remember us who knew him back when!
B0045XGRQE|5.0|A fantastic sequel to the original, though away from the normal comic storyline. Don Cheadle really handles War Machine well!
B0089LOG02|4.0|What a good, tender summer read.  Not a page turner but a solid caring book of people I came to care about and weep over.  I can't read and have my eyes leak it is kinda' hard.  :-)
B0082P6JZA|5.0|The Transporter movies, to me, get better each time and this closes out the trilogy quite beautifully. A fun ride!
B0084B0656|5.0|a brilliant mind - up there with cs lewis.  they were admirers of each others work.  &#34;George Bernard Shaw, Chesterton's &#34;friendly enemy&#34; according to Time, said of him, &#34;He was a man of colossal genius.&#34;  He wrote: philosophy, ontology, poetry, plays, journalism, public lectures and debates, literary and art criticism, biography, Christian apologetics, and fiction, fantasy and detective fiction.  GIANT indeed... get to know his works for the sake of brain!
B00CWVBTUU|3.0|Very funny take on Batman with the Legos, but the Lego City franchise movies and cartoons are a lot funnier.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was recommended that I read the book before seeing the movie....so glad I did!! It's the best book on the zombie apocalypse out there...Walking Dead fans?? This one is for us!!
B005ILYZ34|3.0|I got on a Jason Statham kick and out of them all Blitz, while a good thriller mystery type movie, did not hold my attention as the storyline jumps all over the place. And because there are no bad-ass fight scenes, it wasn't what I was wanting at the time. But a decent movie with a decent storyline.
B002BCNK1Q|1.0|I didn't want to watch this, I had to for a class. This movie is garbage. It tries to be deep but it is a one dimensional shameless and pointless tear jerker. Every character is based on racial stereotypes, which is ironic, since the theme of the movie is about overcoming racism. If you're going to make a drama this dark, the quality of the writing, acting, and directing needs to be excellent. The writing in this movie was horrible.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What an incredibly fun game! My kids and I both love it! We like all playing it at the same time and see how far we get:)
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Although Max Brooks creates a magnificent depiction of a world-wide zombie apocalypse, the onslaught of survivor interviews tended  to be too repetitious.  Lack of character development and plot sequence.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|The beginning of a great series that just gets better with each book!  Harry hole is fascinating and very sexy.
0061900656|5.0|Fun book for my son to prep for his little brother. Too bad the pages are not hard, but I guess that's what I picked.<br />Delivery was timely.
B004Y03MQQ|4.0|I have all the old stuff on vinyl, so adding this to my collection was a nice treat, though I have most of it on a digital format.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|As I've mentioned in other reviews of EC albums his music was an important part of my youth and formative years. The same is true of Steve Winwood from the epic Blind Faith through the traffic years and his solo career. I have a predisposition to love their music.<br /><br />This reunion was very long in the making. Clapton's guitar shows experience and polish, but also the ravages of time have taken some toll. There are some riffs that don't quite come off in this show that I think would have in years past.<br /><br />Steve Winwood's voice was often at the limits of its range in the days of Blind Faith and his willingness to take his voice to the edge was part of his appeal to me. With my life barely feeling in control Steve's voice singing &#34;sea of joy&#34; helped me feel a bit more ok at feeling at that edge of control myself.<br /><br />So when Steve's voice goes a bit over the edge or they either doesn't quite seem to make as clean a riff or transition as they might have in their (and my) younger years I'm very willing to forgive and take joy in the reunion of two old friends.<br /><br />I think the important thing is not to expect the same dynamic they had years ago. It's something different now... less of a hot sizzle and more a slow cooked flavor-delight that can only be borne out of time. It's just not the same after all these years. For me it's better, and a recognition of the time and experience they have both gained.<br /><br />One surprise for me was the Buddy Miles tune &#34;Them Changes&#34; as I had not been aware of their connection with him.<br /><br />After getting the CD  I also got [[ASIN:B003A3NGFK Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood: Live From Madison Square Garden]] DVD which is great too.<br /><br />Well done Stevie and Eric. Well done.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|downloaded the app but it would never play the game screen would come up then kick me right out. So after a few tries I just uninstalled the app.
B0061S073A|5.0|This does a good job.  We use it for a three yr old and she can access exactly what I want her to. I was prepared to pay for an app like this so was very pleased!
B0092AKDQK|5.0|I love Jascha Heifetz' playing and having heard a couple LPs with Gregor Piatigorsky I had to have more.  This set gives me more than I could have hoped for.<br /><br />The sound is, for the most part, very forward and dry, but there's a charm to that.<br /><br />In any case, beautiful collection.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|We have all of Buble's CD's and this one is ok but he has done better. A Sinatra imitator but to a new fresh level.
0670014893|2.0|That's me dropping the book...I forget, because I fell asleep so many times reading just a few pages and each time I awoke I found the book on the floor. Listen, every book by a serious writer is a labor of love. Dickens said that true love is \\"always returned.\\" Sadly, this book did not love the author back. It made my mouth pucker...as if I'd been sucking on lemons.  I don't care what JLC's politics are, that didn't bother me particularly.  All I care about is a well-written book with great characters. As in \\"The Perfect Spy.\\" Or \\"Tinker, Tailor\\" et al.  The guy is one of my favorite writers. So imagine my disappointment when, salivating, I began this book (which began well enough, by the way...good opening) and slowly found myself snoozing away, wondering whether continuing to read would be a good use of my time. Well, I didn't. Think so. There was something ickily sentimental going on here...sort of precious. I can't stand when I am thumped over the head with the characters' \\"nobility.\\"  In \\"The Perfect Spy\\" and other novels by this great writer one fell in love with hugely flawed, questionable characters. Yup, that's the problem here, pure and simple. I felt Kip was going to be one of those wonderful Le Carre people, but it was not to be. By the end, everyone was insufferably \\"good.\\" Still, I soldiered on to the bitter end, which I was so relieved finally came.
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|This was the first novel I read of Jodi's and it was nothing to write home about, I thought the story was very boring and the character's even worse. I hated it from start to finish but I am willing to read another one of her Novel's to give her a fair chance.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|It twas very realistic and I liked it very very very very very very very much. Running any jumping and shooting and sadness I liked this book and I hope u will to.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app because i can watch you tube videos later with no need of wi-fi or data connection
B001GCUNW6|5.0|This is by far my favorite of all the Ice Age movies. Don't get me wrong, they are all cute, but this one is my favorite.
B00C5GZKVQ|2.0|Graphics are not good and game is not interesting in fact i uninstall this game<br />Sorry but i am honest.
B003XCVQ3C|4.0|I bought this to hook up my MacBook Pro to my tv.  Works great.  I would recommend it to anyone in need of viewing streaming video on big screen.
B00594XOZU|4.0|A person said theyd get me a new profile picture they did but i coudnt save it plz fix otherwise awesome app :)
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Great read- makes one think about the various aspects of time and the human condition.  I recommend this book for all.
B00D4PDJMY|5.0|I can't stop listening to this. The tracks are just relentless. This IS my new workout soundtrack, without a doubt!
B004WR125O|5.0|Does just as it is supposed to do, allows for wifi connection with your Onkyo Receiver to your home wifi or wherever. Allows pandora, last FM, slacker radio and any other apps to work thru wifi internet connection.
B0091REZMW|4.0|as long as u have a lot of patience you will enjoy ths game but i have found that patience is required
B004ER2GGG|5.0|amazing quality. vinyl was as stated exactly. no scratches nothing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun to play and use your brain for a change. I think this is my fav puzzle game of all of gem.
B001DCZ4IW|3.0|Not sure the movie was really my cup of tea. I watched the movie to earn points in class.<br />Enjoyed the movie overall, but not one i would go out and rent again.
B0038W0OIK|4.0|Really great sound quality and sound staging, virtual surround doesn't work well though, the surround effect still seems stereo-ish to me
B001DJLD1M|5.0|I was originally just looking for the animatrix film, but I figured I needed to upgrade my other movies a little also. I figured it's for the right price & these movies are awesome.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The first movie started slow but as you watch further you realize that there's more at stake than those people involved in the game.. This is about how the people will get their strength to fight against a very corrupt government .. People who  are determined to have their freedom'n
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best game ever, I am very addicted to it. It is a challenge to keep beating your top score...I love it.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Thank you for a very reasonable price for such a great movie.. I love everything about it.. The actors.. The love story and the ending.. Thank you also for the on time delivery and the DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition
B007YLEMDE|5.0|Don't know what there is to dislike about this album. It's Stevie Ray (and others), but it's Stevie Ray. Since he was taken away in his prime, his available music was cut way too short. If you like SRV this is a must have.
0375714839|5.0|had to get it for an english summer assignment and so worth it the best thing its that it has pictures it like a comic book bt better.
B00AEFXE3Q|5.0|One of the greats.  Portrays the time era perfectly and superb acting! I've loved it since I first saw it in high school
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I liked most of the puzzles in this game and look forward to more.  They were not super hard but do make you think.  Tried some other similar games and some are so out there that you have to go online for help and others are so easy, they must be meant for a younger audience.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I'm coming up on my second month of using this and so far it has been a blast.  The surround sound sounds amazing on the games that support it, and the bonus of not needing a separate sound card seals the deal.  This was well worth the price.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Unless you WANT to spend extra money for bubbles or lives, this is NOT the game to get.  To make it through subsequent levels, you are going to have to buy things.  I don't think even the most adept gamer can get through without buying more or begging off their facebook friends for something.  Still a cute pastime with some skill required but not the frenzy moves of other games.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Very well produced, good script, good actors but more violence than I prefer.  Most people I know rave about it.  I am probably the odd person out.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I thought the book was really good! I'm pleased with it and I can't wait to read book 3 (:
B006MPKDD6|5.0|Not up to writing great reviews, but anything by Michael Connelly is exceptional and this in my opinion is everything I expected from Michael. I enjoyed it.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|The story jumps from one year to another with focus on one person. It tries to web together different stories which are continents apart but it comes out as a little confusing. Overall an okay read.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|After my first listen i wasn't really crazy about it, mostly cause i wasn't expecting how the songs were going to be, but boy was i wrong after listening to it again. Great mix of darkness and melodic songs. One of my favorite albums of the year. Incredible follow up to Part 1.
B001NA6096|3.0|Before I see the new film, Before Sunset, I decided to see its two predecessors, Before Sunrise and Before Midnight. Though somewhat dated now, this 1998 film does capture the sense of serendipity that travelers often experience on the road. When Hawke and Delpy's characters meet on a train in Europe, the attraction is mutual, so they decide to disembark together in Vienna, in order to continue their conversation until the young American man must catch his plane home the next morning, and the French woman will continue her journey to Paris. This film is all about the dialogue, as the couple wanders the streets of a beautiful European city all night, sharing memories and thoughts, and finally falling just a little bit in love. As she boards her train the next morning, they agree to meet again in six months. I'm looking forward to Before Midnight to continue the story.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Great game. It's one you can spend hours playing. It's like two games in one. First it's,a match 3 game with lots of different playing boards it's always different. Then you have a fish tank you buy a variety of different fish and supplies for from the money you win during the match 3  game. Visually pleasing and fun to play
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this app it kinda reminds me of subways surfers but with cute minions which makes it so much more fun
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|\\"Wonder\\"by R.J. Palacio,is an inspiring book about a funny,kind child by the name of August to with an unfortunate birth defect who is going to be in one of the worst situations of his life,going into middle school.  The book consists on many different point of views and their relationship with August. August soon learns that being friendly and being a friend are 2 different things. This book has some minor bad language,uses a large vocabulary,and has some positive and negative role models.I recommend this book to reader's 10+, who have an open heart and are seeking a book that can open your mind to a whole new world.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun little game. Challenging for my family. My daughter loves it and can't wait for more levels.
B007SUW24W|5.0|extremely happy with this music, would recommend to anyone  talented guy, very enjoyable  please enough all ready, it's good please
B005DJREJS|5.0|What can I say - I liked it. Cant wait to see more episodes,  Not for pre-teens. About a high school student, probably would wait to let your kid watch in when they get into high school.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I'm just getting back into reading and this is my second book I have read through this year. Killing Floor is the first book I have read in 12 years.<br />I love reading these Jack Reacher books and will continue till I have read them all.
B002UBRFDC|3.0|I think I got through half of it but it got longer and longer, and when I lost it when I accidentally reset my Kindle, I did not want to repurchase it. I doubt if I could read it where I left off anyway. I would recommend it if you are prepared to spend the time and effort. I was not.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great and fun game where you can try to defeat the bad guy named vector who stole a freeze-ray
B002MQYOFW|3.0|on DVD, so I decided to read the book. I would not recommend it. I got the second one on Audiobook but doubt if I would read the last book in the series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The best app for everyone and anyone. My eight yr. Old has a pinterest and loves it. I recommended this. App. For everyone. Five Star
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I bought this for my niece - she watches this ALOT!  VERY COLORFUL!!!  Nice story line for children.  Made me giggle too!!!
034580709X|3.0|For whatever reason, Jo Nesbo, the Norwegian writer of detective stories, has had the English-language versions of his novels published in an odd sequence.  Nesbo is author of the Inspector Harry Hole series, which has been published in the following order in English: book 5 to start, then 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and now, finally, the first book in the series.  After reading it (The Bat), I can speculate on why the English publication of the series opener took so long.  It is an adequately engrossing mystery, but the characters are developed in a scattershot fashion, Harry's back-story is revealed sloppily and confusingly, and the plot takes annoying jumps that undermine the story.  Even with all those shortcomings, though, I had enough interest in what was happening to see The Bat through to the end, and it will certainly be of interest to fans of the HH series.
0783225482|4.0|All the actors are wonderful in this movie.  Good laughs...I had not seen this for sooo long.  Nice to have in the video library!!!  :)
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Have rented it, watched it on satellite and will enjoy the blu-ray dvd.&#34; Now that's jenga.&#34;  Seth Rogan was perfect for the voice of Paul.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series of books are amazing. The best parts are the journeys you take with the main character Jules. Meeting all the new characters along the way always kept me wondering who is the next new one was going to be. I can't stop with this one , there has to be more. What a trip so far Hugh.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I don't know how I have missed reading anything before by this author. I have been reading for over 65 years. I really enjoyed the entire book. It was fast moving, the character had a lot of heart. I don't understand the reviews that were not very flattering. Maybe because I have not read his other books, which I plan to do in the future, I did not have any preconcieved expectations. I have placed a request from my local library to start with book one, am looking forward to many a good read by this author.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|Good job on updating the story, dance numbers good, used the original music in clever ways. Makes me want to watch the original to compare.
B00B97TMIE|5.0|Never expected to love every song on this CD! Every song is a breath of fresh air. So beautiful. I just love this CD and have been playing it on repeat.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Love the style, the concept and it was fascinating from start to finish. Highly recommended read
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I absolutely love this CD! Every song is amazing. I can relate to several of them. This is by far my favorite CD by this group!!! I am so addicted to this whole CD!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love escape games. The app works well and the puzzles make sense. they start out really easy and get harder.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I have read his 2 other books and love his style- but this one seemed out of character- the story line was both contrived and partly predictable.  I was disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|got this app for my eight year old grandson. he would play it continuously if I would let him. I would have given it five stars, but it tends to freeze up occasionally on my Kindle Fire.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|NOT a gamer but enjoy playing! Not sure what all to do but, will vet the hang of itsoon I hope!!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|glad to have this app on my Kindle Fire. is so convenient for me to have it available whenever I need to search for something. I would recommend this app
B00701L5XS|5.0|I have used this app to help my scout troop with their knots. They really enjoy the 3d animations  and it makes the knots easier to learn.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a good 'basic' calculator. I use it frequently and I haven't had any problems with it so far. I would recommend
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show never did get the attention it deserved. A great cast and clever writing--worthy of at least five years instead of the two years it was on. Fun to see it again.
B004VOBIE8|2.0|If it will help me move my stuff off my kindle in large groups,  I will love it.  If not,  it is  gone.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The start was great. After that I was unsure if I was reading the same book. It was hard to believe that the same author had written Kite Runner and A thousand Splendid Suns. I don't know if I missed the point, but with too many characters and too many things going on, it was hard to focus and enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|At first it was kind of cool to figure out the codes nd stuff but as I started going up to different flies I sensed something evil about this game and sure enough, I was right. 10th floor image on elevator door n found that eye (Iluminaty images)Plain Evil. I deleted from my Kindle.
B008JFUO72|2.0|The Good- Robert Downey Jr. gives a solid performance as Tony Stark.  The chemistry between Stark and Rhoadie is much better here than in Iron Man 2.  The scene in which Stark's house is destroyed is top-flight filmmaking.<br />The Bad-  The scene where his house is destroyed is the first action sequence of the movie and also the best of the film. That's bad.  For some reason, there are no working Iron Man suits throughout the entire movie (either the weapons system is down but he decides to wear the suit anyway, or all his suits break apart like toys from a thrift shop). The fraility of the suits was annoying. He gives one a karate chop after it goes haywire in response to a nightmare he is having and it crumbles like an old cookie. Huh?  Yet, in the Avengers, he gets caught up in the rotor of the SHIELD heli-carrier and the suit remains intact (as it should, otherwise Tony Stark would be dead). Another negative was the lack of a villian who posed a threat.  In this movie we are promised the Mandarin, but in an act of blatant false advertising the audience is cheated and we are given 'Firedude' as the main villian.  Then, Iron Man must fight Firedude's henchman who have the same power as the main villian (borrrring).  Firedude is too busy constantly making jokes to ever prove a menance to Iron Man.  Super Patriot is completely wasted in this movie.  A cool looking suit, but all he ever does is walk around.  There is also a lot of mistimed humor here, namely, at the film's climax (not really the time for slapstick, but rather, to get the audience pumped up).  The climax is an unmitigated diaster, everyone jumping around as if it were a videogame and ordinary people making jumps with Spider-man like grace.Huh? The end of the film deconstructs what the previous two had  established (see for yourself). Tony Stark is physically in an Iron Man suit for about 15 minutes (probably less) of the 2+ hour movie. Uhhh, isn't that the whole point of the movie?<br />The Deal- Shane Black misses by a country mile here.  While there are some good scenes, the parts are greater than the sum.  I was somewhat disappointed in Iron Man 2, but Iron man 3, makes Iron Man 2 look like Iron Man 1. The story was interesting up until about the mid-way point where the wheels came off in a hurry.  If you like seeing Tony Stark beat up baddies without his armor, then this movie is your cup of tea.  Initially, I was excited about Shane Blank writing and directing. 'Wow' I thought, that's the guy who did Lethal Weapon.  Then it hit me, what else did he do? Uhhhhhhhhhh......yeah. Steer clear of this one if you haven't seen it, just watch the Avengers again.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I really enjoy this, especially Wagon Wheel...The songs are all heartfelt and seem to be part of a larger story.
B001VLBDD0|4.0|I see that this has been around for more than twenty years. Not much to add to the  previous reviews. Acting skill is not required to star or be featured, just the ability to seem to be doing all these stunts and to give voice to the occasional few words or sentences without falling on your  face. This these performers do. The rest is action and more action. I found the whole enjoyable though not materially better than many films of the same genre. Coming in at just under 150 minutes, it is a lot to bear with all at once. The time goes fast, however.<br />Much too late to make a serious recommendation: but, here goes, any action fan who wants no conceptual or emotional problems with a movie, will find this one entertaining.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is one of my all time movie favorites.  After wanting a copy of my own my hubby bought it for me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The characters in this story were so well written.  I absolutely loved Augustus and found myself wishing I knew him.  If you love to read do not miss this book!
B004EPZ084|4.0|This is one of those movies that I watch every time I'm flipping through channels and see that it is on!  It is propelled by very good actors who have thrown themselves into roles that they enjoy ... and luckily have a good script with hilarious one-liners to back them up!  This doesn't get 5 stars because it isn't Academy Award worthy stuff, but WOW it is good entertainment.  As long as you don't mind graphic and profane language (al in the name of fun, of course), you can sit back and enjoy a fun ride!  Three guys have bosses that are making their lives MISERABLE.  Then the plot to the old movie \\"Strangers on A Train\\" dawns on them, and they decide that if they kill each other's bosses, there will be no motive and they can get away with it.  Of course, everything goes wrong which leads to even more hilarity and fun!  Watch it....maybe even buy it!  It's a great Saturday night movie!
B007712XAU|5.0|We never saw this series when it aired on PBS. Everyone we know loved it so we decided to get the disks. These disks arrived brand new in sealed boxes. The shipping was super fast...great seller!!
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I really like this movie. Even though the melodrama and misinterpreted translations can be a bit much, the end is always satisfying.
B0094OLJD0|5.0|I LOVE this album.  Love it.<br /><br />Initially, I heard \\"Who\\" on the radio, and being both a St. Vincent and a David Byrn fan, I streamed the album on Rhapsody.  It was fine.  A little weird...and I didn't really grasp on to any songs, but it was good.  After listening to it off an on over a year, I finally bought it and I'm obsessed.<br /><br />Music is pretty subjective and you like what you like, but I promise this is one of those albums that will continue to surprise and delight.<br /><br />AND if you're a band geek or have any familiarity with Giovanni Gabrieli, the brass will BLOW YOUR MIND.  I feel like I'm tripping in a cathedral.  Weird?  Yes.  But great.
B00A861QMM|3.0|I ENJOY THE GAME BUT IT DOES HAVE ITS FLAWS.  IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THE items are hard to find as a matter of fact you have to use hint to find all the symbols. However I did like the game a lot.
1250000971|5.0|Like all of Jeffrey Archer's novels this one transports you to another world.  I have yet to find a book of his that doesn't keep me reading till its done!  I can't wait for the next book in this series.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|love this figure and brings great childhood memories of dbz back in the good old days of toonami 4-5pm. probably the best goku figure ever and will sell out fast so pick it up. only downside is the figure is kind of tight around the knee joints and afraid it will break if i put goku in crouch or kneeing poses but other than that, a great figure nonetheless.
B001HN6918|5.0|I brought this for a christmas gift for a &#34;Kung Fu Panda&#34; fan.  Had to watch it as soon as it was opened.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challenging and frustrating at times but good. :)  I hope there are more games to come in the future. keep up the the good work.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game design and playability. Iblike that 8t will keep growing when your not actuallbplayibg.<br />Fun easy to play and addictive
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Had no desire to see this, but the wife made me watch it and I can only say it was awesome and hilarious.  The acting was incredible and witty.  Very nice story, I'm glad I watched it.
B006GKHE6G|1.0|Broken controls.  Tilt no longer works and touch controls only work on occasion.  Would really like a refund.  This really stinks.
B00CATSONE|2.0|Pretty much written at a 6th grade level.  It's really the front end to a sales pitch.  A few things I didn't know, but pretty much a waste.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|Shawshank Redemption is one of my all time favorites. It is even more enjoyable with Blu-Ray  high definition. This is one of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins'  best performances.  Although I favor almost all that Morgan Freeman does,  it is easy to immerse yourself in the film's  drama, action and occasional dry humor time and time again. HD is a plus but the movie is great without it.
0345525558|5.0|I was assigned to read this book for a summer clas I am taking. I wasn't sure what to expect but I thouroughly enjoyed reading this.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Couldn't put it down, it was much more than a love story, dealt with the harsh realities of life and the huge decisions people often have to make even if they don't want to. I will certainly be recommending this to my book club group. I will certainly look at other books by the author.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Then you will love this series also. I bought the first episode by mistake then had to buy the whole season and I cant wait for season 2 to come out!!!!
B009S7ZDIU|5.0|I AM NOT A FILM CRITIC - I JUST ENJOY THIS SERIES BECAUSE IT'S WELL WRITTEN, WELL ACTED, AND I WORKED IN OFFICES DURING MANY OF THE SAME YEARS THIS SHOW COVERS AND I DELIGHT AT THE ACCURACY OF THE RESEARCH.  I ALSO LOVED THE BONUS DVD IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THE CAST TOGETHER TALKING IN A MORE CASUAL PERSONAL WAY - I WOULD RECOMMEND YJIS SERIES TO ANYONE - AND HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS ALIKE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|So I had to see it twice and then I kidn of got it. None the less, the actors in the movie are some of my favorites and the special make up was out of this world.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicting and fun! Great way to waste time. Love it!! Minions are adorable and entertaining! Can't get enough of it!
B005KAH7QU|5.0|This is one of those movies that it builds on you and the suspense of what is going to happen next, is exciting!
B001ECDVKE|5.0|What a laugh! Earth is invaded by an advanced race of aliens.  The reactions of the US are typical and very funny political satire.  Has a similar plot to the classic War of the Worlds.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The only way to explain it is AWESOME! I absolutely love it. AwEsOmE! Blab Blab Blab Blab Blab blab Blab I meant B L A H
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Very interesting movie about aging, family, gangs, and the church conflicting with a tough Korean war veteran (Eastwood). One of my favorite movies.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game to pass the time!  My grandson's crazy about it!  Easy to download and really fun! It's a hit!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  So glad to own it now. Can't wait to watch over and over. Highly recommend.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is the continuation of the Clancy family of characters.  This is the third novel featuring Jack Ryan Jr. as a main character.  It's interesting to watch Clancy's old characters take a &#34;back seat&#34; to his newer ones (Ding, Ryan Jr, e.g.), but he does a great job of bringing these newer characters into the limelight, and I look forward to many more novels featuring them.  If you're a Clancy fan, you won't be disappointed.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Its very fun, silly and fun.  It reminds me a bit of Buffy the Vampire slayer.  A little campy but really good!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good program that provides the necessary information and is easy and quick to use.  It provides necessary and timely information.
B0013WJGJ0|3.0|I bought this on amazon instant video for a movie night. Id seen two of the new batman movies and I hoped this would have some decent action in it, but found out that batman doesnt fight joker until the very end of the movie. The only major problem though is that every time he meets joker, he has to rescue Vicki Vale. After a while, it gets boring but overall this is an okay movie.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Addicting :). Great for kids just learning to match; older folks to keep the mind sharp.  Needs more levels and some difficulty.  Thanks....
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but given the obscurity of this other I felt it necessary to let people know what a great book this was.  Well written with great characters I am greatly looking forward to book two.
B000FA6720|5.0|Characters seem almost alive, plus who doesn't like a good love story.  I've read this book several times.  Reminds me of a long ago romance in my own life.  I also have the movie, and it's sort of my &#34;It's a wonderful life&#34;, but I like &#34;bridges&#34; so much better.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|At the base, I really do love and enjoy playing this game. AND I like this game more than Temple Run because there are so many different actions, mini games, and more variety in customization for your character. Sadly, and just like Temple Run, the in-app purchases will set you back (at least) $1.99, and as much as $50 for \\"Gru tokens\\" in a single click. They say they have a spending cap... but I wonder what that is....<br /><br />Well it IS a cute game, so if you DO break down and buy your kid a single in-app purchase, just get the \\"golden banana\\". You won't really need the others.<br /><br />Additionally, if your app won't update to the current content version; customer service on their site is excellent. I was stuck at version 42, sent them a note, and the very next day my problem was corrected.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is amazing has really great graphics and guns I truly recommend it to any one who love guns ! It teaches you a lot about guns in the early ages !
B005PK553C|1.0|Not for me, more foe a horror mystery show, the picture looked to be erotic with latex rubber suit but is a house with a slasher in the basement
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Great !great!grea! absolutley, a well received present for my brother, who is also a Trekie fan. Great service and prompt delivery thank you, also good price . AS always thumbs up, would recomened dealer.............
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The writing and plots are outstanding!  The acting is suberb.  I highly recommend it and I am sure that adults will thoroughly enjoy it..
B00594XOZU|4.0|I love it! But there's some flaws like nothing really! Its so fun now i can reach my friends over summer! How cool! You should definitely download this app! Enjoy:)
B008SJH05S|4.0|My son loved them, they are sturdy, they are hard plastic but still in good condition my son (9yrs) Loved them
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love, love, love that series!!  So totally compelling you just cannot stop watching!!  Can't wait for season 4!!!  Get it!
B00BHUB11Y|4.0|This is currently our 2 year olds go to movie, Mickey Mouse has slipped to #2.  The best thing I can say is that after 50 times in the past couple of months, we still find ourselves watching and amused.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Love the remake of this movie and we've seen it at the Theatre several times as well.  I only wish they would remake many more Dr. Seuss movies.  Buy it!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Sometimes fun, sometimes sad, poignant, insightful.  Full of great lyrics and music, all sung by a master of country.  A true superstar.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun. not frustrating. not mindless. engaging and distracting. great waiting room game. would like more games like this!  they are developing more levels. the price is right.
159463176X|5.0|Khaled has such a gift of writing, creating beautiful or sad pictures, really interesting characters that intertwine<br />throughout the book.  It's one of those you can't put down once you start it.  I have read all of his novels and this<br />may be the best.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is just the same as the first book The Hunger Games, when I read this book it was amazing I can't wait to read the final book Mocking Jay.
1878424319|4.0|I have written some of his tips and put them on stickup notes in my bathroom, good reminders<br />of how we should speak and always do our best!
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|So stupid. Yet another case of a crappy remake of the original. Special effects are a poor substitute for bad acting. This focuses more on torture and vamped up background music than an actual plot.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Temple run in New clothes. Still fun. Want to play again and next thing you know it's an hour later.
B00CATSONE|4.0|i loved the book. I have always been fascinated with Tesla. It would be great if you could write another book about him or other less well known inventors.
1932907009|5.0|\\"Save the Cat\\" is a great book! It has great information which Snyder explains throughly enough to understand, but not so throughly that you understand on the first page, but he keeps going 20 more pages. I love how at the end of each section he included a summary and exercises! So helpful! I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in writing screenplays. It is especially helpful if you are trying to sell scripts to Hollywood because he spells out a lot of mistakes rookies make.
B00BQ83VJM|3.0|The book / storyline is great, as is the case with all of Michael Connelly's novels.  The book itself (physical properties) are not what was expected.  I have many of Connelly's books in hardcover & purchased this one as an addition to my collection.  While it was hardcover (as advertised) it was in LARGE PRINT (not advertised) and really doesn't match up with the other books in the collection - DISAPPOINTED!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The scariest tablet game I own, only wish is that there would be a chapter 2? Other than that, one of the best games.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I  HAVE COME TO ENJOY ANYTHING, MOST ANYTHING, WRITTEN BY Baldacci.  This particular book was intriguing, suspenseful, and good enough to keep reading until the end.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This game gave me a hard time but as I spent days playing after work it got easier and the graphics are very good<br />I was looking for another game when I seen this and it looked interesting
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I enjoyed it very much. Good family movie and it was funny . I would tell others to watch it also
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is really neat. I love it. Whoever doesn't love it is Cray Cray. PLZ enjoy the amazing graphics enjoy the different worlds levels and the different versions don't doubt that it's called jewel star if u think by the picture for the app and u think that u will actually get to mine for gems then read the reviews look at the gameplay pics and enjoy the amazing enjoy<br /><br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Your friend ,Limes :) :) :) :) :) :)  &lt;3
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I catch myself playing this at least once every day.  Has more game formations than my lap top which also gets used daily.<br />I must be a gamer at heart.  Tiles could be a bit bigger for these old eyes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's tots fun and I think that all the little minions absolutely tots adorable and they can run sups fast
B005544V6A|5.0|I missed the first seasons of Suits...so I needed to catch up...worth the wait for the DVD 's to arrive<br />.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Really cool but every thing is costing i million gems (extreme emphasis). Even derpy hooves herself wouldn't spend 50$ to unlock a pony. Other than that its awesome. Derpy should be put in the game as a resedent to ponyville because shes super cool.
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|34 years later this is a better movie than it seemed to be in 1979. It is truer to Roddenberry's original vision than any of the other films (I wouldn't call Abrams' movies real Star Trek at all). Still, I wish Amazon would offer Robert Wise's re-cut version, which is a fine film. Watch it and lament the fall of real Star Trek.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great because it does not ask you to buy stuff . I think everyone should buy this game.
B003QS67F0|3.0|Yeah it started great but it got worse and worse and the conclusion was a complete drag. Just my opinion.
1476734941|4.0|It suits me , primarily because it is easy to stick with it.  I enjoyed reading the book and the many hints and methods to keep my resolve.  Only thing, and not a big problem, is the recipes for the fast days.  There are too many unusual ingredients and flavorings for enhancement.  I don't want to buy &#34;strange&#34; spices, etc., and maybe only use them once or so.  But then I'm not put off by simple ingredients.  So I had to adapt for me.  Anyway I've done it and am not bored yet.  I lost 16 lbs. and am delighted.  I shall persevere!!!
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I Don't like giving reviews but I just had too for this album and Band. Awolnation is a precious gem of a band that not many know about but if you understand the meaning behind the music and the positive yet sly undertones I think this will become a favorite for you as well. Aaron Bruno is a great song writer!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Usually I don't buy into overly hyped books, they often are all hype no substance and I end up feeling had. You have had to have lived under a rock not to have heard the hype over The Fault in Our Stars a book so loved Hollywood got into a bidding war over the rights.<br /><br />So yeah I though another overly hyped YA novel and about kids with cancer to boot, nah I'll pass but the it was super cheap this week and so I gave it a go. I sure wish I paid full price. I feel guilty buying it on sale. It's that great.<br /><br />Hazel has lung cancer and she meets Augustus who is in remission for bone cancer at a teens with cancer support group. They strike up a friendship and romance comparing survivor notes and their love of books.<br /><br />They become obsessed over a book and it's non ending to the point that Augustus uses his make a wish on both of them going to Amsterdam to meet the author.<br /><br />I won't give away anymore of the plot as not to ruin this beautiful book. I rarely cry while reading but this book made me cry often. But it also made me laugh a lot.<br /><br />Please don't overlook this perfect gem because it's a YA book or because of the subject matter of The Fault in Our Stars. It was one of the best books I've read this year!
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Sealed play adds tremendous value to the game but having to pay to start new decks is ridiculous and goes against the principle of paying the entrance fee for the software.  I shouldn't have to pay the price of a booster pack to start a new deck...  I would give this game 5 stars without reservation if this were modified to allow users to start a new deck in a slot.  Other then that there some issues installing the software where data is downloaded but the install fails and takes up space on your device.  Normally this would relegate a game to failure status but what is here has me coming back for more over and over again.  You can reinstall the game to free up your sealed slots and I have done so twice now.  Its a hassle but its so much fun that its worth it for me at least.  If u do decide to reinstall for sealed play, remember that your main campaign will be reset ;-).  In its current state this gets a 3 from me as we shouldn't have to jump through hoops to enjoy a game that we already paid for.  Its not like your buying physical or even virtual packs thar you could resell....
B008133MDK|4.0|I can't wait to view more episodes in this Season.  The story lines hold your attention.  The cast are interesting mix.
B00BI745AA|3.0|It was pretty good. The singing was all live so the lack of apparent talent was a bit expected. I thought the overall story was heartfelt and touching. A great story about forgiveness and hardship and honor. I'm just not a big fan of musicals I guess.
1594204217|4.0|This book is quite a personal narrative by the author and draws to a major extent on his own experiences and anecdotes he has picked up along the way.  As is observed quite early in the book, cooking is a defining human activity since we are the only species which cooks - homo sapiens could be viewed as the cooking human.  Cooking  is not just a matter of sustaining ourselves, but it is a very social activity and has developed and changed as society has developed and changed.<br /><br />The author goes on to consider his subject by division into the four ancient elements, Fire, Water, Air and Earth which is a novel way of approaching the subject of cooking.  He looks at how our current approach to cooking has come about, sometimes for economic reasons, sometimes social, sometimes purely practical.  All this narrative is peppered with anecdotal examples of people involved in the process of food preparation.<br /><br />This is not a recipe book, although there are plenty of ideas to pursue should you so wish and there are, at the end, four representative recipes, one for each of the elements.  There is a suggested bibliography for further reading together with suggested sources which the author has drawn upon which may inspire you to read further on the subject.<br /><br />This is an extremely well researched book, which has been thoughtfully and intelligently put together to make it into an interesting compendium.  It will certainly make you think more about what, where and why you are eating.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I love the overall story and it has some hilarious moments but it's over the top for me. Lots of gore, makes you feel terrible for the african american culture in those days and the frontal genital shot of Jamie Fox was anything but flattering.
1451627289|5.0|The funeral of JFK is one of my earliest memories and I've read about the assassination and the various conspiracies.  I was once a die hard King fan and read every book that he wrote for 10 or 15 years.  But I then got burned out, kind of felt that his books were basically the same thing, just different characters fighting some evil force, they win at the end after losing some people that you cared for along the way type of thing.<br /><br />This book tweaked my interest and since it landed under the Christmas tree, I dove back in.  I was hooked within a few pages as I easily fell under King's control again.  An easy read that will get you thinking that has a number of very interesting sub plots within the main story.  I will most likely read tis one several more times over the next few years and it's found a spot on my bookshelf alongside the Stand.  Most of my other King books have been donated to the local library, this one won't be.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to any King fan or anyone with an interest in the Kennedy assasination.
B00COGXX7A|3.0|I guess everyone is waiting for the next great romance. Theres nothing majorly different about this one, it's worth a watch though. Decent show.
B0052GACNM|4.0|But still a nice album to listen too.  I like listening to this one and ones like it when I'm working as background music and this album nicely fills the bill.
B00CWV8X04|2.0|The major negative was how it ends. It simply wasn't believable.. we really enjoyed it right up until we figured out what was going on.. we made a joke earlier in the movie and it turned out to be the truth. Oh well.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|I grew up listening to both of these folks on the radio on a number of road trips across the country and also driving around town.  This album is very easy to listen to and is great background music.  I've listened to it many, many times and have enjoyed each spin.  Both artists are very comfortable with each other and it shows in their music.<br /><br />The only ding against it is I don't think Carole's voice is as good as it was back in the day, it's still good, just not as good.  But it just might be me.<br /><br />If you're a fan of either, this album won't disappoint.  I've recommended this album to other fans and they've thanked me for the recommendation.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|First ran into James' blog when I was a full time entrepreneur. I since failed at 2 businesses and had to go back to the corporate world. After reading this, I am once again motivated to work towards being an entre-ployee. James is pure inspiration. This book not only reinforces ideas that you read in his newsletters and blog but share the experiences of other entrepreneurs who have gone through the same experiences. A must read if you are in a rut or if you need a push to start choosing yourself. Thank you James!
B005DZMODI|4.0|But with these two on it, I was hoping for something that was superb!  It's a nice solid offering, one that I've listened too several times.  However I love both artist and thought this was a cd that I would melt down from playing it too much, but it's not at that level.  A good add for fans of either artist though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome and real easy to use. I'm sure that a 3 year old can figure out how to use it. So get this game it is totally awesome, so you should buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|this would probly be better on big screen i like flying games and would recomend it to some one else
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is an amazing show! Once you start, you won't be able to stop watching!<br />I was a great purchase!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game itself is fun.  But I made a purchase that was supposed to give me double bananas in the game.  I have yet to get this.  I contacted Gameloft support and have yet to get a satisfactory response out of them.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This version is ok, but it isn't as user friendly as the full version. Nice clean picture with good sound depending on your device, obviously. Especially nice for phones.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I LOVED this book!! It was so funny and just so good! I was Tangled up in this book! Cannot wait until the next one!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Beautiful visual images.  Time captured and explained.  To be without time and to take time to enjoy each moment.  A lovely time travel novel.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|This game rocks if you like to use your brain :) I got to a level I'm not sure I can figure out. So this is challenging too!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|What I really love about this app is that you can choose your tones/sound and blend them together. eg- wind, rain, waterfall, chimes, zen and much more... it is simple, easy to use and visually appealing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book had you from the beginning! It was sad, it had funny times and some real times. I would recommend this to anybody!
B0061QD88S|5.0|I chose this rating because I like the Lady and the Tramp DVD. Trusty is funny because he won't admit that he's lost his sense of smell.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a great time being frustrated trying to figure out the clues and getting that door open..it was fun.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I chose this rating because I like the DVD of Sleeping Beauty. I think the three fairies are funny. Thanks.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|THIS Is what movies are best at, covering a wide range of emotions and putting you in someone's shoes that are not easy to fill. Beautiful cinematography and the oldest son gave a convincing portrayal of crisis and the strength of human and divine nature that can overcome the worst moments we face.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I actually bought this game a few days ago and now its the faotd.  I should have waited.  oh well its a really fun game and the best of this type of game ive played.  it was worth the money.
B00A77II0U|5.0|played many mystery games and this was by far one of the best.  loved everything about it.  hope to play more like it.  worth every penny.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|so far this game has been a blast.  it challenges your mind and really makes you think.  Has provided hours of fun.
1594746036|4.0|I bought this book for my 10 year old granddaughter who is an advanced reader.  It's hard finding books that are at her reading level and keep her attention but are not too advanced in content. After she looked at the pictures and found them a bit &#34;peculiar&#34; and scary decided to read it through myself first.  Enjoyed it very much, loved the mystery/fantasy aspect but decided that maybe she wasn't ready to read it as she is prone to bad dreams already.  I'm sure when she's ready she'll enjoy as much as I did!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I like this book, but the author has controversial views on LGBT people that I sincerely disagree with. I would not purchase any more of his books solely because of the views they fund.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great book. Some parts dragged on a bit, but overall, Reacher is a great character and the story keeps you engaged.
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|Liked it, definitely less silly than Bruce Campbell's version; but I still wish he would have made a cameo appearance for old time's sake.  Extremely gory & bloody.  It kept you guessing until the end as to who would be Bruce Campbell's - only surviving (sort of) character.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I mean, honestly, it's the official app. It's just as good as the app is on any device. A little bit smoother than most phones even. The only real grievance I have is how it seems the dev team doesn't update it here very often so you'll get an update after most other platforms. Otherwise it's good.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I had seen the movie and found the book to be more informative than the movie.  It is also written in a manner that one is able to underdtand what he is talking about.  I did dislike the swear words that were included.  It did make me dislike some of it for that reason.  Those words were not needed and explained nothing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A complicated game at first, hope it will get easier as we learn it! Great cartoon graphics and color. Cute!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is highly addictive. Minions are so cute! I always play this game with sounds turned on. Because I love to hear the cute little voices of minions. This is a game for all ages! :D
B00178JDCK|2.0|I purchased this pedal based on other comments.  I can stand the fact that the knobs are too small to use on stage.  All I was really looking for was a less espensive stand alone pedal that I could set and forget.  Just stomp and have a decent reverb sound.  For that part I was pleased.  When used by itself, it perfomes well.  However, when I put it into my effects board with other pedals (I have Ibanez, Danelectro, Dod, etc.) I found that it constantly introduced noise, no matter where in the loop that it was placed.  I tried every thing I could think of to isolate it, but I found that it always adds noise, no matter if it's on or off.  The only way to elimate the noise is to take it out of the chain.  So it's now out.  Too late to send it back, so I guess it's going on Craig's List.  Too bad, because by itself, it works fine.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game... My God, this game. It's just amazing.<br /> As you know from the description, this game is about destroying humanity with one huge epidemic. Already a difficult task, you've got AI, realistic climates, and events to worry about.<br /> For example; Your plague has infected all of humanity. It's just a matter of making it lethal- but what's this? A cure?! The humans already have fifty percent of the cure worked out, and if you don't do something now, you are royally screwed.<br /> A news bulletin pops up; Apparently Justin Bibble has been trampled to death by fans. Eat that, human scumbags! Oh, another bulletin- Iceland has closed its borders and is now taking all that government money and pushing it towards curing your disease. That could be problematic.<br /> So, you go to disease, abilities, and use Genetic ReShuffle I along with Genetic Hardening I and II. The humans are having a harder time now- and your plague has mutated Total Organ Failure. Brilliant! Six million five hundred and twelve dead people later, the world gives up and lets the plague kill them. You have won!<br /> After utterly destroying humanity, you can view your 'score'. How long it took for you to wipe out the humans, how far along the cure was, and an overall rating that ranges from one to five bioweapon symbols. Also, if you beat the 'level' on normal or brutal, you'll unlock the next disease (if there is one).<br /> And, as an added bonus... If you beat the entire game on Brutal- from the lowly Bacteria to the mighty Bioweapon- you unlock everything. All three 'cheats' (Hidden, Unlimited, and Immune plagues), the Neurax Worm, and the Necroa Virus.<br /> If you're finding it nigh-impossible to beat it on brutal, you could always purchase the three cheats and the two bonuses, but that's up to you.<br /> But I'm going off-topic (despite still talking about Plague Inc.). It's a great game with excellent graphics, is very easy to play, and really tests your logic and thinking skills... Oh, and you might find it a bit hard to put down. When I first bought it, I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. I ended up playing it for two hours straight, and didn't put it down for anything. I beat the entire thing on Normal, and now, two weeks later, I'm working towards beating it on Brutal.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Very good movie. It was not predictable, held our attention through the entire movie. Good action scenes as well as interesting plot.
B00CXL6XP0|3.0|Definitely a return to what I originally loved about Queensryche. Darker and heavier than anything they've done in years. Not what I was hoping for, but a step in the right direction. No real great songs, but some good ones.  I'm hopeful for the future of the Ryche!
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|It was a good performance - well done - just did not like the story as well as the first Phantom of the Opera.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Best job in those days of limited technology....Spielberg has always amazed people n he still does that no doubt.... the fat kid is an add on I really wanna know thatall those kids are super stars now
B00CATSONE|5.0|I thought this was a very enjoyable and enlightening read, not only on how we should possibly view Tesla but how we should think about ourselves and our capabilities. I think it was free, well very cheap, and it will therefore cost you nothing or little to learn a little and think a lot... that can not be bad!
B008NF45S2|3.0|It could be the best printer app for your Kindle Fire HD, or it might work to some degree, or not at all. Right now, it prints to my wireless printer from the Google cloud, from websites, and from KF internally stored documents. Along the way, I uninstalled/reinstalled it once, rebooted KF twice, and loaded/unloaded the app 8 or 10 times. And along that way, it sometimes printed certain types of files (e.g., .doc or xls) but not others; sometimes printed from some sources (examples above), but not others; sometimes gave or failed to give various warning messages which were or were not true (e.g., once said I hadn't set up any printers, while displaying my default installed printer at the top of its desktop), etc. Even if it is working perfectly, it prints a generic sans serif font for all docs (not unusual for Android printer apps), regardless of what's in the doc; and it's a resource hog, using 70 MB of my precious RAM. Right now, though, it works fine and I'm glad I rolled the dice for $12.95. I gave it 3 stars because that's the average of 1 star and 5 stars. (And I just discovered that Printer Share-- a somewhat more reliable (if less versatile) printer app I've been using for KF HD-- also now costs @12.95; so that one's a gamble, too. Let the games begin.)
0385040253|5.0|A fantastic reference for all those who are interested in not only the historical knots and their original uses but also how many of them are used in contemporary activities such as fusion and paracord knots.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers I just wish they would give more stuff for free or at least not cost soo much but other than that I love it ;)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter live this game...... it's her life and she luvs horses. And I am glad that this game is kid friendly and even tho my daughter is almost 15 she plays this game and luvs it!! This game is FREE also. Which I luv!
B000HAB4KS|3.0|As we all know, the movie is really great and worth people to watch it for more than one time. But why are there no subtitles! I can't understand some of the dialogues!
B008Y7E912|5.0|Love the movie, cast, and the countryside, cant imagine living back in that time<br />I would recommend this movie to all who like history
B00005JXY3|5.0|One of the only sequels as good as the first. While KK3 didn't quite make the cut, KK1 and KK2 are fan favorites with all members of this household.
B008MM9630|5.0|Very cute and peaceful. Oddly a nice way to relax after a long day.  I love this and definately suggest downloading it!
B006YRVY2G|5.0|I LOVE this cd! The music in the first season was really good, and with this second season grew even better! In season two, the stakes are higher, the games deadlier ad the bond between Sherlock and Watson stronger than ever! This season is also the introduction of Irene Adler made more interesting by the haunting tones of &#34;her song&#34;. Includes the eerie and spine tingling tunes of the Hound. Last, but certainly not least, there is also the heartbreaking melody to Moriarty's manipulations and Sherlock's downfall. Just go ahead and buy this, really.
B008RXYOKY|3.0|This adapter will not work with Thunderbolt drives that are 8TB or greater. It works fine on smaller Thunderbolt drives.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The book takes some wild turns and twists, but it is a clever way to portray the minds and dictatorial  control of the North Koreans.
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|Whenever I play the game it always seems like the enemy can capture points in half the time I can. Also it seems the enemy can send infinite amount of ships without any consequences.
0399162097|4.0|this was an enjoyable book to read, kept my attention, and was not difficult reading. It dealt with interesting ideas. I think i expected it to be a little more of a tear jerker than it was, which is why it did not completely meet my expectations. it handled complex situations without being overly sentimental i guess, which could be a positive or a negative depending on what you are looking for.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I appreciated the author giving life to individuals that may have been forgotten.  The story reminds me of The Lost Boys.  Great read from beginning to end.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|As a reader who was introduced to this series via the television show, I see the necessity of the story. I do understand the initial mixed reviews from exclusively readers of the series, but I believe it's unfounded. The book is very good. It is an introduction to more characters that necessarily expands the story universe. Martin has an endgame, and these characters are obviously necessary for the conclusion of the story.
B001G70M6S|5.0|This film exceeded my expectations (which were already pretty high). The pictures come out beautiful, even in low light.<br /><br />Highly recommend it for anyone who has the camera to shoot this!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Life is precious.  Don't waste a moment on regrets or what if's. Here are the eight more words required to submit the review.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|I was quite impressed with this title.  a little laggy at times, a couple of freezes, but for the price this is a solid quirky rpg for any mobile platform
B001UTW7QU|5.0|awesome Sci Fi show... interesting, intelligent, fast paced, and the last episode of the first season is the GREATEST episode on TV EVER... it will make you cry!... you HAVE got to see it!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I hardly ever write reviews for items and books I buy, but after reading the pages of this book cover to cover I was blown away by what James Altucher had to say. Rather than writing a book full of ups and downs and talking pessimistically about the future of our economy he chooses to focus on the positive future instead. Being a young man out of college, still trying to find his place in the world, Altucher has given me a sort of road map that not even my college professors were able to give to me. This book isn't about easy solutions to becoming rich and famous, but it is about finding the solution to something that I feel we all desperately want, which is freedom. Freedom from our corporate jobs, freedom from our bosses, freedom from and entire economic system that has had most of us in shackles since the day we were born. If you are looking for a book to break free of those shackles, then this is by far the most inspiring and knowledgeable text out there and you should buy it now!
B007THA4FI|4.0|It's not Harry Potter--not even &#34;Harry Potter for Adults.&#34;  Great characters, well developed, and many a great turn of phrase.  I'll read anything by her, now.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Love it!! I've got to  Get back to the game and win my jewels because this little monkey is so cute.
B008NW1M4K|2.0|What ever Hitler did during this 12 years and before was so terrible, that a book like this should never have been written even it is a comedy. It is maybe for people who don't know anything about this time. Who ever liked this book should go to Berlin and see the exhibition &#34;Topography des Terrors&#34; and would understand what I mean.
B00BEIYM42|5.0|Apparently, Amazon isn't aware enough that Vanessa Redgrave and Terrance Stamp, both of whom are unarguably formidable actors and ever so well know to the world movie viewing public, PLAY THE LEAD ROLES. In fact, much ado has been made about Vanessa Redgrave's performance being so superb that it should be an Oscar contender and then some. Not to spoil it, this plot of this movie about music providing a source of calm and healing. Redgrave and Stamp play a married couple. Redgrave the jollier, Stamp a grump. With both of their faces on the front artwork of the DVD it's difficult to fathom why Amazon has buried their names so that when searching under their names (last night, July 18th, 2013) this film did not come up for the sign up for notification of release, or otherwise, at all. I had to search for it under the name that IMDb had for it. Regardless of this major credit oversight, the movie is outstanding and the performances of both leads, Vanessa Redgrave and Terrance Stamp are superb.
B009G7WV5U|5.0|It IS a 180gr. album and it does NOT include &#34;Little Johnny Jewel (Parts 1 & 2)&#34; as mentioned. Nevertheless, timeless piece of art!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|A sweet and light romantic comedy.  Perfect for watching when you don't want something too \\"heavy\\".  The make up artists really deserve kudos for the job that they did on the evolving \\"R\\".
1439153663|4.0|My supervisor read this book and recommended it to me. I am glad I took her advice and got the book and read it. The story takes place on a Virginia tobacco plantation, when a sea-faring captain returns from one of his journies with a very young girl whose parents died on the passage from Ireland. Because no one had paid this little girl's fare, and there is no family, she becomes an indentured servant to this man and his family. She is taken to live in the kitchen house and associates and lives amongst the plantation's slaves.<br /><br />The novel follows this young girl's life as she grows and matures - all the while giving the reader a look into the relationships of the slave quarters, as well as what goes on in the \\"big house.\\" I found the era to be refreshingly different: 1790s to the early 1800's, as opposed to the years leading up to the American Civil War. This gives a bit of a different perspective on what is happening in the country at the time.<br /><br />This novel is interesting and engaging. It does entertain, yet also brings up several issues that may cause the reader to pause and think. However, the characters in this novel have really all been done before: the beautiful bi-racial woman who is simply misunderstood, the elderly black woman who is mother to all, the evil white overseer ala Simon Legree, the doped up white women, the drunken plantation owner who rapes anything that moves. It really is a shame we cannot move beyond the tired stereotypes.<br /><br />While I wasn't thrilled with the ending, it did work for me. Overall, I liked the novel, and found it enjoyable. I only wish the characters could have been a bit more creative and more realistic. Yet, for a first time writer, this is a good read.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|My first experience with Amazon tv - I got this movie. Movie was ok, quality was amazing, no issues with streaming it. All looks perfect! Loved it.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|These books put the 50 Shades series to shame! Hot, hot, hot! I can't wait for the next book in the series. I didn't like the way the third book ended but it left me wanting more of Gideon and Eva!!!
B008J34466|5.0|I think this might be the best Pink cd yet!  Amazing vocals and lyrics!  A great cd for Pink fans or anyone.
B001FB55I0|5.0|I don't understand why people give this film such a hard time. ESPECIALLY considering its predecessor T3 which was smacked around with comedy & beaten to death with CGI that you start thinking to yourself why didn't they just make it into a cartoon. that movie was definitely just a parody of itself and I don't consider it apart of the franchise. THIS sequel however takes a more serious tone  with the story, its packed with great action sequences & filled with good actors like christen bale. Its a great stand alone film. Not as good as T1 or T2 but definitely better than 3 with a different style to it that is still enjoyable to watch. If your a fan its a MUST SEE!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Accurate! Does not drain my battery. Other people say that their battery drains due to the app. This because your device is garbage and need to be upgraded to a better device.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This series is very addicting. I became so involved with the characters I found myself talking to them. However, did you really have to kill off Mathew in the last episode? Sybil at the end of Season 2 and now Mathew? This alone makes me question whether I will be watching Season 4!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Downloaded twice and neither did not work. Once the game opens it starts a second download that failed both times.  I wasted Precious internet time not once but twice just to try this game out and I lost before I started. Don't do it.
B00280LYIC|4.0|A great book. The story kept me glued to the pages and before I knew it I would have to put the book down. I enjoyed the depth of description in characters, I love Greek mythology and suggest this book to anybody with the same taste in books.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I'm not bad with computers.  I troubleshoot and figure stuff out pretty quickly for the most part.  I had problems with syncing, which was the worst problem.  I also never got used to the user controls, they're not intuitive.  Ugh, I've hated nearly everything about this thing from the start.  Just get a Forerunner 305.  WHO CARES HOW BIG IT IS, it's sooooooooooooooo much better than this piece of crap.  I can't believe Garmin put out such different quality products.  I loved my 305 and would trade this garbage plus a bunch of cash to get a new one.  Now I have this paper weight and I have to go buy something else.  I think I'll get a Polar.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have never seen the movie so when i saw the book I decided to read because, it looked like a great movie so I read the book. I think the book was great and I liked all of the stalls and characters in this story. I Loved It!!!!
B002MRRRAA|5.0|I don't need to say much, this is the most epic nirvana concert out there.  Put your diaper on, bring a cooler to the couch and rock out.  The diaper is multi purpose... you'll find out once you try it.  Just take my word for it and wear one.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|It's a Ridley Scott movie.<br />No reference to the Alien creature that started it all until the very end of the movie.<br />Great entertainment.
1451695195|1.0|A narsissistic tone, flat writing style and insisting that his one personal experience, while in a coma, is PROOF if heaven makes this account a thumbs down.  If I was in the presence of heaven, I would be grateful, and humbled that I was allowed to return to this world.  But I get no sense of these feelings from the author.  Also, his explanation &#34;that things were told to me, but without words&#34; seems so unreliable. Just because you sense something, doesn't make it true or correct.  I enjoy hearing about NDEs.  But this wasn't very inspiring to me.  His directions regarding how everone should access their spirituality seemed really condescending, and like he was trying to provide filler for the book.  I would not have this man as my surgeon, or as a spiritual guide.
B00821OX98|3.0|The show is somewhat entertaining but rather predictable. It also contains quite a bit of sappiness and feel-good moments that get old rather quickly. But if you like sci-fi, it has its good points.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a great way to keep my nibbling' s occupied and interested on the train or wherever we are!
0767834739|3.0|This is the second installment in the Resident Evil movie series and yet again it has been overdone. I've been a long time veteran of the games and have been very disappointed with how the directors brought it to the big screen. While the series is action packed and entertaining, the characters and their personalities are smeared all over the floor and they've reached too far to other crowds who probably aren't familiar with the series. After seeing the first film, I was apprehensive but still interested in seeing Apocalypse. I think they did a great job creating Nemesis and he was the best part of this film by far. Unfortunately the side story is mediocre and they totally destroyed all of the Resident Evil 3 characters I played as and loved. Jill Valentine (known as \\"Valentine\\" here) in the game is a cool, collected, smart gal with a pretty good intuition. In this movie she is a macho, loud-mouthed, jealous girl who lacks a warm personality and cusses up a storm. She's like Jill's evil twin sister. Carlos is a likeable character but he's totally an American in this movie. Both Nicolai and Mikhail (they call him something else in the movie) die very early on. Alice has always been exclusive to the film series, and while she is a good actress with an interesting back story, she was never in the games (to my knowledge).<br /><br />The problem I have with these RE films is that they are way overdone - everybody is macho and fights to heavy metal or bad techno. It is totally to sell tickets. None of the characters share the humble qualities of inner strength and determination like in the games. There is no depth to anyone and it's hard to connect. The movie hits hard and leaves no lasting impressions. I keep thinking, \\"less is more\\", but that is not their philosophy - they want it all out on the table and leave nothing up to the viewers to be figured out.<br /><br />Good as entertainment for an hour and a half, but definitely not true to the series, nor does it do the games justice. You must turn part of your brain off and forget everything you know about the Resident Evil games to enjoy this flick.ames justice.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Played Draw Something 2 on I phone.  Much better.  Kindle version,clumsy, I already deleted it. Please upgrade to the second version.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Great companion on a long bus trip. Had me laughing throughout, which caused some raised eyebrows.Highly recommended for a light hearted read.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He watched it weeks ago and continues to rave about this movie.
B007THA4FI|2.0|It took me six months to finish this book after reading the first couple of chapters.  That's actually good, since it took me two YEARS to finish the 5th Harry Potter book.  As in that book, this story stopped me cold -- the characters who were so unlikable, the political bickering, the junkies, the alleged pedophilia, the paranoia -- I'm surprised I actually forced myself to finish it.<br /><br />Maybe it's just that I'm not as enamored with the writings of J.K. Rowling as everyone else is.  I find them boring as hell.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Great revision of a great film. I tend to hate reboots, but this one is awesome. Buy this film now!
B003WJQ74E|4.0|Its a short story book. It is good a good start for new reader. I like it, so do my family too.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|It's a rear lens cap. Honestly I don't know how much you could write about one, but it works just like a rear lens cap should.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Had downloaded the game on my Galaxy S4 and really loved it, so definitely had to get it for my Kindle Fire.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I was actually pretty amazed by the results. Most of my past polaroid experience has been with integral film, and most of the results with that film wasn't good. With this peel apart film I notice that the pictures are much sharper. TIP: Keep the negatives! You can scan them and get much better results than scanning the actual print.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was such a good read! I ordered the whole series and then some! Cassandra Clare is a great writer!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great I love it however it is very addicting. You can't help but play every day and to collect the pieces. Sometimes it's a little frustrating when the pieces Are hard to collect.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|An interesting game that quickly becomes addictive. Fun for a wide age group. They don't expect a monetary gain like other apps, which is appreciated. You can go far without spending money.. I really like that.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I got this game because it was free and I play a lot of different tcg's to sum it up easy to pick up and play , and fun to stomp thru the campaign id recommend it to anyone who likes tcg's
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|This a the worst book in the series which I have love and couldn't put the books down but this one was rushed no real connection with the characters very sad for a brilliant series it's like she was just over it can't believe the publishers let her get away with it
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is a good way to learn English? Nah... I'm not going to lie, i haven't read a single page but looks legit so..
B00760BPOC|5.0|Love love this series couldn't put it down I want more you can imagine and see and smell everything your reading
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love to see all the creative things people come up with! Gets the ideas flowing!!! :) So glad I have it!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I didn't want to read it originally but it was picked by my book club.I enjoyed the depth of many of the characters and even though I was sure their would be closure and connection at the end. I liked that there were plenty of surprise developments that didn't fit a happy ending.glad I read it
0920668372|5.0|I discovered this book during a marriage retreat - I bought it for new parents as a reminder to them that a mother's love is unconditional and forever!!
030758836X|3.0|I'm impressed with the mind of the author to put together such a complex plot. BUT so many books - so little time.  Without a likeable character to be found and a story so grotesque, I wish I'd spent my time on something more worthwhile. I'm not that prudish and even use a little spicy language myself, but I was bothered by what seemed unnecessarily offensive language used much too generously.
B007WDPPK8|5.0|If you want a comprehensive book on knitting in the round, this is a great book! I have been knitting with circular needles for years and like many, I just started using them. There are so many tricks and tips in this book. A great reference book for all your circular knitting needs and it also has projects to help you learn.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|The story, acting and beauty of this series makes watching it a pleasure.  Each character<br />is developed carefully, showcasing the very best and very worst of what it is to be human -- and<br />especially how we endure and go on, in spite of what life tosses us.  Also a great study of<br />class systems, judgement, prejudice, and self-applied pride.  All very very good.
B008Y7IP0S|4.0|I like motivational and action movie. This movie perfectly fits my taste. This is old movie but I still enjoy this movie. The story is well written and I like both the actors' performance.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a REALLY GREAT Mahjong edition.  It keeps you interested because<br />each 'tower' is completed more rapidly than some of the other Mahjong<br />I have downloaded. I find it almost addicting.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is a touching movie to cuddle up to with your spouse that will strengthen your bond with one another. It reminds us to stick with the one you love regardless. Nobody is perfect. A relationship isn't something that spontaneously forms into unison. A relationship is a bond between the two that's built upon a foundation of chemistry and effort in a two-way street.<br />Definitely one to own within the movie collection.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|had read this book before but still enjoyed the genre and the way they all fitted together not my usual style of book but stillliked it
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|One of the best kids movies since Ice Age. Memorable moments with action-packed scenes fill the story. Looking forward to the second being just as good.
B002R88G5E|4.0|thoroughly enjoyed the book had read the others so was impressed with the continuity will read more by the same author.
B008602KQI|1.0|An insult to the book.I hope i never see the movie again. As well as the writers not to onsult the other 2 books.
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|I was not a fan of this movie when I first saw it years ago, but my wife loved it, so I bought the blu-ray. I'm glad I did. The second time through I was better able to appreciate how amazing the plot truly is. This movie makes excellent use of the full color spectrum, creating an animated film more colorful and vibrant than any I can remember. The characters are believable, the setting (at least in animation) is new and interesting, and the villain is unique both in his methods and personality. I now love this film!
0762451319|3.0|The book was a little mini book, tattoos are really nice, the magnets are ok and the necklace pendant is very nice but the chain is very short.  I recommend a different chain is you really want to wear it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|LOVE THE GAME wish all items were available to Kindle Fire users, Spell Shop for instance, it is not easy to achieve the rarer dragons.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book would be a valuable resource for teachers at all levels.  Too many times young people with imaginative ideas are discouraged because others with no imagination dismiss the ideas as impossible.
B004EPZ08E|4.0|Who does not love Jennifer Anniston !!  And the part she plays in this movie is what any fan of Jennifers wishes for :-)
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I thought it would be fun, You always had to download something. Then, when that was down it would turn off that app.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My daughter loves all the Dr Panda stuff.  They are cute, entertaining and not obnoxious.  They are age appropriate. Nothing for parents to worry about except too much time on the kindle.
B004UID2LC|5.0|HAVE TO GET !!! I never pay for song any more. U can go on u tube and download songs, videos, and movies. IT is a have to get app. u will never delete it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this game she's 9 and her 2 year old brother loves to watch the horse and hear it.
0143122010|5.0|This book represented a crowning achievement in research. While lengthy, Pinker does not deviate from his argument that we are living in a less violent world than in the past. This book should be required reading for those concerned about the state of violence in the world, how humans have changed in response to violence, and the contrasts for how violence has changed in the past and the present.
B00CM96A60|5.0|...as to be expected from Mr. van Buuren. I honestly couldn't find a bad track on this record.<br /><br />Also, I highly suggest listening to &#34;Beautiful Life&#34; in the rain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the closest thing to real riding i love it so much!  It iis amazing! My kids love it to
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Naomi Watts is one of my favorite actresses.  The story line is amazing.  The characters line up in a package of emotions unexpected with the timing of a comedian, not at all funny.
B00CO52NLI|2.0|It is a fun app but you have to pay. for ever thing but other then that it was a good app
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This is one of those films made on a budget actors hope to portray a wider range of their talents.  In some areas it delivered, yet was mildly disappointed.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This is a great game that I can play with my 10 yr old grandson.  We really enjoy it, and this way he can't lose the cards again !!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book was slow, and wordy, at first.  Picked up later on.  I would recommend to a friend.  The story was thought provoking.
0718124324|5.0|THE MARCH OF FOLLY is an unfortunate title.  Or maybe not so unfortunate.  Because, after all, what is folly?<br /><br />Barbara Tuchman gives us several examples of the human animal at its worst -- but parading at its best.  From Ancient Troy right up through Vietnam (can a sequel including Chechnia, the former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan be far behind?), we have proved ourselves to be little better than the apes.  If there's a difference, it's only in the splendor of our rebarbative behavior.  Kings, Popes, Ministers, Generals...it's all the same.  And the tragedy?  Invariably, the loss of so many young lives to no real purpose other than to serve the interests of ambition, pride, ignorance, stubbornness -- in short, of vanity.<br /><br />Yes, vanitas, vanitatis.  It's all right there in ECCLESIASTES, and not much has changed.  We are a prideful, belligerent, deceitful, artful, malignant, umbragious -- a word I learned in reading this book -- species.  In short, we're prone to folly.<br /><br />And who pays the ultimate price of that folly?  Our youth.<br /><br />I cannot remember being so disheartened by a book since I read, at a young and impressionable age, A HISTORY OF TORTURE -- or more recently, Martha Gellhorn's THE FACE OF WAR.  If you want to continue believing that \\"all is best in the best of all possible worlds,\\" don't read this book.  If you want to continue believing that we are governed by people who know what's best for us, don't read this book.  If you want to believe that the march of history is inevitable, don't read this book.<br /><br />Ignore my suggestions at your own risk.  But if you don't, be prepared to undertake a life of activism -- and don't expect it to be a happy life.  To buck folly is to question our very essence.  And our essence would appear -- if Ms. Tuchman's major premise is to be believed -- to be tragically farcical.  That, or farcically tragic.  The case of the former President Lyndon B. Johnson in one of this book's final chapters could easily rival that of Shakespeare's King Lear.<br /><br />RRB<br />07/19/13<br />Brooklyn, NYinal chapters could easily rival that of Shakespeare's King Lear.<br /><br />RRB<br />07/19/13<br />Brooklyn, NY
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is one of the most wonderful games I have ever played. I loved it a lot. I reccomend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read all three books and they are all good reads.  Suzanne Collins writings allows a person to actually believe they are part of a story rather than just the reader.
B00628SJJS|4.0|My wife and I wanted our two young teenage children to understand more of what the holocaust was about. This was not a true story in any sense, but did convey much of what happened throughout Europe to Jews.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is a great Bingo game.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Bingo games but beware as it can be quite addicting.
B000FC12SM|5.0|I have read many marriage books that have contributed in some way or another to my marriage.  This one has been the best.  To this day, I still use some of the techniques I learned from John Gray's book.  Top three examples:  the love letter technique, the man cave, and \\"shoe shopping\\" (though I'm not actually a shoe shopper lol).<br /><br />This is one of two marriage books I often give to newlyweds as wedding gifts.  At the other end of the spectrum are my parents who have been married over 45 years and they found this book helpful, too.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Although, for me, it starts off slow, it gets better as it goes on.  By the end I was ready for the next book.  The characters are really being developed nicely, and this book answers questions I didn't even know I had.  Looki g forward to the next one.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|What can you say yet another keep you on the edge of your seat .... Have to agree with Vigor live today tomorrow may never come !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is a really fun and entertaining game. unlike other horse games this one makes you feel like your actually taking care of a real horse of your own. I love the grapics, it makes the game so much mord intresting.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A thrill ride! Easy to upload and view. An excellent value for the price. I would rent it again without question.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|intriguing it kept me interested. not to hard but not to easy. wish it had more levels. please make more levels
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I think this is excellent.  I never watched it when it was a regular program because it isn't the type of program that my wife likes to watch, but I began watching it at night on my Roku box and love it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was terribly engrossing. I can honestly say that I would read anything Flynn wrote. I wouldn't suggest it if you have a weak stomach..
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The writer continues to keep me on edge, as Dexter becomes ever closer to exposure.  Excellent mystery adventure, gotta love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its super easy and fun... the animations in the app r like the movie. I would definetly reccomend this app its great!
193700788X|2.0|I have enjoyed every book in this series, and although last books 11 and 12 were less than the best, this one takes the prize as the WORST SERIES ENDING EVER!<br /><br />The story line is rushed, the plot is so thin it's see-through.  Every possible enemy Sookie comes back to have one last go at her (even the ones you thought were long gone).  As a fan of the series, I am so disappointed, I hope that someday soon I can read a fan fiction re-write of this book that is better.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez is a wonderful, mysterious artist of old that done something so great with his music 40 years ago that it shook the world of the South African Nation's youth movement and helped shape the Country's future with the falling of apartheid. And he didn't even know it. Our United States didn't know it. We didn't even know him, really. But now that his music has surfaced, thanks to the movie: &#34;Searching for Sugar man&#34;, we can certainly see just why his music was so loved over there and how it could have and did move a young culture in South Africa to help inspire them to change the Nation for the better. These songs are moving. They tell stories that are relative to personal levels of our lives as well as much larger, deeper issues that an entire Nation can interpret to being a narration of their political lives. Buy this wonderful album. It along with his other album, &#34;Cold Fact&#34;, will be like finding and possessing two diamonds amongst a handful of CZ's.
159448385X|4.0|I had to read this book for my class assignment. Not too exciting. Amazon is the place to go  if you want to buy an inexpensive used book.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|A hidden gem. Little is known of this man's soul stirring songs until the movie: Searching for sugar man. Great songs that move you musically and lyrically. One can just only wonder how much more he would have done had the American music industry picked him up and pushed his songs to the USA. He could have perhaps been close to Bob Dylan in fame had that happened.
B0063M22QO|4.0|It's a bit. Simplistic, have played only A few games so Don't really know yet.  Am sure  it will be more challenging soon.  Can't really say any more about it
B005F82X48|5.0|I love \\"Icon For Hire\\", with great lyrics that are understandable, both audibly and conceptually. Especially of note is \\"Make a Move\\", which is hard-hitting for its message: \\"Somebody make a move...we all know what's going on\\", how people back away from dealing with problems that are outside of their inner circle of friends and family, from poverty in the US and elsewhere to the Rwandan genocide, and how everyone looks to someone else to \\"Make a move\\", thinking that they don't have to acknowledge problems if nobody else does. Equally good, in a very different manner is \\"Theatre\\" which. like the cover of the album is a great meta-commentary on singers and celebrities in general: how hard it is to be a public figure and what it does to you, and how we're more interested in celebrities when they self-destruct, rather than when they're functional (\\"we're all in on the action, We're all holding our breath, waiting for a reaction).<br /><br />The value of album in a vacuum aside, for some reason this entire album fits perfectly with Season 6 of the TV show \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", with the exception of \\"Fight\\" which fits perfectly with the end of Season 5. Odd, but the album makes a great complement to the show.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy the different challenges in this game, it is never boring.  Even when you think there is nothing more that you can do.
B007HO392S|5.0|This is the best CD yet of Carrie Underwood.  I love all the songs on it.  I am glad I ordered this one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a cool game I like it I recommend you play this game you  Will like it<br />..........
B0064X7FVE|2.0|don't like the new upgrade.  I miss the pollen/alerts new upgrade doesn't have it. what gives with this achiement Icon it now reads 15 on my app. have no clue to what it means.  want the old app BACK!!!!
B00003CXAT|5.0|When I added Jurassic Park DVD to my Wish List, it was 10.99. However when I bought it last week because it just popped up, I bought it for 4.99. Just noticed this a few mins ago. Was still on my Wish List for 10.99. What's up with that?
B00C32R64G|5.0|Another terrific effort from Volbeat. No continuing stories of Cadillac Blood or the Ness family. The new guitarist definitely makes his mark on this album. Yeah, a lot of their stuff sounds repetitive, but they make up for that with catchy riffs and sheer aggression.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|We tried to open it, the video played, then it got stuck when loading and never got to play the acctual game :( Somewhere in all that, there was an error message saying it wasn't connected to the wi-fi.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|You will laugh again and again throughout this movie and find yourself repeating lines from it.  Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise are a perfect pairing as two very different brothers who take an enlightening, hilarious journey together that transforms them both forever.  I love, love, love this movie.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|I wasn't into it at the beginning and then I couldn't put it down. So amazing!!<br />I Highly recommend it!!
B000YABS8E|5.0|I so enjoyed this movie and have watched it many times.  Old fashioned, innocent naivity meets modern, jaded worldliness.  It's an original twist I don't think I've seen in any other movies; and it's delightfully humorous and romantic.  Brendan Frasier is so disarming and endearing as the man completely sheltered (literally) from the ways of the modern world until one day he emerges to find his way in a world he has never seen before, winning over all he encounters along the way.  So sweet it makes you wish you could return to the innocence of long ago. This movie will always be a part of my collection.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|If you go too fast the car flips over.  You need to learn how to coordinate between brake and accelerator.  My experience so far, after 10 minutes of play is that it's simple and mindless.<br /><br />It's actually pretty hard to keep the car from flipping at some of the junctures... and this is a bit frustrating... but overall... the game is is playable, easy to learn, and just challenging enough to keep me interested.<br /><br />*****************************************<br />Review Update.<br /><br />15 minutes later, I discovered that I could redeem points for automotive upgrades.  With better suspension and tires, the car doesn't flip over quite so easily.  More updates = fewer broken necks.<br /><br />One week later, not being able to put the thing down, I can say that I've found the game pleasantly addictive.  There are many stages (which are also obtained by redeeming points).  My personal favorite stage is the MOON.  You can rack up tons of points using the motocross or quad bike in this low gravity environment.  Make a big 'moon jump' and you get enough points redeemable for several upgrades.
B0035S996U|5.0|Have always enjoyed. Watching the Warriors come out and play.... Must see classic if you have not seen it yet.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Again exciting.  I didn't care for this as much as the others by him but still good and would recommend.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Great movie.  It's fun to see the &#34;old&#34; ones winning for a change and having leading roles instead of character roles.  Can't wait to see the sequel.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is is heart-breaking and tear-wrenching. I read for hours only stopping to eat and pee. (gross, I know) It really felt like you were in the book and you knew Auggie.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|The new Soundgarden record King Animal is a magnificent record. It is inventive, progressive, current and modern, highly inspired music, yet feels classic at the same time. It is a marvelously dynamic record that has many  peaks and valleys and it actually feels like an experience from start to finish lyrically, musically and thematically. I had very low expectations for this record and my expectations were literally blown to pieces and I am vindicated as a fan that this band is still a powerhouse of a recording act. I first streamed this record the week before it came out and it was the first time I literally got excited about a band's new record in about 10 years. If this is the last record they ever record it would be tragic because it is THAT good and they seem reinvigorated as a band and actually feel like in contrast to many other bands in their position have a lot more to say artistically and musically. Do yourself a favor and play this loud and in your car or on great speakers to get the full effect. The production and mix are deep and bring out so many incredible nuances after repeated spins.  About 10 of the 13 songs are instant classics and the weaker 2 or 3 tracks have great redeeming qualities as well and are not just filler. BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B006XF5BTG|3.0|There are things that are complicated, but are actually pretty easy to do once you get used to them. And there are simple things that are nonetheless extremely difficult -- like lifting a car. The program laid out in this book is neither simple nor easy.<br /><br />That's interesting, because the author is very, very clear about everything. Indeed, he starts with a rundown of the terms he will be using in the book, and breaks them down to such simple language I almost felt he was doing satire. Nope, he just breaks. things. down.<br /><br />So, unlike pretty much everybody, the author is admirably willing to concede that there's no magic to what he's prescribing, and that discipline and details matter. Then he lays out those details with more than adequate specificity (especially given that he gives you a URL for a downloadable appendix with basically a whole first year of nutrition and workouts spelled out for you).<br /><br />So, the guy is honest, and clearly delineates a program that I feel certain *will* make me spectacularly ripped if I really work it.  But this is absolutely not a diet/exercise program that makes any concessions to simplicity or convenience.  The calories, the carb/protein/fat grams -- all counted and planned out days in advance. The author recommends about 5 hours of lifting a week, and what looks like probably another 3 hours of cardio (preferably interval training). Again, I'm not doubting that this will *work*. I just think that it's not worth it -- my current workout regimen is honest-to-god *fast* (maybe 1.5 hours of gym time a week), and will get me 2/3 of the way to where this workout will get me.  The economists call this \\"diminishing marginal returns.\\"<br /><br />If you want to make getting chiseled one of just a couple central projects in your life, this book might or might not be a good choice. But I doubt that I'm alone in *not* wanting ultra-fitness to have that status in my life, and unless you do, owning this book makes no sense at all.e at all.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Very good series, was very happy at the conclusion. Doesn't leave too much hanging, especially after such a long series.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I am here to say I have read more than my share of &#34;diet&#34;, &#34;health&#34; and &#34;wellness&#34; books. I ordered this book from Amazon just to &#34;check it out&#34;..I was very skeptical....... At the end of the day, every page was like OMG......the lights came on, as what Dallas and Melissa Hartwig write was like &#34;why and how did I not see this&#34;? I also want to make mention that I have been a Vegan (for health and animal cruelty awareness) for over 2 yrs now.  I started suffering with &#34;gas&#34;, added about 10-15 lbs of weight -for which I thought was post menopause and lack of exercise - only to give this Paleo program a try. After 2 weeks, the gas disappeared, the weight is slowly dropping along with the fact that i am not hungry all the time and definitely feeling more alert throughout the day! Amazing how you can stumble upon something......
B00COHAUD4|2.0|I like horror movies that only show glimpses of the monster, or maybe show it at the very end of the movie. This one shows you the monster beginning/middelish, and it kinda takes away the horror. It looked very poorly animated and computer generated to me. Lost the suspense after that.<br /><br />There was also a lot of &#34;really? That doesn't make sense, why is it doing that?&#34; kind of moments near the end. I'm not a big movie buff though, so it could be I just didn't get it. But I hate movies that leave me asking a bunch of questions. =P
B002MG2ATY|5.0|Oliver Stone's Guide to All Things Conspiritorial grabs the viewer by the throat from the very first image and shakes you like a pit bull to very end.  It's a fast-moving, compelling plunge through the darkest underbelly of American life and shadow politics.<br /><br />Not a word of it makes much sense.<br /><br />But it's a great introduction to what has had conspiracy theorists in a mad huff for the past half century.  It touches in an almost encyclopedic way on the unresolved issues regarding the death of John F. Kennedy (which is, pretty much, everything--even where it occurred.  Dallas is, in effect, trying to pretend \\"It didn't happen here\\" in the official ceremonies the city is unhappily planning for the 50th anniversary this November).<br /><br />Don't take Stone's word for it--go dig into the facts for yourself, which is definitely what this polemic will stimulate thoughtful viewers to do.<br /><br />As filmmaking, I hope editors Hutshing and Scalia, who won an Oscar, were paid overtime.  Friends tell me the swirling camera movements in BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD made them nauseous.  But the strobe-like, relentless cutting in JFK could induce an epileptic fit.  To keep this dry, expository, and dated subject fresh and alive, Stone edits the picture like a man on speed.  Some images move so fast that they are virtually subliminal.<br /><br />Does the razzle-dazzle serve a purpose?  Or is it just sleight-of-hand to keep the viewer off-base and unlikely to detect some of the inconsistencies in the barrage of information the screenplay hurls at the audience?  The viewer will have to decide.  There is little time for sober reflection while experiencing this movie.  Just hang on for the roller coaster ride, and try to figure it all out later.  Mr. Stone has assigned the viewer some major homework:  not only figure out the assassination mess, but figure out this movie.<br /><br />As drama, perhaps what works least well are the scenes depicting New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's personal life.  The story casts Garrison as Everyman, encouraging the viewer to share his growing realization that the official version of JFK's death as the work of a lone assassin is bogus.  For us to identify with him, Stone wants us to see Garrison as a regular guy with a loving wife and family (whom he proceeds to ignore as he is drawn deeper into the case). But Garrison, the only person who has ever prosecuted anyone for the murder of the 35th President of the United States, was anything but ordinary.  He was eccentric and obessesed, and in the end, spectacularly unsuccessful in his quest to convict New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw of heading a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.  History has largely dismissed Garrison and his quixotic quest as lunatic.  Stone's attempt to sanitize Garrison into a bland family man and turn him into a national hero simply lacks interest in contrast to the headlong rush of vital importance given to the detective aspects of the story.  The domestic stuff gives the viewer some breathing room, but seems lifeless and dramatically imbalanced by comparison.<br /><br />JFK is nearly unavoidable for anyone who is interested in the assassination, regardless of whoever the viewer thinks did it.  Thus, Stone is probably due kudos--albeit reluctantly--for reframing and revitalizing the debate with his film made 28 years after that tragic day in Dallas.
B000001FY9|5.0|I have many cd's of this guy. I got my cd in perfect shape on time. And after I finish this review I will listen to it again. Thanks for your great service.
B001QB9H1K|5.0|Already had T 1 and 2. Bought my husband this one for Father's Day. Just as thrilling as the others.
B00846REIS|4.0|I read the Fifty shades of grey trilogy my cousins recommended that I read this book so I did.<br />Very good story line pretty straight forward at first Gideon wasted no time to get Eva . Just too much sex in the book but I'm use to it after reading 50 shades the characters aren't perfect at all and that's what gives the book more development love it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I enjoy the details  he uses when he is bringing in a new character to his plots. There are multiple story lines to follow.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book it really shows true character character hope you make more books  I  now know how<br />it feels to be different
B000FC13Y0|5.0|This is a perfect novel.  If this were the only thing Neil Gaiman ever produced, it would be enough to establish him as one of the foremost writers of our age.  That is all.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing. it really seems like despicable me.  I love It. it has a lot of action.I play it all the time.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|OK I agree that this is the best game ever. But Me (soccer312 for MC4 name) and  a guy named phlyo I think we both are very best MC4 players im the best and phylo too. I CHALLENGE GAMELOFT TO A CAPTURE THE FLAG AND I GET TO PICK MY TEAM FROM THE USERS. AND GAMELOFT STAYS WITH THEIR TEAM.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I bought this CD because I really like &#34;Locked out of Heaven&#34; and I didn't want to pay 99 cents for it when I could get the entire CD for $5. It was a great deal when I bought it, and it's a fun CD to listen to. I don't know much about Bruno Mars to compare him to anyone else, but if you like &#34;Locked out of Heaven&#34; and are looking for a deal, you won't be disappointed in this purchase.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I just got my hair cut and wanted to send a couple of pictures to my girlfriend (who lives out of state from me) what it looks like.  I took some self portraits with my Kindle which were hard because you have to press the camera button to take the picture.  Then I was this app and it gives me 10 seconds to set myself up before it automatically takes the picture.  It is just awesome!
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Love this game! A must have for Star Wars and pin ball fans. You have to get this game! You have to get this and experience the thrill for yourself.
B00795P4EG|5.0|I couldn't believe it until I took a picture and used this app to delete something that was in the picture.  I works great!
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|Though interesting, not really what I was expecting of this movie.  It was ok, but nothing to brag about.  Thank you.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I really like the whole transition between Bond getting shot in the beginning and then coming back to save M in the end.
B002AF4Y9G|2.0|This just didn't make sense to me, and was mostly boring as all get out!  The acting wasn't even all that great to me either.  Don't waste your money on this one!
0553384775|4.0|In all fairness, I haven't read this yet, but it fully lives up to its description.  Front cover, back cover, binding, lots of pages with words - it's all there!  And it's sturdy.  Last night I used it to support my plate on my lap while I ate dinner.  Then later I used it to swat a fly.  That's twice that it's come in handy, and I haven't even started reading it yet.<br /><br />I bought the book after watching the trailer for the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio directed by Martin Scorsese.  What can I say?  I love Leo  and Scorsese and I'm an impulsive maniac.<br /><br />When I read the book, I'll update this review.  I sure hope it's as good as that trailer.  It looks like it may take a little longer to read though.<br /><br />Maybe I'll just wait for the movie.
B0006L0LOS|5.0|I love most all of Halle Berry's movies.  She is such a talented actress and beautiful to boot!  She makes this movie a one of a kind!  You will not be sorry you bought this one! :)
B001AW156U|1.0|These things were a complete waste of 6 bucks. They do not work and the quality is terrible. They do not fit properly on the triggers. After getting them on they sit crooked on the triggers and since they don't sit right they also jam the triggers preventing them from returning to the rest position. Don't bother with these cheap things.
B00004YA66|5.0|We enjoy watching this with the kids.  It really shows the love between a Father and Son.  You will not regret buying this one.  Thank you!
B00001W9G0|1.0|The same comment as for Funny Girl -see above. I am returning the disc using a label that I downloaded from the internet
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I watched this 3 times in a row when I bought it.  I absolutely loved the movie and the visuals in it are amazing!  The story line was solid and it's for the old and young both to enjoy!  Thanks
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|brings back so many merories i love this game it is awesome hope you like it i know i do go uno yeah
B000009O8A|5.0|This is one of those, &#34;If you seen one, you seen them all!&#34;  Not much different than others of this nature.
B000MQ54OY|3.0|This was my fault. Without reading the ad properly, I ordered the movie in Blu-ray. I do not have a blu-ray player so I returned it.
6305308659|5.0|I loved this movie.  It really takes you back to the 50's when most things, entertainment wise,  was in black and white.  You will love the way things start becoming colored to everyone.  It's a must see movie.  Thanks
B004VYYA2K|4.0|Really nice toybox for Barbies plus the added features of using the box for imaginary playing.  You can store several Barbies plus clothes, and whatever other Barbie items as well.
B004TLM284|5.0|Britney always shines. This album is just as good as the rest. Her albums always make me want to get up and move.
B004W648Y2|5.0|The story album may have been introduced in 1967 with The Moody Blues' Days of Future Passed, but two albums released in 1969 brought it to full flower. The Who's Tommy and this one came out that year.  Arthur was conceived as a soundtrack to a TV special, very loosely based on the Davies brothers' sister Rose (the subject of Rosie Won't You please Come Home from Face to Face) who had married a man named Arthur Hanning and emigrated to Australia.  As a result, some songs seem stretched out more than necessary (Australia had a long instrumental ending to coincide with the scenes from the special that were supposed to be shown over the music).  the special never got made so the promotion for the album suffered.<br /><br />The album opens with Victoria, a celebration of the queen who presided over the empire on which the sun never set.  Arthur is a retired factory worker who had achieved his life goals: his house and his car.  In Shangri-La it is pointed out that &#34;all the houses in the street have got a name 'cause all the houses in the street they look the same&#34; (similar to the house Ray and Dave Davies grew up in) and Arthur goes outside to polish his car because he has nothing else to do. The workman's paradise the government promised &#34;ain't so happy.&#34;  Arthur has a son who has rejected his values (Nothing to Say) and eventually emigrates to the paradise of Australia where &#34;there is plenty for everyone.&#34;  Yet at the end we see that personal contentment in one's own world is a worthy goal  (&#34;Arthur we see you were right all along&#34; from the concluding song Arthur).  Despite what his son thinks, Arthur emerges triumphant.<br /><br />This is the first album with John Dalton on bass replacing original bass player Pete Quaife.  Dalton used a pick which supplies a heavier bass sound that makes for more flowing lines.  Dave does a lot of whooping an hollering in the background and every one seems to be having a good time making the record.  Dave's guitar work is some of the best he had ever done either when working on a lead or doing a counterpoint to Ray's lead vocals (Yes Sir, No sir).  Mr Churchil Says celebrates the spirt that withstood the Blitz.  Some Mother's Son, inspired by a line in 1968's Wonderboy, catches the sadness yet pride of losing a son in World War I (&#34;They hung his picture on a wall and put some flowers in the picture frame.  Some mother's memory remains.&#34;)<br /><br />A must have for your collection of great rock.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|It's ZZ Top... what is there to dislike!!! Love it love it love it!! The only way to make it better is if they were playing live in my living room!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Game is fun and unique.  The instructions are a little hard to follow, so it takes a while of playing before you know what to do
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|great book. quick read and enjoyed passing it onto my family after I read it.  This books has been taking the rounds.
0783231202|4.0|Played perfectly.<br />Quick Arrival.<br />Would recommend to anyone who needs to write a term paper for a government class.<br />No problems.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This is a smooth and easy read. And since I like both Monty Python and Catch 22, this books satire fits me like a glove. Most of the action takes place in utter space, but this is not a space ship novel, it is all about humor. (And the stings the author generously gives to Star Trek regarding bad scripts and \\"lazy\\" scriptwriters) Scalzis dialouge is hilarious, especially in the first Coda, but funny all through the book. I think I smiled for two days, which is great, dont you think? Buying this book was at least much cheaper than an appointment with my shrink.<br />I found the second and third coda both good and sincere, giving good advise to us all. Dont waste your life doing nothing and love will come around to us who deserves it, which of course means everybody.<br />Enjoy!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Judy like all gameloft games, either take forever to upgrade or spend lots of real life money. Otherwise, not a bad game.
B00CATSONE|5.0|The book has good arguments about IQ, creativity, curiosity and why people mistakenly think that success is due to inherited skills and hence, are out of our control. Although IQ can play an important role in being successful, the author's argument for cultivating things that are under our control is brilliant.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book and learning things I didn't know yet about Tesla and it inspired me to keep trying and working hard in spite of set backs and criticism. It was also comforting to learn that true geniuses look always for ways to improve's other people's quality of life, find ways to keep feeding their curiosity and are pure and loyal to friends, while at the same time not caring too much about fame and wealth (unlike Edison or JP Morgan).<br /><br />Highly recommended book!
B003UYV08E|5.0|This movie was a gift for my son.  He now has the complete set for the Ironman series.  We all enjoy watching these movies.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Its a girl flick and it its one of my favorite movies.  Of course it has a happy ending, its a Cinderella story.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This movie was a gift for my son.  He now has the complete set for the Ironman series.  We all enjoy watching these movies
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|Joel Gray came out with a new book and made me want to see this again.  This soundtrack and movie are NOT on iTunes.<br />Nice interviews with the cast at the end.<br />d
B000FC1192|5.0|This book is same the same concept as the movie but creepier ... I think they did well by changing up the movie to make it more kid friendly.  This is a short read I would recommend ages 10+ it is a bit creepy and kind of teaches us to be grateful for the things you have (and the grass isn't always greener on  the other side) I don't think it is as dark and twisted as some reviewers write either...
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I love it and it keeps me up to date on the new and old music and video's have it on my ipod also.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|I have grown to absolutely LOVE Matt Smith as the Doctor.  His depth of despair, his child like antics,  his deep love of humanity when all seems so dark and lost and his never ending ability to see beyond the surface of someone and push them and himself to be better than....and I thought David Tennant was the end all-well he is, but Matt Smith rose to the occasion and set the bar even higher.  The writing is sublime, but I have to say that of my 3 favorite writers in TV/MOVEIS, two are writers for the Dr. Who Series...best entertainment available...thanks to all that made/make it possible, from the bottom of my heart.
B008J05EL8|1.0|This was and accident I spent my coins on something that I didn't want from the start wasn't for me.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|The ensemble is full of ators/actresses that are top notch. Their timing is superb.  They also know how to wait for the next line so that the previous is not stepped upon.  The vignettes deal with real situations and it's fun to put yourself in their positions.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love watching You Tube you get to see all the funny and crazy video's, and when i'm sad just tune in.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so much fun!!!  love the minions and their laughter!  this game is fast paced and highly addictive!  a must have!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love my facebook can't let it go all my Family and Friends are on FB. I also have grand children.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|The book started out a little slow, but it had it's moments of fast paced scenes. The end though... Khaled Hosseini did great things with the last hundred pages and the ending. I could not of asked for a better ending to this book.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|It really was not for me, gave it a try but didn't like it, I use a lot of other social media.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|This product was exactly what I needed to increase my picture capacity in my 5+ year old digital camera.  I was so happy to have found one since the XD picture cards are no longer readily available.  It definitely met my expectations.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Are you ready to spend hours playing a game???? This is SO addictive!! The courses are great,the animation is hilarious and these Minions are too damn cute!!! Would be nice to be able to get more coins but other than that.....2 THUMBS UP!!!!
B00129H7VS|5.0|It's the best shows about world war II. I already saw it before but I wanted in blue ray. Great metalic cover. Excelent gift!!!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book and it was a fast read.  No as good as the previous 2 books but certianly a worthwhile read.  Just angry that it left me hanging and apparently books four and five havn't been written.  I look forward to the next 2 books.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was a brilliant, complex and yet simple man. He changed the world of technology many times. This book could not have been written any better then it was.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I have 2 grandsons, 2 & 3. years old. They had a wonderful time playing in the pool and I know they would give it 2 thumbs up.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|One of the most riveting and exciting seasons ever it all starts to tie in it will keep you on the edge of your seat
B008JFUNYG|4.0|This movie is a remake/reboot of the Sam Raimi classic. There are plenty of homages throughout to keep a fan pleased as well as new story elements to keep things fresh. The movie isn't particularly scary but it is very entertaining and at time quite disturbing. The film itself is a must see but I feel that the dvd could use some more extras such as deleted scenes (such as the supposed alternate ending).
B0041D843M|5.0|This book will likely become a sort of &#34;Bible to health&#34; sometime in the neat future. Pretty great. Incredibly thorough.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am level 31and can have up to 43 coins so if I put 4 coins into one round I can go 11 rounds.
0064431789|5.0|You can't go wrong by reading this classic to your little ones!  No matter how many years since it was written, kids love the great drawings of the characters and the wonderful descriptions!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I like to use this app for all my reports it's like the computer version but BETTER, and for some reason I got it for free and everybody else is saying it's 0.99 cents but if you guys have to buy it you should because it's like OK I just looked up and I saw 14.99 I don't know if that's true but I wouldn't buy it for 15 bucks :)
B005LAIII0|5.0|Great movie, the picture and color quality is excellent in Blu-Ray.  The DVD is just as great as it was in the movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Who are the bad guys?  Just about every one.  Is it possible to be a good guy?  Not unless you break the law, your tough enough to survive and clever enough to manipulate your manipulators.  Then your a hero? Yes.  But in more danger than ever!
B000SO7OL6|5.0|In this CD Diana sings some old songs in her own great blues style. Nice music for relaxing on the back porch.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Easy game and keeps you entertained for hours and great for kids plus its free and its easy to upgrade your car's
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A scarily beautiful tale about powers greater than we unsuspecting humans. For an examination of love, friendship, sacrifice, wonder and trust, look no further than here...
B008AK8FHM|2.0|the book it self was filled with neurosurgeons vocabulary that made it difficult to read. I felt like I was reading a medical journal instead of the testimony of eternal life
B009NQZVKG|5.0|You can't get any better than this!  I am simply in awe of Mr. Rollins unparalleled ability and talent to spiral one's physical and mental being into a state of heightened consciousness...right down to the fingertips (when you read this book you'll understand!)!
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I liked the dual stories about two mothers to the same child and all the issues that are involved with that.  The cultural elements were also beautifully handled and I think this author was able to address the confusion that many adopted children experience in wanting to know their birth parents and circumstances but not wanting to hurt the parents who have loved and raised them.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this game and would recommend it if you like a creepy adventure without stress and violence. The G5 games are generally well done and entertaining in my experience.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Even though ive never truely enjoyed games like this, I like this game a lot!! Its simple to understand, challenging, has AMAZING music, and a huge variety of ways to play it! However the multiplayer server list doesn't seem to load. That's the only bug
0399255370|5.0|Love this author and illustrator and this has become my favorite of their work. Tucked this away for my grandchildren and can't wait to read it to them!
0316228532|1.0|Incredibily boring account of forgettable folk.  After the first 10 pages I put it down for 6  months until it surfaced again on my bedside table.  Vowing to see why my pal recommended it, I spent an hour or so slogging through tawdry,dreary,colorless descriptions of characters going nowhere, doing nothing.  Quite perturbed, I skipped to the last 50 pages of the same drivel and felt no remorse in chucking the book.  Don't waste your money or more importantly, your time.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I looked at a bunch of different places for this and they were almost 3 times as much.  Came in great condition and worth the price
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|Hilarious songs, but the kick ass and rock out.  Satchel is a great guitar player in his own right.  Live shows are THE BEST period.  this album is great.  can't wait for the next release.  it won't suck itself, tiger woods, golddigging whore...the whole album kicks some serious ass
081299471X|5.0|This was the first time I've read David Mitchell. Went ahead and bought the rest of his work the day I finished. Was an absolutely stunning piece of literature; so good I limited how much I read a day because I wanted to savor it.
B00BXVKKPA|4.0|high energy songs top to bottom.  right in line with their first two efforts.  good workout tunes to keep the adrenaline pumping
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is very enjoyable and fun for all ages. If you love Despicable Me or if you just love those little minions you'll definitely enjoy minion rush. Have fun :)
B00BURWSHA|4.0|Some rockin tracks, more ballads than the first two albums.  Definitely a similar sound to D. Aldritch's playing in Whitesnake.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love finding new and interesting things and pinterest helps me find them. My favorites are gardening crafts and cooking.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|I've been a fan of Porco Rosso a long time.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because the English language track is a little flat.  It deflates the &#34;over-the-top&#34; outrageousness of the Japanese version.
B00CQGU9GG|4.0|I think my title pretty much sums it up. The re-mastering process, using the original tapes, has made the early albums much more listenable, and are a welcome change from the digitized editions that have permeated the market and classic rock radio stations in the past decades. Not much more to say than that.<br /><br />However, the \\"authentic album sleeves\\" that these CD's come in are pretty flimsy. The common digipak has more structural integrity than these sleeves. But then again, the packaging might be the reason for the lower price.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game! Didn't get bored like I do with other games! Must get this game!!
B00AALX5SI|4.0|I thought Katie did a good job of representing what life was like on tour and it gave me an idea of what kind of person she is. I enjoyed the music and the message of staying true to &#34;being yourself&#34;.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Firstly I will say that I liked this book. The characters were likeable, and the story was engaging. I wish  that finding love shouldn't be so difficult. I think I need a few stories where love comes easier to the characters and without so much baggage. The stubbornness to embrace love gets annoying after a while. The author says that they have much laughter, but the reader doesn't get to hear much of it.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Just started watching this show recently and loved it so I purchased season 1. Stayed up till 3:30 watching the whole thing! Love this show
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really great better than I thought u should really get it for it kids it's just like temple run lol have fun
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|This app is not fun.  It is simple minigame that will keep you occupied for about 30 seconds. This game is not worth the appspace it takes up. DO NOT BUY.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|What an amazing CD. I love sitting in my car driving down the road listening to this CD. The seller got it out to me in a great timely manner. I am very happy with my purchase.
B0012GN3RI|5.0|Album I find myself listening to alot and for 3.99 buy 2 copies and give one to your friend  80s heavy metal all the way no filler blazing guitars high vocals for fans of 80s judas priest a must have
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I loved the Sylvia Day books in the Crossfire series until I got to the end of the third book and discovered that the next book is not even published yet.  What a dissappointment !  I'm not sure I'll get even read the ending because I'll forget what happened in the first three books.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|This is a great movie, fantastic action and incredible animation, a must see for both young and old.  If you like action, sci-fi, technology, this is it
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Now You See Me exhilarated me as I have not been exhilarated by a movie in years.  It even has me giddy, purchasing the Blu-ray and the soundtrack.  The movie is witty, crafty, fun, and wonderfully paced. Woody Harrelson and Mark Ruffalo are awesome; Morgan Freeman is one of my favorites; Mélanie Laurent is tough and savant; Michael Caine is a delight; and Dave Franco is an intriguing treat.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I absolutely Loved this book, it was a positive and moving testimony to loss and recovery!  I Highly recommend it!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry is back with the cold case unit and investigating some unsolved crimes from the LA riots, the dynamic of Harry Bosch is tested. His obsessive nature is in constant conflict with his interpersonal relationships, his daughter, his new girlfriend, Chu, and a new IA agent..... This book is well worth your time and money
098555780X|5.0|Used this book with several online videos to braid some interesting bracelets and knots. I like how the book is broken up by types.
B004LROUW2|4.0|This is unlike any book you've read before or will read again.  Loved the way the story plays out with two story lines occurring simultaneously-made it easy to read...especially given the length of this book!  Worth the time investment.
0802130208|2.0|Maybe I just don't get this book but I can not seem to finish it. I have giving up on trying to read it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Now, THIS, is a page turner with unexpected twists and turns around every corner!!!  Loved reading this book, each character more complex than the next!  Can wait to read Fynn's next two novels!
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|I would recomend this app to everyone. it is a no brainer and loads easily,I use it every day,usually more than once
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Beautifully written novel (and now, obviously, with a movie to boot).  That said, this was not a page turner for me!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|No problems ha  added features and more to play with one  versatility. I  you like magic it worth it on every format
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book made it feel like the series was simply running out of steam.  You almost have to read it if you've read the other two but know not to get your hopes up!
B0081L391C|4.0|I liked this movie. I was not a fan of the tv show, but this was funny and entertaining. I have had a small problem with streaming but it seems to be with roku
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What a great show.  It keeps you wanting more.  I love the stories about the different groups how they come together.
B008JFUNYG|1.0|'You are all going to die tonight... of Boredom.'<br /><br />Where would modern horror movies be without the Japanese, and their irrational fear of their own hair?<br /><br />OK people, I'm gonna say this one last time for the record: Pallid women twitchily crawling around on all fours with their long, lank, stringy black hair dangling in front of their faces are ONLY SCARY THE FIRST HUNDRED OR SO TIMES. Then, after several hundred instances of twitching albino women with lank, black hair dangling in front of their faces relentlessly crawling after you, you kind of need to come up with something else that works. Something that is genuinely original. And much scarier.<br /><br />And I fully expected that the creative minds behind the original 1981 'Evil Dead' (who also produced this film) would deliver the goods. Not to mention that Fede Alvarez, the talented Uruguayan indie film maker, who dropped the nuclear creativity bomb 'Ataque de Pánico!' (Panic Attack!) on an unsuspecting Internet in 2009, is the one in the director's chair.<br /><br />Even without the 1981 original as its progenitor, 'Evil Dead' 2013 still boasts some impressive cinematic bloodlines. So how in Cthulhu's name did this movie not rock the very foundations of horror cinema?<br /><br />OK, I don't demand that horror movies display perfect logic and common sense. Like the David character (Shiloh Fernandez), who creates a WORKING DEFIBRILLATOR out of an old car battery, a pair of syringes, some electrical wiring and duct tape... but this same guy can't kludge together some kind of a flotation device to transport his sister Mia and the others across the swollen, flooded river that has trapped them in the isolated cabin in the woods.<br /><br />When I saw that defibrillator scene, I couldn't help thinking of that 1980s movie parody 'Back to the Beach' in which a character played by Bob Denver (Gilligan from the original 'Gilligan's Island') mentions that he once knew \\"a guy who could take one of these [holds up a pineapple] and one of these [holds up a coconut] and build a nuclear reactor, but he couldn't fix a two-foot hole in a boat!\\"<br /><br />And I'm fine with all that. I don't demand that much from a horror movie, because I realize: hey, it's only a Horror Movie.<br /><br />But I do expect a horror movie ought to generate some genuine suspense and real scares for the audience (me). Why then did this not work? Why is the original 'Evil Dead,' even with its hammy acting and its low budget even by 1981 standards, still better than this big budget gorefest?<br /><br />Well, indulge me a little. Go back and watch the original 'Evil Dead' with its inexplicably swinging porch swing, and its rocking, heaving, steam-belching generator down in the cellar, and its ominous silences and its great use of locations for that 'in the forest at night' creepiness. Or, go back and watch the 1978 remake of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' starring Donald Sutherland, doubtless one of the creepiest, scariest movies of all time. Or watch the 1982 remake of 'The Thing' by director John Carpenter, another true fright-fest.<br /><br />Notice that these films, especially at the beginning, build up fear and suspense by showing you places, things and people that seem ordinary on the surface, but the way they are presented to you in the context of the movie somehow transforms them into something ominous, ambiguous, and spooky. These older horror films restrained themselves from hitting you with the full brunt of the horror too early, and instead let the cumulative effect of all that weird, ominous, ambiguous stuff you were seeing process in your head a little. Get under your skin a little. Maybe get you to paranoically focus on innocent and/or ambiguous surroundings, even get you to see an ominous 'scare' or two in places where the film makers didn't even intend it.<br /><br />Essentially, to get you into the right frame of mind, to where you know the Horror is coming but you're not sure what shape It will take when It finally arrives.<br /><br />American horror author H.P. Lovecraft once wrote, 'The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.'<br /><br />Maybe that's the problem I have with all this. Half an hour in, I already know exactly what it is I'm supposed to be afraid of: a blood-puking female Deadite with yellow contact lenses, who possesses people and makes them attack other people and graphically mutilate themselves. OK, got it. Now what else are you gonna do to scare me? There's still about an hour of this left, and this is all you've got that's gonna scare me? More blood n' guts?<br /><br />All right, I'll admit that Mia (Jane Levy) sells it at first; she appears genuinely freaked out and terrified by what's happening. But then her performance devolves into a B-list retread of the possessed kid from 'The Exorcist' and, while it's clearly no worse than the ham-on-rye performance in the 1981 original, it ain't much better either.<br /><br />The story also suffers after Mia gets possessed by the Deadite, because from there the rest of the movie is like something from the 'Saw' film franchise, except here it's demonically possessed people perpetrating gory, sadistic torments on their victims, and, sorry, that's not scary. It's violent, but not much else. And the movie's climactic scene pretty much imitates every Japanese horror film from the past 15 years. Even some Bruce Campbell inspired, Ash-esque chainsawing at the very end isn't enough to redeem this one from the Pits of Schlock.<br /><br />I thought the film makers could've upped the psychological horror and the drama, by letting the Deadites play with Mia's mind (and the audience's) a bit more, tormenting her with ominous yet unverifiable 'hallucinations' while her four companions continued to insist she's just crazy and junk-sick. Instead, Mia glimpses the demon only once (which just looks like a woman wearing a bloodstained nightgown), and then, a minute later, she's running through the woods, falling down, and getting possessed by the demon and its evil tree-brethren.<br /><br />With a little more effort, the writers could've written a cleverer, trickier story device to compel one of the characters to read from the Necronomicon. Instead, they just made one character sit down and ignore the DO NOT READ! EEEVIIIL! BEWAAAARE! messages scrawled on every freakkin' page, and lazily shoehorned the MacGuffin right into the plot.<br /><br />The creators could've slightly restrained themselves and spent a little more time letting the characters display actual, you know, personalities. They could've thrown in a few more ominous atmospheric touches at the beginning, in order to get the other characters doubting themselves, and each other, and all the while Mia's character is becoming increasingly unstable. They could've used the creepy, wooded locale to good effect like the 1981 original did, but in the 2013 version, the forest is more or less out of the picture.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they squandered these opportunities, and ultimately they squandered an opportunity to take a classic horror film, rework it, and up the ante a thousand-fold. Instead of supernatural thrills and chills and an atmosphere of genuine suspense, you get a lot of nail-guns, blood-puke and brutal beatings. Not that I mind the latter - it is a horror movie, after all.<br /><br />But without the former to set the tone it's just very gory exploitation cinema, and it carries very little weight in the horror department.
B007SGM084|3.0|I guess with all the hype that it had when it first came out maybe I expected more but I am finding the story line really dry and hard to get through
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really have fell in love with this game.  This is a great game, I can't believe it was free.

B005KDWUFA|5.0|Delivery was speedy and the CD is another wonderful compilation of music.  The variety and quality are superb. I hope they do another CD soon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a really fun game! But I just can't get vector to &quot;die&quot;! Seriously I always die at the part lol
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I'm no movie expert, but it was a good choice for something to watch with my girlfriend on a Saturday night.  Funny (especially the auto-tune part) and it made her say &#34;KIDS MATT.  LOOK, KIDS.&#34;  (she wants some... I keep telling her, after we're married, and then, maybe someday after that...) :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read it in only a day. Heart wrenching with every word but absolutely beautiful story I will not soon forget.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I loved this movie! I'm a horror film fanatic so it takes a lot to make me scared of a movie. No lie, I'm pretty sure I almost crapped my pants at how scary this was! I was even squeezing my boyfriend's hand the whole time. A must see movie and most definitely a must buy!
B0029O08WA|5.0|I'm not really into this series myself, but the books and the music make my grandkids happy and when they're happy, I'm happy.  Good price... good quality and even this Granny could tolerate the music! lol

B00571F26Y|5.0|I was &#34; gluten-free&#34; before reading this book but realized that I wasn't feeling like I should have despite the restrictions.<br />After reading this book, I have now gone wheat free with wonderful results. This is a must- read book!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|The Boy's are back and better than ever.  Looks like a long hot summer of Rock and Roll.  Patrick Stump has that raspy voice that sets the sound for the band.

B005BZQVJ8|5.0|This is the 3rd time I've bought this title, I lost a copy and the most recent copy was literally eaten by my dog! I just keep buying it! I love this movie!
B009WJ44KC|4.0|John Williams has managed to paint a rich and colorful era. This movie score is less demanding of your attention than some of Williams' other scores and that makes it all the more appropriate for the man Lincoln; there is a genuine, humbleness in this score. It is like breathing air from another time. It penetrates. It moves but it never annoys or gets stuck in your head like a wad of gum.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Well written, author knows his material.  There is a great balance of finess, blunt trama, mystery and just plain fun.  It's a good read, I have already bought my next Baldacci book and i would recommend this to anyone that enjoys exciting stories and isn't shy about violence.
B002P79KAC|5.0|Everyone told me to watch this show but I just brushed it off. Finally I started to watch this on TV and became so addicted I had to buy the first 3 seasons on amazon to catch up. I found this show extremely fun and you feel like you are friends with these odd but likable characters. It is a must see!
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I've just finished reading this book after my pre-teen daughter recommended it to me. I'm not getting hung-up over whether it's believable, cliched, or whether it's worthwhile as a piece of literature. Orson Scott Card tells an immensely enjoyable story. The movie starring Harrison Ford & Ben Kingsley will be released in a few months. I'm now eagerly looking forward to seeing if they can do justice to this story on the big screen.<br />I heartily recommended this book to all readers 10 years & older. Wonderful fun.
B000001FLA|4.0|Their are some really good songs; &#34;You Don't Remember, I'll Never Forget&#34;, &#34;Liar&#34;  and &#34;Queen in Love&#34;  kick a**.<br />This is a good cd, get this cd if you are new to Yngwie's style of power metal.
B00136JS12|5.0|It was excellent in the 70's when I first heard it, and remains so.  Definitely worth having in your collection if you are a 70's classic rock fan
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|Ya know I’m watching the original Evil Dead tonight, and I’ve got to say, the original is better.<br />I’m fully aware of how cliché that is to say, but it is but the fact remains that THE Evil Dead is, creepier, more unique, and more memorable than the decent but forgettable 2013 remake Evil Dead.<br /><br />1. The original  has more “unusual” moments, moments that set it apart from anything else on film.<br /><br />2.  It has more of a mood; the harsh white lighting, the fog, the cabin itself.  The low production values in actually give it a look like nothing else.<br /><br />3. Better sound: Scenes like the iconic POV shots, the tape, the crazy unnatural noises the deadites make, the weird ghostly sound that is heard at some level in almost every scene.<br /><br />4. It even has better dialog; and the fact that that dialog was recited by actors who learned their trade by reject actors of the ‘50s somehow made it creepier.  And then there’s Bruce Campbell.<br /><br />5. The cheap special effects actually added something.  We’ve all seen red-colored liquid as blood a billion times; but the original Evil Dead used oozing yellow puss, a milk-like fluid, and I’m pretty sure I even saw cottage cheese coming out of one.  While there isn’t anything inherently scary about cottage cheese; it’s “unusual” to say the least to see it oozing from a human body; and that’s the charm of The Evil Dead.<br /><br />Perhaps my biggest complaint in the new Evil Dead is that they re-make all the easy scenes, but left out the complicated ones; the ones I really wanted to see re-shot with modern technology and a budget.  To quote: “I fear the only way to stop those possessed by the spirits of this book is by the act of bodily dismemberment”  See the original deadites where the horror equivalent of the Terminator;  hard to kill.  In the remake one apparently dies of natural causes!  Sure she had lost a couple limbs and had a few nails in her; but come on, that’s nothing.  I wanted to see the full dismemberment.  I wanted to see the dissolving deadite.<br /><br />The remake wasn’t all bad.  I enjoyed the film; I’ll buy it; it was still better than 90% of the horror films released.  Over all the special effects are more realistic; the actors are better, especially Jane Levy, and the film did have some moments.  But honestly; if it weren’t for the original the new Evil Dead would be entirely forgettable and would show up on Netflix On Demand in a few months.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|I have read all of the Reachers through The Affair. All of them were a treat. Some may be better than others, but not by a whole lot. The Affair is one of the better ones, with a satisfying mix of plot, characters, and action. Lee Child is an excellent writer and storyteller, ranking among the best, such as Micheal Connelly, Ian Rankin, and Henning Mankell. And to top it off is the addition of the short story Second Son to the kindle edition. Second Son is an absolute gem.  gcm

B00AR83PN4|1.0|I downloaded this for the free app of the day and deleted it a few hours later. The concept is interesting since it is going for a &#34;3D&#34; Tetris but wow, is the gameplay slow and boring. The controls are poor and it is almost impossible to see the open spots when a few pieces are placed. Even for free, do not waste your memory.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best game in the world wow I can't believe it the greatest treasure ever found so cool tv is better
B0044XV3QY|5.0|If you liked the movie then this Blu-Ray collectors edition is just for you.  With the extended version you see so much more of the story and it really does fill in some of the gaps from the original release.  A must buy for any fan.
0446580848|5.0|As my title suggests, you really can't go wrong with a John Corey novel, or even with any Nelson Demille book. As always, Demille wrote a fast-paced, brilliant, fun, interesting, twisted tale. Go forth and read.

B005FISBV2|5.0|Watching the first series on Netflix hooked me instantly, so I had to buy this one.  People that do not know the series ask why you empathize with a killer, but this is exactly why people own a pug.  Buying something that horrible does not make sense, but do yourself a favor and start to see Dexter series if you haven't.

B009Y6UCRC|5.0|I'd never heard of Beth Hart until I saw her Kennedy Center performance (&#34;I'd Rather Go Blind&#34;) with Jeff Beck, but I'm now a fan. I suppose Joe Bonamassa does a good job, but Hart is really what this album is all about. The CD version of &#34;I'd Rather Go Blind&#34; is great, and so are Tom Waits' &#34;Chocolate Jesus&#34; and Melody Gardot's &#34;Your Heart Is as Black as Night&#34; (Hart plays very nice piano), but the real surprise for me was Delaney Bramlett's &#34;Well, Well.&#34; A really fun track, and a great album overall.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I enjoyed the first two book immensely. Then when I got to just about the end of the third book it fell apart and I couldn't finish reading it knowing that the author rushed the ending and gave up. The author should be ashamed of herself for such crap at the end of the book. SPOILER: I'm not upset that Prim died. I'm upset that it was written like a dream and that Katniss didn't rush in to kill Snow during the war. I kept reading that chapter thinking it will just be a crappy written dream chapter and she'll wake up on the battlefield and continue towards her goal. Instead we get a bulleted list of events that happend...Coin wins the war, Snow is captured blah blah....<br /><br />Author....YOU. SHOULD. BE. ASHAMED. What a terrible, lazy ending!!!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|If you like this author, you will like this book.  It was unpredictable, fast-moving and fun to read!  I recommend it!

031237674X|2.0|Terrible writing. The arguments made by the author in conjunction with the cases are so simple, it reads a bit moronic to even write it down on paper, much less publish it.<br /> It's like 200 pages of  &#34;I'm Perd Hapley and my name is Perd&#34;.

Just melt your chocolate, spoon it in, tap the thing hard on the counter several times to settle the chocolate and get out air bubbles, put in fridge and in a short while, pop em out and they look amazing!

I usually do it before bed to clear my mind of the day stress.<br />It's a very fun puzzle game especially for anyone who enjoys games such as sudoku.<br />I would have given as 5 stars but with one of the more recent updates the game now requires internet access so I am no longer able to play this well flying or doing other items without internet I am very disappointed as there are no ads or anything else within the game that should require internet.<br />I have this as well as the non color version and do really enjoy both but wish the developers would take off the internet requirement

B00DHNBPA6|3.0|definitely this was missing the sam raimi touch. It wasn't as good as the original and definitely nowhere as fun as 2 or 3. It was decent, and almost there, but it was missing that humor.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel is great as usually, story sort of dragged but still kept you interested to the end a bit far fetched as in not believeable if you have flown an aircraft.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train exposed a whole new period in American History to me.  I had no idea that these children were forced to board a train to the west and were given to people who needed \\"slave\\" labor.  Many of them were terribly abused and many died well before their time because of the uncaring attitude of the people who placed them and the people who took them.  Anytime a placement didn't work out it was the child's fault.  Christina Baker Kline brings this sordid period to life with a wonderful juxtaposition of time and place between the 1920's and 2011.  A wonderful book - a MUST READ!
B00CHMBQRA|4.0|I like polar and spy movies.  I enjoy the good plot, the action and the message.  Since I watched \\"Erased\\" and \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" a few days apart, I can easily compare the two films.  Erased is way better; it is well directed with a plot which makes sense as opposed to all the non-sense in the other film.  The action scenes seem real (no super hero but a normal trained agent), and finally the details are accurate unlike the other film where Tchernobyl seems near Moscow. Bottom line, rent or buy it and enjoy the show.

B00CA3C1N4|3.0|I've seen this game around, and thought I'd give it a try sometime.  Lo and behold, it is offered as a Free App of the Day.  Intrigued, I jumped in and took it for a spin versus the AI, only to be disappointed; maybe playing against friends is a better experience. After all, the developer went to *great length* to make this accessible via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Lan, WAN (Internet) or even on the same device, which is the best thing about this app, and worthy of praise.<br /><br />Still, as a single-player game it falls short on several fronts. The game has a tutorial, of sorts.  It gives you a *couple* of pointers and that's it.  There is no explanation to speak of regarding the mechanics, or really much on how to control the game.  It is rather frustrating to play a strategy game when you don't know the rules of how the game interprets winning or losing.  Furthermore, it can reach a stalemate position which means if you are behind there's no way to win.  Equally bad is being in a stalemate position with no way to lose.  That's boring.  Of course, you can end at any time, so the moment you are winning you can stop the game and boost your stats.  That means that the stats on the leaderboard aren't worth a hoot since they can be 'gamed'.<br /><br />Speaking of leaderboards, it seems your stats are posted whether you like it or not as long as you have network access enabled.  Disturbingly, according to the app each device you use it on is uniquely identified, which I am not fond about.  Smacks of spying.  It gets worse: you can only play this on one device at a time, apparently.  You can 'move' your profile from one device to the other, but it is deleted from the device from which it came.  I'm interested in backing up the data, exporting it to another device, then restoring the data just to see what it does.<br /><br />The app disables the back button, which is irritating.  One screen that really needs to be reworked is the \\"Ability\\" screen.  If you want to go back, you have to \\"Accept\\".  There is no \\"Cancel\\" or \\"Back\\" option, and the back button doesn't work.<br /><br />The game has the IAP permission, but I haven't *YET* seen any in-app purchase requests or ads.  Difficult to trust apps these days, so that's something to keep in mind for future updates/upgrades, after the mass of reviews have been written.<br /><br />The biggest gripe I have is that the instructions or tutorials just aren't sufficient enough.  If the developer adds sufficient explanation, instruction, and/or tutorial I will be glad to bump this up another star to four stars.  But I'm still also concerned that this can only be played on one device at a time, or at least a 'profile' can only be played on one device at a time.  As long as that is the case, this app cannot get the fifth and final star from me.<br /><br />I'd love to give this more stars, so I'm hoping the developer takes this review to heart and makes a few changes; I'm willing to re-review an app if the developer is responsive and communicative.<br /><br />As it is now, it may or may not be worth $2 to the player.

B008K9SG9K|5.0|Imagine Dragons is one of those bands that surprise and delight when you hear a new song. I bought the disc on the two songs I had heard before, &#34;Radioactive&#34; and &#34;It's Time.&#34; Everything on this CD is amazing. &#34;On Top of the World&#34; is mesmerizing with its Caribbean beat and delightful harmonies. This band is sure to amaze you if you give them a try.<br /><br />I'm a 40-something and this really gets my toes tapping. Great road-trip tunes here, folks.

1476734941|5.0|It's been four weeks and I have lost 6 pounds, effortlessly. Once I made up my mind to follow this way of eating,( I hesitate to use the word diet because I expect to follow this way of eating forever), it was easy. I find that if I start the day with a green tea at 7am, I am not hungry and my tummy doesn't rumble until around 10:30-11:00 am. My last meal was finished at 7:00 pm the night before, so that is a 16 hour fast. Then I limit my calories to 500 for the rest of the day. Easy.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this one for my wife after I bought my orange case.  I absolutely believe in these cases.  I have taken it to Lake Michigan, the swimming pool, and the Atlantic Ocean all to have great pictures and videos that will last forever.  The only worry is making the charger clasp a little more lockable.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I saw my granddaughter playing this on mom's I-pad. I had to try it and fell in love with it. Although I have to work out some of the more challenging puzzles on Quadrille Drawing Paper and then try to remember where the connections should be, I love the challenge. Great for all ages. Play for hours on Kindle Fire.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|This kit has most any thing you will need to do whatever it is you want to do. Highly recommend.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Tournament play is even more addictive and driving. My friends and I love competing against each other every week. The constantly changing battlegrounds are inventive, clever and really make you think.
B000IHQTLY|5.0|I bought a pair a long time ago and paid 100 dollars. Worth every penny. I have used these shoes for everything and I am rough on shoes. They have paint on them, epoxy from building my boat and even spark burns from welding and they still have held up great. When I saw this price I jumped on them. These shoes are comfortable. I have worn them all day walking and hiking feet felt great.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is so awesome I have to say it has so much more adventure then the first one you have to get this App
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun little game and a nice way to pass the time at work when it really slow. more words and such
B006VFLIYK|2.0|I have loved David Baldacci's previous works, but this is just bad... really, really bad. It is far too implausible to be enjoyable and there is no part of the story that isn't relevant to the story, which makes it predictable -- if a character happens to notice something innocuous, is is always relevant... which makes the entire world that is described consist ONLY of plot devices... not such a great an idea for a mystery thriller. Yes, it is written well and is exciting, but as anyone that has watched a couple seasons of \\"24\\" knows, when the plot consistently shows that there is always an insider pulling strings, it becomes no surprise when the most unlikely of characters becomes the insider.<br /><br />Honestly, the more I think and write about the book, the more upset I get for having wasted my time.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|A fun, fantasy, historical fiction epic.  I had to do some online reading to straighten out all the characters, but all-in-all, very enjoyable!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I just couldn't put it down. One of the best science fiction books I've read in years. Clever format, amusing, exciting, engrossing. I loved it. It's the best deal ever on a book too. I feel like I should find the author and send him some cash in the mail. The only downside is I stayed up too late because I couldn't stop reading.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Great young adult read. Amazing job having the books read as one story rather than separate sequel. It's Very cute.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My kids love the theme song so much that they play it loud all of the time when they turn on the game.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|...and I've used it faithfully every day since then (over two years ago). It has been flawless and great. Gets the job done and with style allowing you to make all sorts of customizations. If you're questioning whether or not to get it, you won't find a better alarm app. This one has gone with me through 4 different phones -  each time I've been able to copy over my SD card and restore from a backup that you can make in the settings. Makes for easy settling into a new phone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids play this game all of the time.  I had to limit their screen time because they won't leave it alone.
081297381X|4.0|Loved this book.  Love the perspective.  Some of the chapters are longer than they need to be.  While it isn't an easy read, it was really hard to put the book down.  Since reading it, I've been keeping an eye out for positive black swans in life, investing and career.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I was very unhappy with the length and content of the book. The storyline covered in the entire book could be summed up in one paragraph! After anxiously waiting for so many months for the 3rd book, it was a serious let down. I feel very shortchanged!!!!!!😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
B00992CF6W|1.0|I like the game but I try to make an online account with any name possible including vulgar words but even those names are taken

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's a great game

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the Can You Escape game.  Many parts were fun and obvious while others were not quite as revealing.  I am ready for the next level!
B007P7UF06|5.0|This is a great story with fine actors and the scenery in blu-ray is outstanding.  There are many good songs in the movie and it captures the essence of the book from which it was taken, &#34;The Once and Future King.&#34;
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Don't waste your time even though the first two books were good reading.<br />This one, however,  is a big disappointment.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I love this movie. It's a perfect little ones movie. Lots of music, dancing, and just plain fun!! yay yay
B001POX73C|5.0|Impossibly good. That's all I have to say.<br /><br />This book made me laugh out loud untold times. The dialogue is just perfect. The plot moves along at a clipping pace. I must be an extremely traditional romance-novel-reader because I love it when you can cheer for the hero/ heroine wholeheartedly. Yes, at times Jack does seem more dashing-- however the adorableness of the two protagonists makes you jump for joy.<br /><br />This is the most feel good, the most cuddle-up-in-your-armchair of the Heyer novels I've read.<br /><br />Read it immediately!
B000SEI230|5.0|Great read..always love Sparks and his characters.  Laughed & cried. Could not putit down.  Moving, touching, story from page onto the last.
B00014NE62|5.0|Merchant Ivory, as always, created an absolute gem with their production of Maurice. For many of us, the story holds great personal value and meaning coming up in a time (when the movie was released) before one could openly speak of being homosexual. Made with class and superb intrinsic substance, Maurice is an eternal classic.
B001QJUX24|5.0|The VERY BEST John Wayne Western !!! :-) This the most OUTSTANDING westerns that was ever directed by John Ford
1400082773|1.0|Bill Ayers, formerly of the famous domestic terrorist group Weather Underground, really did try as hard as he could to add to encapsulate the birth narrative that Barry Soetoro has been pushing for the last decade. Despite Ayers' hard effort, what little proof and documentation we have of Barry's early life through his 30's dispels nearly all of this mediocre piece of fiction. A much better choice if one is seriously interested in this man's upbringing would be the \\"Dreams from My Real Father\\" documentary.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|He is a poignant and insightful writer who has the ability to capture and hold your interest with every page. He captures the human spirit. I wept as if I had lost my own family.
1451683405|5.0|Sam Harris's short account of one of the longest-debated topics in philosophy and psychology is refreshingly direct in its approach.  Instead of getting lost in the thicket of abstraction and intellectual minutia, this book gives an accessible rendering, with everyday examples and thought experiments for understanding and appreciating the fact that free will is an illusion we have all been conditioned to accept.  Harris argues very succinctly that, though an illusion, though our will is not \\"free,\\" we indeed feel it (therefore it's more \\"feel will\\" than objectively free), and we need not be threatened by the truth of the matter.  Free of the illusion, we can rest in an appreciation of how we each do our best based on what our biology and contextual circumstances allow, and that without blame, we should look to appreciate each others' predicaments as much as possible, though not discounting the pragmatic, daily life need for accountability and redirection of peoples objectively \\"blameless,\\" yet societally destructive actions.  A fascinating, quick read that will leave you thinking (even though you couldn't really \\"choose\\" to do otherwise (and even if you did, you didn't choose that either!)<br /><br />-- Mitch Abblett, Ph.D.  Author of The Heat of the Moment in Treatment: Mindful Management of Difficult Clients<br /><br />[[ASIN:0393708314 The Heat of the Moment in Treatment: Mindful Management of Difficult Clients (Norton Professional)]]
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I really enjoy this game as do my two boys, they are 10 and 4 . It's challenging enough to keep you addicted and still easy enough for a young child...plus the kids get a kick out of the crazy doodles they can make in the game, it's a kind of interaction that's kinda original.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|Dean and Sam.  You love them both and this makes the story unique.  I love Dean's humor.  Sometimes you wish Sam could get even with a win over his big brother.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was completely obsessed with this book. I couldn't stop talking about it or put it down until I was finished. I reacted out-loud when I read a plot twist or generally disturbing revelation. I loved to hate and hated to love every character in this book. I give it 4 stars because I was so involved with this story-line. The ONLY thing I have an issue with is the ending. I wish I could say that I liked it or even if I hated it, but I really am still chewing on it. I understand that it makes sense with the characters flaws and in its own right, it is a brilliant ending because it is still as well written as the majority of the book and it makes you really think and have emotions about what was written. But it is not that clean, nicely packaged ending giving justice to those deserved that we are all accustomed to.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I cannot believe no major network picked this up.  I never heard about supernatural until season 6 when they were running re-runs on TNT.
0345505387|1.0|Did not know it was an entire illustration. Must have missed that in the description. Would not have purchased if I would have known.
B000FP2OPY|3.0|I was unable to turn on the English for hearing impaired.  Disc would not allow English only Foreign writing for hearing impaired.
B00C33M2EE|3.0|I bought this based on the hype and all the 5 star reviews.  Yes, the music is nice and pleasant, but I really wish I hadn't wasted my money.  Maybe I am expecting too much -- I love Philip Glass for example, and classical music, but this seems like the kind of music they play in the background of nursing homes.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|I don't usually like films with sub-titles but this appealed to me and I wasn't disappointed.  A poignant story, well cast and acted.  Even in the direst of circumstances the human spirit can be amazing.  A true love story to the very end.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I just finished building a PC this past May and when looking for parts I decided to get this cuz of my budget and the preformence which is great I mainly use my computer for gaming and it works great

B0053O89RY|5.0|Although its not as funny as the first season, this show continues to bring on the funny.  I loved it
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show has it all. I love that it has &#34;nerds&#34; in their ever-present pursuit of girlfriends (or even just one-nighters). However, some episodes are not appropriate for all viewers - don't let your 10 year old cousin watch...
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was indeed very bad, for Violet, Klaus, and Sunny of course! The Bad Beginning was very interesting and full of strange twists and turns. Count Olaf is an evil man who the three siblings are forced to live with after thier parents died in a mysterious fire... It was very shocking at times to see what Count Olaf did to the siblings and I am sad to say that their lives only get worse.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|its stupid comedy, but i still like it. I don't usually buy movies unless I find the acting throughout the movie appealing, and it is :-)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I. love the game best angry birds ever made in the world<br /> why not play Intel your battery is deaad
B005FISBTO|5.0|This season is awesome. It takes a religious turn, which keeps asking dexter &#34;is it wrong to kill bad people?&#34;. No, its not.
B0023SDPS6|3.0|I bought this because I saw the television show and wanted to check out this series. Johnson's writing is fine but he tends to hop back and forth in chronology with no real or obvious transitions which is annoying. i still haven't finished it and am not in any rush to do so. In this case, I will not continue with the book series but just enjoy the television show instead.

B0084AXZK0|3.0|The book started out as a page turner, and I am an avid reader so I was enjoying it. But then the pace slowed down and I was noticing that I was literally skipping page after page. It draws on with vivacious detail that can bore the reader. As a teacher, I love the fluid diction and how beautiful the language is, and obviously Wilde is a fantastic writer. But for someone who just wants a good storyline, this took too long to get me interested.
B000L212HC|5.0|I really enjoy this movie (which is why I invested in blu-ray) its set at the turn of the 20th century, and is so realistic with great acting!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is really the perfect name for the relationship that blossoms between the two main characters, Abby and Travis. This novel takes you through every possible emotion within a single scene, and these constant highs and lows keep you completely hooked until the end. I literally could not put this book down (I tried so hard!) and easily fell for the crazy charm that is Travis Maddox. Great book!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Having a blast trying to make it to the next room. It makes for a great time killer when there is nothing to do.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|This movie was good. Interesting. The effects were OK. The storyline was nice. It is worth paying to watch it at home with a loved one.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|I had read a lot of internet blurbs about this movie. It didn't disappoint. FX were better than I expected and it was a hoot to watch.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Duhigg's style of storytelling and relating to research was initially a compelling way to engage me as a reader but as I was reading this with a book club I found its appeal wearing towards the end of the book.  This may be attributed to a decline in this style or perhaps because we piecemealed the book over weeks and I missed a deeper research-based style as the author progressed.<br /><br />The book covers habit in several aspects that are interesting (the difference in memory and habits, the habit loop, keystone habits, efforts to manipulate habits to name a few).<br /><br />It was a good, readable book but I think my enjoyment of it suffered at the readership level from the drawn out process in which I experienced it while my enjoyment of it was enhanced by the interaction I had with peers/co-readers who were experiencing it simultaneously.<br /><br />One thing several of us (myself included) found odd was where the book proper ended and the volume of the appendix.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Awesome CD!  Keith does it again!  Love every song on this fabulous and heartfelt CD.  I am truly a Keith Urban fan all the way!
B001AFF25W|4.0|Whether you're dealing with a key growth area in your personal development or brushing up on habits of responsibility I think Brian Tracy's treatment of principles around doing the items you find most odious is helpful.<br /><br />Some of his concepts didn't ring true with me which is why I didn't reach 5 stars on this book.  The parts I found solid and valuable, however, easily outweighed any skepticism I had on some of his ideas.<br /><br />Ideas like &#34;zero-based thinking&#34; and deliberate procrastination, his espousal of the ABCDE method of categorization and prioritization of tasks are approaches that stick out to me.  Of the many items I highlighted throughout the text I like his suggested thought:<br />&#34;What one skill, if I developed and did it in an excellent fashion, would have the greatest positive impact on my career?&#34;<br /><br />If you're working on eliminating a gap in personal productivity due to procrastination; if you experience fear, dread or loathing of some aspect of your work and it serves to prolong the effort or if you're looking to remind yourself of some principles around efficiency, this book is a good investment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|True thinking game! Realistic and<br /> Awesome! Other games can't compare. I would recommend this game to everyone. Can't wait to see what's next.
B006F8HZYK|1.0|I bought this particular edition because of the charming illustrations I had seen in the hard copy. Although this book has all the content, I was completely disappointed. It was described as the illustrated version but there are no illustrations in the book. If you like the illustrations, invest in the paperback. Very disappointed. This only the second kindle book that I was very sad that I purchased.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|An unusual title for an unusual book. I was unsure what to expect from this book, which as I write this, has been listed as a finalist in the 2013 Readers' Favourite annual International Award Contest in the humour category. There's certainly an element of humour in the story and its presentation, and I did laugh out loud quite a lot whilst reading. So, I wish it well in that contest. Comedy isn't noted for its ability to travel, so my enjoyment of the humour, as a Brit, suggests this one has managed that trick rather well.<br />If I say that the book is a `light' crime novel, you might get the idea that it is a different type of book than the one I actually read. There is a deal of the minutiae involved in the lives of the many characters, all of whom are well drawn. Lots of detail and some repetition that describes the people and their lives; many of which are about to be changed. Superficial appearances are shown to be misleading. Love and lust are interchangeable for some of the protagonists here and the element of cheating is not uncommon, giving the whole community a slightly seedy feel.<br />I found myself rooting for some characters, only to discover in later pages that they weren't the innocents I had first taken them for. The pettiness, selfishness, ambition and deceit of the characters come across well, so that their ultimate fates, initially apparently unjust, become almost desirable.<br />There are several surprises along the way in this well-plotted novel. I found myself quite convinced I had the identities of villains and victims sorted early on, only to discover that clever wording had fooled me. I enjoyed the read, even if it was a little longer than might have been absolutely essential. I suspect that the inclusion of so much detail was a way of conveying the very ordinariness of the lives that were introduced, only to then prove that these lives were, in fact, not at all ordinary. A good read that I recommend.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|This album is the last one from our beautiful and talented Whitney.  Several of the songs have vocal glitches that I as a vocalist caught.  But, knowing the consummate professional quality and access to writers and sound engineers that she had, I am sure she left them in for effect and to \\"keep it real\\".  She shines on these tracks.  You can tell that she has gathered the songs she felt best represented her vocal abilities at this point in her career and life.  She has some wonderful partnerships with new artists (Akon) and she also touches several genres - Imma call you tonight has a country twang, \\"This one's for the lovers\\" is nice and easy listening....I just find myself singing along more as I play this album.  Each song is catchy and well written.  Some are definately for the 40 and up crowd, more easy listening, but with some soul to them.  I love this album and especially the ballads.  She starts off with the classic \\"I'm singing this song for you\\" and I could not help but think of Bobbi Christina...it goes into a dance beat which again, I think represents her gift to her daughter...a final insightful farewell from this gifted, talented unmatched phenomenal woman.  We will miss you Whitney, and we will be singing along for many, many years into the future.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|This went from a very good,easy to use app, to an awful mess!  I would not recommend this, unless they change it back!
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|For those who saw the trailer and thought \\"Oh, sweet, a big monster fight movie!\\"  Go see this.  NOW!  You will NOT be disappointed by the giant monster fights.  It outdoes anything Transformers has ever offered on that front.  Seriously, just go see it, you get lots of awesome monster fights.  Oh boy, do you get awesome monster fights...<br /><br />For those of us who saw the trailer with some skepticism on whether a filmmaker even *could* successfully make what basically looked like a big budget modern version of a 70's Godzilla movie, put your fears to rest, this is a movie with more going for it than you'd think.  It has heart.<br /><br />I'm not going to rehash the plot, you know the broad outline and that's enough.  What you do need to know is that Pacific Rim is a movie that actually offers an interesting human message.  In a nutshell, its that people need to stop being victims and work together.<br /><br />The robot pilots work together in teams of two because the machines are so complex that its too much for one mind to take.  So to pilot the big robots, they link minds and share each others memories and thoughts.  This allows them to work the machine, but its dangerous when a person runs across a traumatic memory in the other pilots mind since it can derail the whole interface.  The two main characters are both people with some heavy emotional baggage.  Both have lost people very close to them to these monsters.  Both have to overcome that to work together and fight a greater evil.  Other characters have similar issues.  We see ego clashes, scars from bad parents, terminal illness, and more.  Yet in all of these cases, they manage to overcome their problems and confront their personal demons all so they can team up to fight the actual demons coming up from the ocean floor.<br /><br />Its an interesting metaphor considering ours is quickly becoming a society filled with victims.  So many people do have big problems, big issues, but you don't have to let the past cripple your future, and when you concentrate on how you can help others, you find ways to overcome your own problems.  Its a good message, and thankfully one that's not sledgehammered into your head by the end of the film, all the emotional heavy lifting is handled with some amount of subtlety so at no point does it feel like a big soap opera is going on between monster fights.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect, but most of those flaws don't really matter when stacked up to the big picture.  Pacific Rim is a movie that delivers what it promises, but gives you more than you might expect if you actually pay attention.  Yeah, its a Kaiju film, but how often do we get a big budget, American Kaiju film that not only is very very good, but actually has some heart and some brains?<br /><br />...and to think this movie got beat opening weekend by Grownups 2.  Seriously, people give the Transformers movies billions of dollars but when a GOOD giant robot movie comes out, no one sees it.  *SIGH*past cripple your future, and when you concentrate on how you can help others, you find ways to overcome your own problems.

B008JFUR10|3.0|I actually liked this movie far more than my 3-star rating suggests. For a popcorn movie -- and that's exactly what this is, at the level of \\"Starship Troopers\\" -- it's well worth your $10 ticket. The storyline is formulaic: destructive aliens come to Earth; our only hope of stopping them comes with the Jaegers, a series of super-powered mechanized warriors operated by humans; there's a reluctant hero who suffered a personal tragedy and is dragged back into the fight; another one who wants to avenge their family and isn't allowed to fight; a rival that dislikes the hero; a stoic commanding officer who's hiding something; the nerdy scientist (or in this case, two) who makes a series of crucial discoveries; the dark, villainous person that the good guys have to trust to get what they need; the desperate solution; the heroic sacrifice that must be made to save mankind. There's even a love interest (but only hinted at). And all of this is set against the backdrop of explosions, death and apocalyptic-level destruction.<br /><br />If this sounds familiar, it's because it's been done before many times. And that's the problem I have with \\"Pacific Rim\\": Lack of originality. This movie borrows from so many other films, it'll be amazing if the writers and producer don't get sued. About 80 percent of the film is lifted from the anime series \\"Neon Genesis: Evangelion\\" (fans of that show will know exactly what I'm talking about). There are also elements from the newest \\"King Kong\\" and \\"Godzilla\\" films, \\"Independence Day,\\" \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Transformers\\"; there's even a \\"Power Rangers\\" feel about all of this. And the ending is straight out of \\"Battlefield Earth,\\" with an epilogue that copies \\"Men in Black.\\"<br /><br />Despite all that, the film works. You find yourself rooting for the good guys, even though you know how it's going to end about halfway through the movie. You marvel at the Jaegers and their various capabilities (amazing what the world can build when it stops fighting among itself). The CGI effects are believable (it helps that a good chunk of the film takes place at night); it might even be worth seeing in 3D. So, get yourself a bucket of buttered and a good date, and watch the latest war of the worlds.

B0019NG73G|5.0|What a spectacular Film.  I have read most of the comments printed so far and I must say that I agree with most of them.  Ted Turner (who I can't stand) did a remarkable job in capturing these three days in July.  But I must say that my favorite part is the cannonade prior to Pickett's Charge.  Crank the volume to maximum on your Surround Sound and listen the vibrations bounce off of the walls!  While it isn't even close to the real thing, if you have a top of the line sound system it will blow your socks off.  It sends chills down my back every time I play it.  This is one movie that I would sit 10 hours through if it had been made that long.  Hats off to the USDI for allowing the filming to take place on the original site of the Battle.  A trip to Gettysburg is a must for all Americans.

B008ADSDHQ|4.0|Book 1, in the Harry Hole mystery series<br /><br />It is grand time, for the publisher to give Mr. Nesbo's admirers a chance to see where the series all began. Going into the back catalogue they finally provided us with \\"The Bat\\" his debut novel. Most fans have meet Inspector Harry Hole in the previous novels so it will not be a surprise to see that Harry, the best known characters in contemporary crime fiction has stayed to same old self.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book, filling the gaps in the protagonist biography. It all started in Sydney where he has come to observe and lend assistance on a high profile case, the murder of a young Norwegian woman. It wouldn't have made sense not to get involved in fact it would have made a very boring story. And so the plot has Harry delve into Sydney underbelly working alongside Aboriginal Detective Andrew Kensington. The indigenous culture features prominently and provides an interesting glimpse in the past wrongs committed against the people, at times the narrative sounds a bit too preachy for my taste but nonetheless is quite informative.<br /><br />The pacing started slowly, more a feeling of a travelogue at first but it moved to a brisk stroke mid-way the investigation while Harry must not only fight his own demons but also outwit a sadistic serial killer before he makes a mistake, a fatal error which will come to hunt him forever. Mr. Nesbo introduces an array of red-herrings, twists and violence, enough blood and thunder to have kept me turning pages although I admit wondering where the plot was leading. I needed to pay close attention for this moody and quite fragmented story that kept going back and forth between the murder investigation and Harry's personal side and his past experiences. But everything is kept together by the many interesting characters and by their interactions. Harry has been well developed from the start, a realist that never forgets that his dark shadow is close by.....This is a great series not to miss.<br /><br />\\"The Bat\\" was awarded with the most prestigious crime writing award in Norway in 1997 as well as the premier crime writing award in Scandinavia in 1998.es not to miss.<br /><br />\\"The Bat\\" was awarded with the most prestigious crime writing award in Norway in 1997 as well as the premier crime writing award in Scandinavia in 1998.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone that loved Caressed by Ice and Kiss of Snow. You will not regret it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome it makes you feel like you own your own city and you are making a lot of money.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|So I'm a 5 star reviewer of the first book.  Hot, sexy, oh yes.  The vocabulary is rather impressive.  Christian has some skills both in and out of the bedroom that are quite the achievement and I can see how that is a turn on.  Not to mention he is a billionaire so he can do a lot of things we mere mortals just dream of, but the series went downhill.<br /><br />In book 2, the writing takes a nosedive.  Almost to the point where you wonder if it was written by someone else.  As everyone complains, the same phrases are used over and over.  The sex is overshadowed by the jealous rages.  Her character is dominated by the multiple personalities in Inner Goddess and Subconscious, which in her case should be Subconscience.<br /><br />By book 3, I've put the book down and moved on to a different series.  Literally.  I made it to chapter 4 and took a break.  The writing is so childish I honestly do not believe it is the same writer.  There are no vocab words and instead Hmmmm and Yummy dominate each page.  It's like listening in to a phone conversation with 14 year olds.  \\"No you hang up first\\" and \\"I love you more, no I love you more\\".  We are getting more of a glimpse into why Fifty (which Ana exclusively calls him now) is so dark from those first couple years of his childhood (total BS).  I've gotten about a quarter of the way through the book now and while they have travelled partly around the globe, Ana has regressed to that of a small child.  Her only emotions are fear and \\"sensation\\" which overwhelms her frequently.  Rather than describing Ana as this sex kitten persona, she is now only described as goofy, sappy, playful, or ashamed/fearful.  We experience very little of the different cultures she's in.  None of the great adjectives we looked forward to in previous experiences.  Now things are merely a \\"first\\".  All the things she couldn't wait to see in London were skipped over unless Fifty says it's a first for him.<br /><br />It's disgusting how in less than 2 months she goes from I don't want to be bought and money doesn't matter to me to decribing every single object in terms of price.  Her bikini is $540.  Her bracelet is $30,000.  And yet nothing has color anymore.<br /><br />It will probably take me months to read this book, assuming I finish in the first place.  There are very very few books I've put down and said I don't care how it ends.  Everything I was addicted to in the first book is gone.  Due to all the child like descriptions and fear, it reads more like a cruel rape scene, for pages and pages discussing the marks on her body, than an adult consentual sex scene.  Instead of it being hot and hotter, it's now where you hope the money is worth it.ths she goes from I don't want to be bought and money doesn't matter to me to decribing every single object in terms of price.

0865479186|2.0|I could only get through half of this book before the acid tone got to me.  I'm no fan of homeopathy and found some of his illustrations on the ridiculousness of it to entertaining.  I should have expected that being a columnist for The Guardian his viewpoint might be a bit skewed, but whole pages devoted to class warfare were too much.  I also find that for one so keen to debunk the claims of Complementary and Alternative Medicine that he (from what I read on his website) is a warmist.  I would have expected him to have seen through the philostigen of our time.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Great album, great song writing and great musical elements. It's feel good music, I can't get enough. One of my new favs!

B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love this book for several reasons. I like that the author makes sure to keep the reader always guessing what might happen with the Elite. Who will the prince keep in the competition to become his wife? Even when you think you know something happens to change everything. A great read.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is a very awesome game I enjoyed playing it together with other people around the world and its more fun because I don't have to play with computers I get to play with real people and its really<br />Exciting and smart
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book after I saw the movie and loved the book. There were so many little things in the book that the movie couldn't fit. I definitely recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is very fun. It is cool and it is awesome. I like it more than Subway surfers. Lol
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this app.  I just wish it had more levels than what it does.  I hope to find another similar app on Amazon.  It made me think at times.  Loved the challenge.

B006TF6WAM|1.0|Amazon has obviously started on a new pricing policy, this title and thousands of others are now impossible to buy from Europe, the prices are too high. Some sort of market pricing seems to have been implemented.<br />I get a price of USD 15 for this title, on amazon.co.uk the price is 2.60 pounds, but I'm not allowed to buy from this site.<br />So for now, it's good bye, Amazon. We'll come back when to come to your senses and fire the stupid economy morosn behind this new policy.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the game I guess. Its fine I wish you could go other places in the game besides the dock the rock path and the beginning! So I guess I like it but I would like it more if they just had different things!
B00BYISQTO|4.0|A bit of a different sound from High Violet - maybe a little softer, a little less focus on how deep Berninger can sing.  Continues to grow on me .
B000VHOBQG|2.0|Krystian Zimmerman is a fantastic pianist. His DG recording of the Liszt concertos with Ozawa is magnificent. Ditto for his DG recording of the Liszt sonata, etc. However, his interpretation of the Chopin concertos is so...how do I put it? Well, it's the exact opposite of a straight-forward masculine performance. I find it drastically over mannered to the point where one loses the thread of the music, loses the integration of the piece as a whole, and for me, that kills the music.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|writing so good, story line so unusual, characters well drawn, and conclusion .. could only be that conclusion and satisfactory.
B00CEF014E|4.0|`Solstice' is a blast from start to finish. Damian Stevenson has the ability to make you want to keep turning the page. I wish it was longer but I definitely got my money's worth at 99c. It's sexy but could have been even hotter. I really enjoyed this book a lot. Don't miss the scene with the cat.
B00CATSONE|5.0|a Very good informative book about Tesla and his development in the field of AC electricity - a must read for every electricial tradesman
B00821OX98|5.0|Loved all the action and the characters. This is definitely going down as one of my all time favorite Sci Fi series!<br />However, I don;t like the fact that when it came to go to Season 3, Amazon  wants to CHARGE me after I am supposed to be getting a free month trial here! I do not like the lay out and this website is difficult to navigate. I think Netflix is better as far as that goes and I am sure that eventually they will get Season 3 because I will not be signing up for this after being told that it was a free month trial.<br />This show is great though and has everything!

B00873GRU4|4.0|Be revealing to see if we ever find out where on earth the silos are situated. Interesting how the lower the level, the lower the social strata; heirachy at the top, manual labour at the bottom and how they are kept apart. Considering the technology required to build the silos in the first place, life is fairly primitive. Having to climb a staircase in lieu of elevators or even escalators I guess not only creates a job for some of the population as porters, but discourages people from interacting and questioning their place in society. At any rate, &#34;Wool&#34; raises a lot of problems and questions as to how humans would survive in such a limited environment and for that alone it is an interesting read.

B003OUXECE|4.0|Written to be read after one has played Bioshock 1 and 2, this novel chronicles what happened prior to the games. It goes into quite a bit of detail regarding character development, but neglects some details about the Big Daddies and Plasmids that I would have liked to learn more about.  Unfortunately, it's hard to explain some elements in video games in a realistic fashion.  Nonetheless, the author did an appropriate job with the material, and obviously demonstrated care for the characters.

B0057GYO9K|1.0|Sounds Brick-Walled to S***.    Seriously guys? Did you even listen to this before releasing it?    A reissue with tons of content I would like to hear, ruined. Joke's on you though since I spent no monies on it.    lololol.    I also have a different vinyl pressing and it sounds fantastic. I knew to stay away from the new reissue because I did my research first.    Nevermind is a masterpiece. It's pretty much the best album of the 90s. Hipsters like to say OK Computer is better because it makes them feel hip and non-mainstream. But OK Computer is just for poofs compared to the shreddingness of Nevermind.    (Purposely starting a flame war for fun.)
B0037QM8YA|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be dreadfully depressing, but I was wrong. It was incredibly uplifting despite having very dark subject matter. The character &#34;Precious&#34; is a joy to watch. I found myself thinking about her story for days after.

What kind of writer kills off such a loveable and noble person just when the reader has fallen in love and knows THIS is somebody to bet on...  Joffrey is despicable.  Tyrian is witty and very human.  Dany, Arya, Sansa, Jon, Bran, Samwell, Gilly, Brienne, Jamie  - all are wonderful to follow.  There are plenty of folks to hate and a lot to be unsure about.  There is a lot of plotting and scheming and secrets getting around to take our heros out without a clue as to who held the dagger that stabbed them in the back.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good action & comedy. Brings back Morgan Freeman, he is the man. Nothing really surprising about the plot, expected results follow<br />the major events.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was, by far, the best movie in the trilogy. I was completely blown away and captivated by this movie. I was lucky enough to see it in IMAX - and this has ruined any regular movie screening that's not in IMAX for me - and it was mind-blowing.<br /><br />This, not the Avengers, should have been the number one movie of the summer. It's complete no-holds-barred acting, directing, action, everything.<br /><br />The cast was excellent - except the addition of Marion Cotillard, whom I adore but who's character wasn't really needed (but was kept in honor of the comics). Tom Hardy is one scary villain as Bane and he is definitely on par with the Joker. He's a villain in a different sense, though. He's darker, more evil and definitely much less fun but no less captivating.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway was superb as Catwoman - so fun to watch.<br /><br />The surprise was Joseph Gordon-Levitt's cop who was as mesmerizing in his cop suit as the rest of the cast was in their elaborate costumes.<br /><br />So many goosebumps and just keeping the audience on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />So many say it's not as good as The Dark Knight, but they are two different stories. Movies are so subjective and these two are both great in their own ways.<br /><br />The one big complaint? - That cop out ending. Trying not to spoil anything here. It would've created a much bigger impact with the way it ended 5 minutes before it really ended.<br /><br />SO many more good things about it that there isn't enough time or space - but definitely one of the best movies of the year. No batman movie - or possibly even superhero movie - could ever match or exceed it's monstrosity, it's depth, it's story. This is Nolan's masterpiece
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This little device is a good deal with more than enough power to chage my energy hungry Blackberry and anything else I've tried tablets, gps etc.<br />A good deal.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|4.5/5<br /><br />I'll start off by saying I really enjoyed the way it was shot. It's Soderbergh's style but I especially enjoyed it in this movie and how a lot of aspects seemed \\"soft\\" visually. Jude Law is very much the key player in this film. Mara is also superb as the most, let's say, surprising character. I do love to see her smile (which she doesn't tend to do often in her movies). Tatum is likable as always. Twist after twist after twist. Even as the good-guy, bad-drug dynamic changed to good-guy/bad-guy, I was always rooting for Mara. Zeta Jones is also flawless as the vulnerable divorcee. Quite a good thriller.<br /><br />An interesting point is made when so many characters in the movie suggest Mara's character go on a certain medication or when people talk about the medication they used to be on. Are we really that commonly medicated as a society? Pop pills to solve all our problems? For example, when Law's character gives his wife a pill to calm her anxiety before a job interview. Hmm.<br /><br />Interesting to compare these everyday dynamics to real life.<br /><br />Also - not to give anything away - I like how the first and last scenes bookend.<br /><br />Shame if this is truly Soderbergh's last feature film.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|great little sharpener. I have a few other similar, and this works as well as them, but I like the added ceramic sharpener. haven't tried the serated file yet. just a little better than a standard sharpener
B00A2H9P98|1.0|Jamie Foxx sucks! this movie sucks! Obama sucks! progressive hollyweird crap!<br />i'm so glad it fing bombed! now Foxx can go work at mc donalds where he belongs!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game for any ages. Perfect for killing time at the airport, road trips, or waiting in line.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|mainly got it to see the various weapons that were used.  People need to learn that head shots on zombies are all that count.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter loves it! She laughs so hard when she is paying this game. It's so addictive also. Very fun
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It's been over 10 years since I've sat die to play magic. After trying out the 2014 edition I was hooked again. So challenging. So fun. Buy this.
B001YV502C|5.0|This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time..  The choreography of the film makers to pull off a lot of these &#34;long&#34; shots was stellar, and the story is amazing as well..  Totally worth the buy...
0385349947|2.0|This book is not for all women, it's for women who are moms. Apparently, if you have a kid, life is easy breezy and you face none of the biases and discrimination faced by women who are moms. For someone who comes off as a feminist, I was disappointed to see her mainly pander to women who are mothers. The child-free movement is growing quickly and largely stems from our rights to chose whether or not we want children. To assume that we all have kids seems counterintuitive to the fundamental idea around feminism.<br /><br />I even double checked the title of the book, it said \\"Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead\\". It didn't say \\"Lean In: Moms, Work, and the Will to Lead\\". So in a sense, Sandberg actually managed to write a book about how women are alienated in the workplace, while alienating a portion of the women who read her book. Well done, Sandberg.<br /><br />I gave it two stars instead of one, because I'm assuming this book is helpful to moms, so it's not a complete loss in the book world.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is so awesome!! you can slap minions. you have 2 boss battles (meena and victor) and to topnit off youbcan customise your own minion!! again. SO AWESOME!!!!!!
B003TXKSWK|3.0|Thought this Cd would be the bomb because I just love his music.  I was never more wrong but worded right.  This CD was a total  BOMB and I don't mean good.  I only enjoyed one selection, Who Do We Think We Are.  Maybe it's the different style that was a turn off.
B000FA5STS|5.0|This book was so involved, with so many twists and turns, I read it twice.  I finished the book, and started it again the very next day!  When I wasn't reading it, I was continually thinking about it.  No other book has ever grabbed me the same way.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|sounds great! comparable to twilight of the gods. and i have to type more words to sumbit this and done!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun and has great graphics. Like temple run in format but it's got way more going for it. You don't have to be a lover of the movie to like the game.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I should have known when I saw that M. Night had directed this it would be awful. He hasn't made a good movie since signs. I am surprised that there wasn't a lame twist at the end just to punctuate how awful a movie this is. I feel bad because Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, but his son, not so much. The whiny, special forces wanna be son is more annoying than anything else. I was rooting for the horrible CGI creatures to eat him and end MY suffering through this movie. I also have a big question, did humanity all of a sudden decide projectile weapons of any sort wouldn't work any more? Or was it some tihsllub bleeding heart message from M. Night that all weapons in the future will be a goofy cutlass instead of (gasp) guns? Really? Elite forces of the future's main weapon against hostile aliens will be a double bladed spear??? Humanity is screwed!!! Hell, half of the problems encountered by Will Smith's son in the movie could have been solved by some good ol' fashioned laser blasts, gun fire, crossbow bolts, arrows, ect... Hey, monsters attacking my mom, boom! dead from a face full of buckshot. Crazy animals evolved to eat humans? I hope they evolved bulletproof skin! Blam! Zap! Giant eagle is now lunch. Crazy tiger creature is a horrible smelling burning pile of ash. A well placed grenade instead of rocks would have made monkey stew out of the feral super apes. Easy peasy! I hope this movie is the end of M. Night's awful movies. He stinks.
B0012GMW34|4.0|these guys are some of the greatest. It does have a bit more swordplay than i like, though. Technically brilliant, but kind of sounds like two guys trying to one up each other.
0470474874|5.0|This book is so much more than I thought it could be!  It is really clear, and would be totally helpful to a beginner, an expert, or anything in between!  I am very picky about software instruction books and this is the best I have ever seen.  If you are someone who is beginning Excel, be sure to have the program open on your computer as you read.  If you are more comfortable with Excel, this book is so clearly written (no, not perfect, but pretty good) that you can pick up a lot just reading it by itself.  This is a book I will take to the office with me.<br />This book is great for Excel 2007, not just Excel 2010.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I love Dr. Who so this was a no brainier at purchasing.  But if you have never seen Dr. Who before and are into sci-fi then this would be a good introduction to the series.  The writing and actors are great.  They carry the story lines well. If you are a Dr. Who fan definitely worth adding to your collection.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I have watched this series many times over.  Joss Whedon really knows how to make characters.  Watch the series before the Serenity movie.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This a good game for kids just not little kids my 5 had some trouble with this game, it entertaining but not really educational,it's good for my little pony fans!
B004GJNFHG|5.0|A guy named Steve McQueen directed this film. He has no relation to the actor.<br />He's the real deal.  Lots of static camera shots that are very interesting and really let the actors and atmosphere carry the story, as opposed to flashy camera moves - except a few times that's very appropriate.<br />An excellent, contemplative film.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Way better than the new one, the Actors were right on as was the Music!! The music was right on for the time, not the crap in the new one and Leonardo vers. Redford, HELLO!!
B008JFUO72|5.0|The best Iron Man yet.  The action was excellent plus the love story part was great.  Can't wait for this DVD to get released.  I can watch over and over again.  I hope there is a #4 as well.  Ending left for a good comeback.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|This app is easy to use and offers you several download options. The video quality is good on my Kindle.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Forbidden Planet came out in March of 1956. What made it unusual at that time was the big budget (several millions of dollars) it was given to film. M-G-M was determined to show that when money was no longer an object a &#34;Space Movie&#34; could be done with intelligence and the highest production values possible at the time. Forbidden Planet is a movie where every single dollar they spent is clearly visible onscreen, during every one of its 98 minutes runtime. This movie also made a star of Robby the Robot, and to this day he remains a cherished icon of the Golden Age of Sci-Fi movies. Use the search engine of your choice and look him up, you will understand why almost 60 years later Robby remains so popular. Forbidden Planet looks amazing on Blu-ray, and I recommend that if possible you see this on the biggest Flat Panel screen available, for maximum effect!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun puzzling but a little short . Just as I was really getting in to your was the end hopefully they add new levels soon  all in all a good game
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I got it for my niece. We went looking everywhere for the CD and couldn't find it. Amazon had it on sale. I downloaded he songs and burnt them for her. So convenient!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I can't even begin to describe how awesome this CD is.  One of the best CDs ever, in my opinion.
B00BU0L882|4.0|I like bizarre horror much more than typical \\"slasher\\" or zombie horror. This collection is extremely diverse and entertaining. I think the reason why not many will be remembered is because of the huge amount of material and not that they are uneventful. There are a few that are absolutely pushing the limits...as mentioned mostly from Japan and Latin America.<br /><br />If you like crazy films like Rubber, or have been exposed to Japanese horror (The Rampo Noir shorts,films like Tokyo Gore Police,etc.)then you will be much more likely to appreciate how these shorts don't hold back. You have to realize that it is hard to tell a story in such short time frame and that many of these are going on pure style and shock value. For unpredictable variety I really can't understand some of these other reviews complaints.<br />Good stuff
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is truly the best app EVER!!! It may not be as good as PC but for me it is just as good.
B00BESM14U|5.0|That was just like my teen years. Amazing! And touching. Really touching. And good acting. I really loved this movie, its soundtrack, and the role that the soundtrack plays in the story line.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|very nice arrangements, great talent, the songs are mostly traditional seasonal songs and well done. Worth the purchase price any day.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new layout seems to be fine WHEN it works.  I can rarely get the app to open and when it does it is frozen on the home page.  I liked the old version better because it worked.  I will be uninstalling weather channel app immediately and try some other app.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|I was a little leery of watching this. It turned out to be a very good movie. I recommend it especially if you like music.
193700788X|4.0|I ordered the last book in the Sookie Stackhouse set in eager anticipation of the end of a series.  When the book FINALLY arrived, they had sent the wrong one.  Imagine my disapointment!!  I contacted the sellar and they were generally polite about sending me the correct book - but the shipping time was still a lot longer then I expected considering their mistake!  I did finally get the correct book - and read it all in one day.  It didn't exacttly trun out how I wanted it to - but it wasn't a bad ending to the series!
B0090X4GLW|3.0|Good quality recording, but a little disappointing. Not always the artist from the movie. I am very happy with three songs on here. But I purchased 12.
B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie because of the slow start.  It caused me to lose intrest and honestly didn't finish it.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I enjoy playing this game.. it has so many levels!<br />I can hardly put my kindle down! I recommend this game.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this game favorite pass time must get now take it from most gameloft games are awesome any way download now and rate it a five star
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this book absolutely addictive.  I was looking for something different to read while I was on vacation and I'm so glad that I found this and downloaded it.  After I finished Book 1, I couldn't put it down until I'd finished the whole Omnibus.  Since I got back from vacation I've already picked up and read 2 of the 3 books from SHIFT and can't wait for DUST to come in August!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|okay so I like the game but I don't like the frequent crashes and bugs. it crashes a lot and when I try to expand my zoo it says that I need to be on level 5(which I am) and need to complete a tutorial but I cannot find it. please fix this problem because I truly enjoy this game.
1563890410|5.0|Thousands of years ago, Morpheus fell in love with Nada, an African princess. When she refused to be his queen, he condemned her to rot in Hell until he deigned release her. In the wake of his imprisonment, Morpheus visited Hell to reclaim his helm of office from a demon who had conned it away from the mortal who stole it from Morpheus. In reclaiming his helm, Morpheus embarrased Lucifer, who swore to destroy him. Now Morpheus has decided that the time has come to release Nada from her torment. Upon arriving in Hell, Lucifer informs him that he has quit, sent all the souls and demons away, and hands Morpheus the key to the now-empty Hell. Now mythological beings from every pantheon are arriving at Morpheus' doorstep, begging, bargaining, bribing and threatening him for the key and the real estate it represents.....<br /><br />As with the previous volumes in the series, Gaiman continues to deliver an absolutely superb reading experience. I really can't praise this series enough....if you know where the story eventually goes, you will continue to see hints that Gaiman has had his endgame in mind from the beginning. I hope to one day aquire these.....
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Took about 1minute, maybe a minute and a half, and my blade was extremely sharp. This little tool is freakin awesome.
B004EPYZTE|2.0|The story line on the original Conan was better than the remake. The only best part of this movie is Morgan Freeman doing the narration. Nonso Anozie and Jason Momoa are good actors. I have high expectations on the Conan series and this one did not deliver any at all It only took me 30 min. to hit Stop.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am very happy with the notes and all the other stuff I hope many people get saved by this or anything the rapture of the church is coming
B003HV0TN2|4.0|I have been off fantasy novels for a while - I read a lot in my teens (Eddings, Feist, Tolkin ...) and then got bored as they all seemed a bit repetitive. Robin Hobb was refreshing and so is Patrick Rothfuss. I just wish that I had checked that all the books have been written as I don't like waiting to find out what happens.<br /><br />My advice would be to wait until 2014 when the next one is out then read them back to back.<br /><br />Rothfuss is a pleasure to read. His characters, imagery and the flow of the novel show a great command of language.  There are twists and turns to the story, and while you have some idea of where it is going, I am really looking forward to the final part in this trilogy.<br /><br />I read Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series afterwards (which I also enjoyed) and noticed quite a difference in the two writers in terms of style - Rothfuss has more depth to his writing.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|The game has seized up and now I read from others that it doesn't work on kindle fire. Would have been nice to know that before downloading.
1401201911|5.0|It´s storie kicks me off of my head!!!! Genius!!!!! Can´t describe without get very excited!!!! The final was just... oh man!!!! This is why love Mark Millar´s stories.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Dowloaded this app just for fun. Although it's a kids game, I'm addicted to it. Each level has different challenges and is fun to play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very very cute there is two different courses and u run with a minion there are different battles u have to overcome for example the vector battle and the meena battle if you like the game temple run or subway suffers I highly recommend this app
B0089LOG02|3.0|Seventeen-year-old orphan Molly Ayers is due to age out of the foster care system when she encounters Vivian Daly, an old lady who turns out to be an orphan herself.  Both have endured difficult placements with undeserving families, and they grow to recognize the similarities in each other's life stories.<br /><br />The greater part of the book is taken up by Vivian's story, which was fortunate for me because I didn't care much for the Molly section.  I didn't find Molly's story to be terribly interesting and the trope of the young person learning valuable life lessons from the old person and in return enriching a lonely life felt a little too pat.  While Vivian's story held my interest, it was a bit melodramatic and I felt that I was able to predict what was going to go wrong in each of her failed placements.  I was unaware of the orphan trains and appreciated that this novel brought them to my attention, but precious little of this story actually involved the movement from which this book takes its name.  Author Christina Baker Kline really had my interest early on, as I was very interested in the workings of the orphan trains and the personalities of the adults who oversaw the children.  However, once Niamh (later called Vivian) is adopted out, we never see the trains again.  A surprise encounter later in Vivian's story strains credulity but seemed inevitable due to the predictable plotting of much of the novel.
B0001I561E|5.0|My twin 4 yr. old grand daughters love the movie. Disney has the habit of putting movies in the \\"vault\\" and then re-releasing them later for \\"new\\" prices. This was nearly impossible to get in a retail setting. I buy all the Disney movies through Amazon.  I bought this used and it has played perfectly. For parents and grand parents: the girls are a little hesitant when it comes to Disney villains. Each moves has one, as you know. A fellow named \\"Jaffar\\" is the villain in this film and he frightened the girls at first, but they quickly got over it.
B0042U94UQ|1.0|The problem I have is delivery takes too long. I ordered it on Jul. 15 and will receive it on Jul. 22 - Aug. 6.<br />Also what's been bothering me is I paid 15.80 dollars which including shipping and handling. I could buy one at any Best Buy store with lower price (I mean less than 15.80) or same price (15.80) and could watch it right away. I know, of course, I have to drive there (any Best Buy store near me) but Delivery takes too long!<br />Now I have to wait.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|If you've ever played Donkey Kong Jungle Climber, you'll feel right at home.<br /><br />One issue I have with the game is when you accidentally press the back button on your phone, the game doesn't go to a pause menu, instead it exits the level you're on.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|The Startup Owner's Manual is a very insightful guide which is packed with practical information. The content is well presented and in many ways reads more like a novel than a text.<br /><br />I feel that anyone considering a business or is involved in a start-up should not simply own this book, but also review it frequently... it is one of the best business books I have ever read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Sometimes the game takes awhile to load, but when it finally does, it's highly addictive and tons of fun. I love this game.
B004I4M0A2|4.0|The app works and indeed helps ,but lagged multiple times. I don't regret buying it, but it's really confusing too I think they should simplify the app.
B005KELW26|5.0|I like the pocket on the left side for notes etc. when using it for book club or Bible study.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|After reading half way, you should know the ending. Is it likely? Confrontation with China wouldn't likely be determined so easily?
0307352153|5.0|Very interesting information, not so much an anti-extravert book as much as stating the sometimes neglected virtues of introversion and it's benefits,
B005EVVESM|5.0|If you love Adam Levine, you'll love this CD. This was my first purchase of a Maroon 5 CD and it will not be my last!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|The only reason I picked up this book is because it is written by J.K. Rowling.  I was warned beforehand to expect something completely different than HP, so at least I didn't have that disappointment.  The sad, disturbing subject matter made it unenjoyable (for me) to read and the awful, selfish characters left me nothing to care about or relate to.  There was a sort of moral at the end, but because of the self-centered nature of the characters, I don't believe that many or any of them would take that tragedy to heart and make real changes in their lives.  I won't read this again and I don't recommend it.
B002TLSSXO|2.0|The same product less the soup ladle is available at Costco for the price of $15.00.<br />That makes this item way over priced.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Read the book in a day could not put it down.  Had read the book before hand and the actors did an amazing job.  This book is so well written I loved everything about it.
