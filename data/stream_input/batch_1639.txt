B003KGBIS4|5.0|As a huge fan of the film, I was blown away with the Criterion release.  AQ/PQ are outstanding!  A pleasure to watch.  Highly recommended.
B0057VDGNK|4.0|Unlike some of the current 80's inspired fashion trends, which are awful & completely unflattering on the human form. This album has the cool of shows like Miami Vice, & is reminiscent of Michael Mann's HEAT, a superior film compared to Drive, with a score that's easily one of the best in this genre of film.<br /><br />While the ultra violence of Drive ruined the film for me, the music is a slice of modernized, best of the 80's cool.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is really easy to use. Very well integrated.<br />This is the only dictionary app worth trying. Helps me on daily basis.
B0088TG252|4.0|The writer of the film obviously agrees that there is corruption in this world, especially in positions of power. Safe house has great suspense. Its one of those movies where time flies by, one action climax after the next.<br /><br />I don't know why everyone thought the ending was predictable. The denouement was predictable. who cares, some critics need to loosen up. there was nothing wrong with the movie, actors did a great job, and i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|so I saw Hello Kitty and I saw FREE so I was like sure, why not! I expected to like this game and I don't...I love this game its simple yet Funn and most of all, it's addictive!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app and it fields my pinterest obsession. however I think a few things need to be added: such as editing pins and pinning from other sites, plus the ability to scroll/load more pins then the current allowed amount. The app has frozen on me a few times but I think it is more of a kindle issue.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|take it from an actual player. this game is awesome. you don't always run out of energy and the possibility's are endless. great game
B002DJSBMA|4.0|great film for its time for sure. ive taken a number of film classes and this film is well directed, produced, acted, written etc. epecially musically written, although old fashioned. for instance when the director is leading the audience to believe that Joe is going to reveal himself when he is saying good by to her; the minor tones brought a creepy feel, to me at least. typical 90's movie.<br /><br />Call me modern but this movie is out of date. I found myself wanting to throw up at times from all the \\"touching\\" moments causing everyone to cry due to happiness. You would thing Death would be more wise and not act like a child since hes been around \\"trillions of years\\"<br /><br />some inconsistencies like all movies especially at the end when the real guy from the coffee shop shows up. hes gonna go back to the party and everyones going to ask him,\\"wheres Bill?\\" c'mon. too corny for me. Great movie for those who like those feel good movies
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book like hunger games provides adolescent level reading with adult level content. It's very insightful about what happens to the human mind and heart when you have to kill another human. It sets the descriptive scene for how wars are waged and continued and the role that politics and government plays in the destruction of humanity. The books are very bloody and harsh and emotionally trying. If you want your teen to be exposed to these things but still have them have meaning and a deeper lesson along with it then these are a great trilogy for them. I read all three books in one week with a full time job and full time school.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I bought it because I love diner dash type games but this is too difficult. you have to pay real money in order to get the help you need and the people are impatient.
1402270275|5.0|PJV Quickie: Bec McMaster delivers a fun, steampunk romp that had me shivering in fear at parts and cheering at others. Honoria Todd and Blade, the Master of the Rookeries are irresistible. If you are a fan of Steampunk, you want to read this one.<br /><br />The elite of London are afflicted with a disease that has them craving blood and almost invincible. They rule over the humans and poorer citizens as Masters, taking slaves and blood donors that are treated worse then dogs. Honoria Todd was once part of the more educated class that served the Lords of London. Her father was a scientist and his studies might have gotten him killed. Yet, while his murderer is unknown, what is known is that the Todds are no longer protected by a patron. Honoria has to take her young brother and sister into the sketier parts of town to live and try to earn a living. Her brother has taken ill and his illness shows signs of a very sinister affliction that she can't even admit to herself.<br /><br />When Honoria finds herself being called in front of the Master of the Rookeries, the area of town she lives in, she knows that her life could very well change drastically. The Masters enslave, kill and take what they want and Honoria can't afford to not obey Blade. She has her family to protect. What she doesn't expect is Blade's almost immediate battle with control when she interacts with him. A man like Blade should be in total control, because the slightest slip could endanger everyone around him. It could be because of the rumors of a vampire killing people in the streets of the rookerie though...or it could be something more carnal.<br />This was a hot novel; with everything a girl like me loves. It had a budding romance, vampires, steampunk and a mystery. Blade was on the hulking, disturbed, sexy side and Honoria was on the untouchable, tough-chick, loyal side that just had all my happy romance check-points covered. Bec McMaster can also weave a great story. McMaster had an intense plot and thick world building all woven into a great novel. My only grumpy moment was the quick, neatly wrapped up ending. It had me all ooey gooey with happy feelings but my rational self was like, \\"that's it?\\" Perfect for a Romance, but it could have been flushed out a tad better. And I have a bone to pick with the cover. Firstly, Ms. Todd would not be in that outfit. Yes, she did have a top hat, but she would not be all showing her stuff on the streets. Second, Blade does not have dark hair. It made me laugh actually. The guy on the cover was hot, but not how I pictured Blade.<br /><br />Overall, a great read and it has introduced me to a great new author, Bec McMaster. I need more! But, alas, `Heart of Iron' is not available until May of 2013. I'll have to wait.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br /><br />Fans of steampunk will not be disappointed. Adults only, this is a romance.<br />The Iron Duke by Meljean Brook<br />YA: The Girl in the Steel Corsett and thick world building all woven into a great novel.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The game was great. Mysterious with some unexpected turns. I had a hard time putting it down. I wasn't. sure I would like collecting evidence on the wall, but I ended up liking it. It helped piece everything together. I don't like hidden object games without zoom but it had it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Book drags for the first few chapters. Then it lights on fire and I couldn't put it down. It's not a chick read, but the ending makes you think about what it really takes to have a perfect marriage.

B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Although the book was better, they did a good job with the movie.  I'm always disappointed when they change something in the movie from the way it happened in the book though, and this movie was no exception.  They mostly followed the story, but did alter some things (with less overall impact on the story, I assume), which makes the book better.  Special effects were really good, too.  Overall, a pretty good job.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It started off as a real page turner. I couldn't wait to read what Amy was up to next. However approx. two thirds through I found that it became very predictable. But I still enjoyed the story.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the first book...and when I read the 2nd book even better.  The author keeps you interested...this is also a romance novel.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This is the first Dr. Seuss story I've even seen and I thought it was great. Good story, great characters, good animation. Voices were excellent and really added dimension to the animation. I particularly liked the characters voiced by Ed Helms and Zac Efron.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I had high expectations when seeing this film and was overly impressed by the end.  FINALLY, a superhero team movie that provides a good script, great all-around acting, and stays true to the original characters in size, shape, and tone.  The heroes are designed the way you see them in the comics and not blown way out of proportion, where so many liberties are taken by a director or studio that it barely resembles the character(s) you've grown to love.  This movie stays true to that concept, for the most part, minus maybe a few costume alterations, like Haweye's costume, etc.  Overall, I was most impressed with how the characters/ actors interacted with each other and how the director & writers found a good balance between dialogue and clashing character styles.  This really brought the movie together for me because it's an action movie but each character is still grounded via his/her individual outlook on where their lives are at the moment.  Because of that, this movie is not just an action flick for the sake of action.  There are many reasons to enjoy this film...THE AVENGERS HAVE ASSEMBLED AND ASSEMBLED WELL!!!!!!

B000UBMWG4|4.0|\\"Blade Runner\\" is the type of film that people seem to either love or hate.  There are those who, like myself, initially did not care for it but later came to like it very much.  Categorically this is a sort of a film-noir detective story set in the near future (2019).  When the film was first released in 1982 it would have been considered fairly far in the future -- 39 years.  The film has a very different style and effect than films such as Star Wars, Star Trek or even Alien which, like this one, was directed by Ridley Scott.  Blade Runner may well come to be seen as being Scott's masterpiece if it isn't already.  There are a few flaws and anachronisms here and there.  A building in the  futuristic city has the \\"Pan Am\\" logo.  Neon displays, which have already mostly disappeared, are seen in store displays along with CRT type televisions, also largely gone now. Coca-Cola signs, as expected, seem to be displayed practically everywhere.<br /><br />Leonard Maltin gives this film a very negative rating in his annual movie book and I, at first, agreed with him.  But subsequent viewings slowly began to change my mind.  It must be said that the first DVD issue of this film was technically terrible.  The color red was misconverged putting practically everything a little out of focus.  This Blu-ray 5-disc issue put that and practically everything else right.  The \\"Final Cut\\" version displays the truly remarkable cinematography and sound recording of this film.  Some of the shots of Sean Young are truly mesmerizing.  In fact the film as a whole in its visual and audible aspects has a sort of hypnotic effect unlike any other film of its type.  Especially effective is the superb score by Vangelis which adds great atmosphere to the visual aspects of the film.<br /><br />I won't go into the complexities of the plot as to whom is and whom is not an android -- in this movie referred to as a \\"replicant.\\"  In addition, the ending of the story was altered by the producers which in itself set off a storm of discussion by fans of the film.  Also, a narration provided in the first person by Harrison Ford in the 1982 version(s) of the film was deleted in the 1992 \\"Director's Cut\\" and \\"Final Cut.\\"  All versions of the film are provided in this extensive set so no one should be disappointed.  This is a very comprehensive and meticulously produced collection.  It is unlikely ever to be improved upon, but then one never knows.tself set off a storm of discussion by fans of the film.

B0044XUZ9K|5.0|I believe it was Shakespeare who wrote, \\"An old man is twice a child.\\" In the past year (thanks in part to the availability of excellent e-publications on Kindle), I've re-read both Huckleberry Finn and Treasure Island. I found both books to be fine examples of children's literature from past times and recommend them for both children and those experiencing \\"childhood twice experienced.\\"

B000031EGV|1.0|I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM, THOUGH I HAVE SEEN IT ON TV. IT IS A GOOD ENTERTAINING MOVIE. I RECOMMEND.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I could not have imagined how timely this book would be when I started reading it. From the first several pages I was in tears. It starts out with so many emotional battering rams, which are quite effective in putting you into the mind of Strayed as her life is more or less destroyed. I considered not continuing because I didn't want to be so emotionally assaulted. I am glad I did continue.<br /><br />I can't really comment too much on the writing. I can't say it was earth shattering in any way. It's Strayed's journey throughout the book, both her journey on the Pacific Crest Trail and her emotional journey, that pulls you in. It's incredibly easy to identify with her. Though I've never been in some a lot of the situations she was in, her desire to find herself and rely on the healing power of nature resonates and inspires. I admire her for deciding to do something as foolish as hiking PCT without any backpacking experience and having the guts to continue. Yes she is often foolish, but it's true what she writes about fear holding us back. We have to imagine ourselves out of the fear to paraphrase. I feel inspired to take a similar journey. I wonder if I could push myself in the way she did, if I would enjoy being alone on the trail. I wonder if nature would have a similar healing effect on me. However, I question that the hike could be so transformative. She doesn't go into much detail of any soul searching thoughts she may have had. It's obvious there was a transformation but I had expected something a lot more profound.<br />flag

1451683405|1.0|Free will is the most often cited factor used by Christians as to why there is evil, disease, and other bad things.  It is also used to justify the existence of Hell, where humans who exercised free will to commit sin are sent for eternity to suffer.  I bought this book in hopes of learning how to rebut that argument, but I'm very disappointed in Mr. Harris' analysis because the entire book addresses the subconscious mind, NOT someone consciously making a decision through the use of free will.  For example, Mr. Harris says there is no free will in preferring one taste over another.  I completely agree, but that is not free will.  Instead, that preference is subconsciously determined by genetics and perhaps even life experiences.  However, just because I prefer the taste of Oreo cookies over broccoli does not mean I don't have free will to chose which one to eat.  There is no arguing the fact that I do have the free will to choose to eat broccoli instead of Oreos, even though I much prefer the taste of Oreos.  Bottom line is that this book was a waste of my time and money.<br /><br />I should have known from the beginning that it was going to be disappointing because the book itself looks like it was put together by a third grade child.  The pages were all uneven and looked like it was a homemade scrap book glued together.  There were random ink splotches all over too, indicating that a poor quality publisher was used.
1449305172|4.0|I think this book is a worthwhile addition to my growing stable of lean startup titles.<br />The book does expand on the existing body of literature.<br />However, I think it could do with a considerable overhaul of the layout and use of typefaces almost at random.<br />Ergonomically it is a bit hard to follow sometimes due to this poor editorial oversight.<br />That doesn't negate the value of its content however.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was excited to read this book considering all the hype, and I love good reading material for lady bath time. HOWEVER, as I was reading this book I was not impressed! It is like the same scene over and over again. There is no character development, real or thoughtful story line, and the circumstances surrounding the characters are absolutely ridiculous. How in heck is an American college student a virgin who has never rubbed one out and who doesn't even seem to own her own dress a realistic character?? Then all of a sudden she meets some weird guy who she thinks is a homosexual and she gives him the best BJ of his life on the first date or whatever (I might be paraphrasing)?!? So I hate that premise because it just sounds dumb unless she is like \\"Breaking Amish\\" which is not mentioned in the book. The girl is also a \\"crazy chick\\" who seems to be SUPER stalker-ish and obsessed with the status of their \\"sex-lationship\\" which I don't think is attractive in this type of reading material. I am glad I didn't buy the entire trilogy for Kindle because there is NO WAY that I could stand reading 2 more books of this nonsense seeing as it was a struggle to finish the first book. Some points were somewhat entertaining, but not anything to get in a tizzy for. Not recommended...this was a waste of time that I could have spent reading a GOOD lady-time book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As with the first two books I jumped right on in with Mockingjay. As i've said before this is the BEST TRILOGY EVER!!! Of the three books Mockingjay was my favorite. The emotion betweeen Katniss and Peeta and the story line was perfect! As with the rest of the trilogy I couldn't put it down! I reccomend this book and the other two Hunger Games books to all teen readers! <3

I recomend this and the other two HUnger Games books to EVERYONE!!! &lt;3
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I thought this was one of the best movies I have seen with a story line all summer.<br />I think pre-teen and teenagers could learn from the examples from the movie
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book!  i had that nice feeling of not wanting to put it down.  There were several points where i came across some particularly clever line and read it aloud to my husband.  i feel like some of the later books are among his best.  This one might not make my top five but i did definitely enjoy it as a good summer read...
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book was very enjoyable reading, but some of his\\"first hand descriptions of the actions were described by him even though he was not in the room where he describes the action.
1455502758|5.0|I never enjoyed reading.  Maybe because I felt most fiction was fluff, and most non-fiction was a bore.<br /><br />When I first picked up God Is Not Great a few years back, I read it cover to cover - TWICE.  I have never in my life been touched by a writer like I was by Hitchens.  I wanted more - every book that came out before, and after.<br /><br />I was both excited and afraid to read Mortality.  Excited because I loved his writings; but sad to know it was the VERY last.  I opened it slowly with trepidation...  But once I began to read that evening on the train ride home, I didn't stop until I finished the book later that night with tears running down my face.  The last chapter I guess I expected to have exceeded 1/2 of a page but, what was on that page was exactly what should have been the end.<br /><br />Hitchens will never be duplicated.  He will be sincerely missed...  This world will just not be the same without his level of inquisitiveness and intelligence.
B008QDCZ3S|4.0|Yes, there are some shortcomings to the 5.0 surround mix done by Sony when SACD was in its infancy, and which has been included here as a \\"bonus\\" on the disc. Note: the labeling says its a Hybrid Stereo disc, but it in fact has the multichannel mix as well, as noted on the Analogue Prod. website. The previous reviewer noted that there were no low frequencies in the 5.0 mix. There in fact are low frequencies in this multichannel mix, they are just located in the main speaker channels, ie. not in a separate LFE channel, so if you're player's bass management isn't giving you enough bass while playing the mix you'll have to turn up your sub settings on your receiver (mine sounded best a good 10dB above the level of the mains. The same goes for the surround channels on this mix. They are present (containing the recording studio ambiance) they are just recorded lower than usual. Again, I got a great sounding mix by turning my surround channels up a good 10dB above my LCR channels. When these tweaks are made to your surround equipment, the original Sony 5.0 mix sounds great with a real natural, live sound. Of course as noted in the previous review the new stereo mix sounds amazing right out of the gate (no tweaks needed). So yes, the 5.0 surround mix has some shortcomings, but if you have a few minutes try tweaking your channel levels and I bet you too will be able to get that same live sound out of the multichannel mix on this disc.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|A must to read...and for every age. The book makes you realize the importance of acceptance of our humanness. This book shows how each life has a big roll in the big picture; and how we all, should learn to love what is imperfect.
B000002H6C|5.0|1988's \\"...And Justice For All\\", is one of their best albums. DFespite the fact that there is almost no bass, they still manage to keep it together. Personal favorites for me include, ...And Justice For All, One The Frayed Ends of Sanity, and To Live Is To Die. Keep it up, and Justice is here
B000FC1192|3.0|I bought this book as something light for reading and it didn't disappoint me. It is well written and fun to read. It catches your attention from the beginning to the end. If you want something fun to read in almost no time, I highly recommend this book.

B000HF6XV8|5.0|I've been an avid fan of Frances Hodgson Burnett for years and was thrilled when I first saw this film adaptation of The Secret Garden. It's done very well and captures the tenor of the book very well.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very well written with a gripping storyline that will have you desperate to know what happens in the end, even if the conclusion is a touch unconvincing, but nonetheless, definitely recommended reading.
B0064NTZ6W|4.0|I first saw this movie years ago on Laser Disk and it was very good.  The transfer to Blu-ray is great.  The movie probably gives the most accurate portrayal of what it is like to be in a submarine in WWII and when it is under depth charge attack, and a depth charge attack is the worst thing that can happen to a submariner. This movie holds your attention to the end, which is a bummer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl....it hit such a range of emotions.  The marriage, with it's disconnects, hits home.  Aren't all unions subject to ups and downs, questions, doubts.<br />But then it becomes so twisted with the wife's, Amy, disappearance on their fifth anniversary.  She became the antagonist and Nick, her husband, the victim.  Then it changed and changed and then changed again.<br />Do you ever really know anybody?  How could two people love each other but even consider doing what they were doing and had done....all in the name of love.<br />As the book comes to a close, I  felt even more conflicted over who was sane, normal, balanced and who was the \\"evil\\" one.<br />Gillian Flynn does a great job of pulling the reader into the story, flipping feelings and emotions all over the place, and then quietly walking away.<br />I am still reeling over Gone Girl and it's been two weeks since I finished reading it...it's really worth a read.
B00709GTGS|5.0|This s just a great movie.  A simple little boy meets girl; boy, Leopold, likes girl; girl, Kate, likes boy.  The problem is Leopold is from another time, the past, and does not belong here!  Kate's current boyfriend, Stuart, figured out how to time travel to the past and Leopold accidentally followed him back from the past to the current time.  The problem: get Leopold back to the past.  And oh no, Leopold is Stuart's great, great grandfather.  Worse yet, Kate (grandma?) may belong in the past with Leopold, not the future! And who the heck is Otis?  Watch the movie and find out.  It is a wonderful nights entertainment.

B008SVS3FC|5.0|Who writes a song better than John Hiatt? Just a master at turning a phrase and baking it all inside a great rhythm groove.<br /><br />I think this may be his most \\"complete\\" release in years. Band is firing on all cylinders and have great content to work with.<br /><br />Big question now is will \\"We're alright now\\" be a hit for John or is it going to take a female country singer to take it to the top of the charts? Maybe a Bonnie Raitt comeback??!
B00338QENI|4.0|I was recommended this book by a friend and am glad I took her word! This book is highly interesting medically, most heart wrenching in the human rights area, and intriguing on the part of Henrietta Lacks' family and journey. It is well written, very well laid out (with some minor typos... but no big deal, really). The history of medicine is rich... but it is also troubling that some of the very cures and advances we have today come from the sacrifice of so many that were mistreated, ignored, or discriminated against.
0307960471|4.0|His address is Chungking Mansions, Hong Kong, but Harry Hole returns to Oslo to work on a murder case.  Tord Schul, a pilot, is transporting a legal substance to  Bangkok.

1454701250|5.0|First off...if you are the least bit interested in making your own stamps, order this book right now!  It's the best book I've seen written on stamp making.  I've followed Geninne's blog for sometime now and always thought her artwork to be wonderful.  I pre-ordered the book as soon as I saw it was available and just received it yesterday.  I read the entire book!!! Yes, read each page!!!  Geninne's book has so many tips, motifs and templates that you won't know where to start first!  But she'll help you with that as well!  Just start at the beginning of the book and follow along!  That's exactly what I plan on doing!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The writer does make it seem like it was only the Navy Seals who captured/killed UBL; however, there were numerous other agencies who were involved and who participated in the raid that did not receive credit.  Owell, I'm glad the story is out so others can understand that there are people in this world who are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms.  The people in our country need to wake up and realize that this fight is only the beginning.  We need people in government who have faith and trust in our military, not college pot heads who know nothing about sacrifice.  Great book, I'll be reading it again in a few months.

0385344333|2.0|Some writers do a dependably great job. Others seem to falter as they become more successful. WEB Griffin is one who, in my mind, faltered years ago; another is Stuart Woods. And, now I fear, Lee Childs. I listened to the book and, in truth, I should have stopped after the first hour or so--it was as if there was no real story to be told so the author just needed to fill pages. But I muddled through the entire book with hopes. But, in the end, there really wasn't much of a story. A waste of my time. So sad.

B009AJDDQU|2.0|I didn't go into this thinking about the Alien saga, and truly didn't expect much after reading the reviews, but this movie, that had potential, was extremely disappointing.  It started out interesting, but quickly became incoherent.  It almost like it was poorly cut.  Special effects were not particularly interesting.
B0002KQNL8|4.0|Return of the Living Dead Part II begins with a military truck transporting barrels of Trioxin(which many of you will recall was what made the zombies rise in the original Return of the Living Dead). The soldiers driving this truck are smoking marijuana and don't notice when a barrel breaks loose from the truck.  The barrel is found by some teenagers who release the Trioxin gas, which enters a nearby cemetery causing the dead to return once again. Thus beginning the saga in RotLD, Part II.<br /><br />Written and directed by Ken Wiederhorn, this film had a decidedly lighter tone than the original. Like the original, however, it is a movie that fans of the series hold in high regard. Mainly because because of its' comedic content and the fact that it didn't take itself so seriously as a zombie movie.<br /><br />Little do people know that this series is what spawned movies like Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, Fido, Zombie Dearest, Juan of the Dead and others to happen. It's a fun romp that's sure to please everyone. It's great for a Halloween movie. It's a series I highly recommend to one and all.
B004ZJZQJC|5.0|What can I say, as a Sci-Fi fan this one struck a chord when I first saw it. It's campy, very 80s style, but has an interesting \\"hero-villian\\" story line that reminds me of Star Wars. The graphics are right out of an old video game (Mission Commander to be excat), but hey, it just mindless entertainment. And - it's \\"G\\" rated so even the kids can watch it. :)
B008RV5K4U|5.0|Ten years after Batman has retired, and Gotham City has sunk deeper into lawlessness; the Batman returns to aid Gotham city in its' need. Joined by Carrie Kelly, a young female Robin, Batman takes to the streets to end the threat of the mutant gangs that have overrun the city. After facing off against his two greatest enemies, the Joker and Two-Face, for the final time, Batman finds himself in mortal combat with his former ally, Superman, in a battle that only one of them will survive.<br /><br />I'll admit, I was a little displeased with Batman: Year One. What worked so well for the \\"Year One\\" comic was exactly what didn't work for the animated feature. Even though it was faithful to Frank Miller's work, something about it was just amiss. Still, I purchased it and added it to my collection. Yes, I recommend it to everyone as well but I wasn't completely happy with it. Which brings me to the new Warner Premiere/DC Universe animated feature, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1. I must admit, this is one time that Bruce Timm and Co. got it all right. This adaptation completely nails the tone and atmosphere of the book. What amazes me is how they don't shy away from the explicit themes from the comic book, like Rape, Murdering Children and the like. Course, if you'll notice from most of the Warner Premiere animated features, things aren't too explicit yet they do deal with more adult themes. This particular tale reminded me of the Spawn Animated series to a certain extent, in utilizing the shadows and darkness to create a very ambient and dark tone. Peter Weller & Ariel Winter do a great job as The Dark Knight and his sidekick, Robin.<br /><br />I like how Warner Premiere and DC Comics keep bringing animated versions of DC's greatest works and I hope that they continue the trend. Marvel seems too content in spawning original tales with their animated features, which is fine. They hadn't missed a beat, if truth be known. I hadn't seen any other DC animated feature that has successfully captured the atmosphere and themes of its original work than this one has. I'm quite impressed and look forward to Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2 next year.hat has successfully captured the atmosphere and themes of its original work than this one has.

B007SSEU9O|3.0|Mostly a showcase for Meryl Streep and very little of Margaret Thatcher's remarkable place in history.  The dynamic relationship between Ms. Thatcher and President Reagan was largely missing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been reading sci-fi and fantasy for more than 30 years and in all that time, it's rare to come across a story that is as unique and well written as this series. One complaint, if you can call it that.... It left me hungry for more! I look forward to reading everything by this author and for the follow on stories he has planned. Great series, great characters, and a whole new world to explore.
B008NW67E0|5.0|The underpinning emotion of pop music is teenage angst. That was true back in the 1960s with songs like Lesley Gore's \\"It's My Party,\\" it was true in the 1990's when punk and grunge ruled the airwaves and it is true today as embodied by Carly Rae Jepsen's \\"Call Me Maybe.\\" Gangsta rap was underpinned by urban teenage angst.<br /><br />Mumford & Sons' debut CD \\"Sigh No More\\" upped the ante, bringing Boomer angst to the forefront and striking a chord with older listeners, raised on folk and rock'n'roll. It is a post-idealism, older but wiser demographic that advancing age and economic uncertainty has created, a demographic that is once more looking introspectively and realizing that love and family are what truly matters. \\"Sigh No More\\" signified a forefront in the neo-folk renaissance and became a bestseller and Grammy nominee and made Mumford & Sons' latest \\"Babel\\" one of the most anticipated new releases of 2012. Were they the real thing or a flash in the pan capturing a fleeting moment in the music industry?<br /><br />With the release of \\"Babel\\" we know the answer. Mumford & Sons are the real f***ing deal. \\"Babel\\" is brilliant from its opening title track through (in this Deluxe Edition) the finale, \\"Where Are You Now.\\" It is an angst fest that somehow manages to confront the past (\\"Ghosts That We Knew\\" and \\"Reminder\\"), the present (\\"Hopeless Wanderer\\" and \\"Lovers' Eyes\\") and the future (\\"I Will Wait\\" and \\"Not With Haste\\"). Yet despite the angst ridden songs \\"Babel\\" is a resoundingly hopeful, uplifting album. A case could be made lyrically that these songs are sung not to another human being but to a greater power. The songs on \\"Babel\\" are ultimately about the triumph of the spirit over hard times and heartbreak, a message in which Baby Boomers such as myself can take comfort.<br /><br />Marcus Mumford's voice is an expressive wonder, pulling you in and grabbing successfully for your soul. You feel his pain, his passion, his confusion. When he sings \\"This ain't no sham/I am what I am\\" on \\"Not With Haste,\\" the twelfth song (and finale of the non-deluxe version) you know exactly who the \\"I\\" of the song is because he has laid himself bare in these uncompromising, heartful songs that reveal his core beliefs and fears. At times he reminded me of such Boomer icons as Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen (minus the bombast) and the darker side of Harry Chapin.<br /><br />& Sons once again are simply brilliant. The way they can spin acoustic instruments into a powerful tornado of sound is genius. They don't accompany Marcus Mumford as much as they are his duet partner, blending with his emotion and filling the empty spaces where words alone are insufficient. They are as essential to the success of \\"Babel\\" as Mr. Mumford himself.<br /><br />Whether there is a track on \\"Babel\\" to inspire iTunes and chart success I can't say with any certainty. What I can say is no album in 2012 to date has so thoroughly moved me and made me listen as closely as I did to \\"Babel.\\" Right now it's my choice for Album Of The Year.sham/I am what I am\\" on \\"Not With Haste,\\" the twelfth song (and finale of the non-deluxe version) you know exactly who the \\"I\\" of the song is because he has laid himself bare in these uncompromising, heartful songs that reveal his core beliefs and fears.

B00957T6X6|1.0|I was coming online to purchase the four book set that was available a few weeks ago at $25, however, it seems the publisher doubled the price to add book five, and thus, lost a sale.  I have waited this long to get into the series, I can wait longer for the price to come down again.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Like a lot of other people, I assumed this would be another soulless CGI-fest that would have me rolling my eyes at stupid dialogue and suspenseless, overblown action sequences. I couldn't have been more wrong. JC looks and feels like a labor of love, a courageously heartfelt salute to the imagination of ERB. It's instantly engaging and wildly entertaining throughout. I rented it online for 24 hours... and I watched it twice during that span!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|with all the pre-release hype that I thought might be to sell books, I was very surprised to find this book a fantastic read.  The book is well-written and it makes you feel like you are embedded within the SEALS on the missions described in the book; including the mission that killed Osama Bin Ladin.  I highly recommend this book!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was excited to read the last book and for the most part it was good, but I felt the story  had to many quick endings to situations going on in the triology.  More explanation of some characters would have been nice.  The ending conclusion of the main character 's life was too forced and summed up.

B006OFN0SE|5.0|I love movies directed by Clint Eastwood, he's a great story teller and his somewhat unhurried shooting style never fails to draw me in, even `Hereafter' which I thought was a bit bland, was beautifully shot. Here, Eastwood delivers again in `J.Edgar', a biopic that follows the career of the man who created what is now known as the Federal Bureau of Investigations; J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />I can't speak for the accuracy of the history or how they portrayed the man, I'm sure some things were embellished for the sake of drama, but as a film, Eastwood has crafted a compelling and engaging movie. I was fascinated at seeing how the FBI started out as a powerless bureau and Hoover crafted it into the law enforcement organization it is today, not to mention make headway into forensics investigations.<br /><br />Watching Hoover himself, and his complicated relationships with the people around him, was an emotional rollercoaster as things unfolded on screen, I found myself rooting for J. Edgar one minute and absolutely hating him the next to pitying him later on, and sometimes all at the same time as well. If you're looking for anything about Hoover's cross-dressing, you'll be sorely disappointed, it is only briefly touched on here, but the bulk of the movie is about the FBI.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is captivating as the very much flawed titular character and Armie Hammer is equally strong as Hoover's right-hand man, Clyde Tolson. Naomi Watts doesn't let the film down either as Hoover's personal assistant and Judi Dench as Hoover's mother. But, really, all the actors go a tremendous job at getting us into these characters.<br /><br />`J. Edgar' is worth a watch if not the purchase, if there was one thing that bothered me about the movie it's that it does jump back and forth a lot between time periods, it's like one moment you're in the 1920's the next, it's the 1960's, it can be a bit confusing in some parts, other than that, this is a great movie manages to keep youengaged for it's 137 minute run-time.<br /><br />The disc includes `J. Edgar: a complicated man', it's a short documentary with the cast and crew talking about Hoover and also shooting the film. It's okay, but nothing special.

B008NW67E0|5.0|After listening to their first album a little too much for any normal human being, a second album from Mumford and Sons is something that I have been anticipating for a long time. With the foot-stomping energy of the first album, it seemed difficult to imagine they could produce another album with such power and emotion. In short: they did it.<br /><br />Babel: 5/5 - From the first notes, it's evident the track for which the album is titled is going to be energetic. The thumping bass drum, the seemingly ever-present banjo, and Marcus Mumford's soaring vocals starts the album off on an excellent note.<br /><br />Whispers In The Dark: 4.5/5 - \\"Babel\\" carries straight into this track, the second song of the album. \\"Whispers In The Dark\\" keeps the energy from fading and is a good complement to \\"Babel\\".<br /><br />I Will Wait: 6/5 - If you've been listening to the radio at all recently, you've most likely heard this played a fair amount. However, there's good reason for that: it's an excellent song. After finding an older, live version of this song on YouTube about a year and a half ago (titled \\"Nothing is Unwritten\\"), this is absolutely fantastic to listen to. The addition of the \\"I will wait/I will wait/I will wait for you\\" part was genius in my opinion, as the old version seemed to be a little lacking. All in all, a fantastic track.<br /><br />Holland Road: 5/5 - After the fast-paced \\"I Will Wait\\", \\"Holland Road\\" slows things down a little, but still manages to keep the same energy. The refrain of \\"ah\\"s feels like a relaxing massage, which is very pleasant to listen to.<br /><br />Ghosts That We Knew: 5/5 - \\"Ghosts That We Knew\\" is the first slow song on the album. The mellow and relaxing nature of the song is accentuated with fantastic harmonies, making this one of my personal favorites of the album.<br /><br />Lover Of The Light: 4.5/5 - The energy is brought back up with this, the sixth track on the album. The song takes a little bit to build, but once it does, you'll be bouncing to the tune. An excellent and energetic song keeps the album flowing.<br /><br />Hopeless Wanderer: 5/5 - \\"Hopeless Wanderer\\" brings down the intensity a bit. The harmonies are particularly excellent, in my opinion. The thumping bass drum during the final part of the song is a great touch.<br /><br />Broken Crown: 4/5 - This, the eighth song on the album, is a quick, two minute track of Marcus Mumford and his guitar. A break in the action, it showcases the lead singer's ability to perform. This song didn't seem to click for me, however, so I rate it a little lower.<br /><br />Hopeless Wanderer: 5/5 - \\"Hopeless Wanderer\\" begins sounding a little basic, but then the guitar begins speeding up and you're off. The power of this song, from the soaring vocals to the banjo to the the piano, is thrilling to experience.<br /><br />Broken Crown: 4.5/5 - Slowing the pace down, \\"Broken Crown\\" is the only song so far where there's noticeable foul language. All in all, a good song.<br /><br />Below My Feet: 5/5 - \\"Below My Feet\\" is another song I found live on YouTube a little while back. It was one of my favorites then, and it still is. The tempo seems to be in the middle of the tempos that Mumford and Sons tend to favor. The layering of sound on this one is excellent and provides for a very rich listening experience.<br /><br />Not With Haste: 4.5/5 - The final song of the regular version of the album, \\"Not With Haste\\" is slower and isn't quite as layered as other songs. It's a fitting, although maybe a little lacking, closing track to the album.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks:<br /><br />For Those Below: 4.5/5 - This is one of the first songs I've heard that doesn't have Marcus Mumford as the lead singer. This song also has some electric guitar in the background, which is surprising. It seems to work, however.<br /><br />The Boxer: 5/5 - The harmonies in this song are some of the best on the whole album. It also seems to have a little more of a country \\"twang\\" to it than other songs, although it is quite minimal.<br /><br />Where Are You Now: 4.5/5 - This song is a tad repetitious, but is still a great song that leaves you satisfied.<br /><br />While some people might say Mumford and Sons' songs sound the same, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. They've found a sound that's adored by many and is a great contrast to some of the other genres of popular music. With this second album, Mumford and Sons should continue to ascend to new heights and grab more listeners than before.<br /><br />Final rating: 5/5
B001FW58D6|2.0|seriously? they throw in enough 5-dollar-word jargon to make us think this show is done with intelligence, but its just another unbelievable characters, unrealistic scenarios, and a poor attempt to mix X-files and abrams-esque slow-bake thriller-ism. had to stop this one half way through the first show. boo!
B0031569HE|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to prepare myself for the GMAT exam, (I'm trying to pursue my CPA) once I'm back from the Army. The questions these books provide are very helpful and it has a small explanation of the correct answers. I also bought the Kaplan Princeton Review (which is another awesome book, if its used with this book). I haven't gone through the entire book, but I will do so before I take the exam. Hopefully I get an awesome score!

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I thought this young romance was a breath of fresh air.  I especially liked that the main character was a young college student who seemed smart beyond her years, and don't get me started on Travis! Even though I'm way too old for him, I had such a crush on this character.  The author did a great job of writing a story that sucked me in right away and made the rest of the world fall away.  Would recommend this to anyone who loves tatooed hunky guys and moving romances.

In order of preference are:<br />Fifty Shades Freed<br />Fifty Shades Darker and<br />Fifty Shades of Grey<br /><br />For me personally, I found Fifty Shades Freed more realistic and it got you thinking ahead of what the outcome<br />of certain scenarious would end up being.<br /><br />For those who thought the Fifty Shades of Grey to be a little over the top, I am sure, like me, you will enjoy the other 2 books more.<br /><br />Diane - Australia
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Third time reading this book.  Still love it.  Waiting to read Mocking Jay before the movie comes out.  Cannot wait.
0061251321|5.0|The book makes good distinctions on 5 stages where individuals can be.<br /><br />Stage 1 - Life sucks<br />Stage 2 - My life sucks<br />Stage 3 - I'm great (and you're not)<br />Stage 4 - We're great (and they're not)<br />Stage 5 - Life is great<br /><br />What's helpful is that the authors tell you the signs to look for, the language that is used by what stage, and the underlying mindsets that are causing the problems for each stage.<br /><br />And then on top of that, there are practical insights as to how to \\"upgrade\\" people from one stage to another.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed the read. The only thing I was disappointed about was the lack of data and conclusions for stage 5 cultures and beyond; there wasn't as much depth as the other stages. But they do explain near the end of the book that this is because they just haven't come across many company cultures or even individuals that function at that level on a regular basis, thus, making it hard to document, observe, and learn from.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Before I comment, I need to mention that when the world is on the brink of disaster, I would like someone like Chris in my corner.<br />Chris is literally a serial killer on parole. I would think the Navy would want someone who is professional at what they do and not someone who takes pleasure in killing bad guys. Then again, I've never served in the forces and would not know what it's like to protect ones country from a race that believes in killing in the name of God.<br />I enjoyed (not like Chris!) the personal accounts of what transpired during Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL!). I was just shocked at the pleasures he took in wiping out the enemy...<br /><br />I think Chris's wife should have got all the medals!
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Anyone who knows Indiana Jones already knows the plots of these films, so I won't pontificate on those details, and will get right to the transfers:  The Picture (Raiders):  The picture is very sharp, and the dark scenes show exceptionally deep shadow areas and rich colors, especially in the Ravenwood bar, which looks absolutely gorgeous, even more real than I remember it looking in cinemas, but I'm saddened to see that the highlights in the bright outdoor daylight scenes are largely blown out, white, gone.  This is either a problem with the transfer, or, and I hope not, the source, the original film negative. If the latter, it's so sad to see a great film like Raiders fade over time. If the former, we'll have to wait for yet another transfer. If I remember correctly, Lowry Digital Studios did the restorations for DVD back in 2003. I'm guessing the 2012 archivists, at Lowry or another facility, didn't use that old Lowry transfer for blu-ray because it was a much lower res scan than the 4k scan done here.  The transfer of Raiders also carries with it what another reviewer described as an &#34;orange teal&#34;; that is, everything is colored in a kind of warm, golden amber yellow-orange tint. This is great in the Raven bar and in the Idol's temple when Indy is bathed in the shaft of light emanating from the golden Idol itself, but, in other scenes, like the thunderstorm in the desert at night when the Arabs are uncovering the Well of Souls, the scene should be more blue, and is instead, in the amber tint of this transfer, kind of a neutral gray.  Compared to Temple, Crusade and even Crystal Skull, which look gorgeous, true to their big-screen incarnations, sadly, Raiders is a pale digital facsimile of the original film.  This transfer could have and should have looked so much deeper and richer, with black as black, with its highlights preserved, with its proper color pallette.  Movies should be honored as time capsules and merely restored to how they looked in the time they were made, not digitally &#34;enhanced&#34;, &#34;updated&#34; to today's aesthetic tastes.  There has to be some technical standard, a reference point for what a film looked like at the time of its release.  The transfer and restoration artists ALMOST got this transfer right, but, sadly, they didn't honor the look of the original film and instead did a &#34;digital revision&#34;.  If director Steven Spielberg himself signed off on, approved this transfer, he either didn't view it on a correctly calibrated monitor, he was too busy on other projects to really feast his eyes on it, or he's going senile.  Considering that Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite, and, arguably, the best movie in the whole Indiana Jones series, this transfer is a bit disheartening and disappointing, to say the least. To some of you who weren't born yet in 1981 when Raiders was originally released in cinemas, so you never got to see it on the big screen, and thus you have no reference for what Raiders is supposed to look like, you'll enjoy it just fine.  If you already own the DVD of Raiders, hold onto it, as it is, minus the standard-definition limitations of DVD, closer to Raiders' original, true cinematic vision.  I'll hold onto the DVD until a blu-ray is done properly, at which point the proper blu-ray disc will assume its rightful place on the throne of its slot in this blu-ray set, replacing this blu-ray disc, which will go in the trash.  I have to give the visual transfer of Raiders on blu-ray only a 3 out of 5 stars.  The Sound (Raiders):  Some sound-FX and dialogue are crystal clear, with some new effects added, like dripping water in the South American temple and some new &#34;pfew!&#34; sound-FX of the poison darts spitting at Indy when he removes the Idol from its pedestal and flees as all hell breaks loose (YES! Thanks, Ben Burtt!), others less than stellar, a bit muted, and, like the Jaws transfer for blu-ray, sound mixers added that extra reverb to John Williams' classic score...broadened the spaciousness and cavernousness of the music, but the music now lacks the definition and clarity of the highs found on previous releases. Sounds like the London Symphony Orchestra is performing at a ball game. Enveloping, and yet lacking definition. Disappointing. I have to give the sound of Raiders a 4 out of 5 stars.  Now, onto Temple and Crusade...  The picture:  I'm only guessing here, and could be wrong, but it looks like these ARE the earlier, and excellent 2003 Lowry digital transfers done for the DVDs, now shown in their native high-res format, instead of being down-rezzed by the picture-quality limitations of DVD. They look great! The color red is more prevalent on the blu-rays of Temple and Crusade than on their corresponding DVDs, which is especially useful, and wonderful, inside the Temple of Doom, with all the red presumably coming from fiery volcanic fissures. This is a masterwork of film lighting from the late, great cinematographer Douglas Sloccombe, and is presented here gorgeously. Bravo!  The sound:  It has some nice new discreet directionality in the rear surrounds, which is especially evident in Crusade, when the Messerchmidts are chasing Indy and his dad. And John Williams' scores have never sounded better!  Kingdom of the Crystal Skull:  Picture quality seems to be the same as the previous blu-ray, which already looked quite good, faithful to Skull's theatrical release. The main difference here is the sound has been updated to DTS-HD, adding more depth to the soundtrack.  The extras from the DVD set are all here, with some new additions:  On Set With Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I found particularly rivetting, about the increasingly lost, dying art of on-set live action production. It shows the miracle of what was accomplished in-camera, with very little reliance on post-production, until we get to the opening of the Ark of the Covenant, with director Steven Spielberg saying how hard it is to explain to actors something that they can't see, and won't be there until post-production visual FX are completed. What I found most captivating about watching this footage is it shows just how tireless Steven Spielberg is. He really deserves all the money and credit he gets, because he works very hard. And he clearly LOVES what he is doing, making movies!  The original 1981 featurette, The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark  The Melting Head, showcasing a modern reenactment of what was required to make Toht's head melt.  Indy's Women, showing a recent AFI interview with all three leading ladies in the classic trilogy, Karen Allen from Raiders, Kate Capshaw from Temple and Allison Doody from Crusade, talking about their characters and the experience of working on a tough, physical movie.  and probably one or two features I left out. It's a schmorgasbord. Enjoy!

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I like this game as a good time waster usually I play it before I go to sleep that way I can earn more coins while I am offline. You get coins every 30 seconds while you are playing it and every 9 minutes offline up to 45coins. It reminds me of the real game you can play in the arcades. Fun...while the coins last.
B006LSZECO|5.0|omg...ok first let me say that for me the book was very slow and confussing but i kept reading.  im so glad i did because it turned out so good.  the wife ended up  being crazier then i ever thought someone could be!  the things she thought of were scary snd insane.  great book everyone should read.
B008K7WCJM|3.0|This is long and hard to listen to.  You really need to be a fan of this type of music or wish to be driven insane by the repetition.  I had an idea of what I was getting into when I bought this.  I listened to it a few times but nothing for me.  It's just hard to listen to and strikes me as music that people will listen to so they can say they listen to strange music.  I gave it 3 stars because of the production value and the amount of work that went into it.  There are instrumentals that are quite good and the musicians are talented.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love this game.  The graphics are excellent and so is the storyline.  You can zoom in which should be a must have feature.  Very addicting.
B005MTHRAA|5.0|Pasolini's \\"Medea\\" is for me the most fascinating, thought-provoking film about \\"Ancient Times.\\" I want it to be more watched and pondered. Here are some considerations, quick notes.<br /><br />Consider Medea as an archetype, an enabler of transformation, metamorphosis, very similar to the role played by John Wayne in some John Ford films, especially \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" and \\"The Searchers\\" -- she enabled the triumph of one kind of civilization over another, then understood there was scant place for her in that new world. Unlike the John Wayne characters however she decided on cruel revenge.<br /><br />What world did she help vanquish? Call it earth-oriented, nature-worshipping and chthonian, heeding gods and demigods and spirits of forests and fields and harvests, Dionysian, often with a central role for a young vegetation god who dies and is reborn. Pasolini's deft depiction is probably more historically accurate than many will want to believe. The evidence suggests human sacrifice was practiced by many early agricultural societies, especially in the selection of a youth from a prominent, often ruling, family to be honored, perhaps for a year, as a divinity among mortals, but whose mission was fulfilled only when his sacred flesh and blood by sacrifice sanctified, revivified the community and harvests. This may have had its origin in the instinctual knowledge within perhaps most animals with cardiovascular and nervous systems and living in groups that when danger is sensed, when a relentless and recurrent predator stalks the perimeter, one must die for the rest to be saved.<br /><br />What world did she empower, help create? Call it Apollinian, oriented toward the sky, the clear light of reason, rationality, seeking to transcend mere nature and superstition. Pasolini makes majestic use of Pisa's \\"Field of Miracles\\" to evoke this realm rising toward prominence in ancient Greece and again in late medieval Italy. A world which wants to be rid of the Medeas, the archaic sorceresses, sibyls, witches.<br /><br />Like Jason, Pasolini spent much of his childhood among the gruff, coarser, simpler, mythical (especially to a child) folk of mountain glens and woodlands and marshland bays: in Friuli, northeastern Italy, considered remote and backward in the cosmopolitan circles where he later lived and excelled. Determined to not forget or reject (heeding the advice of the Centaur to Jason), he continued to write poetry in the Friuli dialect, which seemed archaic to friends; he also sought contact with that more primal world in the demimonde, the underbelly, of Rome; as his films show, he did not detach, divorce himself from that nether realm so resistant to cosmopolitan rationality of even the best intentions. Pasolini wanted to keep his inner Medea flourishing and in creative agon with his intellect. And he managed to recreate in his film the themes, tensions, poetic intuitions, agons of ancient tragedy.eas, the archaic sorceresses, sibyls, witches.<br /><br />Like Jason, Pasolini spent much of his childhood among the gruff, coarser, simpler, mythical (especially to a child) folk of mountain glens and woodlands and marshland bays: in Friuli, northeastern Italy, considered remote and backward in the cosmopolitan circles where he later lived and excelled.

B005LAIH4A|5.0|I have to admit that when \\"The Lorax\\" came out in theaters only one of my eyebrows went up in limited interest, and we never got around to seeing it in the theater...I thought, I'll catch up to it when it comes out on disc.  Last night my wife, 13 yr old daughter, and I caught \\"The Lorax\\" on DVD.<br /><br />As the movie started I sat back and my immediate thought was that this is just Dr. Seuss-ian eye candy for little kids - a Hollywoodized version of Dr. Seuss' book of the same name.  And to be completely frank, I didn't quite know how the producers were going to make a full length feature out of \\"The Lorax\\".<br /><br />There are plenty of cute animals, an idealized vision of nature...and that put me off a bit at first.  As the story developed it soon became clear that the people of Thneedville were living in a dystopian society driven and monitored by a corporate entity...sort of a Big Brother is watching scenario where the Big Brother scenario exists solely to protect corporate interests and short-term profits, mainly for the people (in this case, person) at the top.  There were messages of elimination of personal privacy, misleading the general population for the corporate good, etc.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the character development and threaded story lines.<br /><br />The background story is told by \\"The Once-ler\\" in flashback mode, and sets the stage for the significance of the movie.  It's a tale of a good person being blinded by personal ambition and  greed, followed by over-harvesting to produce a luxury item for which an artificial need was generated by popular demand, followed by over production at the expense of environmental health, and then economic of the company when resources become depleted, and ecological crash of the environment needed to provide even basic services, like photosynthesis, for us and all living things.<br /><br />I was thoroughly unamused when the head of Thneedville's main corporation responds to scientific information - the suggestion that trees produce clean air by photosythesis - with obvious disdain and blind outright dismissal as something made up, a hoax? (Sound familiar to anything happening today?).<br /><br />OK, here's the bottom line.  If you are a promoter/supported of completely unregulated free-enterprise-at-all-costs-capitalism you will hate this movie.  If, however, you are concerned about the state of the environment and the way we are managing/mismanaging it, and realize the need for a change then this movie will not only strike a chord with you, it will hit you as being highly significant and you will recommend it highly to everyone you can get to watch it.<br /><br />In summary, this movie is actually a thesis on the current state of business, economy, and the environment in the United States.  Watch it if you dare.<br /><br />5 stars!ggestion that trees produce clean air by photosythesis - with obvious disdain and blind outright dismissal as something made up, a hoax?

B00887490Y|4.0|The title and preview made us think this was a slenderman movie which was exciting to my son. I watched it to make sure of the content (he is 14) and was surprised. I won't give spoilers but I will let him watch with the warning that it is not what he was hoping. I liked the movie because it did cause some thinking and had a interesting twist.
B0090EIILU|1.0|I had a feeling this was going to be a pretty awful movie based on the previews, but I loved the Ali G Hbo Show, Borat, and Bruno, so I gave it a shot.  Well, hopefully I can save you some time - don't see this movie.<br /><br />The plot is simple.  That's fine.  The problem is that the comedy is really weak and really contrived.  I don't recollect busting out laughing at any point (and I really love Sacha's previous work... so I really wanted to love this).  It just was a bunch of tired, predictable jokes.  No real twists or turns.  The acting was pretty subpar across the board.<br /><br />Anyway, bottom line - its a comedy that couldn't draw a single laugh out of me.  I wouldn't watch the movie again and really recommend that you pass on this one (and this is coming from a fan...)

While Gwen is still a badass without being trashy and slutty, and other members as well are as good, they still manage to come back with an amazing album. The album that is relevant to today's music without leaving their elements that's been there since the beginning. This is \\"pop\\" album at its best!! Not pop ala Justin Bieber or Katy Perry or Rihanna. This is on another level. Pls people buy this amazing album.

B000GBEWHA|5.0|Another great movie with John Travolta. He is one of the finest actors that ever lived. I love this movie and have watched it a million times. I never get tired of it. Olivia-Newton John is so beautiful and she played the part of Sandy perfectly. I also love Stockard Channing and her role as Rizzo was perfect. I have the Soundtrack from this movie and have listened to it so much. One of my favorite(among many) songs is \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\" and Olivia has such a beautiful voice. If I was to rate this movie from 1 to 10, I would give it a 20!!! Again, Amazon, you are the BEST!!!!

B008602KQI|4.0|I read this series of books prior to the release of this movie and I was looking forward to seeing the film.  Though it followed the plot of the story well, the direction leaves a little to be desired. I found it annoying that the director focused on symbols, like clasped hands, when I, as the viewer, was more interested in the action.  It often felt as though the movie kept stopping to make a point that was obvious.<br /><br />In my opinion, Jennifer Lawrence was perfect as Katniss Everdeen. Perfect. I also found the costumes and makeup to be excellent and in keeping with the mood and flavor of the story and very instrumental in demonstrating the disparity between the Capitol and the districts. I'll look forward to the next film hoping that I can view it through the eyes of a different director.
0307341550|1.0|I picked up this book as I bought into the hype of \\"Girls Gone\\". I have purchased Girls Gone and Dark place based on the raves, but decided to put it off and start with the first novel--Sharp Object first. I found myself thoroghtly dissapointed and kicking myself for buying her last 2 novels (I hope I will change my assessement).<br /><br />This review is about the audiobook version of this novel. A slow burn arose as I was listening to this pathetic, plain and painfully boring trash. I was hoping something great, eventually would come but it never did. The biggest problem, the heroin in this novel, is extremely unlikable--a self-cutting, drug/alcohol-addicted and dishonest reporter, without any plausible traits in her character. She does not seem to have any moral values.  She would let men, her mother, sister to manipulate her without fighting back. You are hoping eventually her redemption would come and it never did. The pacing is extremely slow, this is should have NEVER been marketed as a thriller, or a mystery novel. This is a plain old drama for a mind that is bored to death.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Who is Lindsey Stirling and why should I buy this album? you might ask.  She's a young solo artists who combines her love of dance & music into a fantastic display of what it means to love life and live it to the fullest.<br />Check her out on Youtube:  \\"Spontaneous Me\\", \\"Elements\\", \\"Skyrim\\" (with Peter Hollens - check out his video \\"The Prayer\\" he did with his wife),  and you'll be hooked.  Her videos are Filmed by Devin Graham (\\"Devinsupertramp\\" in Youtube) whose masterful cinematography captures every move in stunning HD.  These three young artists use modern recording tools and Youtube and sites like Amazon & iTunes which allows artists like these three to remain fully independent and yet produce top quality, professional grade work.<br /><br />Lindsey is full of life, and is very dynamic.  Her work is not recycled.  She sticks to her scruples and does not compromise and it's refreshing to see that in a world where young artists are pressured early on to do and be just what their producers & record companies want them to be.<br /><br />When listening to her music, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wanna dance!<br />Enjoy
B007L3BMGA|5.0|You want well written books, read Shakespeare. You want passion, white nights, drama read the trilogy...this book is a tabu breaker showing both women and men a way to a passionate libido and even if you take away the money thing, one can still associate with it giving us hope to eventually try out certain things within the limits that each of us can set for her/himself. One needs though great discipline to put the book down and get some sleep....very addictive in fact. Hoping that the author will find a way to write no. 4 maybe picking up from the last chapter of 50/3.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|What can I say except this game has been so much fun. I have advantage being I served in the Army years ago.

I always have a period of self-examination after I read his books - \\"The Alchemist\\" is another of my favorites that does just that.<br /><br />The quote, \\"A life unexamined is a life not worth living\\" is very true, and Paul's characters, certainly born his own life experiences and self examinations, leave me feeling more deeply about everything and everyone around me - on top of being totally entertained by an interesting, totally wonderful, absorbing storyline.
B002Q9MZF6|3.0|And whatever you do don't waste your time trying to get it to work in surround sound, because in 5.1 the voices are hopelessly recessed even for the long shots and in an even more unconvincing acoustic. This is another example of how NOT to make an opera film. It's not enough to make a good recording and then make a visually good film that more or less synchronises with the picture: you must conceive the two together and make sure they work together in terms of accoustic match and the way the characters are positioned in relation to each other. The following things need to be kept always in mind by the makers of the DVD - just so that they are never in the mind of the listener:  a) differences in the position of the singers should affect their vocal projection and volume - visually, in terms of the perceived physical effort of the singers as well as aurally, in relation to how we would hear that position relatively - e.g. they cannot have Villazon singing at full 'stage-volume' to the dying Mimi six inches in front of her face. Intimate scenes should be close-miked with singers projecting much less - this is really taking full advantage of the medium to do things that cannot be done in the opera house.  b) the perspective image of depth as it affects the volume of the voices in relation to the other singers or their prevous position in the scene.  c) the left-right stereo image as it relates picture and sound to each other, which for example should match when the picture changes from full view of the scene to close-up when the voices need to be in the middle of the sound stage and the voices more closely miked.  d) there should be an effort to distinguish between the likely accoustic of the perceived scene - especially when the scene is going to be changed to an entirely different one - as we expect on the basis of our normal experience.  These considerations mean therefore that they cannot use the same recording they intend to release on CD, but that instead they must make a separate recording, or at least a separately engineered recording, only intended for the DVD. If they can't manage to do any of these things as too difficult they should simply record the singing on set and not try to be too filmic with the cameras and editing. It is likely that in most cases, when for example there are no intimate scenes, they might as well film a live performance in the opera house - unless of course they intend to try filming outdoors. Even if all the points mentioned are observed it is still highly unlikely, when film footage is edited to 'fit' the prerecorded sound, that the viewer will be deceived into thinking he is hearing the characters actually singing in the scene, no matter how good the effort by the singer/actors to give that impression. The main impression one gets from this production is of a tremendous amount of good intentions.  But it's all to no avail, no matter how good the visual aspect is in itself, because the sound simply does not fit the picture and the very lively visuals completely distract from the music, which includes the singing of course. Every time I try to watch this film I end up wishing that the characters were speaking the words instead of singing them. At least then we would have a unique version of La Boheme as a play. Actually come to think of it a speaking soundtrack could have been included as an extra on the Blueray disc as an alternative. The naturalism of the mise-en-scene and the lively and imaginative direction are so impressive that it's a pity that it all goes to waste.  Oh well, at least you can listen without the picture.

It interfered a little bit with the story (in my opinion) because I already knew what was happening.

This is a stellar series that blends fantasy and medieval themes masterfully. A++

B0089BSOPA|3.0|Shout! (or in this case Scream) Factory has stuffed the Collector's Edition of \\"Halloween II\\" with such an appealing  Trick or Treat bag of DVD Bonus treats, it makes \\"Halloween II\\" seem better than it actually is. \\"Halloween II' is definitely a two stars sequel, but the DVD Extras included here kick it up  a notch,  (the Sound/Audio mix is particularly good on this Edition)  so my overall rating is three stars.<br />  Most interesting is the  2012 featurette \\"Halloween II: The Nightmare Isn't Over.\\" Producer Irwin Yablans says he got the idea for a sequel when all the money started pouring in from \\"Halloween\\" (1978). Yet, when he received the script from John Carpenter and Debra Hill, he hated it! Yablans calls the resulting film utterly \\"pedestrian.\\" He'll get no argument from me there. John Carpenter did not want to direct, preferring to move on to \\"The Fog\\" and \\"Escape From New York.\\" \\"Halloween\\" alumni Tommy Wallace, a logical choice to direct the sequel, also hated the script and passed. The job fell to Rick Rosenthal. Carpenter hated Rosenthal's Director's Cut, re-cut it, and shot some more scenes himself. Is it any wonder that, as Tommy Wallace relates, everybody felt \\"underwhelmed\\" by the prospect of \\"Halloween II?\\" \\"Halloween II\\" is actually more adequate than most sequels, but that's really not saying much positive in its favor.<br />  To be fair, Carpenter and Hill did create a sequel that FEELS and plays like a LOGICAL extension of \\"Halloween\\". The sequel begins mere MOMENTS after the end of \\"Halloween\\" (thus, making this particular Halloween night, played out over TWO movies, the longest one in cinema history).  Dr. Loomis  (Donald Pleasence) has shot Michael Myers.  He runs outside to the lawn but the body has vanished. In a deliciously funny bit, the next door neighbor who so obviously ignored Laurie's (Jamie Lee Curtis) screams for help, finally comes out and yells off-camera, \\"What is going on? I've been Trick or Treated to death tonight.\\" Pleasence seriously replies,  \\"You don't know what death is!\\".<br />  \\"Halloween\\" was all about good, honest, horror tension and suspense. With the tension and suspense now gone, \\"Halloween II\\" has nowhere to go except to fall into the \\"Slasher\\" category, which it immediately does. Laurie goes to the hospital. Michael follows her there and starts murdering the alternately unaware or sexually-obsessed hospital staff and a few other hapless citizens. Leo Rossi is a hoot as Bud, the arrogant, foul-mouthed EMT who is anxious to have sex with a tardy nurse. The pair actually get it on (while ON DUTY, no less!). Bud is strangled, and the neglectful, very nude, nurse is gruesomely drowned. Billy, a  handsome hospital orderly played by Lance Guest,  is knocked unconscious when he slips on a floor of blood. Now trapped in the hospital and drugged up on IV medications, Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie is regretfully reduced to a more \\"passive victim\\" role. Pleasence is obligated to remain several steps behind murderous Myers and spout off exposition we've heard before. Pleasence screams, \\"I shot him six times!\\" so often it seems like he screams it sixty times.<br />  \\"Halloween II: Collector's Edition\\" includes Theatrical and TV Versions of the film, two audio commentaries, and enough additional Extras, to make everything worthwhile.  You are hereby warned: All other \\"Halloween\\" Sequels, with the possible exception of \\"Halloween H20\\" should be assiduously avoided, however.e seriously replies,  \\"You don't know what death is!\\".<br />  \\"Halloween\\" was all about good, honest, horror tension and suspense.

B009A3NGF4|5.0|This album is just to good to let pass without mention. True to what I expect from Mumford and Sons while still pushing forward to be fresh and interesting. Both vocals and instrumentals are gorgeous. Worth every penny and then some.<br /><br />This is going into my \\"music to run to\\" collection alongside Sigh No More - there must be some magic in this music because I always run faster and longer when I listen to Mumford and Sons.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book is very interesting. It took me just a few hours to read the entire book. It's one one those items that once you started reading it, you'll have a hard time putting it down. The story is brilliantly narrated. This book should be read by every citizen of this great country
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|the game is a little stupid because it is so easy but it has a relaxing quality about it that makes you want to keep playing and is slightly addicting. there are objectives such as collecting prizes to go into another part of the game. I haven't gotten that far so I couldn't tell you if it is fun or not.
1423124111|4.0|Just wanted to say that I thought this was a great book. Now two things you should keep in mind, when I ordered it off Amazon, it didn't come wrapped in plastic or anything. So when it came, there were some little nicks and scrapes on the dust jacket. Nothing too bad, or enough to make me return it. But you should be aware of that. Also, most of the art inside is for Magic Kingdom only. I guess they just don't make a lot of posters for the other parks; Epcot, AK, DHS. Would rate it a 3.5 overall. Definitely worth it if you get it cheaper then the cover price of $40.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I enjoy this product because you get a variety of opinions.  I usually read the bad opinions first then the good ones to determine what the middle ground is.  I have saved a lot of time, anguish, and money by reading the reviews.  I have also found some excellent eating places and adorable bed & breakfast inns.  I recommend this app because of the variety of opinions.  Most people truthfully list their experiences and sometimes you don't get a second chance to make a good first impression; so I appreciate knowing who is on their game the majority of the time so I have a good time the first time.
B0011Z3DAC|1.0|I've been a fan of them for a long time, however when the changed their sound, I hoped that they might get their sound back. Unfortunately, they are stuck with ballads. If they ever did a reanimation-Esq album, it would be great if they added a dubstep nu-rock twist. But only time will tell if the will keep on sounding like U2.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A very easy read that has a cliff hanger at the end of every chapter, you just can't wait to find out what happens next!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this site always find something to make gearing up for halloween decorations love the milk jug ghost faces cant wait ti make them
0345803485|5.0|This is a must read book, I have heard nothing but good things about this book and I was very pleased with the timely manner this book was delivered and in such good condition. Just know that this book is risque and is not for everyone. Know that it is a very detailed account of sexual encounters. Know what you are getting yourself into, but very well written and in my opinion a must read! I'm not much of an avid book reader but when I find a good book, such as Fifty Shades of Grey, I can't put the book down. This book has surpassed my expectations and I definitely plan on buying the rest of the trilogy! :)
B008HK3XYK|4.0|I just ordered this case, but I understand the problem everyone is complaining about, as I had the same problem with a Samsung tablet/case.  I don't know why the case manufacturer doesn't take into account that you may need to reverse the tablet in the case for one reason or another, and make cutouts for either direction, whether they're used or not.  I have the $45 Kindle branded case, and it kinda sucks.  It doesn't have the strap, which is REALLY nice for holding the device one handed.  You stick your fingers  under the strap, which also holds the case open.  Try it!  Also, the stand is pretty lame and doesn't offer much in angles.  Also, someone here mentions that the case will wake up when you open it, regardless of which way the unit is placed in the holder.  Try it!  The reality is, for most people - or at least me, I suppose - I usually use the device in portrait mode and rarely landscape mode.  Typically, only on a plane while watching a movie, perhaps.  I rarely need to charge the device while using it.  If I do, I can live with just rotating it in the case while I'm doing this.  I can use on-screen controls for volume.<br /><br />I will do an update on this case when I get it, but I also have to thank them for making it in colors.  I got an orange one, because red or purple is too feminine.  My problem is, I have black leather seats in my car and black floormats, and dark surfaces in my house, so I often \\"lose\\" black things on them.  Crappy eyesight, perhaps.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Pretty much cheap junk.  It works, but its flimsy feeling and cheap looking.  Not impressed, and it doesn't turn off/on the Kindle Fire HD.  I got a much better one for $8 that rocks.  The brand is called \\"Poetry\\" or \\"Poetic\\", I forget.  It has a thick hand-strap, shuts on/off when opened and closed, and has a nice feel to it.
B0067Q04AM|2.0|Don't understand why there is such a rumour about this production? It's such a boring... If You want something more than just a couple of friendly tunes, try Detroit Experiment produced by Carl Craig. Timeless!<br />ps; sorry for my english :)
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I have  read all  of blake crounchs book . this book was ok ,the ending was not what i expected. He is a great writer and no matter what he writes i will always read. i wish he would write more books instead of short stores,very talented writer.
B008H6GHL0|5.0|Always likes the resident evil games and movies even though they really don't follow closely to the games. Either way its a good movie. Decent plotline and my favorite character Leon is in it. Obviously the guy who gave this a one star is either a complete idiot or has an elaborate way of storytelling just to give this a bad review.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The season starts off with a bang but then kind of drags after the first episode until about mid season. However, this is excused for good reason.  Lots of character development this season!  You have to care about these characters to care if they live or die right?  This will cause you to absolutely love some of them or hate them and want to see them go.  If the first season was full of action it was because it was only 6 episodes.  This being a full 13 episode season, nothing seems rushed and is extremely satisfying.  I am one of the graphic novel fans out there that LOVE the show and don't try to compare the two.  They are their own entities and the show beautifully compliments the books.  The last two episodes are AMAZING and entertainment does not get any better.  Can't wait for season 3!!!
1451627297|5.0|I must admit I have not read every Stephen King novel. I am well on my way but still have avoided some of his lengthy ones. ie \\"The Stand\\", \\"IT\\". But I have read \\"The Tommyknockers\\", \\"Duma Key\\", \\"Under The Dome\\". 11/22/63 is probably my second favorite King book ever. With \\"Bag Of Bones\\" coming in 1st place so far, with \\"The Stand\\" & \\"IT\\" in the next read list that could all change. But nevermind those books right now I want to talk about 11/22/63, King starts of by introducing us to a character not much different that some of us. He loves his job but definitely is looking for a change. It doesn't take long to grab the reader as King takes on a wonderful ride full of suspense. I highly recommend this book to anyone, even my mother who hates scary books. This isn't a scary book, its almost more of a Science Fiction than horror. Pick it up you won't be disappointed.
0061992860|1.0|The content of the book seems good but the book arrived severly bent. I had to hammer it out on the table and still is in a weird shape. Not sure why I receved a book that is in worse condition than most used books when I purchased a new book. Giving 1 star and probably will return for a new one.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I must admit I went into this blind. I assumed that I was purchasing a Harry Bosch short story collection. I was little disappointed to find out that he wasn't in any of these three stories. With that said, I really enjoyed the short stories. I am a huge Stephen King and Michael Connelly fan. Both of whom are awesome short story writers. If you enjoy a good long book with character development then the short story isn't for you. But in these three stories you find out a lot about the characters in a short time. The only problem I have is it just made me hungrier for the [[ASIN:0316069434 The Black Box (Harry Bosch)]] than I already am. I can't wait till November 26, 2012!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is as fun as at the arcade! A great stress reliever! So much fun! The board is agitate too!
B006MW3VGA|5.0|My wife and I loved this series.We can't wait for season three.  We wonder what will become of Mr. Bates.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of 'Sigh No More' and have been waiting with impatience for 'Babel'. I was not disappointed. Mumford came out and said that there will be very little difference between this and their first album. Something I was very happy to hear. A lot times bands will capitalize on their success by changing their formula. What makes Mumford & Sons work is their original bluegrass sound.<br /><br />This album is a continuation of 'Sign No More'. It takes that sound from that album and continues it and makes you yearn for more.<br /><br />I am already in love with this album and cannot wait for more to come.
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading the 50 shades of grey series, i was feening for another book to take it's place. After reading all the reviews and trying a free sample of the book i was worried and a lil bit angry. To me, it had too many simuliarities to 50 shades.I decided to purchase the book anyways with the hopes that i could get over the simularities. I'd have to say that one of the major differences is that there is no B.D.S.M in this book like there is in 50 and the sex scenes are written much better. Can't wait to see what happens in the next book.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|i saw this in theatres and now bought a copy. made me laugh so hard, i almost came. very crude humor. plot was very interesting also.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written and quite interesting. My husband read it to and enjoyed it as well. I recommend it highly to those who enjoy military books.
B009B51K9U|1.0|so much for $5 deal which I went for this a.m. ... this is great LP, but Amazon is offering the \\"cleaned up\\" version for $5 ... which sucks ... my dumb mistake
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A friend told me about this app and I've been using it on laptop and nook color. I save recipes and homescool sites the most, but now that I have smart phone will utilize list feature more.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I have heard everyone talking about this show and how great it is. We have only watched 3 episodes--we are hooked-- it is so unexpected and great to watch. We love it.<br />Can not wait to see more
B00932A2MC|4.0|A bit cheesy but great special effects. Not many slow parts would watch again...great looking guys for main characters.... Rhianna surprisingly not too bad as an actress.
B005ES0XQY|5.0|I just could not see what other people saw in this product until I tried it myself. My loss! They are fabulous !
B0002IQNAG|4.0|The dead are walking the earth and eating the living. Stephen and his girlfriend Francine work at a TV station, where they decided to steal the station's helicopter to find someplace safe form the zombie menace. Roger and Peter are SWAT team operatives that are forced to kill the dead that a group of people decided to store in their apartment's basement instead of taking them to the authorities to be disposed of. Together, these two groups of people escape Philadelphia and stop at a shopping mall because it seems like a fortified, safe place to hide out for a while. Who knows how long the mall will remain a relatively safe place or how long it will take other people to discover it.<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead is an interesting and important film in modern zombie history. There are things I love about and things I don't love about it. Let's start with what I like. It was made on a really small budget, but the effects and sets look pretty amazing. The zombie makeup ended up looking more blue than gray, but the blood and gore effects plus a lot of the stunts look really good. It's a pretty gory film compared to Night of the Living Dead and, thanks to the genius and ingenuity of Tom Savini, most of the effects look top notch. Many of them were improvised and some even use animal organs to create an authentic look. They also filmed on location in a mall in Monroeville that you can still visit today. The mall looks really creepy with no one in it but zombies. The mannequins look ominous and it just seems oppressive and overpowering.<br /><br />I also really like the conflicting tones and the strong message within the film. One on hand, there are some really funny and lighthearted scenes with Roger and Peter messing with the zombies or all of them taking advantage of the luxuries in the mall. There are also scary and depressing scenes like the SWAT team raid in the beginning. Those people in the apartment building just wanted their dead to have some dignity and it backfired on them, getting them killed by their departed loved ones and the SWAT team. The difference in tone puts me a little off balance and feels different than zombie films today. Zombie films categorized as comedy tend to have some serious moments, but stay away from the truly depressing stuff. The commentary is biting and direct in its criticism of our society. The scene where zombies aimlessly mill around while the PA system tells them of deals is an obvious stab at the consumerism of our society and how it makes us no better than those brainless zombies. The four main characters aren't heroes, but are simply survivors. They don't really make an effort to save others and they use the mall as a way of escaping horrific reality in their moments of hedonism. They also tend to make their decisions based on emotion rather than logic, which proves never to be a good idea in a zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />I did not like some aspects of this film. The pacing feels odd and there are definite plot holes. The acting leaves something to be desired, but it's kind of part of its cheesy charm. I really didn't like the woman or the way she was treated in the film. She, like Barbara from Night of the Living Dead, is completely useless and incapacitated by emotion to the point of literally doing nothing as a zombie comes near her. It's just frustrating to watch her not even move out of the way. She was left out of a lot of the action scenes because she stays behind, by herself usually with no weapons. I guess it's better than Barbara's constant hysterics, but it still irked me. The only intelligent thing she did was have her boyfriend teach her how to operate the helicopter in case something happened it him. There is a tiny scene that annoyed me because it didn't need to be there and the implications are troubling. Peter asks Stephen if he wants to abort Francine's baby. I thought it was weird and basically saying that these men are in control of her body. It's nice that the topic ofabortion was brought up because Roe vs. Wade had happened not too long before that. However, the subject really wasn't explored or developed at all and this teeny tiny mention was just more problematic than it was worth.<br /><br />This film and the original Night of the Living Dead set up many of the conventions and tropes we see even today in the zombie genre, both the good and the bad. So many of the zombie movies today have homages or responses to this film. I'm glad I watched it and it's important in the scope of the history of the modern zombie, but it wasn't my favorite film of the genre.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|This is a great value for the buck.  As far as the packaging it is cardboard but cute.  Don't expect much of the \\"bottle,\\" I am sorry but the packaging is flimsy.  I plan to use a rubber band to keep mine together.  The DVDs themselves are in paper sleeves.  I am glad I was able to get this entire series for such a bargain price!! MUCH cheaper than buying each season separately!!

B008XG1X18|5.0|it works GREAT on kindle fire. everything is easy to access and it lets you pin unlike the other apps
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Bought this app for my toddler to play with on my phone, she loved it! She would do the puzzles over and over until she had mastered or memorized all of them I eventually had to buy the other puzzles by this app maker, they are wonderful too.
0399534601|3.0|I like this book more every time I pick it up. When I first opened it and flipped through the pages I was slightly disappointed. The structure of the book seemed like it was put together slapdash without any real thought, and it seemed to me that all of the fun pictures were there to serve the purpose of filling in blank space.<br /><br />After giving the book several chances it started to grow on me and I realized that its real purpose was to make the reader start thinking in a different way by challenging the reader to complete odd tasks, or at least tasks that are out of the ordinary. One of the books main challenges is to get the reader, or explorer, to start recognizing patterns in an every day environment. The book challenges the reader to do this in many different ways, and starts t to seem redundant. When I realized that most of the exercises were designed to achieve the same goal, I felt a little cheated. However, after thinking about it more, I suppose repetition is necessary when learning something new. Especially when that something is a new way to think.<br /><br />On the whole, I enjoy the book. Though I think that it would have been better with half the pages and half the price.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was very grateful to read this book.  Learning about the Seals and the tremendous dedication and focus it takes to be one was fascinating.  A big thanks to the author for telling the truth regarding the demise of Bin Laden, especially since most of us prefer truth over speculation of the media.<br /><br />And I really appreciate his giving away most of the funds from his book to help armed forces members--his consistency is honorable and laudable.
B006DZYM0A|3.0|This movie is something you won't enjoy watching but also won't have the nerve to call it a failure, simply because the movie seems to have come from good intentions.<br /><br />It follows a young high school girl (played by an almost 30-years old actress) who, unwillingly, causes a bus accident during which a woman dies. For over two hours we then follow the girl's spiritual suffering and trying to make it right for the memory of the dead woman while firing her coincidental and teenage angst at her mother.<br /><br />If you liked Gotz Spillman's \\"Revanche\\" or Von Trier's \\"Breaking Waves,\\" you probably are not going to like this one.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This has been a favorite of mine for a long time.  Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are superb and the score, dialog and scenery are a treat.  The work and experience involved in moving and filming the animals in this film are a remarkable achievement in themselves.  Even a 'non-western' person will like it.  I think everyone should own a copy to remind them of what it was like for those who settled our country, did so much hard work and sacrificed so much.  This performance is tough and tender, sweet and sour, beautiful and ugly, terrible and wonderful.  The special features are all right; mostly behind the scenes extras and actor commentary.  Having owned this as a VCR tape from ages past and now seeing it in a digital format, I am very pleased with it.  It's even better than I remember.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|I got this for my 5 year old, who loves Doctor Who almost as much as his dad. The black cap and little pieces were all lost within a day, of course. What's left of it has lasted a month, so far, so I guess it's more durable than it looks. It looks and feels rather cheap and if it wasn't an official Doctor Who product, it would cost about $5.  Still, if you want it, what choices do you really have?
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Lee Child produces another action-packed Jack Reacher tale, faithful to his successful template. Perhaps for the first time Reacher ends his involvement with some background unresolved or unexplained, but this is more a nag at the back of the mind than a turn-off.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game on my phone. love it more now that I can also play it on my kindle fire. a musty have game for everyone.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|To anyone familiar with a token/ticket arcade, these coin machines will look familiar.  The game play is simplistic, drop coins and hope the coins you drop push other coins over the edge.  Coin Dozer takes the basic idea of these machines and adds tons of replay value via prizes and puzzles.  Unless you are willing to shell out real money, you'll run out of coins quickly.  I consider this a good thing, because it gives me a reason to stop (for a while).
B009329ZF2|5.0|I thought this was an excellent scifi movie.  The plot was well done and the acting was decent.  I didn't realize it was based on the game until I saw it in the credits.  This movie is sort of like Transformers only much better.
0385344228|5.0|I grabbed this book because Amazon recommended based off other purchases. I was not disappointed. William Landay has a new fan thanks to Amazon.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Love this show! Human instinct survival, it's so realistic! Can't wait for Season 3 to begin, so ready to watch it now!!!
0345803485|5.0|I really did not get the hype that this book caused. It drug you through 500+ repeatative, poorly written pages only to end like it was ending a chapter just so you would run out and buy the other books. Had the book been half as long (as it should have been because the characters repest the same conversations over and over)I probably would have liked it more. Waste of my time.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|The sludge blues sound is perfected on this record for the second time in down's career. What im saying is that they were one thing when they perfected it with NOLA but now they're something different. a slight reinvention.<br />So the bass is great, sad to see Rex gone but replacement Pat Bruders might be even bigger shoes to fill if he ever leaves. Maybe. What I really enjoy on this new EP is the lyrics. Phil is on another level. A new level, if you will. Every riff on this slab is fantastic and oozing with blue sludge. Blue sludge to represent blues and sludge metal. hahaha anyway, I just think if youre a Down fan you wont regret buying this. It's killer.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|great show and worth the money! was able to watch it before season 5 started so was ready for it! wish netflix would have had it but this worked just as well.
B000268RK2|4.0|Mainly interested in the 2nd CD - You Make Loving Fun/Second Hand News (1977) - Fleetwood Mac. Stereo. Hard to tell if these are actual \\"Roughs & Outtakes\\" or the multi-track tapes were crudely remixed using previously unused tracks and/or portions. Not many were wasting away expensive, 24+ track, magnetic recording tape. One song restarts, while the other contains a count-off. Either way, they are interesting to listen to!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Although I have not completed the book yet, I find it very interesting and have even more respect for the fighting men who are<br />and were involved in the capture and death of Bin Laden.  Bin Laden did not care about the injury or harm he inflicked on the U.S.<br />The seals of today and yesterday are an elite group of our wonderful fighting men and women in the service.  The book brings to reality the hard work and dedication of our service personnel.  I do not feel the book has said or given away any secrets that are not commonly know about their actions.  Why even Obama in the days after the action told where our men lived and the Team number allowing many of those in Va. Beach to wonder how safe we are with this knowledge in the world.<br />The author of this book brings me along as if we are right there with him in this world.  I find for me this is a great read.
B00689ILQC|1.0|...but it is a long, LONG way from music in the true, honest sense. What do we have here? Generic beats, overly raunchy lyrics, autotuned pitch-corrected vocals, mass over-production... definitely a picture-perfect example of everything that is wrong with the music industry today. Style, image and familar-sounding tracks (not songs), all carefully designed with the sole intent to sell to the masses.<br /><br />Nothing on this album is anything we have never heard before. Plus, akin to a lot of pop albums these days, all you see on this album cover is Rihanna's overly stuck-up, pompous face. The focus on the image over the actual music is so obvious it is not even funny. Honestly, why do people still listen to and talk about albums like Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" or The Pretenders' self-titled debut, or Enya's \\"Watermark\\" or Judas Priest's \\"British Steel\\" or Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" even to this day? Because they all stand as shining, relevant moments of innovation and originality in music history, and made to LAST throughout the ages. It is the same thing with the jazz masters and every classical composer ever to exist. Can the same ever be said about this generic atrocity? Hardly, lol...<br /><br />Allow me to return to Kamelot, Vangelis, Midwarp Chamber, Van Hunt, Tarja Turunen, Immortal Technique, Vital Remains, Richard Wagner, John Coltrane, and countless other REAL artists who do not make music just to sell, and do not resort to perverted raunchiness just to get attention. Ignorance is bliss indeed.

B008KEQM3W|5.0|My husband and I have been in the character Elizabeth Banks played for nearly two and a half years (as far as the trying). We found ourselves laughing at some of the things she did before she got pregnant and after she got pregnant. We found ourselves bawling when Rosie suffered a miscarriage as we just did on a very planned pregnancy about 6 weeks ago. He's a father already so he laughed at things some of the women did. Definitely a good couple movie whether you're trying or already have kids.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good game love it kids love nice game to let kids play no shooting,killing, bad words etc. recommend. for your family
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than the 1st fifty shades novel. I am looking forward to the 2nd novel in hopes it only gets better and better.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is a great way to waste time. the game has some small glitches but they are easily over looked. I downloaded it for the kindle fire and I enjoy it
1439102430|4.0|Ms. Reichs delivers another page turner.  Bones are Forever is fun and full of the technical detail and witty reparte that I have come to enjoy.  I do have to disagree with the publisher's claim that it was \\"crackling with sexual tension.\\"  Ryan and Tempe had very little interaction in the book (very little of which was personal), much less tension.  I, personally, would like to see more Tempe/Ryan relationship progression.
B008N5UX9M|4.0|The early reviews of this album are a bit harsh IMO.  First off, its true that the lead vocals are not that strong but they are not exactly garbage either.  I mean, the leader singer definitely has his shortcomings and I cant imagine him producing a strong live performance but at least on the album its ok. If you expected a Bruce Dicksinson like singer here then you will be disappointed.  They just dont have Bruce Dickinson like singers growing on trees.  Steve should have done Blaze Bayley a proper here and let him sing lead on this project.<br /><br />Personally I'm just going to assume that maybe Steve Harris just wanted to make a 70s/80s style hard rock album and get away from making a Maiden like project.  Some good rock tunes on this album.  A World Without Heaven sticks out as a strong, almost progressive rock type song.  Us Against the World is a solid ballad.  Eyes of the Young definitely has a bit of an 80s vibe to it.<br /><br />My major complaint is the production of the album.  It just sounds muddy and bland.<br /><br />Now while this album doesn't break any new ground I find it an enjoyable hard rock album.  Better production and maybe stronger vocals would have made it even more enjoyable.  Personally I see this album as something that grows on you as you get past the Maiden expectation.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Can&rsquo;t get any better than this game. I played it at a friends house and loved it. later when I got home I got it and have been playing it ever since. a must get!
B00956UPSW|5.0|There was a part of me that was disappointed Down would be releasing just an EP for their first album in awhile.  I guess they plan on releasing a total of 4 EP in the next year or so.  If they are like The Purple EP then its going to be a good thing.  A straight up kickass album.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I really liked the first three books and was excited to move on to the fourth. Before buying the fourth book, I read some of the reviews and started to wonder if I was going to be wasting my time. I figured I should give the book a chance and form my own opinion. After finishing the book, I realized that I had no idea what all the negative reviews were talking about. Sure it wasn't quite as action-packed as the first three books and it introduced some new unfamiliar characters, but overall I liked it. I thought it was worth reading and am excited to move on to the fifth book. If you are on the fence about it, I say give it a chance.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|excellent graphics-nice story line<br />challenging liked the fact it was longer than most other ho apps I've played on kindle fire<br />eager to play sequel
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I'm a 51 year old black guy.  I have no business liking a Pink album.  But, I love Pink.  She makes me want to be young again.  I don't even turn the radio on with all the pop garbage being put out these days.  But, Pink is a true talent.  First of all, the girl can sing.  When she strips it down and sings a ballad, you realize how great of a singer she really is. And, while this album is full of fun songs that will make you want to get up and move, Pink also captures the ins and outs, ups and downs, joy and pain of being in love, being out of love just being in lust.<br /><br />If you like Pink at all, don't even hesitate.  just get this album.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I couldnt wait to use this app on my new Kindle Fire HD. The app downloaded quickly and opened quickly.And that was it. unable to login. I get an error message regarding my internet connection but I can do anything else with my connection. So the app is useless to me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great book and good insight into how a young girl handles being in a war.  People young and old will appreciate the trilogy.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|These stories are an excellent read. There are many words that keep me going to the dictionary for a prpoper explanation of their meaning. After watching all the old movies with Basil Rathbone, and enjoying them very much, the characters are even more life like.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game really addictive my wife can not stop playing I also enjoy playing it and my kids like it too.
B004UHF51S|3.0|I've followed Michael Franks since the beginning and in general I love his music, but this particular album to me was medicore at best. I think I own just about every album he has released. His voice is smooth and alluring as usual. Except for a couple of tracks, I did not like the songs. The arrangements, although technically impeccable, were not remarkable.
B008BIZ06M|4.0|Great new songs, they are back! Really like \\"Hurting as One\\", \\"Dividing by Zero\\", and \\"Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing and Rides the Bomb to Hell\\".
B002GYI9C4|5.0|II love the character development. Sanderson develops the core human conflict of trust like few do. I love it. He is becoming my go to author for my recreational reading. Thank you Brandon.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Maybe a little early on in the game for a review but runs fine on kindle fire and is entertaining so far.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I paid to have my girls and I see this in the theater when it was broadcast live. I was overjoyed to see it on disc, and bought it. Worth every penny, and have watched it several times. The sound track is on permanent rotation on my ipod, and I just hope it will still be around when I wear out both the dvd and cd set. I will need to stock up!
B006JJBFK0|5.0|Excellent!!! just great!! what else can i say? I wasn´t expecting such a superb record from this guys. Though already a Xandria fan, the music in this cd took them to another level. If you´re changing your vocalist, make sure you get an even better one, that´s the rule this guys seem to have followed (are you listening Nightwish?) I like Lisa´s voice a lot, but Manuela has a more powerful and even more beautiful voice, and the best of all is she infected that power to the whole band, the guitars are taking more risks, the bass line is stronger, the songs are better than ever and you can´t find any weak spot. It looks like these guys finally have decided to get a more important role in the symphonic metal world. Get on your feet and buy it right away, may be the best spent bucs of the whole year!
B009329Y30|4.0|This was good, but predictable.  It was obvious a great deal was left out, as some scenes just seemed to end and did not transition very well.  I downloaded the book to my digital reader and will read soon- I expect the book will be a much better story.
B00705GEO4|4.0|Sabaton delivers a good option in power metal with their latest work Carolus Rex. The vocals are powerful and different from what we´re used to in power metal, the guitars are fine, the rhythm section is strong enough and the keys complement it all. With interesting lyrics and a well chosen sequence, everything seems in place, except sometimes this power metal exactly lacks a little power.<br /><br />For me the highlights are:<br /><br />Killing Ground<br />Carolean´s prayer<br />The Lion from the north<br />Gott mit uns
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very addictive game I love it- i completeded all the puzzles and really wish there were more to do - am thinking about starting all the way over again just so it can be a challenge again
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really liked it.I went a bought the last book of the trilogy.It left me wanting more!<br />I Am really into the 3rd book mockingjay,I can not put it down.<br /><br />I hope there will be more to come after this saga!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy this game, and the new update made it A WHOLE LOT!!! Even if you had to pay for this it would be worth it. It's just a fun thing to do during your past time.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I like her use of words,but not the subject matter.But it did reinforce my feeling about this subject.Maybe if the why she like this was detail more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is the last installment of the Hunger Games trilogy, and carries an amazing story to a logical, heart rending conclusion. I am a senior citizen male, professional, and read the three books twice within three weeks because the story really resonated with my understanding of life.  Being thrust into a situation without intention, yet responding with character and determination. Trying to maintain personal values and universal empathy while maintaining a fragile sense of survival and self.  Rising to great heights of respect and adulation with no intention of self glorification.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a study of responding to extraordinary circumstances while trying terribly to remain focused on who you are and what you value.  I enjoyed it immensely.  If you liked the first or second book, you will love this story, and hate to see it end.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Love this show and it keeps getting better and better. Noah, Drew, Connor, and Maxim are my favorite characters. Each one builds on the individual personality of their character. Working well together and the plots just keep you coming back for more. It's my number one favorite series, as well as Person of Interest, and Psych. Thank you so much writers, directors, and my favorite actors of the show for giving me such amazing TV entertainment! Falling Skies Fan!!!!
B008VBYN80|2.0|This app looked very fun. It downloaded quickly and held promise.<br />Then came the blue screen of death. It freezes my device and will not finalize the start up protocols.<br />After several forced re-starts, this app has been uninstalled.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Built upon first book.  Pulled the story together. Excellent book. A must read. Don't know what else needs to be said.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this game is cool but the coins are hard to get through. the items are hard to get also but its ok.
B007P7UF0G|2.0|I cannot possibly dislike the music in this film.  It is excellent in all respects.  No problems with that.  However, the storyline of this movie, at least for me was a little too dull and somewhat pointless.  I tried to watch it with an open mind, because I love Richard Harris.  However, I feel Harris was somewhat miscast here.  He is not terribly dynamic or interesting in this movie.  Nor do I particularly care for Vanessa Redgrave in this film.  I think her acting got better as she got older.<br /><br />I think perhaps that on stage, this was probably an excellent musical, but it did not translate well into a film.  I'm hard-pressed to put my finger on exactly why.  For some reason, the story is not interesting or moving enough to be impressed with.  Some of the script is funny, it is true.  Then, other parts of the script could have been much better.  The movie itself seems to wander about with no real purpose or plot.  Even though I watched it all the way through, it did not hold my interest after the first hour.  I realize that other reviewers think this musical is the best thing since sliced bread, but this movie did not make sense to me.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This is the Temple of Pharaoh and I love the sound effects,  background and colored balls.  Only thing is you can't switch colors like in Bubble Shoot.  Otherwise,  a great time-passer.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|As always Kurt Sutter has done an amazing job. Season 4 is a close second to being my favorite season although 5 could change all of that with how it's looking so far. I couldn't be happier about being an owner of seasons 1-4. I'm a full blooded fan and will be preordering season 5 from Amazon as soon as it's available. Can't get enough SOA!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is simply amazing, once you start reading you won't put it down.. I watched the movie first, but the book is absolutely a lot better.. I love thr details and how the author is able to express the caracther's feelings so clear.... Love it!
B009329ZF2|4.0|It's a nice action movie, with a funny beginning and a bittersweet ending. Perhaps the acting wasn't as great as I would've liked, but the movie has good entertainment value.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|This book stays with you long after the reading. It calls to you so that you have to go back and reread a particular passage to emerse yourself in this world again.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|Normally I dont leave such a long review, but for this I had to...<br /><br />The movie, if you have not read the book, is good.  Its action packed!  It's a different kind of move with lots of eye catching scene's.  However, if you have read the book...get ready!<br /><br />Once the film was over...I was actually angry!  I feel they did a HUGE disservice to the book, the author and mainly the characters.  It's like talking about history and saying that the World War's were just wars, talking about the depression as just a hard time,  saying Romeo & Juliet were just trying to tick their parents off and were not really in love.  Yes it kept with the `Main' premise of Panam & the Hunger Games, but it couldn't tie them together at all since they left all the relationships out of the film.  Furthermore they tried to tie up the main book in one movie when it should have been in 2 parts (good on twilight directors for doing this).  They left out the main relationships with Katniss and Gale (they were not just friends & not just teenagers), Katniss and her mother (why Katniss hated her mother), Katniss & the village (btw that mockinjay pin-NOT BOUGHT AT THE HOB!), the whole train scene which is a HUGE part of the story that sets the stage for everything between Peeta and Katniss & Katniss & her Prep Crew/Cinna, & Katniss/Peeta & Haymitch. I mean even Effie was cut in half with her relationships!  I was furious at the way they in the film took Katniss & Peeta's relationship and made it look superficial, forced and only for show!  It should have said LOOSLEY BASED ON MAJOR  EVENTS IN THE BOOK. I will try not to give up too much but I feel like if you buy this movie you should know all the stuff they left our and the superficial way they made this deep movie (shame on the directors).<br /><br />Katniss & her sister were STARVING-almost to the point of death because their father was killed in a mining explosion and their mother 'checked out'.  The mom literally wouldn't move, no dinner, no taking care of her small children, she just zoned out after the dad was killed.  So Katniss was trying to sell anything they owned for any food and no one would help, no one would even look at the 'seam kid=trash'.  She was in the pouring rain, skin and bones trying to sell some threadbare clothing for any food possible when Peeta came out to feed the pigs at their house in the village.  They were the bakers in the village.  Peeta saw the starving girl, took pity on her, and went back into the bakery (don't want to give away too much so skipped some detail in here), came out and threw her some loaves of burned bread.  They took in each other for a while and then she left and was able to feed herself and her sister.  She even `made' her mother eat something.<br /><br />Katniss & Gale-they met on accident in the woods and became hunting partners as she could use a bow like an extension of her own arm  & she knew what plants were for what, as her father taught her.  Gale was a master at traps, had strength and was a fierce protector.  The forged a friendship based on need.  That grew into a friendship of trust, respect, need and a bond in which few know-they would protect each other at all costs and their families.  Only one of them was in love with the other.  Katniss was the only reason her family didn't starve and die.<br /><br />After the Reaping in the rooms BEFORE they were carted off in the train Peeta's dad came to see Katniss and not his son.  He brought Katniss cookies for the trip and told her that he would make sure that her sister wouldn't starve.  That this stranger to her and her family would do this really hit home with Katniss.  This is another detail that later will be needed.<br /><br />The train ride was HUGE!  This was as important as the Games in my opinion!  This is where Peeta (the whole time) showed that he was pure of heart, genuinely a good person, protective of Katniss (which no one knew why), take charge in a way people just listened and normally agreed.  He was very persuasive, had a way with people and Katniss was having a real issue not liking him.  He did little things here and there, tried to help her here and there, protected her against Haymitch and took care of things that as a Tribute shouldn't have cared about for his competition.  He said through it all that he wouldn't let the Capital change him, he would be him to the end even if it ended up killing him.  He wouldn't give them the satisfaction, he was very passive aggressive in a good way.  He has a huge personality that you don't realize until he is actually worked his way to you, LOL.  This was a VERY deep character!  Katniss and him have lots of different interactions that develop into other things later.  Unfort, most will see these as shallow since they didn't include any of this.  Peeta is a very genuine, caring, good person, and the movie made him seem very shallow and blah.<br /><br />During the training, there was so much left out & other things that were not even in the book...I.E. they were told by Haymitch to NOT show what they were good at!  They were to only show that to the judges at the end when the other tributes were not around.  There was a reason for this which they didn't show either.  This whole scene to me felt forced and very awkward like they were ad-libbing their lines.<br /><br />The prep crews were very intricate throughout the train & training, where Katniss formed bonds with these people and how they transformed her `painfully' into what she became.  In the film you didn't understand WHY on earth she would cling to Cinna who was just a stylist for an outfit for the hunger games, a Capital person who was putting her into this death situation...because they left all the stuff on the train out.  It looked forced and out of place.  This will need to be known later or parts to come wont make a bit of sense.<br /><br />Haymitch, they really did this character incorrect.  Haymitch is a JERK!  HUGE JERK!  There are reasons why but I don't want to give it away.  He was a severe drunk, couldn't hardly walk or move about, and constantly drunk (I mean drunk & falling off stages).  He was abrasive, crude, rude, obnoxious, & loud.  His interaction with Katniss is so rude, that you wonder why he is so mean to her.  Peeta has to take care of him a couple times as he is such a jerk.  He is not at all what is portrayed in the movie.  It took Peeta & Katniss almost going after him to get him to agree to a truce to train them.  In the movie, he didn't seem that bad.  NO he is a JERK (there are reasons which are not going to make sense later).<br /><br />When they do the chariot part I was horrified when they did the whole hand scene!  It was forced, shallow and was only for show!  Peeta did this as he was trying to calm Katniss, it was a genuine act of friendship to help her out, NOT FOR SHOW! She liked it in a way and she didn't understand why he was so nice.  It made them strong together.  By this time she was really starting to trust him, and his judgment which they totally didn't show throughout this.  Their relationship wasn't defined yet but there was something whether friendship, need, strength, like, whatever, but there was definitely something there, not just for show.  I actually yelled at the TV (WHAT) when he said that!<br /><br />Peeta wanted to protect Katniss so much that he was with the Careers as a strategy to protect her, knowing they would attack her first and he could stop them. The scenes in the Arena looked forced between Peeta & Katniss where the book was very smooth (because the book showed the relationship before and the movie tried to just add it in).  They related to each other, they depended on each other, they looked out for each other, they formed a stronger bond based upon their growing relationship.  It was not forced, it was not shallow, it was not just for show.  Then when she did kiss him, they totally made that SHALLOW.  That kiss was not shallow, it totally shook them both up!  Here again they took out the feeling of the book.  After this point Katniss didn't know what to think, she just knew something was different.  The last scene in the arena, was again forced (it was with no feeling), where the book had feeling!  I don't want to say because it's a major part, but it was not like the book at all especially the scene after.<br /><br />The mockingjay pin really ticked me off.  Katniss didn't buy it at the hob.  She was given it by her only `girl' friend.  She was so surprised and moved at this gesture.  She didn't even realize how much of a friend this girl was until that moment.<br /><br />Casting--Pres. Snow-FANTASTIC casting!  I saw him and immediately knew which character he was.  Same with Gale.  He was just about what I would have expected him to be. Great casting on Gale, totally believable!  Effie, Mom, Cinna, dad, game maker, the other Tributes -again great casting.  Katniss, she looked the part, most of the time she was believable but there was something missing.  Maybe it was that they screwed up the scripts and she was working with what she had.  I wish she had read the book and was more like the Katniss in there, that way I would totally see her in that part.  Haymitch-totally wrong in my opinion.  I love Woody, but not as Haymitch, he is too nice, too good to play a rough, nasty, jerk.  Now again like Katniss...it might have been the script and maybe he didn't read the book to get what Haymitch was really like.  But it was not believable at all to me.  Peeta...oh Peeta...I like this actor...however not as Peeta.  I didn't believe anything about him, not the way he interacted with the people, Katniss, or when he was trying to get her to run.  It all looked forced and out of place, he just didn't convince me he was Peeta.  Peeta & Katniss had NO chemistry whatsoever.  Peeta ended up after the series to be one of my favorite people when I loved Gale from the get go in the book.  They did the biggest disservice to him in my opinion.<br /><br />As a movie on its own, I thought it was good.  However, because I had read the book, been in the lives of these characters and felt what they felt and had been in their heads because of the book I was annoyed all throughout the movie.  They took the feeling out of the characters, and the movie where the books were FULL of feelings (how could they not with children being put into death situations).  I was very disappointed in the director & the author for allowing it.<br /><br />That's my opinion, take it as you may :-)There are reasons why but I don't want to give it away.  He was a severe drunk, couldn't hardly walk or move about, and constantly drunk (I mean drunk & falling off stages).  He was abrasive, crude, rude, obnoxious, & loud.

1594481717|3.0|Well I have had this book several months and still I'm in the middle. I feel like I'm still awaiting to get the meatiest part of the book. It is informative at this point of left brain right brain and is pro both. It seems encouraging for those that are more right and flourish in a more artist way. I'll keep reading to see if it speaks to me in a deeper way. Although several months and it sits on my night stand unopened for more than three weeks.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The hype is all about the hot sex, but actually clear the steam, and the love story is quite romantic.  I look forward to the next two books.  I am hoping for a happy ending.  Meanwhile I am enjoying the scenery.  Brings back a lot of memories...
B000F6IOC0|5.0|this is an ideal movie for vampire fans and scary movie buffs. Very Reasonably priced. Five Stars all the way!!!
B007FG9LIE|1.0|Got really excited in the beginning. I was expecting a crime thriller, and flew through the first half of the book. Then, the book flew the coop and turned it to yet another sappy roll-your-eyes science fiction stories. Sure, I didn't expect the ending, but to be fair, it wasn't all that interesting. It answers all the questions the author posed throughout the book, but it does in such a non-climactic way that I really didn't care. If you're looking for a crime thriller, don't get this book. If you're looking for bad, cheesy sci-fi, get it.
B001HN697M|5.0|this is an excellent movie, very scary and action packed. If you love vampire, werewolves, and horror this ios the movie for you.
B008SVFX96|4.0|Aftermath Of The Lowdown is the highly anticipated third solo album from Richie Sambora and overall it is a strong collection of songs that shows off his beautiful vocal style and his ability to deliver a song with passion. The album was produced by Richie along with Luke Ebbin who made Bon Jovi explode with \\"It's My Life\\" a decade ago. The band consists of session players including Rusty Anderson on guitar who played with Paul McCartney's band and Matt Rollings on keys who played with Lyle Lovett. The song styles are a mixture of hard rockers, radio friendly modern rock, and those passionate ballads that have become Richie's trademark. Highlights include the emotional ballad \\"Weathering The Storm\\" written with legend Bernie Taupin, the amazing chorus vocals of \\"I'll Always Walk Beside You\\", the best song on the album \\"Seven Years Gone\\" which has a mind blowing chorus and also builds into an epic bridge section, the quality hard rocker \\"Learning To Fly With A Broken Wing\\", and the powerful emotional hit of \\"Every Road Leads To You\\". While it doesn't feel quite as unique and intense as Richie Sambora's previous two masterpiece solo albums, Aftermath Of The Lowdown is certainly a quality addition to an amazing body of work that delivers on the promise of emotional vocals that we have come to expect from the bluesman - 4.5 stars.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|How do you rate a book about cancer?  Not usually my first choice for subject matter, however, it is a part of us as much as anything else.  John Green writes a compelling story from a wise young girl's perspective and does a damn good job of it too.  I was completely taken in by the 3 main characters (heroes), straight away due to their ability to cut through the stereotypical attitudes most others adopt when in the company of anyone with a serious illness such as this.  I found it refreshing to be pulled into such devastating honesty.  I hope to be as clear about my place in the world when I near the end.  And to know that no matter how little time or experience we have, we all need and want to risk the agony & ecstasy of love.  Isn't that noble and courageous enough?  A good, thoughtful read.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Power punk trio Green Day return with their brand new album which is the first in a trilogy of inspired music that sees them shift back to the days of their raw rock music filled with passionate vocals. It might not sound like anything groundbreaking but anyone who loves what Green Day do is going to absolutely love this album. It is a collection of amazing songs that makes you feel alive and that makes you want to sing those awesome melodies that Billie Joe brings out on top of his power chords. Mike Dirnt is still one of the best rock bass players and Tre Cool is still hammering those drums like he was when he was twenty. The massive production of their last two albums is stripped back a little and what we get is something more like the Dookie era up till Nimrod where they were just hammering out good simple songs. Highlights include the rocking opener \\"Nuclear Family\\", the catchy chorus hooks of \\"Stay The Night\\", the anthemic chorus of \\"Carpe Diem\\", the hilarious lyrics to \\"Kill The DJ\\", and the passionate vocal delivery of \\"Oh Love\\" where you can even hear the way Billie Joe breathes between verse lines. Uno is quality power punk rock that will easily please any Green Day fan. Who would have thought that Green Day would still be going strong after all these years?! If the other two albums are anywhere near this good we are in for a very satisfying tour from Green Day next year - bring on the trilogy!

B003VANOFY|1.0|These headsets are absolutely and totally WORTHLESS...<br /><br />I bought these because my soundblaster 3D TACTIC SIGMA's wiring has issues.<br /><br />I'll tell you why these headsets are worthless..<br /><br />Sound quality.<br /><br />Awful... I wouldn't even subject my worse enemy to such woeful sound qualities. These headsets have awful base, bring out the highs too much and the sound is just all round woeful.<br /><br />I am a bit of a sound nut, and with my Soundblaster's with the headsets at full volume it will blow your ears apart, with these ones however, it lacks that \\"oooomph\\" and the bass isn't as good as the soundblaster's bass, the soundblaster's bass even if you have its bass set to just 50% on the supplied software, at full volume the bass is more than enough, with these ones however, the bass leaves a lot to be desired plus it gets distorted when you put it to the max level, the soundblaster's did not distort when the bass set to the max from what I remember but you wouldn't want to use it with full bass anyway.<br /><br />-Driver software<br /><br />Awful.<br /><br />It has very little configuration settings for the main ones there's sound mic sound treble bass and midtones.<br /><br />Midtones don't seem to change too much that is noticeable and the bass adjustment is abysmal at best.<br /><br />The actual driver CONSTANTLY crashes on my win7 x64. No shit, I had about 8, 10 maybe 13 crashes within probably 10-20 minutes.<br /><br />These headsets were also more expensive than my soundblaster one's and these headsets are absolutely terrible and were absolutely not worth the purchase price, soundblaster exceeds over these shitty headsets and they are CHEAPER.<br /><br />But hey, at least these are comfortable, but again, my soundblaster headsets were more comfortable than this one, this one pushes in on my ears too much for my liking, while the Soundblaster's feel like someone putting a pillow against my ears.

B007STBUIW|5.0|I saw \\"Jaws\\" when it first came out in 1975 and it changed me. I loved to go to the Beach and always would swim wayyyyyy out there, well, after seeing \\"Jaws\\" back in the day, I no longer did that.<br /><br />This movie really affected people and watching it on this new Blu-Ray with my very large screen and great sound system, just reinforces how good a movie it is. There are a lot of wonderful elements here, but it's the three lead characters I think, that I like most about the movie. This is really everything you go to the movies for.
B0048WQDIE|1.0|I had high hopes for this novel; I mean it's a classic right? My 16 year old son had to choose a novel for summer reading and I helped him pick this book.  The story was very difficult to follow and just jumps right into a confusing hospital scene.  We hung in there and figured that if we kept reading it would eventually piece itself together and make sense. After Chapter 4 I had lost my son entirely and I wasn't too far behind. I rented the movie out of desperation, hoping it would gel a background story that we could carry back to the book.  We couldn't get a third of the way through the movie! There were too many discrepancies between the two and the movie just threw us deeper into confusion.  The book and the movie were very \\"Monty Python\\"-ish only not funny. This was the first time in my 52 years I've ever started a book and not finished it...and I'm surprisingly okay with that.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Totally hooked....loved it, loved it, loved it.  The imagery was amazing.  I lived it! with the characters for the entire weekend!  The characters are amazing!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game am actually kind of addicted can't put it down.  My daughter loves it too we fight over who gets to play it.
B005LAIGYQ|2.0|You remember that scene in the preview where they throw that little remote airplane in the air to surveil enemy territory?  That was awesome.  Or how about the moment where a Seal catches a guy shot in the head so he doesn't make a splashing sound?  Those scenes made me want to see this movie regardless of the fact that I knew it was going to be barefaced cheerleading for American foreign policy.  While there were a few other cool moments in which you felt like you were playing a video game, and some of the gear and tactics were interesting to observe, they really didn't put enough effort into this.  Without enough special effects to make up for it, I was nauseated by the glorification of the wholesome, family-oriented American special ops guys, and the unsophisticated characterization of the shifty-eyed terrorists from hell.  You may as well re-watch True Lies instead of wasting your time on this.
B008D1LVRY|5.0|Love all their stuff!  Lives up to all my expectations. Ready for more!  Hope all future albums are this good!
B008133MDK|5.0|Words fall short - Intrigue, mystery, humor, twists...all mixed perfectly with and extra dose of the quirky loveliness of Jeremy Brett's Sherlock. Martin Freeman is the perfect straight to Benedict Cumberbatch's excentric, the chemistry is amazing. It would be unfair not to mention other frequent actors like brilliant brother Mycroft and malevolent Moriarty - We are so lucky to have access to such high quality entertainment right at home.
B0090EKRKU|4.0|This movie was completely different than what I thought it was going to be about. Not a bad thing, just different. I was pleasantly surprised to find it has a great meaning. It's got some witty humor & memorable characters. Definitely worth a rent, but I would recommend a buy! The kids will surely not be disappointed!
B0091REZMW|5.0|so far this game is a lot of fun. no need to spend real money at all to be able to play. just be patient and your energy refilled in time. it's a free game so naturally they're going to charge you for certain things, otherwise how would they make any money to create new games? it's totally optional to spend money, not required.
B001R6AW18|5.0|This is the best that this movie has ever (and probably will ever) look. I doubt that the original release in 1933 looked this good. There is no substitute for the original....<br />EDIT: This is refering to the Blu-ray edition.[[ASIN:B001KVZ6LQ King Kong [Blu-ray Book]]]
B009B51K9U|4.0|Bought the new Green Day this morning and it's definitely a fun album. I'd agree with several of the other reviewers that it's no American Idiot or 21st Century Breakdown but it's still a good addition to their catalogue. GD doesn't change their sound all that much from album to album so you know what you're going to get. If you like it, great. If not, you're probably not reading this anyway. For other details on the album, I'll let you read the other reviews.<br /><br />The real point of leaving this review is to let you know that this Amazon version [[ASIN:B009B51K9U ¡UNO! [+digital booklet]]] is a \\"clean\\" version. The curse words are there (PLENTY of them) but in this version they've all been covered up by a guitar riff or a sound effect. I don't know if this is the original released version of the album but I doubt it. If so, what's the point of even having those words in the lyrics? Just write them out. However, I can't find an \\"explicit\\" version on Amazon so perhaps this is the original.<br /><br />I have my own feelings about whether this is a good or bad thing but I'll leave it to your own preferences as all our needs are different. I just thought everyone should know that this is a \\"clean\\" version. Enjoy!<br /><br />****UPDATE****<br />OK folks, it's time for an update. Amazon has now added two new versions of the album that were not available when I wrote this review earlier today (9/25). There is now an Explicit version ([[ASIN:B009B50QOU ¡UNO! [Explicit]]]) and Explicit version that includes four videos ([[ASIN:B009CREQJS ¡UNO! [Explicit] [+video]]]). I only wish these had been available before I got sucked into the daily deal clean version.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I ordered the FiiO E17 Headphone Amp from EMusic Enterprise and it came right away...the amp is designed well.  Its the perfect accompaniment to enhancing your ipod and Audio Technica headphones, make sure you use L-shaped line out jacks.  EMusic Enterprise is an efficient reliable company, they are also very accomodating if you need a replacement or return.
B008OTTSX4|4.0|Well..I have always preferred \\"Fireball\\" and in \\"In Rock\\", not to mention even older, semi-progressive recordings by DP.  \\"Machine Head\\" was too 'primitive' and deprived of melody at that time (IMO). This CD now fills the gap perfectly. Each cover sounds different and is perfect (with exception of 'Smoke On The Water' by Flaming Lips). However we have a treat here, special gem: 'When a Blind Man Cries'. It is like a 'Child in Time' on \\"In Rock\\".
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I held out long after every friend told me to get this book, mainly because of all the hype the film received, but then, two days ago, I broke down. Fast paced, gripping, even emotional at times. Just read it, you'll be glad you did.

0670287059|5.0|I still have my copy from when I was a kid that I just started reading to my 2 year old.  She was hogging the book so I couldn't see the words.

This is one of my go to books for Birthday presents because I think every kid should have a copy in their library.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|while the game is simple enough for the youngest child to play, you can employ a little more strategy to make it more interesting. Unfortunately, you can't control where the puzzle or prizes drop but it will be interesting to see what happens when you get them all.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Does not contain the full I Want Your Sex. It contains Part II of that song; which is mostly instrumental. If you want the full length version get the Faith cd. Does not contain Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go or Everything She Wants and other Wham hits. It Does contain a nice Careless Whispers. Outside of these discrepancies it's an awesome collection of hits. Many number ones. The second cd is especially structured for dancing or a  pretended evening dining out in one of those trendy bistros that suddenly appear in gentrified old town areas of your city. Grilled cheese and MD20/20 never tasted so good.
B008RYN44U|4.0|It's hard to imagine that 11 years have gone by since No Doubt's last studio album \\"Rock Steady\\", probably because lead vocalist Gwen Stefani hasn't been out of the public eye much, releasing 2 solo albums.<br /><br />Those in love with the band's Ska sound will love the choppy  \\"Settle Down\\" (with a rather theatrical intro), the bouncy \\"Push And Shove\\" featuring Major Lazer (and interesting tempo shifts), and the slower groovy \\"Sparkle\\" (with some heavy bass).<br /><br />\\"Looking Hot\\" is Dance/Rock with a lovely horn-peppered Dubby break. \\"Gravity\\" is a sunny Pop/Rock number with a David Guetta-channeling piano riff. \\"Undercover\\" is a dreamy rocker that would do Blondie proud. \\"Heaven\\" is laden with clap/click effects.<br /><br />Slowing things down is the jangly Indie \\"One More Summer\\" with Stefani singing \\"I'm your lover, you're my weakness\\", a highlight and one that wouldn't sound out of place on her albums. The album is evenly balanced between upbeat songs and ballads. Continuing on the slow side of things are \\"Easy\\", the guitar-driven \\"Undone\\" (another highlight), And closing is the absolutely gorgeous \\"Dreaming The Same Dream\\".<br /><br />A fully satisfying album, let's hope Gwen and the gang don't wait another 11 years to turn out another winner like this.
0143121006|4.0|My review copy was provided courtesy of LuxuryReading.com, which also hosted the original (shorter) post of this book review on September 18, 2012.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Midnight in Peking is the story of the brutal murder of a young British ex-pat woman-girl (she was nineteen at the time of her death) living in Peking - a murder that was never officially solved.  As with all mysteries, there are layers to the story that are only teased out over time.  Those layers paint a picture of a complex, socially and culturally dichotomized world on the brink of change at the hands of Japanese invaders - and Communist Chinese.<br /><br />The book opens with Pamela's death and proceeds with the attempts by her father and a joint team of Peking and British authorities to determine whodunit and why.  The author, historian Paul French, appears to have left no stone unturned in his research.  He follows the winding trail of Pamela's last day to its horrifying conclusion, discovering along the way that her father, E.T.C. Werner, had done much of his work for him.  Unfortunately, this work was largely ignored by Chinese and British authorities - despite Werner's repeated efforts to bring it to their attention - and Werner would never see justice or resolution for his adoptive daughter's murder.<br /><br />The narrative flows smoothly.  The writing is crisp and the tale is well-told.  Pamela Werner was a more complicated girl than those around her knew; this complexity is teased out and presented via mini-revelations throughout the course of the story.  The characters around her - including those ultimately responsible for her death - are vividly painted, warts and all.<br /><br />This is an officially unsolved murder.  No one was ever charged or forced to pay the piper for Pamela's death.  There is a surprising amount of evidence that went unheeded, evidence that Paul French turns into a narrative describing the murder, and this is how he closes Pamela's story.  I have to admit that this was the weakest part of the book for me.  Not because the writing isn't good or the story isn't well presented, but because it felt a little out of place in a non-fiction work of documented history.  There is no direct set-up explaining that this is the author's interpretation of the evidence and the events.  Motives are ascribed, as are feelings - none of which can possibly be known for fact.  Granted, a number of things are presented as \\"perhaps\\" or in the alternative (maybe it was X person, maybe Y), so some of the story is presented as speculation.  But still, after the meticulous presentation of fact throughout most of the book, I found this a surprising way for the author to wrap things up.  Again, it wasn't bad - I don't fault his assumptions, didn't find glaring inconsistencies.  From the evidentiary set-up, everything probably did go at least largely as he described.  But it was an unexpected part of the book for me, nevertheless.<br /><br />I found French's book an interesting and insightful snapshot of a world I didn't know much about.  As with so much of life, the picture he painted was of an intricately interwoven web, layered with public and private personas and a lot of dark, well-kept, secrets.  It was a grim reminder that much of the surface elegance of the world is there to hide its seamy underbelly, that people are often not what they seem, and that all-too-often wicked deeds go unpunished.  But it was also a reminder that the truth will out, and that the perseverance of one man - be he father or researcher - can bring resolution, even if not justice.that this was the weakest part of the book for me.

So far the second book is just as amazing as the first book. Keep writing amazing books! Live, Love, Hunger Games!

The free version provides a nice selection of looped sounds for continous play and provides the capability to mix independent sounds to create your own, tailored, environment.

It would be nice to be able to play the sounds in background so that you could listen to your background environment while doing other things on your Kindle.

B008220DGE|4.0|This movie makes a big joke about trillions of years, as if anyone betting trillions of anything on the way he thinks should stand corrected. Now that Americans are bombarded with statistics that have already been rolling in the wrong direction to the tune of trillions of dollars, the idea that our energy comes from interactions long before the Earth had cosmic incipience during what has been merely the last ten billion uears, anyone who feels the need for a past that can be so nebulous is subject to ridicule. As a movie, The Master does not take a stand. It offers an invitation:<br /><br />Come back forever.<br /><br />I have been so concerned about differences between England and America that I am aware of books like Ralph Waldo Emerson's [[ASIN:1848855885 English Traits: A Portrait of 19th Century England]] and Michael Foot's [[ASIN:0060390913 The Politics of Paradise: A Vindication of Byron]]. People in America are likely to view anyone who offers a cure as worse than a fool unsupported by a scholarly team of equals all doing the same thing. For a leader of a cult, the only people likely to agree are the people who think they have come back forever to what they already lack from trillions of years ago. In the movie, the police in Philadelphia arrest Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) for practicing medicine without a license because he considers delving into the past trillions of years a possible cure for some types of leukemia. Government in America is very protective of professions. As a doctor, Harry Stack Sullivan even seconded the motion to keep Otto Rank from practicing psychoanalysis in the United States because Otto Rank had never been trained as a physician. Laura Dern as Mrs. Sullivan in Philadelphia provides a perfect contrast to American men when it comes to attitudes about who is qualified to say whatever egotistical sublime rumination has revealed about what is wrong.<br /><br />On a totally different cultural level, the character Freddie is treated like Cosima Wagner had an opportunity to lecture Friedrich Nietzsche about how every man who is not completely domesticated is rotten at the core. This may make culture seem like a disaster to those who have been raised on entertainment values, but it also tends to show how Americans were on the verge of retreating 800 years in 1950, when Freddie still has not gone home after serving in World War Two.reated like Cosima Wagner had an opportunity to lecture Friedrich Nietzsche about how every man who is not completely domesticated is rotten at the core.

B0092MKTL2|5.0|All the songs are great and gets me pumped. An album worth buying. Be sure to get \\"It's Time\\" if you can only afford one song.
B000P0J09C|4.0|Showed up a day late, not a big deal though. Im still very happy with it. UPS is a great company and provides good service also I this movie is awesome
B0058PJ6NE|4.0|Does not work on original kindle fire, does work on Kindle HD.  I would recommend reading through the rest of the reviews (along with this one) to confirm that this product is actually still working at all.
B0091XRL86|2.0|My wife, son and I all fell asleep while watching this movie. They tried too hard to make it funny.... It wasn't.
B008FPZQRO|5.0|Tarkus has always been one of my favorite ELP albums. The music on it is so good. So I got this 3 CD set to find out how it would sound in surround sound - It is STUNNING!! The added depth of surround sound increases the listening experience greatly. I won't spoil your pleasuer by describing all the different effects it creates other than at one point during Tarkus Carl's thundering drums are coming from everywhere - It is incredible! Also, the sound quality on this CD is excellent. I really think it helps the sound to have a powered woofer for Greg's bass and Carl's bass drums, seperating them from the other instruments sound. If you like ELP and have a surround sound system you owe it to yourself to get this set. I also bought the debut album deluxe edition but haven't had a chance to listen to it yet. It is a shame that more groups don't do this - There are so many albums that would sound amazing in surround sound.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like it.  energy should be faster cash should be cheaper. more expansion would be nice. perhaps add a calendar and seasons to change it up
B001HNE3NO|3.0|I debated whether to give this book three or four stars because I'm on the fence. On the one hand, it is a great story, and I do recommend it. I love fiction woven around true historical events: in this case, it's a very disturbing event, but one I'm glad I learned more about. It's very memorable for all that, and for a good plot... and that's why you should read it! But sometimes I felt the writing itself could have been sharpened up, edited a bit... not sure. My feelings started at the beginning of the book, when the main character - a young girl at the time - thinks that her mother looks older than her 30 years. It didn't ring true for me: I don't think a ten-year-old knows what 30 years old looks like, nor be able to discern whether she looked too tired or too old for that age. I know, such a nitpicky little detail, but it started me off on a false note. And, referring to the main character (at the beginning, anyway) as \\"the girl\\" was sort of an irritating devise. I wanted to connect with her faster, and keeping her nameless kept it all at a distance. Especially when you knew what her name would turn out to be: uh, the name on the cover? There was a bit much of that kind of predictability throughout.<br /><br />That said, the book kept me up reading until the wee hours; I couldn't put it down.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|What a book... WHAT A BOOK...<br />Nothing is left unsaid... the all plot makes sense... the characters are strong and very well characterized... absolutely no inconsistencies.<br />The story keeps you holding the book through ought the night, through out the day... absolutely brilliant. Can't wait for the second book.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is so freaking awesome!!! Even though I have a book report to do on it.:( I haven't read the book and I am excited to finally get to read it.
B004SIP7TE|5.0|Everything came in at perfect timing.  It was packaged properly to keep it safe. The movie was in great shape. I have nothing negative to say about this.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|It's a fun little game.  Online play is ok, when it's actually working.  Many issues with server stability when playing online.
1476712042|5.0|I have read and reread this book several times! I love these types of books that are more stuck to reality of how young men and women talk. With every step these two character's took, I was right along side them. The dynamic between Travis and Abby is drawn out, but in the best way possible. The pair are so prideful in the beginning and somewhat throughout the book, until they can no longer stand to be apart. But even when they are together, the obstacles are more to a realistic tone than the dramatic books I've read in the past. I STILL love this book and reread it often. I can't wait for the next book this wonderful author has written based on Travis' side of the story!!!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|At times I found the transitions a little hard to follow.  In general a good book, but not one I didn't want to stop reading for awhile.  I found the descriptions of the time period interesting and learned several new things about what it was like to live at that time.  It provides a great deal of insight into what motivated people living then.  It was about gaining power, which I knew already.  Some gained power through setting others up so they could be disposed of, either by living in the tower or death.  Others found by getting support and respect of the people working their land was far more valuable than using out and out force first.  In this way, they had a ready army at their disposal.  Interesting concept indeed.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I am not normally compelled to write a book review.  but this is a superb read.  Medieval fantasy.....easily comparable to Game of Thrones.  Lets hope HBO pick this one up!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Thought it would be boring.  Very addictive!  The first time I played for 2 hours.  Wish there was a way to get more. coins without paying or waiting so long....
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I found this thoroughly gripping and suspenseful without the gory details of some murder mysteries. His wry sense of humor added the right touch of cynicism to make this a novel I couldn't put down!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|very engaging and well thought out book<br />I enjoyed the characters and the premise<br /><br /> - where the H is book II -
B000W7JWUA|5.0|There are some quite sneaky strategies to this game if you can think ahead. Do you want to travel across the map or hoard the highest rolled locations or ports? I enjoy this game and you will too if you like playing Risk. This game is just a little bit different in that there arn't grudge matches like in Risk. It is still dependent on a favourable dice roll and locations that you take over first but it is more thought and strategy oriented with options of trade and bartering. Quite a good game with options for extra expansions.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read these the week before my husband and I married. All THREE books in less than a week. Got pregnant on our honeymoon!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" is by a dedicated patriot who loved the challenge of his chosen career. Through his writing one becomes involved in the minute details of what a special operations warrior must do to excel in this type of environment.<br />Napoleon referred to an axiom that \\"No one man is an army, an army is successful only as a team\\". Mark shows us that just being a member of a team is not enough, you must become a family and put all of your family before yourself.<br />In a time when our leaders are more concerned with lining their respective pockets and taking credit for good and spectacular events, while denying knowledge or complicity for bad or inequitable ones. We can thank our respective Gods for patriots that are willing to go in harms way, do without what most of us consider imperative to our well being, just for the free privilege to serve.<br />Yes Mister President, all this for a flag!
0425263908|1.0|Wow...I can't believe an author can get away with copying another author's work. There is nothing new. Another 28 year old billionaire? Really? The similarities to Fifty Shades are almost embarrassing. I wanted to like it, but its not original. She is riding on the coat tails of Fifty Shades.
B0031R5K68|5.0|I could not put this book down ! My Kindle went everywhere with me. I was stealing moments during my working day to read what happened next. Robert Langdon is a character that you get to know and love more with each installment. I sincerely hope that Dan Brown brings us another mysterious Langdon adventure. \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is an addictive and compelling read. Dan Brown is the master of creative description and just when you think you've \\"got it\\" ... you will be surprised with something new. If you loved Robert Langdon<br />and the characters from The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, then don't miss this one. Does our much loved Professor really die ???<br />Read on !
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app would recommend to everyone and love love love love the creativity and freeness new ideas and crafts
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|While reading Wonder I felt feelings of all kinds. Now I am reading Wonder to my fifth grade class and they are already expressing tremendous feelings for Auggie.I know he will be a great inspiration for many of my students.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I must say, I was skeptical about this one but when I started reading it I literally could not put it down! I've read it probably a hundred times over, reading my favorite parts over and over. It's truly a gem of a book and anyone that's looking for something different to the typical \\"girl meet's guy and they live happily ever after\\" is gonna love the twist and turns of Beautiful Disaster. I literally could not say enough good things about this book. It's definitely one of my FAVORITES.<br /><br />Get it.<br /><br />Love it.<br /><br />I did.
0891419063|5.0|This is an OUTSTANDING BOOK, true and real. A good read. Any combat vet will see themselves. You will enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|entertaining and fun. so many games to play! always wanting to beat more and more to get to the next games and to unlock them.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Pros:<br />- The profile editor is extremely easy to use.<br />- Lots of customizable buttons.<br />- Feels great.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- it doesn't cook for me.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br /> - Although I mainly use this for gaming, it can be used for other applications as well. That was the main reason I bought it, once I realized I could use it with Photoshop, which I use all the time for my job. The days of my hands cramping from copy-pasting all the time are over, it's all one button away! I mapped the analog stick to zoom in and zoom out and thought myself pretty clever. =)
B007S1RGUQ|5.0|I love the Fabulous Bonnie Raitt style!  Just a little bit blues, a little bit folksy, and a blend of rock make this a supurb CD.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|this app is pretty lame and boring. it would be great for a 3 year old or 90 year old maybe but not for an average person. I uninstalled after 5 minutes of being strangely addicted. DONT download and get addicted!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I enjoy this app. It's fun sharing with others.  I have learned so much. I have tried some of craft patterns, recipes and organization ideas that I have pinned. I just wish they wouldn't have so many connection (hiccup) problems.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The only reason I give this book four stars instead of five is because it jumps around a lot to the past, the present, then back to the past, and I got kind of lost. BUT...I loved the happy ending in the end :) Great book!!! And at the end of the book, James' writes parts of all three books from Christian's point of view. That was a pleasant surprise! WRITE ALL THE BOOKS FROM CHRISTIAN'S POINT OF VIEW JAMES! :)
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Should have taken the time to keep more details from the book.<br />Too easy to pick at missing details this close to book release.
B003I55BIA|3.0|Good story...pretty good...but I didn't fall in love with the idea of Alejandro and Brittany. I didn't like Alejandro at all, and the love story just wasn't that epic. However, if you are into the bad boy, good girl thing, it's a good read. Regardless, it is well written!
B004I744AS|3.0|Nice very easy to use, very helpfull don't have to carry a dictionary with me<br />Good for people who can't spell
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very unlikely story, but still very, very HOT. The choice of words is often repetitive, and the story is more than fictional, but the book sent butterflies to my stomach still :) Oh how I wish I could be Anastasia Steele! Finding a rich man with a dark past who is willing to change for you...who would do anything for your safety and is completely controlling...and who trusts you enough to touch him (eventually) after never letting anyone touch him that way since the age of four....if you were Ana, you would melt! Every girls dream is to find a Christian Grey :) Or at least someone similar...minus a could things I guess...LOL. Oh and did I mention the book is HOT????? ;)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it!! Could not put it down. I really enjoyed the whole set.  I would recommend them to my friends.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a terrific book and I can't see where the guy gave away any secrets. Where he is in trouble is his version differs from the official one. As a former government employee I would advise him to keep his head down.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|great product.  keeps pc cool once the bonding is completed. overclock  i5 ivy bridge  38 degrees going steady.  I have kept  my pc running guild wars 2 for 8 hours straight , no dedicated video card, my temp increase by 2 degrees.  this is some real type sh!!t.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of writing in this book. I expected a dry, amateuer writer's account of the events, but was shocked that it read like a fictional thriller!
B0087HT36U|4.0|Different angle than angry birds, but essentially the same. Interesting take and fun to play, but almost too easy. Twenty

B000TGJ80I|5.0|[[ASIN:B000TGJ80I Underworld (Unrated) [Blu-ray]]]This first installment of the series is still the most fully realized film of the bunch, although there are some nice sfx in the sequel as well.  The establishment of the world of Underworld is well executed, and it's always a joy to watch Bill Nighy do almost anything (don't miss his incredible turn in The Girl in the Cafe), and Kate Beckinsale is never better.  The series is due for another installment to wrap it up.
B0087HT36U|4.0|For. 99 cents well worth it. hours of fun and very addicting. would like to see new levels and weapons.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|A journey of aural ecstasy. No more need be said of the absolute genius that are Mumford & Sons. Except a thank you to the band for Babel.
1476712042|5.0|I am a 30 year old woman who grabbed this book and I read it in ONE SITTING! I could not put it down and I thought about the characters for days. I think real love is messy, wild, confusing, thrilling, and intense, exactly what the characters experience. Its also thrilling to see the gorgeous bad boy fall hard for us good girls :)
B006OCM0G0|3.0|it's good but the one for ipod is better. it needs to have notifications and challenges like the ipod has.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|A neat way to get your mind off everything for awhile and improve your concentration skills.It is also interesting to study the different characteristics of the chinese alphabet and how subtle some of the differences are.
B008D28HYS|4.0|This has become one of my favorite games. Plenty of thought required but you can take all the time you need to solve a puzzle.  No clock or opponent to beat, but still considerable difficulty,  even at the easy levels.  The correct answer is precise, so lots of strategizing and planning ahead to win a puzzle. Sometimes you have to simply guess and keep going; then go back and fix errors later.  There are lots of puzzles to solve and multiple difficulty levels. Great game for the price!  Hint: to get a puzzle started, find a row or column that needs to have to have the same # of squares filled as are in that row.  Ie : if there are 25 squares in the row, find a row where all 25 need filled with Colorado. You can work from there.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The. Best. Bible. App. countless devotions, and readings. And so many translations, and versions. This app can replace a bookshelf. Or a cluttered desk.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is the best thing ever. I'm on it all the time. when I log on, it kind of gives me a hard time so I have to get off the app. then I play the app again and its fine :)
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am very glad I haven't bought this box set, having seen them at a friend's I have to admit the production quality is much better than the very disappointing Special Edition DVDs but the change Lucas continues to make to a once beloved mythology, aside from destroying childhood memories also make the story telling worse. Please, please, please take Star Wars away from that meddling pillock.
B008JAFXOQ|1.0|Boring and not worth renting.  It did not peak my interest.  Kept waiting for the movie to get better. Poor acting, lacked excitement, story line wasn't anything terrific.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app tells me exactly how much battery I have left and how much hours I can use up and in just as quick as one click.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I'm really glad this is a free app. or I might have never tried it. it is extremely helpful in letting me know if I need to charge. I'm terrible at checking myself but this comes on automatically when I turn on my device.  it has other helpful info as well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There has always been dystopic science fiction but this is possibly the best and most distrubing because it is so tragically plausable. This really is a must read. Without giving anything away there is nothing in these stories that I could not see happening in the near term.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The information contained in this book was interesting but far too technical for the average reader.<br />I felt it could have been simplified to make an easier read with a strong case still being argued.<br />I finished the book as I was interested in the topic & will now look for further ones on this subject.<br />Please note I am not the author's wife!
0307887448|5.0|To say this is a great book is an understatement. I have recommended to all my friend and every one of them have loved it.<br /><br />Do you like classic video games? Do you like classic 80s movies and television shows? Did you grow up watching cheesy Japanese monster movies?<br /><br />Why are you reading this review? Get. This. Book. Better yet, get the audiobook. It is read by Wil Freaking Wheaton and he does a fantastic job. (btw, I think Wil Wheaton should play the main bad guy in the movie adaptation).<br /><br />I haven't had so much fun reading a book since the first Harry Potter novel. It's that good.<br /><br />As with Harry Potter, it is fun to imagine we live in the world the author has envisioned. In this case it is a virtual world called the oasis. That is one of the wonderfully compelling things about this novel. Everything in it feels possible. Virtual Retinal displays are real and I can imagine a future where everyone lives in this virtual utopia. And the way the company makes money by charging for traveling in the oasis is genius.<br /><br />Everything is done right. Solid pacing, humorous dialog, great ending.<br /><br />Thanks Ernest for creating such a fun read.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The movie was wonderful.  I think it captured the importance of nature and how we should protect it. The characters and the color really brought the book to life and depicted the importance of difference and acceptance.
0765316994|5.0|If there is such a thing as slap-stick sci-fi, then John Scalzi's \\"Red Shirts\\" is in the top 10 of that best list. I will tell you no more, other than to say it's in the Star Trek sense of the word. I've read some pretty laugh-out-loud sci-fi before now--<br /><br />the great Harry Harrison [born Henry Maxwell Dempsey (Mar. 12, 1925 - Aug. 15, 2012)] had his Stainless Steel Rat character.<br /><br />Ben Bova has an omnibus entitled \\"Laugh Lines\\", containing two of his funniest novels and several smaller works.<br /><br />Piers Anthony's early works start out with titles that are all plays on words, and get weirder as they go along : \\"Centaur Aisle\\", \\"Cube Route\\" (from his Xanth series) and \\"Myth Alliances\\", \\"Something M.Y.T.H. Inc.\\" (from his Myth series) to name just four. The contents of the books have been very `mixed'-ly reviewed--he's an acquired taste that some don't acquire.<br /><br />And Isaac Asimov, while no `hoot', did very well at the sneak-up-on-you type humor--and occasional pun. (Which I have never much minded--I guess it takes pun to know pun.)<br /><br />But I suppose top honors must be given to the Master, Kurt Vonnegut--he made us laugh by turning our brains inside out--and that's something you don't see a lot of on Comedy Central--and only rarely on HBO's comedy specials. And since no one reads anymore, I guess you just plain don't find it anywhere anymore.<br /><br />And Vonnegut is not immune to the ravages of time--just like stand-up comics, once you've read Vonnegut you only chuckle the second time around, thinking of how different everything was in the 1970s and how a voice like Vonnegut's, a still, small voice of reason in the madness that is civilization, has been supplanted by our numbness to all the changes, and the acceleration of the changes, and the 300 TV channels, and the 24-hour news, and the global online community. We no longer need Vonnegut to write about the chaotic nature of the universe--it slaps us in the face every g. d. morning.<br /><br />So, welcome to the monkey house, as Kurt would say, and enjoy Scalzi's surreal space opera, \\"Red Shirts\\"--a take on a catchphrase from a fad from a convention from an old 1960s TV series--all while the characters hurtle through a deadly universe that seems to pick and choose its victims.<br /><br />A word to the serious--if you don't like 'silly', this may not be your favorite book. I've always been a big fan.orning.<br /><br />So, welcome to the monkey house, as Kurt would say, and enjoy Scalzi's surreal space opera, \\"Red Shirts\\"--a take on a catchphrase from a fad from a convention from an old 1960s TV series--all while the characters hurtle through a deadly universe that seems to pick and choose its victims.<br /><br />A word to the serious--if you don't like 'silly', this may not be your favorite book.

B000FC1MM8|5.0|Full of suspense and intrigue. I like the way the storyline reverts back to the main characters youth and how he attributes that to how he currently observes life.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I am the rare female who really loves some serious guitar.  Joe Bonamassa is superb in his talent for playing and his vocals.  I have played this cd so much in a such a short time that I am surprised it is not worn out. I live in NOVA and work in DC - traffic can be brutal - Joe saves me and I actually enjoy my commute just so I can listen to him in my car without interruption. Just outstanding music.  I also purchased \\"Dustbowl\\" at the same time and love it equally.  I highly recommend any of his music to people who really love Stevie Ray Vaughan-bluesy-rock music...dare I say...even better!!  No haters please.  \\"-)

B003O86FMW|5.0|I was never a \\"Hunger Games\\" fan. I bought Blue-ray for GF. I found myself over-taken and began telling people about it. While at work people kept talking about the books. Once I read the first book I was hooked. The second book keeps the pace the and keeps you intriqued. I think it was well written and hand some nice curve balls.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|A quick read. A believably accurate account of what went down. Nice to hear it from a professional that was there & not some talking head with political motivations.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is a thought provoking and easy read.  I really enjoyed it. It makes one stop and consider what is important in our lives and how sometimes, if we aren't careful,  life passes by without much notice.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|wanted something to do so I got it. it is entertaining but wish you got more coins more quickly I like these kind of mindless games
B008XG1X18|4.0|Takes a bit to load sometimes but I love being able to pin while on my kindle fire! Nice app, and seems to work just as well as on my laptop.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I have been waiting for months for this album after hearing a song from Sigh No More and falling in love with this band.  Their sound is distinct and beautiful.  This new album I got today is just as good as the first.  I can't say one is better than the other.  This album is a continuation of the sound of their first album and incredibly well done.  I will be listening to this one over and over just like their first and waiting for more music.  Totally worth the wait!

B008M34CSI|1.0|This is a terrible movie about a space prison. Guy Pierce is annoying in it, and the other actors just don't pull anything off. However, it's hard to blame them because the directing is downright juvenile. I expect better from a Luc Besson production, but given the past few movies he's been apart of, I don't know why.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Yes, I prefer an hour with a book to an hour with  most people that I have to spend an hour with. And GOOD for me !!! Thank you for telling it like it is !!!
B0013TTLDE|3.0|I enjoyed this book, and will certainly check out more books by Kate Morton.  She did a fantastic job painting the time period.  I would recommend this to my friends who enjoy the Downtown Abbey series, and similar period pieces.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|Whoever thought this set was a good idea should be put out to pasture.<br /><br />I was really, really, really looking forward to seeing these shows in HD in November.<br /><br />Now I am canceling my preorder.<br /><br />I have no interest whatsoever in seeing these abridged episodes in any form.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book was recommended by a friend. I can only say the first 4 chapters were painfully slow to read in that the author lays a clear and tangible foundation to set up what is to follow. So plodded through the first 4 chapters and whoa did the pace pick up! What intrigue, clever politics, well placed humour and satire (mainly the main character). The characters are strong, well thought out and amidst such angst and treasonous suffering they come out stronger; the start of revolution and uprising. A must read in that it is a view into a world i had never before imagined and left me hopeful of the human condition (as it is something that forever interests me). The end merely feeds ones anticipation for what is to come and you then have to, have to read Catching Fire and of course the Mockingjay! READ THIS because i could not put these books down!
B004NOH9LC|1.0|What a waste of good talent. The director should be sued. I mean, how can you make a bad movie with greats like Harrison Ford,  Diane Keaton, and Jeff Goldblum? And yet it happened. The plot was stupid, the actors were like they were sleepwalking, and Rachel McAdams, who at least was cute in The Notebook, came off like an idiot bimbo. What an embarrassment of a movie, so bad it was irritating. I wish I could give it negative stars - it would at least make me feel better after watching such drivel.

B008NEVP1S|5.0|I have been a fan of Aimee's work since the Magnolia Soundtrack and Bachelor No. 2 (the latter of which I owned about four copies). Since then, I've followed her recording career with much anticipation for each and every installment she has made in rock music history. With the exception of just a few tracks from Lost in Space (2002), my opinion of her music has remained extremely high. It just got higher.<br /><br />Since I received my copy of Charmer in the mail, it hasn't left my side. Well, that's a lie. I carry a burned copy around in my pocket so as not to damage my purchased copy. Next I'm buying the vinyl edition available on her website. Hell, I may even buy a shirt.<br /><br />Charmer is Aimee Mann's best work to date. I'd name off my favorite tracks one by one, but the entire track listing is already posted above. There's not a bad apple in the bunch. Whether considered in it's entirety or simply, track for track, the experience is beautiful. Every song is completely justified both musically and lyrically so the album doesn't sag in places - at all. The production, is enough to leave any audiophile writing in ecstasy. Vocally, Mann is an artist at her height of her career. Her delivery is dead-on. It's obvious that she's raised the bar even higher for this album with respect to her impressive use of sarcasm and sad humor to write believable lyrics themed around topics you don't usually hear used in songs - and with sincerity.  So sincere in fact, it's difficult to not listen. I find myself trying to get things done through my day while I replay this album and I end up accomplishing nothing. I'm continually lured back to the stereo and the printed lyrics and it doesn't take long before I've completely forgotten what I was doing. I guess that's the point. If \\"charm\\" - as Mann explains - is sometimes used as a form of manipulation, I'm fine with it. As long as it sounds like this.

B008OOYALE|4.0|now this game rocks and all but ever since I found out about dragon story new dawn, that's right I said New Dawn the update or game or whatever and was wondering. WHEN IS IT GOING TO GET TO KINDLE FIRE!!!!! I REALLY WANT THAT GAME!!!! but still. fun game.
B000FC10MU|5.0|I read American Gods in paperback a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I have now bought the kindle edition and read it again. It is the mark of a great story that you can read and re-read with satisfaction each time. Neil Gaiman's prose is deft and his story imaginative and the pace with which he moves his story will keep you glued to this book. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone, not only fans of the genre.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Writer gave a good picture of how HE viewed his role within this mission and other missions he and his team have taken. Book was well written and keeps your interest from start to finish.Writer used terms I heard before by watching \\"Surviving The Cut \\" on the Military Channel. A good read
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app does what it says it will do. I read other reviews that say it made their kindle fire \\"hot as a coal\\" but I haven't had that problem on mine. It does open itself when you plug your device in to charge but if you hit the back arrow at the bottom it takes you right back to what you were doing before, I'm usually playing a game and when I go back it is paused so that's ok. I like that it tells you how much time you have to charge play games read etc and it is nice looking. I haven't accidentally opened the adds so they are in a good spot and there are no weird permissions so thumbs up :).
B005SZARKK|5.0|My friend suggested this show to me. It was AMAZING! I  was like, \\" okay let me see with this fuss is about\\" I could not stop watching it. You will love the twists and turns. You will love the ways these people try to tear each other down, but it's entertainment so it's great! You will love the plots. There are several . The writing for this show is slick, and quick and you just can't look away. As soon as you think you have it all figured out, BAM -something else happens! It's wonderful.I am all set for the season 2 premiere on Sunday night!
B008XG1X18|4.0|it a great app. but sometimes in the middle of looking at stuff it locks up. other than that I love it
B008MEM24S|5.0|My scores definitey improved after each time. The only bad thing is there aren't anymore levels! And of course I love Perry!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I am riveted, obsessed rather, by this world and as the more I take the time to educate myself via reading, watching movies, documentaries, asking questions from those that I know are in the military, my admiration and respect for those that make these sacrifices continues to manifest. Single, regular chick by all standards compared to the commandos in this book and as I am about 20% in, although the book is written to inspire young potential SEAL's, I felt inspired to do my part so I researched navy seal charities and will be committing to One Team One Fight to raise funds for the families of the fallen Navy SEAL's. 50% in, still inspired and even my family are making fun of me because I tell them I have to read my SEAL book instead of having dinner with them. And then we hit the 65% mark and I read the lines sitting in bed sipping a Corona Light that casually stated \\"while the rest of America was painting Easter eggs, I was preparing for the biggest mission of my life/career...\\". I'm 31, I pay my taxes, contribute to the American society, sit in a cube Mon-Friday trying making a living, and I don't paint Easter eggs. The \\"rest of America\\" didn't know about the raid because I though we weren't supposed to know, in fact I thought SEAL's weren't supposed to exist. So, good read, mad respect and 5 stars to all the Americans that gathered the intel and did the work for the most critical mission in U.S history but the authors lost me at Easter eggs.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This Android electronic dictionary is easy to use, and especially useful if you are just checking to see how a word is pronounced the American way
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded this because I was bored. but it turned out to be very helpful! now I know how much longer I can play games or read or surf the web. it even measures the temp.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Great book - loved the path it took and showed conclusions to each person and the why behind it. Jack Reacher is a nonosense person and who could fault that . He has charisma and makes you feel totally safe .... bring on the entire series !
B005LAJ16I|4.0|\\"Homeland\\" Season 1 on Showtime is a riveting and highly credible portrayal of how the CIA, FBI and homeland security attempt to keep Americans safe from inside and outside terrorist threats. The Emmy winning script, acting and direction are all well deserved honors. The characters are complex and both Claire Danes and Damien Lewis do them justice in their portrayals. Sometimes the action can become a bit repeative, but overall the majority of the episodes are suspensful and also informative. I highly recommend buying or renting Season 1 on DVD and can't wait to watch Season 2 when it returns on Showtime.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Absolutely amazing and that is with everyone telling me it was good which usually builds something up too much for me but not the case with this...Julia's performance was outstanding!!  Loved it!!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|when i had an ipod i got this and trust me its awesome cant wait to play so this game is defenitley worth 1.00$

0812550706|4.0|This was the first SciFi book I've read.  I ordered it because it was on the Required Reading list for high schoolers and I was curious.  I found it very interesting; it's full of action and was a very easy read.  It would also make a good discussion book for a book club.

B006ZZANDI|5.0|Was confused when recieved the product as it looked more like a DVD than a CD but it did come with a nice book and was definatley a CD. Be forewarned, the book has Harry's birthday wrong which my daughter picked up within seconds. She was still happy with product for 18th b-day. Recieved order promptly and in perfect condition.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Did not like this book. Don't like the fact that each chapter was the opposite persons point of view...was never a story of both together. Then the ending was stupid. Actually, made me angry that I wasted my time reading it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book is much better than the first and actually has a story, but the sex scenes are redundant .  The same thing Over and over, she needs to buy a good thesaurus.... Maybe on amazon.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Entertaining, all around fun. Lots of action and good plot development. I enjoyed the special effects and appreciated the great sound quality and imagery in HD.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Love this game, hate Angry Bird. Many comparisons between the two so wanted to get that straight. Fake reviews? I think not. If you don't like the game, so be it but don't accuse those who do of being fake. This game is addictive and my only complaint is I need the next level! Please hurry it then the next and the next......
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Free game available.  It's fun for kids and adult.  Not a hard game, easy to play and some ate also challenging as well.
0061969664|5.0|I stumbled across Bernard Cornwell's first book in the Saxon Chronicles about four years ago, and have devoured each of them since.  Cornwell's first-person narratives are gripping, realistic, and immersive in a way I find to be rare in historical fiction.  Though epic battles are described in engaging detail (my heart races anytime the phrase \\"shield wall\\" appears), these books are very much character-driven, with a great deal of development of each.  In Death of Kings, we find the story moved forward by a very spoiler-ific milestone in British history, and though other reviewers have suggested the plot seems a bit tired by now, I found this to be one of the best in the series.  I strongly recommend these on audiobook, as the narrator--Stephen Perring--is once again absolutely phenomenal.<br /><br />The Saxon Chronciles has \\"HBO Original Series\\" written all over it; here's hoping it receives the well-deserved treatment one day.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|What a great read! I'm a 46 yr old working mother with absolutely no interest in military-related books. Until now. Seal Team 6 has to be the most interesting group of superheros in the world. I found this book to be well written and gripping from the first sentence of the first page. I could not put it down. I actually felt my stomach tense up and my nerves on edge during the mission for \\"UBL\\".  Cant wait for the movie.<br /><br />Revenge was never so sweet as it was told in No Easy Day. Its One Easy Read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was kinda disappointed with the ending and her reuniting with Peeta. Felt as if it dragged in a bit in the beginning. But was still a good book.

This was my first time reading Gillian Flynn and it certainly won't be my last!<br /><br />Fast paced, scary deep characters, intriguing plot lines which shift back and forth between characters.<br /><br />Great choice for a Book Club discussion for sure!<br /><br />I gave it a great number of stars for the detail and creativity of the plot...It kept me going till the last page!
0525952926|4.0|In Fall of Giants, Follett portrays the Great War in a huge and engrossing novel.  I found his depiction of WWII in the second Century Trilogy book even more captivating.  Here, the next generation is trying to learn something from their parents' experience during an international war to survive the rise of fascism. It's been two years since the first installment, and though the characters certainly weren't fresh in my mind, there was a familiarity when I reencountered them.  Their children take center stage, and through their associations, it demonstrates how small the world really is.  From Russia, to Germany and England, to America, these families offer unique perspectives to the conflict over the course of nearly two decades.<br /><br />There is so much just leading up to the outbreak of war that sets the stage for the horrors to come.  The rise of Hitler (obviously), the Spanish Civil War (did you know how bad the Communists botched that dispute?), and fascist aggression in London (I hadn't realized it was as much of a concern as Nazi invasion) are all factors in the grand scheme.  Then the entire calamity is rendered wonderfully, from the European theater, to the Pacific, nuclear development, and espionage. There are some brilliant anecdotes, like when a Russian couple browses the Sears Roebuck catalogue in awe and wonder.  Admittedly, the writing is not exceptional, and the in-depth political discourses can be dry, but for 900+ pages, it's a quick read (got it done in less than a week).  A must for historical fiction lovers and Follett fans; I might consider him the Uris or Michener of our generation.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time.  I found myself looking up subjects this book brings up to learn even more.  It's fascinating, and I'll hold even more skepticism when people proclaim they're self-made.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good time killer. I love to get the prizes! I would recommend this to all ages. There is a strategy surprisingly to such a mindless game. creators should work on not having all true toys go strait to the edge.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I am a hugh Jack Reacher fan and have even been lucky enough to meet the writer here in New Zealand. My husband and I have both read this latest book and feel it is a bit slower than others we have read. Still a good read though

B008C1O8CA|5.0|After the two musical sagas that were American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown I was hoping Green Day would calm things down a bit and just produce some simple music again that would be easy to digest and enjoy. Don't get me wrong, I loved both 21st Century Breakdown and American Idiot, but they were LONG and INTENSE. I give Green Day huge accolades for making political music in a time when making political music is largely unpopular, and doing it very well. My long term gripe is that I couldn't casually listen to those records on repeat for hours like my old Green Day records from the 90's and I really missed that.<br /><br />Green Day responded exactly how I hoped they would with &iexcl;UNO!. Instrumentally it fits somewhere between Warning and Nimrod. It feels like a missing piece of a puzzle. Part of me wonders if some, if not a majority of these tracks, are from the canceled/lost \\"Cigarettes and Valentines\\" album because while they were recording that album Billie Joe stated that it would be more a more simple pop-rock album.<br /><br />Much to my delight, on &iexcl;UNO! I hear A LOT of influence from Cheap Trick, The Kinks, and The Clash. The guitar riff on Angel Blue is so much of a \\"The Clash\\" riff that I seriously had flashbacks to when I first bought London Calling in the late 90's. Some songs also remind me of Green Day's 60`s rock Foxboro Hot Tubs side project. A couple simpler tracks (\\"Loss Of Control, for example\\") have a definite garage-rock style that even remind me of Billie Joe's side project Pinhead Gunpowder's release, \\"Goodbye Ellston Avenue\\". As a long term Green Day fan and overall music glutton I can't tell you how AWESOME this is!<br /><br />I've been listening to Green Day since I was 13 and found my brother's CD of Insomniac in his CD player. I'm 28 now and a bigger fan than ever. They never fail to make a great record and this is no exception. Billie Joe continues to grow as a pop song writer and vocalist. Green Day described this as the \\"party album\\" of the trilogy. I am not 100% sure what that means since I can't compare it to the other two upcoming releases, but I'm interested to see where this trilogy goes. I am \\"hooked\\" again, thank you Green Day for making an old fan happy once again.bum\\" of the trilogy. I am not 100% sure what that means since I can't compare it to the other two upcoming releases, but I'm interested to see where this trilogy goes.

B00932A2MC|5.0|This is a great alien invasion movie with good acting and awesome special effects. Story line of sending a message into space and getting a bad answer is all too probable. The aliens are so nasty (and ugly) that you really want them to be defeated.
B0002ADWIA|1.0|It was not clear that this disk is in european format and will not play on US DVD players. After unsucessfully trying to view the disk on both DVD and Blue Ray players I managed to find on Amazon verification that this is indeed a DVD that will not play on US formated machines.

B0007CYW5A|1.0|This battery is a knockoff... though a pretty convincing one at first glance.  It operated fine, but only lasts about 1/5 of the life the real Sony batteries last.  After the battery ran out, I started noticing the tells that it was a knockoff.  Different color plastic, subpar screen printing of the text on the front of the battery, completely inaccurate Sony logo on the back...<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!

B007L3BMGA|4.0|Wow!  I flew through this book in just two days.  It is definitely a page turner and a great read, however; the sex scenes, as exciting and new, and totally out there, as they were, by the end of the book it was like, skip to the end already.  Thankfully, books 2 and 3 start cutting those scenes out a bit and you do get to skip to the end.  A great book, but I'm a little concerned that the movie that's coming out, just won't be able to do this book justice.  God knows that people, particularly the elderly, might have a major problem with the bondage and if that isn't part of the movie, then I'm afraid the movie just won't really be worth seeing.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Before release, several snippets were put out which garnered complaints about the quality of this re-worked 25 year old VHS tape.  Let me tell you nothing could be further from the truth!  While some background scenes may be lacking, the focus is all on Michael Jackson, and what else could be sweeter; down to the scuffing on his shoes and the sweat on his gorgeous dancer's body!  Unbelievable closeups!  Little to no audience interference although there was a shot at the beginning of several fainters being removed from the audience!  Michael's performance was otherworldly and it was inspiring to see him so happy the way the audience reacted to him.  Now as for the CD's, the bonus material (unreleased and demos) is excellent (would be considered completed versions by any other artist), favorites were Blue, Free, Price of Fame and Al Capone; certain others I've heard from BAD Special Edition released in 2001; did not care particularly for the remixes, particularly offensive was Pitbull or whatever his name is; why he was added defies logic.  The quality of the CD's is remarkable.  The booklets of information very well done, a poster of Michael (extra blessing!) all in a well-made case.  Who could ask for more?  Been waiting forever for the release of this tour.  Let's hope for release of Dangerous25 (although it's been out on DVD for years courtesy of HBO) and History25, and whatever else the Estate puts out that's ALL MICHAEL JACKSON, give me the demos of Michael any day rather than any overproduced \\"guess\\" as to what Michael \\"would have wanted\\".  Thank you Estate for this precious gift of Michael!

030758836X|3.0|Love and hate type of book; well written, but strange overall; reviews and sales had been so good, I was anxious to get my hands on the book;  thinking it would be a 2-3 day read, it turnd out as a 2 week read;  missed pulling me into the characters or the overall plot. HATED THE Ending.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is a good read for an overview of Seal work and taking down Bin Laden. Not as much detail on Seal training and specific techniques or operations but that is to be expected under the circumstances. Also a good description of all the supporting units that work with Seal teams.. It is worth purchasing and reading. Thanks to all those who currently serve and have served our country in the armed forces.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Found the subject material extremely interesting, but the writer was too disjointed in the book.  On several occasions the writer skipped over details (the were covered later in the book) that would have clarified the understanding of the events.  It is obvious to me that writer/publisher rushed book out for some reason.  Like I said, interesting material, just realize you won't understand all that is going on until later....
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game for adults & kids to pass the day away .Not a hard game for kids to pick up on .if you kid is into all types of video games.
0307887448|4.0|After numerous requests from people that I venture out of my comfort zone of romance, I decided to give this book a try.  It was sent to me for review -- one I didn't request -- but I thought I would use it as my stepping stone into a different type of read than what I am accustomed to.<br /><br />Can I just say that this book was completely the opposite of what I was expecting!  I am not a huge fan of Science Fiction, but I will say that this book gave a new take to the genre.  It was set in the new future which added the Dystopia theme to it.  It had undertones of Hunger Games like fighting in it.  It had suspense in it as well.  It was like a gift of several genres all wrapped nicely with a bow on it.  I couldn't believe I actually enjoyed a book like this.  The writing was even done to a point to where I felt like I was experiencing it like the main character at times.<br /><br />There were a few things that I didn't like about the book though. If you are not into the whole 1980's, then you might want to reconsider.  This book is rich in the eighties culture and has you step back into those horrible years of youth.  Even with that being said, I still say give it a try if you are willing to step into a different comfort zone for your next read.  You might find yourself finding a new story to enjoy.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is so engrossing. i find myself trying to re-do some levels over and over tor better time or to tri-gnome the level. it isn't always as easy as it looks at first. i hope they add more levels soon! agent p is the best!
B008RYN44U|3.0|My impression after listening to this album for about a week now is that this album is not just a follow-up to No Doubt's last album, released over a decade ago, but actually sounds more like a follow-up to Gwen Stefani's solo projects.  For instance, \\"Easy,\\" sounds like \\"Cool\\" or \\"Early Winter\\" from Gwen's own records.<br /><br />I just got it and haven't had a chance to let it all sink in but impressed and enjoying it all.  I personally loved the first single, Settle Down and am currently OBSESSED with their title track, Push and Shove.  Working with Diplo made sense as both No Doubt and Diplo draw inspiration from Reggae sounds.  One More Summer and Look Hot are also excellent Nu-wave style tracks also reminiscent of up-tempo dance tracks like \\"Real Thing\\" from Gwen's first solo record.<br /><br />Will come back and add to this review as I let it all sink in but for no very happy to have No Doubt back and get to hear Gwen Stefani's awesome vocals.
0345803485|1.0|I must agree with Ebeth822(?), so she did all the writing for me. Numerous I thought of quitting before finishing the book, but hoped if I read long enough I would find some redeeming value or some reason why the book was getting so much attention. The answer to both questions was no.<br /><br />How is it that publishers turn up their nose and refuse to publish so many truly good books and then turn around and publish such a poorly written, redundant, repetitive piece of trash?<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I had to stop every few pages and be sure the author was not 12 years old. I'm at a complete loss as to how and why this \\"book\\" got published, and strongly recommend to anyone considering reading it to not waste their time.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|A fictional account of real life under communism in East Germany. I studied pre-1989 Eastern Europe in depth and visited that particular country a number of times. This is really what was going on!<br /><br />The film is a great mix of fiction (for the love story part) and reality (for the political part). As such, it is a brilliant piece of work that entertains and educates at the same time.<br /><br />Just a few weeks after this film came out, Markus Wolf, the long time chief of Stasi, died in his sleep, a free man. It was 9 November, quite appropriately the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall, and the national day of the unified Germany he tried to prevent from ever coming into existance.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Purchased this game for my daughter, who's a Phineas and Ferb fanatic, but lo, I'm hooked!  I find myself going back and replaying levels she's already cleared, just for the heck of it.  (Does that make me a bad Dad?)  We downloaded lots of crap (excuse the expression) from the app store, but this is, by far, the best .99 I've ever spent.  I'll just add that I'm usually v-e-r-y leery of the Disney marketing machine, but they really got this one right!
B0099G7KDQ|3.0|I can't say I'm surprised at this album. M&S continues to do exactly what they did on the first album......EXACTLY.  You get the same variations on three tracks on this album as the last (albeit a solid three songs). You get your driving, powerful banjo/guitar/vocal combination (Babel = Little Lion Man), you get your slow uninteresting love ballad via piano that progresses into a driving banjo/guitar/vocal combination by the end of the song (Below my feet = Awake my soul), and one that progresses a bit quicker (Whispers in the Dark = The Cave). It really just depends how far you fast forward into the song, but you find the same (or a slight variation there of) banjo + guitar + vocal rif. I'm not saying it's not listenable, or even that it's not good music, it just gets old to me personally after about the first four tracks. It worked for them on the first album, so hey, why not do it again? Maybe the majority of people will notice it by their third album.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|While Mockingjay is an exciting book in the Hunger Games series, it is a rushed wrap up. Suzanne Collins starts off slow and really tries to develop and explain what has been occurring in the underground revolution; though I didn't agree with all of her creaative choices, it is clear. She then proceeds to illustrate an attack on the capital in the suspense filled writing of the first book. I found myself hanging on edge and visualizing exactly what was occurring. The ending of the book is what was disappointing to me. Although Collins makes choices in wrapping up the revolution and the love triangle that will please the reader, these portions of the story are completely underdeveloped. It is as if it was decided the book was getting too long. After having been on this intense journey for three novels, I would have preferred to see the more care and detail included in the conclusion.

B0069JBKHI|1.0|We had high hopes for this product.  We purchased it before baby came and it seemed to work fine at the beginning, but gradually started having issues connecting.  Baby is now 3 months old and just when we switched baby to sleep in his own room, no joke, monitor just stopped working!  The baby's room is not very close to our bedroom so there was no way we were going to have him sleep in his room without a monitor.  I ended up running out to Walmart and purchasing a Summer Infant and am very pleased with it.  It's so much easier to use.  It was a breath of fresh air to have a monitor that didn't involve technology (iphones, ipad, etc.).  I would wait till the next generation of those monitors to come out before trying something like this again.

B008XX6J92|5.0|Barbra Streisand is one of those rare singers who actually owns all the master tapes of every single recording she has made in her 60-plus year career. To coincide with her latest North American tour Barbra has released this album in rare vinyl form with the CD edition to come out on October 9th, 2012. The tracks are all previously unreleased songs Barbra and Columbia Records have never before made available to the public. Over the last year Barbra herself went through dozens of songs in her private vaults to determine which ones she liked best and which would fit so perfectly on this aptly named album called \\"Release Me\\".<br /><br /> Many singers over the years have recorded extra songs for albums they have put out, only to find the record company has decided to not include various tracks on a certain release for different reasons. So, intelligently Barbra has decided to include 11 tracks that were dropped from some of her album recordings to give them a \\"home\\" of their own.<br /><br /> \\"Release Me\\" includes 11 amazing and beautiful songs, tracks Barbra says, \\"The thing I am most happiest about is that I still have a great affection for these songs. They appealed to me at the time...and still do. Listening now, I actually think to myself, 'The girl wasn't half bad'\\".<br /><br /> The songs here include the gems \\"Didn't We\\" written by Jimmy Web and originally was part of an album project entitled \\"The Singer\\" from 1970; \\"Willow Weep For Me\\", a song dropped from Barbra's powerhouse album \\"Simply Streisand\\" from 1967; \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\" with Randy Newman on piano that was part of the \\"Stoney End\\" recording sessions from 1971; a studio version of \\"With One More Look At You\\" from \\"A Star Is Born\\" soundtrack, and two rare recordings from Barbra's acclaimed 1985 record \\"The Broadway Album\\" called \\"Home\\" from \\"The Wiz\\" and \\"How Are Things In Glocca Morra?\\"/Heather on the Hill\\" from \\"Finian's Rainbow/Brigadoom.<br /><br /> This marks the first time a Streisand album has been put on vinyl form since 2009's \\"Love is The Answer\\".<br /><br /> The 11 track listing for \\"Release Me\\" is as follows\\"<br /><br />1. Being Good Isn't Good Enough (from Helleleujah, Baby!)<br />2. \\"\\"Didn't We?\\"<br />3. \\"Willow Weep For Me\\"<br />4. \\"Try To Win A Friend\\"<br />5. \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\"<br />6. \\"With One More look At You (from \\"A Star Is Born\\")<br />7. \\"Lost In Wonderland\\"<br />8. \\"How Are Things In Glocca Morra?/Heather On The Hill(from Finian's Rainbow/Brigadoom)<br />9. \\"Mother and Child\\"<br />10. \\"If It's Meant To Be\\"<br />11. \\"Home\\" (from \\"The Wiz\\")<br /><br /> \\"Release Me\\" sold 40,000 copies during its first week of coming in at #7 on the Billboard Album's Chart.

B000PAAH3K|2.0|I did not like this book because to me it felt like the author is providing unnecessary details to fill pages of a book.<br />The underlying theory is well understood, but the narrative is too verbose.

B006H5120E|4.0|More of an insight into the titanic incident. Ive read the 'sinking of the titanic' (1912) true account by M. Geelan. There is no jack/rose on the real titanic ship of course or nude paintings being drawn. All this is just done to add spice to the titanic movie by the movie director. Another discrepancy from the real account i read compared to the movie was that according to Geelan, when the titanic was standing upright in a 180 degree vertical position just before sinking, all its lights were on and shining bright. Geelan described it as a sight so marvellous yet so frightening. However, in the movie, it is shown that the electric circuits stop working some while back and when the titanic is vertical all its lights are gone. Another discrepancy, in the account there is no mention of an officer shooting himself, but the movie shows so. And the rescue ship that arrives at dawn is named 'carpathian' with a 'n' at the end in the account by Geelan.<br /><br />---------<br />I know this review may not be helpful to you, but it wasnt meant to be. If you feel the urge the press the 'No' button, please help yourself.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I am a little over 2/3 through this book, and I find myself thinking about it throughout the day and I can't wait to get back to it. It is a large book but it does not feel long and never gets tiresome in any of the sections or scenes.  The author's style allows me to easily visualize each scene, really know the characters and feel the action. I can even imagine the subtle nuances and voices so clearly. Character development is superb and the story line knits together and flows well.  This is one incredibly talented author and I am hoping book two in this series is completed soon.
B008XCF7Y6|5.0|I'm a fan of the original starsip troopers and have seen all three movies but now the troopers are digital animated which i think is very cool, now they can have more graphics and detail, just as long as it is given a strong storyline.

B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This story is set in approximately 1992, before cell phones became ubiquitous.  Maggie Newberry's parents sent her to the south of France to deliver $15,000 to men named Roger and Laurent; they had promised that, for that fee, they could deliver to Maggie her sister Elise's 5 year old daughter.  After a couple of weeks, Maggie had her sister's daughter, Nicole, and was returning to Atlanta, having become involved in a relationship with Laurent.  5 months later, Maggie's sister Elise, a drug addict, came back to Atlanta, only to be murdered a few days later.  This book races through Maggie's dogged determination to bring her sister's killer to justice, her budding relationship with Laurent, her boss' decision to sell his advertising agency, and her parents' devotion to Nicole.  It was written well enough to keep you guessing the identity of the killer right up to the end.  There were no typos or formatting errors (which seem to not be too uncommon in ebooks).  A good read.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I enjoy DC/Warner comic adaptations, having seen pretty much all of them.  Also, I understand why some screen writers change small aspects of the story, such as when Dwayne McDuffie changed aspects of the Justice League series that JL: Doom was based on; for example, he changed the specific types of traps Batman had designed for the leaguers, etc. Obviously, this was done to flesh out what was really a very short story within a greater JL tale.  However, I do not understand Bob Goodman's decision to change specific dialog within, in my opinion, the greatest comic written to date.  For instance, the news casters were admirably done, but the fact that there is no mention of the government censorship that they are under is a HUGE gaffe, which undermines the entire reason for the major clash that will occur in the final episode.  Also, certain subtleties in the story-telling were overlooked, such as the last line between the Batman and Harvey Dent: what in God's name is the point of changing that pivotal line?  It's as bad was when they took out the ski scene in Batman: Year One.  Did Mr. Goodman think he was going to receive a poor grade for plagiarism?  That line was supposed to convey that Batman understands that he's as much a victim of his obsession as Dent, that the line between good and evil isn't as wide as we'd like to think.  That our Heroes can easily become villains if the circumstances change.  As other reviewers have noted, it's the nuances of the story-telling that have been left out.  Certainly, the creators all paid the correct amount of reverence to the tale after all it was the pivotal comic of the 80's, bar none.  (Yes, I realize the Watchmen came out at the same time, but I'd argue with anyone that the Watchmen was helped tremendously by the popularity of this particular Batman tale, which took everyone in comics by storm).  Anyway, I digress.  I wish that Bruce Timm, whose work I appreciate, had made certain to comb over the details of the writingso that we could have a 5 star film like Batman: Under the Red Hood.  Still and all, I gave the film 4 stars because it's Miller's Batman, and it doesn't get better than this...(just ask Christopher Nolan!)
B005IQZB14|4.0|A very enjoyable and easy read that has you hooked from the beginning. There are lots of unexpected twists and the ending is very pleasant. Almost didn't want it to end.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I've never even heard of this band before I bought the album. My husband was the one who introduced me to them. I was searching for some music to buy when he said I would like this song. He played it for me and I liked the song so much I looked them up found out that they were not a new band and decided to go ahead and buy the whole album and give them a shot.<br /><br />As I said I never even heard of this band till a few days ago. I wanted to wait till I listened to the entire album before posting a review. I'm very happy with my purchase. I have to admit it was absolutely worth it! The songs are so aggressive and catchy I wake up and hear them playing in my head. Blood an awesome song with the right amount of emotional masochism and pounding music to really get your blood pumping! I'm also really enjoying Adrenalize! Another very catchy song!<br /><br />I haven't listened to metal in a while cause i felt it started sounding redundant. This has a very refreshing sound to it. I'm not sure what it is but there is something about the musical composition along with the lyrics that really caught my attention. I look forward to hearing their other albums and any new ones to come out.<br /><br />The sound was very clear and even. I didn't have to play with the volume on it at all, as you do with some songs. I had no problems with the download mp3 version. I would recommend this album to those who like metal.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book to the point that I was going to tell all my friends<br />that they had to read it or they would miss the \\"book of the year\\". While reading it,<br />I was sure that Oprah would have endorsed it as a book of the month, or whatever her<br />book club called it!! What a let down. Can anyone explain how a book which enthralled<br />readers could end in such a disappointing fashion? Am I the only person who felt that<br />they had wasted their time reading this book?
B000WTBMBK|5.0|If you scoff at the likes of so-called &#34;brostep&#34; dubstep artists like Skrillex and his immense colony of sound-alike followers, give this album a chance. It may just the one for you, regardless of your feelings towards dubstep in general. Out of all the dubstep artists I've heard so far, Burial is the smartest producer out of the pack. What I appreciate the most about his tunes is that they show just how diverse the genre as a whole can be.<br /><br />To give you an idea, Untrue is the polar opposite of Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites (a release I also enjoyed, but thats an entirely different -- and controversial -- subgenre altogether). Instead of coiling together super tight metal-like synths over rave beats set to traditional dubstep tempos, Burial weaves hauntly beautiful acapella samples, mournful ambient melodies, and chilled shuffle UK house/dubstep beats together to create these gorgeous sonic audio angels you hear on this album.<br /><br />In a sense, I feel like this hybrid of dubstep has to be enjoyed in the same way ambient music is enjoyed. Take in the warm vinyl record crackles that grace the quieter moments, the way the sampled echo-y and reverbed vocals complement the overall mournful mood, and even the intricate nature of the beats and ominous (and as one reviewer put it, subway train-like) basslines.<br /><br />Its deep and amazing stuff. In my opinion, not one minute out of this album's 50 minute duration is wasted, even if some tracks are a little better than others. Even the short little two-minute... &#34;interlude&#34; &#34;In McDonalds&#34; (no doubt what is visually depicted on the front cover's artwork) deserves an honorable mention with its fragile heartfelt piano keys and ambient pad.<br /><br />All in all, this is one I strongly recommend for anyone who has appreciation for electronica in any form, but in particular those who think they cannot find a dubstep album they can like. This may be for you. Its dark, subdued, and in a way... its almost downright sophisticated. Give it a listen! Right now! Right now! Right now!!!!!!Give it a listen! Right now! Right now! Right now!!!!!!
B004MPEFBE|5.0|Some people find this movie to drag a bit compared to others. I think it's brilliant. You actually FEEL the impotence and frustration of the characters as you meander with them with no clue as to what is coming next. I love the strong emotions and the relationships.

B008OW1SDY|3.0|My brief review is primarily about the the vinyl release. No need to rehash what other reviewers have said about the music. If you're a fan of Aimee's music, this is a must have release. Great song craft, no doubt about it. Four stars for the music. However, the audio quality of the album is a disappointment IMO. Rather dull sounding high frequencies, no sparkle and little ambiance. Bass is wooly, poorly defined, and not very deep. Soundstage is rather flat and poorly fleshed out. Nothing is overtly horrible, but nothing about this release highlights the charms of a well recorded lp. (Understand my criticisms are given in the context someone who is an audio nut with a high end system.) The mediocre sound of Charmer frustrates this long time fan of Aimee's music because all of the Til Tuesday vinyl releases were exemplary sounding recordings. The graphic design and jacket quality of the lp release are well done and helps justify spending $25 for this. The vinyl is a retro clear orange Jello color. All said, if I'd heard this lp on a friend's system first, I'd have settled for the cd release instead.

B00001OH7O|3.0|I'm not giving this release three stars because of Bowie's music. I have Hunky Dory on vinyl and CD. It was the album that made me sit up and take notice of the Thin White Duke.<br /><br />However, the 1999 reissues released by EMI are \\"enhanced\\" CDs. Two of the CDs in this series have caused me severe problems - crashing a WinXP computer and nearly eating up a CD drive (Hunky Dory wasn't one of the culprits). Of course, it WAS only 1999; perhaps EMI assumed that Win97/ME would be the last ever Windows releases ;~{ . And to be fair, I don't see that many other, or any other, Amazon listeners have had this problem, so you're probably safe (although I've seen mention of problems elsewhere).<br /><br />A better reason to skip the 1999 releases is that later reissues had +/-four bonus tracks each, and they're not just throwaways. If you're seeking to buy Bowie, avoid the 1999 enhanced CDs (as I learned the hard way) and search out the later reissues with the extra tracks. You'll get more music and (possibly) fewer problems. Either way, if you're a Bowie fan, you know how great this music is.

I read all three books in one week.  I absolutely loved this trilogy.  I didn't want it to end.  It left me wanting more.  I can't wait to see the movie!  The story behind the sex is amazing.  I want my own personal Christian Grey (without all the dominate bondage stuff)!

B006LSZECO|3.0|Loved this psychological drama.  Hated the ending.  Kind of like the author ran out of steam at the end and just gave up.  I wanted to write another three chapters so readers wouldn't be left hanging in the air.
0525952926|4.0|After reading Fall of the Giants (and loving it) I too was very excited to read Winter of the World.  The characters in FoftheG were wonderful and you truly cared about them.  The characters in WoftheW were also just as intriguing.  I did learn a lot about WWI in the first book and I learned a lot about WWII in this book.  It was very interesting and reminds us how such a war could start.  It was enlightening to really understand all of the different viewpoints and political parties there were in that time period.  I enjoy how Mr. Follett brings in historical events and characters into these two stories.  I would definitely recommend this book and I honestly think that the author was able to convey how horrible life was in Germany, Russia and England during war times.  You are reminded how much people around the world have suffered.  You could relate to what's happening in the world today and it makes you hope that we have become a smarter world.<br />I also agree that the price Amazon charged for a e-file is outrageous, but when you are traveling, it's very convenient.  Also a complaint that the List of Characters were not included.  I actually went to a bookstore and with my I-phone took a picture of the list of characters which I referenced every now and then.
B00000I8UD|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out. At first I wasn't so taken with it but over time it grew on me like few other albums ever have. The instrumentation, vocals and lyrics are quite beautifully intertwined producing a very evocative musical ecperience.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Again the Killers do not disappoint! Great sound, rhythm, and lyrics! Still love Hotfuss a lot, but this is another great hit!!!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Everytime I read this I find something new. I love it. It's very witty and very entertaining. I cant remember how many times i have read this, at least 5 times and will read it again maybe next year.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|I just loved it, the movie must be like a prequel to resident evil 6. A very nice action, and cheap :D
B004ADH1RI|2.0|I recently ordered this movie to watch with my 7 yr. old grandson.  I barely remembered seeing it when it first came out with my son, who was at the time 12 yrs old.  I recalled it being somewhat of an adventure/mystery, which it is.  However, the kids swear throughout the movie and in one scene, one of the boys is taunting another telling him about seeing his mother naked, taking pictures, etc.  All totally unnecessary for the story line, but I guess Spielberg felt it made it more real.  I shut the movie off before finishing--It is still a good story, but if you try to avoid foul language situations for your kids, this is not going to be ok, especially for younger kids.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|The directing, voices, animation, scoring, sound editing and editing are all leaps and bounds better than Batman: Year One. Much of the nuance and humor in the Frank Miller comic is conveyed in this animated adaptation.
0345803485|5.0|So I'm reading all the reviews for this book and i am quite surprised. Many feel the book is soooo unbelievable, well yea, its a fiction book. I read the first book in 3 days. Its an entertaining book. How many times you watched a love story , well to me, this is like watching a movie (minus the erotic scenes, which are plentiful). If you can't read erotica them i would not suggest you read this book.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Great App! I work night shift and I use it to coverup the noises made by the daywalkers, street noise and those damn cheerful birds :) Get this app if you work nights.
B005UD1D62|5.0|This book was just what I expected after reading Lauren's L.A. Candy books. It was an entertaining and quick read. I enjoyed the story line...the new side of Madison, and the drama that came along with the new reality show. I can't wait for the next book, Starstruck.
B008C0C1Y8|4.0|Let me say that this movie is very underrated and deserves more positive attention.  You get a very good and entertaining movie that has good special effects, action scenes, plot, and awsome sound.  Stallone of course is Judge Dredd and man can he get things done because he respects the law and operates by it.  He feels that the law does not make mistakes, until he is convicted for a murder he did not commit.  He gets teamed up with Rob Schnieder, who he judged strictly to find out why he was framed for the murder.  Rob Schnieder adds a comedic part to the movie, so the movie is not all action.  I was very pleased with this blu-ray and give an awsome B+.
B001LX50I2|5.0|This movie is incredible and I love it. It's far better than the movie \\"Manhunter\\" which was the first made. Anthony Hopkins does an excellent job, yet again, portraying the character of Hannibal Lector. To me, he's the only person who could ever pull off the role. Also, Edward Norton is who I pictured for Will Graham when I read the book. The movie is not too graphic, not like Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal. However, if you're not into suspenseful movies, you might wish to look elsewhere. It's amazing and you should at least give it a try. Definitely watch before you watch Silence of the Lambs or even after.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Whenever someone asks me what my favorite animated film is, I often respond with `The Lion King'.  It's far easier than saying `Grave of the Fireflies' and having them ask me about it and then having them call me to tell me they hate me for recommending it, and it is far less embarrassing than saying `Beauty and the Beast' and having them give me this weird look while they inform me that it is a `little girl's movie'.  I'm not ashamed to say that `The Lion King' probably ranks in at #3 for me and so it is easy for me to use it in that instance.<br /><br />It really is a worthy contender for the throne, and few other animated films have had such a giant impact on the world in general.  I mean, everyone has seen this film and very few contest to its greatness.  Sure, it has its detractors and there has been backlash over the years (probably due to the fact that very few other animated films have attempted to milk their success and adoration as much as this one has) but at the end of the day, `The Lion King' is still ahead of the pack; so-to-speak.<br /><br />When looking back on this film I'm actually pretty shocked that it didn't follow in the footsteps of `Beauty and the Beast' and rack up a deserved Best Picture nomination.  In fact, it towers over many films in that field and is a far better film than the Oscar winner that year.  How a film like `Four Weddings and a Funeral' got a Best Picture nomination over the likes of `The Lion King' is bizarre to me.  The film was a massive success and even went on to win two of the four Oscars it was nominated for.  I'm pretty sure it was close to a nomination, and we all know that it would have been a shoe in with the current rules regarding Best Picture nominees.<br /><br />The reason `The Lion King' is so beloved and the reason it stands the test of time (it is nearly twenty years old) is that it takes those clich&eacute;d or regurgitated themes and gives them a new life.  What is also commendable is that it understands how to make something organic and human out of something completely the opposite.  We're talking about a film about talking animals in the African desert and yet these characters are so human and so relatable.  The rich animation captures the emotional complexities of the story itself, and the fearless way in which themes such as murder, guilt and redemption are tackled was shocking (I remember the newspaper articles attacking the film for being too violent).  At the heart of this film is a story of family and the strength and triumph of spirit.  It is uplifting and soulful and filled to the brim with moments to remember and keep with us.  When one reflects on the relationship that is created between Mufasa and his young son Simba, we become entangled in this beautiful web of emotions.  This is the story of a boy who needed his father, but who ultimately found his father within himself and thus survived a tumultuous childhood to become a hero.<br /><br />So, when someone asks me what my favorite animated film is, I lie, but only a smidgen.ow to make something organic and human out of something completely the opposite.

B0087HT36U|5.0|not really a copy of angry birds, more like crush the castle. It puts its own spin on the genre.
030758836X|4.0|I normally read nonfiction but decided to take the advice of a friend and pick this book up.  I honestly had trouble first stepping into the book.  I didn't like the way it kept switching from the husbands voice to the wife's.  It may also have something to do with the fact that 90% of what I read is nonfiction.  However about 50% through I caught my momentum and got really involved with the characters.  When I was 75% through I couldn't put the thing down and by the time I was done I was happy I had picked up this book.  I am now suggesting it for a program we have at the library I work.  It was that good.  I normally stay away from the new trendy best seller type books, and lean toward the more obscure.  I think this book was just what I needed and would be more than happy to try something different again.  I would recommend this for someone that likes a little suspense and grit.
B007T9FRFS|4.0|Kathy Reichs never disappoints, her books are very informative in area's that most of us know nothing about, and the story line is always gripping..<br /> we can all learn as well as be entertained..,

B007IXWL2C|5.0|The last book in the Trilogy held my suspense and left me wanting more. The only negative I have is that this is the last book. I can only hope EL James comes up with a new series to rival or surpass the Fifty Shades.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great! I loved all of it,  very detailed. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a great story!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|my wife will love this she played this game everytime we go to the fair but this games doesn't have the rude game people that you get the coins from.
0345536886|5.0|I looked at some of the reviews before I got the book and for the life of me can't figure why anyone would go with less than 5 stars.<br />By the numbers folks, Entertaining, raises emotions (Sorrow, revolt, happiness, pity) what more could you ask of a book?<br />Yes I'm sure there are books that hit harder, softer but no one does it better that John Grisham, consistently.<br />I'll be the first to admit that the true-fiction books are sometimes slow, but Mr Grisham's slow books are better than most other author's best works.<br />Having said all this, I hate giving anyone 5 Stars.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Very nice, great action.<br />Not one slow moment.<br />I hope they do a sequel.<br /><br />Must see if you like action hero movies!

0425263908|2.0|So I read Fifty Shades of Grey (all 3), having never read \\"erotic romance.\\" I was totally hooked by it --- loooved it. It was so much fun. I thought the combo of Ana's earnest \\"Oh My!\\" attitude and the raunchy mercurial Christian was witty, sexy, and fresh. Yeah, it was a little overwritten (especially the 3rd book), but over all very happy-making.<br /><br />Fast forward a month or two and I'm looking for another book like the Grey books. Bared to You is the one that floats up repeatedly so of course I got it.<br /><br />Not even close. Warning to all you Grey lovers...not even close.<br /><br />Here's why (no plot spoilers just some general references)<br /><br />1 - No humor or wit in the main characters. The sidekick best friend Cary is a hoot but he is in and out. Gideon and Eva are soooo serious and even dull in their dialogue. (Sometimes I wished Eva would dump Gideon for Cary).<br /><br />2 - The characters become predictable pretty fast. They are emotionally up and down like yo-yo's but always in the same way = repetitive. Also no fantasy distractions. No helocopters, boat trips, gallery shows, fancy dinners, etc. Why date a troubled billionaire unless he has a fun side?<br /><br />3 - The sex scenes are not sexy, more like a combination of olympic events and the barnyard. Very graphic. Very many of them. Lots of heaving around. The lack of humor, panache, and subtlety made them empty. By the end the writer seems to be trying to top the previous 20 sex scenes so it gets ridiculous. Also, some of the language she uses is crass and some is just odd.<br /><br />4 - It doesn't \\"go\\" anywhere. They are the same at the end that they were in the beginning only they have had sex alot. I know the Grey books are fantasies, but at least the characters do change grow and reveal themselves.<br /><br />5 - 2 dimensional characters. In the Grey books, we see the music, food, hobbies, workplaces, toys, and books that the characters like. We see Ana's goofy real hardware store job, her apartment, emails, and college friends. In Bared, the cupboard is bare. Not much of anything outside sex, arguing, sex and arguing. There are occasional respites in the form of Cary. But really if this is to be believed, Gideon and Eva do the following things ONLY: get dressed up, get undressed, have sex, talk about inner torture, and fight. Repeat ad nauseum.<br /><br />So bah humbug. No successor here. I would have liked it if Day could lighten it up a bit. Use some clever instead of cleavage some of the time. Oh well - back to looking...
B0081HLMD8|5.0|I like everything in the movie. Great story and the timing of the plot was excelent. Thanks to Amazon's reviews I bought it, and it was totally worth it.
0345803485|5.0|Hard as it is to admit, this trilogy is a blast. I'm not, structly speaking, a bestseller person. I love Anna Karenina, Unbearable Lightness of Being and In the Garden of Beasts. I can be a little stuck up when it comes to pop culture fiction. But this summer when I had a long recovery from surgery ahead of me, a friend recommended this book. I didn't even know what it was about. I was just in a hurry so I bought it.<br /><br />So glad I did! What a fun vacation of a read. I was not looking for scorching erotica or a send-up of classic British romance novels. But this is both. I loooooved the fact that Ana's voice is so naive and genuine. I liked that she had that geeky \\"Oh my\\"<br />habit. I loved the fact that her shock at her own sexuality caused her shamefaced embarassment. I even liked that she awkwardly fumbled around with the language of sex. It lent authenticity and humor to her voice. So many novels of all kinds swoon around in the language of perfume ads when it comes to love and sex. No cliche \\"throbbing members\\" or \\"heaving breasts\\" here - but the wackily named \\"apex of the thighs.\\" Once Sex and the City happened, we all knew the sexually savvy twentysomething and thirtysomething unleashed on the Manhattan single scene. This is a different voice and another strong point of view.<br /><br />The cinematic way James captures moment to moment life between the two lead characters is fresh and interesting. It is almost like watching closeups move from one character to another. She captures the way communication and emotions flicker across the face and change suddenly on the mention of a word or even on a look. It is a very visual book and I think that is one of the reasons why it captures such a huge audience now. We are used to images and film editing. I think she masters that here. The variety is not in exotic word choice, but in the way the moments move across the page.<br /><br />I also loved the character of Christian. He was over the top and too much fromhis first appearance in the book. Even Ana sees that he is way too full of himself. I like the way he slowly begins to laugh about himself. This is a very real phenomenon. Love and acceptance make it easier to laugh at our greatest flaws and vulnerabilities. I think it is cool that James successfully wrote somebody very sexy AND ridiculous. Almost both at the same time.<br /><br />The email part of the courtship was one of my favorite aspects of this story. Both characters revealed more in their email, opened up more. Their exchanges had real immediacy to them. They brought to mind the witty banter that characters have in older comedies like Philadelphia Story. I know, I realize PS is a masterpiece and I am not saying this is a masterpiece, but there was that quick witted repartee.<br /><br />The sex is obviously there and it is a mix. Sometimes those scenes are over the top fantasy and soemtimes they are sweet or intimate. I think James like Christian is at her best in building anticipation. This is not a two animals mating in a jungle type book, nor a series of slick acrobatics - thank goodness. It circles around the thrill of what will happen next plus a little threat of danger. It was interesting to get a peek into one version of the BDSM lifestyle.<br /><br />I imagine that in \\"erotic fiction\\" readers are happy with lots of imaginative sex scenes. James' attempt at psychological layering, while flawed, was also highly ehgaging and takes the book beyond the sex angle. Nor did she have to bring us \\"our time\\" in such ringing vivid color but the books, wine, music, food, Seattle skyline, etc made this a full world for me. I also love the fantasy of the billionaire that she brings with the helicopter, plane, glider, boat, fancy dinners, gorgeous houses, cars, etc. I mean why not? In the times we are in now, escape to such a fantasy lifestyle is a cool breeze in a hot room.<br /><br />Finally - when I read the reviews at first, this was a big five star read. Now thenaysayers are having their day, and I read some of their reviews and am a bit perplexed. When you pick up Fifty Shades, you are stopping by for a great pizza. You shouldn't look at your plate and expect lobster or endive. Pizza is gooey, delicious, and a little bit bad for you. And a lot of fun. Just like this book!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not a spoiler. Author Gillian Flynn weaves a fascinating tale with this story. The first thing that jumps out at you is that nothing is as it appears. The characters are complex and flawed. As the story progresses, it becomes clear(as mud)the main characters each have an agenda, that they are willing to do anything to hide. The story makes you pause an think about relationships, such as, husband and wife, brother and sister, parent and child, as well as, friendships. Who are you and with whom are you in relationship? The answer to the questions may mean life or death. As the adage goes,\\"There are three sides to the story, his side, her side and the truth\\". In Gone Girl, you get to read his and her sides of the story. The truth is left up to you.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|super easy to use there is nothing more that can be said about this easy to use calculator that I got free with my fire
0345803485|1.0|I have no idea why this book is so popular. I like erotica but well written erotica. 50 Shades of Grey, Book One, is sophomoric and repetitious not to mention boring. After a while, I was counting the times Ana says Oh My, Holy Crap, Holy Shit, Oh Shit, bites her bottom lip, and has an orgasm at the drop of a hat. No, that's not right, a hat didn't have to drop for her to have an orgasm. Christian is so completely a college girl's fantasy and unbelievable as a character. I laughed through some of his ridiculous scenarios. Some of the sex scenes were titillating--but seriously, save your money. I was very ticked off that I paid almost $10 for my Kindle version!
630542828X|5.0|A Civil Action is an oldie but goodie if you are teaching a torts class to a community college or high school crowd. It should be used at the start of the course and then can be referenced throughout, if a proper course track is implemented.

B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I love Ed Sheeran! I heard about him from one direction. I think he is an amazing singer. He always write things about life that anyone can relate to. He has the voice of an angel
B005V1WZ10|5.0|I have been a Korn fan since 1997, and they are always pushing the envelope.<br />It's unfair to categorize this album and Korn in general, but  one this is for sure<br />they will push the envelope and make the music heavy! This album kicks ass!<br />You want Jonathan davis screaming you got it! Heavy riffs! and HUGE bass!
B008NW67E0|5.0|The album \\"Babel\\" makes me a bigger fan of folk rock music. The voice of Marcus Mumford makes my heart soar on the title track.  \\"Ghosts That We Knew\\" is a slower tempo track. Every chord of Marcus Mumford's guitar is beautiful.  This song is very soothing and reflective to me.\\"The Boxer\\" is one of my favorite songs of all time. I have never heard this song with a banjo accompaniment.  The banjo playing by Country Winston Marshall makes this song special for me. \\"I Will Wait\\" is a track where all four musicians perform in perfect unison. Ted Dvane plays the upright bass. Ben Lovett brings his energy on the keyboards on this song. This is an upbeat love song. \\"Holland Road\\" is a track that features the mandolin.  This instrument makes a goregous sound.  It gives this song a romantic tone that I love. \\"Not With Haste\\" is a song that I originally heard on the the soundtrack for the animated movie Brave.  It is listed under the song title \\"Learn Me Right\\". This song fills my heart with a sense of hope. I don't care what title this song is listed as.  It is simply superb. \\"Hopeless Wanderer\\" is a song that starts off slow, but it picks up in the middle.  I really love the musical arrangement on this track.  \\"For Those Below\\" is a pretty song with fiddle playing.  This song has a spiritual theme in the lyrics that I love. The music of Mumford and Sons gives me a new appreciation for the folk rock music genre.

B005LAIHR2|5.0|This movie was panned by critics and was out of the theaters really fast. Lucky for me, my daughter & I saw first weekend. We sang along as knew every song. We laughed until I was crying at one point (with Baldwin & Brand) I recommended this movie to 5 other couples, 4 got there before it left town and loved it! These are people in 40's, 50's & 60's. I am not a Cruise fan at all, but have to say he was really great.  I do recommend this movie to any one alive and listening to music in the 80's. I am buying DVD and having a girls night out!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I am the first to admit that I'm not a follower of the Marvel comic series. While I love graphic novels, comic books have never really been something that I sought out. But, I am familiar with all of the characters due to various Saturday morning cartoons growing up. The biggest motivating factor for me to see this movie is the fact that Joss Whedon directed it. You should know Joss Whedon...he created Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, and Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog to name a few.<br /><br />In the movie, The Avengers, your superheros are Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye and the Hulk.There are quiet a few standalone movies for each of these characters except for Hawkeye and Black Widow. Iron Man is the first of the Avengers to be called on an assignment to save the world. He is invited by Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who is organizing a team that is this planet's best shot of protecting it. And the bad guy?<br /><br />He is Loki, Thor's step-brother, from the previous Thor movie. Loki is bent on revenge and has teamed up with an alien race that will help him subjugate the human race in exchange for the Tesseract (a mystical blue glowing box). Each member of the Avengers is contacted and they must all find reasons to come together and fight as a team. Their first encounters with each are volatile but, as always, they work beautifully as a team when the need is greatest.<br /><br />This movie, despite the enormous cast and potential for a huge failure, does not disappoint! There are a lot of very touching, emotional moments regarding each of the character's personal histories. You get to understand their motivations and why they act the way they do. I found this to be the most significant movie for character development because so much changes for each character. I would love to see a movie with Hawkeye and Black Widow. They could make a great spy/assassin movie! Alright Joss Whedon, make it happen! I would have to say that my 2 favorite scenes of this movie are: The Hulk/Loki fight and the first fight between Thor and Iron Man.ite scenes of this movie are: The Hulk/Loki fight and the first fight between Thor and Iron Man.
B008IJHIAA|5.0|[NOTE: other reviews of this release may be from the 2005 DualDisc/SACD release, NOT the 2012 box set.]<br /><br />This album's reissue presumably represents the finale in the REM-IRS reissue series, and it's arguably the most important album in their catalog and one of the most far-fetched albums in what would no longer be called punk rock.  REM arrived at the tail end of punk's old guard, when labels like SST and Frontier were in their final heyday, and steered punk toward a provincial, folksy simplicity. Compare their first two albums to Dream Syndicate, Minutemen, and Green on Red, and you get a nice trajectory.  But by 1987, things were very different: punk's tentative adulthood had to contend with MTV and \\"Joshua Tree\\" bombast, and REM knew to evolve.  \\"Document\\" was a punk album with a shiny, energetic surface - but underneath, it was stranger, darker, and heavier than anything they had dared do before.<br /><br />The key is not to make too much of the strong MTV-fueled singles, stellar and designer-simple as they are, and instead focus on the weird pieces elsewhere.  \\"Disturbance at the Heron House\\", \\"King of Birds\\", and \\"Fireplace\\" are lyrically and musically so far off the map it's hard to imagine any band ever playing such music.  By the time \\"King of Birds\\" devolves into a wind-blown dirge, you can hear shades of the emotional intimacy they would later pursue on post-Warners stuff like \\"Automatic for the People\\" and \\"Up\\" - mood music, heavy and deep and thoughtful and distant.  \\"Document\\" beyond the hit singles is the sound of REM growing up, confident.<br /><br />The extra CD here is just ridiculously good.  A live show from the Netherlands that seethes with energy and power, this recording shows REM in their final IRS years as a live band with no equal, throwing songs off a cliff with ease.  Listen to the way they twist \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" and \\"Finest Worksong\\" into massive, hammering punishments. The singles are almost too much to bear in this context, Pete Buck going completely haywire like a seer discovering the full power of an unknown gift. At this point in their careers, REM was about to send punk rock on its way and embrace something bigger and more self-challenging.<br /><br />And what a send-off it was.  REM had taken punk rock from its hidden beginnings to a different place, and beyond that there was uncertainty and fame. But \\"Document\\" remains the \\"finest hour\\" (to quote a screeching lyric of imminent arrival), an album that really can't be measured against their earlier classics but one that stands in between the freer, Econoline van-tour era of their Athens origins and a worldly stage of big-message authority., Pete Buck going completely haywire like a seer discovering the full power of an unknown gift.

B002VECLVY|4.0|My then roommate and movie-watching buddy R had been dying to see A Single Man, Tom Ford's directorial debut.  The waiting list at the Fine Arts Library was pretty long, but she eventually got it and we watched it that very night.  It left an impression.<br /><br />I've never read the Christopher Isherwood novel, but I enjoyed the movie.  The movie's strength is not the story, but the images it uses to tell that story.  Tom Ford's use of color and framing is very striking.<br /><br />Following the death of his partner (Matthew Goode), George (Colin Firth) intends to commit suicide.  The whole movie is muted by his grief, few things truly engaging his senses.  Firth does a wonderful job of portraying the character's emotional turmoil, hidden behind a strong front, and Ford's direction backs up his feeling.<br /><br />The other actors aren't given as much to do, but they're delightfully ambiguous.  Their motives and feelings aren't entirely clear to George or the viewer.  Julianne Moore plays Charley, George's best friend and one of the few people he wants to see on his last day.  The ridiculously gorgeous Nicholas Hoult plays Kenny, a student of George's who basically stalks him.  (Whenever I see About a Boy, I am amazed how goofy he looked as a kid.)<br /><br />A Single Man is very stylized and thus not for everybody.  It is not a warm film.  It has a very cold, mannered surface.  But it works because of the core of vulnerability that Firth embodies.  George's weakness is not easily seen, but it's very affecting.<br /><br />There's also a memorable moment of black comedy towards the end of A Single Man, as George tries to stage his suicide perfectly.  No matter how much he fusses, he can't seem to find a neat and dignified way to shoot himself.  It's a terrible thing to laugh at, but it's a perfect funny and sad scene.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Straightforward retelling that has the virtue of being exactly what it purports to be - the story of the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. There is enough discussion of the author's life and career to develop a \\"generic\\" feel for the men who were selected for the attempt. Unlike many of the books in this genre there is very little chest-beating about the training difficulty or the SEAL mystique or angst about war (all of which may be deserved but are often overdone to the detriment of the stories being told). There is a studied and successful effort at avoiding any political narrative, neither left vs right nor pacifist vs hawk is spun. Buy this book to get an easy read that tells one story - how did the mission go down as seen by one of the 23 key participants. If you judge a book by how well it accomplishes its stated goals then this one is perfect.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game was great. I play a lot of games like this (like lost city, crimson manor, grizzly manor, etc.) this is one of the best ones I have ever played. well worth the $1.99 price. the game is not short, it took a while to play and if you get stuck the hint button is very helpful. great graphics, great storyline...great! great! great! played on kindle fire, never had a problem with glitches or anything. I hope more games come out like this! (:

B0097DRYZA|4.0|As the title would indicate this is one of my favorite movies, that being said it is not a \\"deep\\" or \\"thoughtful\\" or even very realistic movie.  It is a good ol good guys vs bad guys, with the good guys being outnumbered and trying to save the hard working settlers.  Kind of like an old fashion Western movie but set in a sic-fi setting.  The movie tries to make some comments on society like soldiers trained from childhood under a harsh and tyrannical system that are just stored in a cabinet labeled \\"break glass in case of war\\", but it really falls short in any real meaningly message.  There is just not enough time taken to develop this aspect of the film as most of it is dedicated to action scenes.  Still it is enjoyable and I watch movies to be entertained and escape rather than educated and in the entertainment and escape department this film delivers.  You find yourself cheering for the underdog good guys when they do in the bad guys!

B008MG1E4A|4.0|HOOYAH, Chief \\"Owen\\"<br /><br />As a former Operator myself, At first I was highly PO'd about this book and what it could contain  and the fact that here is another \\"brother\\" selling out for money. This wasnt the case. As usual the hype exceeded the substance. N.E.D. was well written and very on point. It didnt spill any facts or leak information that our own Commander in Chief's staff didnt leak out so he could take credit for what these warriors accomplished.<br />CPO \\"Owen\\" told the story accurately and stole the thunder from the biased and usually WRONG media in their portrail of this mission and the Operators who carried it out. It goes into great detail the thought process and workups that lead to the success or even failures of some of these missions without the \\"Hollywood-Charlie Sheen\\" version.<br />If you ever wanted a good insite into what NSW community and the support teams that work with us do and believe in, then get this book. Dont forget that Chief \\"Owen\\" is donating most of his proceeds to charities that support and aid the families of NSW Operators we have lost on far away crappy battlefields and in training to win this never ending war on terrorism. Bravo Zulu! OUUTT!!!
0525952926|5.0|It was a great look at the period leading up to and during WWII from multiple vantage points.  The only knock I have is that the stories of Erick and Inspector Macke were not more defined.  I would have liked to read from the point of view of someone who sympathized with the Nazis and their reasoning.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I enjoyed the book but thought the ending seemed a little contrived.  The ending seemed to come out of nowhere rather then letting the store move in that direction.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|A Feast for Crows, the fourth installation of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, was focal shift very different from the last three books.  At this point, he decides to take us on a trip through the perspectives of people across the water and Cersei.  There are some minor lapses of language where you are reminded that really this is a fantasy only written as if in some Old English (or whatever language we're supposed to be imagining) but the author is as modern as you or I (He has twice used Sweet and it felt rather 1990s.  I expect him to say \\"Cool\\" or \\"sick\\" like a skater dude.)<br /><br />But truly the story is positively riveting and the chapters from character perspective have continued to be all the first three novels have led us to expect.  Indeed I find the suspense of one character's section for the next to be more than I can take as I really only like 3 characters and want him to stop sharing these other persons' viewpoints so I can hear from my favorites.  Talk about soap-opera drama at the end of the hour.<br /><br />If you like medieval style literature, violence, fantasy and have no fear of a good long read, this is the next best installation.<br /><br />On \\"Wait Wait Don't Tell me', I heard the books refered to as Crack and George RR Martin was cast as the only Crack Dealer in the world.  Too true! Go ahead, take a hit.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've been looking for something that would put an edge on my pocket knife. I use and abuse the thing and don't need to shave with it.  Just a couple of strokes with the honesteel and it's stunning how well it works. Would be great for the tackle box or to obtain a quick edge when dressing out game.  It's an inexpensive tool that I wish I owned a long time ago.

1119962846|5.0|Given the series' reputation, R for Dummies should be suited for readers with little or no experience in programming or R. After a cover to cover read, I can say that this book delivers. It helps to have some experience with a command line interface paradigm (in other words, you should not be afraid of typing commands into the computer) or at the least, to be susceptible to some new concepts. The book guides the reader through every step from a blinking console cursor to a handsome trellis graphic and assumes no prior experience with R.<br /><br />Throughout the book, all the examples are executable, which means that the reader can have a rich hands-on (dare I say fun?) experience with managing the data. Topics covered give the reader enough to start and regularly invite him or her to further explore the topic in very rich documentation that already comes with R and add-on packages. The book works as a map for navigating around main streets but an inquisitive reader can (and should) always make turns into smaller alleys to explore issues further.<br /><br />The book is ready to be read from cover to cover or be a light reference for when you're starting out coding your analysis. The authors did a great job introducing topics that literally may take thousands of pages to explain in detail (e.g. advanced graphics, introductory statistics). From my experience with teaching R to scientists and students, it is that information overload which can be a problem. This book eases the reader into basic structures and slowly builds on them, giving time for that knowledge to settle.<br /><br />Introduction to various popular packages is very useful and gives the reader a good starting ground to tackle data crunching on their own. Authors endorse various software and techniques, but do not hide the alternatives. They do not cover any specific add-on packages (like biology, finance, market research, high performance computing) but touch the tools that will be useful to everyone.<br /><br />The book has about 350 pages, which is moderate for an introductory material. Even though this work is not meant to be comprehensive, most, if not all, topics that a regular user of R comes across daily are covered. Given the affordable price, in my opinion this book is well worth the purchase. I would recommend it to beginners and if you're already comfortable with R maybe as a gift to a person who is too afraid to board the R express headed for Data city.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I've been anticipating this album for months and it doesn't disappoint!  I've seen reviews of the single I Will Wait saying that it was boring and sounded like every other Mumford song...isn't that the point? They have a unique sound which is why so many people like myself love them! They didn't try and change their style to be more mainstream sounding in this album as many other artists try to do with their sophomore albums.  They stayed true to themselves and what their fans love so much.  Another great album from a great band!

B000FC1LOC|5.0|I've read a few Jodi Picoult books and this is one of the ones I've wanted to read for awhile.  Anna wants to fight for medical emancipation, which means she doesn't want to divorce her parents, she just wants to be in charge of what happens to her medically.  She's been a bone marrow donor to her sister who has had APL a form of leukemia as well as gone through other medical procedures.  Now she's fighting for control over what happens to her own body, just as her sister is in need for a kidney transplant.  With some money she's saved up she shows up at Campbell's office.  She's seen that he gets things done.  While she can't afford his actual services there is something about her that compels to agree to take her case.  And the publicity that could result can lead to other high profile clients in the future.  Taking on her case is not going to be easy as opposing council is Anna's own mother and so she's assigned a professional to decide what's in the best interest of her, which also ends up being Julia(a woman from Campbell's past).<br /><br />There is a bit of a mystery to Campbell as he has a service dog, but he's not blind.  Which is what everyone he runs across assumes what the dog is for once they are informed it's a service dog.  Some of the man's responses to their questions about it are pretty funny.  Representing Anna is not easy as there are many times it looks like she's not sure exactly what she wants and there are moments whether or not he questions whether he's still pursuing the lawsuit.  Which is a challenge because if she doesn't know what she wants then how can she prove that she's capable of making her own medical decisions, which is the whole point of the case that she wants to be free to make her own medical decisions.  In the end she may end up giving her sister her kidney, but after years of having various medical procedues done she finally wants to have a say with what happens with her own body.  She also wants to be finally be heard.<br /><br />The story unfolds over the course of the book with various points of view by various members of Anna's family along with her lawyer and Julia.  Part of the mother's story is set in the past as we get various details about Kate's medical history.  Her whole life since she was about two years old has been divided between being sick and some moments of being absolutely healthy.  Unfortunately she's been sick more then she's been healthy.  She's beaten the odds big time where her disease is concerned but now her kidney's are failing and the dialysis she undergoes is no longer working.  If she doesn't get a kidney transplant real soon then she's going to die.  It's revealed in the book that even if she gets the kidney there are no guarantees.  After years of facing her death, her parents are no better prepared to say goodbye then when she first got the diagnosis when she was a little girl.  An awful lot of the family's life has revolved around Kate and sometimes the other two kids have fallen through the cracks, especially Jesse as he's neither the one who is sick nor is the one who has been able to do something about it.  The only reason he gets any attention at all is that he's the family screw up.<br /><br />The book unwinds itself around a two week period of time, as Anna's case works it's way through the courts leading up to the day of the hearing.  The hearing which can determine whether or not she is legally emancipated.  Things are pretty strained in the family as each member struggles to hold it together between Kate's hospitalization and Anna's court case.  Not being able to breathe between the court case and what's going on with her sister, Anna ends up temporarily moving in with her father at the firehouse he workss at as a firefighter.  Over the course of the few days the hearing takes place we are treated to a few surprises.  You find out what the service dog is for and the real reason Anna filed the lawsuit.  Not to mention what happens after the verdict in the case is read and makes you wonder if the family would have done anything differently if they had known what the ultimate outcome was going to be.  As is usual based on the other Jodi Picoult books I have read, there is one heck of a twist at the end of the book.  Whether or not it ruins the rest of the story, is really up to the individual reader.  But after reading this book I will continue to read Jodi Picoult books in the future.
0547258305|4.0|Here we go again, I thought. A spunky girl whose name begins with \\"Kat\\" with mad archery skills, no clue all the guys are in love with her, and what have we got? Katniss. Very original.<br /><br />But I was wrong. Kristin Kashore's Katsa is original. For one thing, she precedes Katniss. (Graceling was actually published two years before The Hunger Games). Second of all, while I love Katniss to death (she definitely ranks among my top heroines--accompanied by Lyra, Hermione, Viola, Cassandra from I Capture the Castle, and Skye from Girl Walking Backwards), Katsa's definitely got her own things going on.<br /><br />Take her magical ability, for instance. Katsa is a Graceling--a human being with a special ability, which is marked by two differently colored eyes (one blue, the other green). Only unlike other Gracelings, whose talents are swimming, storytelling, etc., Katsa's is killing. Because of this, she becomes the henchman of her father, King Randa, and must punish \\"wrongdoers\\" throughout his kingdom. At the same time, Katsa also runs a secret society behind her uncle's back: The Council, a group of people who carry out virtuous missions throughout the kingdoms. It is on one of these missions that Katsa meets Prince Po, a silver-hooped Graceling (he has silver and gold eyes), and the story really starts to get good. After looking into a kidnapping, Po and Katsa find themselves on a quest to to save a young princess and her people from their Graceling King, a young, eye-patched ruler with the dangerous gift of persuasion.<br /><br />One thing that makes Graceling stand out among other young adult fantasy books is its use of character development. In the beginning, Katsa comes off as tough and fearsome in a fight, but overall, a bit bland. But as the story progresses and she gets to know Prince Po (he's the only other person who can make her sweat in a fight, so they begin training together), she starts to change and consequently, becomes a lot more interesting. Po also changes as we learn a secret about him (don't worry, no spoilers--I'll just say his Graceling power is not what you think it is), and later on as he and Katsa develop a relationship. Also, on that front, I don't think I've ever read a young adult novel that's ever captured such a realistic dynamic between a boy and a girl who become lovers. Whether Po is teasing her about ruining her horse (she rides ridiculously hard), or she's asking him about the rings he wears on his fingers, or about what it's like back home, you really feel like you're witnessing two people in the midst of the exciting process of getting to know one another.<br /><br />I also really like the twist on Po's Grace. I'm not going to give it away, but suffice to say that it definitely makes you think about what it means to get to know a person. I would finish an exchange of dialogue between Po and Katsa and still find myself thinking about it afterwards and what I would have done in that situation. And that is when you know a book is good. I also really liked what Kashore does with Po's character. Even when you think all is well and finished, a new factor enters the equation that definitely challenges and changes Po. Kudos to Kashore for taking that risk, because it definitely pays off. Instead of alienating us from Po, we find that instead of being perfect, he's real. And that just makes us like him more.<br /><br />I also found the main villain pretty fascinating--the fact that simply by speaking, he can manipulate people. This definitely made me think about how all their Graces could be in a way, extensions of real-live talents: the ability to fight really well or be really good with words. I guess the question then becomes, what does it mean to have a natural ability that hurts others? Does it mean that we should accept that \\"with great power, comes great responsibility\\" and therefore use our ability to protect other people? And do these abilities define who we are? Or is Katsa to some extent, also the girl who resists what she is?<br /><br />Anyways, the fact that a young adult book has made me think this much says enough. That aside, there are some things this book definitely could have done better. For starters, the plot. I'm pretty lenient with books that use their first half for development/setting up the conflict. As long as we get there eventually. With Graceling, though, I never really felt that action happened. I mean this is a book about two Gracelings with mad fighting skills, and they never even fight the bad guy. What happens instead is a kind of skirting of climactic fighting. Minutes after meeting the Graceling King, Po and Katsa run away (although for a good reason), and then it's survival in the freezing mountains until finally Katsa and the Graceling King reunite, and when we're least expecting it, she kills him. As realistic as this felt, it left me disappointed. It's not that I wanted fighting, so much as more interaction. I wanted the good guys and bad guys to be in each other's space more. There's also the fact that the Graceling King had a lot of potential. With his clever ways and manipulative charm, he definitely made for an intriguing character. If only he could have been developed a little bit more.<br /><br />All the same, the characters all very compelling (even the minor ones), and Katsa and Po's relationship is so real (one minute they're kissing, the next they're arguing), I couldn't help but want to keep reading. Po especially makes for a unique male protagonist, especially after what happens to him at the end. He has this one line that I just love: \\"Everything's trying to form one picture. And I can feel my place like I couldn't before. I mean, I'm still overwhelmed. But nothing like before\\" (459). Sensual and yet in a way that's completely honest, he definitely makes for a different kind of lover. So whether you're gravitating towards Graceling for its lovely lady killer, its gentle, silver-hooped hottie, or if you've ever wondered about what it'd be like to have a special power (although I assure you, you have one), please do yourself a favor and read it. Maybe it won't blow you away, but it will definitely make you think.nt, also the girl who resists what she is?<br /><br />Anyways, the fact that a young adult book has made me think this much says enough.

1451608659|4.0|I'm a year older then Dominique and remember watching the '96 Olympic Games with much interest. I thought the book gave great insight to the life of a young gymnast training for the Olympics. I wasn't a big fan of the story telling of the book, jumping from her childhood to talking about Jennifer or something else in the present day. But that was the only downside to the book. Overall if your a fan of the '96 Olympic team or gymnastics, I'd recommend this book.

B002RVCD0U|5.0|I almost didn't watch this movie because I could never stomach Christian Bale & by the time I was finished watching it, I had totally changed my mind about him!! I now LOVE him but especially adore Sam Worthington!! This was top notch special effects & amazing acting by all in the movie. The story line was fantastic and well written also. I think I have watched this at least 20 times already and I never get sick of it! I totally recommend this to add to your \\"Terminator\\" collection.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An excellent no BS account of a historical event and what it took for the hand picked team to get there.  The book flows through events and prior training of the main character and he portrays his feelings on the significance of the titled mission.  Though I am not a former Navy SEAL myself, I have been stationed at many of the bases described in the book during my career in the Navy and as a Army Contractor in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the descriptions of these places are very clear in the book.  However, though many the locations were described well, many key places or names of these places were left out, so I am not sure where the American government says there was classified information in this book.  Most of what was described about the SEALS in this book is public knowledge and can be found through research.  Once I started reading I could not put the book down and felt similar feelings the characters felt once the mission to take Osama down was completed.  Unless one is an actual Navy SEAL or in Special Forces, no book can describe 100% of what it takes to be one and what feels like to be the best of the best, but this book touches on this from time to time.

B009329ZF2|4.0|Is it worth watching? Yes. It's fun, lot's of action and plenty of eye candy.  However, don't expect a movie with a lot of depth or that makes a lot of sense.  Very loosely based on the board game and I do mean loosely.  It has the underdog character who starts off as a screw-up and rises to the occasion and becomes the hero.  You have the cripple that has given up and then finds new reason to fight etc...  You've seen it all before in films like Independence Day, but that didn't make it any less fun to watch.  One thing that stood out at me was how much the film tried to be another Top Gun movie for the Navy and I'm sure the Navy was hoping for that as well, but I thought they tried too hard and fell a little short.  It's not a film I would necessarily pay to see in the theaters, but as a rental flick definitely.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|best game ever. they could add some more mini games to it though. another good thing would be to make the acorns a little easier to get. because the whole &quot;pay for it&quot; thing I don't do since its a video game not life.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This would be THE Klondike app to get, except for one tiny issue.<br /><br />The gameplay is perfect, and the options to correct your mistakes keep it out of the &quot;frustrating&quot; category.<br /><br />The one issue I have with it is the full-screen ads, especially the video ads. The method to dismiss them varies based on the particular ad. I can easily believe another reviewer who says the ads pop up randomly even after &quot;quitting&quot; the game. More than likely it's still running in the background. I have not had this issue, but I regularly use Task Manager to keep the background tasks under control for reasons like this.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Just like some of the songs from their previous album Sigh No More, such as the song 'Dust Bowl Dance', it can take a few minutes for the catchy hook.  Babel is just as lyrically deep and before long you just want to sing along.  If you liked their first album, buying this one is a no-brainer.  If I had to pick a favorite song, it would have to be 'Ghosts That We Knew'.<br /><br />I just think it's a shame some of their songs are not radio ready because of the slow build up it requires the listener to think for the first half.  People would just tune to another station.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This album is beautiful. Truly. It doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />There's always a bit of trepidation when you start listening to a second release by a band/musician that you love- you worry that there'll be some dramatic change in musical style or songwriting, etc.<br /><br />But have no worries- the classic Mumford & Sons sound is totally here- if anything, it sort of FLOURISHES on \\"Babel\\". There are the great, clever lyrics (\\"press my nose up to the glass around your heart\\"), the layered building of each song into a sort of soaring crescendo, all that good stuff. Just even better. Their sound is richer without being too polished or manufactured in any way. They are all just doing more of what they are so good at.<br /><br />I love that this album is designed as a whole- there was clearly a lot of thought put in the way the songs were ordered. In this age of MP3s and individual tracks, arranging tracks for an album seems to be something  some artists don't too much thought to, but there's a nice structure to \\"Babel\\", as a whole. I have enjoyed listening to it as a complete album, which is sort of rare these days. When it's over I just start it up at the beginning and play it all again. Even the more spare songs (which I don't love as much as I love when the band goes all out) appeal to me when the album is played as a whole.<br /><br />My favorite thing about Mumford & Sons is that when they play, whether live or on their albums, you can almost *hear* the circle they might be standing in, hear the connection between the musicians, hear the music reverberating off the walls, hear that they are playing together as opposed to facing in one direction and playing off into the distance. There's an energy in their music that seems to be formed from the way the songs sound like true collaborations rather than \\"there's the drums, there's the vocals, here comes the guitar, here's some banjo...\\" And this sort of \\"connection\\" that they seem to have, musically, is even more apparent on this album.<br /><br />As far as their cover of \\"The Boxer\\"- I have to admit, I'm a huge fan of Simon and Garfunkel and I was both super excited and super nervous to hear Mumford's take on the classic song- it's sort of one of those \\"holy grail\\" songs to me. But it's lovely version of the song- of course, it's not as epic as the original, but it has found a place on my latest playlist and if it helps expose S&G to a new generation, that would be amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line- I can't stop listening to \\"Babel\\" and I don't *want* to. It's a lovely album, very moving, very clever, very sweet, all at the same time. I highly recommend it.parent on this album.<br /><br />As far as their cover of \\"The Boxer\\"- I have to admit, I'm a huge fan of Simon and Garfunkel and I was both super excited and super nervous to hear Mumford's take on the classic song- it's sort of one of those \\"holy grail\\" songs to me.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel is a must-read....but you need to have a friend read it, too, because it prompts so many moral and ethical questions you HAVE to have someone to discuss them with!  A fascinating look at individuals and relationships in tragic circumstances.

1400069289|3.0|The book's first few chapters were very promising, but then it descended into endless stories about American football. To understand key concepts in this book, you will have to be familiar with the words \\"touchdown\\", \\"quarterback\\", \\"superbowl\\", team names and other concepts in the American football lexicon. I can see why an American audience would be happy with such anecdotes, but to non Americans like me, it was torture to go through them. Nevertheless, underneath that pile of American football rubbish, lies the diamond of a good and useful book.

0061564893|1.0|This book is written in a vacuum. For Menzies to make his thesis persuasive, he has to first of all engage consensus understandings of the historical past he's trying to revise. By not acknowledging longstanding and well-established views that challenge his outlook, Menzies can present his \\"findings\\" as if he were the first person ever to take an interest in the maps and other artifacts he uses to build his argument. The book is like a detective story with Menzies as the intrepid investigator, fully oblivious, it seems, that many others--and some much better qualified--have studied the evidence in question and given it a very different interpretation. But I doubt he wishes to persuade real scholars--that would be much too ambitious a task.

0425263908|1.0|I'm just a blown away as the other reviewers at how much it resembles fifty shades of grey. I absolutely loved fifty shades and I find it offensive that someone would try and copy the story. I read half the book, trying not to hate it, and finally put it down and walked away. Don't read it unless you want to read about characters trying to be like Christian and Ana

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Just a quick background, I am not a huge comic book fan. I do enjoy the Batman movies but I really dont have any idea how close the movies are to the comic books. That being said, I went into The Avengers with little regard as to who they were, but now Im obsessed. Ive seen the movie 4 times and it just gets better and better. The acting is great, everyones favorite character typically ends up being the hulk by the end of the movie, and for good reason. Hes a scene stealer. Honestly, If you arnt a big superhero fan give this movie a try, Its actually quite amazing.

B005HI7NP0|5.0|Singer Betty Wright has one of the most interesting careers in music. She originally started out singing gospel music and later switched to doing R&B in the late 1960's- all before she was old enough to vote. By the time the 70's rolled around, she was making a name for herself with her series of signature songs. In that decade, she recorded the now classic songs \\"Clean Up Woman\\" as well as \\"Tonight's The Night\\". Also, she discoved such talents as George McRae and disco singer Peter Brown. As the 80's began, Betty seemed to falter in her career. That all changed in the late 80's when she released the comeback singles \\"No Pain No Gain\\" and \\"After The Pain\\" from her album \\"Mother Wit\\". She released a few more albums in the next few years and founs herself doing some session work behind the scenes as well. She was responsible for conducting the choir on Gloria Estefan's song \\"Coming Out Of The Dark\\" as well as on Trick Daddy's \\"I'm A Thug\\". She also appeared on Joss Stone's albums \\"The Soul Sessions\\" and \\"Mind, Body & Soul\\". After a ten year hiatus from recording, Wright would resurface with a new album.<br /><br />2011 saw the release of her new studio album, \\"Betty Wright: The Movie\\". She gets help from The Roots, as they are the house band for the duration of the album with drummer Ahmir \\"?uestlove\\" Thompson serving as the record's producer. She gets help from a couple of old friends on here- such as Joss Stone on \\"Whisper In The Wind\\". She also lands a duet with Tower Of Power singer Lenny Williams on \\"Baby Come Back\\"- complete with the same exact rhythm arrangement as The Roots' song \\"OtherSide\\" from their \\"Undun\\" album (which was released just mere weeks after this album). She gets assistance from Lil' Wayne on the first single \\"Grapes On A Vine\\" and Snoop Dogg on \\"Real Woman\\". She advises mena and women on how to make a relationship work on \\"In The Middle Of The Game (Don't Change The Play)\\". On the song \\"Hollywould\\", she sings a somber tale of a woman out of control with an appearance from newcomer Robert \\"The Messenger\\" Bozeman. She confronts a man to right the wrongs in his marriage on \\"Look Around (Be A Man)\\" and sings about the influence of classic R&B on \\"Old Songs\\". Overall, \\"Betty Wright: The Movie\\" is an outstanding album from the legendary and unsung vocalist. This is an album that shows that she still has it in her to make timeless music.ntrol with an appearance from newcomer Robert \\"The Messenger\\" Bozeman.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Okay, if you're on the Amazon page for this movie, chances are you've already seen plenty of five star reviews.  At this point it feels like all I can say has been said before. Is the movie good? Absolutely! Not only is it one of the best movies of the year, but one of the best comic book movies ever made. The cast is great all around, the action is amazing and the movie is just simply a lot of fun. It holds up as well on home video as it did in the cinemas.<br /><br />What is there really to say beyond that? The Blu-ray looks beautiful. The picture is one of the best I've seen (and I have a fairly large Blu-ray collection). In terms of special features: the commentary is insightful and often funny.  The gag reel has some pretty funny moments, but feels a little short. The One-Shot short film that Marvel generally includes on the Blu-rays is pretty fun, as per usual.<br /><br />All around this is one of the most enjoyable movies of the year. If you have a Blu-ray player and even a passing interest in comic books, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.

They've always been wrapped in mystery and intrigue as to be almost mythical beings.  Now we've been educated as to what great men & heros they truly are. Know that this book is much more than the story of OBL's death.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Mohanda Gandhi, often known as \\"Mahatma Gandhi,\\" because he was an holy individual regarded with a lot reverence and respect from the Indian nation.  His focus was to Indian-nationalism in a British ruled India, by non-violent civil independence actions, leading India to their independence.  As Gandhi's actions took place in India, all over the world countries and individuals were inspired by his non-violence approach to civil rights and freedom.  Before he began to fight for the freedoms and rights of his Indian home, he fought for those things in South Africa for the Hindu and Muslim faiths. To my surprise, he reached out to several religious congregations - Christianity, Hindu, Muslim; alike.  Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, increasing economic self-reliance, and above all for achieving Swaraj--the independence of India from British domination (Wikipedia).  He continued his non-violent approach to life in every aspect, until he died at the age of 79 in 1948 by being shot on his way to church by Nathuram Godse. This young man held Gandhi accountable weakening India.  In Hindu tradition, ashes are to be spread in to a river. Gandhi's were rashioned across India to be used in memorial services, but most of his ashes - which you saw at the end of the film - where they spread his ashes in the river of Sangam at Allahabad.<br />Gandhi's approach to life was inspirational and admirable. I absolutely loved watching how he did not partake in violence no matter what physical, mental, or verbal abuse he was exposed to. And all of his followers committed their lives to behaving in the same way.  I was absolutely astonished at the scene where women prepared \\"aiding stations\\" beside where several men would walk by rows of six towards British ruled authority figures and were beaten row by row, but didn't fight back. This brought respect from me to Gandhi as a heroic individual and to the Hinduism religion and the way they approach life and their people.<br />Great movie! I would recommend it to anyone! :) Especially those of other faiths!<br /><br />- Jordan
B009DP9D6A|4.0|Holistic Overview:<br /><br />After spinning the CD >album title goes here&lt;, I noticed it has the distinguishable \\"Deadmau5\\" sound throughout the first portion, but the execution is definitely different from his previous work for better or for worse. Overall, it is a very distinct album by him but is definitely not what comes to mind when fans think of Deadmau5. Fans may bicker about how good (or bad) this album may be, but it is  worth a listen. There will be parts or songs that everyone is sure to enjoy but equally as much, there will others where everyone will not. I give 4 stars instead of 5 because I know there are other albums of his that rank better but it is not simply a 3 star because it still has many redeeming qualities. New listeners to Deadmau5 should be advised to pick up one of his other albums before giving this one a listen but I encourage fans to give this album a few spins before jumping to any conclusions.<br /><br />Detailed Overview:<br /><br />Transitions:<br />The most noticeable aspect of the whole album which may bother some electronic enthusiasts is the lack of transitions between each song. Personally, one of the best parts about electronic music are the seamless and elegant transitions between songs, none of which this album has to offer- each song is stand alone. However this does not mean that the order does not matter; similar songs are set back to back against one another and complement each other well.<br /><br />Buildups:<br />For the majority of the songs, the beginning of each has a fairly slow buildup and depending on the song, either has a rewarding or disappointing drop. Comparatively to his previous albums, this one is a bit slow and is not meant for the impatient but given the time, I think the buildups are a distinct part of this album.<br /><br />Split in the album-<br /><br />Part 1:<br />This half and then some of the album is what you might typically expect to hear when someone mentions Deadmau5 and mimics a bit of 4x4=12. Closer and October are extremely similar to Strobe so anybody who enjoys the latter should definitely give the former two a listen.<br /><br />Part 2:<br />However, during the song Sleepless, the whole album takes a fairly drastic (and non-Deadmau5) turn. The return of the voice from \\"Some times things get complicated\\" or the Stephan Hawking voice, comes up in Sleepless. The song in particular sounds nothing like Deadmau5 and instead would be expected in the lounge of a hotel or even the background of the menu to a video game. The next two songs are equally as eccentric. I'm no expert in hip hop but Failbait featuring Cypress Hill sounds as if it came straight out of one of his own albums with very few elements of Deadmau5 to accompany it. Similarly, Telemiscommunication featuring Imogen Heap sounds as if the track came off one of her own albums as well. More or less while the album still has that distinguishable Deadmau5 sound, this last portion sounds little to nothing like him.12.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I'll let the more technical/astute fans give their reviews and I love them all but this is a purely EMOTIONAL review.  Have not listened to the Beach Boys recently but when I heard their latest CD - I got this feeling in the pit of my stomach and my eyes teared up.  Brought back so many memories of the Sixties and OH, THE BEAUTIFUL HARMONY - LIKE NO OTHER.  Brian Wilson is such a genius and it's a shame that his lifestyle in the early years took its toll. I saw him on a talk show recently and the effects of all that abuse were both  evident and sad.  Quite paradoxically, NONE of that has hindered his ability to create beautiful music.  I can always pick out his beautiful high pitched voice in any BB song -and hands down- his music and song writing skills are UNPARALLELED.....  In my very humble opinion and as a child growing up in the 60's- There really hasn't been a lot of music like this since the Beach Boys - Thank you from the bottom of my heart - Long Live The Beach Boys!
B000003N89|5.0|This gal can definitely put the moves on great tunes and she exemplifies this fact in this CD. I missed this when it came out as I have several of Diana's albums. She really can play and wraps the tunes around her voice like a svengali doing a number on the audience. You have to pay attention to this artist when she performs and she is wonderful at what she does. Very nice combination of songs on this CD.
0345803485|3.0|Not quite sure why this book is so popular.  Christian, the male love interest, is a controlling sadist.  The female love interest, Anastasia, is a naïve, recent college grad that is totally taken advantage of by Christian.  Very unappealing.  James tells a good story that kept me turning the pages, but the response of Anastasia was unconvincing.  It made reading the book feeling like trying not to stare at a car wreck.

B0036EH3WK|4.0|LOST is a pioneer in so many things. It has a movie quality production value, amazingly written with some of the most enduring characters in TV series history and the twists and turns keep you guessing. There is continuity and progression of narratives and character developments that are often lacking in other lenghty syndication.<br /><br />The mythology is full of puzzles and it's fun to explore and theorize what is what, or when events actually occurred. Unlike The X-Files, another favourite show, LOST myths enrich and move the main stories forward. It never loses its focus on the characters and the completion of the characters self-discoveries.<br /><br />Whilst Season 2 & 3 are mired by some lackluster episodes and characters, the rest of the show is pure mint.<br /><br />In hindsight however, this show could've benefited from perhaps another season, in order to develop the new characters intoduced late in the series. Season 6 for example, at times felt rushed with some plot devices never explained, while a few characters are simply killed off without any flashbacks to their past nor further character development. I'd have loved to delve further into characters like Charlotte, Daniel and Miles. The show writers hinted at Charlotte Lewis being a central figure that might unveil the mysteries behind the island's ancient civilisations, but this was never explored at all in the end. Another character, Ilana, seems to have a connection with Jacob and the Taweret statue. But again that trail led to another shocking dead end.<br /><br />An episode about who put the Egyptian hieroglyphs or built the Temple would be nice. Better still, how about giving us some clues about what is the deal with the Heart of the Island or the Sumerian pictographs on the Cork. That would've been better explained rather than leaving them as red herrings or another production error.<br /><br />The box set itself is a nifty representation of the show, with gimmicks and surprises that reward fans. A top notch package design with excellent print quality and even a hidden bonus disc. Kudos to the designers.<br /><br />So all in all here's a salute to Lindelof, Cuse, Abrams and their team of directors and writers for giving us this amalgamation of genres with care and attention to details: sci-fi, mysteries, ancient civilizations, faith vs science, fate vs free will, conspiracies and many more.<br /><br />This review is missing a star because Season 3 & 4 are not multi region coded. ABC should've really stood up for its name sake and allow access for region A, B & C. If you are a fan, get this set.ans.

B008PZ69RU|3.0|\\"A wise man once said if there's a fork in the road take it.\\" This is a<br />movie that deals with many different characters from different parts of<br />the world from different social classes and how they deal with day to<br />day problems from doing anything to earn money to getting stranded<br />while traveling. The cast in this, which includes: Rachel Weisz, Jude<br />Law, Anthony Hopkins and Ben Foster is great and honestly the cast is<br />the best part of the movie. I used to think that a great cast<br />automatically means that it will be a great movie, but after the last 4<br />or 5 movies I have seen based off the cast I am beginning to rethink my<br />opinion. The acting is great in this and the story lines basically end<br />up being tied together I guess but the movie is just so slow moving<br />that it makes it really hard to stay interested in. The movie is pretty<br />OK but for me this is another example of a great cast in a sub-par<br />movie. Overall, very slow moving drama that is really only worth seeing<br />because of the cast. I give it a C+.

B005LAII6M|1.0|Oddly, in one weekend, I watched new films from Paul Thomas Anderson (\\"The Master\\", \\"There Will Be Blood\\", \\"Magnolia\\") and Paul W.S. Anderson (\\"Resident Evil 1, 4 & 5\\", \\"Death Race\\", \\"Aliens Vs. Predator\\", \\"The Three Musketeers\\"). At one point, Paul W.S. added the 'W.S.' because he was \\"tired of having to explain the significance of the frogs falling from the sky\\" in \\"Magnolia\\". Whoever made that mistake wasn't very observant.<br /><br />It is easy to identify a film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson; strange involving stories filled with amazing performances in beautifully crafted films.<br /><br />It is just as easy to identify a film directed by Paul W.S. Anderson; stories adapted from video games or made to look like video games, filled with wooden performances from extremely pretty former models (male and female) in films filled with explosions, gore and computer-generated effects. And the films usually contain the latest, most wooden performance from Milla Jovovich, the director's wife.<br /><br />Paul W.S. Anderson should be happy for the mistaken identity. If I were the perpetrator of as much garbage as W.S., I would be happy to be mistaken for a true artist.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" is a terrible, terrible film. None of the sequels in this series have a beginning or end and there is never any suspense. There can't be any suspense because you know Alice, Jovovich's character, will never die. In fact, she can't die. So no matter how many armed men, how many mutant CGI dogs, how many flesh cutting lasers the director throws at her, you know she will never die. The only thing that will kill Alice is if people stop going to these films, if they stop renting them, if they stop downloading them. Only then, will \\"Resident Evil\\" end.<br /><br />Because the films are based on a video game, Anderson seems content to keep the narrative as simple as possible. And the films ultimately play into this formula. In each, Alice has to get from point A to point B, while maneuvering a number of obstacles. In other words, she has to get from Level A to Level B, exactly the same goal of playing most video games. This narrative formula can never change and it will never allow for a beginning or end. Because everything in these films is \\"middle\\", the narrative has an enhanced unpleasant, unsettling effect. It doesn't help the viewer become grounded in all of the violence, mayhem and carnage.<br /><br />Despite the change in settings, the only other thing that changes is the people around Annie. These characters can die, and most of them do, but even some of the fallen come back to life in slightly altered form. How is this possible? The Umbrella Organization, the unimaginatively named evil group controlling everything in Alice's universe, wants to mess with Alice's mind. Ali Larter (TV's \\"Heroes\\"), Wentworth Miller (TV's \\"Prison Break\\"), Oded Fehr (\\"The Mummy\\", TV's \\"Covert Affairs\\"), Boris Kodjoe and many others have served alongside Annie at one point or another before getting killed.<br /><br />\\"Retribution\\" picks up before installment #4 ends. The last scene of that film is replayed twice in #5, both forward and backward. I'm not exactly sure why this was done, but Anderson clearly thinks he has some cool special effects to show off, so we watch the scene play in reverse, in slow motion, and then watch the scene again as it plays forward. A few minutes later, Alice revisits the Tokyo intersection she spent some time at in number 4. Again, not sure why we have to spend time in this place again, but both of these instances point to a filmmaker who is running short on ideas.<br /><br />When the film actually begins moving forward, Alice is suddenly shielding her 'daughter', protecting her from suburban zombies. Eventually, Alice meets up with a group of men who will try to help her get to an abandoned Russian submarine base. They feel they can take one of the subs and find safety. Boris Kodjoe, Johann Urb, Bingbing Li, Oded Fehr and Michelle Rodriquez all join the fun as various targets for the armed militia employed by the Umbrella Organization.<br /><br />If you press me, the only positive I can comment on is that each film seems to assemble a multi-ethnic cast of pretty people as supporting characters. Unfortunately, most of these are killed off one-by-one.<br /><br />Why a Russian submarine? Not sure.<br /><br />In #4, Alice was invincible because she was injected with a serum that bonded with her genes and made her impervious. At the end of the film, these powers were taken away. This is an important illustration of what I was referring to earlier. There can be no suspense in these films, because Alice is never hurt. If the powers that make her invincible can't change this, what will? Also, it seems like a bit of a cheat for the filmmakers to do one thing and then change it back again. The filmmakers are creating this world, they are setting the rules.  When they change the rules they have created, they cheat the viewer and telegraph their own lack of creativity. Who knows they may even change this back again for #6.<br /><br />I guess we really shouldn't expect even good acting in a film like this, the fourth sequel of a movie based on a video game, or in a film directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (even Joan Allen and Ian MacShane couldn't transcend \\"Death Race\\"), but it is mind-numbingly bad. Jovovich looks like she is saying her lines phonetically and doesn't do anything but shout or grimace. The rest of the cast is negligible. The males, presumably tough guys, grimace a lot and glare. Michelle Rodriguez, the toughest of the group, manages to grimace in a slightly different way, at times, giving her more of a range. Wouldn't it be a surprise is one of these films actually contained a single performance that could qualify as acting?<br /><br />\\"Retribution\\" ends with a scene setting up the next inevitable installment. Really, folks. The only way this series will ever end is if we don't buy another ticket, pay for another download, rent another DVD. These movies are not good and really have no redeeming value, so this should be a fairly easy goal.<br /><br />Come on.

B005XN31LY|5.0|I downloaded Amazon Instant Video and purchased the first season of OUAT and love both! The video viewer has great functionality, is easy to navigate, and just \\"makes sense\\". I got through season one of Once Upon A Time in less than a week...watched up to four episodes a night - just couldn't put it down! Season two is almost here... I can't wait!
B008220DGE|3.0|Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) walks up to and touches a large picture window - \\"I see grass\\" - and then walks to the other side of the room and touches a wood-paneled wall - \\"I see lumber\\". Back and forth. Back and forth. Repeatedly as Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), his wife, Peggy (Amy Adams) and their many followers watch. This is one of Dodd's, aka \\"The Master\\" of a new religious movement called \\"The Cause\\", methods of achieving a 'breakthrough'. But Quell is literally and figuratively hitting his head against the wall.<br /><br />And this is a good analogy for how I felt after watching Paul Thomas Anderson's new film \\"The Master\\". I felt like I was hitting my head against the wall.<br /><br />I am a huge admirer of Anderson's films. \\"Magnolia\\" and \\"There Will Be Blood\\" are two of my favorite films. \\"Punch Drunk Love\\" remains the best and only watchable Adam Sandler film. \\"Boogie Nights\\" is a great film containing some of the best performances of many of the actor's careers.<br /><br />I also admire his films because he is one of a small handful of directors who make films they want to make in the way they want to make them. A three hour-plus look at the intersecting lives of people in the San Fernando Valley? Most studios would laugh in the director's face and slam the door behind them. A film about a turn-of-the-century oil prospector and the first section of the film will have no dialogue? Get out of here. Anderson is one of the few directors who can pull this off. He has only made six films in sixteen years and he tells complex, interesting and unusual stories in exactly the way he envisions.<br /><br />Anderson is one of a handful of directors who seem to have complete control over their films. The film opened a week early in two theaters in Los Angeles and a few theaters in New York. Because he shot the film in 70mm, he requested the film be shown in 70mm and 35mm in addition to the now prevalent Digital Projection. The theaters agreed because they know he goes to such great pains to compose his films, and that their clientele would probably want to see the film in 70mm. But really, how often do you hear of a director doing this? More important, how many studios and theaters would agree to the extra cost? When the film eventually rolls out to theaters across the country, it will inevitably play in shoebox theaters, but it is an indication of the passion of the director that he is willing and able to make such a request. It is a sign of the respect he has earned that such a request is honored.<br /><br />Because he makes each film with such care, and makes so few films, each new story arrives with a lot of anticipation attached. Buzz has been circulating about his newest film \\"The Master\\" almost from the moment it was announced. \\"It is a biography of L. Ron Hubbard, the former science fiction pulp writer who founded Scientology, the home to Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley and many other Hollywood stars.\\" \\"It is a critique of Scientology, looking at the early days of the movement.\\" \\"It isn't a critique of Scientology.\\" \\"It has nothing to do with Scientology.\\" \\"It isn't about L. Ron Hubbard.\\" And so on.<br /><br />All of these arguments and comments evaporated when Anderson screened the film for Cruise, to get his input and/ or approval. The film does seem like a pretty transparent look at L. Ron Hubbard and the early days of Scientology.<br /><br />But \\"The Master\\" does not reach the same heights as his previous films. And that's a shame, because it has a lot of good things going for it.<br /><br />The production design, the sound design, the performances of the two leads, all great.<br /><br />I would call Anderson an artist, despite this small misstep. He crafts every frame of his films with such exacting detail that you can't help but be transported to the time and place depicted. \\"Master\\" opens with a brief segment depicting Freddie's service in the Navy during the last days of World War II. The scenes show the men trying to stave off boredom and getting into mischief. And they give us a glimpse at the lengths Freddy will go to get buzzed on alcohol. These moments, influenced by Terrence Malick's \\"The Thin Red Line\\", are strangely beautiful in their depiction of the war; they almost seem like they could be pulled from a hyper-realistic revival of \\"South Pacific\\". When the story returns stateside, Freddy gets a job at a department store and you have no doubt the film is set in the 50s. Anderson recreates a grand old store (like an old Bullocks) with such beauty, it makes you feel as though you are actually walking through it. A beautiful yacht, a Manhattan socialite's apartment, a large home, a seedy storefront in Phoenix, each new setting adds to the rich look of the film.<br /><br />Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood composed the music for this film, as he did with \\"There Will Be Blood\\", and it is an unusual score adding a lot of the texture to the film. As Freddie tries to stave off boredom in the Navy, he pounds on a coconut, trying to get it open. These sounds join other bits of ambient noise to become part of the score, creating a music that seems unusual, yet unobtrusive because the sounds are coming from real life. Much like the old Warner Bros. cartoons when the characters would create an 'Anvil Chorus'. Greenwood continues this throughout. It is refreshing in a way, because it is so different from a Hans Zimmer, a Danny Elfman and most definitely very different from a John Williams score. Different in a good way because even my appreciation of Zimmer's and Elfman's work is waning because everything they do sounds so similar.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix is almost mercurial as Freddie Quell, the disillusioned serviceman who returns home feeling out of place. Drinking whatever form of alcohol he can get his hands on, he roams from job to job, while losing what little social standing he has, until he wanders onto a yacht being used by Lancaster Dodd for his daughter's wedding. He wakes up the next morning, confronted by Dodd. Apparently, before he passed out, Freddie whipped up a batch of hooch and Dodd is eager for more. Quell seems to find a peace Dodd's words and thoughts and eagerly follows him from stop to stop. In fact, he becomes so enamored of Dodd, he willingly engages anyone who criticizes the new movement in a fist fight.<br /><br />Phoenix's performance shouldn't work, but somehow he pulls it off. Theatrical and over-the-top, Freddie is full of grand gestures and shouts, but Phoenix also embellishes the character with tics and doubt, filtering the grander aspects of his character into something more human. And much more troubled. Freddie Quell is a man who has never lived with much guidance and now that the war is over, he finds himself drifting through life trying to find the next drunken binge. And when he finds Dodd, he also finds one more addiction to feed his lonely life.<br /><br />\\"I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a theoretical philosopher, but above all, I am a man, just like you.\\" There are few actors who could utter this line of dialogue and make us believe it. Thankfully, Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Lancaster Dodd, a former Science Fiction pulp writer who is slowly building a new religion. When he utters this line, you might expect yourself to laugh, but Hoffman is amazingly believable in the role. You believe in his conviction, in his strength, in his disappointment at criticism. He can see this religion so clearly, why can't every one else?<br /><br />When Dodd actually conducts some of the exercises he uses, I couldn't help but stare rapt at the screen. Hoffman's mostly calm, measured performance makes Dodd seem more real and believable. And when he gets upset, these moments simply round out the performance. The character really comes together when Dodd's group visits the apartment of a Manhattan socialite. She has arranged a party, full of wealthy people eager and willing to experience the Cause. Dodd and his entourage arrive and mingle. Later, Dodd begins to lead a woman through \\"Processing\\", the other party guests watching with rapt attention. A man stands to one side watching. As Dodd begins walking the women through the exercise, the man begins to interrupt. But Dodd doesn't acknowledge him and continues. The man interrupts a few times and each time Dodd ignores him. Finally, he can longer be ignored and Dodd angrily turns to him, listening to his criticisms and then answers back. As the story continues, we see Dodd demonstrate different aspects of his new religion and defend it against various attacks. And throughout, Hoffman brings a fine, modulated intensity to the role.<br /><br />If Phoenix is the showier of the two actors, he is perfectly complimented by Hoffman's more restrained, but also volatile performance.<br /><br />Amy Adams is also good as Peggy, Dodd's pregnant wife and most ardent supporter. She quietly stands in the background, always smiling, until she sees the effect Quell is having on Dodd and The Cause. Later, she reveals the level and intensity of her power, making her a suddenly much more interesting character.<br /><br />Even with all of these good things, the film is still missing something, something to tie it all together, to make the film as a whole work.<br /><br />Throughout, we see various degrees of Freddie's erratic behavior. But we never see what he is like in a normal state, or at least, a more normal state. From the beginning, he is bored, restless and on the hunt for the next binge. While it is interesting to watch such an all-consuming portrayal of a man's downward spiral, without some indication of where he started out the journey becomes unanchored and problematic. Freddie doesn't have the roundness of Anderson's other leads. An argument could be made that Freddie's days with the Navy are the beginning, but he is already acting so immature, so at ease, there has to be an earlier beginning which we don't have the opportunity to witness.<br /><br />The reason for Dodd's infatuation with Freddie is also lost on me. From the moment they meet, Dodd seems to feed off something within the drunk, lost soul of his new prot&eacute;g&eacute;. And while Freddie wholeheartedly embraces the ideals of The Cause, he seems to have difficulty actually living by these new ideals. Dodd views his new prot&eacute;g&eacute; as a project, someone he can make better and use as a poster child for his new movement. But Freddie never really improves, so why does Dodd remain infatuated? Peggy even question's her husband's devotion to Freddie.<br /><br />There are a few very brief moments when we begin to get a picture of Dodd's thought processes behind The Cause. But these moments are way too brief and aren't hard hitting or insightful enough to offer any sort of comment, critique or insight into the reasons behind this new religion.<br /><br />And when \\"The Master\\" is done, you still have questions. You still want more. You still need more to connect all the dots.<br /><br />And this has never happened during a Paul Thomas Anderson film before.daughter's wedding.

057809665X|2.0|I was very disappointed.  I purchased the book based on the reviews, but apparently they were reading a different book.  Both the writing and the editing need work and the book would benefit from serious proofreading.  I found the writing style rambling often digressing in the middle of a story to tell another story.  It read more like a stream of consciousness.  I was serious thinking of trashing it be the end of the introduction, but I hoped the techniques would be worth the read.  In-spite of the faults, I  read the book for the techniques, which were poorly described and very basic.  The book reminded me of the ones professional speakers write so they can say they have written a book. In short, if I had it to do over, I would keep my money.

I will never read another novel by this author or spend my time entwined.  She is obviously \\"green\\" and needs to learn how to end a fabulous story.  I consider what others may have done with this to create a fabulous ending.  So disappointing, again. Don't bother.
B003XU02QG|1.0|Bad movies are well..bad movies.  Some are so bad they are great fun to watch, this one could have been somewhat interesting, a few hot looking Hollywood types, a great Russian star Olga Kurylenko, some snow, some unwashed hordes and a bunch of Romans, seemed like great start. Sadly the film goes nowhere and the fight scenes contain some of the worst special effects and blood work I have ever seen.  In a headlong rush to get to the end, the film forgets all logic, characters development and relies on endless cliches and ridiculous plot elements.<br /><br />If you like Rome, the HBO series by the same name is a way better bet or Gladiator.<br /><br />This is a total pass.....

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I hate to say this but I am now a \\"Wooler\\". I have to say when I downloaded the First book of \\"Wool\\" on it's own (as this is a 5 Part series) I was hooked within a few pages which is not usual that soon in. The character development was excellent as was the plot as it formed and I was glued to the mini-novelette. When I came to the end of the 1st book, I HAD to get the other books right away (so buy the OMNIBUS version with all the WOOL books).<br /><br />This book has everything: drama, love, friendship, murder, secrets, intrigue, science fiction, twists and turns and a shocking ending to boot. I don't write out a lot of reviews on the books I download but this one so deserves the credit. I am grateful that Hugh Howey wanted to share a story so grand and entrancing, that it would have been a crime not to share this with the world. This is destined to be a classic as most of the other 1851 reviewer have stated.<br /><br />I am just thankful I saw a highlight on the Amazon Conference about this book and took a chance on it. I will be letting my friends, fans and followers about this great new Classic.<br /><br />Thank you Hugh. Can't wait to read First Shift. You have a \\"Wooler\\" for life. ;)

B0066W1AZK|2.0|The two good things about Chess Free are: 1) It's capable of playing chess very well; and 2) The program's skill level is very adjustable.<br /><br />However, there are aspects of the interface I don't care for, beginning most importantly with the board graphics. I don't know why chess computer game makers feel compelled to render boards and pieces to look 3-D, but the result is never as clear as plain old 2-D diagrams. (I just noticed Chess Free's logo. The knight and rook in its logo, which are 2-D representations with just a touch of 3-D rendering, are much easier on the eye than the full 3-D pieces in the actual software!) Secondly, there's no list of moves played, nor any other way for the human to know what the software's last move was.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is incredible, love it just as much as the last.  Definitely pick up the Deluxe edition it's worth it.
B004T4KKSA|4.0|The author tells a great story while simultaneously informing why the hydrocarbon market is the way it is today.  Demonstrates just how relevant hydrocarbons are for the future.  Also dismisses some myths about the market.
B006GLLXXK|5.0|Season 1 of True Blood is so addicting.  Love this show and am forever hooked.  Amazon is awesome instant video is awesome, I'm so glad they have this show in HD.  The picture quality was wonderful, no pauses and loaded up right away.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|Vonnegut is a highly praised writer, and this book most succinctly shows why. His casual yet excellent prose keeps you in the action of the plot, but he never loses the cynical edge that makes his writing fresh. The final plot twist seems anti-climatic, but when you realize that that was his whole purpose the book really takes on new meaning.
B008PE9GSA|1.0|The sound quality is atrocious. Mescalero was bad but this is a LOT worse in terms of being a \\"loudness war\\" casualty.<br /><br />The songs are mundane at best.<br /><br />Recycled riffs and lacking in any real smarts or standout melodies.<br /><br />Rhythmeen was their last better-than-average album, I don't see many of these songs making any real lasting impressions in a live environment either.<br /><br />Just found out they are playing ONE song form this album on their current tour. They must be so proud of this album !<br /><br />Contrast to someone who HASN''T thrown in the creative towel like Rush, who are playing NINE songs from their latest album on their current tour.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|This movie has the most action out of all of them so far [not including the 2nd half of the 4th movie, which isn't out yet]. The story continues where the 2nd movie left off and it goes through the fight between Victoria and Bella. Sure, the actual fight is a little fake looking but it still looks awesome and is a great movie.
B000002KIQ|5.0|I am not a fan of Ry Cooder but a friend of mine is.  I picked this particular album because I LOVE JAZZ and I'm happy to say that he loves this album as well.  It turned out to be a very good birthday for him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Did remind me of Battle Royal. But there okay. Collins expressed the theme beautifully. Can't wait to read the other books.
B00005JMX6|5.0|This movie is interesting because it is about two different subjects at once.  It starts out that a porn star moves into a neighborhood to house sit next door to a high school boy.  This boy falls in love with this girl before finding out of her past.  A man from the industry shows up and forces her to go back with him to make another porn movie.  When this boy finds out, he takes off after her.  There is a large amount of money involved here.  The boys agree to make their own porn type movie using her friends from the industry.  After they make the movie, this man threatens to show it to his parents if he doesn't pay him money.  The boy tells him to go ahead and show the movie.  What is cool about this is that the boys have made a sex education movie showing real girls and boys to be shown in schools. They use real nudity and instructions on how to use a condom on a real boy.  This is very funny when they show the movie in his school.  This porn girl has also fallen in love with the neighbor next door also.  The rest is history as they say.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to those who don't mind a little nudity.  Also, the story is very good.  You won't be disappointed.  Also, be sure to buy the unrated version of this movie.
B00992CF6W|3.0|When I bought it I was expecting the full game with the end, endermen, and redstone. it is still great for practice for building though.
0385344333|1.0|I was really enjoying this book as I have many Reacher books, and then Child wrapped it up like he had to go to the bathroom and he wanted to finish the book before he did.  The conclusion was awful. I'm very disappointed with my expenditure
B00407PNY2|5.0|Steve McQueen is a movie icon. This is a good movie with cool cars and one of the best chase scenes on film.
B007USWD0U|5.0|A great transfer that really keeps the analogue film effect (grain) giving the presentation life and emotion. To tell the truth, viewing it on bluray was better than in my local cinema showing the film in digital form. Way to go CC!
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|This was one of the better movies that year. Watch it, you'll like it. I got a brand new DVD at a good price.
B008IZ5X5Q|5.0|Dexter Season 6 continues to keep you on the edge. Excellent writing and of course acting. I cannot understand the lack of Emmy nods for this show.<br />This season utilized underlying biblical messages and how Dexter embraced and twisted it was true to form. Colin Hanks was excellent as a guest star; it certainly is in his genes. Mos Def was compelling as Brother Sam. The only drawback was the direction they took Detective Quinn in the series. It became annoying to the point of ridiculous each time he screwed up. Sergeant Batista is underutilized and hopefully will be more prominent next season.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|A good flick based on a real cop. Al Pacino does a great job, but when doesn't he? You'll like it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This gentleman did a wonderful job with this story. He gave solid background and kept it interesting without revealing anything the public has no need to know. I thank him for stepping up to tell the truth about what happened on this mission. Enough with the political junk we're being fed about it. Thank you, sir, for your service.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Omnibus Edition, a collection of the first five books in the Wool Series, written by Hugh Howey, is a truly impressive post apocalyptic science fiction saga. The Wool Series vividly describes the detailed inner workings of a society that has been living in a massive underground survival shelter called a \\"silo\\" for hundreds of years. Every conceivable detail has been considered in the construction of this fictional underground civilization that was created to sustain human life after some unfathomable cataclysmic event. Intricate human relationships develop within the massive 140 floor underground silo that is mostly self-sufficient as though it were some deep space colony. Indeed, the surface of the Earth has been made so inhospitable that it might as well be another planet. The detail and consideration that went into this silo is almost unimaginable. Even the physical features of the silo were designed deliberately to impede communication and cooperation among the residents. The truth is deliberately concealed from the general population as if it was a virus that would destroy the fragile remnants of civilization. So much thought, planning and effort has been made to keep the truth hidden from the general population, supposedly for their own good. Like other great science fiction, Wool explores the idea of how a new discovery might impact the delicately constructed framework of human reality. Hugh Howey deserves a great deal of credit for the thought and imagination that he poured into the incredibly intelligent story that is destined to become a science fiction classic. Remarkable in its breadth and scope, it is certain that Wool will leave a lasting impression in your mind.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an absorbing read. The theme is strikingly original and is incredibly detailed and sustained throughout. Suspense and conflict make this a real page turner. If I may be allowed a minor criticism is that there is no lighter touch or humor anywhere. This is nevertheless worthy of five stars and is an epic in its own right.
0345803485|1.0|I cannot believe how stupid this book is and yet it is at the top of the best-seller books.  I blame myself for wasting my money and buying something this stupid.  Like others,  I was caught up in the hype about the book and was just curious. I have read almost all of the book and was hoping that may be something substantial would appear in the story. However, I  found out that there is no substance, there is nothing believable in the story and it is just a repetition of the same thing over and over.  It is so childish that I feel embarrassed to say that I have read it.  I really blame the media for all the hype for a book like this.  There are so many good and respectable books out there and we never hear about them and then a trash like this gets so much attention and makes the author to be an un-deserved millionaire.  What can I say, we live in an era that Kardashian's become household names and millionaire.  How much lower are we getting as a society?<br />Please don't waste your money for this book!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|THIS BOOK KEEPS YOU READING...NOT WANTING TO PUT IT DOWN.....ALWAYS WANTING TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT........... HAS A GREAT PLOT.
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|John Carter is a fun sci-movie that has lots of action.  It is a great family movie for all to watch. If you like special effects this one has a few.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A great imaginitive story.  If you are looking for a story to get lost in this is it.  The nostalgia of the 1950s and 1960s comes to life in this easy to read page turner.  If blood and gore scare you off of most Steven King books, you will not find it in this one, this is not a typical Steven King story, which goes to show you what a great writer he really is.

B0053XM7ZU|4.0|Once again another must if reading the Game of Thrones series. George R.R. Martin has a way of writing to keep you reading, chapter after chapter so you have to find out what will happen. Can't wait to read all the books and continue with the stories.
B009B50QOU|3.0|So it's 1994, and your major label debut, \\"Dookie,\\" just made you the biggest act around. you put out a few more albums that do well enough, but never recapture that initial success. Your time in the limelight has passed, the world has moved onto the next big thing...<br /><br />And then, out of nowhere, the unheard of happens. You put out \\"American Idiot\\", a good ten years after what was supposed to be your biggest time of success, and it launches you right back into the spotlight. Suddenly you aren't just writing modern rock hits. These are Hot 100 chart toppers. Your band finally escaped the shadow of your major label debut. You've proven to the world that you're here to stay...but how the heck are you gonna follow it up?<br /><br />Ever since \\"American Idiot\\" swept the nation, Green Day has been very strategic about where to take their career. \\"21st Century Breakdown\\" was an attempt to do a bigger, better \\"American Idiot.\\" Now three years later, what in God's name can the band do? A return to the early 90's punk? A third rock opera? Something brand new? The answer ended up being ALL OF THE ABOVE. Green Day announced three new records; one power-pop, one garage rock, and one epic.<br /><br />The first of three records is called UNO, which is a power pop record infused with punk energy. Don't listen to the reviewers that are calling this a return to Dookie's sound. This record fits in with the late 90's and pre-idiot Green Day output. If I had to sum it up, I'd say it sounds like a harder version of 2000's \\"Warning.\\"<br /><br />The songs themselves are a mixed bag. There are some true highlights here, but they're unfortunately surrounded by mediocre songs that probably never would have seen the light of day had the whole \\"3 albums in 4 months\\" concept never happened...<br /><br />Which brings me to my final, and probably most important point. Is it fair to review this album yet? Standing alone, it's an average Green Day record with a few fantastic moments. As partof the trilogy, it may very well take on a whole new meaning. The true review of \\"Uno! Dos! Tre!\\" Won't exist until they're all out. For the time being, we've got UNO! to enjoy for what it is; a fun, up-tempo power-pop album that doesn't take itself too seriously.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|This 4th book in the Game of Thrones series is a wonderful continuation of a series that keeps you reading, with twists and turns that have you guessing at what is going to happen next, even when you think you have it all sorted. A really good read for all fantasy readers.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was nice seeing what the life and progression of a Navy Seal is.  It showed incredible dedication to service.  It takes a special breed to embark on the life of a Navy Seal.
1847879071|4.0|What can you really say about a textbook? This one, though, is written in a light way that may be exactly what some people need from not being put to sleep. The cases and examples are sometimes a little juvenile, certainly geared towards undergrads. I will say, however, that it is a good guide for using SPSS. I'm using it in a grad level stats class and find it adequate, especially with the extra resources on the companion website.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The first 2/3 are pretty good. You find yourself wondering exactly how a simple hitch-hiking incident can contribute to the narrative flow. But there are enough details about the characters (Reacher does his usual analysis & keen observation on each of the three.) to move the story forward. It's good enough that you forget all about how nearly improbably it's going to be watching Tom Cruise play him! The final confrontation is a bit vague (who the bad guys are, after all), and perhaps a tad too pat of a conclusion. But it's the usual \\"great escape\\" as with any Lee Child.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Terrible book. The characters are unbelievably cliche, and the story ridiculous. I bought the book mostly because of its popularity, usually popular books are a good read, but with FSOG I feel like the victim of an elaborate confidence trick.
B000I3UAJ0|3.0|The original Star Trek movie was a really big missed opportunity for the Star Trek franchise. The Original Series was defined by its wonderful characters, particularly Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. In this movie, the characters take a back seat. We still see Kirk, Spock, and McCoy but they seem muted and relatively uninteresting. They seem like accessories to the plot, not drivers of it. Even relatively emotional scenes like Kirk ordering the self-destruction of the ship had almost no tension or emotional impact. It's a shame, because the concept behind the story was really interesting.<br /><br />I will say that the Director's cut for the DVD and blu-ray does improve the film. Some of the special effects are tastefully improved. It looks good - in my opinion a visually more beautiful film than 2001.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is so much easier to use than a previous Pinterest App I had. It also doesn't force close, stall, or take me back to my home screen when I hit the back button. Recommended for all \\"Pinterest Junkies\\" like me. Works great on the Droid 3.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|The wall mounted holder looks great on the wall, it is said numerous times in these reviews that it looks like a work of art and in many ways it is very true.  Certain wine bottles don't fit in to the holes all that well and will leave them angled up or down instead of straight out, for instance, if the bottle has a higher curve towards the neck of the bottle.  However, most bottles work perfectly fine in the holder, I put a wide variety of shapes in mine and they all looked fine. Not all bottles look good sitting on their side in conventional holders either, so I wouldn't let that be a determining factor when picking this holder out.  I did not use the provided screws and drywall anchors, they are pretty flimsy.  I would recommend drilling into a stud or buying anchors that hold more weight.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This was a really good book.  I greatly enjoyed it.  I learned a lot about the Presidents.  I would highly recommend it to others who are interested in history and/or politics.
B00846REIS|3.0|I LOVED the Fifty Shades tri, so I was hoping I would love this one as much. But not quiet. don't get me wrong it was worth reading. But it just seems like the author read and studied Fifty Shades before writing. There are many similarities. I have pre-ordered the next one in this series, so we shall see. Worth reading, but it wasn't where I could not walk away from it to do other things like Fifty Shades was.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|Truly a great app! I love the accessability and motivation this app gives me to get into the word more often. however, I really do wish that the Bible portion was available offline, would help with distractions and allow me to take this app to bible study.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Stephen King is a wonderful storyteller and this book is no exception.  It's (obviously) well-written and the plot is exciting!  Jake Epping is a very compelling character and his adventure back in time has been exciting to read.  The book is so addicting that I missed my own subway stop the other day because I couldn't get my nose out of the pages...THAT'S how good this book is!

B001XVCX96|4.0|The details of the film are dated now but the underlying idea isn't.  Rebel armies looting countries of their natural resources to finance wars is the theme. And capturing and converting children into fresh recruits for the rebel armies is another theme.  It is truly frightening!  Besides the heavy stuff it's a heart rendering story set in a unique background told by actors who are at the top of their game.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|book seems to be the same as the others and no new plot. Jack Reacher has grown older and the stories do not keep time!
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I ordered the Toy Story 3 DVD set for my oldest son for his 20th birthday. It was all he ask me for and the best price I coul find was on amazon. Even the FYE stores around here couln't compete with the price even after figuring in shipping.  Totally happy with the delivery, received it about 6 days earlier then expected, and my son was excited to receive it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|since it wants me to leave a review I will. I like this game just wish it had more daily coins....more coins......I eat coins......I like this game more coins yummy more more.....
B006P0FD4W|2.0|The Movie doesn't deliver the chill through your spine as of what the first part did..... Second part was ok too but this was nutt even close.<br /><br />I just hope they make the 4th one worth watching and make u jump of ur seat.<br /><br />There were not many parts except 1 or 2 where you gonna have eerie kinda feeling and thinking that somehing gonna happen now. Even the ending wasn't up to the mark.<br /><br />Just an Average movie to kill some time if you have nutt to watch.
0525953728|4.0|This is a great book and a fascinating read. The book takes place some time before the raid with the author trying out for the elite Seal Team 6/ DEVGRU. You get a first person prospective of basically what a SEAL goes through day in and day out. We follow the author from his entry into the unit, his deployments and eventual selection for the UBL raid. He book on the raid that was conducted by two separate teams gives only one person's view of what happened and with this testimony isn't I believe the whole story. There are a few insert pictures, one a picture of an exotic night vision goggles with four lenses.<br /><br />I will leave it to the US Government and the Navy to determine if the author gave out classified information. I found that there were some sensitive information in regards to amount of time to refuel a black hawk and insertion tactics that should have been left out but pretty much most of the information is already out there.<br /><br />Finally, I must criticizes the author about his treatment of President Obama, Vice President Biden, Admiral McRaven, and the founder of DEVGRU Richard Marcinko.<br />The book is not suppose to be political or influence the upcoming election in any way. Yet, there were subtle criticized references to Obama/White House and their dislike for him. The author did give Obama credit for the order but that's all. When his unit met Obama and Biden, the fact the author initially refused to sign the flag used in the raid as a gift to Obama was ridiculous. He claims he wants to be secret but I have to say many of the signatures are barely readable and wouldn't have gave away their identity. He made McRaven as being only concerned about his career and getting another star after the raid. He watched Richared Marcinko on TV and joked how out of touch the founder was when a reporter asked what a SEAL looked and act like. Did it not cross the author's mind that Mr Marcinko was defining the Hollywood version of a SEAL to keep the media from locating and hounding them. Marcinko was giving misinformation to protect them.<br /><br />The concerns for leaks in the White House that revealed that SEALs  conducted the raid wouldn't have made too much different and could have been known by deduction.<br />The author has been concerned about leaks and having their identity revealed since the raid. Yet, he wrote the book that could identify and expose all of them. He wanted to write the book to give the true accounting of what happened and not the false information that was out there told by the White House. Again, it made no sense. Yes, the accounting needs to be made for history but the details of the raid wasn't necessary for the civilian populations to know. How this book came into being is still puzzling.<br /><br />Finally, the person who did take the shot should have been the one to make a book. If the author believes it's a team effort, than take the profits from the book and divide it evenly with the others in the group involved. Special Ops is a silent profession that do the job nobody whats. They don't \\"shoot and tell\\". The author mentioned nothing regarding the SEALs that died in the helicopter crash that came from his unit nor reaction to what happened.<br />The Epilogue was a nice touch with most of the profits going to fallen military family charities. The author should have pushed this more. There's other ways to make money for charities besides divulging classified missions but at least some good did come of it.<br /><br />In the late 90s, when the author was going though BUDs, there was a new openness to the public with TV shows,movies, and reality shows like BUDS Class 234, Tears of the Sun and Combat Missions and countless exercise books that made them larger than life. This stopped after 9/11 but many of the younger guys have gone Hollywood and want to make real money with their talents. The author reportedly signed up to work on the next \\"Medal of Honor\\" video game.<br /><br />I wouldrecommend reading the book but to be aware of the subtle leaning against the President in some passages and that this is only one persons accounting on one of two teams that assaulted the compound.recommend reading the book but to be aware of the subtle leaning against the President in some passages and that this is only one persons accounting on one of two teams that assaulted the compound.

B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I originally bought this to read to see if it would be engaging for my students - I LOVED the book and bought a hard copy which is looking well worn now that my students have gotten a hold of it. I'm being pestered to buy the next 2 in the series for them as they have really been bitten hard by the reading bug for this book - a teacher's dream come true!
0345803485|4.0|Great book, arrived in a timely fashion. I was very impressed with everything. I plan the buy the next in the series!
0691152640|4.0|What I liked<br /><br />* Anyone with a basic background in finance or economics can understand it.<br />* Well written with interesting results.<br />* Effectively drives home the point that we should not over-estimate our ability to solve economic problems.<br />* Provides interesting indicators and analysis to assess and compare crisis conditions across time and countries.<br /><br />What I did not like<br /><br />* In the Kindle version the graphs and tables are tiny and faint.  Very uncomfortable to read.  Zooming was no help.<br />* Half of the book is an appendix with tables that are uninteresting for the average reader.<br />* Although it does contain 8 centuries of folly, nearly all data presented begins in 1800.  The title is somewhat misleading.<br /><br />What you should know if you download the sample first:  From the sample you might get the impression that data and discussions are mostly anecdotal.  They are not.  They are statistical.  But still very interesting.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|In short, The Avengers is the capstone of the superhero movie genre. The casting was superb, the writing was fluid and artfully infused with humor, and the plot was intriguing and well-developed without being unnecessarily far-fetched or convoluted. The action sequences were in no short supply--and were, coincidentally, spectacular--yet never did they seem to diminish the importance of the story or characters behind and within them. If you like a little fantasy, a little wit, and a generous helping of edge-of-your-seat action, then this movie is 143 minutes very well spent. I owe Joss Whedon a handshake.
B0094KF4WG|1.0|Boring, ho hum, so what.  Read any SF book and it follows the same formula.  \\"Not a Good day to Die\\" is very good, \\"No Easy day\\" isn't worth the binary its printed on.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I had never heard of this story when I first discovered this BBC miniseries, even though I am a lifelong Anglophile and love all things British.  I had already seen Mr. Armitage in other things--\\"Robin Hood\\" and The Vicar of Dibley's \\"Wholly Happy Ending\\" and felt he was an astonishing talent (little did I know), but after watching this series, the only thing left for me to try to understand was why he wasn't already the biggest star in the world.  His portrayal of John Thornton reaches all the emotional levels one could wish, far surpassing the performance of Daniela Denby-Ashe in my humble opinion, and his scenes with his mother, played by Sinead Cusack, are pure magic.  One of the all time best of the British miniseries and makes me wish that we in America could do this kind of thing even half as well.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Simply, GREAT---Childs is consistent...and,consistently. GOOD..ALL of his REACHER novels have been truly GREAT READS---Thank you, LEE CHILDS. I look forward to more enjoyment from a super author..CEP
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Okay, Kermit is my hero and \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all time.  There are many wonderful versions of this classic story on film, but this one is dear to my heart and I watch it multiple times every year.  It helps me to remember what the holiday is all about, I love all of the songs and it makes me laugh--what more can you ask of a Christmas movie?  The retelling is brilliant and I cannot recommend it enough for all ages--somehow you forget that the \\"stars\\" are not human (except, of course, for the terrific Michael Caine) and lose yourself in the childlike wonder that I think many people have lost when it comes to this time of year.  We need more of that and more films that give that quality back to us.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't have any desire to read this series. Someone gave me their copy FSOG & dared me to read. Finished #1 @ such a cliffhanging moment that I bought FSD @2am. #2 does NOT disappoint. Book really grows on your heart (& other \\"nether regions\\". At times shocking and extremely sensual, we begin to see the real Ana grow up and into a strong, confident woman that sweetly overpowers and changes her 50 with the power of love.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Donner cut rules. The turning back time ending for 1 was taken from 2 only because the producers made Donner stop working on 2 and made him use 2s footage on 1 so they could hurry up and get 1 into theaters, then the dummies fired Donner so it was impossible for him to come up with a different ending for his cut of the film, so stop complaining you whiners! The Donner cut will always be superior over that no talent Lesters cut!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Another Jack Reacher story, fun read. Keeps you entertained through out. For Reacher fans you will not be disappointed, buy it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|enigmatis was a very good tam. even startled me a lil. the game was truly better than I thought. also enjoyed the. hidden objects.
B008NR90HQ|5.0|Even though the program is only a 74 minutes and the stage is obviously not arranged for photo elegance...when Gary Moore plays guitar its always worth a view and a listen. My favorite Gary Moore blu ray is the tribute to Phil Lynott [[ASIN:B001UGIRS0 Gary Moore & Friends: One Night in Dublin - A Tribute to Phil Lynott [Blu-ray]]] and even his last show at Montreux [[ASIN:B005FLD3H6 Live at Montreux 2010 [Blu-ray]]] I would suggest before this if you do not own. If you do own those and are a fan.... there is no reason not to enjoy this rip roaring tribute to Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />Gary Moore plays a couple of strats and even a flying V in his tribute and I do prefer the sound of his strats on this program. The few songs where he is joined by original Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell and Band of Gypsies bass player Billy Cox (Red House, Stone Free, and Hey Joe) are particular highlights for me.<br /><br />As far as rating it 5 stars...well that is because I love Gary Moore's playing and musicality and miss him and plead for more to be released. If I were to be brutally honest I could knock a star off just because there are 5 star DVDs which have better/longer shows, backstage interviews and bonus tracks and I normally reserve 5 stars for such overwhelming values but  Gary Moore's flying fingers and passion puts the extra star on this for me.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|Whereas \\"Iron Man\\" was a breath of fresh air and gave hope that a superhero film could be smart, funny, and appealing, \\"Iron Man 2\\" is more of prequel to \\"The Avengers\\".  It has a so-so story, great special effects, and lays the groundwork for the #3 most profitable movie of all time so it's not a total waste of time.  I'd give it a solid B+ rating; it definitely could have been better but Robert Downey Jr is so perfect in his role that the story problems can be forgiven easily.
B000002GAF|4.0|This early Vannelli release capitalizes on the singer's edgy jazz/rock/pop influences.  Later recordings would find Gino maturing and taking more creative risks.<br />Nonetheless, BROTHER TO BROTHER is definitely an enjoyable listening experience.  I JUST WANNA STOP, the Top Ten smash, is pure pop perfection...a lovely song with great female backup and an infectious hook.  I also like the similarly constructed WHEELS OF LIFE.  The album's showpiece is obviously the dramatic and elaborate title track, allowing the musicians to strut their considerable stuff.  BROTHER TO BROTHER is an integral addition to any Ginophile's collection.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|While it is a shame that Joss Whedon chose not to film \\"The Avengers\\" in 3D (and opt for a post conversion), this film is still amazing.  Whedon is the master at balancing multiple main characters (the TV show Buffy comes to mind) and he was definitely the right pick for writing and directing the climax to what Marvel Studios had been trying to build for the past couple years.  Do yourself a favor and watch this film over and over again.<br /><br />Oh and Whedon's version of the Hulk is the best thus far!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is so so so so awesome!!!!!!! I love it and every thing about it in some games it is cheasy becase it is like free hay and then there turns out to be payed for stuff.this is nothing like that!!!!!!!!!!AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B004UID2LC|3.0|the app was working perfectly and now it wont let me download anymore. I'm very disappointed. Please fix it soon!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i enjoy playing i just wish playing time before I get more coins was less I also would like more when not on game as i switch back and forth to my book I am reading
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good book, if the facts are correct, then the media and/or the government has been lying to the public, not only about bin Ladin  but other missions as well.  Then again what's new!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Very disappointing to read such nonsense porn from a female author... My expectations were high and the book failed to deliver.
B0097E06EU|5.0|I didnt really have high hopes for this but it turned out to be quite entertaining and better than the remake.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i don't know what I ever did without it. genius! the  possibilities are endless and so many interesting things I never knew or would have thought of.
B001FB4VXU|2.0|the package came early however it was missing the 4th dvd to the set! I would recomend opening the package ight away and seeing if all of the product is in the package!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I purchased this item for my daughter and she was very happy to get it. I haven't watched it but she was pleased so I'm sure it was fine.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I, like a good amount of people read the book before seeing the movie. A good amount of things were left out. It felt way too rushed, and they left out the two best lines in the book. Act I was very good. The build up to the games was good, I think they did a great job displaying the capitol as it is in the book. The part with Rue and the flowers was quite touching to see it, they did that part right. If anything was rushed it was the last Act, it leaves the viewer somewhere between a cliffhanger and wondering what just happened. The main problem with the movie in my opinion, is that there isn't nearly enough information about the society that they are living in.
B008VBYN80|1.0|Does not work on my Kindle Fire. I have to shut off my Kindle then turn it back on to be able to use my Kindle again. This game should be patched with a fix. Then tested on ALL models of Kindle & Android devices before it is released to the game playing public.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all of the Jack Reacher books.  This one is OK but not as exciting as some of the earlier ones.  It takes a long time getting started.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher latest book is outstanding as usual. The car ride was long, but it kept my interest as all Lee Childs books. Lee Childs books are always great and this is up there with the rest of his books. My top writers right now is Lee Child and Vince Fynn.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|The second season shows how a gentile form of corruption (first season) evolved into total violence as the economics of the illegal liquor trade took hold. Wonderful character development.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This was so funny and adorable I would definitely recommend it not just for young children but also for any age Dr Seuss does it again
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|when I grow up all I wanna be is a drawer or artist with this app I can show other people how I draw and maybe if they like they will comment and saying something nice
B008C1O8CA|3.0|First things first: yes this is better than \\"21st Century Breakdown\\". I have already listened to this twice, which is one more time than I bothered spinning that record.<br />Secondly, there is no overarching theme here, no grander story they are trying to tell. And thank God for that. \\"Uno!\\" is a straight up pop-punk record with twelve catchy tunes that borrow greatly from other artists but still sound like Green Day. You can even periodically hear Mike Dirnt's bass (always my favorite part of Green Day) underneath the multitudes of guitars.<br />So why the three song rating? Well, first off, there's a lot of inflation of ratings in this site. People want to give anything they enjoyed five stars. Well, that to me means classic. \\"London Calling\\", \\"Exile on Main Street\\", \\"The Queen is Dead\\". And this is not any of those records. But also, simply put, this record, while fun to listen to, never seems to have any passion to it.<br />Really it seems like these songs were written and recorded as an excuse to go out on tour. And while they may sound good during your next Green Day show, I can't see anyone six months from now really wanting to listen to \\"Carpe Diem\\" or \\"Troublemaker\\", good songs they may be, over anything they released over their lengthy career. Add to that, there are a few tracks here that simply did not work for me. \\"Kill The DJ\\" is fun enough but really just made me want to pull of my Franz Ferdinand record rather than listen to it again. \\"Sweet 16\\" struck me as sort of creepy and weird being sung by men in their forties. And the lead off single \\"Oh Love\\" still sounds like the most mediocre Who song ever written.<br />So, should you buy Green Day \\"Uno!\\" Well, that really depends. If you are a longtime fan, why not? You will get a nostalgic blast from the record and it's always fun to know the new songs when you are going to see a band live. You probably will file it away in a few months and not return to it often, but I'm sure it will look cool with yourCD collection or in your iTunes library.<br />New to the band, however? Probably not your best to start. Because while \\"Uno!\\" is a perfectly pleasant album its never a great one. And Green Day have released a few of those in their career.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|I've probably tried just about all the notepads and list makers on my Kindle Fire. My search is over, Wunderlist is the best. Clean, professional interface that took no time to master, and it syncs unbelievably easily between Windows-KF-cell.<br /><br />Thanks to one reviewer I knew going in to type in your list name or task and tap the plus symbol on the right end of the entry bar. Simple and intuitive.<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars only because I would like to be able to drag and drop undated tasks and sort my lists like I do in Outlook at work. Not a show-stopper though; outstanding app.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is the most exciting fictional hero in a long time.  I eagerly anticipate the next book by Lee Child to see who and what he's going to annihilate next!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is the perfect and easy downloader for videos. I download all my grandsions barney videos etc.... Love this app. Thanks
B0081KTI0E|4.0|I found that the ratings of this show were a little harsh. No there wasn't some amazing mind blowing twist at the end of this movie, but it didnt need it. It was a good well contained family friendly thriller.if you haven't seen it I suggest you should.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like the design and its quick and easy to use. it accurately measures the charge on my kindle. its pretty cool. does what it says.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|Excellent and a lot of fun!I recommend this show to anyone who loves a good act and wants to be reminded of their own adolecense.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Fairly good read, but rather disturbing and unsatisfying ending.  Certainly keeps your attention and there are plenty of twists and turns.
0880796863|1.0|I have been a reader for over 30 years and am a mentor with the American Tarot Association. I think I know the Rider deck pretty good. The art work is there in this printed in China deck but the colors are way off!!!!!!! What should be blue is green. I feel I have wasted my money as I will never read with this deck and the printing is of such poor quality I won't even use it as a gift or freebie give away. If you want the Rider Waite deck, look for the one from US Games in the yellow box with the Magician on the front. Otherwise go for the Universal Waite US Games also. But stay away from this bad China copy!!!!!!!
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I started reading the Kindle version on my windows 7 laptop and immediately noticed formatting issues even when viewing in full screen mode and I have the latest version of Kindle. You can still read it but the flow is off and formatting issues made charts/list look like info was missing.<br /><br />However, formatting is great on my Motorola Xoom tablet in both landscape and portrait mode, while my Samsung Charge only has good formatting in landscape mode.<br /><br />*I didn't want to rate the book down just because of poor Kindle formatting.
B008578PRK|4.0|Gorgeous and well done.  Well - acted, however, I would have preferred more spookiness.  Sometimes he seems less scared in a haunted house than one imagines one would be.  Very watchable though.  Recommend.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I have been watching this disk for the last 2 hours with my mouth agape. This is nothing short of stunning. The performances are spectacular.<br /><br />But the one artist that I couldnt beleive was Charise. OMG I was almost in tears as she sang Witney Houston as I remembered her. How that sound can come from such a small body is mind blowing. I closed my eyes and I could have sworn Whitney was there.<br /><br />Just buy this Disk !!!!!!!!!!!!! .<br /><br />I dont think I have ever felt like this after watching a concert disk. The old songs I never knew who wrote them ended up being David Foster. This man is Awesome and from my side unknown......<br /><br />Just bought the next concert disk David Foster Hitman RETURNS. From all reports its even better.<br /><br />Cant wait.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is the best game I bought today! its the best game because it doesn't time you and it gives you a lot of coins
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This works well and with a light weight pad it is about the same weight as a paperback to use
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|very enjoyable game!! I had to use the hints a lot but it was still very fun. I would recommend. this game to anyone who likes mysteries.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very addicting. But don't really care to wait to get coins. Something to do to pass time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love this book, could'nt stop reading it I normally buy book to help me sleep but this one actually did the oposite.<br />I was so hookt up that i barely slept in 2 day

B006AZZPCM|5.0|Some downloaders work only some of the time or even freeze on my Kindle - this one works always.<br />You have to press refresh to see your new mp3 or video and be aware that the average download is 10+ MB.<br />I cannot confirm any performance complaints.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I hope commentaries and dictionaries will be added in the near future.  If these are linked to the Bible versions, it will be helpful.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it! Especially the reading plans!<br />It give you a wide variety of options. Also love the fact the Books can be read to you. Great for reading and listening to.
B005HSL626|1.0|it crashed the first time I played it its boring and pointless I'm uninstalling don't get this app it sucks
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|D oes every I need and then some more.  Great program that keeps amazing me with its versatility!  My phone and Kindle Fire wouldn't be the same without it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can sit here for hours looking at this stuff!!! Absolutely love it!!! I've gotten so much ideas from this site...
B003VA3JUO|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  We have it in VHS but now we can enjoy it on DVD.  My 17 y.o son also thought the movie was \\"awesome\\".
B004AGI2L4|5.0|Awesome storyline, great action, good acting, story moves right along - does not drag, filmed on location making it very realistic, really liked the way characters from earlier in plot brought back into play.
B002WWKZJK|4.0|Such a nice feel-good book. I have read plenty of Heyer's books, and this one definitely would be amongst my favorites. The premise is simple, chemistry is subtle but continually develops. The only thing that was pretty tedious was the prolonged end and boring dialogues of the brother and his friends as they try to safe the heroine's reputation.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is an awesome app to learn how to read the Bible and to get your daily inspirations while you're on the go!
B0087HT36U|5.0|great game awesome game play better than angry bird IMO<br />well worth the $1 easily lots of levels lots of thinking
B0087HT36U|3.0|This game was very addictive.  Very similar to Angry Birds......but a lot easier.  I was not happy with the fact that I paid for the game and then they wanted more money for the bomb boasters.  Not very encouraging. Anyway I did enjoy the game.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is very informative about the culture and esprit of the Navy Seal program.  It also contains fascinating accounts of Seal missions, including the assault at Abbottabad.  I can't say that I think anything has been compromised regarding national security by the accounts.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|not much of a fantasy game person but this game is pretty good. I still like BT Gangsta better and deerhunter but this is awesome also. everyone should at least give it a try.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was torn between giving this book 3 stars and 4 stars.  Finally, I decided on 4 stars, as the book was griping and surprising at times--a quality that I did not think the first two books possessed.<br /><br />*Spoiler alert*<br /><br />For the first 1/3 or 1/4 of the book, I found myself utterly disappointed.  I expected some sort of grand unveiling of District 13.  Instead, I found myself utterly plunged into the new story without much time to even catch my breath.  Throughout this first part of the book, we find that the two runaways that Katniss met in Catching Fire never made it to District 13, but no explanation is given, other than speculation that they must have died along the way, which I find somewhat difficult to believe.  After getting only a little ways into it, I actually considered stopping reading it.  The only reason I read the second book was to find out what happened, and in the end, I felt utterly disappointed.  I did not want to feel the same way after finishing this book.  Looking back, I'm glad I finished it.<br /><br />The remaining parts of the book were griping enough.  Peeta's return was surprising and I actually felt sad for Katniss when I discovered that he was brainwashed.  For me, the end of the war was satisfying, but in the sense that it was realistic, which was something I did not expect.  For me, what made this book so great were the ideas behind it.  Katniss being used as a pawn, propaganda being so powerful in the war.  Both sides used tools to try and sway the public as it were.  Using Prim's death to manipulate Katniss actually made me stop for a second to think.  It was definitely a well-thought out plot point by Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />In the end, the reason I was so torn about giving the book 3 or 4 stars was because some of the biggest arcs in the book left me feeling cheated and unsatisfied.  When Peeta returned to Katniss, I couldn't feel happiness, I could only feel sadness.  In the end, it was almost Peeta was chosen over Gale for her; she did not choose Peeta herself.  The ending of the book also left me feeling that way.  It was almost as if Katniss never found happiness.  Although she got a happy ending, I think she was still very sad on the inside.  Perhaps it is more realistic in that sense, but I honestly wanted to feel satisfied at some point in Mockingjay, because I followed Katniss from the first book.  I felt that my dedication to the heroine was not rewarded in any way.  At the very least, I think Katniss should have had some sort of character growth.  She spent all three books being manipulated and the final puppet string to control her was losing Prim.  Instead of living the rest of her life in misery, she should have severed that string.  While, I think it is perfectly acceptable for her to have grieved for Prim for a while, I think I really wanted to see the girl that fought for her life in the Hunger Games pick herself up and move forward instead of staring back at the past.
B008I3QZKU|2.0|Sorry, folks, I wasn't impressed.  The Killers have gone soft on me.  I heard a lot of sappy, boring love songs on this one.  I guess I'm in the camp of people that would like to hear that old band that managed to make 80's rock cool in the 00's.  Sam's Town was a masterpiece.  Hot Fuss was an awesome debut.  Sawdust was a great compilation.  After that, the Killers became a little boring to me.  Day and Age was just weird and hard to listen to and this one was a little boring.  There were a few bright spots.  I like Runaway a lot and if you got the extended version, Prize Fighter kind of gets stuck in your head.  Most everything else is not memorable, IMO.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app! ive been waiting for what seems like ever for an app for pinterest. honestly no complaints from me. except for it forces closed every once in a while. but it seems those bugs are slowly getting fixed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Both mom and teenaged daughters loved all three Hunger Games books and this one is no exception.  Will keep you entertained regardless of your age.
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. Such a great storyline with enough action to keep me intently focused.
B0099G3I96|5.0|You can take one of two approaches to music.  One, you can embrace many different styles and bands and grow your taste and evolve.  Or you can be a stick in the mud that's grumpy that your childhood band didn't re-release your favorite album with new lyrics.  And somehow this is their fault for evolving and not yours for being a stick in the mud.<br /><br />As an old punk and ska loving rude boy, No Doubt sold out for me 17 years ago.  As a lover of music however, I can easily appreciate the direction they've grown.  Yeah, they're a total pop band.  But Gwen is a great vocalist and this album is certainly interesting.  There are really only three or four stand out tracks...but those tracks are amazing; great poppy dancehall vibe!  If I want to get my skank on or go start a circle pit, I'll throw on the hundreds of old albums I have from bands I've loved for decades.  That's good enough for me and so is this album.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher books always hold your interest.  They are always intriguing.  I sometimes wonder how long Lee Child can continue with this series.  Hopefully forever.  I have a doctor who received a Kindle and the entire series of Jack Reacher books as a gift from a friend.  The doctor enjoys Jack Reacher books (and his Kindle)  immensely.  Does that say enough for Lee Child' abilities?
B006MW3UZW|1.0|Did not know this DVD could not be viewed in US... did not say that it was region designated.  Had to order from Target...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you are interested in the subject matter of U.S. special operations in Iraq and Afganistan including the Bin Laden elimination in Pakistan, this book will hold your interest and provide the information from a point of view we have not seen. Up close and personal. The author held true to his statement that it was not a political work. The Bin Laden raid was given a large portion of the story, and did correct the record in regard to who actually accomplished this task. I don't think that anyone would be surprised by the details unless of course they were the people that think a politician is a god. Oops, I guess that leaves only the thinking people (independents and republicans) that would be interested in the book. Sorry. On second thought, the democrat reader might actually find a reason in this book to flatter the current President. The author found a way to be respectful of the President without distorting the facts. Our current President did more to prevent the U.S. from being able to accomplish this feat than he did to expedite it; however, he did allow the mission to proceed. I personally don't believe he had a political option. The author presented this in a factual context based on how his operational tactics changed when the current administration transitioned into power. The author did not present a political opinion only an operational description. All political opinions in this review are mine and based on facts from the book as well as other sources. The lying liberal media has not been one of my sources for over 30 years. This book is an important work for keeping our country safe from those who wish to harm it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child has done it again! Jack Reacher is one of my favorite characters. I always look forward to what he will do next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AMAZING! I could not make myself put this book down  Such an amazing storyline and twisted love story for readers
B005OYKI1I|5.0|At first, I was not sure if FAST FIVE would be worth my time but after watching it; I wanted more.  There is plenty of action from the sick driving scenes to the hardcore fights free-for-all.  From the beginning to the end this movie does keep you on your seats waiting for the next plot turn.  The Rock, to me, stole the show.  His kick-ass take no prisoners until the job is done mentally is GREAT.  The ending after the credits is a must see and leaves you with more questions than answers.  This movie is a great pick for a rental or too own you can't go wrong with either decision.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Great movie, great action from start to finish, a real mans movie if you know what I mean.<br />But one BIG complaint about it. I rented this on Amazon Instant video, so I don't know if this goes for any other media, but I think it must happen in any media of this movie.<br /><br />The sound quality. When the people are just talking to each other even at highest volume on my computer I can barely make out their words, but when someone is shooting or screaming or something blows up the sound is almost deafeaning.<br />To me this is a huge screw-up. I'm straining my ears to hear human dialogue with no background noise at all, turning up the volume to the highest level just to hear normal speak.<br />A sound effect comes along and I have to cover my ears it's so damn loud.<br /><br />I loved the movie but the sound quality really really pissed me off.
0307594165|5.0|Home is the best written book I have read in years. Toni Morrison's Home is about a Black Korean War Veteran with post traumatic stress syndrome and his sister he tries to protect. In 147 pages it describes racism, refuge with family, hurt, innocence broken, belief in war and trust in authority shattered, love betrayed, damage inflicted, refuge within the true community family, and a restoration of dignity.<br /><br />I expect it to become a classic and prizewinner.  It belongs on every High School reading list.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never heard of some of the words used in this book.<br /><br />I read it and felt weird and turned on at the same time.<br /><br />NOT FOR CHILDREN WHAT-SO-EVER
0062082353|4.0|U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle has more than 160 confirmed kills -- 255 if you cut out all the ridiculous paperwork one has to fill out to get credit for a single confirmed kill. Add in politicians insisting on nonsensical Rules of Engagement (an insurgent can get away with killing a U.S. troop by dropping his gun and giving up) and you get a sense of the sanitized war men like Kyle had to fight in order to avenge 9/11 and protect his country and fellow SEALs and U.S. Marines.<br />This super fast-reading book is the story about a good ole boy from Texas who wanted to challenge himself as far as he could by becoming a Navy SEAL. When the Twin Towers came down, Kyle, whom his teammates jokingly called \\"The Legend,\\" went on to show how much damage one man could do during four deployments in Iraq, which he describes as a \\"target-rich environment.\\"<br />Though he claims not to be a scorekeeper, Kyle went on to record more kills than any other U.S. sniper in history, including the legendary Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock (USMC). Did it bother his Christian morals? Not when he sees the enemy as evil \\"savages,\\" which is hard to argue with given the nature of their heinous acts.<br />The book is stuffed with some vivid details of Kyle's best shots -- a two-in-one on a couple of moped-riding, RPG-carrying mujahideen (\\"I mean, come on,\\" writes Kyle), a record 2100-yard shot, and his own unique tale of taking down attackers floating toward him on beach balls.<br />It's these types of stories, not to mention acts of valor (Kyle earned two Silver Stars, five Bronze Stars with a 'V' for Valor, and three other medals and one commendation) that make the book so easy to read and almost -- but not quite -- cause the reader to wonder if he or she is feeling a guilty pleasure.<br />For his part, Kyle offers no apologies and would have been happy to add to his record, which includes taking out a woman who pulled the pin on a Chinese grenade while she had her child in tow.<br />It issort of a different autobiography, one in which his wife offers her feelings and thoughts on Kyle. I didn't mind the injection of another point of view, especially when the divorce rate among SEALs is 95-percent.<br />Kyle takes you through his days in the rodeo and BUD/S training, not to mention his breakdown on his many instruments of death -- his rifles. Kyle not only was a sniper, but kicked in many doors in support of the Marines during their battle in Fallujah. There are many heart-wrenching moments, as it wasn't only insurgents who were doing the dying.<br />Also of note is Kyle's story of punching out a famous ex-SEAL whom he doesn't name, but has been rumored to be Jesse Ventura.<br />Raucous, rowdy, record-setting -- Kyle's story is more than interesting and unique enough for you to buy the book and judge for yourself.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game and the physics are excellent. I would highly recommend it for all ages and anyone that enjoys a challenge!
B005FITIK0|4.0|I just got pinged by Amazon - a web site in which you might be familiar - that recommended the movie \\"Young Adult,\\" most likely based upon my previous ratings.  Well, I've already seen it and I really liked it.  So to Amazon I would say, \\"Better late than never\\" but it made me want to rate it.<br /><br />Now, Charlize Theron is not just another pretty face.  She proves that over and over, and if you disagree with me, just watch \\"Monster.\\"  (Yikes.  While her performance was maybe too good in that film since she was the spitting image of the serial killer she played, she surely couldn't be called \\"attractive\\" in that film.  Must have required some great makeup work and incredible acting.  A big recommendation by me on that film as well, however.)  But in real life, if you took Ms. Theron's looks away she would still get work, and that's what I would call an actress.<br /><br />But she also has terrific range.  \\"Devil's Advocate,\\" where she plays the confused housewife where her life is falling apart.  \\"Monster,\\" just mentioned.  \\"Hancock,\\" where her performance - and the movie itself - was highly underrated.  \\"Snow White and the Huntsman,\\" where she played the meanest person in history.  And then \\"Young Adult,\\" where she plays a completely unsympathetic character, but paradoxically one that you still care about for some reason.  (Can't quite explain why or how this is possible, but it just is.  At least to me.  Maybe it was her acting?  Maybe it was because she gets humiliated at one point and you understand her pain?  Who knows?)<br /><br />Now, we haven't even talked about Patton Oswalt yet.  He is pitch-perfect here, a guy that for some reason understands the Ms. Theron character, and maybe even cares about her.  Perhaps he's looking at it from the same perspective as the audience?  Maybe he's just looking for someone to hang out with and drink home-grown whiskey?<br /><br />A pretty big recommendation from me on \\"Young Adult.\\"  But then again, can you ever go wrong watching a Theron film?
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Ordered this for a friend. It arrived in excellant condition & in only 2 days! She's happy. I have seen it before and I don't care for it. I would never purchase it for myself.
B006LSZECO|5.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" just became my all-time favorite novel beating out \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\", \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and, perhaps lesser known, \\"The Gargoyle\\", and \\"April & Oliver\\". Gillian Flynn just became my ultimate literary crush. As a writer of contemporary fiction, I have a true appreciation for the mastery of writing. Ms. Flynn's command of language, narrative, and dialog is a talent to behold. I first read the Kindle version of \\"Gone Girl\\"; and then I bought the hardcover copy so I could feed my incessant need to study her talent and better understand her literary technique and style. Flynn's ability to bring out both the worst and best in her characters is easily splayed across each and every page. No notion is left unexplored or unattended as Flynn effectively dismantles the romanticism that still persists around the quest for the perfect marriage, the perfect relationship, and in being the perfect beautiful couple for the world. Flynn toys with readers at the beginning and in her own fastidious way lets the story out in infinitesimal detail in the very first paragraph on page one:<br /><br />\\"What are you thinking, Amy? The question I've asked most often during our marriage, if not out loud, if not to the person who could answer. I suppose these questions stormcloud over every marriage: What are you thinking? How are you feeling? Who are you? What have we done to each other? What will we do?\\"<br /><br />Just the choice use of the verb stormcloud bowls me over. Wow.<br /><br />Readers slowly discern that handsome Nick Dunne is not all that he portrays himself to be and that his narcissism is not all that far removed from his reality, nor is he all that sorry about it.<br /><br />The unraveling begins. And, it takes a while for readers to realize it is \\"us\\".<br /><br />\\"Okay,\\" we say, even as we start to guess what's gone wrong here. But, do we really know?<br /><br />And, just when we think we've figured it out, the story gets more sinister as Flynn subtly reminds all of us that this roller coaster ride is far from over. And,as she finesses further with growing intrigue, readers are introduced to Amy through a variety of diary entries. Invariably, readers will buy into all of this clever character's thoughts and feelings--hook, line and sinker. We're all but drowning in the psychotic push-pull of the back and forth narrative of these two, even while we sense the unraveling that exudes so deliberately from both Amy and Nick.<br /><br />Invariably, as readers, we will want to save the victims. But, which ones are they? Who do we save? Ourselves? Flynn flexes her literary brilliance throughout this novel, both in her ability to write and tell the story, but also in the subtle way she keeps all of us captivated by it...<br /><br /><more> at: bit(dot)ly/GRsReviewGoneGirl
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This movie never got going and then it died.  Stupid premise, unbelievably unbeleivable characters, boring, boring,boring.  Liam Neeson must have needed the money.  I feel like I wasted mine.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|great hack and slash game .one of the best of its kind available. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes hack and slash games.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child always tells a great story; I wait every year for the next Jack Reacher book.  I have influenced many of my friends to read Child's books.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Works great and sounds awesome with my Canon camcorder. I haven't had any problems with it so far, just watch that you don't trip over the long cord.
B008XG1X18|4.0|The Pinterest app for the Kindle Fire really takes advantage of the device's nimble size and fast browsing. An avid Pinterest User I found using it on the laptop was often tedious due to the lag from the use of javascript from the website. The app eliminates this and provides a seemless navigating experience. The only annoyance  is that it often crashes on opening.
B0099G3I96|2.0|When I heard that after 11 years, No Doubt's new album was finally coming out this week, I picked it up right away. After two listens so far, all I can say is that I wish it was better. There's no instantly catchy tunes, like there was on \\"Rock Steady\\" (other than maybe Settle Down). The songs sound more like a Gwen Stefani solo effort than a No Doubt record. Where's the humor? Where's the playfulness? Where's the kick-ass beats?? There's no rough edges on these songs. It pains me to say this, since I've been a No Doubt fan since the early days, and I really wanted to like this effort after so many years, but I have a feeling this will soon be just another forgotten album in my record collection.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This game was nice and long and very enjoyable. At times it took thought to solve it. Lots of evrything needed in a hidden object game. I really enjoyed it form start to finish.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The second book of this series gave me a lot more background on the characters.  You never know what is next.......I'm already looking forward to #3!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved it! Awesome plot, and a lot of sex! ;P Wondering if she will write another one in Christian's perspective. That'd be interesting.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|first they copied and second its so hard to move the mart I would not get it. its not worth the time to play it
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a sober, factual account of the teams and mission that brought justice to Bin Laden.  \\"Owen\\" and his ilk, of which there are few, are the true warrior patriots who protect the greatest country in the history of man without all the end zone dancing.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This is not the Reacher I have grown to love.  I waited anxiously the last year for this books and purchased it, should haave waited for the library copy.  It was a accounting of an almost acceptable story but never made it that far.  I love Lee Child's work but this failed to interest me.  I continued in the vain hope it would get better, it didn't and then he scrambles to find a way to end it.  It was uninteresting and uninspiring over-all.  I am hoping the next Michael Connelly book is more satisfying.  With so little discretional money to spend on books, this was not a wise choice for me.  I hope others find it more entertaining than I did.<br /><br />Mr Child please bring back the original \\"Reacher\\" he is missed.<br /><br />Deb W.<br />Toledo Ohio
B008GOAFBQ|3.0|I bought this hoping for a fuller sound versus what i've listened to for the last 20 some odd years on the original CD release, I got that.....but with some bugaboos.<br /> As soon as I put the disc in the player I thought to myself, \\" God, I hope they kept Detroit Rock City in it's original version, not that Smashes, Trashes remix version I hear on the radio occasionaly with the tacked on , 'Get Up's' added on for absolutley NO reason\\". And that's exactly what I got.  I could not hate that version of an absolutle KISS classic more.  So right there, the whole thing was ruined for me.  It ain't goin into the MP3 catalog.  The rest of the songs have much more subtle differences, but none as glaring as the Detroit Rock City one.  Sweet Pain with the different solo is odd to hear when you've heard the original version all your life, but I can live with that one.<br /> The ads I saw said there'd be pictures from that era included......there are 6.  The most entertaining one to me is the tiny cut out from an old Columbia House Record Club catalog.  Seeing the abbreviations at the bottom for the 4 different types of music media back in the day gave me a chuckle.  Anyone else remember reel to reel?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this works with ease. I am a Math guru, however this works like mathematics for dummies. I wish I could use this app at work, I like it better than my $89 one.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am a 50 Shades obsessed but, Bared to You is one of my newly favorite books.  I love how Eva is strong headed and Gideon is powerful.  I absolutely adored this book.  So much so that I read it 4 times already.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This is a great application. The best part is the graph! I use it to see what is the biggest hog of power.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This portrayal of the Jack Reacher character moved in a different direction this time, as he exhibited some nearly \\"savant\\" abilities with arithmetic and spatial relations skills, that were heretofore untapped. Gave him a \\"Rainman\\" type feel at times, which I enjoyed. The story line had enough wrinkles and the continual action, the hallmark of this series, was enough to maintain my interest, and I completed the book in one sitting. Well recommended.
B007JMW46U|5.0|To say it's Sherlock Holmes would be enough except for this 20 word limit imposed by Amazon :-). If you're a lover of classic mystery stories, as I am, this book will be a delight. The collection contains stories as chronicled by Sherlock Holmes' able bodied assistant James Watson, The mysteries are always intriguing to Holmes and unique in such a way that they pose some form of deductive challenge for the world's best deductive reasoner. Once you begin to read you will be taken back to old England in a time where the world was just beginning to use science as a means of development rather than warfare and chivalry was still alive and kicking, this book is a must read for all you book lovers!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I installed this calculator app about 5 months ago and use it constantly. No issues,  super simple to use,  well designed.  I was new to the world of apps last fall and in one years time I have downloaded quite a few apps that over promise and UNDER deliver.  this Calculator plus app is exactly what I hoped it would be.
B008X9Z37A|1.0|Don't waste your money ... this case is junk. Poor quality, and bad design. There are no holes in the back for the dual speakers on the Fire HD, so it muddles the audio. No magnets to hold the flap down. It will not stand up on it's own. The material it's made from has that cheap, plastic feel to it, slides around if you try to hold it with one hand. It only seems like a good deal at $20 because Amazon's official cases are so outrageously expensive. I'm returning, and trying one of the $7-$15 cases (which Amazon conveniently doesn't list under the \\"Fire HD Cases\\" section, you have to search for them).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Never before have I had such an interest in fictional stories. Cant wait to read the last of the trilogy!
1573228737|5.0|This writer has a way of placing you where ever she wants you.  You fall into another era and it seems so real that it is as if you were there.  She seems to like to mix up timelines a bit but once you realize what she is doing it seems like a great idea.  The characters seem very real and are for the most part undergoing some deep personal changes.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a fabulous book! I just could not put it down, and it gave me all the information I have always wanted to know. I feel security was not breached and yet I now better understand the value of having these men taking care of our security and safety!
B007PVHAN2|5.0|This documentary was absolutely fabulous! It brought a whole new understanding about who Bob was as a person and as a musician.When I saw Manley and Seaga shake hands at the \\"One Love\\" concert I almost fell off my couch.There is so much power behind One Love. It was even able to bring two rivals together if only for a moment. If we all, a conscious people worked together, world wide, is it possible to have....One Love?
0385344333|1.0|As boring as 61 Hours. It felt like Lee Child let someone else write this one for him. Reacher is tough & never lets anyone take him where he doesn't want to go. In this one he is as docile as a lamb & just follows along wherever.<br />I always pre-order Reacher books before they even come out. I would like to get my money back for this one. Next one out I will read the reviews before buying it. Waste of money as far as I'm concerned. He doesn't even hit anyone til page 309 & then it's just a tap. blah blah blah
B006H5120E|5.0|I am happy now to have this blu ray in my movie collection. In my opinion this is the best movie of all the times. I super strongly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|A book that reveals really nothing new (and therefore I don't understand what's the fuss?) and serves in my opinion no function other than fundraising for fallen service personel if that is indeed where the money goes. As for truth in the story, there is no way of crosschecking HIS facts and therefore you just have to trust the word of someone who swore he wouldn't reveal anything about his missions or service in the first place.<br />All the bashing aside, it's little over ten bucks and if the money indeed goes to charity it's worth the price. Fun to read it may save you if you are stuck in a boring place or it's raining outside. It will keep you entertained but it won't blow your mind.
B008XJM8IW|2.0|I am bummed due to the fact that no where in the ordering process did I see it indicate that this was a censored version.  I'm a big boy and this product is basically useless.  The breaks where there is adult language totally disrupts the music to the point where it really is not worth the money.  I am planning on returning the product tomorrow and will be cancelling my order for the two other CD's that I pre-ordered.  I wanted GREEN DAY and I got censored crap...  very sad...
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was our September book club pick. I was extremely skeptical about reading it because it was non-fiction. This book blasted all of my pre-conceived notions out of the water. Great book. Highly recommend.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|and I just watched it.  couldn't stop... two days later, all done with the 12 episodes and WOW what a great show.  I got it on blu-ray yesterday and friends came over last night and everyone loved it!  Creepy and Fun  Great Acting!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I should preface my review in saying that I am in my mid twenties and prefer classics to most of the books written today. The target audience for this book is probably 10-15 years old. My mom teaches third grade, and her 8 and 9 year old students enjoyed this series. This book is a sad attempt at merging The Lottery with Battle Royale. I read it because of the hype about the movie, which should have been my first clue that I wouldn't like it. (I like to read the book before I see the film if there is one.) It was not the most terrible book I've ever wasted time reading, but it was among the worst. There was very poor character development aside from the main character, and even then it could have been better for her. In a series, the first book is meant to draw you in by making you empathize with the main character(s), but I didn't feel anything for the protagonist in this book. I found myself counting down the pages until I was finished reading instead of being sucked into the story. I wish it had been better, but this book was not something that interested me. I will not be finishing this series.
B003HKN51Q|4.0|This Blu-Ray Book edition really takes me back...my brother and I saw The King in 1972 at the old Chicago Stadium and what a day that was! This DVD package is a great memento of those electric tour moments. The thrill of seeing/hearing Elvis LIVE is tough to top.To be fair, though, his concerts could have been longer (about an hour, and Elvis left the building), and could certainly have featured more of his own catalogue....I mean literally a hundred great Elvis originals could have been sung.This is not to say there's a bad performance of any of the material...but I never understood the prioritization of performing his take on chart toppers by Tony Joe White, 3 Dog Night, CCR, etc.. I mean, this IS ELVIS for heavens' sake! Shouldn't it be the other way around? Having said that, WHAT SOUND on this DVD! Far and away the best feature you get here. Superb! The picture is great, but not stunning...I'd say average for Blu Ray DVD's I've watched on my Sony Blu Ray player. The backstage footage and rehearsal footage are always a special keepsake. The \\"book\\" is cool too. Biggest disappointment is the lack of special features. Blu Ray purchasers are used to lavish special features or at least SOME. There are none, except scene selection. I imagine that anything ELViS could get complicated contractually to compile....but this package yearns for bonus interviews with James Burton, the Stamps, the Sweet Inspirations,.....etc.. Perhaps at a later date. This is a must-have Blu Ray book keepsake for Elvis fans who saw him on tour....or wish they could have. But, like those 70's concerts....could have been even better. One final comment on packaging...there's a full covering sticker (loosely attached) on the back of the case, masking what was originally printed on the back....to obviously comply with current contents vs.  what was originally listed. Kind of mysterious. I haven't removed the sticker to compare notes. If I do, I'll update this review.
B003I87O2I|4.0|When I bought this CD I had some doubt because Lou Gramm was not the lead vocalist. As I started listening to it, I would have sworn it was Foreigner's original singer on all of the tracks; Kelly Hanson sounds that much like him. An enjoyable album throughout with only a few weak tracks. This is a great comeback album for the group even though most of the original members are no longer part of the current Foreigner lineup. This is a much better CD than Bruce Springsteen's \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" because it retains the original sound of the band, unlike Springsteen's critically applauded but lackluster latest effort.<br /> The standout tracks on the album are: Angel Tonight, Can't Slow Down, Too Late, When It Comes to Love,and Lonely. The only song I don't care much for is Ready, all of the rest are first rate.
B006ISJQ26|1.0|Not what I expected. Too many stories that do not connect. Acting is decent but poor storyline. Would not recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm currently trying to quit smoking. When I get the urge for a cigarette; I play a game of solitare. I'm concentrating on winning the game that I forget about smoking. This game is so much easier than the traditional card game and I always have it with me. Yea! Solitaire!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good games and a lot of fun.Just wish I could say the same for the music although there is an option to mute.Thank you for a great time killer.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever released. The artwork and design lend to M&S's signature feel. Not one song is drab. I know it is a minor detail but there is no indication on the album to where it was manufactured which is sort of uncommon (I'm an infogeek :P). I was wary that this album might not meet expectations as Sigh No More is amazing in itself, and for Marcus & Co to surpass it would have been a feat, and they did!<br /><br />My favorite song is Holland Road. There is something eerie that gives me chills from that song. It strikes a feeling of nostalgia, and the melody of the trumpet/flugelhorn is beautiful.<br /><br />Whether you are a fan of M&S's or not, this album is a must have. Music of this quality is quite uncommon in these modern times.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This is one of the best action/scifi movies ever made!!! Fantastic effects, great music, fun seeing fresh faces in a movie rather than the same old retreads. Like a combination of the best elements of Independence Day, Transformers and Star Trek....only perhaps even better. Great fun for the whole family!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I thought it was a little too quick but it is addictive you just can't put it down.cute app if you are bored buy this app now!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I love Imagine Dragons!  I like just about every song on the CD \\"Night Visions.\\"  They have a unique sound which is truly refreshing! I have been telling all my friends and family to check them out and you should too!  You won't be disappointed!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this was my fav.  game growing up so I had to get it and its just as good as I remembered.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This is a good entertaining read. If you like drama mystery type books. I recommend it.  I will read more of his books after this one.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|As soon as I received this set in the mail I started watching. I have always been an Indy fan and this is by far the very best these movies have ever looked and sounded. I was specifically impressed with the sound as the soundtrack and little noises were very well spread out over my 7.1 surround system and I noticed things that I did not ever hear before.<br /><br />The extra disc is quite nice as well, giving a lot of detail and incite into the behind the scenes of some of my favorite movies.<br /><br />Even the lesser of the 4 movies, The Crystal Skull was still presented nicely in HD. I respect and appreciate all the Indiana Jones movies even if the sequels don't live up to Raiders. I like each one for different reasons, but just as the Alien movies, each one if very different and enjoyable in its own way.<br /><br />Very very highly recommended.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I was truly excited to see this film being a huge fan of alien and aliens (not the other two awful sequels) I realized this was not a sequel but a prequel of sorts and went in with an open mind.  I cannotl beleive ridley scott made this film. From the  opening  scene where the engineer drinks blcak goo and jumps in the water I knew I was in for a rough ride. I stayed with it showed some promise but things go downhill from when they awake from hyper sleep. The couple was terrible  flat, all the characters with the exception of the android are lifeless bland and the two guys stuck in the cave belonged in alien vs predator that bad.  Once again the backstory to the space jockeys is less interesting then keeping not knowing the mysterey in the first place.  The aliens were essentailly weapons which was fine and that you could prety much gather from watching alien, the space jockeys engineers are lame uniteresting human like muscular characters. Charlize thereon decides to bang the ships captain, the situations are cliched theres oxygen take off our masks!  Its all over the place convaluted mess,  peaking in naomi rapaces siginifcnt other being killed coming back as some weird zombie monster (WTF)? and then it totally derails, rapace gives birth to a worm like creature in a good scene,  horrible guy pearce makeup guy is on the ship secretly as yukatani, rapace kills her wormlike creature inside her but its still alive at the end end rapes one of the engineers (dont ask) and later a alien is born (wtf?) meanwhile rapace wants to go on exploring the engineers event though they want to destroy humanity. Its that bad I cannot believe scott touched this, if the bladerunner sequle is anything like this pleas eleave it alone!
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Steven Wilson is showing the most of his experimental side on his solo project. I got the impression that he can display his freedom more on this than with Porcupine Tree and Blackfield. By adding a lot more variety of keyboards sounds (mellotron, piano), sax and flute, we get more intriguing sounds that enchanted the music to something new and original. The 2 hours of music on this DVD is a journey through the mind of a genius that make you experience a wide range of atmosphere from the quiet part of a piano, the delicate vocals harmonies and the agression of a guitar exploding suddenly. Sometimes we are hearing the melancholic music of Blakfield, a lot of times, the heavy prog of Porcupine Tree, also, the mellotron, the sax and the flute take you back to the first King Crimson's era.<br /><br />The concert start slowly with some strange visual effects that are created with a curtain on the stage, that made the concert look like a old footage. The curtain is remove during the \\"Sectarian\\" song, so we can now have a clear view of all the members. And it seem to me that the show really takeoff here, with this excellent song. After the band go on to play some intense music, especially with \\"Postcard\\", the first time release track; \\"Luminol\\" and the epic, \\"Raider II\\".<br /><br />The DTS mix of Steven Wilson is another example of what his a perfect surround mix. The separation between all instruments is clear. You can hear different instruments in the rear speakers with a sound that is well balanced.<br /><br />This concert give you a new experience not only for the music, but for the visuals, very different from the Porcupine Tree's DVD. And it gets my highest recommendation!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! It adds some thought and spatial skills to a fun and  colorful game.  No complaints!  And you can get more challenged if you want.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|...and I've concluded it to be, after very much wanting it to be a classic, a severely flawed film.  Every aspect from the creature design to the dialogue was under par and should have been sharpened and scrutinized just a bit more for the dynasty's sake.  Seriously, Giger's designs were dark, disturbing and sexual and what were given here are rehashes from some 1950's 'attack of the squids' reject.  They don't move the series forward and damn, I really did want to be frightened by this film rather than roll my eyes.  Yes, The Alien series is a dynasty built on Scott's original vision that deserves a ton of respect.  Alien & Aliens are among my top favorites and Prometheus sits somewhere slightly above Alien 3 and 4.  Still, this film raises many very interesting questions and the visuals are quite excellent.  If only the rest could have fallen into place.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It was OK. Another post-apocalyptic thriller with minute revisions of the same old theme: Roman bread and circuses to calm the hordes, good poor folk, bad rich men. Reminded me of the TV show \\"Lost\\" except no fat guy. The girl, however, shot a mean arrow.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|No Spoilers!!!  As I watched Season 6, I felt like the writers were waiting, or were attempting to present a not really fully thought out story.  It seemed like there might have been a story there but somewhere along the way, it got lost and so they just presented a finale that would allow us to want to see more.  The acting is stellar and the characters are firmly established and Deb has always been a loose cannon but her story kind of freaked me out this season.  I'm happy with the finale & have high hopes for Season 7.
B0013TTLDE|3.0|I had a difficult time finishing this book.  I was looking forward to a period mystery set in rural England.  Many parts were slow and tedious.  The end redeemed the book, but I'm not sure I'd read another by this author.

0547564651|4.0|If your grandparent said to you \\"character counts\\", you'd probably just think that they're just passing on to you an age old cliche.  The author Paul Tough has written a book based almost exclusively on this theme.  But the odd thing is that in this day and age where a parent is in competition with video games, television, videos, and the list of distractions seems almost endless, it's easy to forget that grit, determination, and conscientiousness are key ingredients to the success of a great number of immigrants that entered this country starting almost back to the Declaration of Independence.  So, the novelty here is that it's linked to long term educational success.  Is this a surprise, I hope not.  Is it comforting that research outlined by Paul Tough in the field of psychology, child development, and education show that putting problem children on Prozac isn't the answer, I hope so.<br /><br />If all of this intrigues you, and perhaps you need a little boost on the important things in not only raising your own child, but also develop some understanding of possibilities to help the disadvantaged students, then this is a great book to read.  I found the first two chapters captivating, interesting, and thinking to myself how far off the rails the American culture has gotten with all the distractions for not only ourselves, but also our children.  But for poor children, the distractions are real violence and real home instability, something that is highlighted in this book.  The author provides examples of some pretty great people who have taken on the responsibility of building a future for children that left alone would have no hope of escaping their poverty.<br /><br />Why 4 stars?<br />The book started incredibly strong and slowly faded in substance and framework, and finally the last chapter almost seemed stream of conscious.  The chapter entitled \\"How To Think\\" was almost exclusively about chess and education.  If you read through my reviews you'll see that I'm a chess player.  I even played chess for a school mentioned in the book (back in the day!), but I found his development of the chapter not only without any real framework, but he really avoided the question that he raised in the title of the chapter, How to Think?  The United States Chess Federation sent out an email to all its members and highlighted the book as an example of the importance of chess in education, but I'm not so sure that even the slightest critical review would be convincing that it taught anyone to think.  So, I need to be clear, chess DOES help children develop critical thinking skills.  It teaches them to think both linearly (concretely) and nonlinearly (abstractly).  The real problem in the book is that the example of Elizabeth Vicary and her students is an excellent example of grit and determination (again, the first chapter) and not so much how to think.  He hits rock bottom when he gives examples of Gata Kamsky, many times US chess champion, dropping out of medical school and failing the bar exam!  What was he thinking in adding this example?  Susan Polgar is yet another example of the chess prodigy force fed chess by a father doing a social experiment.  And how is this relevant to normal child development and ways to teach critical thinking skills?  It's simply a swing and a miss by the author who was caught up in the feel good story of the Brooklyn public school that went to battle the polished, well-funded high schools and came away with the trophies.  And for the record, it's a wonderful story despite the fact that the author felt the need to delve into the personal affairs of Elizabeth Vicary who is the heroine of the chapter, but info on her engagement and subsequent marriage is completely superfluous to how children learn to think playing chess.  The real highlight of the chapter was related to some almost randomly placed quotes from the Scottish GM Rowson.  Hopefully, WHEN you read this book, and you should, you'll simply walk away from the section on chess and mentally note that having your child play chess will help them develop critical thinking skills.  And if you're really industrious, you'll find the many POSITIVE examples of how youth and chess have lead to great careers including Harvard economists, university professors, high-caliber software engineers and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />In summary, the importance of character is truly forgotten not only in education, but also in the workplace.  Grit, determination, and other skills to fight the many modern battles with adversity is more important than it ever was in the past.  As opportunities diminish (with a growing world economy), we need our children to have the grit and determination to develop great study habits leading to great work habits and as the author points out, puts them in a position to succeed in the future.<br /><br />This book is for just about anyone, period.  You might not be impressed with it from cover to cover, but it does carry an important and timeless message.  I hope that the message in this book is the start of a very positive trend and by reading this book, you'll find your place in either agreeing with it, or perhaps improving on the ideas.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Saw it twice in theater's and it has to be one of the best comic book movies ever made, Joss Whedon you know how to make good movies.  On blu-ray its just as awesome, the special features are great. The only issue i have is Amazon's price for it lowered after it shipped to me, that personally is a terrible way to do business. I know now not to ever pre-order from amazon.  The movie just came out today and its $5 cheaper, i feel cheated Amazon.  But its still an epic movie.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it!!! good game to play when there's nothing to do and my kids play it more than I do.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|The book is a series of very clear gems connected in a somewhat haphazard fashion.  He goes off on a tangent occasionally like a politician rambling on saying \\"and another thing . . . \\".  The information is there but the story line is vague.  All in all however, it is worth the effort.
B0063IH60K|3.0|When I first loaded this on my Kindle, the pop ups were few and you could \\"X\\" out of them, but the longer you play solitaire the pop ups are constant and you have no option of \\"X\\" out, so then you have to go back to \\"Home\\" and start again. This has become annoying, and I tried to load a different solitaire program, but I guess that is the only choice that is available. I haven't loaded any other games because of this situation. If there is a option that will reduce this, please let me know.

0679746323|4.0|I grew up in China when Mao was the ruler. The authors gave the truth to the world that Mao indeed was a monster and his shadow is still playing an evil role in today's Chinese politics. Anybody doubts the truth is naive and never experienced the horror that I myself experienced. Unfortunately, Chinese people inside China are still not getting the truth about this evil man.

0143119680|3.0|I could suspend my disbelief just enough for vampires and witches and magic and time travel and a whirlwind romance, but I couldn't do it quite enough to believe that the main character, Diana, was a prodigy--a highly awarded, well-respected, tenured professor of history at an Ivy League university. She spoke like a teenager, and between her constantly saying \\"Oh!\\" and \\"Really?\\" and being completely unable to draw conclusions from the evidence in front of her, I couldn't believe her character.<br /><br />This is probably just me. If this book were categorized as YA, if Diana had been a sixteen-year-old instead of a thirty-something, I probably would've given this four stars instead of three. If you can get past Diana's silliness, you'll find a whole host of characters with a tremendous amount of depth and a fascinating story steeped in history, science, and magic.<br /><br />It ends on a cliffhanger, and I'm kind of hoping that I'll forget about this enough to not have to read the next one. I don't think I can listen to Diana anymore.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read every Reacher novel Lee Child has written.  Although I thought it was the end of the series in \\"61 Hours\\", Reacher appears again, no explainations, nothing, except he is going to Virgina to find the voice that helped in \\"61 Hours\\".  The story line I guess is becoming predictable, but the price of e-books keep on soaring.  I hated paying the price for the book, but I even pre-ordered as I love the series and the character.  It was a let down on so many levels.  I can't help but think that Lee is writting for profit and not his faithful fan base.  If he keeps putting stories out like this he may find his fan base dwindling.  We don't even get an explaination on Reacher's broken nose.<br />That being said, the story gains momentum after the first 100 pages and again proves to be thrilling to the very end.  Reacher is the MAN.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Its seems to me that any Reacher novel just hits the mark! When mr. Child came up with 'Reacher', the literary community became that much better. What an amazing hero!

B0063IH60K|5.0|This operates seamlessly on Kindle Fire. The only distraction is the ads, which pop up before each game; each requires a different method to make them go away. Simple solution: I'm going to get the paid version. This game has proven it's worth the money!
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed the books. I bought them on my phone on Sunday and by Wednesday I had read all three books. I was unsure about the first few chapters until the relationship between Christian and Anastasia changes. When he really wants more that his normal relationships. I love the interaction between the two even the subject lines and signature blocks of their emails. These books were more than just steamy bedroom scenes the characters also had a good interaction and relationship. It inspired me to try and take care of myself more and share some fun ideas with my husband. I don't know if the author can have anymore books about these two characters, but I would love to read anything similar or other romance novels by her. I enjoyed the books and may even read them again!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The book started slow, but at the end, it really makes you think about the value of \\"time\\" and its many dimensions. Albom remains one of my favorite author because he doesn't just write a fiction, he inspires lives with his novels.
B002ZFOMAW|5.0|I was working for the Base Commander at an Air Force Base in Georgia when my boss asked me to call the Librarian and order the book. Being the typical \\"little ole lady\\" librarian, she told me, \\"Oh, no, I can't order that book because it's too naughty.\\"  When I told the Base Commander he said, \\"Tell her to order the ____ book!\\"  I did, but left out the _____ part. He was a speed reader and would finish a book in two or three hours (in his office)then had the opportunity to take my time reading all the best sellers he had read. Unfortunately, I missed reading this one until recently. Of course, it is certainly \\"mild\\" compared to \\"Fifty Shades of Grey!\\" I enjoyed the book more than I had expected I would.
B000UG4LYU|4.0|i like this album a lot more than Outside, the somewhat overcooked album he did after this one. Bowie was at a creative peak in the early to mid nineties. a stretch that went from 1992 Black Tie White Noise and ended with 1999's Hours. Originally, this wasn't even released in the U.S. until there was a Bowie reissue campaign around the time of his then-recent album, Earthling (i believe @ the time Bowie had just signed with Virgin)There's a healthy portion of instrumentals, which are quite good and some great vocal tracks too, like the original version of Strangers When We Meet (which later appeared on Outside, albeit a much different version), Sex And The Church, Bleed Like A Craze Dad, Ian Fish UK Heir, and the title track.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean is a must-have for developers who want a structured process to bring their creation to the marketplace.

B0084YAU86|5.0|If you enjoyed Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes mysteries, THIS is the show for you.  The intricacies of Doyle's super-sleuth are  inherent.  The writers have remained true to the original Sherlock with a modern twist.  I have yet to  be disappointed in any of the episodes and fervently pray for continued success and insight on the part of the producers of this series.  I have been known to hold family and friends hostage for an hour and a half to see this show.  I love Benedict Cumberbatch's version of this character.  He brings Sherlock  to life and and sneaks in a few moments of humor.<br />You will ENJOY! Richenback Falls is the original death of Sherlock Holmes.  Fortunately, Conan Doyle saw the wisdom in re in reincarnating Holmes.  The Rihenbach Falls episode in this show, also gives viewers the hope to continue watching Sherlock.  A smart, funny, and challenging show.

B005LAII7G|4.0|I was excited to see Dredd all summer long, but with awesome movies like The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers I wasn't going to let a potentially bad Dredd film ruin my summer. Then the reviews started coming in from the 2012 Comic-Con screening and they were almost all positive. I was starting to get excited again. Then Dredd was released in England and the reviews were extremely positive from fans and critics alike. I went in with modest expectations and Dredd blew me away. It was an absolutely insane mixture of action, dark humor, trippy visuals, electronic music (think John Carpenter meets Trent Reznor), cool future tech and great costuming. Dredd is better than expected and truly one of the coolest films to come along in many years. As much as I loved The Dark Knight Rises (saw it 4 times), Dredd may have more replay value due to it's memorable characters & action, epic gore and tight running time. Urban nails Dredd, Ma-Ma is a fantastic villian and Judge Anderson keeps things grounded. This movie is RoboCop meets Escape From New with a touch of Road Warrior thrown in for good measure. The poor US box office (people are morons) threatens the franchise but I suspect great word of mouth with put Dredd into the cult classic status very soon and we can hope for a sequel. If there is never a sequel, I'm thrilled we have this movie to rewatch for years to come.
B00513DGIO|5.0|The autor of this book has a very unnusual view about the history of money, it's very interesting see another point of view about the subject
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|For any fan of Mumford and Sons, this new album does not disappoint! Although their sound is pretty signature and recognizable, the lyric content is wonderful.
B001DCZ4IW|4.0|Harold and Maude is such an underestimated, not well known film. When I first saw this film, I felt as if I'd discovered something that had been hidden for years and years. There are several aspects of this film which could appeal to just about any movie watcher out there. This film is full of dark humor, historical fiction, love, identity crisis, rebellion and several other things. Great film.
B008YYCUES|5.0|I love this show.  I love the dynamic between Harvey and Litt and how Mike just seems to be unaffected by everything, even though he is skating on thin ice.

B008Y6QZ56|5.0|This was an intense movie. Not just because of the martial arts but because of the family turmoil and the lack of forgiveness. While many might be turned off by the brutality of the fighting, most will be able to identify the suffering and level of love it took to begin the healing of a lost family. This is definitely a high 4 plus star movie. I am actually getting ready to immediately watch it again, for the first time. Encore, Encore!

1936608898|5.0|I've been striving to eat Paleo for about a year and a half now and it wasn't until I read this book that I truly understood what \\"It\\" is all about.  The journey to a better you does \\"start with food\\".  I am so happy I read this book and I understand that now. Even though my 30 days have ended, I'm still living Whole30 because I'm too happy with the results to go back to my old eating habits. Using the information this book, my relationship with food has changed and I am able now to stick to healthier choices, even when tempting choices are in front of me. I love how the book gives the details if you want them, or the option to skip ahead if you want. I'm a details person, so I loved reading the science behind it. It is amazing what this program can do; this book tells you how to get there.
B008O037RG|4.0|I have listened to Mumford & Sons first album, Sigh No More, over 200 times. It's simply amazing. Of course, I couldn't help but compare Babel to their initial claim to fame. The first listen was OK. But I kept listening. I'm on my third play and I love it already. Yes, they chose to go with their tried and true sound. Things are repetative, chords are familier, song dynamics are fairly predictable, but this is truly a Mumford & Sons album. They really put out something nice here. I am tempted to say it's great, but not yet. Maybe after a few dozen listens.<br /><br />About the vinyl release:<br />Nice gatefold cover. LP slip has lyrics printed out, which I am thankful for. Includes download of 320kbps needledrop from test pressing. This sounds comprable to iTunes release, ie., no where near as good as vinyl. The record itself is quite thick and substantial, measuring about 1/4\\" wider than most LPs. Dynamic range is spectacular. It sounds very good.<br /><br />EDIT--<br />On MP3 quality: I've listened to the MP3s about 6 or 7 times. There are about 5 pops, audio dropouts, sound errors, whatever. I decided to listen to the iTunes Deluxe album today and am very happy I have the 320MP3s. The iTunes mix is terrible! If you're planning on getting a digital download, I would recommend you just go ahead and order the vinyl. Even if you can't play the record, you will have the best mixed MP3s available and a really nice gatefold album to display.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|Four years since The Killers's previous effort (2008's [[ASIN:B001FWRZ46 Day & Age]]) the quartet return with 2012's [[ASIN:B00973DDN2 Battle Born]]. 2008's Day & Age showed a lofty level of maturity by the band, delivering arguably their best album. Single \\"Human\\" was lauded if for nothing more than its grammatical incorrectness (\\"Are we human/or are we dancer\\") while closing cut \\"Goodnight Travel Well\\" was one of the most epic 7 minutes, `evah.'  2012's Battle Born delivers nothing short of top-notch quality;  the songwriting and cohesiveness of the album makes this effort arguably their best work. Battle Born is completely devoid of filler.<br /><br />\\"Flesh And Bone\\" opens Battle Born superbly, firmly invested in neo- New wave sensibility.  Brandon Flowers sounds phenomenally polished and delivers the  lofty subject matter of the  first verse capably (\\"...This natural selection picked me out to be/a dark horse running in a fantasy...\\"). Flowers sells the chorus flawlessly: \\"...Am I running out of time? Flesh and bone/And what are you made of/Flesh and bone/Man I'm turning on a dime/Flesh and Bone...\\" Well produced (Steve Lillywhite, Damian Taylor), Battle Born begins with a bang.<br /><br />\\"Runaways\\" delivers another valedictory moment characterized by an edgier, rock sound taken directly from the 1980s. Flowers sounds `full throttle' rock star by the end. The music is awesome blending acoustic guitar, pummeling drums, and tasteful keyboard synths.\\"  The gargantuan chorus confirms the greatness: \\"...Ain't we all just runaways/I knew it when I met you/I'm not gonna let you Runaway/I knew it when I had you/I wasn't letting go...\\"<br /><br />\\"The Way It Was,\\" produced by Brendan O'Brien, possesses an optimistic sound and some Sting and The Police sensibility. Flowers remains on autopilot. \\"Here With Me\\" supersedes \\"The Way It Was\\" if for no other reason than its chivalrous songwriting. Highlighting is the exceptional chorus (\\"Don't want your picture on my cell phone/I want you here with me/don't need those memories in my head no/I want you here with me...) and sound bridge section.<br /><br />\\"A Matter of Time,\\" another fine cut, finds the band fully invested into New wave stylistic cues. Follow-up \\"Deadlines and Commitments,\\" finds Brandon Flowers honing in on his falsetto, contrasting grittier vocals from earlier.  Superb songwriting and a solid, buttressing rhythmic groove makes \\"Deadlines and Commitments\\" as consistent and everything else.<br /><br />\\"Miss Atomic Bomb,\\"  produced by Stuart Price, yields a sound similar to \\"Human\\" though by no means copy-cat. \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" is less accomplished than its comparison cut, but not by much.  \\"The Rising Tide\\" keeps the production `in-house'. It continues to build a arsenal solid `role playing' songs, even if it fails to top the best.  Plenty of positives reside here including the dirty timbre of the electric guitar solo, lyrical prowess, and the harmonic underpinnings.<br /><br />\\"Heart of A Girl\\" adds the Las Vegas Master Singers on background vocals.  Initially restrained, the cut paces its way to be more overt and intense. \\"Heart Of A Girl\\" is classified as `second tier,' only because of stiff competition on this affair.<br /><br />\\"From Here On Out\\" delivers a KO punch in a brief 2:30 duration.  The tempo is quick while  New Wave is supplanted with country-rock.  Flowers cycles agilely through the lyrics of the quick-paced chorus: \\"Hey, from here on out/Friends are going to be hard to come by/left to wonder what it all was about/he had it easy then he chose the hard way...\\" \\"From Here On Out\\" is stellar.<br /><br />\\"Be Still\\" follows-up strongly, highlighted through its blend of real, acoustic and synthetic instruments flawlessly.  Closer \\"Battle Born\\" doesn't disappoint, featuring keyboards/programming (Damian Taylor), violins, and background vocals (Las Vegas Master Singers).  Solid and a welcome contrast to \\"Goodnight Travel Well,\\" it falls short of say \\"Runaways\\" (most tracks would).<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00973DDN2 Battle Born]] is one of 2012's best rock (be picky and say Alternative if you wish) releases. The production is excellent, the songwriting sharp, and frontman Flowers is `on fire.' Few things to trivialize,  Battle Born is Grammy worthy, delivering arguably the Vegas quartet's best album to date.most tracks would).<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00973DDN2 Battle Born]] is one of 2012's best rock (be picky and say Alternative if you wish) releases.

B007U4DIM6|5.0|This is a good family film.  The dogs are amazing!  How on earth did they ever teach them to talk?  And play classical piano?  There were so many different breeds and the little outfits were so cute.  The chihuahua family and their human family are living and working at a prestigious canine hotel where they have other doggie friends and many adventures.  I liked that the parents were not portrayed as bumbling idiots as they so often are.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is the best of the 3 Chihuahua films.
B008NW67E0|4.0|Mumford & Sons 2012 effort [[ASIN:B008NW67E0 Babel]] is easily one of the year's most anticipated efforts. A solid album overall, first time Mumford & Sons fan may enjoy Babel `better' than the most invested fans; more invested fans may pinpoint Babel as `formulaic' and `safe' rather than innovative.  Arguments presented, Babel is sure-fire commercial hit that may not necessarily `progress' the band's artistry to `the next level' as expected. A superb group of musicians, as good as Babel is, it may be ever so slightly humbler than the hype.<br /><br />Opener \\"Babel\\" is characterized by Mumford & Sons's `rhythmic machine' (acoustic guitar, banjo) and set in six-eight time.  Ben Lovett's piano provides a chordal foundation, preempting  contrast from Marcus Mumford's gritty vocals in favor of smoother, more melodic-centered vocals.  \\"Babel\\" is ultimately well conceived; it ends with cliffhanging airy pad segueing into \\"Whispers in the Dark.\\"<br /><br />\\"Whispers in the Dark\\" possesses constant rhythmic motion throughout the verses, though it is softer allowing for Marcus's vocals to shine without strain.  `Wall of sound' vocals aid in giving the record an inviting timbre, committed to folk. \\"Whispers\\" is less emotionally dynamic than \\"Babel\\" however.<br /><br />\\"I Will Wait\\" receives valedictory honors easily.  Highlights include supporting vocal harmonizations as well as sound vocal production overall.  Songwriting is superb by all means.  Add excellent pacing with an eventual fruition of production including piercing horns and \\"I Will Wait\\" seems a shoe-in for Grammy nominations (Record and/or Song of the Year).<br /><br />\\"Holland Road\\" keeps Mumford & Sons on `autopilot.' The harmonic scheme is similar to \\"I Will Wait,\\" while the pace is slower, a stark contrast.  Mumford's vocals are emotional and sincere.  Add a splash of brass and \\"Holland Road\\" is easily on the same plane as \\"Babel\\" or \\"I Will Wait.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ghost That We Knew\\" comes off shy of the level of the aforementioned \\"Babel,\\" \\"I Will Wait\\" or \\"Holland Road,\\" but delivers sound songwriting, most notably on the chorus: \\"So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light/Cause oh that gave me such  a fright...\\" There is not too much to trivialize, save for  some `predictability' (the unwinding ending) and length at nearly six minutes.<br /><br />\\"Lover of the Light,\\" takes a subtle approach prior to Mumford `letting it rip.'  The melody highlights and is clearly discernible.  \\"Lover of the Light\\" benefits its chorus, much like \\"Ghost...\\" did: \\"But love the one you hold/and I'll be your goal/to have and to hold/A lover of the light.\\" The instrumental timbres within the production add to a list of positives.  Even so, the cut is a bit lengthy.<br />\\"Lovers' Eyes\\" delivers a well-paced, well thought out cut. Vocal production is clear and Mumford's lead vocals sincere as he references religion, forgiveness, and love: \\"Cuz I feel numb beneath your tongue/your strength just makes me feel less strong/do not ask the price I pay for I must live with my quiet rage...\\" Mumford's overt outro seals the deal: \\"But I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow/take my hand, help me on my way...\\" As Al Green would put it, \\"Simply Beautiful.\\"<br /><br />\\"Reminder\\" gives the listener a simple, brief cut at 2:04.  Not among the `elite,' it is a solid and lovely showing.  \\"Hopeless Wanderer,\\" lacks little `unpredictability' here, which hurts its cause.  With the `deck of cards' revealed, this is a solid track where one desires a bit more `shake up' within the formula.<br /><br />\\"Broken Crown\\" is the best  of the quartet then closes Babel. Horns tighten up sound even if it follows a similar formula.  \\"Broken Crown\\" lifts some \\"Little Lion Man\\" swag by dropping the f-bomb within the chorus if nothing else. \\"Below My Feet\\" delivers nothing new per say while closing cut \\"Not With Haste\\" is solid, though average compared against juggernaut \\"I Will Wait.\\" The Deluxe edition tacks on three bonuscuts (\\"For Those Below,\\" \\"The Boxer\\" featuring Jerry Douglas and Paul Simon, and \\"Where Are You Now\\"), bringing the total number of songs to fifteen.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B008NW67E0 Babel]] is a solid, enjoyable album. It could potentially land multiple Grammy nominations (just made the submission deadline), even as lofty as the coveted `Album of the Year.' That said,  Babel is not necessarily `THE best album' I've personally reviewed this year, but contains the sensibilities and `cadences' of what the Recording Academy likes for sure. The biggest quibbles personally are that the band can/should take more risks instead of clinging to safety and `formulaic' means.  The perceptible predictability could be easily eradicated with minor changes and `tricks.' Babel gets it done, but album no. 3 needs to `take the next step'; 3 ½ Stars.cuts (\\"For Those Below,\\" \\"The Boxer\\" featuring Jerry Douglas and Paul Simon, and \\"Where Are You Now\\"), bringing the total number of songs to fifteen.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B008NW67E0 Babel]] is a solid, enjoyable album.

The perceptible predictability could be easily eradicated with minor changes and `tricks.' Babel gets it done, but album no. 3 needs to `take the next step'; 3 ½ Stars.
B00005JOA0|4.0|I just finished reading Anne Bronte's Tenant of Wildfell Hall and of course, had to watch the film.  I was not disappointed although a short miniseries never really covers a novel in the most comprehensive way.  There were also a lot of liberties taken to make it more palatable for the viewing audience--some bedroom scenes, wife abuse scenes, garden trysts, and so on.  Rupert Graves as the idle, irresponsible, conniving and cruel Arthur Huntington was spot on in this role.  He even looked sinister with the kohl rimmed eyes giving off a malicious look. Toby Stephens as Gilbert Markham was depicted as the kind, country gentleman who also charms the local vicars daughter and is a loyal son, brother, and the type of guy who would always have your back.  The lovely Tara Fitzgerald was well cast as Helen, a very strong, principled woman who flees to Wildfell Hall to escape a very bad situation.  The cinemetography again courtesy of the BBC was wonderful in capturing those English landscapes and wonderful old houses.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|When Thor's mischievous brother, Loki, makes a deal with the alien race Chitauri to help them secure the Tesseract Cube so they can conquer the galaxy, the Earth suddenly falls into great peril. With even the powerful top secret agency S.H.I.E.L.D. having difficulty containing Loki, there is only one call S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury can make: Avengers Assemble!<br /><br />The team is gathered--Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye--set out to do battle with Loki and his alien cohorts. If they don't overcome their differences and learn to work together as a team, the Earth will fall and Loki will rule the planet.<br /><br />The Avengers brings together Earth's mightiest heroes to combat a force of evil so great they either stand together or fall together, with the fate of the planet--even the galaxy--hanging in the balance.<br /><br />The Avengers is a difficult movie to review, more so, give a proper rating to because this movie is very much black and white between its story and its presentation, so that said, I'm going to quickly go over both and you'll see where I'm coming from at the end.<br /><br />The story: This is a single-plot movie, very much an A-to-B narrative and incredibly simple--too simple. Aliens are coming, we need to stop them so we'll get the Avengers to do it. That's it. From a storytelling perspective, it's too simple and too predictable. Big bad guy, big good guy(s), let's fight, good guys win. The end.<br /><br />However, if you view The Avengers as an end cap/final act to all the movies leading up to it: Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man II, Thor, Captain America--then you have something that definitely serves its purpose and more or less let's each character shine for the same amount of time. In this case, a simple story works despite, um, the many continuity flaws from the previous movies (i.e. Thor somehow now able to come to Earth, which renders the ending of Thor's movie moot, Tony Stark called upon to be Iron Man in the Avengers despite being banned from doing so in Iron Man II, the characters communicating to each other without earpieces or any communication devices. Maybe they're telepathic?).<br /><br />The presentation: This movie is a nerd's dream come true from start to finish. Assemble your favorite superheroes--of which each were spotlighted in their own movies, almost--put them together and have them go toe-to-toe with a larger-than-life threat that will squash the planet if they don't come through.<br /><br />From an eye candy perspective, this movie nailed it. Huge battles, lots of explosions, combat action, hammer throwing, Hulk smashing, shield boomeranging, repulsors firing, arrows shooting, girl fists punching--yeah, it has it all.<br /><br />It's also very important to point out that the casting of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk was an amazing choice. I honestly wasn't too thrilled with the news when I first heard it, with Ruffalo being more a chick-flick romance guy, but he got the role done so well that if there's a spin-off, I hope he gets the job. He's definitely earned it.<br /><br />Chris Evans as Captain America--a Superman performance, which is good and brought a traditional superhero element to the team. As the running joke was throughout the movie, a little \\"old-fashioned\\" was what was needed.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man--do I really need to talk about this? He's the same Tony Stark from the first two movies, the only difference being he's mellowed out a bit because, despite his arrogance, he understands life isn't all about him and there's other people out there, too. This bit really comes through in this movie.<br /><br />Chris Helmsworth as Thor--bold, poetic, commanding, everything his character is supposed to be so kudos to him for carrying on with a great performance from the stand-alone movie.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye--I don't know much about the comic character other than he's like Green Arrow, but perhaps with a more military-mind-set, so I can't comment. Renner did sell me on Hawkeye though, but why couldn't they give him that awesome mask? Maybe in the sequel.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow--she really comes into her own in this flick because in Iron Man II, it was more a back-up appearance so we didn't know much about her. I'm glad she got the screen time she deserved and, come on, her fight scenes were fantastic.<br /><br />Tom Hiddleston as Loki--he's the bad guy you love to hate, the one that, even just looking at him, you want to punch in the face. I appreciated how Loki, to a degree, was a villain to sympathize with because of his exile, but you also get mad at him for being such a jerk about it.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury--an excellent portrayal of Samuel L. Jackson being Samuel L. Jasckon--but under a fictitious alias. Yeah.<br /><br />The Avengers is a solid good-times-turn-your-brain-off-action-fest that is great for escape and is recommended for that reason. As a spoiler warning, if you want just the action parts, start the movie around 30 minutes in.<br /><br />Honest assessment is 3.5 out of 5, but because it's the first movie of its kind and because of all the building up to it that has been going on since 2008, I'll give it a 4.h a more military-mind-set, so I can't comment.

B009DP9D6A|5.0|Contrary to popular belief, deadmau5 isn't your average sellout DJ. Yes, he has given permission to use his songs in pop culture (I'm looking at you, Jersey Shore), and the mau5head is a widely recognized symbol nowadays, but that's mainly due to his singles, read Ghosts N Stuff and Raise Your Weapon (which I consider great songs).<br /><br />Despite his breakthrough into mainstream acceptance, I can hardly call most of his songs \\"mainstream\\", by no means. If we just go back to his last albums (i.e. 4x4=12, which is my favorite album), you see that there are songs as Cthulhu Sleeps, which at 11:00 and using a repetitive sound progression is prone to annoy the masses, rather than entertain them.<br /><br />This new album I bought kind of scared. For Lack of a Better Name has both Ghosts and the masterpiece Strobe, but the rest of the songs are subpar. Still, I decided to buy it. What a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Superliminal is a heavy track. Fantastic, though a little repetitive.<br />Channel 42 is a highlight, but with Wolfgang Gartner it was foolish not to expect it, especially after Animal Rights. It's easily one of the best songs in the album, its upbeat and happy and has some nice drops, without being brutal.<br />The Veldt is fantastic as I already knew thanks to Youtube. Reminisces his slow tunes like the beginnings of Strobe and  Raise Your Weapon, but with vocals. The mix is very balanced and the vocals help those not into repetitive riffs.<br />Fn Pig as also there, a fantastic 8+ minute majestic piece with all the mood changes you could expect from a song. The buildup and the drops are orchestrated fantastically. This is probably the best song in the album.<br />Professional Griefers, wow. That has some shoes  to fill, as the non vocal version was released a bit ago, and it made my car's side mirrors vibrate with the bass. One of my favorite overall mau5ongs, I feared Gerard would destroy it. Quite opposite, I find myself humming the song more and remembering the lyrics. It was a great choice, but I'll always cherish the original better.<br />Maths was another one released a bit ago. It is very happy as well, bouncy if you will. It's good and catchy.<br />There Might Be Coffee is fantastic. Great song development and the song is heavy but cheery. Another one of the best songs.<br />Take Care Of The Proper Paperwork is messy. It makes up for it near the middle, but it's definitely not noteworthy.<br />Closer is another great one. A slow, dreamy song with a cathcy high pitch riff, like a mix of Faxing Berlin with Slip, its a progressive jewel.<br />October is a song that builds up through most of its duration and never really explodes, which is kind of sad, but the atmospheric beat is very good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, only the first 10 songs are good. The last three are very poor, specifically Failbait. I guess you could enjoy Miscommunications, but I certainly didn't.<br /><br />Long Story Short:<br /><br />If you like deadmau5' work as full albums, this is definitely for you. The production is masterful and it's certainly the modern Joel you'll be listening to, no surprises there. If you just know a couple of songs, maybe use youtube to find out how his non singles sound like. If you enjoy songs like Faxing Berlin, Cthulhu Sleeps, Aural Psynapse and HR 8938 Cephei, you might consider buying this album.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|don't you know this is the best game in the world and I love the game loonies there how do you know
B008N5UX9M|2.0|I went into this with an open mind.  I wasn't expecting, or wanting, it to sound like Iron Maiden.  I was expecting something that would delve more into Steve's interest in progressive rock and other forms of hard rock / metal.  But this is somewhere between awful and generic.  It starts off with the muddled mess called \\"This Is My God\\".  I've heard demos from 10th generation cassettes that have better dynamics than this.  How this got past a competent producer is beyond me.  The production values pick up as the album moves along, but still range from muddy to thin and lifeless.  Did Kevin Shirley have a severe head cold while working on this?  Abysmal performance.<br /><br />The music itself is pretty generic.  Nothing really stands out or comes across as memorable.  I have literally 5,000 recordings in my collection, and I can only think of a few that are this bland.  Some of the songs sound like bad 90's \\"Bad Company\\" songs, a bit ballady, happy, and ultimately forgettable.  Take the worse song IM ever recorded with Blaze Bailey and you'd have the standout track on this album.  Seriously.<br /><br />And speaking of Blaze, the vocalist on this album would make him a bonafide vocal god!  I've never really written anything this cruel before, but the vocalist on this album is absolutely dreadful.  No dynamics, virtually no range, and worse than my tone deaf self could do.  Maybe given Steve's history with this group he felt a need to keep the singer, but loyalty isn't always the best choice.  Given a different, marginally competent singer, and maybe you could elevate this album to average.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as much as I would like to love this album, it's just plain bad.  Once again, I'm not looking for Iron Maiden, and would prefer it not to sound like that if it is a solo album.  But this is one of the few times I've regretted making a purchase.  I feel awful for saying that, but it's the truth.  Listen to the clips before purchasing and save yourself somemoney and time spent listening to something better.
B008QE9VJI|4.0|I don't know much about the original series of Dark Shadows, but after watching this movie it has made me question if I should consider it. First off, I love Tim Burton + Johnny Depp + Helena Bonham-Carter flicks like this. I'm not expecting it to be an epic script, yet I get the odd sense of humor those 3 + the other characters throw into every TB movie. The music was awesome, and I loved the Alice Cooper cameo. I like to diversity of the actors too. Eva Green was so far my favorite, even though she pissed me off through out the entire film, I thought she played Angelique perfectly! The story was fun and enjoyable, but I don't suggest you bring your children to watch this movie, thus the PG-13 rating. I give it a 4/5 because as some points things became slow/dull yet I was still entertained with the script.<br /><br />I don't understand why people would give this movie a 1/5 stars and think it's \\"completely trash to the original\\". As far as I heard, the original is boring, dull, and slow. Tim Burton mentioned it wasn't completely true to the original, and quite frankly I think he made it better for today's audience. The acting was suppost to be bad, to match the 1970's feel for that era in TV series. I'd love to see the original series after this movie cause I think it would be funny. So in my eyes, I don't think Dark Shadows has made any harmful stab to the original, I think they helped it become more recognized.<br /><br />I recommend you see this movie and keep an open mind and plenty of patience. :)
B0085A9HXS|5.0|The Raid: Redemption will floor you. That's the best way to describe it's effect on the viewer. The story is sorely underdeveloped, but the film makes up for it in spades with some of the best action, fight scenes, and stunt choreography put to film. It's nearly nonstop for the entire running time, and it's always awesome. Fans of action films looking for the next big thing should definitely pick this up. Don't let the fact that it's subtitled deter you (and remember to watch in the original language, not the godawful English dub track).

0671027344|3.0|Using a friends account<br /><br />Review of THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER<br />by Moslimah<br /><br />THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER is a coming-of-age novel, formatted as a series of letters that the protagonist, Charlie addresses to an unnamed friend that details his experiences in his freshman year.<br /><br />My feelings about this book are neutral. I neither liked it nor hated it. I felt that Charlie, the protagonist didn't was not believable but it was still interesting to read a story with a character who wasn't believable, if that makes any sense. Charlie is way too naïve and withdrawn and clueless and by the end of the book he doesn't really change. There is much in the book about his inner feelings but I found that I couldn't really care about everything he went through. I found that he was overly emotional and cried at the smallest of things. The other characters were not well-developed and I understand that that would be difficult when the book is made of letters but perhaps that suggests the book could have just been written in the form of a narrative. In short, all the characters are not memorable.<br /><br />If you enjoy opening up and reading a random someone's personal diary that includes all their misadventures, problems, moments of happiness and the small things they learn along the way, then you would enjoy this book. In other words, if you like being a bystander, you would enjoy this book. However, if you are a reader that wants to be affected by what you read then this book will not change your life in any little or big way nor will it make you see things differently.<br /><br />There was no real story to be found, just a large number of incidents all put together. In regards to the content, there was a huge amount of teenage issues included such as drugs, sex, rape, teenage pregnancy and abuse. These topics were not necessarily discussed and no conclusions were drawn. I guess that's okay since the book is a naïve, basic and one-sided view of the world, that is, Charlie's view. There were a little too many sexual references for my liking but those can also be overlooked.<br /><br />There is not much else I can say except that I hope the movie adaptation is better than the book.w of the world, that is, Charlie's view.

030758836X|5.0|Long have I been tired of the typical \\"run of the mill\\" female leads.  Long have I been tired of the same old plot lines and predictable endings.  Long have I been tired of the same types of men who are rich, handsome, and \\"perfect\\" to whomever they meet.  I wanted more substance, bite, and down right raw talent.  Needless to say, I was no impressed with the book mentioned in the title above and hope all copies of it are thrown off a cliff for no one else to ever waste their time on an extremely familiar, boring plot.<br /><br />When I first saw this book on the NY Times Best Seller list, I was intrigued.  I had heard about it also through a few Facebook friends and figured I'd reserve the book at my local Barnes and Noble store.  Boy, I really picked a winner and there's a reason why your friends (and mine) are talking about this book.<br /><br />I have always been a fan of mysteries and love trying to piece together how a crime was committed.  Even though I wasn't wise enough to do that with this book, it was still one of the best rides ever with some of the most fresh and intelligent story lines.<br /><br />You first meet Nick and Amy and the book (at least in Part One) seems like the normal \\"his-her perspectives\\" but don't let that fool you.  Nick's wife Amy goes missing and the case against Nick isn't looking all that encouraging.  I will not spoil the entire book but here is what I will say...<br /><br />1.  Be ready for your jaw to hit the floor, over and over again.<br />2.  Stop reading reviews and GO read the book NOW so you can know before many of your friends what \\"all the fuss is about\\" and say you were one of the \\"early birds\\"<br />3.  Throw Shades of Grey in the trash can (simply for my amusement)<br />4.  Have time to spare because once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down.<br />5.  You might *think* you know what's going to happen but, trust me, you have no idea<br /><br />Read Gone Girl..it'll be some of the most entertaining days of yourlife.  Also check out Gillian Flynn's other novels.  I know I will be doing just that in the coming weeks.

B005YVSIZ4|5.0|Rick is running with Shane and Otis and trying to get Carl to a farm house before he dies.  He was shot by Otis accidently while Otis was shooting a deer in the woods.  Rick, running like a madman, leaves Otis and Shane far behind and arrives at the farmhouse and asks for Hershel because Otis said he could possibly help Carl.  Carl is seriously injured. Shane and Otis finally arrive at the farm.<br /><br />The bullet was slowed by going through the deer and broke into 6 fragments. Carl has internal bleeding and a vessel is torn. They need to open him up and get 5 of the fragments as they are too deep to reach without killing Carl and the blood vessel needs to be closed. They need a respirator and surgical tools before they can operate. They have to go into town to a school to find the items to save Carl at a FEMA trailer that was set up.  Otis and Shane are going to go to the school.<br /><br />The group is separated into three parts with part of them at the farm house, part in the woods still looking for Sophia and part at the mobile home guarding it.<br /><br />Rick is the only source of blood for Carl and he gives so much and so often that he is weak and ready to pass out during most of this episode.  Meanwhile Shane and Otis go to the school to find it surrounded by over a hundred zombies wandering right where they need to go....<br /><br />This is a suspenseful episode and it is the set up for the balance of the season.  The farm may be a safe haven for the group but Rick isn't thinking about that as he is so worried about Carl.  Meanwhile the balance of the group is still either in the woods returning to the vehicles or at the mobile home.  Lori finally arrives at the farm house and is totally emotionally upset about Carl's serious wound.<br /><br />This is a suspenseful second episode to the season and it will keep you on the edge of your seat worrying about Carl and watching the scenarios that the other characters are in.  This is an important episode as it sets much of the ground work for the season and expands the characters by adding more people and delving deeper into their personalities.  I rate it as 5 stars and recommend it to you.sets much of the ground work for the season and expands the characters by adding more people and delving deeper into their personalities.

He stares into the mirror in a trance.<br /><br />Flashback to the school:  Shane and Otis are trying to find a way out of the building as the zombies are in the school now.  The zombies are in a frenzy. Otis and Shane are trapped in the gym on top of the closed bleachers. They decide to split up as Otis will never fit through the small window over their head so Otis jumps down and hurts his leg.  He finally makes it to a door and out of the gym.  Shane breaks out a window and starts climbing through it.  A zombie grabs Shane and he shoots him in the face and falls out of the window and down about 15 feet and hurts his leg also.<br /><br />Carl continues to worsen as he is still bleeding internally and they are waiting for the medical equipment as Shane and Otis are way late and they realize something must have happened.  The group is separated into four parts with part of them at the farm house, part in the woods still looking for Sophia, Shane and Otis are at the school and part at the mobile home guarding it.....<br /><br />This episode seems slower than some of the others but it really isn't the problem is that with the group divided into 4 separate locations the episode flashes back and forth between each group multiple times.  In addition there are several flashbacks in this episode.  As a result you are changing scenes, characters and time period every 2 or 3 minutes and it makes the presentation seem choppy.<br /><br />This is an important episode as it sets much of the ground work for the season and expands the characters by adding more people and delving deeper into their personalities.  The true spirit of Shane comes out and the inner conflict of the group is evident throughout this episode.  I still gave this episode a 5 star rating as it is so critical to the storyline.<br /><br />It is still one of the best series on TV and I recommend this to you as a good episode.d episode.

I was on an emotional roller coaster and I LOVED IT!<br /><br />The night I bought the book I read one chapter and put it down for the evening.  Then I decided to read a few on-line reviews...boy are there some bad ones!  The one that stated \\"I needed a bath to feel clean after finishing this book\\" really scared me.  What?  NO!  I want to like this book!  I have to like this book!  I just spent $12 (probably more, I can't remember) on this book!  What have I done?  So I picked it up again and read another chapter (more like 20) then I put it down (OK, so I dropped it when I fell asleep about two hours later).  The following evening after work I picked it up and later that night I finished!  And it was TOTALLY worth it!<br /><br />Ok, I don't want to spoil the book for anyone so quit reading now if you don't know how it ends....  Seriously, come on people, all books don't have a happy ending!  If you wanted a feel good happy story watch a Disney movie.  If you want a suspenseful mystery thriller, read this book!  No, it didn't have the ending I would have written, but then again, I am no writer!  I just love a book that keeps me guessing...hoping...and yes, even sometimes disappoints me!<br /><br />Keep and open mind and this book is well worth the money!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers is the best pure comic book super hero movie, end of story. For pure, full color action, character and humor this is it. The cast is great, the writing superb, the special effects amazing. Just an all around entertaining movie. I have made friends who have no interest in super heroes watch it and they love it!<br /><br />But, this is not a 1-star review for The Avengers, this is a 1-star review for how Amazon just treated loyal customers. Amazon puts the 4-disc set up for pre-order with a price guarantee that states until release day you will pay the lowest price. Then, the day after release, after they have already sold thousands of copies with that guarantee that ended the day before, they lower the price by nearly 33%. Way to spit in the face of loyal customers Amazon. And way to make me re-think my loyal years of ordering.<br /><br />Edit 9/27/12 Amazon has refunded the money to everyone. I would not have posted a negative review if they would have told me they were doing this when I first contacted them.

0525953728|5.0|I've really enjoyed reading this book and have struggled to put it down to go to bed because I wanted to know what happened next.  It isn't overly heavy on jargon and the author describes acronyms and the like as needed. If you're interested in military history, especially special operations, this is a worthwhile read.
