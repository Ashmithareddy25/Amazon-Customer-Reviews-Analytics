1439190275|3.0|Atkins has changed very little in the last 15 years.  I got a few ideas and suggestions from the updated information, but if you have the old books.. may as well stick with them.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book is well worth the $8 and couple of hours it will take you to read. If you're not interested in losing weight, then read it simply for the mountain of established scientific evidence it uncovers which debunks the junk science of modern nutritional advice (The Food Pyramid, low-fat/semi-starvation diets, and the calories in/calories out myth). I am willing to bet this book will change your perception of obesity, nutrition, and dieting.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it. this game is full of great stuff. it is the best free game that I have gotten in a long time.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|It was so good it was VERY hard to put down this book . This was the best book I ever read.I loved it and I mean loved this book!!!!!There is not 1 single thing that I would change about this book . For anyone who hasn't read this book I think you should read it and you should read it automatically.!!! So my point is read this book and read it NOW!!!!!!!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I have loved this book since I was a child! It is so good to read this almost timeless story from Louisa May Alcott. I have seen and recorded on VHS two different versions of this movie!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|My wife and i have been on the slow carb diet for a month and we are both down 10-15 lbs and are picking up speed. The wi fit no longer calls me overweight.<br /><br />I will be trying the muscle gain plan next.
034580404X|5.0|Exactly what I wanted! And expected, and definitely in a timely matter as well.  Happy to find these books here and for a great price, as they have been sold out everywhere!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Anna and Christian move ahead with the romance/lust-fest, it's hard to tell the difference.  Anna leaves Christian for a few days and he comes so undone, that he wants to change who he is completely.  Boy, do these two kids like drama or what?<br /><br />Well, I for one, just had to find out what happened in this crazy story of budding-submissive, and hunk-with-a-hurt-little-boy inside, so I picked up book two and settled in for more of Anna's deep thoughts(oh my), her inner goddess versus her subconscious, and to see if Christian pulled his proverbial head out of his very attractive hind end.<br /><br />To be fair, there was growth on Christian's end, and Anna did seem to grow more confident in herself.  But truly, what possessed the author to call this demon with a whip, Christian anyway?  And need I mention that Anna was Mary's mother in the Bible?  Crazy coincidences I'd say.<br /><br />Reading the Gray trilogy is a guilty pleasure in the same way all bodice ripping romance novels are, only this one is set in modern day, and has some things the reader can try out.  Is that the main attraction?  The writing is easy on the mind, though a bit repetitive at times. E.L. James does a fine job of giving us an intriguing story, and a how-to manual on some naughty things we might not hear about outside of a trashy mens' magazine.  This story is Twilight for grownups, and despite the 'playroom' a whole lot more wholesome.  Sex with the 'undead' still seems creepy to me no matter how 'hot' the lead character might be(I can't even remember his name anymore).<br /><br />I've heard that people are speculating about a baby boom nine months from when these books came out.  Now that's a sign of a well-read book.  Cheers to E.L. James for the best beach-book ever!
B0050VA428|4.0|I have not read this book yet. However, I did read this book as a junior in high school between the ages of 16 and 17 years of age. It was fascinating reading!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|just like the games on facebook but better and faster!! lots to work on and do in the game plus very interactive!!!
030758836X|5.0|The main female character in Gone Girl gets \\"the last word\\" in this novel.  With the diabolically clever set-up of her cheating husband,and her semi-plausible lies, she fakes her own death and almost gets him arrested, then falls for his (insincere) pleas to come back home, saving him from a murder charge, and committing murder herself in the process of her return. She gets out of that one too!  The book ends with a stalemate between husband and wife, each one having deep hatred and mistrust for the other. Yet somehow a \\"fatal attraction\\" and a pregnancy keep them bound together.  I would love to see a sequel in which the husband takes a page from his crazy wife's book and is calculating enough to bring her down and establish a life with their child, and another woman.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This book is a brutally honest,yet humorous look at a young woman's life. Her career and her personal life parallels so many of our own lives. It even has a happy ending!
B0009IOR6Q|1.0|This is an awful movie! Even Johnny Depp (and I'm a huge fan) could not save it. Depps' role is as bad as the picture and Traci Lords is wasted also. This is a must NOT see. The director has to be a total buffoon.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|so much fun. you will play this for hours its so addictive. if your looking for a fun game to waste some time this is for you
B00002616T|5.0|The four recordings by Keith Jarrett's European Quartet (Belonging, My Song, Personal Mountains, Nude Ants  (hope I got those all correct) are all absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />Also they play together very well if you string them together into a playlist on your computer or ipod.<br /><br />Belonging and Personal Mountains I haven't listened to enough to articulate what I like about them but I have listened to them enough to know I love them.<br /><br />My Song I had back when it came out and it is a collection of beautiful melodies.  Nude Ants is a live recording from Village Vanguard of grand works (Oasis, for example, I consider one of Jarrett's masterpieces), and Garbarek shows the full extent of his virtuosity on the wind instruments on that recording.  I have ordered some Garbarek recordings that have good reviews that I expect I am going to like also.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After hearing all the hype about this series I had to check it out.  I read a variety of genres so I was open to whatever it was, i.e. a romance novel, steamy novel, whatever.  What struck me early on is that this reads like a book written for someone in their early teens; that seemed odd given that it is intended to be provocative. If it was meant to be a steamy sex novel it fell short there too. The sex scenes, like the book itself, felt redundant and were lacking in something. The main character, Anastasia, often refers to her \\"internal goddess\\" and conscious which got annoying. Additionally, the majority of this book takes place in the northwestern part of the U.S., however there were key parts of the northern Oregon and Washington lifestyle that were missing making it feel like it took place anywhere, which would be fine except why mention cities if you are not familiar with the lifestyle there and the area really has nothing to do with the story. I thought the writing would get better but it didn't, it left me feeling unsatisfied and wanting more.  I don't think I will continue with this series, but I gave this 2 stars because it is an easy read and not one of the worst books I've ever read.
B005LAIGP0|1.0|Once again, my husband chose the Saturday night movie rental. I admit, \\"The Help\\" (my pick) was over-rated, but at least it had redeeming social value and historical relevance. Movies like The Woman in Black? Not a single interesting point. After all the hero's trouble to give the vicious dead woman what she wanted, we're left with the ol' \\"No good deed goes unpunished\\" message.<br /><br />Gratuitious violence, gore and fun-house scare tactics in scene after scene. Look out the window, see a scary ghost face staring back at you. If you want to feel like a kid on a sleepover trying to experience terror, this is safer than sneaking out of the house to jump off a bridge --and young adults today are actually doing this, and one died, not from the jump, but from the river bacteria that shot up her sinus cavities and slowly killed her.Yeah. I only wish I was making this up.<br /><br />So, stupid me, for the sake of cuddling beside my husband on the sofa for 90 minutes, I endured this stupid waste of good cinematography and movie sets. I wish I'd left the room and finished reading Jenna Blum's \\"the stormchasers,\\" best purchase all year from amazon, and left him with the cat, but the smooth-brained furball had the good sense to disappear instead of watching this idiotic movie. He's back now. (The cat.)I'm the one who has to bury those gruesome images before bedtime: the girl who swallowed lye, the drowned boy, the three girls leaping from the attic window, and that final scene, and if this is a spoiler, stop reading now, but did you really expect a happy ending? Stupid, pointless, stupid waste of time. Arrrghhh!!!! This is why I read the endings of books if, after a few chapters, I sense it's going to be a downer. If indeed the ending stinks, I'm 98% certain to drop the novel cold. (Dr. Zhivago was one exception, but that was 30 years ago.)<br /><br />If you really want to be scared, just read the newspaper.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Excellent page turner.  Very much recommended to anyone interested in unusual adventure.  I was expecting the story to be a bit 'young' for me, but found myself totally engrosed in it and simply couldnt put it down.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Man! you've got to play this game . It just has that feel of watching the movie all over again !
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The writing on this is overly simplistic and repetitive. I cannot comprehend how this is so well received.  I agree with the reviewers who indicated they were suspect that the writer was a teenager- the situations, language and context were so contrived as to be incomprehensible to the average adult.  I did not find the characters or their interactions interesting, and therefore their sexual interactions were not captivating, believable or arousing. Would not recommend this to anyone.
B007VTVGFQ|4.0|If your like me, someone that has been waiting years for Fiona apple to release a CD, this deluxe version is for you. The notebook has her hand written lyrics to most of her new songs plus some crazy sketches by her lol. The music videos are from her live performance at SXSW 2012 and they alone are worth the extra couple of dollars. I wont give a review on the album cuz as per usual there is some controversy over whether people love it or hate it but if your a fan you will want to add this album to your collection. It is nice to know that there are still artists that write there own music and don't rely on auto-tune for everything. I am going to see her in concert soon and I cant wait!!
0606259090|1.0|I was warned but I didn't listen.  I had to try a sample to find out if the writing was really as bad as I'd heard.<br /><br />OMG, it's bad.  Really bad.  I think I've written enough words for this to qualify as a review.  I don't want to waste any more of my time on this book.
0307951529|5.0|I don't understand why some reviewers say there is no 'meat' to this book.  The entire book is packed with real-life examples, and yes, it does include struggles and challenges they faced and overcame.  When you want to learn how to do something, you read about how other people found ways to be successful - not a book of how people struggled and failed.  Yes, it's inspiring, but it is also compelling evidence that maybe it actually isn't that hard to repeat this formula and find your own success.  I personally found this to be a better read than \\"Four-Hour Workweek,\\" because this one focused more on the business and the hard work aspect, allowing what you do with subsequent success to be left up to you.  I expect to read this again, and would highly recommend it to my friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|Wow. Some people really don't like this app. I played temple run on my aunt's kindle fire. This game rocks. I don't get that some people have a hard time with temple run. It's fine. Really. You should at least try temple run.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|I have been eyeing this book for months.Every trip to the airport had me picking it up, flipping through, and putting it back down. Finally I caved in and I am so glad I did. It was funny, poignant, inspiring, and heartbreaking. I loved it save for a little messiness in the last few chapters. I forgive the author because the chapters preceeding where that good. I would encourage people to read this book.
1466401885|1.0|I have know earthly idea how this book is rated so high. What is wrong with women????? This is not healthy and is not love!! The main male character in this book is controlling, and psychotic. This book is an awful story about a very unhealthy, sick obsession that is made out to look like love. I hope young women don't read this and think that this is what love is supposed to be like. It ties a big bow on co-dependency. Also, it makes it seem as if violence is ok, how can \\"Travis\\" get away with punching anyone he wants, especially on a college campus and get away with it. No one calls the police? The next step is that he will be hitting \\"pidge\\". Skip this book. Not to mention how terribly it is written.
1469984202|5.0|I got a BN Nook tablet for my birthday and started looking around for an ebook to begin my new reading experience.  I am an occasional sci-fi reader.  I has to be good and believable.  I happened upon Wool Part one.  99 cents.  How could I go wrong.  The sample reeled me in.  Well I couldn't stop reading Part One.  When I finished it, I needed more.  There was Wool Omnibus.  Wow.  It was great.  Could not stop reading again.  The concepts are believable.  The characters are nicely developed.  The story is very capturing.  There are many surprises.<br /><br />I never rate or review what I read.  But I wanted others to discover Hugh Howey.  You don't have to be a sci-fi freak to love this one.  It is great.  I am now reading Part Six.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This book was referred to me by a friend.  Upon reading page2 1 and 2, I wasn't enthralled.  I thought this was some mystical book that really wasn't appealing to me and my beliefs. However, I persisted and it began to make sense.  The analogies were just that... analogies for principles with a deeper meaning.  I highlighted many sentences in this book for future reference.  I need to meditate on these words. And, this was a QUICK read!
0802798225|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!! if you like romantic books, like nicholas sparks books, with ups and downs in a relationships.. its not like a fall in love with no obstacles, and live happily every after books.. they have challenges and they overcome them.. this book OMG, makes your insides melt... makes you want a hot spicy amazing relationship like that.. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE! ALL 3 BOOKS ARE AMAZING OF THIS SERIES!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game. I can play over and over. I recommend it. much better than one I use to play in school.
B0086T71MM|5.0|So easy to sign up, purchase and view. Love it. New favorite way to catch up with missed episodes of my favorite tv shows.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great game!!!!!!!! =] hope your up for a challange and hope you have paitents! Cuz a lot of these games are hard and come with great aggravation!
1449416950|5.0|I was getting bored of looking at the monochromatic corporate calendar that my company gives out each year, so I wanted to find a replacement that would liven up my office a bit.  This Dilbert calendar is large enough for me to easily see the dates from my desk about four feet away.  It is printed on good quality heavy stock and is certainly brightly colored.  I love the variety of colors - nothing too feminine or masculine.  Just the right amount of punch to give a boring corner a nice splash of color.  The strips are also funny and a cheerful addition to an otherwise drab office environment.  Good conversation piece too for visiting co-workers.<br /><br />I didn't buy this calendar to \\"collect\\" the best of Dilbert, so I don't really understand the other reviewers' comments about how this version is \\"cheapened\\" due to omission of the Sunday 8-panel strips.  It probably would've been nice to have, but I still really enjoy what I actually purchased it for:  a great looking calendar that I can see from my desk, and a little bit of workplace humor to boot.<br /><br />I'll definitely order next year's Dilbert wall calendar.
B0058UXHHK|3.0|Rose was likable character and I enjoyed her solving the mystery of her mother's murder.  It did seems to be a little unrealistic that a woman of her age was still a virgin, had no cell phone, no internet, and still lived at home with her mother. I would read the next books in the series if they were free also.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|This was an excellent purchase.  I have a couple of the Batman movies separately, but I like having them all together in one package.  Also, couldn't beat the price!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! It is a great way to kill some time. But it does ask you to buy items sometimes which can get annoying. But all in all still great.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible application. I love how it gives you multiple versions, reading plans, devotionals, etc.  There are family oriented devotionals, ones for women, kiddos, men.  Will send you little messages reminding you to do your daily readings.  Great!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love this game<br />it very fun<br />the graphic and effect are the best<br />hope to see more games like it
B002PMV9FG|4.0|My husband and I love this series as much as our kids have. We have read the books and watched all the movies. As well as played all the video games. Usually a story looses its momentum after the first couple books. Then it looses some more when its switched to film. This series didn't loose anything.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy this application ... I have two young children who are beginner readers so to have it read it for them (better than monotone)  is more then I could ask for. thank you!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am in love with these books. I cannot wait for more. The book was impossible to put down. Definately recommend.
B004LWZW42|5.0|A must-see for fans of the genre. I think it's a vast improvement over X2 and X3 (and *definitely* over that Wolverine: Origins crap). Great intro to many of the classic X-Men characters.
030758836X|1.0|I could not wait for this book to come out.  I do not know why.  I could not get into this book.  Maybe it was me but I just couldn't.  AND because of all the stars I did a bad thing and read the last two chapters.  All I can say is, I guess I'm not a fan of Gillian Flynn.  I tried to read one of her other books before this one came out and neither grabbed me.  I'm too old and there are too many good books that if they can't grab me by 25% through the book...I stop.  It wasn't for me. Maybe something happened between the 25% and the end that has everyone cheering but I wouldn't bother.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm loving this game. I play it with my 5 year old before we go to bed. Somehow I end up playing by myself for hours.
B00000JPH6|5.0|was received in great shape.... watched as soon as I got the package and it was received quickly :) more words are needed
0525478817|5.0|The author grabs your attention and keeps you drawn in. I loved this book and read it all in one sitting. It will make you laugh and the end will make you cry like a baby. Look forward to reading more books by this author. Buy it- you won't be disappointed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The book is well-paced throughout and quite enjoyable to read. Wool describes a vividly imaginable dystopian future with a strong emphasis on the characters and their cultural milieu.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I enjoy this game.  I only wish there was a way to earn cash with your coins.  But its a great kid friendly game that the kids and I enjoy.
6305095442|4.0|This movie fits in well with my horror collection. Definitely! This movie even came out three years before I was even born. I'm 21 now and I most certainly got a kick out of it! The main character is such a Bad-A, he's so cool! I recommend this for any horror movie collectors looking for a thrill! ^^
6305313687|5.0|Watch this film for studies in culture, racism, and societal influences. This is a thought provoking film that I highly recommend. Edward Norton's acting in this film is superb. The supporting roles are also played very well.
B003Q6D282|5.0|I am a huge fan of the SAW franchise.  This one did not disappoint!  I love that the SAW movies are intellectual films in disguise as horror movies.  Excellent storyline to keep you riveted throughout.  Great purchase for sure!
B0020TS5LK|1.0|I was very excited to get this movie on blu-ray since it is one of my favorite vampire movies and man was it a let down. I've had the dvd version of this movie for years and I sold that copy to get it on blu-ray and was in for quite a shock. The transfer looked worse than a dvd and the big kick in the face is that it isn't even in widescreen!!! WTF!! I have never bought a blu-ray where they took the original widescreen version and made it a pan and scan version. This is just unacceptable!!!! I guess that I will just have to go back and buy the dvd version. Stay away from this blu-ray release at all cost!!!
0679805273|4.0|I bought two of these books as a graduation gift for my kids, I will have the teachers sign them every year they go to school and give it to them when they graduate.  I love this story, makes you want to dream big!  The reason why I rated it 4 out of 5, was due to shipping.  The books came in the estimated time from amazon, however one of the books corners is dented, not too bad, but noticeable.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I got the cd that i wanted but when I tried to rip it to my computer it came up as maximum nickelback, dont get me wrong I love the songs but when your trying to do thing on your computer and you buy a cd it should be what you order...

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Great app. it keeps all my notes, grocery list and remainders. I also used it to get notes for my wedding.

B0071WQ7WU|1.0|I really like their first two CD's which were more strong and  complex in my opinion.  I think they are starting to stray from what made them so different.  This latest CD is kind of basic and seems to be directed at a broader audience, too bad.  Maybe with the two newer members they have lost their way.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app it's fun  and easy to use. I know people say apps are addictive but this one really is! and it's free!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addictive I love playing it. I bought this because I needed a fun game for free this was definately it. I play this on my kindle and it is great for my entire family.
1849531986|5.0|This is a hysterical gift - the back details this incredible journey into the make psyche and then viola - absolutely blank - works out as a great journal or day planner after the fun of the punch line.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I messes with it. Has its small mess ups here and there but it works just fine for me. I recommend it for anyone who writes whether it be for fun, business, or a way to relieve stress... In writing.
B0055S348W|5.0|Works great for me on all OSes up to Ice Cream Sandwich. Doesn't work with the new Jelly Bean. It can't find its files on the SD card because it's hard coded to look in mnt/sdcard which no longer exists. PLEASE FIX IT SOON, I miss being able to print.<br /><br />Edit: And a week later, they updated it, and it works fine on all my Android devices now, including my brand new Nexus 10 tablet with Jelly Bean 4.2.1.
B006R1T40I|4.0|not her best effort but all in all a very good album. raitt fans will have to have it. i have the complete collection.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I recently purchased the Alien Anthology on Blu-Ray.  When it arrived, I was immediately disappointed to discover it has the same horrible \\"book\\" case as my Star Wars Blu-Ray collection. The \\"protective\\" case is supposed to look like a book, unfortunately the \\"pages\\" are what you slide the Blu-Ray disc into.  They are glossy cardboard envelopes.  This means, the more you watch and enjoy the product, the greater the chance you will scratch and ruin it sliding it into, or out of, it's case.<br /><br />The actual movies are amazing.  I am only taking one star off for 20th Century Fox's horrible case design.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I really really wish this game was free.... my cousin has it and she loves it. but it sometimes freezes and u have to restart the whole thing!!!! :/ all the progress u made is gone. I was about to have a break down.... please fix this.the game oz super fun and adventuress though and I would buy it IF these deafaults were fixed :) ok that's all....
B00884GR0W|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME!!!this is almost just like minecraft. I hope the pocket edition of the regular minecraft comes to kindle. but still this is awesome. just look at the title. awesome.
B0086700CM|5.0|NOW LISTEN! EVERYONE WHO IS SAYIN IT CRASHES BORING ETC U PPL R SOOOO WRONG!!!

HER SCORE 1000000 SHE IS BETTER THAN ME LOL
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Krugman at his best. A voice of sanity amid the hyper-partisan rhetoric in this year of the American election. He deftly punctures the prevailing conservative orthodoxy on \\"big government\\" and examines how cleverly the Republican party has managed to inflict economic amnesia on a confused electorate. My only complaint is his apparent dedication to unlimited economic  growth and expansion as a permanent solution to our social problems. Our present path of unlimited economic expansion is simply unsustainable in a finite world, and some sort of steady state economy must evolve. I wish Krugman and other like-minded economists would research and publish books, papers and articles on how such a society might evolve.
B0036BU69U|4.0|Im a big fan of the Terminator Franchise and so i bought this movie to go along with my collection.When the movie arrived the case was scratchy witch wasent exactly what i was looking for but long as the disk was ok i was ok over all good movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its sooooooooo much fun and get this my dad lost his keys in the cooler 1 2 3 4 5
0553582038|2.0|This book was a great disappointment to me.  I started reading the series because I got into the show in the last few episodes of the first season and wanted to understand the beginnings of the story.  The first three books were interesting, although some of Martin's writing tendencies started to get on my nerves (do we really need to know the banner design of every minor house, each of which appears once and is never seen again?).  Martin also has an aggravating habit of creating substories and minor characters that do nothing to advance the plot.  By the time I was part way through this book I just begain skimming each chapter to see if anything actually happened.  Most of the time the answer was no.<br /><br />I am afraid that Martin has fallen into the same trap that Robert Jordan did- thinking that your readers find the \\"world\\" you created as endlessly fascinating as you do, and focusing so much on that \\"world\\" that you forget to tell an interesting story.  At this point it seems like Martin has given up on actually telling a story and is just milking a concept.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I felt the need to read book 1 to see what all the craze is about as interviews with the author have been on all the current affairs tv shows here in NZ and follow up stories on how the trilogy is getting the country reading again. So I looked forward to seeing what 'mummy porn' is all about.<br /><br />It felt like a chore to finish the book. At the start I ignored the weak writing style hoping that ultra saucy scenes later on would make up for it. I'm no expert on erotica books (maybe they're all like this book, just like B-grade porn films have poor acting and no story), but the sex scenes felt they were lacking something and were very childish, which maybe you can say they should be because they're written in the first person by a character who starts out a virgin. But the sex scenes became more boring and incredulous (god I'm so sick of the character biting her damn lip, if she kept it up I'd be into giving her some punishment too, and a new ex-virgin orgasming at the drop of a hat..). Also the Dominant was not what I'd class as that particularly dominant either. The story and dominance scenes could have been much darker.<br /><br />As so many others have commented, it's like teenage fantasy writing. And the use of the word 'delicious' to describe everything from wine to steak or anything foodie - I'm no writer but I'm sure there is a better word to use, delicious is simply not the word to use to describe classy wine.<br /><br />I don't read many novels, not enough to call myself a critic by any means, but even I could not handle the weak childish writing style. I'm looking forward to reading some well-written gripping novel to restore my faith in fiction.
B00005JM0B|5.0|I never new there was a Terminator 3 till I started ordering the Terminator movies off of Amazon. I thought the first and second Terminator were great, but Terminator 3 is even better. I also have Terminator 4, haven't seen it yet. Looking forward to watching it with my husband with our dinner tonight. I hope it is just as good as Terminator 3 or even better.
B004I1K2NW|4.0|This movie is very entertaining. It's family oriented. It has all the element of a good movie. There are a lot of funny scenes as well as dramatic sceens. It has it all. The price was very fair. Mike Fox delivers and outstaning performance. Amazon is such a good place for movie deals.
0545265355|5.0|I absolutely love these books.  I am so glad I got it.  Finished reading it in 3 days.  Can't wait to see more books from the author.  I am now an official Suzanne Collins fan.
B00003CXFV|5.0|This DVD delivers on a whole new level of Corporate greed and lies. It actually epitomizes the same greed thatat corporations are doing to us today. Erin Brocovich takes these people to court and fights for the victims of corporate crime. This  is one sexy lady. A must have DVD for all Julia Roberts fans. It's a great buy.

B000MV90IU|5.0|This DVD is a must have for all Steve MCQueen fans. It's aclassic with a great chase scene that goes on for some time. The driving sequences are a classic with two of the most powerfull muscle cars of the era. Steve play a great cop and the mystery keeps you guessing. The price of the DVD is very fair. I rcccommend this movie to all action fans.

B004UJAYEY|5.0|It is difficult to download French books, if you own a kindle purchased with a US billing address for your AMAZON credit card.<br />I was pleased to be able to do so for a classic novel I read in my late teens.<br /><br />Stendhal est un des grand auteurs du XIX si&egrave;cle (avec Balzac, Flaubert, Victor Hugo, &Eacute;mile Zola). Ces auteurs commencent un nouveau genre de roman, le r&eacute;alisme en r&eacute;volte contre le romantisme.<br /><br />Le h&eacute;ros de ce roman, Julien Sorel, &eacute;chappe &agrave; son sort de futur charpentier.

0061122416|1.0|Please, don't waste your time. It is horribly written, boring, and uninspiring. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. There are SO MANY better ways to spend your time.
0345803485|5.0|I must say that this one incredible novel that I could not put down.  This book made me think about things in a positive way that I had never thought of doing... This book made me think and the author kept me on the edge of my seat... I laughed and cried...Thank you E L James for one novel that truly made me see the light of love...
0670858048|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  I bought it for my granddaughter and she loved it.  The artwork is amazing and the content imaginative. I recommend this book to people of all ages.
0545123291|4.0|Originally posted on Pawing Through Books on 4/25/12<br /><br />As far as an audiobook goes, Linger by Maggie Stiefvater is great.  I loved the people they chose to read for it and their voices fit the characters well.  I also listened to the audiobook of Shiver and loved that just as much!<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater is an amazing author and I loved Linger.  It is a great story of a boy and girl's romance and their struggles to make it work.  At the end of Shiver Sam has been cured and now life is great with since he is a human now and they don't have to worry about him changing anymore.  That is until Grace begins to defy her parents and starts keeping a secret from them and Sam.<br /><br />Throughout Linger we have a good idea what Grace's secret is and it isn't a big mystery; however, the story is still well written and intriguing.  We are left with an ending that is going to make you want to get your hands on Forever as soon as you can!<br /><br />Stiefvater has a way to draw you in and keep you captivated throughout the entire book.  You really feel for the characters and connect with them.  She writes in a way that makes you visualize the story in ways that make you feel like you are there.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Linger by Maggie Steifvater.  I have already downloaded the audio of Forever and I can't wait to listen to it to find out what happens with Grace & Sam next.

006197806X|5.0|Originally posted on Pawing Through Books on 6/27/12<br /><br />I loved Lauren Oliver's Delirium when I read it and Pandemonium did not disappoint.  Thankfully, it did not suffer from any sort of second book syndrome! Pandemonium is told in Lena's point of view, in the past and in the present.  Delirium ended with a cliffhanger and Pandemonium picks up right where it ended when Lena is speaking of the past.<br />At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like the fact that Pandemonium is set in the past and in the present.  However, it worked really well and I loved seeing how the story developed through the alternating time periods.<br />During Oliver's Pandemonium Lena struggles to bury her old self and find a way to survive in the wilds and help the resistance.  You are able to follow her through her struggles to survive, make friends, and find her place in this 'new world.'  We are left with another cliffhanger that will leave you longing to get your hands on Requiem.<br />Lauren Oliver's writing is captivating and you are easily brought to the Delirium world.  You are able to connect to the characters and develop a sense of what it would be like to be going through their struggles.<br />Overall, I loved Lauren Oliver's Pandemonium just as much as I loved Delirium.  I can't wait until Requiem is released to see how Lena's story ends.

0525423656|4.0|** spoiler alert ** Originally posted to Pawing Through Books on 4/18/12<br /><br />Crossed by Ally Condie is the second installment in the Matched trilogy. When I read Matched I fell in love with the characters and the love between Cassia and Ky. I was so excited to read the second one and couldn't wait to see what happened. I couldn't wait to find out if Cassia and Key found each other again and what struggles they had to go through to get there.<br /><br />Caution: Spoilers ahead!<br /><br />When I began reading Crossed I found that it was a slow start and I was hoping that it would pick up. Though there were parts that had a bit more action, the whole thing ended up being a bit slow. It focused a lot on Cassia & Ky's journeys to find each other again, with most of it taking place in the canyons. Honestly, it kind of seemed like it was a bit too easy for them to find each other. I was hoping for a bit more of a struggle and longing for each other than what happened. Once they found each other their journey continued to find the rebellion. There were points where their relationship was rocky and they were struggling to keep it together, but in the end was still strong.<br /><br />In the end, I felt like I wanted something more from Crossed. However, with that said I still enjoyed it. I loved the characters enough to still like the story and thought it was a decent read. I hope that the final installment of the Matched trilogy has a lot more action and ends the trilogy on as great a note as the first one.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I was suggested this book by a good friend.  When I started reading it I thought oh my, but I kept on reading.  It is one of the most awesome books I have ever read.  It is a book that needs to be read by everyone. I also recommend that you read it from front cover all the way to the very end.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is truly an excellent film version of Pride & Prejudice.  The scenery is lush, inviting and magical. The actors are perfect in every way.  Keira Knightley brings a new freshness and charm to the character of Miss Elizabeth Bennet through her infectious laughter and fearlessness.  Matthew Macfadyen, as  Mr. Darcy, is distant, frosty, vulnerable  and attractive all at the same time. Their combined energy makes the movie real and believable.  It's easy to become invested in the story and its outcome.  Be warned, however, one viewing of this great film will not be enough, so be prepared to watch it again and again.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|the game is awesome with fun missions and my favorite part is the free roam and web swinging from buildings and you dont need walls
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is a truly wonderful and delightful rendering of Pride and Prejudice.  It's Jane Austin meets the Twilight Zone...off-beat, with a touch of time travel, yet true to the story.  Highly recommended in every way. Notable is the scene where Mr Darcy, after dunking  himself in a pond, rises and walks slowly toward his beloved.  Easy to watch again and again and then a couple of times after that.
160094048X|5.0|Our family is vegan- no dead animals, no pus-laden cow secretions (dairy) , no bee vomit (honey) nor any chicken menstruation (eggs). All of that is not only associated with coronary artery disease, heart attacks, strokes, and various forms of cancer but involves animal abuse (we are rescuers including of farm animals) and is outright repulsive and gross.<br /><br />Enter vegan living and the amazing foods you eat. Thousands of delicious varieties of fruits, vegetables, grains, pastas, nuts, breads, seeds, and beans and unlimited ways of preparing them. There are so many vegan cookbooks and my goal is to own them all. As the administrator on several vegetarian/vegan pages on Facebook, I am always on the lookout for great new vegan cookbooks.<br /><br />My teenaged daughter discovered this book by our Facebook friend Isa and checked it out from the library repeatedly. As she baked her way though the book- literally making every single recipe- we enjoyed the most amazing cookies. My non-vegan father in law who hates cookies became a cookie freak when he sampled  some of these and is now always asking when we will be making more. I sent some to work with my husband and they wowed his non-vegan co-workers and boss who wanted the recipes and for us to make and send more. I know exactly what we'll be sending to every office party!<br /><br />These cookies are fantastic. Let me tell you about some of what is included.

Be forewarned if you buy this (as I did after we got tired of checking it out of the library and having to wait for the holds ahead of us) , you will attract cookie lovers to you like a magnet if you offer them the treats you will make from this book.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Never have I even thought to ask for money back for a book... Yes, I know I won't get it but this was a total waste of my time.  I was hoping that it will get better as I went along but it just went on with silliness...<br /><br />My guess is that this book is so popular because the Twilight fans have grown up a bit and needed a new fix of trash.  Yup, here it is.  It's not even a decent romance novel.<br /><br />It is the authors first book (and the last one I will read by her) and she'll probably go on writing junk for a long time to come.  By the way did anyone edit this book?
0679746048|3.0|Girl, Interrupted was a very clear book and an easy & fast read. I loved reading the medical charts throughout the book; it was interesting and something different to break up the text. I expected a lot more from it though. The chapters all seemed to be disconnected from each other which made the whole story seem disconnected too. It was more like several little memoirs combined to make a book. All in all, it was worth reading, but it didn't live up to all the praise I'd heard of it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game!! plus its free what do you have to lose? I downloaded it cause a friend of mine told me it was fun. now me an my dad can not put our kindles down! love this game so fun!!! lots to do.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have used this app on both an Apple and Android product. Overall it performs better on the Android.  The devotionals are great and the reading plans are easy to use. I have had this app for almost eight months and I use it everyday.  My only complaint is it occasionally errors out for no apparent reason and skips days on the reading plan if you aren't careful. I definitely recommend this app!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ladiessssss this book will have you In another zone, Sometimes whole reading it at work I had to look around and catch myself lol, enjoy

B007GNMJYE|5.0|Marina and her sophomore effort really hits every spot it should. The ideas she explores on this album transcend nicely, it's a nice growth from her first album. the second half though is where she really shines. I can't wait to see what more she will do in the years to come.
0062197258|2.0|after reading the reviews i was anxious to read this book.  It was totally boring and predictable.  Couldnt wait to finish it.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I just finished watching this movie. I have heard of the book but never read it. All I can say is I really tried to watch this and like it. I did. I like all sorts of spy movies. Flashy Tom Cruise ones, James Bond ones and ones like the Good Shepard. I have absolutely no idea what was going on in this VERY boring muddled movie. Twenty five minutes into the film I had to read the back cover of the box to see what it was about. Ten minutes later I started to nod off and wake up every five minutes or so. The other reviewers that knew what was going on clearly must have already read the book or seen the BBC series. What was that communist xmas party all about? The one they kept going back to that had all the spies at it? Characters seemed to just show up out of no where to fill a role and we were suppose to know who they were. Maybe because I kept falling asleep but I have no idea at all how the clues Oldman gathered added up to the person he ultimately decided was the spy. As far as I knew it could have been just as easily any of them. And why was the guy that was hanging around the kid so tortured all movie? What happened to all the others in the spy council at the end? Were they part of the plot? What?
B007U1FEJE|5.0|What a great album by America's Band. Production is sensational and once again, Brian steps up to the plate and hits a grand slam.
B002ZG97LK|2.0|I saw the original and loved it, but was curious about the remake.  The dance sequences are good, but that's about it.  The acting by the lead guy wasn't as good as Kevin Bacon was in the original, but then again Kevin Bacon became a big star and I can't remember the name of the guy in this.  Although I did hear that his main career is actually dancing, not acting.  He is an amazing dancer and its worth watching this for that.  However, the movie wasn't exciting enough to keep it afloat beyond the dancing.  I don't know how many towns ban dancing in America in this day and age.  It may seem outlandish for some to fathom while watching this.  Clearly you'd need to keep the suspension of disbelief.  Dennis Quaid is fantastic as the dad of one of the teen girls and seems to be the only cast member who is a gifted actor.  His wife is played by Andie MacDowell in a pointless role proving that in Hollywood once you reach a certain age you have to take these little thankless Mother roles just to keep working.  Other than the dancing and the good looking teen leads I can't imagine what anyone would find interesting in this.  I watched it once and that was enough.  In and out of my mind and forgotten.
0143119680|5.0|Spoilers here, so don't read if you're sensitive.  This is one of the best books I've ever read and I simply couldn't put it down.  I could gush on about every single thing about it, but I won't.  I will only say that if you like a good intelligent story, great characters, fantastic writing, and a total pager turner, read this book.<br /><br />My one (very small) criticism is that, although the characters fool around a bit, they don't consummate their relationship because Matthew wants to wait, even though they're madly in love, sleep together and are (sort of) married. That was kind of weird. I kept hoping Diana, as a modern woman, would make a crack about slipping Matthew some vampire viagra. But I still loved this book and can't wait for the sequel, which is coming out soon.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game i have it on my i pod and it awsome I totally love it and I love it for the kindle toooooooo
B0066W1AZK|4.0|its fun but it could be better there is other chess apps and there better because they count wins and losses

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This was exactly what I wanted. It has large buttons,  crisp graphics. It is a basic calculator, perfect for everyday use.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|We could not find this movie on Netflix and decided to purchase this DVD as it was more affordable to purchase the DVD than download and view, plus we knew we would want to watch this movie over and over. Which is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time.. This happen recently and 007 saved the day! We started watching and before we knew it, it was time to go on to our next destination.<br /><br />So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this movie. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great movies and are turning to movies like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like 007 so it is in demand!<br /><br />Anyway, our family loves this 007 and glad that we were still able to find this movie for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!<br /><br />I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the movies that we want like 007 etc since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this movie is available on Amazon.<br /><br />This movie entertains you with lots of action, turns and twist.. Miss those days of movies like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this movie is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this movies!<br /><br />We have re watched this movie so many times and we are still not tired of this movie.. Every time we watch we are still amazed.<br /><br />We love the cars, Daniel Craig! the action, the scenes are so beautiful! This movie is full of surprises and will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more and more! This is perfect for our movie night! This movie is refreshing! Stunning acting from all characters!<br /><br />Well back to 007! I even have 007 as my ring tone!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it! thanks for the tip on how to go back home. gotta go its time for my egg to hatch!

B005LAIGZU|5.0|This movie is the most accurate and realistic film to date concerning the Special Operations community.  With the major characters being portrayed by actual active duty SEAL operators, there is no doubt on the authenticity of the actions depicted.  A huge debt is owed by the American people to the U.S. Tier One forces deployed across the world.  A must see film for all.
B005MQW5RI|4.0|This story is what would happen if you took the first Superman movie (Christopher Reeves) and turned it on it's head.  I trust I'm not giving too much away in saying that Megamind (Lex Luthur), is forced to take a hard look at himself, and make some choices.  Lot's of comedy, and some original characters.  Our bad,(bad) guy reminds me of the bad guy from the Incredibles.  The 3D was pretty good too, not as good as Puss 'n Boots, but pretty good.
0606259090|2.0|As someone who has read many erotic novels, this one fails the reader in so many ways.<br /><br />1.) This is not an EROTIC description of BDSM.  The writer has not done her homework. BDSM is a loving relationship between two individuals, who WANT a relationship with another person sharing an exchange of power. They are not two dysfunctional people trying out this lifestyle as a way to solve problems from their past or experience something in which they are unsure of. The submissive WILLINGLY, not RELUCTANTLY, gives up control to the Dominant because it satisfies BOTH their needs. The submissive has the control in the relationship and is given a safeword to use if an act becomes too much for them to handle emotionally, spiritually or physically.<br /><br />The Dominant is responsible for the health, safety and well being of the submissive. This is not a relationship based on abuse in any way shape or form.  SAFE/SANE/CONSENTUAL is the key.<br /><br />2.) Ana's internal dialogue becomes exhauting. The inner Goddess competes with the subconscious, which competes with her conscious mind is overwheming. Her relatonship with Christian might as well be the blind leading the blind and both will fall into a pit.<br /><br />3.) The repeating of words..mutter, mumble, blush, flush, eye-roll, etc etc, exhausts the reader. I had to go get myself some caffeine just to continue.  If I had a dollar for everytime one of these words was mentioned, I would be richer then Christian Grey. And why do we have to keep hearing the \\"grey/gray\\" word in every other sentence anyway. We get it. He has grey eyes.<br /><br />4.) I have commented on other comments on here.  Sorry, hot granny..you read this 4x's. because you believe this is well written. I almost had to put a pillow over my head for that statement. Do you not have any life whatsoever? Once is more then enough. Imagine if President Obama wrote this on here. God, health care and creating jobs for American's would never get solved.<br/><br />5.)Gentleman Jim, currently on pg 6, enough sarcasm already. Go back and read my comment and learn about BDSM, will you. Thank You.<br /><br />6.) Brian, currently on pg 5,  not sure other's care about the shade of your penis, unless you want to enter the red room of pain first and then post the shade.<br /><br />7.) READ what MADDIEL wrote on page..currently 10. You and I are on the same page...not our posts however (ha-ha)... WRITE WHAT YOU KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /> Also, to add, the author being British sounds like a wanna-be American. Learn our lingo. Who says...Laters, baby. That would be \\"later\\" in the single tense.<br /><br />What saddens me the most is that there are so many literary genius's out there that are not receiving the deserved attention that this book has gotten. Yes, E L James is laughing at all of us as she makes her way to the bank and tells Barbara Walter's that she can't wait to start spending her money on redoing her kitchen.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|UPDATE:<br />have listened 5 times now, and i stick with my initial opinion. 3 of 5 is not bad and the album is not bad. if you're a rush fan, certainly buy it. if not, i wouldn't bother. there are quite a few better rush albums so this is not an ideal introduction to the importance of the band.<br />____________________________________________________<br /><br />so, i'm listening to clockwork angels for the first time, right now. i agree with the reviewers that the production is an over-compressed mess, but overall, i think the album is fine. the songs are solid, but not great. playing is solid, but not great. but... although they remain solid, rush has not been great since hemispheres. clockwork angels is by far not the worst rush album (save that for the '80s drivel), and therefore it does not deserve 1 star. not as good as snakes and arrows, about as good as vapor trails (maybe a bit better, regarding recent stuff), better than that keyboard crap from the '80's, and better than the debut. that's where it fits...<br /><br />if you're a rush fan, get the album. i sincerely doubt they are gaining new fans these days off of new releases, anyway. if you're not a rush fan, so be it...

0393088774|4.0|If you follow Paul Krugman's blog regularly, there's not a lot new in this book.  If you just follow his columns... I'm not sure if it'd be new, since I can't mentally separate out what's just in his columns from what's in his blog.  If you don't follow him at all, then you should go read this book, as it outlines the causes of the crisis, what can be done (easily!) to fix it, and why we should believe him.    I say \\"more solid\\" and \\"outlines\\" because I think there's actually *more* convincing material in his blog.  Scattered around, but as a long time follower I'm convinced Keynesian economics is right, from all the evidence he's presented (including the failures of the other sides.)  But if I'd only read this book, and was skeptical, i'm not sure I'd be convinced, and would probably have questions.    OTOH, a longer book would be less read, so I can see the tradeoffs in his mind.  Let's say that if you read the book and have more questions, there are more answers out there.    His parable of the babysitting co-op, used to explain why printing money in certain circumstances (liquidity traps, aka now) can increase wealth, can be seen [...] which is longer than his posts or columns.  If you're intrigued by that, then the book should be of interest.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Rovio has out done itself again. The classic game of angry birds has been transformed into something new and improved. You can pick from a variety of different seasons such as Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Summer Picnic, Halloween, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas. This game was nothing short of outstanding. My sisters love it and so will your siblings and children. It is kind of challenging yet the fun kind of challenging. If you can't get past the level, you can simply move onto a different season.
0765316994|3.0|After hearing Scalzi speak at a local bookstore, I finally went and tried his books.  They've all been enjoyable, including this one, but I'd say they're all light entertainment.  (Granted, the God Engines isn't light in mood.)  The premise of \\"Star Trek redshirts find out they've been dying off and try to cope\\" sounded very interesting, but the direction he took it in was unexpected, and ultimately unsatisfying to me.  Hard to say more without spoilers.  But, he'd read from something -- a future work?  I wasn't sure -- about the lack of employee safety and OSHA standards and such, and lawsuits taking the \\"Federation\\" to court for not having seatbelts, and that definitely wasn't this book.  Perhaps I'll like that one more.

B0073PPKCI|4.0|Finally, \\"The Visitors\\" gets the Deluxe version afforded to most of ABBA's other albums. What is special about \\"The Visitors\\" is that it was ABBA's most mature work, and it was the first pop recording released in the digital format (CD), way back in 1981.<br /><br />\\"The Visitors\\" saw ABBA at a difficult time, and a breakup was definitely on the cards. Both marriages had dissolved. Chart success was also declining for the group, despite the brilliant work included on this album.  The original release of this album featured 9 tracks only, including the singles \\"One of Us\\", \\"When all is said and done\\" and \\"Head Over Heels\\".<br /><br />This Deluxe CD/DVD (like previous remasters of \\"The Visitors\\" in 1997 and 2001) includes additional tracks, such as singles released the following year in 1982, that were intended for a final album (i.e. \\"Day before you came\\" and \\"Under Attack\\"). That album of course never saw the light of the day as the group had since split up. The strength of ABBA's music is also shown in B-sides which also appear here, like \\"Should I Laugh or Cry\\" and \\"Cassandra\\". Both of these amazing tracks could have been released as A sides in their own right.  The track \\"I Am the City\\" is included on \\"The Visitors\\" for the first time. It first popped up on the compilation \\"ABBA More Gold\\" in 1993. It too was intended for the unreleased final album.<br /><br />The Deluxe CD/DVD is fantastic, make no mistake there. Unfortunately, despite pleads from fans worldwide, the song \\"Just Like That\\" has not been included on this long awaited Deluxe CD. Considered the holy grail of ABBA songs, this particular track has fascinated ABBA fans worldwide for years. Available in demo format (see YT) and partially completed sax version (as provided on the 1994 ABBA Compilation \\"Thank you for the Music\\"), this song has an interesting story behind it. It has a very catchy chorus, but Benny and Bjorn were never quite happy with it. They put it aside and used parts of it in \\"Under Attack\\". Despite rumours of the boys eventually finishing the song, they reportedly declined to release it in its entirety.<br /><br />The DVD features TV performances and commercials from the period. Good to have them, but they have all been available to see on YT for some time.<br /><br />Last but not least, the Deluxe CD sees the glorious album receiving the remastering it deserves. Both the 1997 and 2001 remasters were heavily criticised for shoddy work, including being way too loud. Those issues have been sorted out and the remastering is well done. It should be noted though that the very first pressings of this album on CD way back in 1981 are true collectors items. That is because it is the first pop recording in the digital format (arguably), and features the true full dynamic range, which unfortunately gets tampered with when studios remaster albums years later. Always take care when buying a CD that has been remastered. It doesn't necessarily mean better.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|this was yet another great CD released from Korn. If you are a fan, I do recommend getting this CD.

B00884GR0W|1.0|This game is terrible. Better graphics yeah, but its almost a complete copy of minecraft. Just buy minecraft. It cost $27 dollars but its worth over 9000!!!
0307592731|3.0|I was expecting great, but got fair to good.  This just proves to me again that just because you have a college education and a degree, doesn't mean you have common sense.  I am not a hiker (love fly fishing), other than going on hiking trails for 5 to 8 miles, but really, shoes too small and carrying a back pack that large???  Seriously!!!!  And taking so little cash with her and the boxes she has sent to her along the trail only contain $20.00 most of the time, really?  I guess this was supposed to add the suspense to the story and being able to survive in the wilderness without having money to resupply your food pack.  I was expecting a book containing the adventures you would find on the trail, more wildlife stories, more stories about people she met along the trail, but since she spent most of her time alone, I guess it was hard to have stories like that.  This book is more about her finding herself and her struggles with coming to terms with her childhood, her divorce and her mother's death.  Not what I was expecting at all.  If you want that sort of subject, try [[ASIN:074324754X The Glass Castle: A Memoir]] by Janette Walls.  Excellent book.  Also, I felt at the end of the book she was just trying to finish her book.  Maybe there was a deadline to get finished.  The best part of the book for me was her acquaintance with Doug.  I did enjoy learning things about the trail, such as Crater Lake being the largest crater in North America.  I really enjoyed [[ASIN:B000S1LSAM A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail (Official Guides to the Appalachian Trail)]] Even though Bill Bryson didn't do the entire Appalachian Trail, his book was so funny and full of great stories about the trail.  A laugh out loud, entertaining book.  It is amazing that Cheryl made this hike, even though skipping some of it due to snow fall, and I don't mean to take away from her great accomplishment of completing her hike.  My hat off to her for that, something I probably would never be able to complete, but I would do my research before I started for sure.
B0086700CM|4.0|this games is fun and adicting I be on it all day that's all I do. I totally. think people should play this games more.
B000EENG9Y|3.0|Perhaps they'll settle in after a while, but right now they sound too bright. No warmth or depth. And it took *forever* to tune up the high E string. It just kept relaxing back down. I think I may go back to good ol' red and yellow cards . . .

B00012QM8G|5.0|Oskar Schindler was a German businessman who saved the lives of 1,100 mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. He was a part of the Nazi party and he had many friends very high up in the Nazi ranks. Liam Neeson played the part of Schindler and I think this was one of his best roles. Steven Spielberg directed the movie. It won seven academy awards. I cried so much in the end.  Many Jews and Non-Jews really questioned God and their own faith after this horrific event occurred in history. Over 6 million Jews were murdered during this genocide. A lot of people wondered how God could, if there really was one could allow this to happen. And the only answer that seems to make any sense is God gave man free will to do right or wrong. And I think this movie showed that in the mist of the Holocaust, glimmers of God shown though in the way of people like Oskar Schindler. He could have been killed by the Nazi party doing what he did and he did it anyway all for the benefit of other human beings. He was arrested at one point but he kept on fighting for these people. He never gave up. He lied many times about unskilled workers such as kids or elders to be an asset to the factor. He even allowed his workers to pray in a minyan daily. He spent all of his fortune keeping these people safe. No one knows what Schindler's motives were for saving all these people but he was once quoted saying \\"I knew the people who worked for me... When you know people, you have to behave towards them like human beings.\\" This movie touched my heart on a very deep level.
1400069289|5.0|Read some snippets of this book and bought the book.  It is a facinating read about the structure of habits, how you can implement or alter habits, and what the advertisers know and you may want to know too.  A good read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to make some changes and be more informed.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I read Fifty Shades of Grey and enjoyed it, despite the silly asides, like her uber acrobatic inner goddess and her caustic, frumpy subconscious.  The subject matter was new and interesting.  Fifty Shades Darker was boring.  There, I said it.  It was just an excuse to write a book about Christian and Anna screwing two, three times a day.  And is it just me, or does the author think she's doing a great job of describing the frequent sexual interludes when in fact, I can't even decipher what they're doing most of the time and because the detail is so exhaustingly graphic all the time, I don't care.  I found myself skimming the sex parts, rolling my eyes, willing them to move quicker to get to some semblance of a story.  Fifty Shades Freed was just awful!  It's like you're with these two day in and day out, being subjected to the most irrelevant aspects of their lives, for what?  Because it moves the story along?  Unbelievably bad.  Let me give you Freed in a nutshell.  She promises to stop putting herself in danger, and then disregards her promise each and every time without fail or so much as a second thought.  Of course.  Otherwise, there would be no need to write a third book.  He gets mad at her and threatens her, but never follows through.  Cuz he loves her and love has \\"changed\\" him.  They make up.  They screw.  She allows him to spank her and subject her to all manner of punishment, as long as she gets to orgasm.  If she doesn't, it's torture.  Literally, the one time she thinks to use the safe-word is when he stimulates her but won't let her orgasm.  Yes, it's that stupid.  There, feel free to skip it.  You'll be happier...trust me.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|After seeing Downton Abbey season 1 on Netflix we had to see the second season without waiting. This was worth every penny.
B0023S50DO|2.0|This film has a great premise and exciting opening - a forgotten discovery of a coming impact.  But then it cools down and goes into a belabored series of vignettes about the characters...however it forgets the central point.  The Disaster which only happens 25 minutes from the end!!  And then when we really want to see courage, etc, it ends as suddenly as it starts.<br /><br />These filmmakers need to go back to the Irwin Allen classics like the Towering Inferno.  The disaster begins right from the get go and keeps worsening, trapping characters, creating heroes.  This film lags because there is no disaster to \\"impact\\" the characters.
B0086700CM|1.0|after hearing so many positive reviews about this game I finally downloaded it onto my kindle fire. played it a couple of times and couldn't get rid of it quick enough. repetative and just plain pointless. all these 5 stars reviews must be from 6 year old s because they're the only ones who could appreciate the simplicity of this game. the only point to it is to collect coins and avoid monkeys...over and over again. sorry need something more than just flashy coins to keep my interest.

0765350386|5.0|Do not read this book unless you want to disappear from the world for the next week!<br /><br />Highly addicting. Good plot. Bad news for your social life :)
B006RUJST6|5.0|My sister about me about this book.  I read in one night and once I started it I coud not put it down.  I felt for Lake and Will.  They loved each other and because to thing outside of their control they could not be together.  I loved the stroy it was not beyond beleif it was something that could very will happen and I think that is one of the reason that the story was so good. You could se where they were coming from and you could feel for them.  I will recommend this book to everyone.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Upon first listen, I was a little skeptical.  With the exception of a couple of songs, I just didn't \\"get it\\".  Then I reminded myself that I have this reaction to almost every new Rush record I've bought since becoming a fan in 1984.  However, upon repeated listeings, the songs have grown on me and I believe this album may be one of their best.<br /><br />The first 9 songs are all excellent, and the final 3 are good to very good.<br /><br />I like this album a lot more than all albums since Counterparts.  I just can't get enough of it. I listen to it straight through, then I listen to it again!!  Since buying it 3 weeks ago, I have listened to nothing else.  The songs get better and better.

B008GXHOFW|3.0|the screenshots might look amazing but there is nothing good about this game. the graphics are not that good and you really cant see the buildings unless you get close to them. trust me this game is fun but it might not be worth 7 dollars. and the voice-oversea are terrible they make my ears bleed it does not sound like spiderman at all.
B008220AVW|3.0|This is a fun movie. With a lavish concert in 3D plus the colorful personality of Katy Perry, it'd be hard to accuse this movie of being boring. It will certainly appeal to Katy's fans, and it will also appeal to non-fans for a peek at the life of one of the biggest musical celebrities since Michael Jackson.<br /><br />The lead producer is Brian Grazer, who is one of the most prolific and successful producers of dramatic thrillers (The Da Vinci Code, American Gangster, Robin Hood, 24, Tower Heist, Cowboys & Aliens, etc.). I'm guessing that Katy picked him primarily because of his work on Eminem's \\"8 Mile.\\"<br /><br />I am calling this a \\"movie\\" instead of a \\"documentary\\" because Katy Perry is one of the producers, which means that it cannot honestly claim to be impartial or unbiased. Boxoffice Magazine criticized the movie for that reason, saying, \\"this supposedly honest behind-the-scenes look at Perry's 2011 world tour often feels more like sharp brand management.\\" What's particularly troubling is that the movie alleges to show \\"vulnerable\\" moments, like an unseen camera supposedly capturing a dejected Katy in her dressing room struggling with her deteriorating marriage. Maybe such moments are real, but even so, it seems seedy to include them in the final cut.<br /><br />It sometimes felt like I was watching a 97-minute advertisement. It managed to be enjoyable regardless.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I'm not a connoiseur of the military science fiction genre.  But this was a good read.  It follows a pretty standard \\"military\\" story arc: guy joins the military, bonds with other recruits, goes through basic training, first battle experience, rises through ranks and gets promoted, etc.  But within that conventional story arc, it's actually quite inventive.<br /><br />This story is set in a universe that is teeming with other intelligent alien races, most of which are pretty unfriendly, and many of which see humans as food.  So humanity is constantly fighting someone somewhere.  For about the first half of the book I expected there to be some kind of thought provoking or politically correct twist or revelation about humanity's role in all the violence.  But no, it's much more straightforward than that.  There's not a lot of hand-wringing here about the horrors and inhumanity of war, non-interference with other cultures, aliens' rights to exist, and all that -- it's basically kill or be eaten.  Not exactly what I was expecting, but refreshing in a way, considering that most sci-fi I've read tends toward the opposite extreme.  Some of the descriptions of battles and alien invasions and such are a bit over-the-top with the blood-and-guts-and-gore, which is a minor complaint about the book.<br /><br />Otherwise - the writing is fast-paced, it got my interest early on, and it doesn't drag.  It's pretty easy reading, the writing style is quite economical, but it still reads well.  Dialogue and character development are pretty good, and the book is suffused throughout with a dry wit that I found added some light to the story without being silly.  This is also definitely not \\"hard\\" sci-fi: we are not to concern ourselves with how all the technology works, or whether it is realistic, or anything like that.  That makes it a little more fun.  For all the bloody battle scenes and all, this is really a light space opera with a good sense of humor.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great time passer.  the games are not too hard and not too easy. very easy to earn points and not have to buy them. works great on kindle fire.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|A great movie for the entire family and the 3d is top notch!<br /><br />I felt entirely comfortable watching this movie with my seven year old and that is rare with today's movies. We had a fun time and the awesome 3d effect is better than any other 3d movie that we own.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|OK, I might be biased because I loved the original version ( BREW-STERRRRRRR!!!!! ) but, I really like this remake. To be honest, I still like the original version better but, seriously....this was a great flick. Spooky!<br /><br />Cast: 5 out of 5 (My Favorite was David Tennant - he was great!)<br /><br />Plot: 5 out of 5 - The plot is set in suburbia rather than a castle but, it was still great! My only complaint was that I liked the original more because it was so campy.<br /><br />FX: 5 out of 5 - There were a few moments where I thought they could have done better but, it didn't take away from the film.<br /><br />So, to sum it up. Totally entertaining. Totally spooky and tons of fun.
B003UYV08E|5.0|What can I say?  It's fantastic.  If you're looking for a real \\"thinker,\\" this is obviously NOT the movie for you.  But if you love fun, geeky movies, you'll love it :-)

B0038P59A0|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't hate this movie as I expected.<br /><br />I agree with others who say it is entertaining at least.  It's not a very serious representation of Sherlock Holmes. . .or anything. . . but it is a sort of weird over-the-top action comedy hybrid of the famed investigative consultant.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Sherlock doing KungFu isn't as bad as I expected, in fact I liked it.<br />- somehow this is fun despite your brain telling you that your eyes are watching a stupidly directed movie.<br />- the comedy is sort of funny, not terrible.<br />- the story is sort of nonsense, but doesn't cross the line into completely un-salvageable.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- gratuitous overuse of extreme slo-mo, especially during explosion action sequences.  Gets boring after a while, becomes more of a filmatic crutch than a dramatic device.<br />- the 'blending in' camouflage is too obviously CGI faked/assisted-- it is too perfect.  I'd have preferred if this effect was done entirely practical, which would have been more fun since it wouldn't be such a perfect disguise-- fitting in with the other comedic disguise attempts in the film.<br />- Sherlock seems more capable of fighting than Watson, which I think is out of balance from the original material, and weakens the sense that Sherlock needs an assistant in the first place.<br /><br />summary:<br />If Iron Man and Jack Sparrow had a baby and sent it back in time to the 1800's, it would grow up to be this version of Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />point of movie: sort of save the world from itself.<br />kudos: having the guts to jump right into the story, instead of the usual ponderous origin story to explain the character's past history to audience.<br /><br />buy/rent/skip: rent
B001RNO7AI|4.0|I wore a pair of my running shoes on a recent trip to Europe.  We walked all day and my feet became fatigued and tired due to the lack of support. I tried on the Riva in a outdoor themed store and immediately I could feel the quality and support I was looking for.  A bit pricy but at 63 my feet aren't growing anymore.  I can see myself wearing them for many years.  One additional benefit is that they are waterproof.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is the best Rush album since the early 80's...most diehard Rush fans know that there's really not a bum album in the whole lot besides a couple of their early live albums (which sound like they were, to quote Sublime, \\"Too drunk to light the bong, too stoned to write the song\\"), and that horrific, thankfully short-lived blunder into rap known as Roll the Bones, but hey, nobody's perfect! This album is definitely one which gets better and better which each hearing, these guys never cease to amaze me with their individual and collective talents!  Power Trios Rule!!

B007N85ZXY|5.0|Light the campfire, break out the guitars and beer and get ready to sing along with Neil Young & Crazy Horse as they gallop through a signature tour of the 19th & 20th centuries via the classic North American folk songbook. Neil and the Horse bring their eclectic playfulness, rollicking drive and high flying spirit to rocking renditions of 19th century classics like \\"Oh Susanna,\\" \\"Clementine\\" and \\"Jesus Chariot\\" (commonly know as \\"Coming 'Round the Mountain\\"), and lend their restless electric melancholy to \\"High Flying Bird,\\" and \\"Wayfaring Stranger.\\"<br /><br />The album takes turns being playful, Do Wapping on \\"Get a Job\\" and serving up a rollicking chorus on \\"Tom Dula,\\" to taking a Pop swing at \\"This Land is your Land\\" and \\"Gallows Pole,\\" all while preserving the original intent of the lyrics with passion, musical wit and a trickster's eye. There's even a treat for our monarchists and patriots out there, who'll love the garage band/ school anthem mash up of \\"God Save the Queen\\" and \\"Let Freedom Ring.\\"<br /><br />All in all it's a clever, heartfelt, folksy hayride of an album... Don't forget the s'mores..

B001A4LYN2|1.0|Other than this film being concerned with an oil man in the early 20th century, and some overlap of character names I fail to see any cause for the claim that this is based on Upton Sinclair's 'Oil!'  Sinclair's novel is a sweeping epic and multi-faceted, historically relevant story of the complex interplay between capitalist greed and corruption and the labor movement, national and world politics, war, socialism, communism, evangelical Christianity, atheism, a father's love for his son, a child's wonder, coming of age, first love, Hollywood's decadence, personal growth, and on and on. J Arnold Ross, Sinclair's oil man, is driven but compassionate, relatively benevolent and quite open-minded among his kind, He bears no resemblance whatsoever to the twitching sociopath depicted by Lewis in this Film. And the novel is written from the perspective of the son, who does not lose his hearing, who is a young adult in most of the book, and who never abandons his father.  There is an Eli, and though he would be deserving of a good beating he never gets one, and there is a Paul, who is not Eli (in the film it appears that Paul is perhaps Eli's second personality);in fact Paul is a major character and drives much of the capitalism vs socialism vs communism theme - which is an enormous and perhaps the central issue of the novel, completely ignored in this film.  On its own, I might grant 'There Will Be Blood' some merits - Lewis's intense performance, the eerie music and above average cinematography, but for claiming to be in any way based on Sinclair's wonderful novel I condemn it to the lowest cellar of Hollywood hackery. This is half of a cheap horror flick or psychological thriller at best. I guess we'll have to wait for 'Oil!' to actually come to the screen.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great game. It is very addictive, I can't put it down. My 10 year old son loves it too.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this free as the FAOTD back on May 23 &amp; have completed at least one puzzle a day, every day since. Usually more than one...because it's so addicting, but I still have plenty more puzzles left! The point of the game is to narrow down which blocks aren't colored (putting an &quot;x&quot;), so that you can figure out which ones are colored. There are 10 puzzles on the first level, which is more tutorial than challenge. Then there are 47 puzzles on each additional level (5-6?). Plus, the developer didn't add crappy permissions, eye-sore graphics, aggravating music, in-app purchases, open feint, or any of that other crap. There were a few people that mentioned wanting to see the clock/battery life and the last update added both-I, too, had wished I could see both. The more advanced puzzles take awhile. Even though the regular price is $4.95-the enjoyment I have gotten out of this game would well be worth it. Therefore, I'm going to purchase the recently added CrossMe Color (also $4.95) to support this developer-we need more quality developers out there. :)

B000VWJ6D4|5.0|When you hear a song that reminds you of a happy time in your youth; you just have to have it again. Happy memories should never be lost. It is wonderful to have this CD again. I think this was one of Elton John's greatest albums.

1439148953|4.0|I'd never read anything by Colm Toibin, though I've heard his name for years. I picked this book up for some light summer reading.<br /><br />Eilis (had to look up the pronunciation!) is a young Irish woman whose move to America is determined by her mother and sister. Through a connection with a priest in Brooklyn, Eilis ends up a shopgirl in a department store. She lives in a boarding house for Irish girls, and begins to take accounting courses at night. She finds herself a boyfriend, and eventually faces a life-determining dilemma.<br /><br />And that's about it. For readers who want big moments -- big, American moments -- this isn't the book. But that's what I appreciated most about Mr. Toibin's work. His characters are recognizable. They have their quirks and their faults, they have their lovable moments and their thoughtful moments. Their days are made of small decisions about what will make them the most happy, or at least the most comfortable.<br /><br />I would have given the book five stars -- the writing alone merits it -- but truthfully, I found the ending a little disappointing. Eilis makes a choice. You would think making one decision over another would be a clear winner, but I don't think that's so, in this case. I couldn't see Eilis being happy whichever path she took. Both choices seemed too constricting and depressing to me. Maybe you'll think differently, though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought Wool Omnibus edition based on reviews which is something that I do not do very often.  The sheer number of positive reviews (and ratio of positive to negative) convinced me to buy the series rather than try the first book for free.  I LOVED these books.  I cannot put it any other way. Honestly I think that if I wrote this review without holding back than nobody would believe it was from a satisfied customer and just think it was the author trying to bid up his work.  These books are that good.  To all potential readers: buy these, you will not be disappointed. To the author Hugh Howey: Thank  you, this is a fantastic story and very well written.  Please continue with this series, First shift is fantastic too, great work all around.  I will keep an eye out for your next release.
0805095535|5.0|At 64, Paul Auster has written a memoir Winter Journal. In it, it's clear he has death on his mind, not death like \\"woe is me,\\" but death contemplated as an opportunity, an urgent one, to discover, those states of mind old age takes us, states in which, as Auster ends his book, \\"A door has closed. Another has opened.\\" In other words, Auster hungers for transcendence.<br /><br />He writes about this type of transcendence earlier in the memoir during which time he has a conversation with the famous French actor Trintignant (they meet at one of Auster's book readings in Paris) who says in a private moment: \\"Paul, there's just one thing I want to tell you. At fifty-seven, I felt old. Now, at seventy-four, I feel much younger than I did then.\\" Initially, Auster is confused by the actor's words, but Auster explains that as he grows older the words are slowly making more and more sense. Something happens to the soul. It defies chronological time and mortality itself in a way. There is also a conquering of fear. But Auster makes it clear he hasn't totally grasped the message, just intuitive bits and pieces as he grows older.<br /><br />In his search for wisdom and transcendence, Auster will interpret life through his tactile human body, all versions of it, young, middle-aged, and now old, and his perception of pain, pleasure, panic filtered through the body at various stages becomes the conduit from which he tries to make sense of the kernel of wisdom lying beneath Trintignant's enigmatic statement.<br /><br />Another piece of wisdom Auster learns as he chronicles the aging of his body is that the body knows more than the mind. He will for example suffer gastritis as a reaction to the havoc of starting a new life after breaking up with a girlfriend. While his mind may be in denial about the fear of starting life over, his body knows full well the terror and Auster's body, time and time again in this memoir, gives him panic attacks, stomachaches, and other pains to let him know he needs to find out what he's really thinking, what he's really experiencing.<br /><br />Written in the second person and full of autobiographical anecdotage, the book has a sense of urgency about it; it has the quality of a man who is standing face to face with his mortality and needs to find a way to make sense of his life so that death does not make a mockery of it.<br />This is a great Paul Auster book for fans and non-fans alike. Highly recommended.now he needs to find out what he's really thinking, what he's really experiencing.<br /><br />Written in the second person and full of autobiographical anecdotage, the book has a sense of urgency about it; it has the quality of a man who is standing face to face with his mortality and needs to find a way to make sense of his life so that death does not make a mockery of it.<br />This is a great Paul Auster book for fans and non-fans alike.

B002NEFL8W|4.0|In terms of design, function, and aesthetics, the BG-E7 grip is a must have for any serious DSLR photog.  The most obvious benefit is the extra battery life you get when you add an extra battery pack to the two battery bay.  This is my second Canon battery grip and I've never run out of battery power while shooting...and I often go weeks between battery charges.  I also really like the ergonomic feel of the grip...it gives me much more flexibily when handling my 7D.  In addition to the extra shutter button located on the grip which makes horizontal shots much easier, there are several other useful function buttons that increase the versatility of this unit.  On the down side I'm not crazy about the extra weight the BG-E7 contributes to the 7D...this is particularly obvious when out doing day-long location shots...though I think in the long run, this is a minor inconvenience when compared to the benefits this grip provides.  The other complaint I have is the fact that Canon forced me to buy new batteries for the BG-E7...I have another battery grip that I used on my old 20D and 40D, but to my surprise and dissapointment the old grip doesn't work with the 7D.  I wondered why I had to buy a new grip for my 7D and discovered when I tried to insert one of my old Canon batteries into the BG-E7 that they don't fit...not cool...particularly considering I have 4 batteries for the old grip system...and the new batteries ain't cheap.  Overall I do recommend this product, but wish that Canon had allowed me to use the old grip system...I'm not sure why they did this unless the 7D requires more power that couldn't be satisfied with the old battery system.  Having a grip makes shooting easier and significantly increases control when handling my 7D.  A great product.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I downloaded Mile 81 a short story from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire. I thought the Author Stephen King did a good job writing this short story. The story takes place in Maine and the Author did a good job of creating the scenes and characters. The short story has the feel of From a Buick 8 and Christine. I have read most of the e-books Stephen King has written. I think this story was way too short. The price of $3.99 was too much for this short story. The price should have been $1.00 to $1.99. There were large spaces in between a lot of the words and did distract me while I was reading this short story. I think they may have cheeped out on the formatting and did it automatically instead of by hand, which cost a little extra.  This is the first e-book I have read by Stephen King with the formatting problem. I have and would recommend this e-book to a friend.

0307472590|5.0|La Sombra del Viento is one of the best thrillers/mystery books I've read in the last 10 years.<br />What stands out about this book?<br />- The mystery is very well developed and unwind along the book. Ruiz Zafón provides some clues that allow the reader to develop his/her own theories and hypothesis. Still, they are not enough. They way in which facts and information come to the story make the reader's head spin and wonder, what the heck happened here?<br />- Different than typical thrillers, the author did a very good work in developing the characters (specially the main character).<br />- The setting is very well crafted too. It has a dark and sort of anxious ambiance...<br /><br />The only weakness I see in this book is that information, in many instances, comes in long and unrealistic bursts. I wonder if there could have been another way.<br /><br />Still, it's a great book. You will need a lot of discipline to put it down, to fall asleep, while you're reading it. I highly recommend it to be read when you don't have a lot of commitments (like work), because you won't want to stop reading once  you begin.
0345803493|1.0|awful writing.  I feel like it was written by an oversexual 12 year old. Nothing new here just to much of it.  No story just sex.  Know exactly how this will turn out.  No need to buy all 3.

0385344228|5.0|Turow was an innovator,  an attorney writing  a murder mystery, who can add the real perspective from the legal side.  Presumed Innocent was his best book.  I don't believe the others following it outdid this initial provocative novel.  William Manday's third book, Defending Jacob, has all of the legalese a reader would need but this author creeped into my worst fears and took my breath away with his story.  Cleverly setup with the opening scene of a grand jury hearing, Andy Barber, a former (first) assistant attorney, is being questioned by a former protege, Neal Logiudice, who has high political and legal goals. Shouldn't Andy be handling the case? He tried, but was taken off the case because in heart wrenching detail, Andy's only child, Jacob, is accused of the murder of his classmate, Ben Rifkin.  The grief of Ben's father is almost palpable while Andy tries to give him pat and sympathetic responses.<br /><br />The novel is timely. The use of social media guarantees us all that nothing is erased; there are no secrets.  Jacob and his friends indulge in special websites and Facebook and the effects of their comments and ideas could implicate many of us, innocent or not.<br /><br />The novel moves the reader in and out of the legal framework but what Mr. Manday does better is get into the mind of Andy as he become omnipotent.  He and his lovely wife, Laurie, become damaged in the process.  How could any parent stand up to the possibility of their child as a murderer or one falsely accused of murder?  His life will never be the same, no matter the outcome of a trial.  Neither will the parents; every day brings its gnawing questions and the agony of waiting.  Anyone who has had the misfortune of living through a disaster, which will forever change one's life, can identify with the parents and possibly, the professionals.  It is a dire waiting game, from day to day, what does the jury think?  How will the judge rule on that motion?  How do we get from breakfast to dinner? Terminally ill patients or ones diagnosed with a debilitating disease, wait for results of tests and then again wait for more tests or treatments.  It invades the smallest details of one's life.  And so the Barbers live from hour to hour; they are pariahs.  Their friends have deserted them, they are using up their money and there is the question of their son's innocence.  Manday introduces us to secrets in Andy's life and their possible impact on the case.  There is a bounty of brilliant ideas and writing in this novel.  There is always something underneath the surface that the author holds back until he wants it placed in his plot.  This book deserves 5+ stars.  There was only one weakness I noted.  Laurie's father is a psychiatrist; she came from an educated, thoughtful family.  Laurie did not want her parents at the trial; that didn't ring true.  There would have been no way they would not have been there for their daughter or grandson.  Other than that, read it and you will see how the author pieces it all together for you.  Raw emotion is evident on almost every page; you better keep reading.ner?

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I quit this book when I was about 5% into it because I thought there was too much sex, then I decided because I already bought it I shouldn't waste my money.  It turned out to be a great read, I'd never read a book like it.  Once I got past the sex I loved it, it's a great love story-and really does have a plot.

030758836X|3.0|I really enjoyed the first three quarters of this book. The writing is engaging, the plot slick, the character voices very real and specific. I figured out the big reveal pretty early, but didn't hold it against the novel. The ending felt rushed and lackluster, and really didn't ring true. And a huge plot hole gnawed at me, doing more to ruin the book than anything else. A fun, but ultimately unsatisfying, read.

B001DF68MA|5.0|I purchased the (non-LTD) WeeRide for my daughter last year just after she turned one and she loved it instantly.  The seat is STILL in use this year, and while she is taller, she stills fits with her kness slightly more bent than normal.  I love that she sits infront of me and I can still interact with her and not have to turn around.  I have two issues that are totally managable for me, but may not for others, so I must mention them.  1st: she can reach my handle bars, when we're not moving it's no problem but sometimes she trie when we are moving, and it hinders my reach for the brakes and she tries to move the handles herself.  All I have to do is remind her to hold \\"her handle\\" but if your child doesn't listen, that may be a serious problem.  2nd; for the bar to mount, I had to raise my seat. I'm 5'3\\" so that inch I had to raise my seat was a little challenge.  When I start and stop, I either tilt the bike to one side (which made my little one nervous at first, but now shes used to it) or I make sure i have something to kind of support my self against (ie. light pole, tree, my own car...)  For myself these were easy to overcome, but others may not have such an easy time.  But I REALLY love this seat, my daughter still laughs every single time we start a ride because she loves biking so much. I am so in love with this purchase! Plus, when I ride my bike to work, it's simple to remove the seat from the mounting bar and leave the seat at home.  They achieve this ease w/o comprimising safety either. WEE LOVE THIS SEAT!!
B0087240Z4|3.0|Disclaimer: I am a huge fan of the SP. I liked all their albums except for Zeitgeist which was an overly drummy, frenetic, repetitive album with no range.<br /><br />This album sounds a lot like the old SP except for a few things...<br /><br />The vocals are not great. Billy Corgan just comes across as flat, and mostly, sounds strained. On previous albums, the skill in which he exploited his odd voice and vocal range was one of the key things that made their music interesting. He can sing very sweetly in falsetto when he almost whispers. He can also scream like his distorted guitars. Mid range is not really where his talent lies but that's pretty much where he stays on this album. The blandness is compounded by lack of post production on the vocals and even very little harmonizing with other vocalists.<br /><br />The majority of lyrics are sickly saccharine. Billy Corgan used to be a poet, now he sounds like a lovesick, new-age hippy overdosed on prozac. I get it -- the gothic image from the ol' Adore album is old hat, but yikes. Make a drinking game about how many times he sings the word \\"light\\", \\"love\\", or \\"sun\\" in this album and you'll need a stomach pump at the end of the night.<br /><br />The happy electronica on some of the songs, e.g. Pinwheels, do not jive well with the guitar driven, melodic sound that SP is famous for IMO. It overwhelms everything and is very repetitive. Pinwheel sounds like a really bad rendition of one of Owl City's songs (before it utterly changes into something different, but that brings me to my last point.)<br /><br />Finally, the most egregious thing: song composition. While not as repetitive as Zeitgeist, it's not as progressive their old stuff. The progression that is there is sloppy and sometimes downright jarring. Pinwheels for example, the first half sounds nothing like the last half. I am okay with that but there is no real transition happening between the two parts. I think this is the most surprising flaw because Billy Corgan used to be a master at it. Songs like Soma and Geek USA are some examples.<br /><br />But as far as albums go, overall it's not bad and a good sign that even if SP isn't back Billy Corgan still has great talent. Maybe he's a little rusty but there is a hell of a difference between this and Zeitgeist. If his next album improves as much it'll be well worth the wait.
1400031001|5.0|OK, I admit it, I read this book because I enjoyed so much the Masterpiece presentation of the story.  How they were able to abridge it into as short a form as they did is beyond me.  But reading the book was even more enjoyable than seeing the Masterpiece  production.  It is certainly not a book to rush through.  Like a fine wine, it is to be sipped and savored.  As others have said, I was sorry to come to the end of it.  The descriptions of life in a small public college, the pictures of London in earlier decades, the war stories, the connection with the art world...all of this was unique and lovely.  Some may recall that the Masterpiece presentation of the novel started with Logan's father telling him that life was so much a matter of luck.  I read the book watching for this, but it only came in the very last pages, and it was not his father who made the observation.  It was Logan himself.  The Masterpiece folk took a bit of liberty with this detail.  But this is a great book to be read and enjoyed, slowly, slowly, slowly.
030758836X|5.0|This book is getting a lot a buzz and I'm happy to say it lives up to the hype. This page turner so twisted and disturbing but so amazing. Can't wait to read her other novels.
B004EPZ034|1.0|Since when do the chipmunks hang out in casinos? Also, at one point, the chipmunk Simon gets bitten by a spider and becomes a French chipmunk named Simone. At least half of this movie is spent focusing on Simon(and Simone) and Jeanette, and Alvin is barely in the picture. This might be a good movie for kids, but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone over the age of 10.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of those secret fun reads.  Aside from some \\"too much\\" paragraphs, this is a great read before a tired mom's date night.
B0087DFIYA|4.0|A fresh take on someone with unique skills. Kind of like, Taken, or maybe more like Snatch. I enjoyed the different environment, which was set in a bazaar-like Mexican prison. The story telling was really fitting for the movie, helping the continuous flow the movie was aiming for. And, luckily for us, there was not much wasted moment, be it the action scenes or the slower-paced learning curves with the kid taking the lead in many scenes. This was a greatly entertaining movie, and had they avoided the emotional disconnect between Gibson and the female lead(?), it would have been a five-star worthy movie for me...Regardless, this was the old Gibson before his breakdown, so don't hesitate to give him another chance even if it is only limited to the duration of this movie.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Being a huge syfy fan as well as a CHristian...this movie is awesome. I've seen it several times, and will watch it for years to come. I don't own many movies, maybe 15. I only buy excellent movies and this is one.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|I haven't seen the original TV series but I have seen The Sitter with Jonah Hill which I hated, so I wasn't expecting too much from this formulaic cop-buddy drama set in high school. To be honest though, it's not bad, delivering some fairly solid laughs amid some really ludicrous setups and pretty much everything you see in Act One is a setup for a punch line in the finale.<br /><br />As usual, all the high schools kids look way too old to be in high school which gets around the potential creepiness of these guys going on prom dates with teenagers. And if vulgarity turns you off, this may not be the movie for you since it's on par with The Hangover for the inevitable stream of juvenile sex jokes.<br /><br />The film is about 15-20 minutes too long so by the end it gets a little long in the tooth. The supposed case they are solving is barely worth much attention and plays out as you would expect. But really Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill provide enough chemistry to keep the ship afloat and there are a few moments that make you realize it's not nearly as bad as it could have been.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was an intense, gripping story, which keeps you going from beginning to end.  This was the first of her novels I've read, but I will definitely read her others.
B007Z9QWVK|3.0|Andrea Riseborough rescues this film, providing a portrayal of Wallis Simpson that elevates her storyline from two-dimensional melodrama to fine art. The historical part is well shot and for the most part quite engaging although doesn't really offer anything particularly new. The theme of the film is that the rich and famous aren't worth associating with and it's better to get connected with true salt-of-the-earth types which may be true but seems somewhat forced given the historical context.<br /><br />The modern day B-story is a disaster. Abbie Cornish gets routinely beaten up by her husband, mirroring Wallis' opening scene, and there's little explanation about how these two women are connected other than their dismally abusive spouses. Supposedly an auction of Wallis and Edward's personal items provides the flashback opportunity for Cornish's character who's for no reason obsessed with their history. It's a weak plot device and might have worked if the modern story had any substance whatsoever. And the predictably feminist angle that Madonna injects feels out of place in the historical storyline and creates risably thin detestable men in the modern plot.<br /><br />This isn't a bad film and has elements of being a great movie. The score is atmospheric if slightly overbearing at times. It's dressed up beautifully and looks every part as good as The King's Speech. Even the dialog is mostly very good and then occasionally stumbles with anachronistic terms that remind you that it's good but uneven. So ignore the fact that this bombed at the box office and try to forget that Madonna directed and for the most part it's still better than many of the films released this year.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a pretty cool application....it is fun to pass the time away.  The little pictures are cute and its not impossibly hard.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Breaking Bad the Fourth Season arrived just in time before season five starts on July 15th. I started watching this series a little later but am all caught up now, probably the greatest television series I have ever seen and it just gets better every season. It will be sad when season five ends but will be very interesting to see how they wrap everything up. Thumbs way up to Vince Gilligan all the actors and crew for creating this fantastic series!!!*****
0060936223|5.0|This is the best book I have read in some time.  It was highly recommended to me.  And it was every bit as good as people said it would be.  A lovely and moving story of friendship and camaraderie in a special place at a special time.  It is plain spoken and unpretentious - I have friends who revered Patti Smith from back in the day.  I went on line and downloaded a bunch of her records because I want to understand this time better than I do now.  A very lovely piece.
1595828753|5.0|This book really brought me back to the days of the cartoon. It was beautifully illustrated and all of the characters were familiar. I would recommend this to any avatar fan! :)
B0050PYNP8|1.0|One word can sum up this film...disappointment.<br /><br />With \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" Simon Pegg and Nick Frost broke the mold for zombie-comedy films. The gore was ancillary to the development of the characters and to the two main characters' friendship. You really wanted those two to survive.<br /><br />\\"Hot Fuzz\\" broke the mold again. This time for police comedies. The humor was most often very subtle and natural.<br /><br />What the heck happened with their new collaboration \\"Paul\\"? We went from character development and ingenious humor in the previous films to bathroom humor and bigotry. In addition, the film was so long that any interest in the final scene was roughly grounded away.<br /><br />I do hope that Mr. Pegg and Mr. Frost will join together in the future for another production...this time minus the toilet humor, toilet banter, toilet gags...and bigotry.<br /><br />Skip this flick and watch \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz.\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|so what its endless but its got a good idea for the game the point is to beat your highscore and keep beating it every time
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cool game I like it a lot mom says it looks like a good game for me too I like the families
B007FH9GA6|3.0|This is an interesting story, but the 2009 version was just fine in it's original version from Sweden. I see many people on here talking about how this is different from the first film. I have seen both of these back to back and I can't see the need to remake it.  It is virtually scene for scene the same as the original, and the quality of the film used, sound, and lighting even feel the same, if not worse.  The only thing they did was bring in bigger actors, namely Daniel Craig, Stellan Skarsgard, Christopher Plummer to name a few, then made them speak English with an accent to make it sound Swedish to apparently make it more appealing for the US audience.  Also had a bigger budget, but all they spent it on was actors and trent rezonor to do the soundtrack, just superfluous spending that added nothing for me.  Really no need to do so.  I watched the original with subtitles, and the English overdub was not bad when I tried it.  Again, interesting enough movie, worth a viewing if you are a fan of the series, but don't get your hopes up for something different or better.
B003VANOFY|5.0|After doing a bit of research - I concluded that this was the clear winner in \\"best wireless headset\\".<br /><br />First impression - What a letdown.  These headphones sound like a cheap plastic pair that I could get at any swap meet!<br /><br />THEN - I did a little playing around with the equalizer (that despite what other reviewers seem to say DOES exist) and these headphones went from \\"what a disappointment\\" to \\"HOLY COW - WOW!!\\"<br /><br />You ABSOLUTELY need to fiddle around with the equalizer to get these cans where you want them.  But once you do - I don't see how they can be beat.  AWESOME sound - and the battery truly does last around 10 hours.  Even when low on battery, you simply plug in to the (provided) micro-USB and you're good to go.  It's still getting audio via wireless, but appears to be a wired headset since it's getting power from a wire (until charged and then you can go wireless again!).<br /><br />My house is roughly 2,000 square feet.  I can go ANYWHERE in the house without losing the signal.<br /><br />All in all - GREAT headset.  Highly recommended.  Just be aware that they are likely NOT going to be pleasing \\"out of the box\\" - you must adjust the equalizer.<br /><br />- Ron Donofero

B005LAIGZU|5.0|one of the best movies ive seen in a long time.  Lots of people complain about the \\"bad\\" acting but the movie isnt for the acting its about the stories of our heros in uniform putting thier lives on the line for our freedom and protection.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|My biggest disappointment was that I did not read any of the reviews instead of taking the average rating as a guide.<br />My second disappointment is that I purchsed the trilogy instead of one book<br />I have to say that it is the biggest load of unbelievable crap I have read<br />I don't know what it says about the people who gave it 5 stars. Giving it one is one too many
B005LAIH54|3.0|Sequels tend to either surpass or bury their original photoplay but rarely do both.  Director Johnathan Liebesman's 'WRATH OF THE TITANS' does just that.  Utilizing mostly the same cast from last years 'CLASH OF THE TITANS', the filmmakers did what the original fought against, overpowering the audience with CGI eye candy and taking away from the performances thereby having the characters as nothing more than game board pieces moved around according to the technicians whims boosting the lame screenplay. Mythical creatures not included in the original such as Minotaurs , Cyclops and two headed fire breathing canines complete the catalogue of Mythological Who's Who between both films. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes stand around and posture while our hero played by Sam Worthington is more wooden than the original which is not his fault, its what the script requires by sledge hammering the next CGI action montage down the audiences throats.  Poor Rosamund Pike and Danny Huston who are always excellent suffer the same fate as they are also engulfed in the proceedings.  Overall, not a bad time waster but it looks like the producers may make another sequel involving Perseus's offspring.  The DVD transfer is nice but grainy in its 1.85 aspect ratio probably due to the 3D theatrical format and the 5.1 surround sound gets a trite muddy during dialogue scenes crammed with music and loud roars being forced through the sub woofer.  This 'WRATH' may become tiresome but it has one thing going for it, its never boring.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great ap.  lots of good games.  very addictive. I have spent too much time playing this game.
1400067936|2.0|Far too weighted with financial world references. Lacks the broader insights, revelations and brilliant style of his Black Swan masterpiece.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the story and the main characters.  It's a fun/quick read and it keeps you interested. Some of the characters were a little unbelievable but on the flipside they were all kind of caricatures of people in real life.  The other part of the book that I really enjoyed was the underlying commentary on relationships - it wasn't forefront as an in-your-face kind of theme but it was definitely there.  Would definitely recommend it for a fun summer read.
B0050I2P32|5.0|Thanks to NPR's All Songs Considered, I caught a live version of The Horrors' \\"Changing the Rain\\" on the show's recap of the 2011 All Tomorrow's Parties festival ([...]), and I really liked what I heard. Got the album and, ... Wow! I've since listened to earlier Horrors albums, and while they are of some interest, Skying is the best. Very very good. Get it! You'll like it!
0606259090|5.0|I just finished Fifty Shades Freed yesterday.  I loved this series.  It is has been a long time since I have been drawn into a book like this.  I cried in all three. They were great.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy this game because it's a great way to waste time, it's fun and enjoyable; however,  unlocking new games requires far too much effort in my opinion. I want to spend time enjoying a variety of mini games,  not looking at all the games i don't have yet and wondering if they're better than the ones I already have.
0345803485|1.0|Nicolas sparks writes better books, amd i rhink he is one of the worst writers in history!  Haha some of you will like this book but I can  assure you that if you are intelligent and can read above a 6th grade level you'll think that this book is pathetic and that the writing is terrible.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|As a rule, I'm not a fan of prequels written 10 or 15 books into a series, since they often indicate that the author is out of new ideas . This one, however, was worth reading--enjoyable, fast paced, with an interesting mystery to be solved by Reacher. I purchased it with trepidation but ended up finding it to be one of my favorite Reacher novels.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think you should get it cause you can play variety of the games. I. think some like all and some don't
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Is this a great movie?  Probably not.  Is it unique, diverting, and able to pack a wallop?  Absolutely.  Just seeing Christoph Waltz get his due at the end is worth watching the whole thing.  Waltz ventures constantly toward 'over the top' that constantly had me wondering was he really THAT bad an actor, following bad direction, or what?  He's downright irritating every moment on film and his scene in the Paris cafe where  he is talking and eating  at the same time is classic irritation.  One, frankly, wants to knock his block off!  He WAS playing a Nazi -- the ultimate Nazi ---so some disgust is expected.  HOWEVER, I chanced to see him in an entirely different movie, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, and damned if he wasn't just as irritating in that! His performances are transparent and shallow.  There is nothing likable about him at all. This man should never eat and talk at the same time!
0345803485|5.0|good reading and description of one of many types of relationships consenting adults may engage into, makes you think why some people feel the need for these relationships, and if curious enough you will do your own research on this topic and maybe get some honest insight into your deepest self.

6305922756|5.0|Unlike ingenuous(simple) slapstick or sex-based comedy ...\\"This is Spinal Tap\\" is truly ingenious(brilliant). If you want to watch this out of the corner of your eye while you're cleaning...you are not going to enjoy this movie, IF you do actually concentrate on the film you will see some absolutely hilarious, often tongue-in-cheek humor (i.e the band members when talking about a controversial album cover all sport herpetic lesions around their mouth and lips; wrapping cucumbers in aluminum and putting them in their tight trousers - emulating a massive personal member; lyrics in a song entitled \\"Big Bottom\\" ....i.e. \\"How can I leave this behind?\\"; ...among many other hilarious bits.<br /><br />The artists most successfully lampoon \\"England's Loudest Band\\".<br /><br />If you're completely unaware of rock and roll and it's performers and their nuances and fancies ....this movie may/will seem dumb.<br /><br />On the other hand....<br /><br />IF, you ARE aware of Rock and Roll and its' musicians....this movie will hit the mark!<br /><br />5 stars ONLY because I can't give more!
B00785P2QC|4.0|its awesome except have to wait a while to earn enough money to get good enterminent  places and expansions could be little better
B004XXIHS2|1.0|I read this book because my sister, who isn't as picky a reader as I am, said it was great. Well, we discovered yet another key difference in our reading likes/dislikes. She loved this book all in--story, characters, plots. I was bored out of my mind, hated the main character and finally just gave up on the story. I think if you are a Levine fan, it's probably a great book. For me: Yawn.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I may be biased, being a Marine and all, but this is without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read.  I read it in a day, and I hate reading....my girlfriend thought I was mad at her because I didn't want to put it down and talk with her when she came home from work.
B004T4KQJS|2.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the science part of this book, but thought the theological debate is superfluous.  I am not quite sure of the author's purpose - to educate or to argue with religion?  Often religious arguments are unproductive, and this book makes no exception.  It's unlikely it will change any minds.  As to the science part, the book focuses on the origin and evolution of the Universe.  The same topics are covered by Brian Greene's Fabric of the Cosmos, which I found more in-depth and easier to understand.

B003BWERF8|5.0|I purchased this to use with an iPod Nano 6G and the Jaybird Freedom Bluetooth ear buds. Kokkia found the ear buds on the first try and connected. The instructions were reasonably clear and everything worked as advertised...true plug and play.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE: OK<br />I've been using it while running and walking for about two weeks. The iPod nano battery is good for about an hour before it needs a charge. To keep it from draining the battery when I'm not using the Jaybirds I disconnect the Kokkia.<br /><br />The Kokkia seems to like the ipod being on before you plug it in. Occasionally I'll forget, plug it in and then turn on the ipod; resulting in the ipod reporting \\"device not supported.\\" An unplug and replug solves the problem.<br /><br />RECEPTION: Excellent<br />I keep the iPod and Kokkia either in a shirt pocket on my left shoulder or clipped to a belt loop on my right side. The Jaybird's receiver is in the right ear piece. I've had no issues with Bluetooth reception even though the common recommendation is to only use the device on your upper right arm.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Hmmm<br />My desire was to be able to run without being tethered to ear bud cords. While I can do that now, the limitations with this setup make me question my plan! Removing the Kokkia every time after use to keep the battery from draining will be wearing on the ipod connector...not a good thing. The Kokkia is so small that it is easy to drop or forget. The Jaybird earbuds have good sound quality but they are bigger than normal earbuds and also require charging. So while I'm untethered I have two more things to avoid losing and have to charge more frequently. I'm not sure it is worth the expense!
B005LAII08|1.0|Saw it two other families, total of 9 kids ages 2-10. We made an unfortunate mistake to choose the 3D screening.<br />The movie is violence-packed. Very scary to kids and parents alike. Parents beating themselves on the head<br />what they brought the kids to, kids struggle with each violent scary scene and trying to show the next<br />one that they can make it through. We had to delegate one parent who finally left the theather with three of<br />our youngest ones 2, 4.5 and 5 as they were watching in horror and had no intention to hide it.<br />At the end of the movie there were plenty of seats left - mind that the movie started with full theather.<br />I don't recall any quite as violent kids movie that would be rated PG in long while. The movie is much<br />underrated in my opinion for the violence, language and profanity.<br />As someone already staed, you can't provide any parental guidance in a theater. The movie happens<br />so fast and the kids get scared beyond belief.<br /><br />I believed that the 3D version did more damage then non 3D, yet when cmpared notes with friends<br />who saw it in non-3D their hair was just as raised.<br /><br />My personal recommendation - if you have children younger then 11 or so, do wait for the disc,<br />evaluate it BEFORE showing it to the little ones. The traile is not doing the justice.<br />The trailer makes you believe you are going to see a gentle fun movie with some elements of<br />adult humor. The reality is very different. The movie is violent and scary and dark for the most part.<br />Very, very loud.<br /><br />I would especially like to make aware parents of kids with Censory integration issues,<br />Autism and all children who can't adequately express their fears and emotions as<br />this might be a damaging experience.<br /><br />This movie makes the beast from The Beauty and the Beast looking like a Telletuby huggable furry creature,<br />and cmoparing Brave to Tangled - it is like a Omen to Barney.<br /><br />I can't really quite figure out what audience the movie targeted but clearly not the kids, and hardly parents.
1416589473|3.0|It could have been better. It seems like the writer is not really that talented but I love the Guildwars lore. It basically tells a story that includes the sylvari and asura (they are not as greedy and evil as you'd think). There is a good look at the foefire and some shenanigans that give you a feel of how the char, sylvari, and asura think. Must read for fans- but the writing is pretty bad.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|If you like playing games like Cityville, Farmville, Castleville, etc., then this is the kind of game for you. I was expecting it to be a little more detailed and interactive than that, so it was a little disappointing, especially remembering the Oregon Trail game I used to play when I was in elementary school. However, for what it is, it wasn't bad at all - until there was a major glitch and everything was taking more than 400 hours to collect, update, harvest, etc. Good thing it's free, because I wouldn't recommend that anyone actually spend money on this app because the glitch makes the game unplayable.
B0086700CM|5.0|Despite the fact that it has no end this game is AWESOME!!! Best game I have ever played in<br />2011! It's too easy though.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|In my opinion, this hidden object game is definitely better than most of the hidden object games I come across. The Steampunk style is what caught my eye initially and I liked the graphics in general (especially compared to other games of the same genre). I would have liked it to be slightly more difficult and I wouldn't have minded it being longer either, but don't get me wrong, it's still a decent length. I just have a tendency, when I have nothing better going on, to sit there playing straight through; which is why a bit more difficulty would have made the game last longer for me. Unfortunately, I can't see there being much replay value, but with hidden object games that pretty much to be expected. I saw a couple of other people mention glitches (fixable ones) in their games but I didn't experience any in mine. For $.99 I can't really see anyone going wrong with purchasing this.
0345803507|1.0|I had to \\"safe-word\\" book three, it was that bad.  Horribly written.  No plot.  Vague, stupid, mind-numbing story-telling about minutiae.  The least threatening, most absent, completely impotent villain ever created just to give the author an excuse to add a useless book to this series.  Repetitive sex scenes that just tire you (you know it's bad when you're skipping the sex scenes to hunt down a non-existent story in a book you undoubtedly selected for its escapism).  Book two was weak.  Book three is just one eye-rolly moment after the next.  You'll find yourself taking frequent breaks from it's stupidity and tediousness.  Or maybe that was just me.  I've actually not even finished book three, and at this point, I'm doubting I ever will.  I read book one in less than 24 hours.  This...is just garbage.<br /><br />Let me save you some money and time.  My recap of Freed: He's a child.  Period.  I don't care if he's hot.  And my goodness, we get it.  He's hot.  His looks are mentioned three, four times on every page.  Hey, author, we're reading here!  Let's move this story along.<br /><br />She's a doormat, who fancies herself insightful, and she's somewhat of a moron.  Her inner dialogue is at all times some variation of \\"oh my\\" or \\"oh crap\\" or \\"oh f---\\" or \\"oh sh--\\" though she's supposed to be a literary intellectual--an actual editor!  I'd bet good money at this point that EL James has never--NEVER--actually met an editor.<br /><br />They argue.  She gives in, every time.  Not 'cause he's right.  Nope.  Just 'cause he's pretty. And you never get the chance to forget that.  They screw, multiple times a day, and it's old and predictable and exhausting.  Crap happens--uncompelling crap without any sense of reality-- just to give them a reason to argue and then screw.  When they're not arguing and screwing, they're just screwing.  And MY GOD it's boring.  Who'd a thunk it?  They live happily ever after.  There.  I saved you from the tragic waste of time book three is.Be grateful.  Book one, for all its faults, was at least interesting.  This...just sucks.<br /><br />Laters, baby.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing so much about this book, I decided to purchase it on my Kindle. Now MY 'inner goddess' wants to scream, \\"What a waste of money!!!\\" The entire premise of this book is so far-fetched and implausible. The book reads as if a teenager, possibly someone who is thirteen years old, wrote it- I don't want to insult any thirteen year olds out there, so my apologies. Repetitive, redundant, ridiculous are the three R's that comes to mind. Characters are all one dimensional, shallow, idiots. Why would someone supposedly as attractive and smart as the main character fall for an older guy with as much baggage as an airport carousel?  Why did he choose her? Lame, weak and reductive plot. It reminded me of the vampire story from a few years ago that I suffered through.  Pull the shades down on this one. If I could give it negative stars I would.

1452101248|5.0|I knew I had to have this book about 20 seconds after I opened it. The beautiful pictures drew me right in. I have been a vegetarian for over 30 years, and I own my share of vegetarian cookbooks. Here are a few things that make this one a stand out.<br />1.) The flavor combinations are unique, fresh and interesting. Watermelon and feta salad with basil leaves and olive oil. I never would have thought of it, but it is delicious!<br />2.) Many of the recipes are egg-free. I don't love eggs, and many vegetarian cookbooks are heavy on them. Not this one.<br />3.) Many of the recipes are VERY easy. This is unusual for a vegetarian cookbook. The dishes are special because of the thoughtful and creative combination of flavors in a few ingredients. Some only take a few minutes to prepare. Nothing in here is unduly fussy.<br />And the final reason, for which I shall be eternally grateful to Mr. Ottolenghi...<br />4.) It has turned my ten-year-old picky eater daughter into a foodie! I'm not sure if it is because of the beautiful photos, or whether some hormonal thing FINALLY kicked in, or because after all these years of eating only pasta, rice, and bread her body is so starved for nutrients, but she carefully combed through the book, picked out recipes, and made shopping lists. The other night, she ate the watermelon and feta salad for dinner. (She doesn't usually even like watermelon.) This morning, she is eating left-over mushroom polenta for breakfast! Instead of waffles!
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is Soo good. I used to play it on my bro's ipod and when I got my kindle I wanted it rly bad but of course I got my kindle on Christmas so I had to wait to get this but since I got it everything about it is amazing!!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Wow, this series of movies is so much fun to watch. Never takes itself too seriously, but always delivers with heart-pounding action scenes. Sandstorm anyone?
B000QUCNOK|4.0|A friend suggested this movie. As I watched, I was blown away by the uniqueness of the story. I loved it. I was getting ready to tell everyone I know that there is a great movie to rent, something like they'd never seen before. Unfortunately, what had the opportunity to be great left me feeling disconnected in the end. I think what was gained by the ending's originality didn't work. It left me disappointed.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Fantastic! I cannot say enough good things about this book. It was so much fun and very exciting, some parts had me on the edge of my seat. I did not want to put this book down. If you grew up in the 80s and/or have an interest in 80s pop culture, this book is a must read (even if you weren't/aren't into gaming). I think it's still a great book even if you don't know much about 80s pop culture (everything is explained in detail). It might lose a little of the \\"fun\\" factor (for example, I got a kick out of thinking \\"I know that movie and love it too\\" or \\"OMG, I listened to that album\\"), however, even without the familiarity with the 80s material, the story itself is fast-paced, unique and very exciting.<br /><br />I listened to a little less than half of it on audio (Wil Wheaton does an amazing job narrating!!!) however, I got so drawn into it that I decided that I wanted to read it faster than I could listen to it so I bought it on Kindle and finished it less than 24 hours after buying it.<br /><br />Whether you listen to it or read it, I highly recommend this book!
B0086700CM|1.0|will not install on android  2.2 devices or download would give it 5 stars if the app would work for theses type of phones
B005LAIGJQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the overall message of this movie.. There were moments I laughed out loud - but there were times I felt the storyline/plot went South - but at the end everything came together. I love they casted Ruby Dee as Eddie Murphy's mom. Ruby Dee showed us that no matter what the script offers - when you are blessed with talent - you can make anything shine.<br /><br />3.5 Stars
0545265355|4.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is a book that breaks what are complex novels such as Animal Farm and 1984 (or Anthem) down to a level that is engaging and packaged to suit teenagers.<br /><br />Realistically, there are no real surprises here, from the start of book one to the end of book three the outcome is virtually assured. Not because book is predictable, but the political climate in which it was written is: The Oppressed will clash with the Oppressor and we will all regain our freedom. That's not what makes this book interesting, what is, is that it is written in a way that makes you care about the rather obnoxious main character and her teenage angst fueled inner monologue about how everything ever is up to her.<br /><br />Her mother is useless, her younger sister is vulnerable, her father is dead and even the men in her life are incapable of really surviving without her, except the boy she likes, he's like ... totally dreamy. And although, it's never put quite so succinctly (with exception of her mother, which is repeatedly lamented), the teenage self involvement definitely shines through on every page.<br /><br />Still, despite this rather elementary let down, the story is engaging and makes you interested in how things are going to play out, even if there never is any doubt of what the destination will be. That's not to say the journey there isn't filled with twists and turns but always it comes back to the weight of the world resting on the heroine's shoulders, with the realizations and reflections that others did prepare her being at best a fleeting ghost and memory if her father, even if she does at various times drag a prep-team and mentor around, this never appears to truly enter her frame of mind.<br /><br />Overall the world of Hunger Games is a distopia, with doublthink and misinformation being the order of the day for the different people in the world. The primary villain is a typical Stalin'esque evildoer that wrested power through manipulation and murder. The primary focus (the Hunger Games themselves) are children fighting to the death and the odds of individuals being chosen being directly proportional to the extent of their families suffering. Both of these factors clearly are designed to draw you in and again our current, western political climate is definitely the target environment, making this novel suitable to both adults and children. Though adults will likely view the self centered reflections as distracting and annoying. Not being a teenager myself anymore I can only assume that this will allow some to relate, even if their life is never as bleak as the book reflects, or worse, as the main character presents.<br /><br />The book is thin (~400 pages each), with large print and few words per page meaning that each book can, with some dedication, easily be read in a weekend or less. The story arcs of the three books repeats itself with an introduction, a preparation to fight and finally a fight. And this same three stage approach itself applies to the overall series. Personally, despite being predictable in the overall arc, the story itself kept me reading and go straight into the next book.<br /><br />In some ways I hope Collins does do the right thing and follow up with another novel (or series) to show what now happens in this world post liberation. Then again this seems unlikely, but I guess is a good indication that I liked the setting and the topics, which Collins herself states are based on Greek mythology and thus are timeless, albeit re-interpreted for a current audience.<br /><br />One final note: the book is told from Katniss's perspective, while the movie provides information to the viewer the characters do not know. Clearly there are considerations of medium which are suited to each approach, but I find it interesting that James Clavell's Shogun was treated in the reverse way, with the mini series being character focused, while the book deals with the entire world.er.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|Good game; fun for adults and kids.  teaches time management.  requires you to keep coming back to maintain your village.
034580404X|5.0|I've got to say, this is probably the best book that I have read in the last decade. I dont understand the criticisms about this book. The comparison to the twilight books is completely ridiculous because for those who made that comparison, the twilight series is probably the only other books that you've ever read. My likings for this book consist of a number of this things. First of all, the language is precise.It is not ourageously vulgar or mediocre, it is to the point where there is not one scene or idea that is hard to comprehend. The story line is well structured no matter where the author's inspiration came from. She oviously has done her reseach for her to write three books consisting of over 500 pages. This is the part that I admire the most about her writing.<br />  Most people think it's fast read and hence they read it exactly at that. This book should be read with a openminded attitude and should be read as if you are trying to solve a puzzle. A quick read will not make you enjoy this book because apart from all the sex scences,it has a lot of feelings and to understand exactly what's going on you have to read it with a soothing mind. Young people who are trying to date or who are actually dating should read this book because it has a sense of sexual satisfaction, romantic satisfaction and everything else that comes with being in love. Some say it is not practical, well or course it is practical and people do have relationships like this, but it doesnt make them monsters as people sees Cristian Grey to be. It just a matter of how much and what extent you enjoy your sex life. The author is sprecific as to why she designed Christian that way, to show what love can do to a broken soul. Read people!!!! Between the lines of this novel. Dont give it a quick read. Cause you will miss out on the sensual aspect.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I am really happy that I purchased this CD. We just got back from Hawaii and loved the music we heard there. It's very pretty, serene and calming. I highly recommend!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is a great way to relax and stretch my brain. Some puzzles stump me for a while but then I will come back with fresh eyes and pull it off, resulting in great satisfaction.
0307730697|5.0|On Tuesday as I made my way to Boston I opened my book that I had brought for the flight up entitled Fearless by Eric Blehm. I don't know much about Navy SEALS or Team SIX so when I saw this book was up for review I figured I could probably learn a lot about a branch of the military I am not as familiar with. Little did I know I was in for the story of a man whose life went from walking the straight and narrow to running from God into drugs and then turning his life around and becoming a Navy SEAL. His personal story told in the book by his family and friends to the author is one that is filled with personal struggles and physical challenges but above all a fearless attitude that made him into one of our national's most elite warriors. I feel like I got to know Adam Brown through the eyes of those closest to him and when I finished the book I felt sad that there was nothing more to learn of this great man who made the ultimate sacrifice doing what he did best: volunteering to do the tough jobs, defending his brothers, and serving his country.  Reading his fellow Navy SEALs accounts of his compassion in a warzone, his toughness in battle which often left him bloody but saying \\"it's all good\\" as he helped someone else, and his sense of humor quickly made him feel like someone I had known for years. I won't go into detail about much because I don't want to ruin the best parts of the story but I will say that as the book goes on and he embarks on his final mission my heart broke. I cried on the plane and I'm crying as I type this now. While I know that Adam Brown's story is one of the many of those who have fallen while defending this great nation,  the life lessons I gleaned from his story will be ones I will carry with me always. It is amazing what happens when a man allows God to lead, guide, and direct all areas of his life.<br /><br />I received this book free of charge from the Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers in exchange for my honest review.
B000VSYDRM|3.0|yeah...that about sums it up. i'm not even sure i know what the moral of the story was here. if you lean toward the gratuitously disgusting and demented, this one's for you.
0684135051|1.0|I agree with the reviewer who was disappointed because there are no pictures.  I didn't realize that I was a visual learner, but when I received this book I felt that it was almost useless to me.  I am going to chalk this purchase up to \\"lessons learned\\".  This was my error, not the book or author's fault.  But if you expect a fun, easy to use book with lots of drawings, (i.e Stitch and Bitch, or Knit Girl), this is not for you.  Happy Knitting!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Bought this book on a whim based on others recommendations. Did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. But I didn't want to put the book down until I finished it. The premise is unrealistic and since it is similar to TV reality shows, which I never watch, I really didn't think it would be as good as it was.  Well written and highly enjoyable.
B007SSEU9O|1.0|After seeing this movie I have very little to say. The acting by Meryl Streep is superb and I always enjoy the characters she plays, but the movie left little to desire. It is a look back at her life from her memory and it is to choppy and pieced together to enjoy the life of the iron lady herself.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is very fun when you have extra time you should definitely get it for your iphone or kindle fire
B0041D843M|5.0|The American diet is a big (fat) lie.  Powerful, dishonest people are killing you, telling you lies for profit.  What is at stake is up to and including your and your children's lives.  Read this book and get some facts.  Then move on however you wish....

B001CZVVVO|5.0|I have owned this concert for several years now, first as a DVD then as a Blu-ray. Every time I watch it I find it to be utterly uplifting, so good that it is almost impossible to comment about it without seeming to be wildly extreme!<br /><br />The content of the concert is ideal with a perfect blend of variety, in mood and in pace and where the orchestral items form ideal bridging moments and are also excellent in themselves.<br /><br />In a concert of superlatives one can only really pick out the most memorable moments. The first memorable moment for me is Netrebko's dark and creamy `O mio babbino caro' but not for long! The very next number is Villazon's `Ah! Parais! Parais, aster de mon ciel' from Massenet's Le Mage and arguably the finest single track I have ever heard him sing.<br /><br />Domingo is not to be outdone as he raises the crowd to their collective feet in `No puede ser' from La tabernera del Puerto. Netrebko entrances everyone with Lehar's `My lips' and amazingly fills the stadium when she leaves the microphones at the end of Musetta's `Quando men vo' and the crowd clap enthusiastically through Rossini's `La Danza', once the preserve of Pavarotti.<br /><br />The orchestra is not to be outdone with a fine performance of Rossini's Semiramide Overture conducted by Marco Armiliato.<br /><br />Finally all three singers combine to enormous applause as they share Verdi's `Libiamo ne lieti calici' and Lehar's `Dein ist meinganzes Herz' and the camera, scanning across the packed audience at the end, even manages to pick out Gustavo Dudamel on his feet and cheering fit to burst like so many others.<br /><br />This entirely wonderful experience is captured in spectacular HD imaging and equally wide ranging sound presented in DTS-HD 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo. The bonus is your own guaranteed pleasure! This has to be a 5 star issue and is truly phenomenal.hat may offer further help:<br /><br />I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one. Your assessments and opinions are invaluable. Thank you. (US review)<br /><br />I particularly like your format of review. They give the prospective purchaser an idea of the style of the playing and relevant comparisons. They are succinct. Keep up the good work! (UK review)<br /><br />I'm sure there are many other serious collectors, besides myself, who wait for your synopsis and opinion before spending their hard-earned money on new releases...<br />Thank you (UK review)<br /><br />I'd also add to this. When you in particular review a particular CD, I pay pretty close attention. I would say the characteristics of your reviews I value the most are the detail and general sense of balance and fairness that comes across. That's a great help. Thanks for taking the time on your reviews.  (US review)<br /><br />............................................
034580404X|3.0|I enjoyed the first book. Very thought provoking and an interesting insight into characters that evoke the \\"aha\\" reaction.<br />The second book was okay, the third book was overkill.
B0074Y2YZ4|3.0|I expected this album to be forgettable, and it stood *down* to my expectations. I've been a huge Roxette fan for 23 years. (I live in the US by the way.) But the sad fact is, Roxette hasn't released a great album since \\"Have a Nice Day\\" in the late 90s.<br /><br />Of course, if you're a fan, you'll listen to this album.<br /><br />By the way, one of the best songs they cut in recent years is an almost unknown B-side called \\"Bad Moon\\". I don't know why they don't just cut a proper studio version of that song.
B007SGM084|5.0|A must read for every woman, especially when you are trying to make a baby, lol! Would recommend to woman of all ages. Did not want it to end!
030758836X|2.0|The book started out interesting - not captivating, just a good enough read. I didn't really like any of the main characters much, they were not likable or unique enough for me to say I was really interested in either of them. As has been stated before about a third of the way through, the story stagnates just before the huge twist comes. Then the book became more interesting; I was engaged and eager to see what came next. Then about 3/4th of the way through, the plot, actions and thoughts became unbelievable. From that point the storyline continued it's downward trend and then dug itself in a hole all the way to the end. I am sorry I spent the time reading this book.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I could spend hours playing with these puzzles.  The graphics are great!  And you can increase the difficulty along the way by increasing the number of pieces.  I think anyone would find this app enjoyable.
B000V1Z8KK|3.0|If you can get past the basic premise and story background, it is a decent movie that takes into account a reasonable amount of the physics that goes into being a sniper. It still has a lot of Hollywood-isms, but from that aspect it is a decent action film.<br /><br />The main problem was that I had trouble getting past the background and premise where the US Government knowingly and intentionally backstabs one of their best and most talented snipers, twice. It goes against basic military credo and basic common sense. The military has a whole culture built around \\"Leave no one behind\\" and the movie immediately starts out with them intentionally leaving Mark Wahlberg and his spotter to die. Missions do go wrong and people can get left behind, but they will always go back for them and would never do it intentionally.<br /><br />Even without \\"Leave no one behind\\", a sniper as good as Mark Wahlberg's character is so valuable and rare that no one in their right mind would willingly sacrifice him because they're so hard to find.<br /><br />So, if you are just looking for some entertainment it is fine, but I found the premise too far fetched to suspend disbelief.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|As is the case with almost all ghost stories from the UK, the skill in crafting an eerie and surreal version of the book by Susan Hill is palpable. As is evident by Susan Hill's book, and M R James' stories, the British  skill of the things at the periphery of one's vision is amazing. I would not recommend reading the book before seeing the film, however, that being said, if you have, it will not destroy your enjoyment of the film if you do. Daniel Radcliffe delivers a stellar on camera performance, and the very well chosen cast makes this story a delivered work on a brilliant level. Even the lower level scares make for some great fun in the ghost story.The commentary is well worth listening to, just as the features show a lot more of the extras. I would guess that most people will mist some of the sights out of direct vision. The locations are very well chosen, and some of these are revealed in the commentary, but so long as you go along for the ride, this is a brilliant work. I watched the film in the theatre and on one \\"cheap\\" scare a young woman just about pierced my ear drums, but strangely enough on the more surreal elements, she was not scared ( I can only assume she was in shock). Excellent film, great in all respects.<br />  Regarding the Ultraviolet copy: Don't bother. The inconvenience of setting up two accounts, and the lack of certainty first of all of any sort of availability is a problem, and the limit of Ultraviolet access beyond a few years is farcical. Insist on actual digital copies for your portable device because the cloud is an issue that will haunt your personal details, and if they do not fix security and infrastructure, Ultraviolet is another cloud idea that is a pipe dream. For a digital copy it is not worth the problem, since there are other ways to get digital copies, and IMO the companies should provide a copy in a proper digital format.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|It has not won a ton of Emmy's for no reason.  Best series ever, fantastic writing and acting.  Amazing and riveting.
0345803493|3.0|While this book keeps up the same form and content as the first of the trilogy,it reads a bit slower. It is easier to put down.  I found the original Ana, with all her innocence and righteous indignation, to have an equal amount of gumption.  Frankly, this Ana is a bit more boring.  And dare I say, Christian, comes off as more vanilla.  After book one, my girlfritthink it calls for a new fresh face, someone the audience would have to get to know, as we we got to know Ana. I preferred her strenghth in the first book, and I keep waiting for that woman with gumption to return in the second.  All of this moot, of course, as I still intend to finish the trilogy when I read \\"50 Shades Free\\".  I am enjoying the \\"mindless\\" read which is taking me through summer a little oo quickly. I would give the first book, I would definatley giveit 5 stars.  The second gets 3 so far, and I'll let ypou know\
B00433TO52|1.0|PLEASE don't buy this edition.<br /><br />I just read a few pages of Cymbeline and it's BAD. The spelling is all wrong (come on, it's not olde english when the u's and v's are switched and \\"for\\" is written as \\"forre\\" and \\"he\\" is \\"hee\\") and the formatting is terrible.<br />When I googled a line (just to make sure it wasn't just me) I found an online text and I'm pretty sure the \\"publishers\\" just copied and pasted the text from online to make the book. Let's put it this way... Let's pretend that you paid someone to type out each play and sold the final result. Who cares if you misspell words, leave no periods, and jumble names together. RIGHT? I mean honestly, that's what this \\"book\\" looks like.<br /><br />I deleted it from my Kindle, pretty disgusted with the purchase. I could understand if it was free (*look up Hamlet or the more popular plays individually, they might be free*) but I mean I could have bought at least a McDouble and an apple pie or a cookie with 1.99. I'd rather be eating a McDouble and an apple pie.<br /><br />So I downloaded the OrangeSkyProject team version [[ASIN:B0052GA9D0 The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [with active TOC]]] because it's $1.99 as well and it's working much better. Formatting is much better and the spelling seems alright. The only downside is scrolling through the table of contents which is arranged alphabetically but I don't think it matters once you get to the play you want.<br /><br />**Oh and to everyone: you can always get to the table of contents if the book has one, press menu and scroll to \\"go to\\" on your kindle. select table of contents and it will take you there.<br /><br />In conclusion, don't buy, and have a nice day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome games,  the best. I love it its so cool good for kids so much puzzles so much fun cool
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book delves more deeply into the characters and gives you a real picture of the times.  I think  I liked this even more than the first, if that is possible.
B007N31YH0|5.0|I hadn't seen this film in many years and had forgotten what a truly great movie it is.  It is timeless and I don't think it is a movie that could be re-made to be as good as the original.  Outstanding!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I have been curious about this young lady since I heard her dubbed as worst snl performer ever! i took a gamble and purchased the entire album and i must say im very happy to add this to my top 2012 list! Some ppl say its boring imop its slow paced for the most part which i enjoy ballads done by females but there are a few faster pace songs as well (see Diet Mt Dew, Off To The Races) so i gave the entire album a listen and loving it more n more! Anyone will agree that these days its rare to have a album great from front to back and this  is prime example of that! My favs are the title track, dark paradise, without you, what makes us girls, and video games. the only one thats not my fav is lucky ones but 14 out of 15 songs is way above average so do yourself a favor and buy this on amazon for 5 bucks (standard edition) and youll be very impressedd w this ones song writing and melodies! thanx for reading :)
B0019UGYK0|5.0|This is one of my three all time favorite movies and has been since I saw it when it first came out.  In my opinion it's Newman's best performance.  This copy is a birthday gift for my youngest son, appropriately named Luke, as he loves the movie, but only has it on VHS and his copy is nearly worn out.  It's the only thing that he actually asked for and I am happy to oblige him.  For all Newman buffs this is a \\"must have\\" for your collection.
B003ASLJPY|5.0|Like lots of America kids, I was raised on heroic tales of America's history in World War II. Its images, among them the iconic flag-raising at Iwo Jima, were forever seared into my imagination. Not to mention that I happened to grow up in the town that lays claim to Rene Gagnon, one of the flag-raisers!<br /><br />I don't think it ever occurred to me that there was another side to the story, that of the faceless enemy that hid in caves and bunkers, lying in wait to slaughter our brave boys.<br /><br />\\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is director Client Eastwood's attempt to humanize the Japanese and show the fight from their side. The story focuses on General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) sho is unusual or a Japanese military man - he carefully plans the battle, with a clear-eyed assessment of the strengths and tactics of his enemy. That puts him at odds with many of his colleagues, who have no respect for the Americans as warriors and presume an easy victory over them. The rank and file are represented by Private First Class Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a family man and simple baker placed in the crosshairs of history. Saigo's open and expressive face makes him the perfect antithesis to the dehumanized and faceless \\"Jap\\" that many of us grew up on. The film takes us from the preparations for the battle, the landing itself, the relentless pounding that the Japanese took rom air and sea and the desperate life living in tunnels clawed from the volcanic rock.<br /><br />If anything, the film swings perhaps a bit too far toward defanging the Japanese. They are portrayed as poor grunts riven to work by a few obsessively crazed superiors. They empathize with wounded Americans. General Kuribayashi is often shown writing sad letters home to his family. Except for a few madly patriotic soldiers, most of the island's defenders just seem ready to go home. I hate to spoil the party, but Iwo's garrison had dug 11 miles of tunnels into rock. Perhaps not all were political fanatics, but it seems to me that it would take more than a half-hearted attempt to accomplish that feat!<br /><br />Nonetheless, \\"Letters from Iwo Jim\\" is a success, and gives a small taste of what the battle might have looked like from the other end of US Marine and Navy guns. A worthy companions to \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" Eastwood's companion piece from the American point of view.but it seems to me that it would take more than a half-hearted attempt to accomplish that feat!<br /><br />Nonetheless, \\"Letters from Iwo Jim\\" is a success, and gives a small taste of what the battle might have looked like from the other end of US Marine and Navy guns.

B000GCFY0I|5.0|Could not put it down soo good read the series!So worth six ninty nine. Very good. Just rent the extras it was not that great but the first three awsome.
0345803485|1.0|... she skimmed it an told me it was drek. I guess it floats some boats and sink others. She really could not have been less interested and is not sure what all the fuss was about. Which come to think of it, died pretty quickly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really fun game I liked it because it is like the game for the nintendo ds funnnnnnnnnnn
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This show never disappoints, one of my favorite series ever! Very intriguing storyline, always something interesting & different to look forward to. I love Sam & Dean!!!
B001609SQA|1.0|The idea of having not just one but an army of aliens to fight was interesting. But that's about all that is interesting about this sequel. James Cameron could not resist making another childish movie with simplistic characters (the soldiers), unrealistic relations we just don't care about (Ripley and the girl), and stupid robot scenes.
B003L77GGK|5.0|This series never disappoints, it's been great from the beginning & just keeps getting better! I love Sam & Dean!!!
B00313PLIO|5.0|The movie is a gem. Extremely funny and entertaining, yet you get to peek at the complex political events that unfolding in Iran over the last few decades. Universally touching.

159448385X|5.0|As a Westerner, you may look at the cover of this book wondering if you will manage to relate to the Afghan characters. You will! Stop hesitating and dive into this universally moving story. Not only will you care about the characters but you'll will experience an emotional roller-coaster with them: hope, anger, despair, happiness, etc. You will care so much that at times you'll even feel \\"mad\\" at the author for the event spins... If you liked The Kite Runner, you will like this one just as much, and then your friends and you will keep debating over the issue of which book is best (not easy to tell).

B006OCM0G0|4.0|game is decent. be careful if u have little kids playing as its fairly easy to accidentally spend $10+. other than that my only real complaint is not having the ability to click a button when u visit someone to add them as ur neighbor or even have their User name next to their restaurant name so u can add. pretty good though.

B006LMMN8I|5.0|With a name like SAXTON , one would think you might know a little somin' somin' about jazz ! NOT , your clueless ! This CD is the best music I've bought in years . (maybe decades !) Perfect sound , vocals , instro, great lyrics , arrangement ...<br />Word of advice , stop reviewing music until you have a better audio system to listen to it , then again maybe you need a better BRAIN ! Gregory Porter told you to Be Good , why won't you listen to the man Mr. Jerry J. ?
0887431453|5.0|I ordered this for my 2 year old son, hoping he would enjoy it.  Since he's only 2, I put all the pages inside individual page protectors,bound them in a binder, and let him go to town on them with dry erase crayons.  He loves it.  With over 300 pages to choose from, he can use this book for a couple years & never get tired of doing the same thing.<br />The book is broken into sections.  There's a section where you \\"follow the path\\" starting from straight lines to curved lines, and ending with mazes.  Then there's letters (A is for...), numbers (Can you find 7 ____), colors& shapes (Color the triangles purple), along with other beginner things.<br /><br />Overall it's an activity book that children will love without realizing that they are learning because it's so much fun.  I would recommend this book to anyone with kids aged 2-5.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book is a little scattered but if you take the time to get into all the characters they won't disappoint you. Also some of the storylines have been left behind as well. Looking forward to the next one!
B004KZDV8E|5.0|My last gaming rig was an Intel Z68 motherboard with an i7-2600K overclocked to 4.7ghz, with a GTX580 as the GPU. I sold those two parts because I needed the $800. I recently bought a used i3-2120 for $100 and a used GTX280 for $65, plugged them into the same old motherboard and away we go. Honestly, I can't tell much difference in games.<br /><br />In BF3 I changed the graphics settings from Ultra to High and I'm not giving up a lot in terms of visuals compared to the gtx580 setup, and gameplay seems about the same. Load times are good, the system is responsive. Everything plays well, Crysis, COD, at 1920x1200.<br /><br />Point is, for gaming this CPU seems about as good as an I7-2600k. You could put the money you save towards a better GPU. That is where you will get more fps and better visuals. Incidentally the gtx280 is still a very good card, plays modern games well (but no DX11) and a used one can be picked up for very cheap.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />been having problems with my gtx280 crashing randomly (pink screen of death - bad vram), so I replaced it with my even older 8800GT 512mb. BF3 plays nice and smooth with graphics set to Low, at 1920x1200. Doesn't look as quite as smooth but looks great and it plays really well! By the way, the 8800GT is still a very powerful GPU and can be had for next to nothing.
B004IQ78HA|3.0|I'm a fan of top-of-the-line cartooning, and happily recognize that Disney is among the masters (the relatively little-known \\"Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\\" is one of my favorites).  True, recent ones haven't been up to par -- too treacly, preachy, or, worst of all, politically correct.  But 1951's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" has all the artistry, charm, and magic one expects from Disney's Golden Age.  That being said, and despite some terrific moments and scenes, I was dismayed by the lack of thought and effort that went into this interpretation of the Lewis Carroll classic.  In addition to some unexpected tedium, the plot was disjointed, and never really built on itself or went anywhere.  Worst of all was the ending, which was abrupt and unsatisfying.  All in all, a very flat production that I regretfully can't recommend.
B00881VLCE|4.0|fun and challenging I really enjoy doing puzzles this way I don't have to worry about kids loosing pieces or ruining my progress
B007SGM084|5.0|An easy, sexy and very entertaining read! I've reccommended this series to all of my girlfriends! Definitely a must read!
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|Linkin park has changed so much I dont feel like I can rock out to this album at all because it's mostly just emotional songs, hybrid theory is way better.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|its a great game and if it weren't for this issue I would be playing it right now,  the problem is I was level 49 and was a couple of upgrades away from being maced out when all of a sudden it resents the game and I am level 49 with no skills and no way to gain experience points and woefully outmatched
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this series (3 books). The author paints a picture with words that is so clear that it's almost like watching a movie. Once I started reading, I couldn't put the books down and was left wanting more when I finished the series. But not because I didn't like the ending, it ended in such a way that felt complete...I don't want to go into details because I don't want to give anything away, as it's much better to read it for yourself.<br /><br />Women were talking about this book EVERYWHERE from supermarkets to hair salons to FaceBook!  What I noticed is that everyone seemed to feel the same way as I do about these books, except for the younger, unmarried women.<br /><br />This series is very sexually explicit.
B005HSL626|5.0|The reason I love this app so much is because you have a choice of what the backgrounds,blades and its free

B007IXWKUK|4.0|In the end, I really enjoyed all three novels in this trilogy. Ok, so they weren't the best edited novels, the writing was fine. It's the story that drew me in. I love the whole awakening of Ana's desire, and I loved Christian's story. It was fun to read, easy to read, and made me want to read the next book. Haters will hate merely because of the book's success.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it does so much and is so well designed, especially being free. love the radar feature. it scrolls with ease to see today's forecast.
B005KELR3A|5.0|This case is perfect!  Seems to be holding up well.  It's a perfect fit for the kindle touch (some might think it's a bit small), but the kindle fits well and it's well protected.  Pleased with my purchase.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|Firstly, I personaly Love Neil's Americana. It has a cool rockin' easy flowing vibe. Open your heart & mind & It'll take you awaaaaaay. Just like Neil's verrrrrry best music/art. That's just my opinion. What I can understand is \\"some\\" having differing view points. What I can't understand or fathom, is \\"some\\", who obviously do not currently like, respect or appreciare Neil, that take the time to write negative, derrogatory, put-downs upon his music, integrity & intentions. I personally dislike many bands, musicians & songs, but would NEVER even contemplate writing a negative review of their music. Sooooooo SAD....That sooooooo many of you ought to be ashamed of yourselves for attacking & degrading a unique, gifted artist who only brings joy & happiness to our world ...go get a life!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|After browsing through my Amazon recommendations I came across The Maze Runner.  I was a little bit worried it would be too much like the Hunger Games, but I was totally hooked by this book and couldn't put it down.  Has a tendency to be written more for a younger audience and the slang/made up language gets old quickly, but definitely work the time.  I'm on to book three and I've enjoyed every minute!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|great movie, great fx, great story, tharks where very well done, Dejah is super hot, you will love totally it
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book was a fast, fascinating, and heart-wrenching story of Shin, a North Korean refugee.  Beyond his personal story is current researched information about life in North Korea, life in political camps, current escape techniques, and political relationships and tensions.  If you're wanting to understand the most repressed country on the planet, this is the read for you.
1475143389|5.0|This book was great. Mr. Matthews provides many helpful tools and tips on getting the body of your dreams. His program also looks promising, it's very simple and seems if you follow the process it's impossible to not gain results. A MUST BUY!
B003L77G06|1.0|I was disappointed.<br /><br />The plastic wrap was all stuck on the spine of the DVD case. The sticker (or seal) on top of the DVD player was REALLY hard to take off. Very, very stock and after I finally managed to take off the seal, it left tons of stickyness on the case.<br /><br />The quality of the print on the disks are bad. The DVD case is really cheap, made cheap, very flimsy, smells like chemicals, and it doesn't even properly keep the disks in place (the disks keep falling off).<br /><br />What's worse, the disk doesn't work properly. It stops every other minute and drives me nuts.<br /><br />I love the show. I really do. I was so excited to receive the DVD... But the quality of the disk, its prints, its case... I mean, how wrong can you get with a DVD set... it looks like something they made illegally.<br /><br />Be aware of Moveez&More
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Not as terrible as book 4, but a close second. What I have noticed is that you can skip entire chapters and will have missed nothing. Or just read the first and the last 2 or 3 pages of each chapter to keep up with the story that has become less interesting as it unfolds.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|I vividly remember when this was released in theatres--Opera News had written about it.  The \\"sound track\\" was a Musical Heritage Society feature.  The film was shot on location with the singers lip-synching themselves.  And what singers they are! Though it's pertinent to the story I've never been able to watch the bull-fighting sequence in the beginning.  Other than that this is 1) a wonderful way to savor a gorgeous opera 2)an absolute delight to share and 3)one would hope 'twould produce an entire new audience for the art form.
0984999302|5.0|Steve Blank and co-author Bob Dorf provide a detailed, practical, step-by-step guide to creating a business. The details may seem repetitive and less than thrilling at times (and they warn the reader about this at the beginning), but in focusing on the nitty-gritty they give you a thorough grounding where Eric Ries' \\"The Lean Startup\\" may have left you with only a partial understanding.<br /><br />The book is well organized, building on Steve Blank's earlier work on the Customer Development Process. The steps may or may not always happen in exactly this sequence, but the step-by-step format is helpful to the reader who needs to make sense of it all.<br /><br />Blank and Dorf make good use of Alexander Osterwalder's \\"Business Model Canvas\\". Blank has fully integrated Osterwalder's framework into his own model and teachings.<br /><br />The integrated package makes for a very different curriculum than what they tend to teach you at business school.<br /><br />Go to Steve Blank's website to see what impact these ideas are having.

1400069289|4.0|I read this for a book club that I'm in and was skeptical at first but actually really enjoyed it. It gives a lot of insight into the human experience and why we do things we do. It also gives tips and pointers on how to apply the knowledge to your own life. Highly recommend!

0143119680|2.0|But it's not.<br /><br />This book is situated within an emerging genre I like. I don't have an exact name for the genre, so I'll call it something like \\"Scholar discovers mysterious, spooky shenanigans related to his/her academic research and then uses his/her training as a historian/anthropologist/sociologist/etc. to solve the mystery.\\"  For an excellent example of such a book, see The Historian.<br /><br />I really thought I would like this book.<br /><br />For the most part, I did not like this book.<br /><br />To be kind, I'll begin with what I liked about the book: the genre it's in; the scenery of Oxford; some of the historical details provided by the historian author; the fact that the main character is a reluctant witch. All this set me up with false hopes.<br /><br />What I find most irritating about this book are the two central characters, Diana and Matthew.  Like far too many teen books and trashy romances out there, the author uses Matthew's status as a 1500-year-old vampire to justify violence, extreme possessiveness, stalking, demands of obedience, and a pattern of isolating the heroine. This guy has nearly all of the qualities of a batterer, but we're *supposed* to find him charming. Sorry, I don't. By the end of the book, despite her growing witchy powers, he controls her every waking moment and watches her during her every sleeping moment. I get that some women find this \\"wives submit to your husbands\\" shit romantic, but I do not.<br /><br />Buffy would have staked this guy in the second chapter.<br /><br />On to the next major issue with the book:  The main character, Diana is, well, weak and milquetoast. You'd think a book about a chimera witch with every super power EVER would be an awesome tale to read, but, in this case, you'd be wrong.<br /><br />Finally, the book's major plot elements are quite repetitive, when you break them down. I can summarize 75% of the book in this way:<br /><br />Heroine is attacked.<br />Vampire saves heroine, whisking her off to her bed in his arms.<br />Heroine faints.<br />Upon waking, heroin eats some eggs.<br />Vampire commits an act of violence in retribution (and against the heroine's wishes).<br />Heroine recovers.<br />Vampire bosses around heroine.<br />They open a bottle of wine.<br /><br />Repeat that about ten times, and you'll cover most of the major plot points of the book.<br /><br />I tend to enjoy trilogies, but I don't think I'll be picking up the next two, unless someone alerts me to a shocking twist in the series in which Diana grows a spine and Matthew gets a nice wooden stake through the heart.ing her off to her bed in his arms.<br />Heroine faints.<br />Upon waking, heroin eats some eggs.<br />Vampire commits an act of violence in retribution (and against the heroine's wishes).<br />Heroine recovers.<br />Vampire bosses around heroine.<br />They open a bottle of wine.<br /><br />Repeat that about ten times, and you'll cover most of the major plot points of the book.<br /><br />I tend to enjoy trilogies, but I don't think I'll be picking up the next two, unless someone alerts me to a shocking twist in the series in which Diana grows a spine and Matthew gets a nice wooden stake through the heart.
B000OPOANE|5.0|I own all the studio albums by Rush, but held off getting Snakes and Arrows because I heard mixed reviews. I finally broke down and got it after \\"Clockwork Angels\\", and I'm very pleased I did . It's my first \\"audio DVD\\", cutting edge at the time, but not now, so my expectations were muted. But the \\"making of\\" video still played fine on my computer and made the album much more interesting to me. Except for the new Lion operating system on my Mac giving me some trouble transferring the music to my iPhone (PowerPC software is no longer supported), I've had zero problems. The artwork in the liner notes book is excellent, as I've come to expect for this underrated and long-loved power trio.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|certainly in my short list for worst. Predictable, crass, vulgar, little to laugh at. At first I thought it had potential but quickly learned I was wrong. I fell asleep about 30 min into it but other person watching said it got worse--and he's far less critical.

1583334386|5.0|Studies show that the two biggest determinants of success are intelligence and self-control.  While intelligence is developed through the majority of mainstream education, self-control is often not a focus.  This is unfortunate because just as traditional education facilitates the application of intelligence, likewise specific tools and techniques exist to raise a person's level of self-control.  This book details many such techniques.  Most are fairly obvious when you hear them--but that is precisely what makes them practical.  Examples include: learning to be aware of your lack of self-control before undesirable events actually occur; physiological aspects such as getting enough sleep, keeping your blood sugar up, and taking deep breaths when you're feeling challenged; switching \\"I won't\\" challenges into \\"I will\\" challenges; replacing the natural fight-or-flight emotional reaction with a pause-and-plan behavior; and learning to embrace your self-control weaknesses rather than fight them, which, ironically, makes them more controllable.  The author is a Ph.D. who teaches the topic at Stanford--so this is not just a feel-good, \\"You can do it!\\" book.  Instead, it is a very powerful toolbox that you can use every day.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really enjoyed this book! Didn't like 2/3 of the first one, but kept reading, and glad I did, book 2 of this series is great! Can't wait to read 3!

034580404X|4.0|When I bought the trilogy, I was expecting 'mommy porn'; the books were sexually explicit, but it was the story behind the surface that got and held my attention to the very last page.  They were a well written story of pain, coping, and finally healing.  I loved them.
B007XF0X6G|1.0|I hate to say this, but this movie was a train wreck. There was no real transition's between scenes, the action was all over the place, the dialog could have been better and the acting was very well done for what they were giving to work with. I would rate this a D Movie. I am sadden as well to say that I hope that, the sequal to: Percy Jackson and the Olympians,  is better then this made Sequal.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I downloaded the sample and still felt taken for a ride because it was a waste of time just to do that.  Within 6 pages, I'm thinking 'What?'  What is all the hype about.  I hadn't bothered to read the reviews so I went back and did.  I'm glad I didn't waste anymore time.  I don't know how many dollars they've made off this book but it didn't deserve any of them.  Please keep your teenage romance novels in it's own section....really!

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Cinder is totally number 1 in my dystopian list of books! It has the strong heroine named Cinder (With a Wow/Sci-Fi factor secret, of course), who will do everything in her power to save Earth (Even when some people are not that kind and understanding towards her), the mean stepmother, the sisters, and finally, the very cute, but smart and caring prince. It's a book you could read in a day because you get completely hooked since page one. I can't wait to read the second book! Go Cinder!<br /><br />*If you like Cinder, I also recommend Partials due that it's also about a strong minded young woman/medic! trying to save humanity (Also, unaware of her true potential). :)*
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read the First book in about a two days.  I am reading the trilogy for a book club in my home town.  I found it to be a little redunant.

0345479092|1.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend who said it's middle of the road. As others have stated, in some aspects it is, but in many others it is not. But what I disliked most is the condescending tone and insinuation that if I veered from the author's recommendations I would permanently ruin my child.

B006O6EOII|5.0|These Roller Maze dolls are among the cutest in the Monster High collection.  They all come with green streaks in their hear that adds quite a bit of color to their faces (with matching make up) and pink accents in the dresses.<br /><br />Roller Maze ghoulia comes with green streaks in her hair, which is tied into two large curls on either side of her head.  Her glasses have more of a racing shape and she comes with green eyeshadow to match the streaks.  She is wearing an overdress with blood spatter streaks in pink and an interesting pink mesh undershirt.  Pink Monster High shinguards and boots with translucent wheels that actually roll complete the look.  The heel of her black boots is a vertebrae andher helmet is a pink brain.<br /><br />The entire series of Monster High Roller Maze girls are great - very different from the regular Monster High dolls and MUCH better than the Dead Tired line.
B000VUCIZE|3.0|This is a book that will appeal to the high IQ reader.  For the rest of us, the treatment of Islam and its facets is the best part of the book, with points well made.  After that, I found it hard to comprend the rest of the points presented.

B007MDB71O|2.0|Being as I have read the entire John Carter series I found this movie very lacking. It would have been beter if they had have made a series of movies. Hell, it would have been better if it had been a movie series of the sci fi channel. They tried to shove far too many things into the movie and just lost the whole story. If it had even been close to the books it would have been a twenty hour movie. I would have been far happier if they would have just split it into more movies. It came close to being a B movie. Nuff said!

B0000542DJ|5.0|To begin to understand the whys and whats of the JFK assassination, this film is a<br />great place to start.  This Director's cut (Oliver Stone) gives an overwhelming<br />amount of information in a logical and coherent narrative. Film covers the attempt<br />to conduct a trial for someone alleged to be involved in the killing of JFK. Stone<br />weaves an intruiging narrative based on two books - \\"Crossfire\\" by Jim Marrs, and<br />\\"On the Trail of the Assassins\\" by Jim Garrison, who prosecuted the New Orleans<br />case in court.  He was the DA of New Orleans and took a lot of criticism from the<br />Federal government, which attempted to discredit him as a egotist out for publicity.

0765316994|2.0|This didn't work for me.  I couldn't bring myself to care enough.  A story based on art that admits it is art will struggle to get you to suspend disbelief or to engage.  Jasper Fforde manages it.  John Scalzi didn't.  Nor did it land many punches on the reputation of Star Trek.  Star Trek has many faults but, apart from lack of safety belts on the bridge, not really the ones this novel aimed at.  Nor did I find it funny.  All the sponsors on the jacket wrote about how funny it was, well, sorry, I vote that it wasn't.  This book was an easy read but left me bored.
0307592731|5.0|The author makes you feel as if you are right there on the trail with her. I could smell the fragrance of the pines and feel the mountain air. Kept me enthralled. Have read her book, Torch, but thought this book was better written. I don't usually read memoirs as the author can't resist too many excruciating tidbits that don't add anything to the story, but this author was restrained in that area.

0756405890|2.0|I never finished it. I got 500 pages in and just put it down and had no interest in continuing. There are some fun parts, but the irritating \\"story within a story\\" format damaged it badly. How can I feel suspense if I know the main character ends up in a bar telling this story. Bad decision on the author's part. Flashbacks are inherently boring. Anyway, it's not horrible, but the good parts have a lot of boring stuff between them.
B00006GFAB|4.0|If you are a lover of all rock music, but don't have a stack of KISS CDs, this is your best bet.  This CD will give you the songs you want, the songs you forgot about, and the BEST live version of Rock & Roll All Night that I have ever found.  In fact, I bought this CD over other compilations just to get that live track.  The rest of the CD gives a nice selection of KISS from the 70's era and the 80's.
0385311400|2.0|This book goes on and on and on, and never is there ever any serious conflict. Too much GD pillow talk, and too much needless description of leaves and plants and sunsets and god knows what else. Sooooo boring!!! Badly written romance at its least romantic.

0307888908|4.0|On page 85 of the book the authors say \\"The fastest way to change yourself is to hang out with people who are already the way you want to be.\\" I am unable to hang out with author Reid Hoffman, co-founded of LinkedIn, so I chose the next best choice ... read his new book.<br /><br />I did not learn any huge aha's from this book, but it did confirm some principles I either practice or have recently learned:<br />- Every entrepreneur or business owner must be able to finish this sentence well: A company or customer hires me over other professionals because __________________.<br /><br />- The best Plan B is rooted in Plan A but allows you the ability to shift direction. For example, Plan B could be starting a side business while still working on Plan A. I'm applying this principle in 2012 as I prepare for retirement in 2013.<br /><br />-Plan Z is your backstop if Plan A & B fail.<br /><br />- Lots on connections on LinkedIn are very important to serve as resources on Plan B & Z.<br /><br />- A trait of successful Broadway shows is the people behind the show is a combo of seasoned vets PLUS a smattering of new people that bring creativity and questions.<br /><br />Page 143 says success begins with an opportunity. An opportunity is like the snap to the quarterback in football. Without a snap, there is no chance for a touchdown.<br /><br />This book was a snap that I plan to use to score several touchdowns.

0307949486|3.0|This was quite an interesting book and wild read. I tried to read it a number of years ago and couldn't get into it. I'm not sure why I couldn't get into the book years ago, but I do know watching the movie prior to reading the book, this time, helped push me through the slow beginning. Once the basic mystery was laid before the reader it was hard to put the book down. At times the story was a bit graphic for me, but the graphic nature was essential to keep you hooked. I'm definitely interested in reading the rest of the series. I am sure the series will continue to be graphic and wild, but I am curious to see where Lisbeth's past and future will lead the reader.

B005LAII1C|2.0|Basically, it's Family Guy with new characters.<br /><br />If you enjoy family guy you won't necessarily love this one. To get laughs, many scenes include alcohol, drugs, and bongs, as if that instantly relates to any audience.  Well, to me, it's lame, and not funny when a movie relies a bong to carry it through.  Who cares if everyone is a pot head or crack addict.  After awhile it is lame, very lame.<br /><br />There were some funny moments; however, The plot was very bland and there was the typical moment where two of the characters break up and then get back together in the end through some nonsensical means.<br /><br />Worth a rental only in my opinion.

1449305172|5.0|My review in spanish: [...]<br /><br />Running Lean, has the tools needed to get the most of this era: \\"We are living in an age of entrepreneurship\\", with the constant reiteration that you had to test and systematically prove them. Everyone has ideas, but this book guide you to understand your startup.
0143039431|5.0|and I realized, even then, what a great book it was. And what a great talent as a writer Steinbeck was. His easy, fluid, yet intensely descriptive style is second to none. I have read books by him I appreciated more, and books I appreciated less, but I would say that this is his masterpiece. His high level of detail meshes perfectly with a gloomy, depressing slice of real American history. All of which he intensely researched. It's a well told story, and provided me with quite a bit of mental fodder to mull over. You don't have to bond with, or even like, the main characters, to enjoy the epic and panoramic nature. I am an artist and writer. I write my own novels now. Steinbeck still remains one of my biggest influences.<br />You don't have to agree with every position held by Steinbeck to enjoy his writing, and at no point in this does he push communism on the reader. You know what one of my favorite novels is? Atlas Shrugged. I vote libertarian. My favorite genres tend to be dark Sci-Fi and horror. That's what I write, and what magazines I do illustrations for. That is also entirely beside the point.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was a very good finale to the three book series.  I enjoyed the first two and this one did not disappoint.  The books need to be read in order.
B004LWZWBU|2.0|The Big Year is atrocious!  Luckily I can keep my thoughts short and sweet since nothing interesting happens so this won't take long.  The first 30 minutes is about Owen Wilson having marital troubles along with the reconstruction of his home.  The problem is that he's never home and is out bird watching instead, which results in constant arguments with his wife (she doesn't want him to go on his bird spotting adventure and given how boring and lifeless his character is, you can hardly blame her).  Jack Black likes to imitate the sounds of several birds and eventually wins the admiration of another bird caller (a female that he likes) on his particular bird spotting trip.  Steve Martin... well at first he cares about flat out boring business meetings, but eventually he tags along with Jack Black as they take to the snowy mountains of Alaska.<br /><br />When the actual bird spotting gets underway about halfway through, it becomes clear that Owen Wilson and Jack Black are competing against each other to see who can take the most photos of birds.  A disastrous decision on the part of the movie writers was to try and implement emotion like snapping bird photos is the most important competition ever.  Viewers won't buy into that sort of thing so adding feeling and concern for Jack and Owen's character was a horrible mistake.  Owen should have listened to his wife and just stayed home.  What a lousy movie, really.  Lousy writing, no humor whatsoever, no enticing storyline, flat film overall.<br /><br />That's right- no comedy at *all* despite being tagged as a comedy.  When you don't even laugh once you know something's wrong, SERIOUSLY wrong.<br /><br />The only worthwhile moment comes at the very end during the credits when we see all 755 photos of the collected birds running in succession.  Everything from cardinals to robins to ducks to mocking birds to... you name it.  It's an amazing sight and clearly the only reason to watch this movie.  I could watch those 3 minutes over and over.  For the amazing display of photos during the credits the Big Year gets a 2-star rating.<br /><br />The most disappointing part is that all those amazing bird varities were never even brought up during the duration of the movie.  What a shame.  Find a way to watch the credits and skip the rest.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|it is a fun game but not for kids blood sexual references and strong luangage but fun to steal cars and do all the fun missions
B0067QPVD2|5.0|The Thing turned out to be pretty darn awesome by my estimation.  Sure, maybe the original or the other remakes were better than this one but then again, I've either never seen the original (and other remakes) or I simply can't remember them.  They surely weren't as action-packed or suspenseful as this one.<br /><br />It's about a group of researchers who travel to Antarctica and dig up an alien stuck in the ice.  Well you can probably guess what happens next- the darn thing literally launches itself out of the ice and comes to life in grand, human-morphing fashion!  It's up to the research team (starring the extra cute Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and their trusty selection of flamethrowers to put out the threat, however there's a catch.<br /><br />These aliens can actually replicate human beings and specifically, members of the research team, which means the entire team is constantly under careful examination.  If something appears to be off just a *little* bit about their behavior -or the fact that aliens can't replicate the fillings in teeth- guess what happens to them?  As the old Mortal Kombat video game used to say, \\"Toasty!\\"  Time to take out the flamethrower and go to town!<br /><br />Entertainment starting about 20 minutes in and continuing until the very end- these aliens will pop up around the frozen facility during several surprising moments and wreak havoc on anyone that stands in their way.  I have to admit, the Exorcist-influenced \\"crawling backwards\\" motion of the aliens was really horrific and terrifying on a personal level.  Added to the fact is that the HEADS of the people the aliens were replicating were always attached to the front of the aliens body, and it's just really juicy and gross!  Remember the scene in the Exorcist when the little girl comes charging down the stairs backwards and her mom screams in disbelief?  Shades of that memorable scene reoccur here, and it's awesome.  I highly recommend this.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|A very entertaining and well-written book!<br />The story moved quickly enough to keep me riveted  to the storyline and included enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and wondering what was coming next!

0061245097|5.0|One Foot in the Grave picks up four years after the events of Halfway to the Grave. Cat Crawfield, half vampire,half human, has been working for an elite government unit, leading her own team and doing her part to eliminate as many rogue vampires as she can. She now has a reputation among the vampire world. She hasn't seen or had any contact with Bones, the vampire bounty hunter she worked with and fell in love with in the first book. And then unexpectedly she suddenly finds herself in the same room with him.<br /><br />I raved about the first book here, and I loved this one just as much. Cat, still sassy and sarcastic, has grown and matured, having settled into her new life and her job and being genuinely fond of her co-workers. Seeing Bones again brings up all sorts of emotions, feelings she never got over. But she isn't sure if he feels the same or if he hates her now, or maybe he moved on with his (undead) life and never even thought about her.<br /><br />Now her life has been targeted, and in between dealing with trying to stay alive and find out who has put out the hit on her, she also has to figure out just where she and Bones stand with each other. And since she needs his help, there is no avoiding the issue. Or eventually the sex, and there is one very hot session that takes Cat somewhere she thought she'd never go.<br /><br />As in the first book, the writing and dialogue is fresh and snappy and amusing. I don't have much else to say, except I loved this book and I can't wait to get the next one in the series.<br /><br />Oh wait, I do have one more thought: Bones. Ahh, Bones. * sigh * Bones is the hottest, sexiest...words fail me. I love him. I do.

0985114606|2.0|Cold shower is what you will need after reading this incredibly  intense story.<br /><br />The two characters  have traumatic pasts in common along with amazing mutual sexual attraction. Both parties fully aware of their issues, both hoping their past won't ruin their future together.<br /><br />The interaction between the pair is disturbing but yet a reality given both their backgrounds. The plus side is they are willing to work through their issues together with professional help as an alternative to just forging through with their difficult pasts.<br /><br />This is a warped love story with a touchy subject area that is presented in a non-fictional way. You can't tame your curiosity of what will transpire next for this spicy couple. You find yourself rooting for their success and hope their future sustains the stains of their pasts.<br /><br />An erotic story with an edge. I can't wait for the next book, I am hooked!

0307352145|5.0|I read this book in just a few days, it was really reassuring knowing that where I seem to go against the grain isn't anything to feel bad about. Cain does a great job illustrating how our society has formed around an extrovert idea, and how this isn't necessarily the way we should be headed: we definitely prefer blind action to thinking, I don't and felt I was weird because of this. I find myself lying like crazy in my job search saying that I'm a good multitasker, that I'm sociable, that I make quick decisions ... along with what's true - that I'm a good problem solver and a deep thinker. It seems like employers don't even know what they want these days and perceptions are so altered that what they get are liars and people with no sense of identity. This doesn't make the job search easier but it's made me more patient in just being myself and hoping that someone who's read this will take a look at my resume! ha

B000AARKOO|1.0|The First Crusade took place in 1095 AD. Christian Europe was invaded nearly four centuries earlier by Muslim armies. The majority of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) was conquered by Muslim armies in the early 8th century AD, where they remained for nearly 800 years. Christendom's first contact with Islam was at the end of a sword; the Crusades were a belated and muted European response to continued Islamic aggression against European and Middle Eastern Christians, and yet the West is always apologizing for its relations with the Islamic world. Why?<br /><br />Whether intentionally or accidentally, director Ridley Scott has used artistic license to a staggeringly anti-Catholic extreme in this film. Not a single aspect of Catholicism, whether Catholic clergy or rulers are treated sympathetically, indeed, many are outright distorted. The historical innacuracies of the film are too many to mention one by one, but with the help of About.com's guide to Medieval History, Melissa Snell, a professed &quot;agnostic&quot; who unambiguously declares &quot;when it comes to gods and religion, I question everything,&quot; I can highlight the most egregious ones.<br /><br />1. It was never, at any point in the history of the Catholic Church, customary to behead suicide victims post mortem (or at any other time) and bury them under giant crosses. They were buried in unconsecrated ground, that is, apart from other deceased Catholics, which all Christians were, at this date in history.<br /><br />2. Reynaud de Chatillon and Guy de Lusignan were actual historical figures, and Reynuad de Chatillon was a nasty character, though neither of them were Templar knights.<br /><br />3. Saladin was not nearly so tender and merciful as he was protrayed in the film. After the fall of Jerusalem to the Muslims, the Cross that sat atop the &quot;Temple of the Lord&quot; was dragged through the city and beaten with clubs for two days. Secondly, at end of the Battle of Hattin, the surviving Templar and Hospitaller knights who are captured by Saladin are beheaded, by his ordering.<br /><br />4. Saladin presumably sold many of his prisoners into slavery; they would have likely never returned to Europe.<br /><br />Melissa Snell, our professed agnostic About.com guide to medieval history, continues: &quot;But these (among others) are just minor film flubs that you're likely to find in any historical epic. The biggest, most jarring inconsistency between fact and film lies in Scott's imposition of modern viewpoints on medieval individuals.<br /><br />Scott may not have intended it, but there is a pervasive anti-Catholic viewpoint running through the entire film. From the priest who stole a cross from a corpse he was burying, to the angelic monk shouting &quot;To murder an infidel is not a sin -- it is the will of God!&quot; to the sniveling bishop ready to surrender with &quot;Convert to Islam now; repent later,&quot; not a single official of the Catholic Church was portrayed with any sympathy. I will freely admit that there were indeed bad priests, lunatic monks and self-serving bishops associated with the Crusades. But there were also priests of conscience, peace-loving monks and competent bishops. You'd never know it from Kingdom of Heaven.&quot;<br /><br />You can basically rest assured that anytime a Hollywood director sets his eyes on the Crusades, the story will be told from an anachronistic, anti-Catholic and anti-Western perspective. It feeds a popularly held sentiment that the West, even those of us living now, must somehow atone for supposed acts of Western imperialism from antiquity. What's never talked about is that Christian kingdoms in Europe, including most of Spain, and large chunks of Italy, an area several times larger than the entire Holy Land, were invaded and conquered by Muslim armies nearly 400 years before the first Crusade in 1095 AD.<br /><br />I had a similar conversation with another Amazon.com patron, and it's worth quoting:<br/><br />Amazon customer: &quot;The Muslims were in the Middle East, where they belonged. They were defending their homeland.&quot;<br /><br />My response: It, being the Middle East, only became their homeland after the original inhabitants of that homeland (numbering several hundred thousand at the time) were conquered, executed, raped, enslaved, and/or forcibly converted to Islam. What part of the Muslim CONQUEST of the peaceful Christians of the Middle East do you not understand?<br /><br />Secondly, unprovoked Islamic aggression against Christendom predates the Crusades. If you require further proof, see below.<br /><br />What would you call those little military excursions into the historically Christian, and ethnically non-Arab hinterlands of North Africa? What would you call the Muslim conquest of Christian Spain in 711 AD (or al-Andalus, as the Muslims called it)? Cookies and tea? Or how about the Muslim conquest of chunks of Italy (Palermo in 831 AD, Messina in 842 AD, Enna in 859 AD, Syracuse in 878 AD, and Catania in 900 AD) and France? Sunday outings? What about the conquest of Byzantine Anatolia by Muslim Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 AD? Does the name Charles Martel, or the Battle of Tours (732 AD), in 8th century France, ring any bells? My history is a little hazy, but, to my recollection, historians regard it as the battle that saved Christendom from permanent Muslim conquest.<br /><br />ALL of the aforementioned Islamic conquests of Christian lands predate the first Crusade in 1095 AD.<br /><br />Although I make a persuasive argument using my knowledge of history alongside your standard of criticism, I don't accept your anachronistic form of argumentation. I don't believe the Crusades really speak at all to the goodness or evil of Catholicism.<br /><br />Accordingly, I don't believe that modern day Muslims should be permanently branded by the acts of their forebears (such as the murder and subjugation of the Middle East's majority Christian population), but if you want to argue based on historical atrocities whose group has behaved more imperialistically throughout history, you WILL lose; I am more than equipped to refute your assertions based on your own form of argumentation, though I would prefer not to stigmatize Muslims or Catholics based on events in antiquity, and neither should you. So why don't you put the Crusades to rest, already?<br /><br />In closing, I'll repeat my previous admonition: know your facts.&quot;/><br />Amazon customer: &quot;The Muslims were in the Middle East, where they belonged.

0143119680|4.0|In A Discovery of Witches, much like the blurb states, I was reminded of my days of reading Anne Rice.  I remembered when the idea of vampires chilled me to the bone, made me feel a little bit like I needed to watch over my shoulder, and provided me with a touch of forbidden romance.  Then came the young adult vampire craze.  Girls went gaga over the idea of an Edward, screaming loudly for a man to come and dominate their lives and their sexuality much like Edward did Bella's, and my fascination with vampires spiraled down into a fierce explosion of hate.<br /><br />But A Discovery of Witches managed to rekindle a little bit of that old love that remained.  This book provided me with a little bit of that forbidden thrill, and honestly I was a bit ashamed of myself for liking it as much as I did.  I appreciated Diana's boldness and desire to protect herself as much as I resented Michael's desire to protect her and cut her off from the world.<br /><br />I think that the warring emotions I had while reading A Discovery of Witches speaks mostly as a testament to my own growth.  I was a teenager when I discovered Anne Rice and I wanted nothing more than to find a strong man and be protected.  Now, as a self-serving adult woman, that same idea is a bit more distasteful to me. But still.. there's that little bit of longing and so I enjoy myself in fiction and laugh about that enjoyment when I put the book down.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches is not a fast, quick read - but it reads quickly.  It absorbed me completely and I loved nearly every moment of it (the mooning and constant professions of love that overtook the book about halfway through I could have done without).  I'm happy I picked this up when the publisher was promoting it, and I'm even more thrilled to have in my possession a copy of the next book in the series because, frankly, I'm not ready to leave Diana and Michael behind for a while yet.
0345803485|4.0|I actually read most of this book in flight to Kauai. For a nervous flyer it certainly took my mind off flying! I have to agree with others about the same phrases being used multiple times. Every time that happened (quite often actually) it did bug me a little. However, it did not bug me enough to stop reading the book. It is so different from the life I lead that is was a bit fun to absorb myself in the characters. To try and understand why Christian was as successful, yet so messed up all at once. I was trying to read between the lines and get a feel for if Christian really wanted just a \\"sub\\" or was he really in love with Ana? I chose to believe he was falling for her in more than just the way he desired in the book. It isn't really a sure thing though, it keeps you guessing. I am not happy with the way the book ended, and now I will need to read book two in hopes that one will end better. It isn't outstanding literature or anything, but for a big entertaining distraction it will do just fine!
B0083GPDBO|5.0|Chronicle is the latest in the series of movies using the well-worn storytelling techniques first seen in the Blair Witch Project: it is the smartest use for them yet.<br /><br />The story of three adolescent boys who stumble upon something that gifts each of them vast telekinetic powers, Chronicle follows them as each of them learns to cope with suddenly being able to do practically anything by force of will alone.<br /><br />On one level, it is a character study filled with themes that everyone who has ever read a comic book will instantly understand and recognize. On another level, it's a surprisingly good action film--one that doesn't leave you groaning when the action unfolds and things break down.<br /><br />This is due in large part to a surprisingly well-written script that includes all the expected telekinesis cliches (\\"Did you do that?\\" Look! I can move it, I can move it!\\") and adds things to the managerie, as their growing power reveals a growing darkness in one of the characters, leading to a finale that by itself is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Using an unsteady camcorder and footage from other cameras as its point of view, Chronicle shares a storytelling method with Cloverfield, the Earlier Blair Witch Project and the ultra-low-budget Paranormal Activity, but Chronicle, with its smarter, tighter writing and direction has more ideas and better executed ideas than you see in its \\"found-footage\\" predecessors and is simply a smarter and more emotionally satisfying movie.<br /><br />Watching it will make you believe that the \\"found-footage\\" movie has finally grown up.

B00007K02F|5.0|In this 1996 version; Jane is not charming because at a young age her hateful aunt slandered her, and sent her to an orphanage, where she was raised by a headmaster who also slandered her and was mean to her.<br /><br />Jane grows up and becomes a governess; a live-in tutor for a little girl. Jane is not glamorous. However, the girl's widower, father notices Jane's goodness.<br /><br />The film holds your attention. Filmed on location. Nice sets and costumes. The relationships are believable. This version moves at a better pace than other versions.<br /><br />The 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson is a good version too. Its slow pace is redeemed by some excellent scenes. In the 2007 version; Jane has some charm and personality. Both Jane and Rochester are likeable. Women viewers will love the romance of the Masterpiece Theatre version.<br /><br />The 1944 black & white version begins promising during Jane's childhood, because the headmaster is a true villain and Jane wins our sympathy. However, Jane's childhood is a brief part of the film. The main story of Jane's adult life centers on her relationship with Rochester. Orson Welles' Rochester is so harsh and unlikeable without any redeeming qualities that it is not believable Jane would like him. Rochester's house may be historically accurate, but it is so dark and dreary, with no daytime scenes of light to give any hope, that viewers are overwhelmed with depression.<br /><br />The 1-star reviews of this 1996 version are all by people who have read the book. If you have not read the book; you will like this. Two people can read the same book and imagine very different characters. A reader with a vivid imagination will always imagine something better than any movie can reproduce. What this movie does; it does well. There is more of the story to be told in future versions. The 1996 version is a heartwarming film. It is a story about a plain girl who develops qualities a man can love.
160309007X|3.0|This volume was going to be great. It would wash away the disappointment from The Black Dossier and the less than spectacular 1910 and 1969. My all time favorite writer would come through in the end and deliver a barn burner. I so wanted to love this one but it soon became clear that this was shaping up to be more like The Black Dossier than Volume 1 (which was BRILLIANT). Still, if there's one thing Alan Moore knows how to do it's write an ending and I held out hope right up until the end before finally resigning myself to the fact that 2009 was the weakest of the three Century books. None of which were that spectacular<br /><br />It's 2009, 40 years since Mina parted ways with Allan and Orlando. Orlando is fully woman when she receives a message from Prospero at the Blazing World warning that the antichrist child (from previous chapters) is nearly ready to act and the end of the world is nigh. In a panic she decides it's time to put the trio back together again to prevent Armageddon. Unfortunately the past 40 years have not been well to Mina and Allen and they may be in no condition to fight the demonic spawn.<br /><br />One issue I had with 1969 was how Mina and Allen basically bore no resemblance anymore to their famous characters. Little has changed in 2009 and I just don't get a feeling like I'm reading a story featuring literary characters. I also get no vibe that Orlando is actually 3000 years old other than the frequent mentions that she/he is 3000 years old. The finale was well below what I normally expect from Alan Moore. It pains me to write this review because I've received so much enjoyment for well over two decades from Moore's writing but I'd be lying as a reviewer if I said this was anything more than a huge disappointment. There are all sorts of crowd faces looking at the reader that I assume are famous people but I don't recognize them. Things are happening in the backgrounds that I assume relate to something in literature but I don't know what they're supposed to mean but the real problem is the main storyline that just plods along and the Deus Ex Machina ending.<br /><br />Apparently this is NOT the final installment of the League with the planned<br />\\"Tales of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" upcoming but I pray it's a vast improvement over this. Nothing can ever take away from Alan Moore's legacy but if you're reading through his entire library of works this is one I would put very low on the reading list.ey're supposed to mean but the real problem is the main storyline that just plods along and the Deus Ex Machina ending.<br /><br />Apparently this is NOT the final installment of the League with the planned<br />\\"Tales of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" upcoming but I pray it's a vast improvement over this.

Give me a good old Made in USA CD any time.<br /><br />The reason why I buy from Amazon and ship it all the way to Asia is for the Made in USA tag. The Made in Mexico sound quality sux, it sounds like someone recorded it with a pillow over the microphone. I might as well buy a Made in China that's 1/10th the price.<br /><br />Packing was terrible too, looks like someone just dumped all the CDs into the box and shipped it.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|I read the book because a few friends said that the book was better than the movie. So being the curious George that i am when it comes to literature, i decided to read this book from amazon prime membership. The book started off slow. I did not like that. It did not quickly grab my attention like many others in my library. But once you get to the arena, it starts to take off. the conflict between competitors and trainers was the best part, and the fights within the storyline was good too. But the problem with this book is one... it starts off with old English settings making you think it was during the, what i call Camelot times. and later, you find out that it more within futuristic times. You cannot have both together. And the twists on how the last competitor gets killed, was stupid in itself. And the stupidest part was the love conflict. I mean, that was like Suzanne Collins took the definition of stupid and turn it into stupid love. I'm glad that i got it for free because if i would've paid for it, i would've gotten a refund. I will not be continuing to read the rest of the trilogy.
B006LSZECO|1.0|For the first time I went to the end.....I could not stand anymore.  This is \\"trash writing\\"!!  I got to page 257 trying so hard to like this book....unnecessary vulgarity....poor substance...and the ending is even dumber!  The other reviews are spplauding the book....so I won't give it away, everybody has a right to their opinions.  If people are really like this.....heaven help them....I don't want to read about it. I wish I could get my money back!
B004SIP98S|5.0|My housekeeper asked me to buy the DVD as she knows I buy a lot of items from Amazon.  Upon arrival I wanted to watch the \\"Queen\\" also.  Frankly, I have never followed the tabloid trash regarding the \\"royals\\" and the only reason I bothered viewing the Queen was because of Ms. Mirren's reputation as a superb actress.  I cannot speak honestly to the historical accuracy that was presented.  However, Ms. Mirren took this role and the quality of her acting as well as the other characters in the story make this film most entertaining.  Interestingly, not one word of profanity was used in the dialog and a 5 star movie was produced.  Maybe other film makers could profit from my own observation.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Shallow as in lacking depth is the only word which I associate with this book. I am not sure how it made the best sellers list, but I got fooled all right to purchase it. It has a very weak plot, it is far-fetched and unrealistic. It reminded me of Twilight in some ways, though I enjoyed reading that book. At least Twilight had some interesting events and characters. I would not recommend this book. Save your money and time for a better read.

0374275637|5.0|I've been trading in the market for years now and I've realized from personal experience that it is nearly impossible to consistently beat the market. This book provides several pieces of evidence furthering that point and disproving the so called \\"stock picking\\" skill. For readers who would like to know more about this topic, I would definitely recommend John Bogle's book: Common Sense Investing. It is focused entirely on these fallacies and illusions. Now, I've improved my results by using a hybrid portfolio method that tracks indexes and several stocks. There are several trading websites that are incorporating this research into portfolio design. Definitely check out sites like treetopstrading.com if you're interested in the application of these TFAS investing concepts.

0439023491|2.0|I'm not going to mince words on this one, I often wanted *the book* to catch fire.  I know that for some people it was their favourite, but if you don't enjoy reading about teen girls being confused and angst ridden about their romantic prospects it will only bore you.<br /><br />That's not to say there wasn't anything else in the books, there was.  There were several ideas that could have been further fleshed out to give the book at least as much depth as The Hunger Games, if not more.  Unfortunately, Collins chose instead to focus on Katniss' (non-existent) love life.  Once again there were pacing issues with the suggestion of a rising rebellion we never actually see taking a back seat to the Peeta-Katniss-Gale love triangle.  Katniss sees the signs of it, but rather than show us those signs Collins took the route of having Katniss tell us in a short paragraph.<br /><br />What's more, the love triangle isn't even all that interesting.  Peeta is a near-perfect (if bumbling) gentleman while Gale is given the role of soon-to-be violent revolutionary.  It's clear from the outset who Katniss will end up with so that if you agree you don't have to worry and if you disagree you spend the entire time asking why.  The only upside is that the second half of the book at least gives Katniss (and the readers) a distraction while also introducing a lively cast of new characters.  It's still far too rushed for my tastes, but it prevented Catching Fire from being a complete waste of time and paper.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As usual, the book is much better.  I had never heard of George R.R. Martin before seeing the series on television.  If you enjoy fantasy, you'll love this one.
0439023521|3.0|I made the mistake of reading the entire Hunger Games trilogy in one sitting without stopping to take notes on what I wanted to post about each one so I had to read them again to make sure they weren't all muddled in my mind.  Suggestion: don't do that.  The books are much better when you take the time in between to let what you've read settle into your thoughts.<br /><br />As everyone probably knows by now, The Hunger Games is about a teenage girl in a dystopian world where every year 24 children are sent to an arena where they will each try to be the last one alive.  The girl, Katniss, volunteers to take part in the Games in order to save her younger sister.  It's an interesting plot idea on its own and Collins manages to make it even moreso without falling into the usual traps of teen angst and guilt.  It is violent and somewhat gruesome, but not to the point of excess.  Readers with wilderness knowledge may question a few moments, but the emotional realism makes up for the more contrived points.<br /><br />The one major complaint I do have is that the pacing is a bit off.  The time before Katniss' arrives in the Arena drags while what should be the actual substance of the books (The Games) is painted with very broad strokes.  That said, The Hunger Games is still my favourite of the trilogy.  In fact, I suggest skipping the other two as they fall far short of the mark.<br /><br />I know that one of the bigger questions about the book is whether or not it's appropriate for younger teens and children.  I honestly don't know.  I don't have children so I'm not versed in what's considered age-appropriate these days.  I will say that The Hunger Games has a wide variety of themes to explore that I would have found interesting at about 11-13 (and still do).  There's everything from the morality of killing another person to save yourself to sacrificing yourself for a loved one to more simple questions of friendship and trust.  What I can't remember is whether or not the more violent sections would have given me nightmares.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This film has it all- a great story with compelling characters, drama, romance, action, and fabulous costumes! You will not be disappointed. I got to see an advance screening and STILL paid to see it in theaters again because it was wonderful. My husband bought the blu ray when it first came out.
0439023513|1.0|That it's taken me over three months to calm down from my intense anger enough to actually write this review is indicative of just how horribly awry Collins went when she wrote Mockingjay.  If you are looking for an action filled story of the leader of a rebellion and the oppressed masses rising up to declare their freedom you'll have to look elsewhere.  This is not the dystopian adventure Collins promised with The Hunger Games, it is a thinly veiled teenage romance with a side of quasi-adventure slipped in.<br /><br />There are elements of the book that I did like, particularly the fact that Collins at least allows Katniss to be aware of her figurehead status rather than pretending she is actually in charge as in many other YA novels.  Peeta's character shift was a welcome reprieve from the saintly figure he was in the previous two books.  Finnick's story is both adorable and heartbreaking.  The juxtaposition of President Snow and President Coin had possibilities rarely seen in YA fiction.<br /><br />Unfortunately, such elements were neglected in favour of Katniss' ongoing struggle to decide between Peeta and Gale.  Why she simply could not have been single and in therapy is beyond me.  Apparently every female main character in fiction must be paired off in the end.  In fact, Katniss' choice is so important that Collins drives both boys' characters to even further extremes, something that has the frustrating side effect of removing what few moral grey areas existed and forcing readers to believe that there is only one true path and everything else is evil.<br /><br />To make matters even worse, Collins decided to go the way of Rowling and add a painfully trite epilogue to an already problematic series.  A warning to parents: if you do not want your daughters to believe that marriage and children solve all of your problems you will want to look elsewhere for their reading material.  Katniss not only allows herself to be coerced into having children, her mental stateis greatly hurt during her first pregnancy and she is still coerced into doing it again in order to give her the requisite son and daughter of clichéd fairytale endings.  This may be a message Collins finds appropriate to send to teens, but it's the opposite of what I'd want my own children to learn.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|A great movie it is just sad that the creators weren't smart enough to create a more compelling name that would have created interest in a movie that represents a story written by one of the best of our time.  Take the time to appreciate an instant classic.

B007Z9RAX4|3.0|Mallory Kane is employed by a freelance agency to recover hostages and perform other contract work for governments that don't want to dirty their hands with that sort of thing.  After an assignment in Barcelona, Mallory goes to Dublin, supposedly on a cakewalk assignment, only to find that she's been betrayed.  Trying to piece together the nature of and motivation for the betrayal is probably more challenging for the viewer than for Mallory.  Fortunately for the viewer, Mallory makes the improbable decision to tell her story to a random stranger whose car she steals while making one of her getaways from the people who are trying to kill her.<br /><br />Apart from being hard to follow, the direction of Haywire is a little too gimmicky.  Choppy editing is intended to convey a sense of edginess.  Action scenes frequently shift between sepia-tinted frames, black-and-white frames, washed-out frames, and normal-colored frames.  I suppose it's interesting to watch but it's all been done before.  Steven Soderbergh has done it all before, and he's clearly capable of better things.<br /><br />If you like chases, shootouts, and fistfights -- and who doesn't? -- Haywire has plenty to offer.  There are some wicked fight scenes that are enough to make the movie worth watching.  Too often, however, prolonged scenes of Mallory running (or even walking) become a substitute for plot development.  You could watch this movie with the sound off and probably enjoy it more -- at the very least, you could enjoy the action while avoiding the confusion.
034580404X|5.0|OMG! I have to say it was the best thing I have ever read and when they write the next book I will be reading that also. I would read it again too. Reading it seemed so real and that you were actually in it doing the things Christian and Ana were doing from making love to the car chase, it was tender and loving to heart pumping and makes one want more.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Ridley Scott directed Prometheus so you know it's going to look good. I admired the way the movie is constructed and enjoyed looking at the sets and props. The cast is good and they turn in sound performances.  Devotees will appreciate the movie for whatever value it adds to the [[ASIN:B00498VS1E Alien]] lineage of movies.  As a fun, good-looking movie, Prometheus is a limited success.<br /><br />Unfortunately Prometheus lacks the depth of Ridley Scott's best work. The characters talk about answering the most meaningful questions that mankind can pose but when it comes right down to it, Prometheus is another \\"there's an alien in my body\\" movie combined with an \\"aliens want to destroy the Earth\\" movie. Did we really need another one?  To be fair, there are some clever touches, some interesting twists, and a thoughtful ending, making this an above-average evil alien movie, but it's still just an evil alien movie.  Watching Prometheus is a pleasant way to kill a couple of hours, but the movie is far from exceptional.

0375703764|5.0|While the book is long and sometimes hard to follow (it jumps back and forth between at least 3 narratives), it is hard to put down! There are some parts that are kind of slow and read like an essay (one narrative is actually an essay over a documentary), but are still terribly interesting. The amount of knowledge and references required for this book astounds me. As long as you like psychological stories and horror, I would recommend this to anyone I meet!<br />Warning: One narrative that is quite strong throughout the book relies quite heavily on crude language and R-rated scenes, so if you are easily offended you may want to skip this book.

B003Y5H5B0|5.0|1.  I rarely rarely give any comedy 5 stars, but this is truely deserving of that ranking.  Of the various film genres, comedy has got to be one of the most subjective in terms of who likes what etc...  With that being said, this flim was very well written, well acted, had a straight forward story line and was simply funny without relying on \\"stupid humor\\" (my term).  Obviously, it's difficult to explain why something is funny and thus in the end, one will have to check it out, but definitely for me a truly excellent film.
0761169253|5.0|This book is so cool! It's very simply written, no complicated BS. It's a quick read, and it left me feeling inspired and more motivated to persue my projects that I had been neglecting.<br /><br />Thank you!
B005LAIGYQ|2.0|1.  It's amazing how people just let their emotions guide their movie reviews.  I understand that folks like a nice patriotic movie (or at least most folks); I'm in that crowd.  On the other hand, let's deal with reality here and specifically review the actual movie and not the content of the movie.<br /><br />2.  Bottomline, this film's main downfall is the lame - stiff - unnatural acting.  The cinematography is good, the writing is fairly good, the storyline is good enough for me (I'm a fairly easy guy to please), but the acting is just terrible.  I mean, as you're watching this film, you're just completely conscious that these guys are trying to act natural, but that they're just not pulling it off.  With the above being said, with anyone with a military interest or background, it's a no brainer to watch the film just to see what the hype is about,  but a one time view is going to suffice for most.

0345803485|1.0|Like many others, I'd heard enough about this book to want to give it a go. It is truly awful. I read the first couple of chapters and then had to skip ahead because I couldn't stand it and I wanted to at least read one sex scene before closing and deleting the file. The leading lady (Ana) expresses surprise, fear, puzzlement, and worry, almost the only emotions she seems capable of, with this collection of erudition: 'holy crap', 'crap', 'holy cow' and other slightly more colourful versions of these. She expresses sexual pleasure with this pearler: 'Oh my'. She refers to her vagina as 'down there' (with the 'there' italicised for extra naughtiness). The (British) author has her (American) lead man, the Christian Grey of the title, say something along the lines of 'I believe that if one is to make one's fortune, one has to do it oneself'. The Queen would be proud. Ana always says that Christian 'cocks his head to one side'. I've read maybe 75 pages of the book and he's done it about 10 times. He's done it so often I myself have fallen over. You can almost feel the author rubbing her hands together in glee: 'COCKED his head to one side! What a clever double entendre!' Quite apart from the imbalance, surely a dominant wouldn't have this particular tic? It's such an empathetic body signal, not one of control. And then there are clanger dangling modifiers. 'Thanking her, I walked into the elevator'. Poor receptionist. Did she hear the thanks Ana gave her so dismissively? 'Returning to the bedroom, Christian is still asleep.' Oh, a sleepwalker. No, just EL James not knowing how to modify a noun. 'Collapsing on top of me, I feel his full weight crushing me into the mattress.' God. Truly awful. The sex isn't sexy - rather, this is how he takes her virginity: 'he slams into me' and 'rips through my virginity'. I'd love to be able to review this book fully, for its character development, for its subtle exploration of hitherto forbidden subjects, for its commentary on sexualpolitics. I'd even like to be able to say it was trash literature but great porn. But it's not. Find something better to do with your time - you won't regret that you didn't ever finish this one.

This book WILL give you the tools to understand which foods cause the most problems and why they cause problems.

Ana and Christrian were two different people from different worlds when Ana stumble into GEH offices. This was about love at first sight and how a frail little boy in a mans body transforms. It had so much details and cliffs hanger that you could not put it down. It is a love story with so much mayhem and love. If you are into the white/black knight this is the book for you.

B000F3T3E6|5.0|\\"Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno\\"  is an early work of Handel, composed in 1707 and already displaying his very distinct style that is audible with his cantatas, some of which are written by the libretto and for the same Cardinal Benedetto Pamphili [[ASIN:B000HT34UW Le Cantate per il Cardinal Pamphili (Le cantate italiane di Handel, 1)]], just as this masterwork.  The accompanied booklet of this recording mentions that this is the first work of Handel where he displayed significant borrowing from other composers, referring specifically to pieces from operas of Reinhard Keiser, Handel's musical director and teacher during his time in Hamburg.<br /><br />But even without knowing of Keiser, what strikes a listener in the music of \\"Il Trionfo\\" is the unmistakable influence of a more popular Vivaldi; this is especially evident in certain places such as in Bellezza's aria \\"Un pensiero nemico di pace\\" (CD1, track 14).  I am quite sure that if this aria was played to an unsuspecting audience, most would attribute it to the author of the ubiquitous \\"Quattro Stagione\\" - indeed his signature is as eminent there as in any of his 400+ operas (a record Handel did not beat).  Another aria drawn from Vivaldi is \\"Piu non cura\\" - Disinganno sings this (CD2, track 10).  But what differs Handel from Vivaldi is a greater range of genius or expression;  the variety of moods, nuances and  tempi is what makes Handel's music superior to Vivaldi's, although this variety can be attributed again to the extensive borrowing.  Perhaps Vivaldi would have been as cherished as Handel in his time and as respected today if he had done some Handel-style re-use of other composers' ideas, but alas... obviously il Prete Rosso was not such a talented and sophisticated courtier as Il Caro Sassone.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this oratorio shows various styles in composition;  going back to Reinhard Keiser, I was surprised to learn from the booklet that such a quintessentially Handel's music as the Disinganno's aria \\"Crede l'uom ch'egli riposi\\" (CD 1, track 23) owes completely to Keiser's  \\"Ruhig sein\\" from his opera \\"Octavia\\" (1705).  I have heard this theme in many of his operas/oratorios, for example,  in \\"Jerusalem, thou shalt no more\\" from Athalia (an oratorio written 30 years after Il Trionfo)  and always admired Handel's genius for this elevating, shining music; yet it is Keiser's!  I think he was able to get away with all this because Rome, where this work was composed, was too far from Hamburg at his time, although in Florence his \\"borrowing\\" was already well-known and much discussed in Ferdinando de Medici circles, which included composers Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti, Giacomo Antonio Perti, Giovanni Legrenzi, Benedetto Marcello and others.<br /><br />All  in all, Handel had perused material from  seven (!!!) Keiser's operas in his triumphal Trionfo.  We can only regret that not much Keiser's works are available today, while they probably deserve much attention since Handel found them so worthy.<br /><br />Obviously the composer returned to Il Trionfo's score many times - his all-time hit \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" from Rinaldo is found here in Il Trionfo as Piacere's aria \\"Lascia la spina\\", and the final aria of Bellezza \\"Tu del Ciel ministro eletto\\" have transferred practically without any change to  Angelica's aria \\"Ritornava al suo bel viso\\" from \\"Orlando\\".  In the comments section of this review I provide a link to this splendid aria.<br /><br />Finally, there is also the French style that is presented in pieces like Piacere's aria \\" Chiudi, chiudi I vaghi rai\\" (CD2, track 2) - it must be this distinct style that made Arcangelo Corelli, a virtuoso violinist playing Il Trionfo in concerts, refer to Il Trionfo's overture as written in the French style (Handel had rewritten the overture and we hear today the \\"Italian\\" style of it).<br /><br />Another thing that distinguishes the work is the amazingly high quality of intelligence in the libretto.  These are all good old friends the Arcadians who devoted their lives to enlightenment (coincidentally, Disinganno!) and refinement, they sought Bellezza and Piacere in discoursing sublime philosophical ideas on Aristotelean level, one could say, and they truly reveled in their exclusivity of thought.<br /><br />A mere 100 years later sugary-soupy dramas of Rossini/Bellini/Donizetti would dominate the scene, but again the works of those composers were written to please the growing number of wealthy bourgeoisie, while Handel composed for the elite and already shrinking circle of the most refined aristocracy.  We are fortunate to sample pieces from the Arcadians' feast, as truly this music is probably the pinnacle of its art, with the decline starting from Beethoven and even Mozart not far.<br /><br />I love that this work, as many others that Handel wrote, is so removed from reality and talks about all things unmaterial and celestial; truly it is difficult not to envisage a Tiziano's picture \\"Profane and Celestial Love\\", which is in Villa Borghese; while Benedetto Pamphili lived not that far away in a much more opulent  palace known today as Palazzo Doria-Pamphili, still privately owned (!!!) and housing incomparable works of art, like Caravaggio's \\"Caravaggio Flight to Egypt\\" or Velasquez \\"Portrait of Pope Innocent X\\", among other outstanding works by Brueghel, Durer, Guido Reni, Claude Lorrain, etc., not to mention the amazing galleries and the overall architecture...no wonder that he considered himself expert enough in beauty and pleasure to write about their dangerous effects on reason, a.k.a enlightenment, and was rich enough to employ composers who immortalized Pamphili's name through the beauty and pleasure of their works.<br /><br />Musically, the rendition is superb.  Natalie Dessay as Bellezza is marvelous, with her somewhat childish, chirping tone, suggesting utmost  youth accompanied by  joy and self-possessed pleasure, so marvelously sung by a lower tessitura of a mezzo Ann Hallenberg.  On the second thought, a more clear and instrumental voice like Sandrine Piau could be more suited for the purity of Baroque style...  The wise disillusioned Disinganno is superbly cast by an alto Sonia Prina, and Tempo by a thrilling voice of Pavol Breslik.  I think these are some of the best voices available today to create a magnificent Il Trionfo that truly triumphs under the baton of Emmanuelle Haim.  I was not much enamored by her for her work with Natalie Dessay on Cleopatra's album [[ASIN:B004J48G6I Handel : Cleopatra - Giulio Cesare Opera Arias]], but here Mme. Haim created a true gem of Baroque music.<br /><br />Once more I'd like to stress that the most effect is achieved when the text is read or understood, because although so very serious, it is also secretly mischievous, and some images it creates for the great effect, like \\"the funeral urns full of many beauty's skeletons\\", are quite funny, reminding of a once fashionable British funeral humor.  I can imagine the Arcadians, leisuring out in the most glorious garden of the Queen Christina's splendid residence Palazzo Corsini, in the most magnificent city of all, under the balmy Roman sun, basking in indescribable luxury, pleasantly discussing grave subjects as cold bones devoured by Time, brevity of life and imminent departure from its pleasures that fatum so generously poured on them, chosen lucky ones.  Well, we can take pleasure in some of the beauty they have left to us till today, as this music.<br /><br />Highly recommended.re all good old friends the Arcadians who devoted their lives to enlightenment (coincidentally, Disinganno!) and refinement, they sought Bellezza and Piacere in discoursing sublime philosophical ideas on Aristotelean level, one could say, and they truly reveled in their exclusivity of thought.<br /><br />A mere 100 years later sugary-soupy dramas of Rossini/Bellini/Donizetti would dominate the scene, but again the works of those composers were written to please the growing number of wealthy bourgeoisie, while Handel composed for the elite and already shrinking circle of the most refined aristocracy.

I would love to see this made into a movie, with the hopes that it wouldnt get screwed up like most movies based on books. Im looking forward to more works from this author, She writes amazing and beautiful, making you fall in love with her charaters. A must read crazy love story.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was quickly engrossed in reading this book and enjoyed the writing.  The last 1/3 of the book became tedious and a bit ridiculous but I continued reading hoping I could figure out THE clue that would tell me how the cops get their culprit.  And the ending is so disappointing.  I was angry about investing the time to read this book, getting so anxious to find out how everything would be solved, only to be left with an awful ending that did NOT tie everything together.  If you like good mysteries that bring together all the clues to resolution or enjoy a shocking (but satisfying) twist - this is not a book you will enjoy.

1594202842|3.0|As I read this book I was reminded of my own mother's cruelty. The shaming, criticizing and belittling in order to control was familiar. Amy and her lot are not the only mothers who abused their children under the guise of doing it for their own good. I saw this occur in my \\"western\\" family and in other \\"western\\" families around me growing up. The mothers' need for perfectionism in their children was paramount so the mothers would look superior to others, and so cruel and unattainable for their children. These parents subject their children to this sickness in secret, behind the facade of warm smiles to the public. It is my hope that Sophia and Lulu will not pass this trauma on to their own children.<br />My mother, who was of German descent, was no different in her parenting style than Amy - both are arrogant, narcissistic women who try to use their children to feed their addiction to adoration.  What these women do not realize is that by demanding complete control over their children, they are setting them up for becoming victims of sexual abuse by the likes of people such as Sandusky, the priests, and other authority figures.<br />It is a sad commentary of our world when parents, regardless of nationality, feel excellence can only be achieved by destroying the child's spirit.

1409116328|5.0|It's so difficult for me to write a review of a book that I LOVE. It's like, I want to do justice to the book with my review, but feel that I won't be able to, so I put off writing the review. As I write this review of Rainbow Rowell's sophomore effort (her first being the superb \\"Attachments\\"), you can bank on the fact that I've gone back and reread, rewritten and reworded this, but I still won't feel I've done Rainbow's book justice. But, here goes:<br /><br />\\"Eleanor & Park\\" tells the story of a school year (1986-87) in the life of the titular characters. The reader gets a bird's-eye view (or should I say bus-eye view) of their first encounter, their getting to know one another to their falling in love. But let me tell you right now: it's not a teen-angsty, cutesy book. Rainbow delves DEEP into the characters of both Eleanor and Park, so much so that they practically jump out of the page and sit next to you to read the book along with you (like E&P's bus ride to school sharing a Watchmen comic).<br /><br />(*Side note: While there is much talk of comic books and comic-book characters, if you are not a fan of those, please don't let that put you off reading this. I can honestly say I've never read a comic book in my life, except maybe Calvin & Hobbes, and I found this comic element only adds to the story w/o putting off noncomic-book readers. Rainbow uses comic books as a plot advancer, metaphor, comedic element, etc., but it never overpowers or becomes overladen in \\"geekiness.\\" Trust me, it's cool.)<br /><br />Rainbow perfectly captures the tentative awkwardness that one feels as a teenager who is isn't quite used to her body, her hormones and the opposite sex. The electricity of that first touch from someone you have feelings for -- hoping upon hope that he feels the same way too -- to one's insecurity with one's body, to the topsy-turvy butterfly stomach of your first kiss, Rainbow expertly plumbs those adolescent depths.<br /><br />Of course, it's not all unicorns and butterflies in E&P's world -- Eleanor has to deal with some major issues in her home life, as well as being the target of bullies at school. And Park's issues stem from not feeling fully accepted by his macho father, nor his town in general, as (in his mind) he's the only half-American/half-Korean teenage boy in the tristate area who doesn't fit the All-American Boy standard.<br /><br />I also have to mention E&P's (and Rainbow's) great taste in music. This book's soundtrack will have you rushing to your iTunes account to buy some of these songs that you only had on cassette or vinyl and really want to hear again.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I don't want to give away too much. Just know that as you read this book: you will laugh out loud; you will knowingly smile; you will be enraged; you will have butterflies in your stomach; you will take your own trip down memory lane; and most of all, you will wish the story wouldn't end.<br /><br />After all, Eleanor & Park are human and they needed to be loved, just like everybody else does.<br /><br />P.S. This book isn't available in the U.S. until March 2013, but I got my copy for less than $25 USD (including shipping!) on Amazon UK. I highly recommend getting yours sooner rather than later.corns and butterflies in E&P's world -- Eleanor has to deal with some major issues in her home life, as well as being the target of bullies at school.

This book's soundtrack will have you rushing to your iTunes account to buy some of these songs that you only had on cassette or vinyl and really want to hear again.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I don't want to give away too much. Just know that as you read this book: you will laugh out loud; you will knowingly smile; you will be enraged; you will have butterflies in your stomach; you will take your own trip down memory lane; and most of all, you will wish the story wouldn't end.<br /><br />After all, Eleanor & Park are human and they needed to be loved, just like everybody else does.<br /><br />P.S. This book isn't available in the U.S. until March 2013, but I got my copy for less than $25 USD (including shipping!) on Amazon UK. I highly recommend getting yours sooner rather than later.

B002JVWR9U|4.0|This is a pretty decent show. I would love to read the books because they always give more insight into what is going on. The actors that represent the characters do a great job.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|What a surprise this book was.  Seldom have I come upon such a completely satisfying read and I do not give five stars lightly but this book truly earned every one.  I love books that encompass a character's life from innocent childhood to jaded adulthood.  I love the feel of growing with them and seeing how life shapes them and their point of view.  This book did that particularly well.  Also, the moving forward and back in time was done seamlessly and felt very natural to the story's progression.<br /><br />The characters were well developed and unique, each with a distinct voice.  The dialogue felt natural.  I can't think of a single thing I would have liked done differently.  Well done and recommended!

B007VTVGAQ|4.0|First, I'm not a writer so prepare for incoherent ramblings but I have a clear opinion of the new Fiona record.<br /><br />I remember listening to Fiona in the mid 90's as a teen and quite enjoyed the sultry take on the mid 90's alternative sound. Its been at least 15 years since then and I have not listened to Fiona Apple since. I always have a hard time going back and listening to music from that era because it dates itself so bad. It fells like a dark period in popular music, like something that I'm ashamed of from my childhood. I don;t know why I feel that way but the music just didn't stand up to some of the things that where taking place behind the scenes, in the underground.<br /><br />That being said, it was very unlikely for me to even give this latest release a listen at all... but I did always like Fiona and was curious as to how she was going to stay relevant this day and age. I was so surprised when I gave it my first listen. It seemed so relevant, the sound was not poppy at all. I always immediately discount pop music of any kind because its always overly polished and produced, it makes me sick. This was bare bones... full of emotion and so Avante Guard... I would have never expected it. I felt elements of free jazz as well as the rata-tat-tat feeling of an old Tom Waits Record. Today, Fiona has done for popular alternative music what Black flag did for the American Punk movement in the early 80's. She has stylistically taken it to the next level with Avant Guard free jazz chops and unflinching raw emotion . Love the new record!
B007XWFZSA|4.0|The book is a combination of two parts - the actual case interview process and more importantly the rationale behind it. I used Victor Cheng's online resources as a starting point to familiarize myself with the process but used other books for actual practice examples as well as the summary on key frameworks (more as source since I developed my own frameworks and approach that I was comfortable with rather than memorize).<br /><br />While preparing with practice questions, Victor's email newsletters were particularly useful in modifying or developing my own approach and this book condenses many of the important 'advice' that Victor provides in his mails. This book is NOT a collection of practice questions - it covers the basic problem types and standard frameworks. But the rationale behind the case interview process and consulting work is way more important and helps any candidate modify his/her approach. Frameworks can be sourced or developed from anywhere - books, B-school notes etc and there are many practice materials on the net. However, chapters 17-26 are perhaps the most important - the \\"How to\\" for different formats and other softer issues like projecting confidence. In the beginning of my prep, I was to focused on getting the answer or my methodology but only after reading victor's mails and this book did I consciously pay attention to how I came across - engaging the interviewer, using paper effectively etc. which in my experience helped tremendously in getting through.<br /><br />My advice - read this book in parts and at frequent intervals during the preparation and get a bank of practice questions from other sources - books, careers office, or just online. For aspirants I would also recommend signing up for Victor's newsletter - reading advice on a regular basis cements it in your behaviour much more effectively than just reading this book once.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Being a die hard movie buff, I cannot more highly recommend a movie. The first time I watched this it was with no sound, only closed caption because I was laying in bed with my husband asleep next to me. I thought I would only watch a few minutes to see what the movie was about before turning it off. It pulled me in and I continued watching it until 2:30 am(way past my bedtime).<br />It was so deep and thought provoking that I felt myself thinking about it for several days. It was life changing for me and I have started thinking my life through and the choices I have made.<br />The very beginning of the movie may seem a little dreary, but don't stop watching. It isn't that way for most of the movie. I believe this is my favorite movie of all time now. I never buy movies, but this one is the exception. Bravo to the creator, the camera people and all of the actors and actresses. Keep making more movies like this. Memorable and though provoking, uplifting and encouraging.<br /><br />Everyone need to watch this movie in the dark without any interruptions at least once in their lifetime.

B003Y5H5B0|4.0|\\"21 Jump Street\\" shares little in common with the 80's TV series of the same name that helped launch both Johnny Depp's career and the Fox network. Although the film's two main characters Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) both enter into the same undercover police program that has its officers posing as high school students, \\"21 Jump Street\\" the film is really a raunch-with-a-heart-of-gold romp from the Judd Apatow school of moviemaking, with a little bit of classic \\"Lethal Weapon\\" style action-comedy-calamity thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Surprise! The film actually works, and manages to be funny, entertaining and endearing throughout. Much of this has to do with the chemistry of the film's leads. Hill's Schmidt is book smart, but awkward, and Jenko is brawny but oafish. The two originally meet in high school, with Jenko's popular kid bullying Schmidt's nerd, but when they meet again years later in the police academy, they find that their differences actually make for a great friendship.<br /><br />When the two return to high school in the Jump Street program to infiltrate a drug ring, they realize that much has changed over the years. The \\"cool kids\\" are now politically correct, sensitive, and eco-conscious, and they surprisingly accept sensitive Schmidt and reject apathetic Jenko. Jenko instead finds his niche with the science nerds, finding their mastery of technology appealing. In this way, the film makes a skin-deep commentary about how subjective and fleeting things like popularity and acceptance can be.<br /><br />But mostly the whole thing is just played up for lots of laughs, with Hill and Tatum showing that they're up for just about anything; including singing showtunes, dressing up like Peter Pan, reciting poems about chemistry, and, in the film's funniest sequence, getting stoned out of their minds on an illegal designer drug while at school. Two supporting actors also shine in the film, Brie Larson (\\"United States of Tara\\") as the popular theatre aficionado who Schmidt falls for, and David Franco as the film's politically correct high school drug kingpin. Johnny Depp also makes a brief but pivotal and hilarious cameo in the film's manic climax.e popular theatre aficionado who Schmidt falls for, and David Franco as the film's politically correct high school drug kingpin.

1612183956|3.0|A secret service agent wakes up injured in Wayward Pines, Idaho.  His partner is missing, and he's on a mission to find two other agents who had previously gone missing.  He's been in an auto accident, but the hospital doesn't have his wallet or phone, and neither does the sheriff.  Everyone acts just a bit ... off.  He can't seem to leave town, and even begins to doubt his own sanity.<br /><br />I can't even tell you the proper genre of this book without it being a spoiler.  Suffice to say it isn't quite a straightforward mystery or thriller.  It's very well written and suspenseful, and pretty believable right up until the last chapter.  Once you find out what's been going on though, it really strains credibility.  Four secret service agents go missing in one small Idaho town, and nothing ever came of it?  Why was such a confrontational method chosen to introduce newcomers to the town?  What is the long term plan?<br /><br />If the ending had tied things up more cleanly and logically, and the core premise been less odd, I would have given this 5-stars.  Instead I finished what had been a pretty enjoyable reading experience just shaking my head.  Call this one a near miss.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's a really good epic novel. Martin creates an engaging plot, with interesting characters and really makes you wonder if good and evil really are such straightforward concepts. A great start!
0307957934|4.0|I've always had an odd relationship with Robert Harris' books. I loved FATHERLAND but, with the exception of the Cicero trilogy, the rest of his oeuvre leaves me rather cold. I certainly didn't much enjoy his other contemporary novel GHOST. However, last year I heard Harris on R3's Arts & Ideas and was interested enough to put the book on my wishlist... once it was out in paperback.<br /><br />On the radio (I re-listened to the podcast last night) he described FEAR INDEX as a gothic novel and story of ideas. I'm not convinced by either, and if it is a book of ideas - about the nature of financial markets, the self-awareness of ultra-complex computer systems, greed - then they were better articulated in the interview than novel itself. Having said that, and treating it as a simple thriller rather than anything else, I found myself really enjoying this! It starts slowly but by the time Hoffman arrives at work I was gripped and read to the end in a couple of sittings. The prose is dynamic and the text raises enough interesting questions to keep the pages turning. It also has some rather pithy observations. I particularly liked the line about the rich always feeling persecuted.<br /><br />A couple of criticisms. I found the plotting a bit contrived: the VIXAL goes public the very same day that Gabrielle has her exhibition launch. The FRANKENSTEIN parallels were laid on a bit too thick for me; indeed many of the literary references are not worn lightly. There's also far too much foreshadowing. In fact it's like a constant refrain: 'later on...', 'afterwards in the reports...', 'someone remembers...' etc. Harris employs the same technique in FATHERLAND - but just once, which makes it more powerful.<br /><br />All gripes aside this is a slick and very readable thriller.
B000ZJTPLG|4.0|Bought one following a positive review in one of the guitar magazines for use with a Guitar when I am travelling. Most of the music I like is Classic Rock so I bought one of these. They are very good and I will probably by another (Metal or Ac30 - not sure) but could be better.<br /><br />Good points:<br />1. With my cheap guitar I can get a nice crunchy tone on Headphones using it where as my normal amp shows the limitations of the guitars single pickups all to well.<br />2. Its plug and play with little effort it sounds great and is very neat allowing me to walk around the house when playing without lots of loose dangly things... (Despite being a programmer type I don't like being connected to computers etc when playing and prefer to use paper for tab ).<br /><br />Bad points well -<br />1. Possibly the build quality is a bit weak. I worry I will break it eventually.<br />2. Each plug is a one emulation pony. Now I would quite like a few bundled together with a selector switch...<br />3. The price is similar to that of an iPhone input gizmo which could end up being more flexible if I could be bothered to mess around with it (and they would definitely dangle in an annoying way).<br />4. I would love it if they added a tuner into the thing. Then I wouldn't need a tuner and a cable when I go travelling...<br />5. They take AAA batteries. I would much rather it used AA ones (but am very pleased it doesn't take PP3)...<br /><br />Overall though worth the money.
0553801473|5.0|Obvious, right? Referring to the title of my review. We all know this, right? So why do I feel that most of the 180 reviews I scanned through before deciding to buy Book 5 seem to have forgotten this simple fact? The majority of the 180 reviews were very negative, which I just couldn't figure out since I had loved the other books so much. But I had kept reading the reviews because I was waiting for someone to say that they liked this book and not many did. So I will. Simply and succinctly, I hope.<br />This is a spellbinding read, couldn't put it down for the two weeks it took me to read. It is far better than Book 4, and as good or better than the first 3 books, in my opinion. The characterizations are finely drawn; the dialogue is biting and relevant; the GRRM flavor is full and fine, in the descriptions of the world of ASOIAF.<br />And the plot? Each thread of this many-tentacled plot is developed as is appropriate to a series that has two more huge books to go. Maybe GRRM did plan on 3 books in total, but a writer can never be completely sure where the characters are going to take him.<br />If you have come this far, having read the first four books, then please read this book. Maybe I had an advantage which was to be able to read one book after the other in a period of a couple of months, rather than waiting and waiting for the next installment to be published. That must have been frustrating for a lot of readers.<br />Take a chance. Savor the language. Only read a few chapters at a time. Try to have no expectations. I hope that you will think it was worth it.<br />I hope GRRM and I live so long that I will get to see what happens to Young Griff, Dany, the men of The Wall, etc etc. Yes, I loved all the chapters on Dany in Meereen. The dragon chapters are incredible. If either GRRM or I don't live so long, then it was still a stunning ride.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This series clearly isn't a documentary, doesn't pretend to be one, and never aspired to be one. Moreover it was never advertised or marketed as one. It was created with the express intent of entertaining a crowd. You don't watch this series to learn more about the Roman past. Rather, you watch it with a bowl of your favorite snack in your lap and a bottle of beer within reach. You cheer when the dramatized blood flies through the air and don't care that it's clearly fake because it was meant to look over the top rather than realistic. This series is about pushing boundaries, narrating an amazingly intricate plot line, and dazzling an audience. It's trite. It's mindless. It's the way the adrenaline addict relaxes. It's amazing.

B005R4255C|5.0|This posthumous 2 CD release throws more than 40 hits of Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5 into the blender. It is actually the soundtrack to Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour, a circus extravaganza by Cirque du Soleil.<br /><br />The remixes enhance the existing tracks and do not alter them in a drastic fashion.<br /><br />There are some 'full versions' of certain songs in that they are three to four minutes long. Ballads like Childhood, Gone Too Soon and Will You Be There have pretty decent durations. And Ben is given a beautiful Oriental treatment.<br /><br />Medleys and Megamixes include Beat It/State Of Shock with the latter featuring only a drum sequence sans Jackson's and Jagger's vocals. There's an Immortal Megamix of Can You Feel It/Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough/Billie Jean/Black Or White. Some of the medleys segue into one another seamlessly like non stop dance albums while others are stand alone features. I especially like the immortal version of  Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' and the Jackson 5 Medley.<br /><br />Songs not featured on The Essential Michael Jackson such as Workin' Day And Night (performed on the Dangerous Tour DVD), Isn't It Scary/Threatened and This Place Hotel are here. I also heard samples of Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me.<br /><br />At the start of The Mime Segment (Disc 1 Track 11), Michael says this very curious thing :\\"I love to write songs...it's very spiritual and I'm just the source that which it comes.\\" So music do come from a spiritual source and the artist is just a medium/messenger.<br /><br />The design and packaging is vibrant, refreshing and visually exciting, making MJ appear larger than life.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great remix CD and will complement your collection. As for me, I just can't control my feet!
B0080CL0HM|5.0|This movie is by far one of the best period movies made in some time. Take a look at the cast, the costumes and the sets. This movie far surpassed my expectations ( and they were ridiculously high). I will be buying this when it hits DVD. ~Bella
B005EYP8PO|4.0|I only bought this because:<br /><br />1) I do not collect U2 singles. So the b sides and rarities are a draw.<br /><br />2) The store was offering this at a hefty discount of 40 percent.<br /><br />The positive side of the deluxe is the b sides are very good. Stand outs include Lady With The Spinning Head and Blow Your House Down. Satellite Of Love is really refreshing. There's also a serviceable cover of Cole Porter's Night And Day.<br /><br />Decent mixes include Mysterious Ways (Perfecto Mix), Even Better Than The Real Thing (Fish Out Of Water Remix) and The Lounge Fly Mix.<br /><br />The not so attractive features are:<br /><br />Why include the single version of Even Better Than The Real Thing? It's too similar to the album one and feels like a repeat listen. I would have welcomed the dance version of Even Better Than The Real Thing which is on the CD single.<br /><br />The discs are not remastered. However, the original album is still one of the most atmospheric and 'spaced out' recordings, creating the other worldly feeling. Only Zooropa can top this.<br /><br />The booklet is basically a reprint of the old one with some extra pages of credits. Do not expect rare and unpublished photos here.<br /><br />There may be two extra pictures in the fold out but that's about it. The montage is largely similar to the old with slight variations. Since this is a 20th anniversary reissue, how about a clever redesign to knock out eyes out?<br /><br />The original naked picture of Adam Clayton is censored with criss cross strokes of the paint brush. So ladies will be left high and dry.<br /><br />This deluxe version will disappoint true U2 fanatics but for on/off buyers like me, it will do just fine.

It is set in NY and based on life of single 20 something's.  The plot builds quickly leaving you wanting to know more.  It is intriguing and well written.

Not for the under 18 set!  Atleast I would not want my daughters reading this.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Where do I begin? The Dark Knight is not only the best sequel, it's arguably the best comic book adaptation ever made. It picks up right where Batman Begins left off with the Joker's calling card in Jim Gordon's (Gary Oldman) evidence baggie. There's not much that I can say about this movie that has not been said over, and over, again. One thing I can say is, if you did not like this movie at all, then this definitely isn't the genre you should be experimenting with. I'm definitely no judge of tastes in film, because a couple of my guilty pleasures are the widely hated G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The Dark Knight has so much more to like than the average comic book film. Rather than focusing on setting up spectacular action set pieces like most movies of the genre, Christopher Nolan puts drama and chaotic suspense at the heart of this one. We've all seen the original Batman, so there's no need for the Joker to run around Gotham with a Tommy gun like he did in Tim Burton's take. Without saying too much, I'll say that the Joker has a much bigger agenda in this film than he did the first time. From the start we are introduced to him in the midst of a well planned, and well choreographed bank heist, shot with state of the art IMAZ cameras. The picture is crystal clear in the IMAX scenes. That is definitely cinematography at its absolute best, thanks to not only Chris Nolan, but also his DP, Wally Pfister.<br /><br />Off the bat, we are meant to see just how intelligent the Joker really is, despite being the most qualified for a life sentence in Arkham Asylum. He has to be one of the most cold and calculating villains that I have ever seen. This Joker has no compassion, and nothing for the audience to sympathize with. He is truly a \\"villain\\", in every sense of the word. Never have I seen an actor capture the essence of a character from literature, and then expand upon it, as perfectly as Heath Ledger did with his. There has been much debate as to which actor was the best Joker. In my opinion neither came close to Mark Hamill's voice work for the animated series. All jokes aside, the performances in both movies are beyond amazing. I don't even find it necessary to label one as better, because they are both great. I honestly believe Heath Ledger would not have won Best Supporting Actor if he was still living due to Academy politics, but he more than deserved it, and I'm glad he won it post-mortem. We get all hung up on the joker, but all of the other actors in The Dark Knight did phenomenal jobs as well, especially Aaron Eckhart as Harvey 'Two Face' Dent. My only gripe was Katie Holmes not returning for her role, but over a billion dollars later, that's her problem. Christian Bale's Bat-growl was fine to me. That's a common complaint that I consider unnecessary nitpicking.<br /><br />I also have to mention my second favorite composer, Hans Zimmer returning from Batman Begins. The musical score in the two movies was another thing that I thought was damn near flawless. The plot of The Dark Knight addressed my only complaint about Batman Begins. There isn't anything I can think of in this movie that was too unrealistic in the advanced world we live in today. The premise is believable, and the story draws you in without ever letting go. No spoiler intended, but the way it ended left so much to the imagination. It appeared that the Joker would have had a guaranteed spot in the third film, but now I think they should just leave that character alone. Chris Nolan has a large task on his hands for The Dark Knight Rises, but as the saying goes, \\"In Nolan I Trust.\\" Topping this sequel will be a challenge. Enough about the film, because by now we all know that The Dark Knight will be talked about for many years to come. As far as the transfer goes, it's pretty much reference material. As I mentioned before, the IMAX scenes are amazing. The standard scenes are great, but not on par with the IMAX ones. The audio is all you could want, and then some. As far as the extras go, there should have been a commentary, because this is such a landmark film. There should have been a memoriam for Heath Ledger. I would have appreciated a more in-depth \\"making of\\" documentary. But alas, what we have is what we have. I could go on and on, but there's really no point. Enough has been said about it. Highest recommendation to everyone.<br /><br />9.5/10udio is all you could want, and then some. As far as the extras go, there should have been a commentary, because this is such a landmark film.

B0040YFR1Y|4.0|Admittedly, it took me too long to see the first two Predator films. I actually saw them both after Director Nimrod Antal and Producer Robert Rodriguez's sequel. This one is nothing compared to the first film, but it's a hell of a lot better than Predator 2 and the AVP films. It isn't anything to write home about, but I'd say Predators is decent entertainment. I looked forward to it since the day I heard it was in production, and since I didn't have anything to compare it to besides the AVPs, I didn't know just how much it had in common with the original classic. So with that being said, I'll just start off with what I didn't like. Most of all, that would have to be how much of an homage it is to Predator. Now don't get me wrong. An homage can be a beautiful thing when done in moderation, but they went a little far with it. This was clearly a film made by fans of Predator for fans of Predator. After a sequel and three spin-offs that left bad tastes in the fans' mouths, it was time for a reboot that was handled with care, but so many scenes are completely recreated to the point of some fans accused it of being a rip-off instead. I also had trouble adjusting to some of the CGI, mainly the fire when Fishburne's ship explodes, and other minor things. It took me a little while to get used to the dogs, but upon subsequent viewings, they've grown on me. I'll just say that they shouldn't have had the special effects done in-house at Troublemaker. But as it turns out, after inflation, this movie had a smaller budget than the first film, so you can expect them to cut some corners.<br /><br />There was also some pretty uninspired dialogue. The script was just plain boring at times, and it was so cliche and predictable that it made me feel like I was watching a B movie with A movie production values. That could be considered a compliment to some, or an insult, depending on your tastes. I think it's a little bit of both. The actors must have known they didn't have much of a script to work with, because they were all one note. I probably shouldn't blame the actors, because they didn't write their own lines. They did the jobs that were expected of them with what they were given. Obviously the lead guy, Adrien Brody caught a lot of flak for being too skinny and not tough enough for his role. I say that's a bunch of b.s. He wasn't skinny. He beefed up for the role. Nevertheless, when you compare anyone to Arnold Schwarzenegger's big muscle-bound ass, who doesn't look skinny? I thought he was okay. He wasn't great by any means, but I'd be lying through my teeth if I said Schwarzenneger was a great \\"actor\\" in the original. Arnie kicked ass, most definitely. He was perfect in his role, but a great performance? Not really. But that's not what these movies are made for anyway. Brody may never have really showed me why he was chosen for the leading role, besides the fact that he won an Oscar, but I was still never disappointed in him. Danny Trejo and Laurence Fishburne are a couple of favorites of mine, but their screen time is so limited that you may not even remember they were in this movie unless you paid attention. That pissed me off a little bit, but I can live with it.<br /><br />I felt like the pacing was a bit off as well. I actually enjoyed the first half of the film, which played out just like the original, except for these guys not knowing each other. The suspense is what was so great about Predator. Keeping the monster in the shadows until it was time for it to strike worked quite well in 87, so why not try to recapture that? I honestly feel like they did a good job. The very beginning is Brody's character, Royce, falling from the sky, which is a different way to start a film, so I commend their willingness to take a chance. They said that the original openning was Royce on a Black Ops mission or something, taking out some guys, then getting kidnapped by the Predators. I would have preferred that beginning, but like I said, they took a chance, and I respect that. The first half is so uneven when you add in the second half though. The first half is tense and exciting. You feel like you're actually lost in the jungle with them. The second half turns into a 'by-the-numbers' action flick. Nothing original will be found in the last half, or even the entire film, but it never gets bad. So don't get me wrong. This movie was so much like Predator, save for the alien dogs. The gatling gun was cool homage to Bill Duke's character Mac, who happens to be my third favorite character in the original, after Dutch and the Predator himself. It's definitely a B movie with an A movie's budget. As for the predators themselves? Yeah, they're still badass. In fact, they're even more badass because there are different species. Now for what I actually liked.<br /><br />I liked the eerie and ominous feel of the film. The dark pallete and cinematography served the tone very well, and the music is just plain fun. I loved it. I thought the music was a great callback to Alan Silvestri's original score. The one comic relief character was such a caricature, but luckily his worst moments were left on the cutting room floor (according to the deleted scenes that are available in the extras). This film should also be given credit for using the same set over and over, but never getting redundant or old. I've done enough studying of films (not all in class) to recognize redressed sets, and this one is full of them. Even so, I thought it was beautiful. Beautifully dressed sets, beautifully shot locations, and even with some questionable CGI every now and again, beautiful creatures. I also liked that the film doesn't try too hard to over explain everything. Face it, there is not much to tell that we can't figure out on our own. We're following a group of lost criminals and killers, and a doctor, through an alien jungle, who are being tested by possibly, the galaxy's best hunters. This movie may not have been all that we were hoping for, but it's still decent entertainment. If you don't care about it before you see it, you probably won't be impressed when the credits roll. As for the quality of the disc, it's very good. Almost reference PQ and AQ, and it has some very good features that don't last long enough. So all in all, I recommend it to anyone who is already interested in it.<br /><br />6.5/10hance, and I respect that. The first half is so uneven when you add in the second half though.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|The box came looking really beat up, but the discs are just fine, with only a few scratches you can only see with a light. I love this show, but be warned that you are paying the same rate per episode as if you bought a full length season for 50 bucks.
B003UESJFG|4.0|Megamind has been called a cheap imitation due to its similarities to The Incredibles and Despicable Me. I don't think that's fair. First and foremost, it isn't very similar to Despicable Me at all, unless you want to say every single story told from a villain's perspective is also an imitation. If not, then that's where Megamind and Despicable Me's likeness end. Megamind is not a cheap DreamWorks version of The Incredibles either, because while The Incredibles is a serious homage to superheroes, Megamind is a light-hearted, satirical look at the life of a supervillain. Completely oppposite sides of the spectrum. Family-focused drama is at the base of The Incredibles, comedy is at Megamind's. The cast is quite funny, and very entertaining on their own. Just listening to the tones in the characters voices can be a good time. Add in the various facial expressions and bodily mannerisms, and the characters feel very real. Sure Brad Pitt could have had a bigger role, but his absence didn't bother me much, because Will Ferrell more than carried the film on his own.<br /><br />Despite the occasional stupid joke, like the mispronunciation of simple words and such, Megamind has its moments for both adults and children. And along with the humor, there are some soft spots as well. Honestly, they may not phase older audiences much, because the comedic aspect is so overpowering that it can be hard to feel other emotions, but nevertheless, the drama is there. Unfortunately, Megamind never really rises above being just another fun animated movie. It favors younger children more than adults, but it would be stupid to call that a flaw. That's not to say it won't resonate with older audiences though. Granted I'll probably pull The Incredibles off of my shelf if I'm in the mood for an animated superhero/villain flick, but I can still see myslef returning to Megamind in coming years. The script could have been a bit more inspired, but the animation is top notch. Textures were spot on. Leather and fabric, dust and smoke, fire and water, fur and hair, etc. They all looked real and natural. Everything was overly detailed to the point of being a distraction at times (in a god way). With that being sai, it's not another Shrek or How To Train Your Dragon, and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to Pixar's work, but it's stil good enough to recommend.<br /><br />7/10Leather and fabric, dust and smoke, fire and water, fur and hair, etc. They all looked real and natural.

B005IZLPMY|4.0|After years of awaiting a movie worth this historically rich character's name, I'm happy to announce that a good Captain America film finally here. I was quite blown away by how much I enjoyed it. My fear of the worst kept my expectations in check as I waited for The First Avenger to hit theaters. For a while, I expected it to be mediocre to moderately good, but I retained a cautious optimism. I didn't have enough faith in it to hype the movie up to friends and family, but I prayed it would be as good as the previous films in the Avengers Saga. Being a huge Marvel fan, I was obliged to see it no matter how good or bad critics said it was. Surprisingly, it turned out to be just what Joe Johnston's credentials promised. It was a good old fashioned throwback action adventure flick that's fun (for the family, despite a few shockingly violent moments), humorous, and surprisingly, emotionally resonant. I thought it was a notch or two above Thor, albeit I wouldn't recommend one over the other. Johnston's last few films (The Wolfman, Jurassic Park III and Hidalgo -- two of which I actually enjoyed) didn't have great receptions, so it was understandable for most to be weary of him directing, but I think he did a damn good job with material that had the potential to be very silly. The character, Captain America, is one of those characters that everyone knows of, but not many people care about. He probably comes across as a boring character, due to his overtly American themes, simplistic superpowers, and his shield.<br /><br />In fact, the film could have easily been quite boring, or laughably silly, but I'm pleased to say that this movie is none of the above, and neither are most of Cap's latest publishings, to be honest. This is a classic case of not judging a book by its cover. Granted, there are inherently cheesy moments throughout the film, but what do you expect from an apparent propaganda piece about an unlikely soldier with an American flag costume and a big shield, who is battling an evil Nazi with red skin that is bent on world domination? I actually loved the cheese factor. It went quite well with the 40's WWII atmosphere, and the film as a whole. Like I mentioned before, this film was a throwback to the old fashioned action adventure movies like Indiana Jones and The Rocketeer (another Johnston film). There's an automatic cheese factor that goes with the territory. Early flags were raised by internet dwellers about Chris Evans not being right for the leading role. I never bought into those complaints. I mean, have you guys seen him? Blonde hair, blue eyes, quirky innocence, toned body, and actual acting abilities (if you've seen him in anything besides Fantastic Four -- which he was actually one of the best aspects of). What the hell else did we need for him to be right for the role? I don't know, but I had faith in him and he delivered. Some people have said that he was bland and just a good guy with no internal conflict, and for the most part, I agree. That's who he is supposed to be though. His character was developed as he grew up, due to him being physically inane. That was the very reason why Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) recruited him.<br /><br />I loved Evans as Steve Rogers, and even more as Cap. He just flat out kicked ass, in my opinion. He went against what we've become accustomed to in superhero movies, and it worked well. Spoilers: When Cap threw a knife into a Hydra agents back, then threw two other Hydra agents right out of a plane, I knew his portrayal would be a legend for years to come. I really was not expecting that kind of brutality in a cartoonish comic book movie where us older fans have come to expect major toning down for young children. I mean, he is a soldier, and this is a war, but you get my point. It would be asinine for him to go through all of that trouble trying to enlist and getting turned down, only to go overseas and just knock his enemies out. Killing is what war is about, so hats off to Johnston and his writers, as well as Marvel Studios and Paramount for having the testicular fortitude to let that happen in The First Avenger. Another surprisingly violent moment was when the older woman in the hidden base got shot and we actually saw the impact. Well, she did have a machine gun, but even so, I applaud them again for letting that happen in a family blockbuster. It added to the seriousness of the situation, and left more of an impact. The audience should take from that, that the Nazi spy who gunned down the older women needed to be taken down as soon as possible. While I did appreciate the mature sparks of violence, there were also other noticeable tone downs that conflicted with them.<br /><br />Now I'll admit that this is just me nitpicking, but that's what reviews are for, right? Similar to the Decepticon canons in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, I have to say that I was distracted by the way that Hydra's advanced weapons disintegrated their victims, pretty much reducing them to dust, instead of actually showing the devastation of the weapons like they did with regular guns. I'm not saying that it was necessary to show blood splatter when the cosmic blasts impacted. I understand the ratings system, but what they chose to do was pushing it, even for science fiction. Speaking of those weapons, some have argued that they seemed more appropriate for a film set in the future, more so than one set in the 1940's. That is an understandable quibble, but that was the point. The cosmic cube allowed Hydra to develop weaponry that was far beyond anything from the time period. That was why Red Skull went through such lengths to attain the cube, and develop the Hydra tech with it. Speaking of Red Skull, I have to say I loved him in this movie. Perhaps he was not as menacing as he could have been, but, I'll be damned if he wasn't one of the coolest villains I've seen in a while. Hugo Weaving should just play villains in everything for the rest of his career. He does it too well. After seeing his performance, I cannot think of another actor who I would have chosen over him. I'm glad to have him immortalized in the Marvel Universe now, and I hope he returns for the sequel. I'm sure he will because he's obviously not dead, only teleported to another dimension or plane. Actually, I think the whole cast was great.<br /><br />Haley Atwell was probably the best main love interest of all the Avengers Saga films, which is surprising given she's the least recognizable of all of the actresses who played them. If I were to rank them, I'd do it as follows: Haley Atwell, Gwyneth Paltrow, Natalie Portman, and lastly, Liv Tyler. As for Atwell's character, Peggy Carter, I loved how they chose to keep her sexiness hidden until she appeared in that stunning red dress. Her character was introduced as a tough one, but she showed compassion towards Steve. She was a very well developed character, and I'll be sorely disappointed if this is the last we see of her. Spoilers: The moment she and Steve shared before he crashed into the ice was moving, and as I was feeling for them, I was quite surprised that this film managed elicit such an emotional response from me. The same film that I feared would be drowned in mediocrity. They did such a fantastic job at developing thirt relationship. Sadly, I'm pretty sure this is her only outing. There were quite a few moments when I sincerely cared for the fate of the characters. Not only Steve and Peggy, but Bucky (Sebastian Stan) as well. He has one of the saddest, and most surprising moments in the film. Even as a fan of the comics, who knew what would happen to Bucky, as well as who he later becomes, I have to admit that moment got me. I mentioned Stanley Tucci briefly before, but I didn't say that I enjoyed his performance as the doctor responsible for Steve's transformation. I thought Tucci did a pretty good job with the minimal screentime he had.<br /><br />What more can one say about Tommy Lee Jones thathasn't been said before? He was primarily comic relief, and he was quite funny. Dominic Cooper (The Devil's Double, An Education) was an appropriate choice as Howard Stark. He was a nice counterpart to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. I was pleased with the Howling Commandos as well. Neal McDonough was great as Dum Dum Doogan. His character wasn't as fleshed out as I would have liked, considering the role he played in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s development, but he was fine nonetheless. Now all of this praise is not to say that I don't think the film is flawed. It's far from perfect, and many people will most likely have issues with the overall cheesiness of the plot and stereotypical portrayals of the characters, but I enjoyed it very much. It was a great tie-in to the Avengers Saga, but nothing took precedence over Cap's origin story. This is first, and foremost, a Captain America film.The build up for The Avengers has been an exciting one to experience. Each link in the chain is solid, with some obviously being stronger than others. I think Captain America: The First Avenger falls in at second best in the series, after the first Iron Man. As for the transfer, the picture quality is as good as one would expect a modern release to look. Detail is strong and fairly crisp, although some may confuse the Director and Cinematographer's choice of dim lighting and color timing as soft. The sound is pretty much flawless. As far as the extras go, they leave a lot to be desired. The best of the bunch is without a doubt, the commentary. The featurettes, as well as the Marvel One-Shot, are short, but sweet. All in all, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Note: I own the Best Buy exclusive version, but the only difference is the cardboard slipcover.s it too well.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|It happens to me quite often that I'll go see a movie the day it comes out and really enjoy it. But then over time forget what I loved so much about it, and when I finally get the dvd all those months later, I watch it again and love it even more than I did when I first saw it. The same thing happened to me with Iron Man, Star Trek, Batman Begins, Casino Royale, and a whole laundry list of what are now most of my favorite all-time movies. District 9 is no exception. I recently watched it again, and it was ten times better the second time. Neil Blomkamp is a relatively unknown director, but he created a masterpiece. I think D9 is a classic, and it definitely should not be forgotten as the years go by. Sadly, I believe it will be forgotten because of the big shadow that Avatar casts. One thing that District 9 has is an uncanny originality that I had almost forgot existed in the movie business today. Most notibly in the alien sub-genre. Too many alien films follow the same suit. Unlike most other alien movies, the prawns are not portrayed as villains. They are victims. It kind of made me sad to see how they were mistreated. One thing D9 does do is evoke different emotions. The movie is gritty and tense, sometimes sad, yet funny at times. Despite the fact that it is not a conventional action movie, the scenes when the action does pick up are breathtaking. Literally, if you're squemish. I happen to be a very little bit squemish, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching mens' arms, heads, and even entire torsos a couple times, get disintergrated by the prawns' various guns.<br /><br />The cinematography in this film is nothing short of amazing. I never thought it was possible to be that captivated by the sight of a poor African slum, but D9 managed to surprise me more than a few times. The visual effects are spot on. I would even go as far as to say that they were way more realistic and believable than my favorite movie of 2009 (I doubt i have to name it). I have to mention the transformation of Wikus himself, brilliantly played by Sharlto Copley. I was glad that they used actual make up and tangible materials to create the prawn arm, rather than relying completely on CGI. I do love it, but I still have to admit that CGI has become a crutch for most. Speaking of Sharlto Copley's performance, how did he not get any major awards nominations? At least the Academy gave District 9 a nod for Best Picture, Visual Effects, Adapted Screenplay and Editing. Rather than the Best Pic nomination being a spot filler, I think it actually could have been a contender if the competion were not so strong this year. Nevertheless, District 9 is a work of genius and i do hope that there is a District 10. There were a lot of hints to it at the end of D9, so they better not disappoint. Thank God Peter Jackson and his team couldn't make that Halo movie they original set out to make, otherwise we would never have gotten District 9.transformation of Wikus himself, brilliantly played by Sharlto Copley.

0316017930|5.0|This was written by my 14-year old brother:<br /><br />Outliers is a great read that all would enjoy. Malcolm Gladwell's basic argument is no one can rise out of nothing. Every outlier has something in their background that allowed them to become successful. Sometimes it could include some luck or randomness and sometimes it's just plain old hard work, but usually it's a combination of both. It could be being born at a certain time that is considered the \\"right time\\". For instance, the cutoff date for a kid who wants to play hockey in Canada is January 1. So, if you are born on that day or any date close to January 1 then you are pretty lucky because you would be the oldest in that group of players so you would be relatively better trained. The more training the better you become because practice makes perfect. The better you are the better chances you have at making it to the big leagues like the NHL. That is how Malcolm Gladwell approaches his points and leaves you awestruck with the data he describes and explains.<br /><br />This book is possibly the most thought-provoking book I've read. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the ways of success at an early age. I am 14 and this has really helped me choose what career is best for me based on what my talents are and applying the 10,000 hour rule that Gladwell talked about to my particular circumstances. Gladwell has brought many ideas to my attention, such as that a high IQ doesn't absolutely determine success and that hard work can be the overriding factor. This is what I call a good book.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I noticed that I had experienced many moments during the book where I was shocked and contemplating how I hadn't thought of particular things Gladwell discusses before. I just thought that success had everything to do with talent and smarts before I read this book. Like I said before, I'm 14 so I really like spending some quality time with my Playstation 3 so when my brother recommended that I read this book, I was more than hesitant. But, it turned out to be a great read and a mind-opener. So I say thank you Malcolm Gladwell for your amazing way of hooking a reader and changing the way a 14 year old boy spends his summer. :)
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Not to my surprise, Avatar was beyond amazing. Up until I actually saw it for myself, I had been letting the critics' opinions influence how I felt about this movie. But as I got ready to go see it I erased all those feelings I had, and it blew me away. And NO, it wasn't just the visual effects that I loved so much. The story was solid as well. I have read the many complaints of all of the peoples who were not as pleased with the film as I was, but I don't really care about what they have to say. It took James Cameron over a decade to finish his project, and some people are just not going to appreciate all the hard work that went into making it. Until the time comes for them to do it themselves, they are going to continue to nitpick every minor detail. Honestly, it doesn't really matter if they do or not because it's already a strong number one as the highest grossing film of all time, so obviously somebody liked it. But about the film. I'll start where everyone can agree, with the visual effects. I don't really think they raise the bar, because they were so expensive to make, that it was damn near impossible for them to be bad. The effects in Avatar are nothing short of beautiful. The various colors in the forests are all vivid and lively during the day, and equally beautiful in the darkness of the night. And the colorful creatures that inhabit the moon called Pandora, are also just as detailed and beautiful to look at. The supposedly upgraded 3D didn't blow me away with its innovation, but the sense of immersion was a welcome treat. It really enhanced the experience. Some of the people I saw the movie with said, \\"If that's what Heaven looks like, then I'm ready to go right now!\\" That quote says it all for the visuals. Now let's get to the story.<br /><br />Of course the story was not entirely unique, but it was still good enough to make me want to watch this movie again and again. People love to say this story was just a knock off of Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas, but I have to disagree. So what if a man joined the group he was originally against, and so what if he fell in love with the princess. Nothing is entirely new these days. Almost every fresh idea has been taken some way or another. Getting past the plot, there are a few script problems. The script is the touchiest subject. On one hand, a USC Linguist was brought in to create a unique language for the Na'vi to speak. And he did a fantastic job with that. It is very apparent that a lot of effort went into that aspect, but on the other, we have the people. For the most part, everyone's lines are fine. Except for a lot of Colonel Quaritch and Trudy. A lot of what Col. Quaritch said was too basic and dull for my taste, but he doesn't get enough screen time to ruin the movie. James Cameron admitted that he only spent two to three weeks of the ten years plus on the script, and it shows. But this movie is still a classic, and one of the best of 2009. It's arguably one of the best of the decade. Proof of how great it is was the running time. Avatar was about two hours and forty minutes, but it went by so fast that it left me wanting more. Usually I'm happy with where a long movie ends, but this one was different. I could have easily sat through another half hour. So a few corny lines in a nearly three hour movie don't take anything away from the experience.<br /><br />It's a definite must-see for all ages. And I don't believe that it's only good in 3D. Of course everyone should see it in 3D while it's still in the first theatres, just to get the maximum out of it, but seeing it in 2D would not take anything away from its greatness. For a long while, Avatar was my favorite movie of 2009, but after seeing Star Trek a couple more times that one took over, then the same thing happened with District 9. That doesn't mean that I cannot make up my mind, just that 2009 was a fantastic year for the Science Fiction genre. Now finally, the Extended Collector's Edition additions...inone word? Wow. The two new cuts add more than I thought they would. With the exception of the scene in the bar on Earth when the guy slaps his girlfriend, I think all of the extra footage should never have been cut. It was really essential plotline stuff. Neytiri's sister's subplot adds so much. And the sturmbeest hunt scene showed us how Jake earned his title as a \\"Stone Cold Aerial Hunter\\". Why was that not in the theatrical cut? IMAX runtime constraints shouldn't be an excuse to cut valuable footage. I also have to say I appreciated the Tsu'tey death scene. That's not a spoiler because everyone on the planet has seen this movie. And the extras, oh man the extras were top notch. This edition really feels like something that gets released a decade or two after a film has had time to settle into pop culture. What am I talking about? This is freaking Avatar. Only the biggest film ever made. Highly recommended.one word? Wow. The two new cuts add more than I thought they would.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|The absolute best animation I have ever seen. How fitting, considering Toy Story was the pioneer of digital animation. I was four when the first Toy Story came out, and eight when the second one did. I pretty much grew up on Disney movies, Toy Story and Lion King being the two I watched most. Probably a few hundred times between the two of them (no exaggeration). I literally grew up with Woody, Buzz and the gang. Coincidentally, I started my first year of college last year, so Andy and I share a connection that is very personal to me. The people over at Pixar have done what has only happened a few times in history. Let's hope they take home the Oscar for Best Picture like the Lord of the Rings did, although I wouldn't get my hopes up. Those Academy douche bags... But back to Pixar. They created a damn near perfect trilogy. I loved this movie. This may be blasphemy to some of you, but I have to admit that Shrek 2 still holds the crown as my all time favorite animated film. After that is How To Train Your Dragon, then probably Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 2 tied at third. Ratatouille is tied with Monster's Inc. for a very close fourth. As you can see, Pixar dominates my list, that does go on, by the way. Anyway, I think this was a perfect way to close the trilogy. The last fifteen minutes or so were very heartfelt and touching. I was on the verge of tears. When Woody said goodbye to Andy in the closing moments, I felt as if he was talking directly to me. The movie is altogether excellent.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't impress me as much as everyone said it would. After reading over a dozen reviews with perfect scores, I had expectations that almost always lead to disappoint. I'm happy to say I was not. Not even close. The script is very well done. The music is just as great. The voice acting never felt insincere. And most importantly, I never got the feeling that some studio executive told the geniuses at Pixar to make this movie because it would clean out the pockets of millions of moviegoers I'm talking to you DreamWorks. I almost hated Shrek after the third movie, then they did a fourth?! No, I never got that feeling from this movie at all. It was a rejuvenation to a property that was already loved by almost everyone. The graphical detail in the picture was incredible. It saddens me to know that their adventures are over, but I'm glad it ended the way it did. Waiting eleven years to do the final entry was probably not intentional, but it worked out for the best. At least for me because of my age corresponding to Andy's. I'm really going to miss those toys. \\"How is the BD transfer,\\" one might ask. Simply put, it's \\"Pixar Perfect\\". Toy Story 3 comes with one of the best Disney/Pixar slipcovers available. Beautiful embossing, and the color scheme fits the film perfectly. As for the extra content, there is plenty. There is an audio commentary, and a Picture-in-Picture commentary, an abundance of featurettes, and the short that played prior to the film when it was in theatres (\\"Day & Night\\"). There are also your standard Pixar extras, like the the self-calibration and other publicity featurettes. All around, the extras are very good.cause it would clean out the pockets of millions of moviegoers I'm talking to you DreamWorks. I almost hated Shrek after the third movie, then they did a fourth?!

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|To be honest, the first time I saw Up in theatres, I liked it, but I just did not see what everyone was so excited about. I kept thinking to myself, \\"What's the big deal?\\" I am very happy to say that I finally see what the big deal is. Up is a beautiful, heartfelt story. It captures the life of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner) perfectly from his youth, to his golden years. The montage near the beginning was one of the most wonderful things that I have ever seen, and probably the most wonderful thing that I have seen in a Pixar film to date. The scene itself set a variety of moods, from sad to joyous, but the music really brought it to life. It was perfectly set to another great score by Michael Giacchino, who also blew me away with his Star Trek score. In my opinion, Up has to be the best Pixar film yet. They have done nothing but good things for the last couple of decades. It seems like everything they make becomes a classic. Until I saw Up for the second time, I would never have imagined myself ever saying that it was the best they have done so far. But it is the truth. The imagination is a beautiful thing, and those guys over at the Disney Pixar studios have plenty of it. I loved the maturity in the tone of the story, even though it remained a children's' movie all the way through. I'm sure not too many kids would have picked up on the little hints like, *Possible Spoiler* why they were sad in the pregnancy doctor's office, or why Ellie couldn't make it up that hill, etc. But those are the kinds of things that make both children and adults love these movies so much. There is something in it for every single person in the crowd. Everything in the film is well done, but this story is undoubtedly character driven.<br /><br />The characters were all delightful. Carl reminded me so much of my own grandpa. So sad deep inside from the lost of his wife, and so grumpy because of his sadness, but also so caring for others and eager for adventure. Russell, I'll admit he annoyed me at first, but I soon realized that's what he was supposed to do. We were supposed to feel what Carl felt. Then over time, as we heard Russell's story and saw how nice of a person he was, we grew to care about him like we did for Carl. Doug and Kevin were great from the start. Even though Doug started off trying to capture Kevin for his master, he was always so sweet and funny that we never disliked him for it. Kevin made me laugh out loud a couple of times, especially when he mimicked Carl. Charles Muntz was an unlikely, yet great villain. He was the sole motivation for Ellie and Carl's fixation on South America, but his dedication to his quest drove him crazy. This was just an all around fantastic movie. The only reason I cannot give it a full score is the little things that I didn't like, like the dogs flew the airplanes and tied Russell up. The explanation for them being able to speak was acceptable, and the fact that they could speak added dimension to them as characters, and ultimately the story itself. But then they did those things that pulled me out of the story. Yeah, I do understand that the whole premise of a floating house, and everything is not really based on anything practical, and nor does it try to pretend that it is possible. Of course it's a children's movie, and they are expected to be like that. I just didn't like those aspects of it, but they didn't take anything away from how brilliant the overall film was. It was a masterpiece. I cannot wait for Toy Story 3, and whatever Pixar has slated after that.it he annoyed me at first, but I soon realized that's what he was supposed to do.

B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Many say \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is director Woody Allen's cinematic love letter to Paris. It certainly is, but the film is also a well-made bitter-sweet romantic comedy. What is most remarkable about it is the optimistic and relaxed feel of the entire film. As a movie, \\"Midnight in Paris\\" may lack the charms of \\"Annie Hall\\" or the insights of \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors,\\" but Woody Allen's latest work is a delightful mixture of off-beat humor and wry self-awareness.<br /><br />Owen Wilson plays Gil, an American who wants be a novelist, but whose current work is doing re-writes for Hollywood movies. While staying in Paris with his fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, Gil, who is writing a novel about a \\"nostalgia shop,\\" is given a chance to travel in time back to the 1920s, and meet the artists including Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), as well as Picasso's lover, beautiful and charming Adriana (Marion Cotillard).<br /><br />What Gil eventually learns about his own vision of the glorified past is nothing new, though it makes an interesting contrast to the nostalgic tone seen here, and in the director's works in the past (\\"Radio Days\\" for instance). Owen Wilson is perfectly cast as Allen's alter ego-like protagonist, through whose eye we see the streets of Paris and the city's legends. This is a charming comedy that is, if not profound, still humorous.
B002ZG97RY|3.0|I don't quite know how to sum Green Zone up. It's not a bad movie by any means, but I don't think I could recommend it to everyone either. Green Zone marks the third collaboration of director Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon. The two of them are responsible for two of my favorite films, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. It's safe to say they know each other well. Greengrass has made his position on the 9/11 conspiracy crystal clear with United 93 and this film. He also did a great job at letting Damon take charge and drive this film home. He gave a strong performance, and that goes without saying Damon stepped right into his standard issue military boots, and everything from then on felt so authentic, that I believed he could really be in the military. He was even surrounded by real-life soldiers, and he fit in to perfection. He plays U.S. Army Sergeant Miller, who after being sent on various dead end missions, decides to go against his orders and discover the truth as to what's really going on with the supposed Weapons of Mass Destruction that the U.S. went to war with Iraq for in the first place. That is already a bit of a touchy subject, and I think that's really where I could not connect with the film. I want to really like it a lot, but I just know that some people are actually going to believe the fictional story. So that's why I think that this movie is trying to make too bold of a statement for what it is, which is false.<br /><br />Not to sound too negative though, because I did enjoy it. Admittedly, I felt like the film was too political at first. I just couldn't appreciate its strong anti-Iraqi War message. It's obviously propaganda, but my struggle was accepting that this was a fictional point of view. The reason why it was a struggle is because of how uncertain we, as American citizens, are in regards to what all is true, and what's false, in regards to the events of 9/11 and the War on Terror. Don't get me wrong. I'm in no way a supporter of the war or certain decisions that were made by Bush's administration, but I wouldn't be so quick to jump on the bandwagon and make accusations like this film seems to. Considering the simple fact that Green Zone is a fictitious story, I opened my mind and enjoyed it for what it is. It's a bold political thriller that's not afraid to tell a controversial story, and towards the end it becomes basically an action flick with a long stretch of suspense in the dark, and bullets flying left and right. Green Zone is essentially a hybrid of Body of Lies and The Hurt Locker (if the focus was on Spec Ops, rather than EODs). It actually succeeds for the most part, but like many people's complaints about Avatar, the political message is so overwhelming that it's kind of hard to enjoy the film on any other level. I would still recommend giving it a look.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has a top notch transfer, with reference audio. My biggest complaint are the typical murky dark scenes, which there are a lot of. I love film grain. It gives me a peace of mind that the people who worked on the disc didn't doctor it up to cater to those who have no idea what real film should look like. So needless to say, this movie looked fantastic to me on Blu-ray because it's loaded with grain. Funny thing is, when I first saw it at the theater, it was before I was as into film as I am now, so I too thought it looked pretty bad. Now that I have a better understanding, I get the whole gritty feel Grengrass intended. That doesn't take away from the fact that heavy grain hurts dark scenes. So in this case, the nighttime scenes may look blurry to some, but there should really be no problem making out details. Now on a DVD, that would be another story, but on Blu-ray, I think they look fine. The sound is sure to rock a house or two. Sound effects are perfectly scattered throughout the battlefield when bullets are flying and bombs are going off. There's a helicopter crash in the third act that sums it all upquite well. The extras are nothing to write home about, but we do get a nice commentary that can be listened to like the average track, or watched as a Picture-in-Picture. There are also a couple of sub-10 minute featurettes that briefly adress Damon and Greengrass's connection to the subject matter, as well as a few soldiers talking about the experience being in the film, and acting alongside Matt Damon. I think most people would love Green Zone, but I happen to fall closer to the middle. I definitely recommend the Blu-ray though.<br /><br />6.5/10quite well.

B002ZG98J6|3.0|What a surprise. Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief was not as bad as I thought it would be. Of course the big comparison has been made a thousand times, and while it's certainly no Harry Potter, I don't think it doesn't matters in the slightest. The first two harry Potter films happen to share the same director, Chris Columbus. I have to admit that this movie was surprisingly entertaining. The effects were top notch, and the actors weren't so bad either. Sure, there were a few spots where dialogue was a little shoddy, which would make any actor look bad delivering it, but overall, I thought they were good. As Brandon T. Jackson's performance was probably my favorite, because he was so tongue-in-cheek that it's impossible to take his character seriously. That sounds bad, but I mean it in a good way. It's nice to see him in another worthwhile role (in my opinion anyway), after his last substantial role being in one of my all-time favorite comedies, Tropic Thunder. He made me laugh a couple times, like near the beginning when Percy (played by Logan Lerman) frantically asked him if he was half donkey, then he replied, \\"I'm half goat.\\" It's hard to explain, but his expression just worked perfectly for me. Speaking of our lead, Logan Lerman, he was actually pretty good as well. He's probably best known for his role in 3:10 To Yuma, and that's still his best. Not to take anything away from his performance here.<br /><br />I hate to say this, but I'm surprised to see Uma Thurman as Medusa in this movie. Not because I think that she's too good for the part, but because her screentime was very short. It was just long enough to not be a cameo, but too short to say she's a star. Even so, she played a pretty essential part throughout the rest of the story, including a mid-credits stinger. I was also surprised to see Pierce Brosnan, Rosario Dawson and Steve Coogan, all of which are actors that I enjoy watching. They all seemed to have fun with their roles, and in a film like this, that helps a lot. If the actors take their roles too seriously, it'll come off as hokey, or corny. When you can tell that the cast obviously had fun making the film, then it allows you to lighten up and have fun watching them \\"work\\". Not sure if the following is really a spoiler, but in case it is, you've been warned. Pierce Brosnan plays a minotaur who is seemingly the only instructor in a camp for the young demigods. I thought that was kind of odd, considering there was a lot of students in that camp, but it wasn't too distracting. Steve Coogan played Hades, and he played him with a rockeresque persona. In his actual \\"Hades form\\", he's quite menacing, but as himself, not so much. I should say though, it did fit, oddly enough. Rosario Dawson played Persephone, the daughter of Zeus (Sean Bean), who was abducted by Hades, and is now the queen of the Underworld. I rather enjoyed their love-hate relationship (mostly hate).<br /><br />Overall, I thought the action was well choreographed, and accompanied by some gorgeous CGI, and some questionable CGI. Of course it's not perfect, or completely convincing, but it's still looks pretty good nonetheless. But in all honesty, how likely is it that even the best looking centaur or dragon would convince the audience? We know these are mythical creatures, so their believability is shot from the start. As for the action itself, the best in the film came when the three main characters, Percy, Grover and Annabeth, were fighting hand-to-hand. Yeah, the budget-focused CGI battles were good, but I'm a stickler for hand-to-hand combat. I thought it was a little brutal for a PG film, and I liked that. The transfer was truly amazing as well. I honestly cannot complain too much about it. There were a number of nighttime scenes, and usually those scenes lose detail and become a bit murky, but that wasn't the case here. I was always able to clearly decipher everything in dark shots. The audio was damn good too. It's still pretty much reference quality. I would definitely recommend this movie to kids (all ages) who aren't too \\"cool\\", in the South Park and FPS age, to enjoy cheesy fantasy films. For older adults, maybe not so much. I am actually looking to a sequel. There are lots movies that don't deserve them, but sequels get made anyway. Percy Jackson and the Olympians is one that does deserve it.<br /><br />6.5/10l pretty much reference quality.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|Iron Man was a huge surprise. And a very pleasant one at that. Going into the summer of 2008, my attention was completely preoccupied with The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk, Kung Fu Panda, Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder, Indiana Jones 4, Wanted, Hellboy II, Wall-E, Step Brothers and The Mummy 3. All of which were very hyped up titles that had people lining up for them. But, among them was one of the best comic book movies ever made. As much as I love The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder (they're in my top three favorite all-time movies), I think that Iron Man is superior to both of them in some ways. It is highly entertaining all the way through. It doesn't matter if you like Superheroes, or not. There is something in this film for just about everyone. The few action scenes are top notch. My personal favorite is the scene when Iron Man returns to the Middle East to destroy all of his weapons. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr. was beyond perfect as Tony Stark. I am always glad to see A-listers give their all in these types of films because it proves that they are not just for children and geeks (honestly, we all still have a little of both in us). The rest of the amazing cast consists of Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and even Samuel L. Jackson in a surprise post-credits cameo. I also have to mention the director, Jon Favreau. I only knew him from comedies and tv, but he did a great job with this big blockbuster.<br /><br />Despite the great action, direction , and superb casting, the real key to this movie's excellence is the script. The writing is not quite as deep and dark as The Dark Knight, but for a supposedly \\"summer popcorn action flick\\", it is right on par. It never hurts to get a team of actual comic book writers along with the creator himself, Stan The Man, to guide you and tell you what fits, and what doesn't. That is the only way to make a comic book character come to life, just as he is on the pages. And in the end it will always pay off with the most important group in the audience, the fans. I cannot say that without admitting something though. I was never an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, although he does make an appearance in alot of my books. But I am very familiar with the character, not only from my comics that he is in, but also the cartoon from the 90's. I still try to catch episodes of the cartoon to this day. The reason I never got into his comic arc is because, I honestly had no interest in the villains he fought, except for the Hulk. Most of his villains were just big robots and monsters (Godzilla was actually one of them). With that said, I was still happy to see that they chose a very conventional first villain, Iron Monger. As long as they never make a movie with M.O.D.O.K., I will be happy.<br /><br />My only complaint about this movie is how scarce the action is. There are only really three scenes of action in total. I know it may seem a little hypocritical for me to complain about the action in Iron Man and give it a 90%, when I gave The Dark Knight 100%, and it had even less action than Iron Man. But the difference between the two is that Iron Man is an action movie, but in my opinion, The Dark Knight is a drama. Alot of people would probably disagree with that statement, but after watching both films many many times, that's the feeling I get about them. The action scenes that it does have are beautiful though. I just think Jon Favreau is not an action director, so he played it safe. In the end, that may have been why Iron Man was so great. I was just really surprised that Iron Man became one of my favorite movies. It reminds me of how I felt about Star Trek. I had my doubts, but those doubts were completely shattered after seeing it.<br /><br />I'll keep this very short because I cannot pretend to be a pro. As far as I can tell, the Picture Quality is reference material through and through. Grain is persistent thoughout, but that only means that they didn't scrub this beautiful transfer clean (which would have taken details away along with the grain). The beautiful effects by ILM are on full display, and i saw no obvious flaws. The same can be said for the audio too. I'm working with a very modest Home Theatre, but I can tell the difference between a good and poor soundtrack. I couldn't hear any apparent flaws. Fine work. As far as the Special Features fo, I loved them. Plain and simple. I just wish there was a damn audio commentary. Commentaries are essential to me, and I cannot help but dock the extras a whole point for there not being one. The one that Favreau did for Iron Man 2 was exactly what we want in a commentary, so it was a missed opportunity. Otherwise, the extras were brilliant.<br /><br />8.5/10crub this beautiful transfer clean (which would have taken details away along with the grain).

B0050PYNO4|5.0|I feel like Paul has gotten a bad rap. It coasted in and out of theaters, under the radar, and even now on Blu-ray, not many people are talking about it. It was very well advertised, but the continuous ads didn't seem to get the job done. I've heard quite a few times that it's not as good as Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's other two films, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, due simply to the lack of director Edgar Wright. That may not necessarily be true. I'm a huge fan of all three of those guys. I love, and own, both Shaun and Fuzz (as well as other films in their filmography), but I'll go out on a limb and say that I think Paul has slightly more rewatchability than both. I know that I'm in the vast minority, but it's just my opinion. It's not quite as all around solid as the other two, but I like it just as much, if not more. And let's be fair, Pegg and Frost wrote it with the same geeky appreciation that they wrote the other two. So it's along the same lines. Edgar Wright is a magnificent director, but his lack of presence did not hurt this film as much as it has been made out.<br /><br />Greg Mottola has made a couple of my favorite teen films, Superbad and Adventureland, so I was happy to see him work with Pegg and Frost. From what I saw in the extras, they were all happy to work with each other as well, but I guess that doesn't say much. What I liked most about Mottola's other films, Superbad and Adventureland, was the Indie feeling that they had. Paul has the same feeling. It has a meek subtlety within the character interactions that contrasts with the kick ass action set pieces, that are very well filmed by the way. I'm also a huge Science Fiction geek, not to mention a Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jason Bateman and Bill Hader fan. Sigourney Weaver also lends herself to a great cameo, which may have a bit of heavy handed dialog, but still works. So needless to say, this one was more than up my alley. I'm both proud, and ashamed to admit that I got every reference in the movie. The homages, or rip-offs, depending on who you ask, are endless.<br /><br />Everything from the regulars, like Star Wars and Star Trek, to the more obscure Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 2001: A Space Odyssey are referred to throughout the course of Paul. Even Indiana Jones, The Lord of the Rings, and a couple other non-Sci-fi flicks get brief winks. But this is essentially an homage to 70-80's Steven Spielberg. As for the characters, they drove it home for me. Of course Simon Pegg and Nick Frost brought their usual charm and comedic timing. Seth Rogen was also his usual persona. Let's just say that Paul is like E.T.'s bad older friend from down the street. He's rude, crude, and obnoxious, but this time around, his character is given a sense of heart amidst the vulgarity and foul language. He really grew on me throughout the course of the film. Not to mention, this is the best, and most slim he's ever going to look. So all you who couldn't fathom him being a crime fighter, or the lucky guy who had a one-nighter with Katherine Heigl, take comfort in the fact that he's not that repulsingly ugly in this one.<br /><br />Everyone was good, but the real show-stealer (or show-thief?) was Kristen Wiig. She was funny all the way through, and Bill Hader was a treat as well. Wiig and Hader are the only reasons I still muster up the strength to watch SNL these days, now that Will Forte is no longer on. It's really a shame that they had so little confidence in this movie that they went and spoiled the cameos by Jane Lynch and Sigourney Weaver in the trailers. Actually, they spoil the cameos in just about every movie nowadays, so confidence probably had nothing to do with it. It bothers me, but I guess that's what puts butts in seats. The transfer is yet another top notch release by Universal. I'm no expert, but detail, colors and everything along those lines was great. It's not quite perfect, but I have no major complaints, and the audio kicks ass as well. I know that's not much of a critique, but like I said, it's top notch. The extras are pretty good as well. There is a fun Making Of featurette (about 40 minutes), as well as a collection of smaller featurettes (around 63 minutes), in addition to a commentary, blooper reel, and other unimportant suppliments. All in all, Paul is a fun little heartfelt comedy, and a solid Blu-ray release.

B0012GVKW8|4.0|I have to start off this review with a confession. I had only seen the original Predator one (yes one) time prior to picking up this Blu-ray. Now that I've seen it a second time, I can honestly say it's one of my favorite alien films, period. For starters, the environmentalists must have thrown a fit over this one. I never thought that watching lush South American jungles and foliage get blow to hell would be so beautiful. This is not supposed to be a beautiful movie (aesthetically), but it was beautiful to me in a visceral sense. Not only in appearance, but in other ways as well. The direction is brilliant. John McTiernan (who also brought us half of the Die Hard series, as well as other highly regarded action films) did one hell of a job directing the pretty much all male cast. The third, and final, act is a strategic cat and mouse game that ends in sheer excitement, and wonderful fireworks. The action is in top form. For a film over a decade old, it still holds up pretty well against today's sorry excuses for action movies. It seems like too many of today's action movies are filled with \\"a bunch of slack-jawed f*****s.\\"<br /><br />Predator proves that action movies, not only can, but are supposed to be intelligent. There is supposed to be a method to the madness. This movie is the definition of a man's movie. Dirt, grime, blood, sweat, and whatever else you can think of. There all here. I loved how they had one man to track (either ironically, or stereotypically, it was a Native American), one man with a mean monster-sized Gatling gun, and the leader who was actually fit to lead. Did he have to be a foreigner though? How can a foreigner lead an elite squad of American soldiers? Honestly, Arnold did so well that I didn't care. Yes, I admit it. Arnold Schwarzenegger actually impressed me with his acting abilities, albeit slightly. That is the first, and last time I will ever say that. Technically, I didn't even say it. So I don't have to look anyone in the face when those words come out my mouth. He and his supporting cast were believable in their roles, but their cliche characters weren't difficult roles to play anyway. It's not as simple to portray realistic soldiers some may think, so I give them credit for doing believable jobs. The future Apollo Creed, Carl Weathers did a noteworthy job, as well as my favorite performance, Bill Duke as Mac. I should also say that they have two of the best death scenes in the film.<br /><br />The acting was all it should be in this film, but not spectacular. The acting is usually what's lacking the most in action movies (not always, but too often), so needless to say, you shouldn't watch these kinds of movies for Oscar caliber performances. I also enjoyed the music a lot. The score brought out the suspense of creeping through the jungle uncertain of what's waiting for you in the trees. It really gave me goosebumps once or twice. The story is pretty familiar ground as far as narrative goes, but I'll give it credit for being over twenty years old. It certainly has inspired many films, and has left us with a few very memorable moments and quotes. My favorite quote was not the most famous (\\"Run, go, get to the chopper!\\"). My favorite quote was in the helicopter ride to the jungle when Duke said \\"Bunch of slack-jawed f*****s around here. This stuff will make you a goddamned sexual Tyrannosaurus, just like me.\\" That line was just hilarious to me. There are a few missteps, but much more is done right to the point of overshadowing the negative. The action, the humor, the suspense. There's much to enjoy about this movie. Plus it ends with a villainous laugh, followed by a patriotic tune as the lead star poses in victory. It's a must see.<br /><br />Note: As far as fidelity to the director's intentions go, the 2008 release of Predator is leaps and bound above the DNR'd mess that is the Ultimate Hunter Edition. If you're someone who prefers your movies to look bright and waxy like new plastic, thenthis release isn't for you, but if you understand the nature of film grain, contrast, etc, then maybe you'll get more out of this release.this release isn't for you, but if you understand the nature of film grain, contrast, etc, then maybe you'll get more out of this release.
B0058A119G|4.0|I have to get used to the fact that Barbra Streisand in now in her sixties and will never sound like she did years ago. I keep waiting for the high notes but these songs are soft and easy, not the old Barbra who could belt out songs like no one else. The music is still good-I always enjoy listening to her, it's just different. We all get older and don't have the strength we once had-apparently that applies to the voice also. One CD, however, seems to be a collection of songs previously done by her and that show her vocal talent of the past. Nonetheless, Barbra is Barbra-there is no singer that comes close to her talent and I will continue to purchase her music just to hear her voice-no matter what her age  is. She is the best!
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I want to start off by saying that all the people who said this movie spent too much time pushing the Avenger Initiative forward, were kind of wrong. I say \\"kind of\\", instead of just plain \\"wrong\\", because, while there are scenes devoted to that agenda, the focus is still definitely Tony Stark and the Iron Man \\"weapon\\". Robert Downey Jr. returns to the role that reinvigorated his career, and he's better than ever. RDJ's portrayal is possibly the most spot-on comic book character that I have seen come to life off of a page. Yes, Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best, but his Tony Stark is a very close second. As for the rest of the performances, they ranged from adequate to great. I never understood why people doubted Don Cheadle replacing Terrence as Rhodey/War Machine from the start. I never did, and he did just what I expected him to. He didn't overact, he didn't steal the show (although I doubt that's possible when your co-start is RDJ), and his voice fit the commanding character that I felt Rhodey's should have been in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I like Terrence Howard in particular roles, but not as Rhodey. I felt his talent was misplaced. And don't get me started on Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Yeah, she's triple covert, and oh my god. That's all I need to say. (wipes drool from mouth). Gwyneth Paltrow returns from the first film, and she's just as quirky. She and RDJ play off of each other very well. That's definitely a dynamic that I enjoy revisiting these films to see.<br /><br />Now Sam Jackson just so happens to be my favorite actor, due to his natural cool guy persona. Him being in this universe is enough for me to be giddy about, yet alone playing such a pivotal role in the Avengers Initiative. While he didn't have a lot of screen time as Nick Fury, I still feel like he still did a great job at capturing the character from Mark Millar's The Ultimates. Ironically, Millar's updated, black Nick Fury was based on Sam Jackson's likeness before he even knew. I feel like I would be doing this guy a disservice if I didn't at least mention Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson. He has actually grown on me as a character after seeing him in almost every film in the quasi-series. Now for the villains. I love Iron Man, and Jeff Bridges. While I thought he made a great corporate villain, something about him being inside of the Iron Monger suit rubbed me the wrong way. I just never really believed it, but it got the job done. Fast forward to Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. Rockwell's Justin Hammer was played more for humor, and the jokes often fell flat. He was still a little funny, and I probably wouldn't be able to chose anyone else for his roles but he just didn't serve as the comic relief that he was intended to be. He reminded me of a skinny version of Austin Powers, except he couldn't fight. That's probably not much of an insult coming from me, because I'm skinny, but I'd like to think I can defend myself. It's not even as if the film needed any more comic relief. Tony Stark was the funniest one in it, and his interactions with Pepper, and Rhodey, have enough to supply the laughs. I was waiting to see Hammer get his due because I loved his character, but that didn't happen in this movie. Perhaps he'll be one of the villains again in the third installment.<br /><br />Now for the main villain, played by Mickey Rourke. Rourke rounds out the all-star cast as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, if that's what you want to call him. Don't get me wrong, he was Whiplash, in essence, but if you've never picked up an Iron Man comic before (or watched the cartoon from the 90's), you'd only know him as Ivan Vanko. He was a more fearsome adversary than Jeff Bridges as Iron Monger. His badassedness was not displayed quite as much as I had hoped, but you still got the message that he was not to be messed with, a few times. I genuinely felt for his character at first, because his father didn't deserve to live, anddie, the way he was forced to, after working with Howard Stark to design the very arc reactor that powered the Iron Man suit, and kept Tony alive. It was his choice of handling that situation that drives you to loathe him. Rourke played him a bit cartooney, but he still did a fine job, even if you can't always understand the Russian accent. Sadly, his final showdown with War Machine and Iron Man is so short that you will miss it if you blink. To be fair, the finale in Iron Man 2 still pissed on the finale in the first one. My only complaint about Iron Man is the lack of a decent final fight. That rooftop/street showdown was very anticlimactic, so I was looking forward to Jon Favreau upping the ante for the sequel. He definitely did, and it wreaks havoc on your sound system. Wow. Window shattering, neighbor waking stuff. Even though I said that the movie did not spend too much time pushing the Avengers into existence, it was still very there. Front and center, to be honest, but never overbearing, like it has been made out to be. There were a few nicely placed little easter eggs that very clearly winked at us fans of the Marvel Universe.<br /><br />One golden nugget (or red, white, and blue, to be exact) actually made me laugh with excitement for what has now become my second favorite Marvel Studios production, after the first Iron Man. That would be Captain America: The First Avenger. Overall, the film was pretty funny. More humorous than anything else, but that's not to say that the action was not impressive. It was definitely good stuff, but this movie still didn't meet my expectations, as far as the hype that was built around it. It's surprising that this all-star cast could not elevate this sequel about its predecessor. I would rank it on the lower side of Marvel Studios' filmography, but still fairly high in comparison to your average comic book movies. My ranking thus far (pre-Avengers) is: (1) Iron Man, (2) Captain America: The First Avenger, (3) The Incredible Hulk (which really needs a sequel, by the way, whether it be with Ruffalo or Norton -- obviously Ruffalo), (4) Iron Man 2, and (5) Thor (don't let me ranking it last fool you, I really like it). Anyway, back to the film at hand. I probably loved this movie more than the average moviegoer, or film enthusiast, due to me being such a huge comic geek, and Marvel fan. But nevertheless, this is a good movie. If you were to separate it from the first film, it probably wouldn't hold up quite as well, but it would still be good. I've defended this movie from the claims that it's just an Avengers preview throughout this review, and I stand by that, but to be honest, had Favreau chosen not to put as many Avengers easter eggs and set-ups in it, it would probably stand on its own merit better. So to wrap this up, I liked it less than the original, but I still highly recommend it to fans of the Marvel U, or comic book flicks in general.

B005OCHOZS|5.0|I'm already a Jurek fan so I knew I'd like it. But I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. Wonderful story. To an outsider, great athletes always seem so above it all. He's ridiculously honest. You see the man behind the legend. Loved this book. Also, tried the pizza recipe and loved it. Others sound good too!
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I think \\"The God of Thunder\\" would have been an awesome title for this film. It's more artistic, in my opinion. Anyway, that's not important. My sentiments on the film are as follows. First of all, Thor is very nice to look at (the movie, not the actor...or maybe they both are, but not to me). In other words, the special effects and cinematography are obviously the work of people who knew what they wanted, and how to achieve it. What they created is a unique vision, that separates itself from the pack, and decides to take a chance on some things. Perhaps the overuse of Dutch Angles will get to some people, but that didn't bother me. I was most annoyed at how frequently that one 7-Eleven showed up in the background. A little product placement doesn't bother me, but come on. Nevertheless, it's exciting to watch, and a delight to see. Asgard has to be one of the most beautiful sights that I have seen in quite a while, and it came to life brilliantly thanks to the fantastic transfer. Colors pop, and the image remains sharp throughout the lighter scenes. Obviously, more detail will be visible with more light. In fact, the only problems in the transfer can be blamed on darker scenes. I've come to expect dark scenes in films to look murky, and sometimes soft. This one is no exception. Unfortunately, there is a good amount of dark scenes, with important things to see in them at that. Thor has damn good picture quality, that's near reference, despite its shortcomings.<br /><br />Director Kenneth Brannaugh has brought his Shakesperian background to the Marvel Universe, and what he created is an epic story that spans three worlds, with a very strong and tragic family dynamic, as well as a few moderately underwhelming action scenes. The first set piece in Jotunheim (the Frost Giant realm) is fantastic, albeit a tad dark. I didn't mind the darkness, because it was a snowy terrain, but I wanted to see the great make-up work they did on the Giants. I also enjoyed Thor's bout with his brother, Loki, as well as Heimdall fighting the two Frost Giants for a brief second, as well as Thor infiltrating the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound. You're probably think, \\"well what else is left?\\" I guess the reason I felt the action was lacking overall is because the fight I was most anticipating, besides the iconic Thor vs. Loki, turned out to be the weakest in the film. That would be Thor, The Warriors Three and Lady Sif vs. The Destroyer. But anyway, the same thing that happened with both of the Iron Man films, happened here. The same could probably be said for Captain America. The ongoing trend with the films in the Avengers series is well fleshed out, and acted, characters that have many good moments to show their personalities (strengths and weaknesses), surrounded by a well-rounded cast, but lacking in the kick-ass action department (with the exception of The Incredible Hulk). Don't get me wrong, it's still never dull, and the flawless 7.1 audio is sure to rattle a window or two.<br /><br />The humor in this film surprised me as well. From the trailers, it seemed like Kat Dennings was going to provide a few lame attempts to squeeze a chuckle or two out of the audience. To my surprise, I laughed at pretty much all of the intended jokes. I have to admit, I even found myself enjoying the film more on Blu-ray than I did in theaters. I can't quite say why, but I did. To my surprise, the two strongest parts of the movie were the least known, and probably most questionable selections of the producers. I'm talking about the two lead actors. Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, and Tom Hiddleston, who plays Loki. Hemsworth has the look, obviously. He looks like he was pulled right off of the page. This may just be the role he was born to play. He was probably only known for his brief scene in Star Trek prior to this, if that. His role was pivotal, and his performance was great, but he was probably forgotten by many, due to the dynamic cast of that movie. Here he really getshis time to shine, and shine he sure does. Going in, Hiddleston was a complete unknown in my book. I usually prefer actors I recognize to play roles as big as his, but I'm surprised to say I loved him. His performance really gets to you. He's playing the main villain, but not once did I root against him. You really feel bad for Loki as the story unfolds, and Hiddleston couldn't have been better at conveying that heartbreak, and sorrow. So if you're looking to be dazzled, and for a rich, Shakesperian family drama, Thor is highly recommended. It's definitely a must own for Marvel fans, and fans of the comics.<br /><br />7/10his time to shine, and shine he sure does. Going in, Hiddleston was a complete unknown in my book.

B003Y5H542|5.0|Where to begin with Rango? I intentionally avoided it when it was in theaters for no good reason, other than the fact that I knew I would buy it when it came out on Blu-ray, and I figured I would save myself some money since I was not dying to see it. In some ways that may have contributed to me loving the film so much after only a couple of viewings. It's definitely my new favorite Western, as hard as that may be to believe. Rango takes many aspects from classic Westerns and reiterates them through fresh, and often funny ways. I'll briefly summarize the plot. The story revolves around a pet chameleon (voiced by Johnny Depp at the top of his game) who becomes stranded in the Mojave Desert after his terrarium is thrown from his owner's car. After meeting an armadillo named Roadkill (voiced by Alfred Molina), who is seeking the mystical Spirit of the West, he narrowly avoids being eaten by a hawk before meeting another lizard, named Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher). Beans then takes Rango to Dirt, a small, Old West town populated by a colorful cast of various species of desert animals (watch the \\"Real Creatures of Dirt\\" featurette in the extras to see their real-life counterparts), whom each has their own different personality, look, and shall I say, walk? That's a joke that ties into an early gag when Rango first arrives at Dirt. There is quite a bit of quirky, offbeat humor throughout, and that caught me off guard. I had a lot of fun watching this movie. More so than I expected to. I have to say, this may just be the most gorgeously animated film that I have ever seen.<br /><br />It's my dream to be an animator and a visual effects artist after I finish college, and to witness the magnificent work on display in this film was a real treat. This may be controversial because Pixar is backed by legions of fans (myself included), but honestly, if ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) worked on more animated films, they would dominate the industry. It's quite funny to me that the very same visual effects house (founded by none other than George Lucas) that gave us Pixar, arguably the best in the business at what they do (which is the whole package of story and animation, not just animation), has made one of the few films that I think looks more visually arresting than anything they have done. It's also ironic that this film is so beautiful, because it has the ugliest cast of characters that I have ever seen in an animated film. Not only the characters, but the scenery has a rugged beauty as well. In the town, Dirt, Gore Verbinski (Director) said that he didn't want any parallel lines or 90 degree angles. He wanted it to show that this ugly little town was not made by expert craftsmen. It was made by animals. It's so incredibly rich and detailed that it's hard not to ogle at it. There are some very well-done action sequences in this film, and I must say that the bat scene is not to be missed. It's quite obvious that this movie is not aiming its focus at little children, in more ways than one. The director himself said so on the commentary, but before I listened to that, I thought that. First of all, as I already mentioned, these characters are not visually appealing, so they probably won't want a plush doll of any of them, except for maybe Rango. He literally is the only character in the film with some color.<br /><br />Another reason why I felt this film was not aiming itself at children was the writing itself. There are so many big words throughout this film that even some older kids and adults will have to look them up. Definitely a few lines that parents will have to explain to their kids later. I can hear it now. \\"Mommy, what's a prostate?\\" \\"Oh, um, I'll tell you in a few years...\\" \\"Okay, but what about a mammogram?\\" \\"Oh dear God, this is supposed to be a cartoon.\\" And that's where the parent would be wrong. If ever there was a perfect example that not all animated films are for little children, Rango would be it. In one of the bonus features, Verbinski said a quote that I have said a few times, so it really stood out to me. He said, \\"Animation is not a genre. It's a technique to tell a story.\\" I wish more people would understand this, because it's disappointing when someone won't even give an animated film a chance because they think it's for little kids. On another note, film buffs should, especially Western buffs, should have a ball looking for all of the references to other films, none of which a kid would catch (wink, wink). I definitely couldn't catch them all, so I looked them up. I'll name the ones I found (without spoiling what parts they appear in). There are references to: The Man With No Name Trilogy (referenced quite a few times, in various ways), John Wayne cowboy films in general, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Chinatown, Cat Ballou, High Noon, The Shakiest Gun in the West, Apocalypse Now, Pirates of the Caribbean, Aliens. As you can see, there are plenty to look for, and that probably isn't all of them. Rango is exciting, charming, funny, and fresh. I will definitely be returning to it many times in the coming years.<br /><br />There is no reason to go into great detail here. The movie has enough detail to the point where the animators could probably have taken out a bit of the various textures and fine details, and the movie would probably still be ahead of its competition. The picture quality is simply flawless (no exaggeration). If there was a level above perfection, Rango would be there. I've already said enough about how beautiful and detailed the animations are, and the transfer brings it life very, very well. I'd recommend this Blu-ray just as a reference to show off to friends and family who still buy DVDs. I'd be willing to bet my left nut that it would convert at least one of them. Rescue one of them from the Dark Side. All kidding aside, it truly is a sight to behold. I also want to commend the creators for not succumbing to the 3D craze, and filming Rango in 3D. Even though we always have a choice as to whether or not we want to watch a film in the format, and I pretty much always choose to watch animated films in 3D (so forgive my hypocrisy), it's undeniable that filmmakers spend time tinkering with the 3D that they would otherwise have spent on another aspect of the film. So I'm happy that all of their time was spent perfecting other aspects of Rango. As for the audio, it's top notch as well. Admittedly, I don't have the greatest sound system, but I did not notice any glaring flaws with the audio either, so I have to say it's flawless as well. The extras are also pretty damn good. I almost never watch extras right after the film ends, but I did with Rango.<br /><br />I started with the \\"Real Creatures of Dirt\\" featurette. It was actually pretty cool. It was a fairly short (about the length of a half hour TV show with no commercials) and was in the style of the old Zoboomafoo show from PBS, with a Steve Irwin twist (dangerously close, in other words). Next up was the \\"Breaking the Rules: Making Animation History\\" featurette, which was your standard \\"Making of\\" fair. Both were fun to watch, and will definitely strengthen your love for the film if you like it. It was quite interesting to see the creative way they filmed the actors on a sound stage acting out the entire film, then used the footage for reference when doing the animations. It was almost like motion capture, without the tights suits and little dot markers. Johnny Depp is hilarious to watch. His facial expressions really sell his commitment to the character. I also listened to the audio commentary. It was fun to listen to, and while fans will learn a few interesting tidbits here and there, I wouldn't say it's a necessity. So, all in all, Rango is an all-around satisfying film. It's funny and witty, with fresh humor that isn't often found in animated films. It's often exciting with thrilling chases and square-offs (as all great Westerns do). It has gorgeous scenery (some of the most realistic CGI environments that I have ever seen). And most importantly, it should be entertaining for the whole family, but adults should get more out of it than young children, I give Rango my highest recommendation.

And most importantly, it should be entertaining for the whole family, but adults should get more out of it than young children, I give Rango my highest recommendation. MUST OWN.

B002ZG97EC|4.0|In my opinion, Despicable Me is yet another heartfelt, hilarious animated comedy for us to sink our teeth into this year. I thought to myself at the end of the movie that it felt a lot like the live-action version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. So I dubbed it, \\"How The Gru Stole The Moon\\". Anyway, this is a fantastic film, but the cuteness can be a bit much from time to time. I don't think they needed the added \\"aww\\" moments. It's obviously marketed for very young children, but like so many other animated films, there's plenty of material here to keep the adults happy. In the theatre, I laughed out loud in the more at this one, than I have at an animated film in a very long time. After rewatching it at home, it hasn't lost its spark. The voicework is just under terrific. I love Steve Carrell (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, The Office), but at times his fake accent can be a little overdone (especially with all of the sayings). I love Jason Segal (I Love You Man, Forgetting Sarah Marshall) just as much, and his work is actually perfect. His voice fit Vector to perfection. Once more, I love Russell Brand (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him To The Greek) and Kristen Wiig Adventureland, MacGruber), so their voices were a welcome treat. And last, but not least, the minions. Their voices were done by the two directors. As you can see, I had high expectations for this ensemble of hilarious comedians going in. They didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Like I said, Steve Carrell's choice of accent may be annoying sometimes, but it didn't ruin the experience at all. The think this movie had a very good script as well. The dialogue, the pacing, everything was well written. The editing is perfect. It does start off a tiny bit slow, but still not dull. It's funny all the way throughout. The music was great as well. Rapper/Producer/N.E.R.D. lead Pharrell Williams did the music, and it was excellent. Nice mix of a variety of music genres, all toned together perfectly. There are plenty of winning concept in the film. I mentioned that it reminded me of The Grinch, but it was still very creative. It was a lot better than Megamind. And I say that because the two are both told from a villains perspective, so they're bound to be compared. Why are Universal and DreamWorks releasing FOUR movies in the same year anyway? Aren't they still married (corporately, I mean)? I don't know, out if so, I guess they're trying to stay relevant so that Disney doesn't destroy their line-up when Oscar season comes, with Toy Story 3 and Tangled. Sadly, it probably will anyway. I say sadly because I'm one of the few who liked How To Train Your Dragon just a sliver of a tiny tad bit more than Toy Story 3. Back to this movie. There were some things I had a little trouble coping with. The main thing is, and this may sound stupid because it's a cartoon, but I had a little trouble coping with the obvious and complete lack of realism (a stupid nitpick, I admit, but hear me out).<br /><br />This movie felt too much like an episode of The Looney Toons, with sharks eating Gru, and a dozen missiles hitting him in the face, yet he walks away unscathed. It is very much stupid for me to complain about that, because, like I said, it's a cartoon, but it conflicts with the touching emotional tone other scenes try to set. Even so, I think it's a great movie for the whole family. The show stealers by far are the minions. I loved the minions so much. They never ceased to make me smile, crack up, or flat out bust out with laughter. They were awesome. Easily the best thing about the movie, which means a lot. I also liked the little girl, Agnes. She was cute, and actually a strong character. So, I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and everyone. Young or old. Hopefully Despicable Me will not be forgotten in the shadow of Toy Story 3, How To Train Your Dragon, and Tangled, all of which made 2010 an incredible year for Animation. As everyone should expect, the transfer is perfect. At least it is to someone like me, who isn't a video or audiophile (with that being said, I should add that I watch my Blus on a 46\\" Samsung LCD and have a 5.1 receiver connected with four speakers, so I can tell the difference). The picture is as sharp as any of the Pixar or Dreamworks films I own. There really aren't many different textures in this movie. After watching the four Shreks on Blu this week, I have a certain standard of texture variations that I prefer to see in animated films. In the four Shreks you see fur, skin, scales, different clothings, and much more.<br /><br />So with that said, Despicable has a very plain texture palette, which probably won't bother anyone. It didn't really bother me, but I noticed it. Anyway, the colors pop off of the screen, and detail is above par. The audio is equally impressive. There are a lot of mixed sounds that intersect. At any given moment, voices, sound effects and music will all play at the same time. Yet, not once was I unable to decipher any of it. All around, it's a perfect transfer in my book. For my fellow slipcover enthusiasts, there is a healthy option available on the market. As far as extras go, there aren't a whole lot, but what's there is decent enough I guess. Compared to the features on Pixar's library, I cannot bring myself to be too generous with my rating of the extras. There just aren't enough. I love the minions (like I said before), but their three mini movies combined only last a good 8 or 9 minutes (with at least 3 minutes added from the credits). There is a commentary with the directors and the minions. I cannot wait to sit through it on my second viewing. There are the above mentioned three minion mini movies (Orientation Day, Home Makeover and Banana). There is a 16 minute documentary on the voice talent of the film (The Voices of Despicable Me), a 15 minute documentary on the story (The World of Despicable Me), as well as a 3 minute clip of the composer, Pharrell Williams, and his music (Despicable Beats). I really liked the fact that a Hip-Hop/R&B artist did the music, but this clip (I call it a clip because it's too short to be considered a documentary) did not give any useful information. There are also a few games and other activities for kids. It's really a well-rounded package. Definitely a must own for families (or twenty-something-year-old college students like myself).o someone like me, who isn't a video or audiophile (with that being said, I should add that I watch my Blus on a 46\\" Samsung LCD and have a 5.1 receiver connected with four speakers, so I can tell the difference).

B001DHXT1G|4.0|Just watched The Incredible Hulk again, for the umpteenth time, and I have to say. It seems to get better every time I watch it. I am a huge fan of the character, but Ang Lee's Hulk did not do him the justice he deserved, in my opinion. Besides the fact that it was kind of long and boring, I just felt like there wasn't anything of value in that movie to retain my interest. For this one, it really made me happy to see such a devoted team work to bring fans the movie they deserved. It also made me happy to see that it was more of a continuation of where Hulk (2003) left off in the South American jungle, rather than a standard reboot. Ed Norton is to this film, what Ryan Reynolds will be to the Deadpool spin-off. He actually cared about the character, and had previous knowledge of who Bruce Banner and the Hulk were. That is always better than an actor who has to play catch up before shooting begins. I love Ed Norton, so I hope he returns for a second, and makes an appearance in The Avengers. I know the studio had his script rewritten and pissed him off, but hopefully they will work all of that out. Another huge plus this movie had going for it was Tim Roth as the villain. He was fantastic in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. And say what you want about Planet of the Apes, but he was very convincing as Thade. Another thing I really like about The Incredible Hulk is how tightly edited it is. The cinematography is beatiful, and the editors did a great job at cutting the scenes together. I wish there was a little more film for them to edit though. Nevertheless, it had a consistent flow in the pacing.<br /><br />There was a fair amount of breathtaking action. My favorite action set piece is on the college campus, but the final fight was sick as well. The narrative is definitely the star of this one. It brings joy to my heart that writers are taking comic book movies more serious. I never felt like the story was getting off track, or boring. There's alot of things that I love about this movie, but there are definitely a few flaws. The biggest flaw would have to be Liv Tyler's phoned in performance. Is it just me, or is she overrated? Her performance in The Lord of the Rings was pretty good, but how hard was that role? Another problem I had was that there was not enough character development for the Hulk, himself. Sure Bruce Banner was well developed, but what about the Hulk? In the comics and cartoons he held full conversations, but in the live action movies he can only utter two or three words. It gives viewers the false impression that he is all smash and scream, with no real thought process, except to protect Betty. I also felt that there wasn't enough variety. To me the movie went by too quickly. Is that a bad thing? I don't know, but I like this movie alot. Especially because the character is special to me. Of course this movie is no Iron Man or Spider-man, but it was a nice addition to my library of comic book films. In the mean time, I will keep impatiently waiting for the next installment. Even if the studio pissed Ed Norton off, I still hope he can get over that before a sequel for this movie becomes obsolete. Actually a sequel will never become obsolete because I love the Hulk.<br /><br />Now for the BD's transfer. The Incredible Hulk has a just about pristine transfer. The picture was fantastic, albeit minorly flawed. There were not enough issues with the PQ for me to dock the transfer any points. The audio is perfection. Loud, bombastic, and it just abuses the Home Theatre. You want to wake your neighbors? Put on the scene where we see Bruce change into the not-so-jolly green giant for the first time. When he lets out the bellowing roar, my windows rattled. There's nothing else I can say about it. It's pure demo material. The Incredible Hulk stands alone as the only Blu-ray available in both a green Elite case and lenticular slipcover. The packaging is all a geek can dream of. I love it. The extras are very well done. I enjoyed the featurettes, but I really wish the \\"making of\\" was longer. Hey, a half hour is better than some half-assed little interview right? Also, I was disappointed that Ed Norton didn't take the time to input his opinions in the otherwise engaging and entertaining audio commentary.<br /><br />7.5/10yed the featurettes, but I really wish the \\"making of\\" was longer.

0385340575|4.0|Gone Tomorrow, by Lee Child is another in the Reacher series.  It starts on a train, and as in all Childs works, you learn a lot of interesting things about New York trains.  You also learn about the twelve deadly signs that give away suicide bombers.  Reacher, being Reacher is always more about being safe than sorry, but this time it is a suicide and not a suicide bomber he's dealing with and his mistake is what leads him into dealing with the real thing.  What I like about Reacher stories is they are all very different from each other, but Reacher is always Reacher.  He does things because he feels they are the right thing to do and usually isn't haunted by any second thoughts.  This story is a little different in that Reacher feels he might not have handled things in the best way possible and he finds himself dodging police, FBI, a gang of private security and a fairly large group of Afghan terrorists.  He's hopping trains and running everybody in circles as he slowly closes in and eliminates the bad guys.  Like all Reacher stories, it's very hard to put down once started and once finished you feel like you were right there watching Reacher work things out his own way.  Definately a must read for those who love crime and thrillers.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. The Dark Knight is still my all-time favorite film, and I think that it is better, but this is HIS masterpiece. He managed to create his own personal intellectual property, not based on any previous work. Since Batman has thousands of comics to build a great film around, it took a lot less to bring The Dark Knight to life, than it did to create Inception. He easily outdid himself with this one. Everyone is going to talk about how smart the movie is. How it requires your full attention, and so on. I'm not going to beat a dead horse. Yes, the movie is brilliant. Yes, you do have to use your brain to enjoy it. There's not a hundred explosions and acrobatic stunts to keep today's action fans excited, but fans of every genre should find something here. The concept of entering another persons mind is such a brilliant thing to work with. The only other movie I can remember like that was The Cell. That film has absolutely nothing on this one. Ten years in the making, this is a movie that everyone and their grandmother should go to the theatre, pay whatever for the tickets, and let your minds get blown. I hate to be a fanboy, but it's so hard not to fall in love with a film that obviously, the creators took their sweet time with. The attention to detail is something of beauty. We don't get enough art in our modern films. Most blockbusters are dumb fun, and not much more. Chris Nolan consistently breaks that stigma, and defies what we've come to expect from Summer blockbusters. He always knows how to cast his films perfectly too.<br /><br />The acting is great, in my opinion. Not everyone was perfect, but everyone was very believable. Leo DiCaprio is creeping his way into my favorite actors list. He is today's 1970s Robert De Niro. Ellen Page is always great, and she's no different here. Joseph Gordon-Levitt...seriously. Does anyone not like him? No offense, but if you don't like Joseph Gordon-Levitt something is wrong with you. He's not an up and comer anymore. He's officially a big deal. Get used to that face, and get ready to up his paycheck Hollywood. Michael Caine is one of my favorites, so I'm not going to linger on him. I love everything he does. Tom Hardy is great as well. I only knew him from RocknRolla, but he was great there too. Ken Watanabe is still Ras Al Ghul in my eyes. I hope he keeps working with Nolan. I can go on and on about the performances. They were just all so great. Since I'm starting to sound like a broken record, talking about the \\"great performances\\", I'll just mention the last few actors, and it's understood that they were fantastic. Okay, so Cillain Murphy, Tom Berenger, Dileep Rao, and of course the beautiful Marion Cotillard...all made an impression. There so many facets to this film. The score, by Nolan favorite Hans Zimmer, was phenomenal. I love his music very much. The score is still playing in my head right now. The screenplay was unique, yet still felt very much like a Christopher Nolan story. His movies all feel almost exactly the same. His style is so predictable, yet it never gets old.

B001HN690O|5.0|Where do I begin? For starters, I have to say that Kung Fu Panda 2 (formerly called \\"The Kaboom of Doom\\") outdid its predecessor in every way, in my opinion, except for maybe laughs. And that's saying a mouthful because I love the first film. Kung Fu Panda is one of my favorite animated films, so I was very eagerly awaiting this one's release. I can honestly say I don't mind the lack of big laughs one bit. I never really found the first very funny either. Its humor cater has always catered more to a demographic that's quite a few years behind me anyway. That being said, I still do laugh a few times whenever I pop the first one in, and not so much with the sequel. Nevertheless, genuine heart fills the void that the lack of substantial comedy left behind. Kung Fu Panda 2 has an extra dosage of emotional oomph that many animated films strive for, but rarely achieve. Meaning it leaves a mark on you, making you feel sorry for our lead, Po (Jack Black). After How To Train Your Dragon, I knew DreamWorks was on the right path to eventually being close to, if not on par with Pixar. Don't get me wrong, I love some of the films in their library, but there's an obvious difference between an everlasting classic film and a simply entertaining one. How To Train Your Dragon and Kung Fu Panda 2 have officially allowed DreamWorks to attain the former two years in a row. Now what's a kung fu movie with exciting fight scenes?<br /><br />The kung fu is aplenty in Kung Fu Panda 2, and the sequences are spectacular. Needless to say, the action is thrilling. The choreography is very well done, albeit a little difficult to make out the first couple of times you watch the film. I can confidently say that this is one of my favorite kung fu movies. To be fair, I'm not well versed in the subgenre, so maybe m claim means little. The characters are so natural and believable. Top notch voice work by the entire cast. Jack Black really cares about Po, and it shows. His subtly is sublime. Every little nuance in his voice comes through and clearly translates to create our lovable hero Po. These animation studios are really getting good at facial tweaks, especially the eyes. There's so much soul and life behind the characters' eyes. Besides Jack Black, there is a stellar group of names including: Dustin Hoffman returning as the wise Yoda-like Shifu (even down to the walking stick - Master Oogway's staff) , Angelina Jolie as Tigress the fearless leader of the Furious Five, Seth Rogen as Mantis (showing even more growth in his voice work talent), Lucy Liu as Viper, David Cross as Crane, Jackie Chan as Monkey, and James Hong as Mr. Ping, rounding out the returning support. The newcomers are Gary Oldman playing yet another villain to perfection in Shen, the always funny (but more menacing in this case) Danny McBride as the one-eyed Wolf Boss, Dennis Haysbert as a commanding Master Ox, and the only other kung fu legend in the film besides Chan, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Master Croc.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of animated movies, and as an artist I took note of the various creative ways that the scenes were painted onto the canvas, or screen. One major strength I loved about Kung Fu Panda was how beautifully they used colors and shapes to tell the story. The sequel is no different. The scenery in this movie pops to perfection in each of its different striking art styles. Be it classic and drawn-esque, or state of the art CGI, this movie is simply a beautiful sight to behold. The color palette is darker than the first because the story is darker. This sequel takes our characters down an Empire Strikes Back, Temple of Doom sort of path. These characters that we grew to love in the light-hearted, fun first entries must then go to new lengths - emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually - in the sequels. In this film, Po get tested in ways that I never expected a character as care-free, adventurous, and fun loving to be. Kung Fu Panda 2 revolves around him learning tomaster the ancient art of inner peace, a lesson that doesn't come easily to put it lightly. Simply put, I loved it. Once again, the Hans Zimmer and John Powell's score adds a lot to the visuals, which are amazing. We've come to expect nothing short of the best A/V presentations from animated releases, and I am happy to say that Kung Fu Panda 2 delivers. Truly a top notch release in pretty much every department. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />8.5/10master the ancient art of inner peace, a lesson that doesn't come easily to put it lightly.

1451608659|5.0|As I come to the conclusion of this memoir, I am uplifted that Dominique was able to overcome the hardships in her life and turn them into a positive future endeavor: to advocate and promote for justice in the sport of gymnastics. At the same time I am greatly let down and angered by the injustice in USA gymnastics that Dominique reveals. My view of elite gymnastics, the Karolyi's and the selection procedures have been tainted and as I am watching the competitions leading up to the Olympics, I am questioning everything that I see and hear. Most recently I question the decision of Chelsie Memmel to have not been allowed to compete at Nationals among other decisions that have been made in the last few months.<br /><br />I was very disheartened to learn about the fact that Dominique, as well as other gymnasts, were not \\"truly\\" coached by the Karolyi's, that it was a revolving door and more of a business agreement than a coach and athelete partnership. It made me angry to read that coaches would be \\"let go\\" just prior to an upcoming competition so that Bela and Marta could, supposedly, take the credit. It does make me look at the Karolyi's in a different light adding more confusion and questions.<br /><br />I recently purchased and read Nadia's book \\"Letters to a Young Gymnast,\\" where she very much praises and is almost defensive of Bela. Could it be that the Karolyis \\"changed\\" when beginning their coaching careers in America? Dominique mentions that Nadia was present at her wedding serving as the honorary godmother but does not expand further on their relationship. I would think that their views and feelings of the Karoly's were quite different? In addition, I haven't heard much else, in this profound detail, from other gymnasts coached by Karolyi. Was this experience unique to Dominique because of her Romanian heritage? Are the other gymnasts afraid to speak up?<br /><br />Recently, there has been much praise and attention given to Marta, the Ranch, and the selectionprocess, as if a buffer to prepare for the impending release of this book. The commentators on NBC, covering the competitions, as well as recent articles in \\"Inside Gymnastics\\" magazine, to name a few, have been eager to voice very positive comments in this regard.<br /><br />My heart bled for Dominique as I read that standing on the podium, receiving her gold medal, rather than being truly overjoyed, she was fearful and paranoid about how her parents would react to the fact that she fell on vault. In reading her story I almost felt that Dominique had developed GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and/or paranoia from all the fear, stress and presssure that she faced daily from her parents and coaches in doing something (gymnastics) that she was supposed to love. It is clear, from what she reveals, that she was abused physically and emotionally from the people that she trusted most. All of this just makes her triumph the more sweeter.<br /><br />As I watch the gymnasts who are competing now, I think to myself: are they starving? are they being pushed to hard? Are they truly happy? Are they hurt?<br />I wonder what Nastia Liukin's experience was growing up and being trained by a father who was also raised in the Soviet system and wanted his dreams for his daughter? Were the overbearing expectations and pressures similar to Dominiques?<br /><br />As one can see this memoir raised alot of questions and concerns in my mind but all in all I am thankful to Dominique for writing this book and bringing up issues in USA gymnastics that need to be addressed and dealt with. Although Dominique will have her harsh critics, memoirs like this one and others such as \\"Chalked Up\\" by Jennifer Sey expose the underbelly of USA gymnastics.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, James's repetition of gasp, hot, etc. caused boredom.  Worse, however, was protagonist Anastasia Steele's attitude toward Christian Grey. Adolescent love times two fits the bill. For a 22-year old, her thoughts mirrored those of a middle school girl. Christian is never just refered to by first name but as &#34;Christian Grey,&#34; as in &#34;Christian Grey is in my bed!&#34; Additionally, Ana's naivety is over-the-top in today's society, particularly for a fan of Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Even Victorian Hardy gave some details in his work. Innocent virgin is fine, but not that naive.<br />Even worse than Ana's giddy, immature feelings is her relationship with Christian. Having dated a contrpl freak, I found myself sickened by descriptions of his dominance over Ana. Please note this is not in relation to the red room, but the car, plane ticket, clothes, and food. He will not even call her Ana as she prefers. Ana's acceptance of these turns my stomach as she makes excuses for Christian as many abused women do. James romanticizes an abuse of power, not to mention Christian's &#34;Mrs. Robinson&#34; pedophile. These topics sre disturbing, not sexy.<br />Finally, if you want a quality, sexy thrill, try Anne Rice's erotica. If you like classics, try Henry Miller or Anias Nin. If you enjoy banality, two dimensional characters, repetitive writing, British slang, and abusive relationships, go for Grey.

B0038P59A0|4.0|Time flew by for me as I watched this modern reimagining of my favorite fictional detective. Downey Jr.'s Holmes cuts a darker figure than his canonical predecessor, for example employing his significant physical prowess to a much greater extent and having disturbing Holme's girlfriend the governess to the point she threw her wine on him. Holmes cuts a more impressive figure than he does in the canon, proving slightly sharper mentally and physically than Holme's foil in Conan Doyle's writings. I particularly enjoyed the combat choreography, which depicted Holmes fighting in superb modern style, using both Muay Thai strikes and Brazilian Jiujitsu grappling techniques--the overall effect updates Conan Doyle's boxing Holmes to the fighting system a modern virtuoso would use. Highly recommended.

After treatment (CPAP), I literally feel like a new man.  Then I started going to the gym regularly (now that I had actual energy in the mornings to do so).  But even though I was feeling better with my sleep apnea under control, and better fitness from the gym, I just couldn't lose the tummy flab and craved wheat-based goodies about every two hours (I learned the significance of the two-hour interval from reading the book).<br /><br />After about five weeks (I originally was just going to do a 2-week trial), I feel AWESOME and my tummy flab is starting to melt away (slowly, but I've been adding fat to my stomach for more than 10 years, so I'm just happy it's finally moving in the right direction).  I'm also experiencing way fewer headaches, less need for my asthma inhaler, no more constant cold symptoms, and better mood.  Oh, and I'm rarely hungry between meals nowadays.<br /><br />This book was an eye-opener, but actually FOLLOWING Dr. Davis' suggestions and feeling/seeing the results is the real eye-opener.<br /><br />Wheat -- yes, wheat -- is some nasty, nasty stuff.<br /><br />Thanks doctor!
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I love love love this album. Every song is beautiful, heartful, realistic, and distinctive. Emeli Sande has a very soulful and unique voice. I knew after I heard only one song (Next to Me) that I wanted to buy the album. I am very pleased with my purchase. Don't hesitate to buy it you won't regret it. She really put a lot of thought into this album. Her next one might not top this one. Great job Emeli Sande! I am looking forward to buying  more of your albums.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|loved this game. great graphics, great story and really great puzzles. I played almost nonstop till I finished it. definitely worth it.
0984725113|4.0|Short, high-density Single on the \\"Digital Revolution\\".<br /><br />Pros: lots of insight backed by data and references.<br /><br />Cons: not aware of its own limitations.  A Single is long enough to make and support some useful points, but not long enough to get one's arms all the way around the topic.<br /><br />For example, the authors refer to the Long Tail, a well established feature of digital markets, and point to a countervailing trend: consolidation to superstars.  People don't need as many classical violinists as they used to because the few best ones can reach much larger audiences.  It would be interesting to watch these trends with data from the movie, radio, TV, and Internet eras.  Is it easier or hard to make a living as a musician in 2010<br />than in 1890?<br /><br />It would take a much longer book to explore these areas.  Still, though, I'm happy with this short, intense Single
B007R41E8O|5.0|This game was a good time.. I loved the mini games and puzzles. It also had a good story/plot to it. That's hard to find.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Maybe I got the only defective adapter, but, after a couple of weeks of trying to figure out why I couldn't get the thing to work, I took it to Best Buy and had the Geek Squad Guys look at it.<br /><br />There was no driver inside; therefore, my laptop couldn't even recognize the device.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is awesome and super cool I like the games on it and it is so cool I love it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OMG this is a great book / trilogy. I could not put it down, from the first to the last.I did not know what this was all about but boy was I surprised when I got to reading. I would and have told anyone over the age of 18 to read. If you haven't read these as of yet do so you won't be sorry and your mate will love it too.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is always fun! I can get bored of it!  it is challenging. but not to difficult. I would reccomend this game to everyone
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I hated the first book but the way it ended it sounded like it could get alittle better and since I have never been a person to start a series and not finish it I bought the second one and it sucked!!! The sex scenes never seem to change along with her constant worries about not being good enough for him. Waste of money and time.
1468161660|5.0|I read this book in 1 night. I am 35 years old and could still relate to every aspect of this book. I felt every emotion.  It is worth so much more than the $2.99 I paid for it!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked this up based on a search for highest rated sci-fi in the Kindle Store. Finished it last night at 1AM. Huge Howey has written a great sci-fi series that's worth 10x the cost and I'd certainly have paid more for it, it's a steal on the Kindle platform. Now I need more!!! I saw another Wool related book, that I just purchased, that's set before the story in Wool, but I'm hoping for more, and soon!<br /><br />I was \\"in between\\" authors and looking for someone and something new, extremely happy I stumbled on Huge's series.<br /><br />His characters come to life and you can almost see and feel them as the story progresses. It builds on itself nicely and will leave you pondering some of the decisions that have to be made by various characters, it's not black and white as much as it would appear to be and the farther you read the more you can empathize with each point of view. Very well written and edited, very clear writing style, the last page left me wanting another 500 more.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next installment.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read all of John Green's books, and I enjoy them all thoroughly. I think his voice, while not necessarily the most original, is definitely worth being heard. He always takes on the reality of how tempting pessimism can be, but how important hope is. I do think his narrators, characters, stories, are all relatively the same, though.<br />This book breaks the mold.<br />I can't even write this without crying because reading this book touches a part of our humanity and mortality that we have become accustomed to pushing away. We, as a society, generally spend our time moving through motions of superficiality and vanity. I'm not trying to be self-righteous. It's true.<br />But there are people that are forced to face their mortality every day. Their struggle can be a curse and a blessing. It's so hard to read some of the other books about terminal illnesses. They can be optimistic to the point of being sugary and distorted. Or they can be so morbid that the author seems to be pressing the point that in the end, life is nothing.<br />But John Green balances this book beautifully. Hazel is a profoundly flawed, tragic, and beautiful narrator.<br />I read this book cover to cover the minute I got it. And it made me want to put effort into living my life.<br />Life is not perfect. It is not easy. It is beautiful and precious, though. I know that sounds cliche and ridiculous, but this book will make you feel all of it. It will--like all good books seem to do--make you feel more human.
B000W74EQC|2.0|The disc is defective and does not finish. It will not work after the 2 hour point. We just tried to watch this after purchasing it in December and are very disappointed we didn't do it sooner so we could return it. This is a defective product after it was guaranteed it would work.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I think I wrote a review for this before. It is about a true love that stands the test of time, who knows how much time or neverending. It begins with their meeting as teens till their time of departure. The things I liked, the carnival, holding hands with a girlfriend, laughing, flirting, riding the ferris wheel, having someone love you more than anything, pancakes with realness, a house with a porch and a swing, someone who never leaves, memory, old world charm, playing, being yourself with someone without being afraid, and not giving up.
B007R41E8O|2.0|I like it but it's not as fun to me as some of the other Alawar hidden object games. I loved Snark Busters 1 & 2 and Treasures of Mystery Island because i had to piece together each object. In this game you find the objects already intact. It's great if you like the usual HOG. I'm still playing this one..but ready to move on already.  Edit: i wrote this review days ago but i am having to add more. I am SO ready to be done with this game. You have to use the hints on where to go.. otherwise.. you are just guessing. There is TOO much going back and forth to places and it is such a time waster. It's really unnerving! I started with a 4 star review but as i move along through the never ending game.. i brought it down to a 3 and now i'm taking it to a 2. This is not my type of HOB. Going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth is WAY too much for me! Bored with it, but will try to finish it since i paid for it. :/
B005THRU0C|4.0|I really love this CD. If Adele and Jason Mraz had a baby, it would be Ed Sheeran. And in case your wondering, that's a fantastic thing!
B0086700CM|5.0|no word describes it but Awesome it Is a wonderful game I love it so much its extremely addicting once u get into it BRAVE temple run is coming out and I greatly suggest it.
B0057B8PT0|5.0|I Love love love this CD. my new favorite! I probably listen to it everyday. Every song is catchy and they all get stuck in my head, in a good way!! Whoever is looking at this should buy this CD!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as it kept me guessing throughout the story.  I loved that the reader never knows if the main character's son, Jacob, really did/did not commit the crime.  The story isn't really about the result, but the journey the family is forced to take.  At times, I found myself disagreeing with the main character and thinking I would have proceeded differently had I been the one defending my son.  And just when you start to think along the same lines as Jacob's father, the story surprises the reader with two more twists that you just aren't prepared for!
B003KGBISY|5.0|The story is so great!  The characters are the best! The acting is beyond real! If you love movies that have a lasting effect on you get this film!
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Smashing pumpkins has always been my favorite band.<br /><br />They were doing great until after Machina where everything became a mess. This album is finally fresh air after all the garbage that came out. I LOVE this album, it is finally a return to the actual \\"Pumpkins\\" sound. Anyone who is a true fan will love this album. It is new, but also full of all of their classic spirit. Just pick it up!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just needed a simple, easy to see and use calculator for my kindle and nothing beats this one. very easy. big buttons. perfect for me. hasn't given me a single problem. :)
B0086700CM|1.0|hi I'm a player its fun but it ducks when I turned I landed in the water when I jumped I was dead don't get the game I'm warning you it also gets a virus sometimes I hats this game.
0345803485|5.0|The story line is exciting and you can not put it down.  Never a dull moment.  Does start off slow but after that none stop action.  You'll love it I did.
B007R41E8O|2.0|I downloaded this game because I enjoyed the Snark Busters games from the same developer. This game was at a similar quality at one level, but I was disappointed in parts. On the surface, the graphics are great. There are a bunch of fun puzzles to solve. I really like the backpack and the journal ideas, especially the journal. No other game so far has done a better job of keeping track of all the puzzles/solutions that you come across.<br /><br />On the down side, two things:<br /><br />For one, skipping from scene to scene there are a lot of scenes that are just pass through scenes or \\"forks in the road\\" kind of scenes. There is nothing to do here but move on through. It makes things confusing as you move through the game. Also, you'll have to find 12 objects in one scene, then back track 4 scenes away for the next thing. Plus, often you pick up some item, and have to move back through ten scenes to get back to the scene that needs that item. Use that item, then back the other way you go for one additional item, then again return to the scene that needs it. Back and forth, back and forth. And all without a map. If it weren't for the \\"hint\\" option that can highlight your path, you wouldn't know how to get anywhere. The story does not progress logically so you have to rely on your \\"hints\\".<br /><br />Secondly, the story itself is creepy. But that's the creators' intent. My issue is that at the end of the story, it is so MORBID! Creepy, morbid... Ugh. What an awful way to end a game. (It's a game, people, not a scary movie!) **SPOILER** It turns out the main character's sweet girlfriend, Angel, turns out to be just the opposite. After you go through the effort to save her, she ends up killing you and sacrificing you on the alter of the snake god. And then that's it...credits roll. I removed the game from my KF at that point. I usually replay my hidden object games, but not this one. No thanks.
B000IDGDPA|3.0|It never really grabbed my heart but it was more fun watching this than washing dishes.  Helen Hunt did not exactly look the part of a seductress but her looks made believable the point that Johannsen was her daughter.  It was a good movie.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I purchased this game second, after Snark Busters 2. It felt the same mostly, but quite as well thought out as Snark 2. But it was fun. Although story-wise, I didn't see how the spoiled rich girl's romp through the mirror had much to do with Snarks. Snark 2 at least had him hunting for clues... Oh well. It was fun.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this book.  All the tropes of space faring sci-fi with its implausible premises, its ridiculous scenarios, its positively dumb decisions made by executive officers, all of it is right here and delightfully mocked in such a clever way.  If you were a fan of any of the old shows, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Space 1999...any of them, you'll spot the \\"oh yeah...I remember when they did that on...\\" moments.  Lots of fun.  Looking forward to reading more of Scalzi's books.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|i play this game all the time. its fun and addicting. helps pass the time and work my eyes out a little.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Few directors have as instinctive a flair for the art of cinema as Terrance Malick, who is such a perfectionist about his work that he's managed to crank out a mere five feature films in his four decades as a filmmaker.  His films are like glorious odes to nature, much in the tradition of Wordsworth and Coleridge - only, in this age of modern technology, he uses images rather than words.  He makes us see the world from a whole new perspective, employing cinematography and music in much the same way as an impressionist uses paint on a canvas.<br /><br />Watching a Malick film - to mix up our metaphors a bit - is a bit like sitting at the edge of the ocean, as wave after wave of indescribably beautiful images washes over you and eventually carries you out to sea.  It really is an experience unlike any other that one can get at the movies.<br /><br />His latest work \\"The Tree of Life\\" is clearly his magnum opus, the culmination of his career-long obsession with the beauty of nature and mankind's relation to it.  It is also his most overt dissertation to date on the random nature of the universe, as it chronicles a family's struggle to come to grips with the sudden death of their 19-year-old son and brother, R.L.<br /><br />The majority of the film takes place in Waco, Texas in the 1950s, where the oldest son Jack and his two younger brothers, R.L. and Steve, are experiencing a childhood very similar to that of many middle-class Americans of the time.  In fact, when it isn't busy being metaphysical and exploring the mysteries of the universe, \\"The Tree of Life\\" provides a searing look into suburban family life during that time period.  Indeed, even though the characters don't say much to one another throughout the course of the movie - most of the words come in the form of voiceover narration - each still manages to become a fully realized individual in his or her own right, a character very much of that time but also universal in scope.<br /><br />Mr. O`Brien (Brad Pitt), for instance, is a rather archetypal father figure of the 1950s - an emotionally aloof disciplinarian who finds it so hard to express his feelings for his boys that at one point Jack finds himself wishing for his own father's death.  Yet, O'Brien still displays those rare moments of tenderness that reveal the caring and loving individual that resides at his core.  O'Brien is also struggling with the fact that he has never achieved his dreams either as a musician or as a successful inventor.  This leads to a sense of bitterness and a kill-or-be-killed ethos that not only defines his own life but is the major value he wants to instill in his boys.<br /><br />Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is also a fairly typical 1950s housewife - a generally passive woman utterly consumed with raising her family and defending her boys against the frequent outbursts her husband throws at them.  In a way, she is the yin to Mr. O'Brien's yang, a woman filled with the virtues of understanding and nurturing, who balances out the unyielding rigidness of her husband and gives her sons an alternative path to follow in life.<br /><br />Jack is also a highly complex character, a naturally curious, strong-willed and contemplative young boy who wants desperately to do the right thing but often feels unable to do it.  His strong moral code is frequently at odds with his penchant for mischief and, like all children who are just finding their way, he often chooses the wrong path to go down.  Indeed, the film provides one of the most realistic depictions of childhood I have seen in a long while, capturing the wonderment, fear and sense of exploration that defines that period in life.<br /><br />Sean Penn, in a much smaller role, plays the adult version of Jack, who, even in the present day, is trying to come to grips with his little brother's untimely death.  But it is Hunter McCracken as the young Jack who brings the film to life and makes us care about the character.<br /><br />As with any Malick film, \\"The Tree of Life\\" derives a tremendous amount of its greatness from its camerawork and sound and, true to form, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and composer Alexandre Desplat provide their customary miracles here.  No other movie quite looks like a Malick film, with its smooth-flowing tracking shots - many following a character from behind - its intimate close-up shots of nature, and its haunting, painterly landscapes.  For this film, Malick has added several scenes depicting the formation of the earth, the evolution of life and the destruction of the planet - all to illustrate the we're-all-interconnected, circle-of-life theme that resides at the movie's core.<br /><br />Yet while \\"The Tree of Life\\" is certainly Malick's most ambitious work to date, is it also his finest?  I really don't think so.  Even though it is completely mesmerizing as a work of pure cinema - few other directors could even touch it - it exudes a certain self-congratulatory pretentiousness that is missing from what I think are his best films, \\"Badlands\\" and \\"The New World,\\" which, on the whole, feel somehow more organic and natural.  In a sense, it's trying so hard to be great - hardly a commonplace sin in American moviemaking - that it actually feels a little off-putting and desperate at times.  Genuine masterpieces - which I believe \\"Badlands\\" and \\"The New World\\" to be - don't generally have to work so hard at it.<br /><br />But then again, in this day and of formulaic and soulless commercial moviemaking, we'll take a near-masterpiece any time we can get one.lick film, \\"The Tree of Life\\" derives a tremendous amount of its greatness from its camerawork and sound and, true to form, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and composer Alexandre Desplat provide their customary miracles here.

B0052AC8C6|2.0|The animation of this movie is first rate. However the story is a bit flat. Animators please note; lizards do not have belly buttons.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|This book was recommended on dear author blog.. it was sold as a special deal...<br />i like the tale woven in magic, true love and told in a lush setting...Silhara is a yummy hero...Its a really nice romantic read....Higly recommended..
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a fun game that anyone should play. there is always somthing to do and you can be entertained for hours. i love this game.
B00866H7SS|5.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly and recommend it to other readers...<br />The depth of the characters and the dialogue is marvellous...<br />This book was highly rated by a lot of blogs and they were right.<br />Will look forward to part 2 and 3 of this trilogy.
B007N31ZS8|3.0|this movie was the same as the version I purchased some 10 years ago.  You would think for a company's \\"centennial\\" edition of a very fine movie they would at least have made the widescreec anamorphic to fill the screen.  As it is all they did was add a digital copy but other than that it is the same thing - quite a disappointment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I began with renewal in faith and continue today with new plans everyday.  I love the topics sections you can find just about anything when your in need
B007G8MMP0|5.0|I bought this on laser disc several years ago and it is as entertaining and fresh as it was when it first came out.  Gary Sinise playing an evil character is so unusal to me that added to the fun of the story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids and I love this game!<br /><br />My kids and I love this game. They wake me up every morning to check on their village. Cute graphics..wish there was a way to get more acorns without having to purchase them though.
1475143389|5.0|I found this book to be very helpful to dispell many of the myths and presumed facts about fitness that abound today, especially with the onslaught of so many fitness magazines and experts.<br /><br />I like the honest, no nonsense approach, with no gimmicks, but tried and true techniques and dietary changes that anyone can dedicate themselves to.<br /><br />I do think that a beginning lifter should also consider the Mark Rippetoe, Starting Strength book as a nice companion to this book.  Also, make sure to download the PDF file from the website that is mentioned in the book.<br /><br />A very valuable resource.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|First off, I am not a usual Taylor Swift fan, male.<br />I am a huge classic rock and country fan though.<br /><br />Taylor is one of the best songwriters of our time. This girl writes songs that are so grown up and deep. So many people that don't listen to well brush it off as being songs for teenage girls. There are songs in this album for EVERYONE.<br /><br />Stand Outs of this album are  Tell Me Why, Forever and Always, Love Story, and You Belong with Me.<br /><br />For anyone that is on the fence about Taylor...go watch her 60 Minutes interview. The real deal!<br /><br />I would buy this album again
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|The game was awesome. I loved the graphics and gameplay. It is a good game for strategy game lovers. You get to choose your units and plan your route. It is worth four bucks. Great game.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I love this game it might not be good as Angry birds but it is great. this should be best selling
1250006341|5.0|Mad Men used to be my favorite show until it totally \\"jumped the shark\\" in Season 5.  Downton Abbey is my new favorite show.  This book has really great photos and interesting information.  I just wish there were more behind-the-scenes photos.  Dan Stevens (Matthew Crawley) is really hot.
B00772M1F6|5.0|I bought this CD after viewing several of the songs on it via Youtube and have made it my new favorite dance CD.  If you are a rock fan, this is a great choice.  If you are a country fan, this is a great choice.  JD McPherson's voice is quite unique and his images show his artistic background(ie:scratching circles in the old dance floor).
B0086700CM|5.0|My 7 year old grandson introduced me to this game....It's so ridiculously fun.....we both play until out fingers hurt....Temple Run msy cause carpal tunnel... :)
B007SYWFRM|3.0|the only really bad things I can think of are the fact that acorns are so hard to come by and there is such a short period of time before a baby runs away. otherwise very fun and entertaining.
1612680011|4.0|I always heard of this book but thought it was probably overrated.  First of all, I'd like to point out - just in case you didn't know - this has nothing to do with being a father.  The explanation of the book is below that.  That may seem obvious to some people, but if you don't remember this book coming out, I've found that some people are unaware of this fact.<br /><br />Secondly, it's a quick and interesting read.  Rather you agree with everything the author has to say or not, it's worth the read (and the price) because it gives a unique perspective.  His views on stocks, in particular, are not what most people would agree with.  However, the general premise - and a lot of the views on how to achieve \\"success\\" in life are worth examining.  If nothing else, this book will provoke some thought and that's what made me feel was worth the purchase.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|im glad that joe walsh is at it again..this album sounds like hes still got what it takes to rock the world! Thanx I love it!
0811876373|3.0|I love the unique ideas.  FYI - I believe you can find most of these on her website but I wanted them in one place that I could reference.  I got this for a large Easter crayfish boil my boyfiend's family does every year for a ton of people.  Because there are so many kids, I thought it would be fun to make a few festive cakepops.  The directions are clear and the pictures are great.<br /><br />That being said, this has one of those annoying spiral stems inside a hard cover.  And it's not just a regular sprial stem, it's the double kind.  Because of this the pages stick together, are hard to turn and are easy to tear. I wish I had known this before - I may have still purchased it but I'm not sure the quality is worth the price.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game and u will love it.<br />I play it almost all the time super super. u must buy it and the other one that's out the only thing is for most games new levels take a little while 2 come out so don't freak I learned that with all my games so yeah I like cake
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved it!!! Let's get this author up in the charts...this book deserves to be read!!!! It was a really fun read. Totally unique and entertaining.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|it is really fun but ive been waiting like a month for the new level and I aorta think the price is a little up there but really really cool : )
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read a lot. I mean, a LOT. My Kindle follows me everywhere like my security blanket. I'm also not a literary snob. I love a good, simple 'beach read' like anyone. So I got this series to check it out and was surprised I hated it as much as I do! The reviews stating that this must've been written by a teenager are right--even the worst 'beach reads' I have picked up are better than this stuff. It's not the sex scenes-those are hot enough. It's everything else. It's yet another book written by an author who hasn't been to the Seattle area who makes too many mistakes about locale. It's a very thinly-disguised copy of Twilight, only kinky sex and much worse writing and completely shallow plot (that's saying a lot as so many accused Twilight of being total crap writing--I did enjoy Twilight). Once I read that this was indeed Twilight fan fiction, it all made sense. So I clicked away from this one on my Kindle and inhaled the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. If you're looking for 'more', there's a good one for you!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm usually not a HUGE fan of YA novels.  I tend to like them a bit steamier :)  I purchased this book after it was recommended about a billion times and I can tell you that it is now one of my favorites.  Its sweet, its clever, its heartbreaking.  The fact that this is Colleen Hoover's first novel absolutely blows my mind.  Her talent is beyond words and I cannot wait to see what she writes next.
B007IQX1G4|5.0|this movie is weird and strange gave me the wrong idea its kinda backwards its about a girl tryin to get a guy most movies r the other way around
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book. Different twists made it interesting. I am new to David Baldacci and I plan to read more of his work.
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game. I thought it would ge ruined by IAP but no, Inwas never bothered by requesrs for purchases. Awesome game!
0765324849|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I haven't played through the game in years, and this book often made me go \\"oh yeah\\".  It gave a nice history of Rapture, told through multiple POV's.  It gave backgrounds of the characters, which really helped me understand the characters I remembered from the game.  Overall, it was easy to read, and it was quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Few complaints however.  Some parts just were not believable, which I think the book needed to accomplish.  In the book, the population was quite high, but playing the game, from what I remember, it never felt like you were in a metropolis.  It doesn't seem like Ryan could have recruited that many people in to Rapture in such a short time.<br /><br />The plasmids did not seem real to me.  Some of the first plasmids were winter blast, sport boost and incinerate.  I didn't feel that the creation of some were real, that the author needed to mention them.  It would have made sense to create sport boost at the start, because Fontaine was set on making people better.  But the other plasmids such as winter blast and incinerate didn't seem to make sense to be an \\"enhancer\\".  I felt like these could have been developed later, after conflicts began to rise between Fontaine and Ryan.  I just don't see real people getting these plasmids.  There appeared to be no real purpose behind them, only that the writer needed to incorporate the plasmids in to the book somehow.  I really think the author needed to make the plasmids believable.<br /><br />Sometimes mentioning of the splicers seemed forced to me.  They call out spider splicers and nitro splicers.  Just seemed unnecessary at times.<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer mentioned, how Fontaine entered the city doesn't seem all that real either.  Seemed way to easy.<br /><br />I think that is all.  Again, I enjoyed the book, and really want to go back and play the game again.  If you have played the game, I recommend reading this book, I can't imagine that you would bedisappointed.

1400031524|3.0|When I read \\"The Man from Beijing\\" a couple of years ago, I loved it so much that I decided to read Mankell's Kurt Wallender books.  For me, that was a big move, because I never used to read mysteries at all.  Stieg Larsson changed my mind about mysteries, and I was hoping that Mankell would be another pleasant surprise.  However, this was my second or third Wallender book, and I don't think I'll read any more.  He seems to be identical in all his books; there doesn't seem to be any growth or even change in the character from book to book, and I don't even understand his motivations - which is odd given his critical role in each of his books.  For example, why does he fall so madly in love with the widow of his Latvian counterpart to the point of obsession?  For a character who seems so devoid of passion for anything, it just seems out of place entirely.<br /><br />I do love the way Mankell writes - those clipped, short, barb-like sentences, combined with terse but adequate dialogue.  But the characters (even, I'm sad to say, Wallender) are all kind of cardboard cut-outs, and the plots are undistinguished.

0307949486|1.0|* SPOILER ALERT *<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" depicts women in a ludicrous and demeaning way.<br /><br />In a day and age where women are powerful political leaders (Hillary Clinton, Angela Merkel), entrepreneurs (Cher Wang of HTC, Meg Whitman), writers, scientists, artists, etc. it is shocking to encounter Larsson's pitiful female characters. At times his female characters, like Lisbeth Salander, seem tough and capable and other times they seem oddly stupid.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is a petite, rebellious young woman who has survived to adulthood with no parents and little adult supervision. As a child she was often vulnerable to exploitation. Yet she survives it all and become a self-sufficient adult with the amazing knack of digging up the most private and obscure information about any individual. She seems to have connections to the underworld and walks around with toughness that makes her look pretty darn threatening. But for some unknown reason this heavily pierced, sinister-looking young woman just happens to melt into a puddle of helplessness when she is faced with some stranger who is assigned to be her 'guardian'.<br /><br />In one scene Salander concocts a plan to defeat Nils Bjurman, who has been assigned as her new legal guardian. She thinks of guns, poisons, bombs, and a variety of different ways to kill him yet walks straight into his home only to be raped by him again. I find it very hard to believe that the highly intelligent Salander would be incapable of assessing how to deal with this situation. She is unable to avoid being raped a second time. Who in the world is that stupid?<br /><br />Larsson believes there is something fundamentally different between men and women and that is that men will fight and women will not. I wish he would come visit my local kickboxing gym where I see many women fight men twice their size and easily win (mainly because they're very good kickboxers).<br /><br />Another highly unrealistic female character is Erika Berger, Kalle Blomkvist's lover. She has a tendency to rush to his side and always be there for him when he needs her. She conveniently disappears when he doesn't (such as when he finds a new lover in Cecilia Vanger). Most women I know don't bother doing much for men who are not their husbands. And if they do, they don't conveniently disappear when the man takes on a new lover. Once again Larsson's fantasies has gotten the better of him.<br /><br />The original title of this book in Swedish should have been retained. It really is a book about \\"Men Who Hate Women\\", including the author himself.aracter is Erika Berger, Kalle Blomkvist's lover.

0739350323|1.0|...from the the hackneyed plot of this story while my family listened to the audiobook on the car stereo.  The chaotic introduction of plot devices, the gratuitous re-interpretation of historical events and mythical figures, the plodding explanatory dialogue for the twins' (and reader's) guidance, the gaping holes in the plot...I had to put my earphones and turn on the music loud enough to drown it out.  I got as far as Parinell pondering her escape.  As the narrator tells us how the long lives of elder race cause them to plan at a deliberate pace, moving over decades and centuries, the plot then, jarringly, goes to a member of the elder race planning a rash attack, instead of letting Nick Flemel age and die, since in five centuries he never bothered to make a copy of the oh-so-valuable codex and can't make his life-extending potions anymore.  Did the author even read his own manuscript?<br /><br />In fairness, the voice actor did a good job, and with a decent concept and some interesting characters there is the kernel of a good story here, but that is not enough to save it from the horrid plot development.<br /><br />Too poorly conceived for teens and adults, and too full of historical and mythical references for younger kids, I can't recommend this story to anyone.
B0051BNRTO|4.0|\\"Juliet, Naked\\", looks at a couple, Duncan and Anna, living together by default more then by choice in a dead end seaside town in the North of England. Duncan is obsessed with a singer songwriter called Tucker Crowe who made some records that achieved cult record status back in the seventies and then one day abandons everything and disappears. Duncan runs a web site where he and like minded souls analyze the lyrics, speculate on where Tucker is now and indulge their obsessive fandom. Then one day Tucker issues a new album albeit of old tapes and sends an email to Anna....<br /><br />The novel is funny and touching at the same time and the characters absolutely convincing. \\"Tucker\\" starts the novel as a kind of mythical Syd Barret like character and his transition from myth to real life character is very nicely done. The web and internet are important to the plot but it needs an author with Hornby's talent to make these devices interesting. A welcome return to form for Nick Hornby and warmly recommended. I have a bit more to say about this novel and why I like the author in my cultural blog - you are welcome to visit the link in my profile.

B006H8BIIM|5.0|After playing the game for a short while I can say it is one of the better FAOTD games I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />While there is a option to purchase upgrades at this point I don't think it is necessary.<br /><br />I am able to get around 1,000 credits for 20 minutes of playing in the mining campaigns, that can be played with a random setup, semi making it new levels every time.  I could do this much more quickly if there was a pause to layout structures, but not really required in a RTS.<br /><br />There are only 15 levels, but with the amount of options you can purchase I think this will be an appropriate amount since eventually like all games it will get repetitive.<br /><br />Enjoy, strategist, and ***SPOILER ALERT*** purchase energy upgrades on your base first.  It will make the game a little easier.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's GONE GIRL is a quiet suspense thriller told from the stand points of the spouses dipped in the blood of the not so innocent.<br />On the morning of Amy and (Lance) Nick dunne's five year wedding anniversay Nick comes home from the bar that he and his sister own to find Amy GONE!!  What follows is a brilliantly written fictional study on the unravelling of a marriage and how the media circus fuels an uncontrollable fire. While I was reading this beautifully written, somber, at times brutally violent tale of a marriage I had flashbacks to the various 'wife gone missing' cases that has haunted the american public i.e Scott Peterson, Drew Peterson (note the last names???) and Mark Hacking just to mention a few..a missing wife and all forms of the media presume 'he' is guilty!<br />Told from Nick Dunne's persepective from the morning of her vanishing and Amy's diary in hope's of being found..the two stories collide in a 'white knuckle' investigation where nothing is what it seems..As their tales come to light we as the voyeurs (readers) can't help but begin to choose sides as if it was all over tv, internet and newsprint.<br />What is really going on a one of the pleasant surprises about GONE GIRL.  Ms. Flynn has taken her time and fleshed out every character to pure exhaustian.<br />After you end the book, either you will in some ways cheated by what happens or you will see and think about it and realize this novel HAD to end this way!<br />In my opinion...six stars!<br /><br />Jim Munchel/Co-Manager of Books<br />Books A Million/ Harrisburg, Pa.

0061906220|5.0|We love this book; it is a great find that my 6,5, and 2-year-olds enjoy!  I don't understand how the Library reviewer could say, \\"The moral of the story keep going no matter what happens to you in life may sound like good advice, but it doesn't instill any sense of power in children it just tells them to accept their fate.\\"  I think how you look at what life throws at you, while staying true to who you are, is a powerful message.  Maintaining a positive attitude can get an individual through many hardships in life and I think this simple story conveys how a positive attitude can elevate a person to handle whatever life throws your way.<br /><br />Keep walking proud, Pete!

B004LWZWBU|1.0|I ranked this movie with the worst movies ever made, but what can you expect when Owen Wilson is part of the cast, I don't know how he ever got hired as an actor. The plot behind this movie is among the stupidist I have ever seen and shows just how desperate hollywood is for something to dump on the public. Jack Black and Steve Martin must be getting really desperate for work to be a part of this waste of film. The writers, director and producer should all be banned from film making for life so we don't end up wasting our time watching any more of their crap! I just wish Amazon would allow a zero star rating which would be more appropriate for this thing!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Venture on down to Louisiana for this Disney film.  I found it very enjoyable.  It's a story of an African-American girl named Tiana who grows up looking for her prince, while she dreams of opening her own diner.  Tiana works as a waitress and tries to save enough money so she can open her own eatery.  She winds up kissing a grog, getting transformed into a frog herself.  Then they go on a quest to return to human form.  Being where this story does take place in Louisiana there is a certain amount of let's say the darker side of Louisiana including things like voodoo. All in all it's a very interesting film.  Recommended.

0812416503|5.0|This is a classic gothic mystery, centered on a naive young woman working as a companion, who is swept off her feet by a man suffering after the death of his first wife, the dark and dashing, Maxim de Winter. While all seems well as they honeymoon, upon returning to his home in Cornwall, Manderley, things begin to slowly unravel. The young woman, unnamed throughout the novel, feels very much out of place as lady of the manor and becomes consumed with finding out more about his first wife, Rebecca, who seems very much present in her surroundings, particularly to the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who was also Rebecca's personal maid. After a devilish betrayal by Mrs. Danvers, the 2nd Mrs de Winter begins to find out more about Rebecca and the circumstances surrounding her death which completely change her world view and bring out her strengths. While reminiscent of Jane Eyre, the novel stands well on its own and is an intriguing tale of deception, suspense, and a touch of mystery.<br /><br />I would comment that the print quality of this edition was very uneven, and at times, difficult to read.
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|\\"Canada\\" is the first Richard Ford book I have read, actually I should say \\"attempted\\" to read. And it will be my last. Rather than a page turner it was a five pages at once turner. And you know what happened in those five pages I skipped, nothing. Frankly, I am not a big prose fan but if it is intermingled with a riveting story then bravo, but the boring repetitive thoughts of a 15 year, even considering his circumstances left me, after about 200 pages, wanting out. I heard Mr. Ford say that this book was in his head for three years before he began writing it. That's where it should have stayed.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It's like an old school space rpg.  Easy on the battery, high on fun.  Strong developer support brings constant updates and new features, though Amazon is slow to post them.  What more could you ask for?
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was an excellent story of a bad boy meets a good girl; I really enjoyed this easy read. However the editing wasn't the best so as long as you can over look that you will be just fine! Read this book in about 2 days, once I started didn't want to stop. I love how the ending leaves room for another book. I hope there is an additional book for the series because Travis and Abby work well together.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|Although hinging on the events of 9-11, this is not a movie about 9-11.  In fact it is the story of one boy, who must come to terms in his own unique way with the loss of his father.  The boy is a sensitive soul, and looks at the world with a unique set of eyes.. possibly he has Aspergers, but it is never made clear.  His relationship with his father (Tom Hanks, who has minimal screen time, but whose presence is nonetheless felt through much of the movie) was strong, with Hanks spending plenty of time with him, setting adventures for his son that would encourage him to interact with the outside world.  When 9-11 takes his dad's life, he sets off on a final quest, to find the lock that fits a key he has found in his dads things.<br />First of all, it has to be said that Thomas Horn, playing the boy, carries the movie - he gives a quite extraordinary performance, which compels you to believe his world.  Without this performance the movie would be very slight indeed, relying somewhat on contrivance as it does.  Of course there are memorable supporting roles too.. notably Max von Sydow playing an elderly mute who shares an emotional bond with the boy.  These characters along the boys journey, combined with his performance, really make the journey worthwhile, as we see the boy learning that his loss is not the only loss in the world, that through the microcosm of the city he meets on his quest for the key, he understands more about what his father wanted for him, and makes emotional steps as well as figurative ones.<br />There are times in the movie that the sense of grief is laid on just a little too thick, mostly in the scenes with Bullock as the boys mum and Hanks widow, to the point where I wondered if I really wanted to spend two hours in their company.  However as the movie ties up the loose ends (perhaps a little too neatly?) at the end, the final result is rewarding and poignant in a positive way.  It's almost a shame that the story does not leave a little more unanswered, as the result is moving, yes, at the time - but leaves little to ponder or to resonate in the days after you watch it, robbing this of classic status.  Having said that, however much I was aware how the movie was manipulating me, it actually did successfully push my buttons.  No movie can really encompass some magical coming to terms with something on the scale of 9-11, but viewed as a personal and introspective story, this actually works quite well.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I have read the pocket book of Dune and now rereading it on the kindle.  I haven't noticed any miss spelled words if any like some kindle book reviews suggest.  The book seems to be all there and Dune is a blast to read.  Truely a great scifi novel.  Occasionaly I think the author gets sentences that just seem to run forever.  But they do work.  Read aloud with a bit of emotion and it comes to life.  The author has several different religions mixed into the story and many great Scifi elements such as desert planet, sand worm, a baron, folded space travel, bene gesserits, and spice and the weirding way.  I wish the movie could be redone and include more of the book in it, but I think it would have to be done with models and not CGI to work properly.  Some people complain about the individual story lines being too long and too numerous, but I didn't think it was really that difficult to keep track.  There are mainly just three being the Emperor, Harkonnen, and Atredies.  If you like Scifi, you have to read Dune and kindle version is a very good version.  It even has the dictionary in it.

055358202X|4.0|A friend told me not to waste my time with this book, skip to the next in the series. After reading Feast for Crows I told him he was wrong. It is true that it does not provide progress for several major characters but it developes the continuing saga quite masterfully. Given the attrition of characters from the preceding book, I found this story rich with the kind of quirky personalities and odd twists that I have grown to love. So sorry for those who don't like it but--- if I had skipped this book I would have missed the complexity of an absorbing story. Granted, the ending is frustrating and the explantion by the author is extraneous, still a good story.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I used these for around a year, after they stopped working due to harsh usage. I bought a couple of slightly expensive ones, but still missed them due to their light weight and good sound (for money). So bought them again!<br /><br />Don't expect them to be on par with those 100$ headphones, but they are decent for less than ten bucks! Sound is clear. The bass is good, but not excellent. they fit snug and sometimes you even forget they are on. Since they are made of plastic, might be uncomfortable for some, but work for me!

B00198X0VS|2.0|When MIB1 debuted in July of 1997, I've loved it. It was funny, action packed and managed to squeeze in just enough science fiction folklore to create a genuine sense of wonder. So, my expectations for MIB2 were high, much too high. I hated it. Everything I had loved about the first movie had been neglected or ignored. Where the hell was Linda Fiorentino!?!? Okay, I'm a realist, in all likelihood the studio and her agent couldn't come to terms. And since I hate the movie anyway, its just as well that they didn't recast her character but still, what happened to her character? All right, bottom line is, if you like MIB1 then skip right over to MIB3, it is not great either and does seem to totally disregard the character's back stories from the first movies, what happened to Agent K's wife? But, it is entertaining, Josh Brolin is priceless as a young Agent K, and a lot more fun than MIB2. I give MIB2 two stars because any movie where Lara Flynn Boyle appears in Victoria's Secret is worth at least two stars. I know it's been 15 years and you've all ready been exposed to the horror that is MIB2 but, for the sake of future generations, Please heed my words of warning.[[ASIN:B00177YA1K Men in Black]]
B0052VUNHC|2.0|This book is clearly written for a younger crowd than I admittedly am....however, I have always enjoyed fiction geared towards the younger set anyway (Hunger Games, etc).  I also never really write reviews, but I feel that I have to let unsuspecting mothers out there that you do not want your daughters reading this!  It is a pretty well-written book with the basis of a good plot.  However, the dysfunction between these two individuals is unbelievable and scary, and is never addressed by the author.  She gave casual references to the dysfunction where the main character, Abby, would recognize that she was falling for someone like her father, or when her best friend America said it was \\"the most dysfunctional\\" relationship.  But, it really glamorizes several scary things such as 1) handling conflicts by beating the crap out of people (HELLO - where are the cops???) 2) handling problems by drinking yourself into oblivion and 3) it is ok to stalk someone if you love them because doesn't everyone express love by forcing someone to do something they don't want to do??  The \\"hero\\" of the book needed to be arrested because he is clearly a wife beater in the making (hello alcoholism) - he just hasn't gotten there yet.  The message sent is really bad, and the author could have made this a true novel by recognizing and really addressing some of the true issues with these two.  I think the situations were real, but the end message is if you love someone enough all the really bad problems will disappear - the old \\"love conquers all\\".  And it doesn't, which would have made it a better and more true story.  Girls with self-esteem issues, like Abby, do tend to gravitate to abusive, controlling relationships (which is what this is - make no mistake - it is not love).  It is a shame that the author rushed to the end, tied the bow, and ignored the chance to show some of the repercussions of that.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book was fantastic!  For me it was reminiscent of Gemmell, one of my favorite fantasy authors.  I can't say much that all the other reviews have not covered so I will keep this simple and to the point.  The pacing was excellent, dialogue was smooth and effortless, and the character development was top notch.  I loved the camraderie between the boys that grew up together in the sixth order.  I though Ryan did a good job explaining the training process, which is always one of my favorite parts of a good fantasy.  It adds believability to the action sequences further on in the book.  There were some errors as noted by other reviewers but nothing that was too distracting for me, besides, I find errors in many well known famous authors, as well as my own work.  From one author to another, editing is the most difficult part of writing.  This book read as smoothly as any main stream fantasy author.  I was happy to hear that Mr. Ryan was picked up by a publisher.  He deserves it and I hope that everything works out for him in the future.  I look forward to reading many more books from him.  Well done!<br />Jason McWhirter (author of The Cavalier)
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|I liked the movie. I thought it was entertaining.  Its not \\"Forest Gump\\" or \\"Predator\\" but its entertaining.  I don't know why the dude from Disney got fired over it, \\"John Carter\\" has some simularities with \\"Star Wars\\" and the books were written by \\"ERB\\" (Tarzan, etc.) so they (\\"John Carter\\" books) have been around for a long time, long before \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy started.  And yes the books are entertaining as well.  The movie was well worth the $4.99 I paid on Amazon Video.  They have a lot of movies same as cable and satalite (mis-spelled) for a couple bucks less, save money where you can now-a-days.
0345803485|2.0|After everyone raved about this trilogy, I bought the first one. I had been warned about the sex scenes, although no one told me they were that...intense; but reviewers told me that the storyline was great. After reading this book, though, I wasn't impressed with the plot, character development or descriptions beyond the sex scenes. To me, if you give this book 4 or 5 stars, you're very sexually deprived.<br /><br />It's kind of like Twilight in the sense that the POV is that of a teenager and it's not well-developed - it's just a guilty pleasure saga. While that worked for Stephanie Meyer, I don't think it works as well for E.L. James. First, the author isn't very young - quite the opposite. Secondly, and I hate to admit this, I think the Twilight saga was better developed. It pains me to write that because I was the first to shun the books based on that, but this Fifty Shades trilogy is nothing more than very kinky sex in explicit detail. And lastly, we've already been there with the Twilight saga.<br /><br />I do, however, feel that it's a fun, light read. You don't need a brain or imagination to get through these books. The only thing that keeps this trilogy going is the mystery of Grey's past. If you don't care about that and you're not sexually deprived, then you'll easily put this book down and move on to well-developed books.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would have given a 5 star rating, but the adds are annoying. I can't skip them on my phone.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is pretty awesome its kinda like cartoon wars but its better it gets addicting too i really like it.
B00881VLCE|2.0|The app was a good time waster before the recent update. Now everytime I power up my kindle I receive an error that the program would not launch.  Time to try a different jigsaw app.
0345803485|4.0|I read this and was in trapped in the book at page one. I could not put it down until, I was finish with it and had the other two books in hand.
B0002DSUEI|5.0|This is a very high quality 5.1 SACD recording which I played via my oppo SACD/DVDA/CD/DVD player, Marantz SR6006 amplifier with two high quality Axiom MV80 speakers for the front speakers and two high quality Mission Speakers for the rear soundstage.<br /><br />The music was impeccably performed and Krall's voice came through beautifully.  For me, it was like actually listening to the live performance in an acoustically balanced studio without the distraction and unwanted sounds common with a live audience performance.<br /><br />If you look this type of jazz performance, you will fully enjoy this disc.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|light hearted. clean fun.easy to play but keeps your interest. graphics are great. the animals are fun to watch.I really like the goals and games u can play
B005E94WB0|5.0|First time I've owned a bluetooth, decided to get the carrying case for the Plantronics Voyager PRO+.  It fits perfectly.  Well worth the money.
B0018LX9T4|1.0|Normally I have an open mind and always read reviews before buying something. After both of those I would have to say this was a complete waste of time and money. Amazon and the vendor worked well with me on the return. I just wish I could get the 2hrs of my life back that I spent watching it. The most entertainment this DVD could offer is to put it in the microwave for 10 seconds and watch the light show.
0380977273|5.0|When a shadowy carnival comes to town, promotional flyers touting a dusty witch, a skeleton, magic mirrors and the most beautiful woman attract the attention of 2 boys, the best of friends, having been born each side of midnight. But this is not a regular carnival, full of wonder and excitement. People start disappearing from town, a strange boy appears, and the carousel plays the Funeral March music backwards.<br /><br />The level of suspense and creepiness escalates with the turning of each page. But it's no simple horror story. Bradbury weaves a colorful and at times, poetic fantasy, bringing our best childhood nightmare creatures to life between the pages, and leaves us scrambling to grasp at a slim hope that an unlikely character might actually have the answer to stop them from devouring our two boys.<br /><br />What's especially impressive is Bradbury's ability to draw out the natural curiosity of boys who are full of life, one always just running towards what the future might bring, and the other leaping along more cautiously, one arm outstretched to protect his friend if danger should present itself.<br /><br />The suspense is held like a taut string all the way till the last chapter of the book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Graphics are great and the challenges keep the game interesting. Awesome game to play when bored and trying to pass time.

0393080269|4.0|Sharma's book successfully makes the (sometimes overlooked) point that not all emerging markets are the same. He treats individual markets as unique stories and uses a mix of data, personal observation, and history to predict which countries will be stars (South Korea, Poland, Turkey), which will grow but disappoint (China, Brazil, Russia), which are 50-50 bets (India), and which will continue to struggle to develop. Each chapter is devoted to one or more markets, so he never sets out an overarching set of factors to look for in pinpointing the \\"next economic miracles.\\" Nonetheless, he focuses on key data points such as direct investment as a % of GDP, the level of government control of key companies, reliance on commodity exports as a % of GDP, welfare state spending, level of government and private debt, and demographics.<br /><br />He does not consider political structure important, arguing that growth rates depend on good leaders and policies rather than on the particular classification of government. He also largely ignores education levels, except for a short story on Intel's failure to find skilled Vietnamese workers at a newly constructed plant. By considering countries in isolation, he misses a chance to discuss how they will grow together and interact in the global marketplace. Since most of his opinions are based on his personal travels to emerging markets, the bibliography is a bit thin and thus verifying his arguments is difficult. In short, this is a very good book for providing insights into individual markets and the writing makes for enjoyable reading even though there are some limits to his analysis. It is more nuanced and thoughtful than other popular books on international economics such as Dambisa Moyo's \\"How the West was Lost.\\"
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|Can't believe Chris just keeps getting better and better. What a truly talented man. This CD was fantastic. Saw them perform in San Francisco and I would highly recommend seeing them - I will definitely see them again when they come back around. All of Daughtry's CD's are great. Buy them all.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I have the originial VHS and then the delux VHS, but DVD is not only easier to work with, it also came with a special edition disc, which I loved watching, as well as being able to watch it with commentary.  Knowing all the trials and tribulations of making Star Wars makes it more remarkable than it was before. Lucas and his staff, and everyone in the film and behind the scenes created a special kind of magic.
1572814136|5.0|this is my second deck of tarot cards.<br />my first deck was the giant rider-waite tarot deck.<br />these cards are radiant, as the name implies...<br />they are beautiful to look at, and what's most important<br />(to me) i connected with these cards a soon as i opened<br />the package. if you are just starting out, as i am,<br />you want a tarot deck that you are comfortable with.<br />i am able to read and interpet these cards better than with<br />my previous purchase. and the are easier to handle. :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. I use it every day. all the versions I want. it also has easy twitter and facebook integration.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I stumbled onto this game by chance as it was one of those &quot;free app for the day&quot; promos. What surprised me was that it wasn't a free trial run, but instead the whole game was FREE! Plus, I'm a big fan of hidden objects game &amp; i've had good experienxes w/ G5 games so I figured, why not?<br /><br />It started out pretty well, but the dialogs got lenghty where it became annoying, the story line lacked excitement as it progressed, the mini games in the office scene had no clear connection to the plot, &amp; the climax was uneventful. The graphics, however, were decent &amp; searching for the items had their challenges.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend it so much unless the price was $1.99 or less or even better - FREE!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Great movie, shows true dedication needed to be a Navy Seal,shows the costs and pressure on the families that most people don't realize.<br />Thanks for what you guys do !!!!!!
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|Well, goodness.  So many angry, upset people who regret having wasted their time watching this film.  Really?  Okay.  I can see that.  I agree wholeheartedly that the film is too long and the editors could have easily sliced out a good thirty minutes and not damaged the movie at all. It DOES drag on in places, and some of it is just too obscure and metaphorical.  In fact, I totally expected to hate this film after reading some of the reviews in advance.  Then someone, somewhere reviewed The Tree of Life and wrote that Brad Pitt's character and Jessica Chastain's character (mom and dad in the movie) represent the two equal natures (perceptions?) of God:  the strong disciplinarian and the loving, forgiving, nurturing Giver of grace.  If viewed from that perspective from the get-go, the movie tends to make a lot more sense, especially in light of the mother's opening monologue in which she talks about each person's choice between nature and grace.  In fact, I was shocked to see how many Scriptural references there actually are in this movie, especially since Brad Pitt and Sean Penn have always presented themselves as stridently anti-Christian and anti-religion.  Obviously the very first shot of the quote from the Book of Job is a reference to the Bible; however, there are others. **SPOILER ALERT***  For example, at one point, young Jack is reflecting on his own bad behavior and says, \\"The things I want to do I can't do, and what I don't want to do, I keep on doing,\\" or words to that effect.  This is reminiscent of Paul's remarks in Romans 7 in the New Testament.  Young Jack is confused and frustrated by his own sinfulness (bullying, animal cruelty, vandalism, breaking and entering, stealing, etc.) and says, \\"I want to be back where they are,\\" meaning his younger brothers and their friends, who are still fairly innocent and naive.  I also respect how the film deals with the faith-shattering disillusionment that often comes as a result of terrible tragedy.  The characters ask God, \\"Where are you?  Are you even here?\\"  Jack remarks that, \\"You call to me; I've always known it was you, but I have turned away from you.\\"  These are all very valid responses, and very realistic.  Before everyone gets all bent out of shape, I am NOT saying the movie is a Christian allegory or that it is proselytizing in any way.  However, there is a definite spiritual element to the film, and it actually fits very well with the absolutely stunning visual imagery (creation, random destruction, etc.).  Does Sean Penn's character die at the end, or is he only dreaming?  That's not entirely clear, but we do hear a steady beeping (heart monitor?) in the background which eventually fades out as he crosses through a portal and then \\"reunites\\" with members of his family from long ago. A reference to the afterlife?  Maybe. It's not a bad film, just poorly edited, in my very humble opinion.  The dinosaurs kind of trivialized it, and I know Mom floating under the tree (her ethereal, lighthearted forgiving essence?) made people cringe.  All in all, I may have to check out Terence Malick's other movies.  This one was very intriguing.
B006GHA9VQ|1.0|First of all I absolutely loved the performance .  I saw the play in London and could not wait to purchase this DVD/Blu-ray.  However, the actual DVD/blu-ray was defective.  The sound quality faded out on the high notes.  I returned the DVD and purchases another one and it did the same thing in exactly the same places.  I wrote to Universal and complained, they said it was my DVD/Blu-ray played. I updated my blu-ray firmware etc and the problem still persisted.  I returned the second one and got a refund.  I'll wait a few months and try again.  By the way the same thing happened to me with the \\"Phantom 25 yr Celebration\\" bly-ray.  I returned it and repurchased it a few months later and the problem seemed to correct itself.  The DVD/Blu-rays are made in Mexico by the way.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Has every episode, well sectioned off into six sections. Great quality of sleeves and case. The discs are gorgeous. As far as the DVD content goes, it has every episode plus commentary and special effects sprinkled within. There's also a special features disc at the end which I would not recommend watching until you've seen every episode. All in all, a high quality set for the best show on television.
0606259090|1.0|This book is like a porn movie... Tons of sex and a weak predictable plot.  It took me two months to painfully get thru this book.  Save yourself the time and money.  I'm glad to see the reviews are getting more realistic.

0439023491|5.0|Miranda Carlisle<br />Dr. Beth Gully<br />English 106<br />July 3, 2012<br /><br /> I would like to start off by saying if you haven't read the first book Hunger Games, then you will be lost in this book. Catching Fire is the type of book you can't put down. Its an easy read and you will be done with it in no time, I was excited for the third book Mocking Jay to come out. A little background from book one is there are twelve districts and each year the Capital takes two people, a male and female, to fight till there is one standing and they are the Victors. Well the 74th year is when Katniss and Petta were picked for the hunger games. Little did they know Katniss would come out on top, alongside Petta, they threatened to take their lives if they didn't both live. Katniss was the master mind of this act, the Capital let them both live. Now, in book two Catching Fire, the president think that since Katniss rebelled against the Capitals rules, she could be trouble coming his way. The 75th anniversary was in this book and every five years they through a twist in the game and this year's twist was they would only draw names from the victors. Katniss was the only female from the victors and Petta was in love with her so he would volunteer for Haymitch, the only other male winner from district 12 besides Petta. Therefore, once again Petta and Katniss ended up in the dome to fight to the death. Long story short there is an outbreak during the games Katniss is taken by some rebelers and wanted to be the symbol of rebellion, The Mocking Jay. But I don't want ruin the book for you so you will need to read it! In this book there are so many up and downs, twist and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. This book has a love triangle, action and a bunch or drama. If you haven't guessed it by now I would strongly suggest you read this book, and Hunger Games!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book had a good story line for young women.  It was a little fantasy oriented such as: Rich, good looking man meets girl.  The erotic sex scenes were interesting but not too believable to the average woman.  But fantasy is a good read and I enjoyed it.  I would like to know more about the author and about other works in her library.  The story kept one interested and waiting for the unexpected. I am surprised how many women have read these books without much review of them. I have read Book Two and am now on Book Three.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This is a brilliantly executed story about true happenings in Australia including the `missionary work' ~ you know the lies told justifying one's cruelty, racism, horrible acts by saying one is doing God's work which among other things was until 1973 the forcible abduction and removal of Aborigine Children from their families and homes by the ignorant ruling class of Australia; life in Australia for all in pre World War II; language, traditions and growing up as an Aborigine after whites displaced the natives.<br /><br />The movie is a bit slow in the beginning, but it does pull through at the end, though without giving away spoilers, it does uncourageously still make the religious look `good, heroic' like their willing participation and possibly instigation of `saving the heathens souls' by stealing as many native children from their families and homes and imprisoning them in mission schools could in ANY lifetime be considered good work, or the choice of an `intelligent, benevolent, all-knowing being.'<br /><br />Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman seemed a bit stiff in their roles for the first half of the movie, but did great the second half.<br /><br />Hats off to David Wenham who did a brilliant job as a hateful, cruel character, I still want to beat the #!%# out of him.<br /><br />All the aborigine actors did a beautiful job of telling a story from that character's point of view: the woman raped by any white man who felt inclined; the young boy, Nullah who's father was a white ignoramous; the tracker enslaved to the whites; the shaman; and the brother and friend of Hugh Jackman's character. Brilliantly telling the story of what it was like to be in one's homeland that had been stolen by the white settlers.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it works really good.<br />better than all the other stuff I tried.<br />might have exaggerated I mean NOTHING is as awesome as ninjas.
B002YCVX5S|3.0|This was not at all the film we were led to believe it would be from promos. Note, especially, that it is listed as a comedy on the Amazon Prime streaming channel, and it is anything but.<br /><br />It is a brutal WWI picture, and there is copious, merciless amounts of blood.<br /><br />I am certain the acting is fine throughout, but having sought a funnier film (seriously, how stupid could I have been here?) we stopped watching less than a half-hour in.
034580404X|5.0|Love my purchase of the \\"50 Shades Trilogy\\" box set.  Read all three books back to back and thoroughly enjoyed them all. They will be on my Top 10 favorite books to read over and over again.  This unconventional romance trilogy was riveting and at times heartbreaking.  Not my usual type of books to read.  But on the suggestion of a friend I decided to give these books a go and I'm happy I did. One of the best purchases I've made in the last couple of months.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Could anyone believe Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys would gather together again? And produce a whole album of original songs? And that the new songs were so good they´re up to their best material from their golden days? well, I didn´t. When a friend showed me this CD I was very skeptical. Until I heard it and was completeely knocked out by it. I had to get it and spent the next two weeks listening to it non stop.<br /><br />Too hard to explain on the finely craft vocal harmonies that only the BB can do, the perfect production, the amazing songs and the tasteful arrangements. Everything fits. Ok, the lyrics are mostly about their past, but who cares? It´s simply BEAUTIFUL music! Just listen and feel in heaven!! Not a single weak track. My only gripe with this CD is its short time (39 minutes). But what a great time!<br /><br />If you are remotely atracted to BB music, then That´s Why God Made The Radio is a must have! This is the best reunion CD I have ever heard in my life. Ten stars for this one!
0439023513|4.0|I was happy with my purchase of the last book in The Hunger Games Trilogy.  I had read the first two books in the series prior to purchasing book #3:  Mockingjay.  The book was what I expected and what I was hoping for in a last book of a series. I was left feeling very satisfied with my choice to purchase this book.

1407109367|5.0|\\"...Catching Fire, just like its predecessor, is absolutely amazing. The entire series so far is thrilling; Collins writes in such a way that it is very easy to become immersed in the world she has created in Panem: to visualize the surroundings as if you were there yourself, to find yourself crying with and for characters at emotional moments, to find yourself holding your breath for several pages before finally sighing with relief or gasping and/or yelling out of something else entirely, be it anger, disbelief, or surprise. There is every bit as much suspense and action as in The Hunger Games - arguably more, even, and the stakes are much higher now that the citizens of all the districts are potentially involved, affected by whatever move is made. This time, it isn't just about killing or out-living 23 other people. It's about Prim. Rue's family. Gale. Peeta. Her mother. Everyone...\\"<br /><br />For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:<br /><br />[...]
B007TNS6JI|1.0|I downloaded the game but I needed 793 Mb. then I had that much. then it said I needed 728 Mb. I did that and it said I needed 238 Mb. I did that then it said I needed 128 Mb. I was actually looking forward to playing it, and I cant.
B006GRBK4G|5.0|In full disclosure, I am a TT fan first and MotoGP second.  That being said, Fastest is the best of the three films in this trilogy.  The cinematography was phenomenal.  The breadth of their coverage of the sport in recent times was very good.  Interviews with riders and fans was quite good too.  If you don't like Rossi, you won't like this film. Much of the film focuses on his accomplishment and his personality.  I really liked the soundtrack as well.  My brother-in-law, who has little to no interest in motorcycles was transfixed by the footage and stopped what he was doing and sat with me to watch most of this fine film.<br /><br />The theme of this film concerns the level of perfection that is needed to win in this sport and the amount of danger that still exists. It focuses on the the amount of dedication that riders like Rossi, Lorenzo and Stoner have needed in order to succeed in the sport.  The extra features are forgettable but the main event is good enough to give this five stars.  If you love MotoGP, you must see this film.  You will enjoy the footage even if you just have a casual interest in motorcycle racing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use,  large numbers and bright good colors like that is shows you what you've just added or subtracted. great feature!!!
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This album is so complete, the only song that is out of context is \\"Until it breaks\\", but beyond that the album is great. Definitely my favorite song is \\"Powerless\\", an excellent composition. \\"Living Things\\" is a more mature album than previous ones, for more mature people, if you do not like it because you're a teenager who expects to be bad listening \\"New Metal\\" ..... This album is the evolution of such classics as HT or Meteora ..... accept it, who doesn't evolve is doomed to disappear
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved every minute of the trilogy.  Sexy,interesting story-line.  Made me wonder what the authors life was like as I've heard that writers write about what they know!!!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I want something without limits like minecraft,but when you hit the road you want something good to play.But when I saw the reviews I thought this will be fun
B002BWP49C|5.0|I received the dvd I ordered just fine and in good condition.  however the movie itself was not as good as the first two...but that is not the sellers fault.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|These two attributed apply to us all, especially in love between the sexes.  Feelings without communication are not always known to the other.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|What a fantastic read. Keeps you addicted until the very end. Its erotic, brave, and ultimately a beautiful love story.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|This is another one sooo cute. I purchased full version and it's well worth it. We had a great time laughing and his face is so cute..love it!
B00884GR0W|4.0|Ok, I like the game. it's really pretty cool. Its like minecraft, but pleasantly different. Its an overall great game. However, there are some adjustments that need to be made in the next update. Doors. This game needs doors. Right now I'm using flowers as doors, but animals still glitch into my house. Please fix. This game also needs some kind of creature that tries to break into your house at night. who cares if they're zombies, just something. By the way, I love the Jack'O'Lantern light. good thinking. Also, Let us create ladders instead of having to make bulky stairs everywhere. Oh, and here's something minecraft doesn't have. Furniture. As in chairs, couches, a radio block, (you already have a bed). The radio doesn't have to work, it would just make a room look a lot nicer. Could you guys make this game wick capatible so we can see other people? not be able to destroy other people's houses. with Tnt like minecraft, but make it more interesting. If you guys will take this seriously and make some adjustments listed above, or any others, in your upcoming updates, that would be great. I wold give it ten stars if I could.
B0006Q0XDW|5.0|what can i say about this album other than its one of the best albums ever so groundbreaking and inspiring for so many artists the clash def were the only band that mattered as they liked to say if you wanna buy this dont bother thinking just buy it you will not regret it this album will never get old and will be talked about forever it will change and maybe even safe your life and even if you hate the clash you still would buy it or want to buy it thats when you know that london calling is a great album
B008220B0C|5.0|Highly loved the documentary, even though I usually am not into such things. Never knew about Katy Perry's life and how hard things were for her. Right after the short presentation on youtube, I knew I had to watch it. It gives a lot of information on her which I knew nothing of, including her wonderful personality. This 1 hour documentary will be useful for any of the Katy Perry's fan.
B000007UTN|5.0|this album is almost undesirable the first time i heard this i was like well i have to buy this every song takes you on a musical journey and doesnt hold back if you stare long enouh while listening to this you will see a unicorn no lie

B005MWK9JS|5.0|I very much enjoyed the movie! The graphics was amazing and effects was awesome. The story will draw you in to the adventure of how, why, and when everything really started.
B007MDB71O|5.0|One of the great movies,  I had a lot of fun watching this.<br /><br />The DVD is well made and has some great extras that allow you to get a feel for what went on behind the scenes.<br /><br />I'm hoping for a series of John Carter's, you can see they used this movie to set up a lot of plots for the future.  It would be a shame not to see this play out.<br /><br />Enjoy!!
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|This is my second or third time watching this movie. I purchased DVD after seeing it in the theater's. Im sure will watch it many more times. Story line is a reallty good one. Written by Nicholas Sparks. Gifted girl going through a rough patch after parents divorce. Gives up playing music. Goes to visit father in another state,  meets boy going through some troubled times as well. Fall in love with boy. Falls back in love with music. Faces some discriminiation. Repairs broken relationship with father. A bit of tears as usual in Sparks movies, but the story is poignant and touching. Definately would recommend this movie.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This movie is for people who were kids when Raiders of the Lost Ark came out.We were raised on quality as kids and now we're old. This movie is like Raiders grown up, its like us. It works on every level, its nearly perfect. We were raised on The Empire Strikes Back we were raised on Lucas, on one Spielberg movie after another- this movie hearkens back to that golden age of our youth. EXCELLENT in every way.Stimulating, challenging, surprising, inspiring!
0307408833|1.0|I purchased this book because I suffer from Celiac Disease and thought it might offer some good alternatives to my current recipes. I have been baking and cooking for 30 years and I have never had this much trouble with recipes. The frosting is difficult to make following the instructions as written (I finally used my VitaMix to make it work)and when I did make it work it tasted waxy like artificial cream filling. The cupcakes tasted salty when I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies were more cake like than cookie. When making the \\"Cinnamon Toastie\\" there was an unpleasant aftertaste of baking powder. Several of the recipes have a raw bean taste because of the flours that are used. I went to their website to see if I could get some advice and I found that many other people were having the same issues. The kicker is that the people who answer the blog are no help at all and their replies border on rude. One person asked if they could use nut milk instead of soy milk and the reply was \\" Well you can try it.\\" Save your money on the book because you will spend a small fortune trying to make something edible using this book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener is a great little sharpener. My husband has bought sharpener's in the past, all the fancy 3 sided, diamond cut etc... all have been much bigger than this. This sharpens anything we have and works better then most of the others. Easy to hold easy to use. Great price and small enough to carry in a pack. My teen daughter ca even use it. I had to order another one because my husband stole mine for his hunting pack. I would recommend it to anyone, if you have a young one wanting to learn to sharpen a knife, it will be easy for them to hold and control.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I like how well organized it is for how inexpensive it was.  It so easy to customize the catagories.  Every element of keeping a general file on a bill or payment is there.  I love using it.
0345803507|3.0|After resisting the advertising-hype barrage I finally weakened and picked up this third volume in the trilogy. Big mistake. I now know I'm not really interested in Chick Porn.<br /> This book reads like it was written for pre-teens. Maybe the fact that I read and review mostly non-fiction and biography makes me unable to appreciate the finer points of this chick fiction/porn? It simply does not ring true. It's like a fairy tale where the prince carries off the heroine to his castle and they live happily ever after--seldom venturing far from the pleasures and pains of their castle's dungeon.<br /> The plot resembles a preteen's dreams of romance. The girl waits anxiously for her prince to arrive with his yacht and servants to sweep her into his strong arms and take her away to a life of leisure and eternal happiness.<br /> As I was reading the beginning of the book, the characters forming in my mind's eye weren't as described in the text. Mr. Grey was clearly an Aristotle Onassis type and Mrs. Grey was a very naive Jackie Kennedy who was marrying the richest tycoon she could find to demonstrate her independence from the Kennedy family and to have a man she felt she could totally control. He was buying a status symbol, trophy wife, but she was eye candy with brain and Aristotle probably never knew what hit him. There was a book written about her throwing away of her new husband's money called \\"The Twenty Million Dollar Honeymoon.\\"<br /> The events and location and trappings described in the book also seem unreal--like the author was basing them on Vanity Fair magazine stories. The BDSM scenes actually seem much more real than the general plot. However, as a man, I couldn't vouch for the feelings of ecstasy experienced by Mrs. Grey during her various mind-blowing, head board rocking S & M experiences. But there is something wrong with an almost 600 page book when only the sex scenes seem like they might actually be real--like something the author had actually experienced and not just fantasized about.<br /> The author's descriptions of her husband being totally in love with his bride to the point of nausea throughout the book was like something out of Oprah when Jerry Springer might be closer to the truth.<br /> It was interesting to see how Mrs. Grey seemed to be successfully making the role change from a bottom to a top at the end of the book. That's certainly progress. And the end result of this trilogy is certain to be the spark that heats up the sex life of many couples--kinky, BDSM fetishes are going mainstream even in prudish America.ced and not just fantasized about.<br /> The author's descriptions of her husband being totally in love with his bride to the point of nausea throughout the book was like something out of Oprah when Jerry Springer might be closer to the truth.<br /> It was interesting to see how Mrs. Grey seemed to be successfully making the role change from a bottom to a top at the end of the book.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|For me personally, the last time I was excited about a Beach Boys release was WAY back in 1985 when the self-titled \\"Beach Boys\\" album was released. That album was the first without Dennis...and it was an OK album overall. Some great tunes mixed with songs that were fair at best. NOT THIS ONE !  The new album is EXCELLENT, I give it an \\"A\\" for a grade. Out of the 12 songs I would say that 9 of them are outstanding...and 3 are 'OK'. I love this album and give credit to Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce, and David...along with Jeff Foskett and the gang, for releasing probably one of the best albums of their 50 year career !!! Yeah...it's THAT good !! anyway, enough of reading this...get off your butt and get out and get it today ! You won't be sorry...it's that album for the summer of 2012....and for your life....Peace.
B006M7JCC2|1.0|This book is DISGUSTING. It gives false hope to those who read it, and leads them away from the Truth.  We are warned repeatedly in the Bible about false prophets, and this is a blatant example of it.<br /><br />Also, even if you were to take God out of this debate....how can you believe that Adolph Hitler is/was composed of pure love??? Come on people - use the mind the good Lord blessed you with!  If you are searching for answers, open up a Bible - it's ALL in there!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|If you haven't started reading this series, don't bother.  It is not just over the top with the sex scenes but it is not even believable.  I was getting so tired of the sex that I was skipping pages.  Not sure why I didn't put it down but I should have taken some friend's advice and not bothered to read all the books.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is cute and fun. I bought this app for my kids but I play it more. Love this game.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't know...maybe it's just me, but I truly don't understand any of the rave reviews.  I was determined to finish this book about the very dark and disturbing places in one marriage because of those rave reviews, but reading it was so exhausting, sort of like trying to run or jog through a deep and muddy swamp. Getting to the end, finally, left me angry because of the waste of my time. The characters are, without exception, unbelievable and/or thoroughly unlikable - without complexities.  Alternating voice chapters usually are a clever way to build suspense, advance a plot, fill in blanks and give texture and insight to characters, but not in this book. Here, it was confusing and provided no insight, since it was all a con anyway.
B000SZH66S|5.0|It's a great CD. It was recommended by my fiance. It's like the doors with a soulful, bluesy, female singer.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a great love story and some really steamy sex. I really enjoyed the books. You can't just read one you have to read them all right in a row!!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Lana Del Rey's Born to Die CD has been my favorite CD for the summer of 2012.<br />This is a stunning debut from a very talented singer/songwriter.  Lana's music<br />channels the passion of Amy Winehouse, Fiona Apple and the late Donna Summer . Born to Die is a mix of various musical styles and Lana performs them all with polish and integrity. This CD is NEVER boring. Her sultry voice is like liquid velvet.  She has a great future ahead of her.  Her videos are also 5 star!  National Anthem video is unbelievable. Thank you Lana for the outrageous and totally fun \\"Born to Die\\".
B005HESDSK|5.0|I always like the ones were technology does something unexpected, and this is about as unexpected as it can get.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about reading this book after looking at a few of the bad reviews but decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! I devoured this book on one day. Absolutely loved the friendship and eventually the relationship between Abby (Pigeon) and Travis wish I could find I have been trying to find books that I enjoyed as much as this book!
B00881VLCE|5.0|my kids love this app as much as i do. lots of puzzles available and you determine the difficulty. the only thing that would make it better would be the option to lock the puzzle into place.

B007T2XC7A|2.0|I've always thought that people at the top of their game should branch out and try other things, and in this regard I salute Norah. Her soothing, accessible jazzy croons are unequaled, and it is nice that she at times ventures into country music, with results that are acceptable.<br /><br />So now if Norah wants to experiment she should take up archery or search for the Higgs Boson or something. Norah is no Alanis Morissette, and her attempts at tearful bitterness and heated vengeance result in hackneyed rhyming patterns and monotonous melodies.<br /><br />I admire you for your effort, Norah, and I hope the process was cathartic. But this one didn't quite come together, so channel your impressive creativity down another avenue next time. And feed us fans another one of your traditional albums once in a while as we cheer you on.
034580404X|1.0|This must be the most boring banal trilogy I have ever read. I kept reading as I thought it must change soon  everyone is raving about these books so I kept going. Awful waste of money and time .

B0052VUNHC|1.0|I read the reviews, and was excited to read this book. Now that I've read it, I am happy I only paid $2.99. I have never written a review before, but felt it was important this time: the book is no good. I don't understand why it is on the top of the best sellers list. The characters have no depth, and there is no real story here. And nothing happens! There is no reason to care about the characters, because they are flat and boring. The story is boring and unrealistic. Save yourself the time and money and pass on this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The entire series was not what I was expecting. There were some scenes that I think some people might blush over, but in the end, it was still amazing! I was very pleased and would recommend it to anyone!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game has great graphics.  It is fun to see your city taking shape! My seven year old son likes to play it too.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Three volumes of less than mediocre writing.  I am embarrassed that I purchased one of these  books.  The same descriptives used repeatedly...he ran his finger along her jaw...she blushed...she bit her lower lip...he ran his fingers through his hair...!  In the last chapter of Grey III the author is still using the same lines...check out pages 511 and 529.  Boring...lacking creativity.....however she has an amazing ability to make money. I'm sorry she has any of mine.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I'm a 11 year old girl and i could totally understand the book. If you could'nt understand it then that means you're dumber than a 11 year old. it made me wanna read on and on and on. i couldnt stop. i thought the second book was way better than the first. this book sorta reminds m of the hunger games. how cassia was like katniss. ky was like peeta. and xander was like gale. i cant wait for the thid book.
B006LSZECO|1.0|To be truthful, I didn't read the whole book, I skimmed it.  The beginning was slow and tedious.  The writing kept going from present to past and between two characters.  This is not a writing style I enjoy.<br />I was determined to get to the end, so kept paging forward on my Kindle and reading when some new piece of information seemed to be presented and truly wish I had just given up.  The characters had no redeemable qualities and were just sick and twisted.<br />I will not read another book by this author.  I can't fathom the mind that creates such appalling, repugnant characters, much less writes about them.
0606259090|1.0|I previously thought I received an edited version of these books that left out any quality writing until I read the other reviews. Now I realize that I am not the only one that is missing the awe of this trilogy. After much coaxing from friends I actually read all three of them (well, I skipped through the repetitious parts..umm, like 75% of the book) and I still don't get it! Are you serious???!!! This is a best seller???
0812981448|5.0|This book was a great read and I would recommend this for anyone that wants to make a difference but doesn't know how or where to start.  Blake has such a heart for servicing others and I hope to influence others in the same way some day.  Not only is this book inspiring, it also contains a reader's guide with discussion questions.  I read this book with a group of my co-workers and found these questions very helpful in starting conversation and discussion.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|No spoilers! Cross my heart!<br />I am apprehensive about writing this review. This will be my third attempt at creating a review in which isn't angry word vomit in which I have thrust unto an unsuspecting Amazon buyer. However, I have some things that I feel said buyer might want to know before they subject themselves to this absolutely horrible book.<br /><br />The first thing that irks me is that fact that this book is for young adults. Suzanne Collins gave the series, what I find to be a very dark and disturbing premise in which I find to be borderline, unsuitable for the age group in which this series was directed. My fear is that Collins also realized this and attempted to dull down the gritty horrors, which would have made this last book amazing. Yet, she couldn't take all of the death away, that just wouldn't be fair would it? No. Collins then proceeded to slaughter characters for no specific reason. If somebody is going to die (no saying who) the author must provide a sufficient explanation of both how they died and the aftermath of their passing. I do not appreciate a character that had good character development being killed off and then everybody being like \\"Well ______ is dead, oh well! Let's keep going.\\"  Not okay folks! I was livid to say the least.  Then there was a little problem that the two main characters, Katniss and Peeta, were both incoherent throughout 99% of this book. I'm sorry but isn't the entire reason the reader has continued to read this series is to find out what happens to Katniss and Peeta? If I'm mistaken I would love to hear why you are rejecting reality. Add to that a horrendous, anticlimactic plot and the fact that the Katniss, Gale, Peeta love triangle was resolved in the epilogue is unacceptable!<br /><br />Much like stopping Marley and Me before the dog dies because we all know what's going to happen, turn away now, remember the love you felt for the other two books, for this book is the metaphorical death of the Hunger Games.
B007SGM084|1.0|Harlequin romance with lots of sex and bondage.  Not even well written.  Being a \\"submissive\\" does not do anything to contribute to women's equality - maybe if the characters had been switched I could like it.  Even the story line is unbelievable.  I like a good story with my porn.
B007DX39XW|2.0|THIS IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE AND ANYONE COULD GET THIS FOR $150 SO DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!! BUT DO NOT GET ME WRONG IT IS A VERY NICE TOY AND SOMEWHAT INGENIUS PERHAPS YOU SHOULD MAKE THE A LITTLE BIT LOWER AND YOU WILL! GET MORE CUSTOMERS BUT THE FIRST PERSON IS KIN DA RIGHT
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this game is awesome.if u dont like this game u dont know how to have fun.the thing about this app is spidermans voice.
B00846REIS|1.0|Ok, so I download this book bcuz I read reviews about how much it resembled Fifty Shades of Grey (which I am a huge fan of btw) and I wanted to see for myself how much alike it really was. I was completely blown away with just the first few chapters. I thought I was reading the reject version of Fifty Shades. Gideon said the same things as Christen (\\"Did he now\\", \\"Do you now\\", \\" Your mine, \\"I need you\\", \\"I need control\\"). The author tried to make it a little different by makin Eva have the grey eyes and and Gideon have the blue eyes and Eva having a sexy gay roommate with green eyes- go figure. The only real difference was, Eva was a lot weaker and forth comin with Gideon than Ana was wit Christen and that made it worse in my opinion, at least Ana had little back bone, which I liked. Bottom line I would never recommend this book bcuz there was no originality and if you are a big fan of Fifty Shades, you would look at this book (Bared to you) as an insult.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the idea behind the game but the graphics are poor.  Games are also not very responsive to touch making them difficult.

B003ELOQD4|3.0|The U2 360 show did not come to Philadelphia. I heard the stadiums were too small. Looking at this video, I can see the stage would have been a tight fit. It must have been a great show. It is a shame that the video does not transport me into the action, but the editing in this production is too jerky. When I watch a concert, rock or classical does not matter because it's about the music, I tend to watch each musician play his special passage. So if it's Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or Put on Your Boots my eyes follow the musical action, passage by passage through the piece. The editing in U2 360 does not do any of this, it jumps around about every three seconds, which also happens to be the attention span of a rat. I don't know who decided to do the post production like this, but he has no musical talent.<br /><br />Oh, and the music was hard to understand. The soundtrack was muddled. After the first viewing, I discovered the default soundtrack was \\"PCM stereo\\". I thought Bluray was supposed to be smart enough to sense your audio setup and put out the right mix. When I changed the soundtrack to \\"DTS Master Audio HD\\", I heard the music with greater clarity.<br /><br />So this video has been a disappointment, all the worse because it looks like it was a great show. I wish I had been there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read hundreds of books a year and struggle to find books that are well written and worth the time to read. This is one that is both, well written and a great read. I highly recommend it. Far better written than much of the new science fiction.

0345803485|1.0|The authors composition is so trite and abashed that it leaves nothing to the imagination, which leads me to believe it was written by a desperate teenager.<br /><br />If you're horny, you might as well read erotic fan fiction on the internet for **FREE** instead of dropping $10 on this mind numbing slop.<br /><br />Amy Sedaris could write a sexier book than this piece of trash.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I love women who read, it's a turn on! And there's nothing wrong with erotic romance novels in general, yet if I ever fall witness to a lovely lady reading this sexist 'novel' I would tell her that most salient men would find it more alluring if she decided to use it as mulch... Fifty shades of mulch.<br /><br />Note: Do NOT purchase this book if you need mulch.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Why do we stop reading the Bible? Everyone that I know has red a verse or more from the Bible but I only know a hand full that continues to read the word of God over and over again. So why do we ever stop? The word of God keeps us refreshed and filled with Gods love, mercy, and grace. The Bible is a reminder of how all things began, a guide of how everything and everyone should be,  and most importantly it is a message from God to us men and women all around the world that this life on earth is only for a little while, so how we live it determines where we will be for eternity. I don't know about u but I want to be saved so I'm going to keep on reading the word of God so I don't forget what was, what is, and what is yet to come. Thank u Jesus for your mercy and love.
0316078913|3.0|I absolutely LOVED his other book, Me Talk Pretty One Day and laughed out loud the entire time I was reading it!<br /><br />Naturally, I thought Holidays on Ice would be of the same caliber, but it was a little bit of a letdown. His opening story about working as an elf at Macy's was absolutely HILARIOUS, but the stories that followed seemed to be progressively less and less funny. Several stories had very little, if anything at all, to do with Christmas so I really don't understand how this book even really qualifies as a holiday anthology to start with.<br /><br />I'm not saying the book was bad, because it wasn't. You might buy it and it might be right up your alley. I read the whole book cover to cover and mostly enjoyed it and had a few quiet chuckles, however it just didn't have that laugh-out-loud quality that his other books have.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I am glad I waited to read a review and write one before I was completely finished with the book. I don't know how to feel. The book was good, maybe even great. However, it was not phenomenal like the other two books. This book made me mad and happy at the same time. Which is where the mix feelings come from. I loved how Katniss found her own voice in the mix of the districts rebelling. But I truly hated how many things that could go wrong went wrong.<br />---------------------------------------------Spoiler Alert---------You have been warned------------------------------<br />First of all I hated how Finnick had to die. And I really hated how Prim was killed. I mean the whole book started on Katniss trying to save Prim and she is killed off immediately when you think that the murders couldn't get any worse.  I wish we had gotten to see Katniss and Peeta fall back in love as he gained his memory back rather than have them speed it up into the final pages. I wish we could have gotten a better story into the lives of Petta and Katniss before the trilogy officially ended. Other than those slight problems, I can conclude that the book was great. But not phenomenal. I think the book could have ended better...but its whatever, i suppose. The viewing says 4 I think it is a 3.5
B0050XFY4O|1.0|You'd think in a movie about incest between two half brothers, you'd get loads of conflict and obstacles.<br /><br />Not so much.<br /><br />Honestly, they could've been next door neighbors with how no one ever confronts them about their relationship. I'm not even kidding. They act as if it's entirely normal in public and not one person asks them about it or ever and they never seem to feel like there's anything wrong with it, which is why I'm not entirely sure why it matters that they're related. And even when the one father and the mother worry about it, neither or them ever approach the kids about it so it's all pretty much a wasted opportunity in the conflict and character development department. Neither character really overcomes anything or changes because they're fine with their relationship in the beginning and fine with it by the end.<br /><br />Game of Thrones handles an incestuous relationship ten million times more interestingly than this does.<br /><br />Also, everyone seems to think their chemistry is great but I completely disagree. I've seen better chemistry between actors playing gay characters on soap operas. These guys are kind of awkward to watch.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The book is not at all what the hype makes it out to be. The story is about a naive college student introduced to BDSM by billionaire with a tortured soul. It could have been a good story, but the author has no skill whatsover. The characters lack depth, the words and scenes are repetetive, and there is no conclusion. If you intend on reading this only for sexual content you will be disappointed, sex scenes consists of Anastasia biting her lip and being touched \\"down there\\" or feeling a sensation in her \\"sex.\\"<br /><br />I dont recommend this to anyone.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was so amazing I couldn't put it down. If you would like to read a beautiful love story with all of excitement read this Book and point of retreat!!!!!!! Great book
B0071MV540|2.0|Good first half for a summer movie. Good characters. The heist itself is simply too preposterous--EVEN for a summer escapist movie. Just wanted the last third to end.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|David Mahmet created an excellent script for the cast of this movie and their ability to provide us with brilliant acting is evident throughought the production. Pacino, Lemmon, Harris, Arkin, Spacey and Baldwin give Oscar material and pull us through every human emotion. You are literally on the edge watching Glengarry Glen Ross and mentally exhausted at the  close of the film.
B007NESBK2|5.0|You know, this is what it's about; a straight-up, top-notch, professional production. This was way more than just a concert, this was a major show. I surprised my wife with great seats, and two+ hours later, we walked out of there saying that was the best concert we've seen, period. Understand, we've been fans since day one, but never had the opportunity to see her in concert. The band is still as tight as ever, and the light show, cameras, silohuettes, ah, what a performance. Oh wait, I'm talking about the show we went to...well, that's my point. We put the disc in, turned out the lights, and as soon as Sade and band started rising up from the stage, my wife jumped out of her chair screaming, and it was on! The one thing that made the blu-ray better than the concert was I got to see that pretty face up close, and crystal clear on my large plasma.<br /><br />Great concert, great blu-ray disc..if you're a fan, you can't go wrong.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|Hilarious from the start. I was dying after 2 minutes. Ice Cube does a surprisingly good job as a supporting character. Tatum and Hill seem to have good chemistry and give above average performances. Funny movie.
B007H1HQW0|4.0|i tried every other method, the yarn and burn method, the score and heat method, now i have a straight easy cutter that actually works. this makes it incredibly easy to score a straight easy line that actually works. you still have to separate the glass by some other means, including heat and chill method, but it is much easier to do this way than with the yarn and burn method. comes with easy to understand instructions and very easy to assemble.
B0086DBE62|4.0|This is kind of an odd film. A number of reviewers have covered the ways in which a well-known fairy tale has been retold. To me, the draw of the film isn't so much that it's a version of Snow White, but rather that it's a quirky re-telling of a fairy tale. There is just enough humor and just enough odd scenes that it keeps your attention. Even the settings are kind of strange. They are a mix of medieval and fantasy. Nathan Lane and Julia Roberts make for a very engaging and comical pairing. The seven dwarfs are played by well-known short actors and are very quirky but funny. This movie seems like it will delve into some cruel or violent scenes, but somehow it manages to always pull back enough not to spoil things. When I started watching the movie it seemed like something from out in left field. By the time I was done, I had been entertained by something just different enough to keep my attention.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You need to read all three books to get the whole story which was amazing.  Didn't want to put down each book.  I wanted more after reading the last book and hoping there's another trilogy in the work.
030758836X|4.0|Grabs you from the first page AND is really well written. This is a delicious read, not pretentious or intellectual just fun and full of twists and turns that are impossible to predict. The end could have been tighter but essentially all else is great.
B00846REIS|5.0|A book I read after reading the 50 Shades of Grey (Trilogy).  Similiar in reading and enjoying Gideon.  I can't wait for October for the 2nd book.  I wish I didn't have to wait for October and December for the 3rd book.
B0061S073A|5.0|Great App to keep kids in their place! My grandson uses my kindle fire all the time and loves the interaction with the book apps. This keeps him out of my books and apps. Great tool to download.
B00846TTDG|5.0|The action is awesome, authentic and real.  I was impressed, stunned and I have a new found appreciation for the military.  It's a damn good movie.  So much so that this is my first review about anything on Amazon, I felt compelled to tell  you that this a damn good movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|hello I am world famous game reviewer, Wendy White. temple run is a fun game to play for fun, but I think it should have some kind of structure.maybe they should let you go inside the temple and actually take the idol, instead of you just tapping on it to start!! tell me what u think.. label your review, Wendy White if you want me to take a look!! :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing,  mmy new favorite series. This series ducks you in from page one and keeps you hooked to the last page wanting more.  Recommend it to your friends as these books bring up a lot of fun and good conversations of what could happen next. So looking foreward to more in this series and hopefully a visit back to solo 17 And more on 18.  This series is defeniatly just what the what I had been missing a series with devolped characters you start to care about and empathis with once you pick it up you wont put it down.
B000002KNU|5.0|Talking Heads is my favorite American band. They have had such a career and written so much good music, that it is almost unfair to single out their first album as their best, but that's simply the case. What stands out in 77 is  the unity, the arc of the music, that plays like a single uninterrupted track, 30+ minutes of fresh, richly textured music. Not to be snobbish, but the famous Psycho Killer may very well be the weakest track of the album (perhaps because it's such a warhorse that it has become hard to appreciate its originality).
B00002N9ER|3.0|glossy, feels kind of cheap but seems to hold up, would prefer a matte black, great for D-cell maglites, i personally use these brackets in my trucks, you never know when you'll need a flashlight so keeping it handy for safety is good.
1594481717|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but I noticed that the top review of this book is a one-star rating, which I think is unfortunate because it's an excellent book.  Personally, I found it very engaging and thought-provoking.  The ideas were so exciting to me that I couldn't put the book down, even though I was disturbing my husband who was trying to sleep beside me.<br /><br />To me, the main point of this book is that it's an interesting hypothesis about how currently emerging trends may play out in the workplace of tomorrow.  The key word here being hypothesis, not a proven fact.  Unlike the other reviewer, I don't think it needs to be stated that this is the author's opinion.  It's fairly obvious that something that hasn't happened yet can only be a theory, since no one can provide evidence or hard data for something that is yet to occur.  It would just be bad writing if authors had to write \\"I think,\\" or \\"I believe,\\" or \\"in my opinion\\" before every sentence.<br /><br />On the other hand, I do think the subtitle about how right-brainers will \\"rule\\" the future may have been a mistake.  It implies an us vs. them controversy that may make some people feel defensive, when in actuality, the book is mostly about how everyone can better develop their right-brained skills.<br /><br />This book had a lot of influence on me in deciding to find ways to develop my creativity and other right-brained skills.  Regardless of whether Pink is right about the future, I had a lot of fun thinking about his theories and playing around with the suggestions and exercises!
B003XYE7R2|5.0|This book was assigned to me for summer homework and I thought it was going to boring like every other summer homework book but it was actually the most exiting summer homework book ill probably ever read.
0061766089|5.0|I was new to design thinking, so that Brown's book has had great impact on me. Before I read this book my idea as for design was somewhat warped and restricted. Brown has expanded a lot my concept of design from a very limited escope to a broad systematic view. I am, however, surprised to see so many negative reviews which belie the true value of the above book. In my view, Change by Design is an excellent book.
B000IY03DM|3.0|Just found this fantastic mix of voices last fall. Listen to their music most everyday while I work in my studio. Have a ticket to see them in LV next week. AS to  the Siempre CD, the choice of music is not my favorite. Ancora 2006 & their Christmas Collection 2005 are THE BEST. Awaiting their newest album, coming soon. This group has hit the jackpot in life! Very uplifting for me to hum along.
B002U3CBZM|4.0|The story is set in a future where death is not always the end thanks to technology which allows the user to be &#34;re-sleeved&#34;. The plot involves an ex soldier who is pulled out of virtual jail and brought to earth to help a rich man find out why he appears to have committed suicide. The characters and world are well drawn and the main gripe I had was a difficulty with the principle character's reality. It is hard to square the conditioned , almost robotic hired killer with his bouts of conscience. I also did not enjoy the fight scenes which could be a bit drawn out. There are elements too that are a bit too realistically created! Sometimes you prefer not to be that drawn in. On the whole though this is an excellent sci fi novel, a genre I used to enjoy as a child but normally now don't bother with. It usually fails for me as I can't quite get involved enough in the story. Here, however, I had no problem with suspending reality and believing in the new world drawn, therefore this is well done.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome and really addicting. Occasionally it freezes up and you die, but not very often. It is so much fun and it kept me occupied for a 4 and a half hour drive. I love it and so does my 7 and 10 year old sisters. My 12 year old cousin likes it and my 11 year old cousin likes it. Actually everyone I know likes it!!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|How can this not be at 5? I have read this book a dozen times, and watched every version of the movie. This is the epitome of regency romance, the bedrock on which they all are based. The story of Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy is a classic, this one you must read. Told a few hundred years ago,it's magic endures. What a feat to write a book still loved so long afterwards. If you have never read this, then a great treat is in store. If you have, well do so again. And its free on kindle. What is not to like?!
B004KBSQBA|4.0|Not ever having purchased \\"Gracelands\\",whether it be vinyl or CD,I am more than impressed by this digitally remastered work of Paul Simon.<br />It is my experience that GOOD music is hard to come by in this generation,but this 1986 album is superb.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Once I started reading this series, I couldnt put the books down. I'd heard good and bad, the bad mostly about projecting a low image of women. However, if you look at these books for what they are, fiction, and take all the seriousness out of the picture they're thoroughly enjoyable! You will get wrapped into their world, wanting your own Christian, and spicing up your own love life!<br /><br />I LOVED how the ending was seeing thru his eyes! I would TOTALLY be interested in a 4th book (or 5th, lol) thats from Christian's pov so we can see what he was thinking in all of this!! Im sad that Im done with them and plan to re-read them.....NOW!!
B007N8RULO|3.0|this game is more fun than regular solitaire and is pretty fast paced. it has ads but is worth the time.
0345803485|5.0|I loved the book, but then I am an escapist. I agree with the four stars and all the many people who have rushed out to buy books 2 and 3 because they loved book 1. I fell in love with Christian and I think Anna is adorable. Of course it is fantasy but that is what fiction is. Also, writers have a right to place geography, characters, and anything else in any light, position, etc... they want to, if they are indeed writing fiction.<br /><br />I was sad to see all the cynicism spewing from the two reviews I read. I personally have had some of those mindblowers those ladies were doubting. I guess everyone hasn't. Furthermore, Christian is often working in the book. I also know a couple of great looking multi-millionaires who give lots of money to researching and helping in third world countries.  Why is this so unbelievable? His age is the one stretch. But hey, it is fiction and they are an adorable couple. And which one of us would not absolutely love to be one of them.<br /><br />I give it a \\"great job and a wonderful fantasy\\"
B0052VUNHC|2.0|This is the first review I have ever written. I am an avid reader and can devour a book in a day or two at most. Frankly I was out of reading material and looking for something interesting, and the favorable reviews for this book caught my eye. Boy do I feel like a sucker!! I probably would have soaked this book up if I were still in high school. I can't imagine any other 40 year old enjoying this book! And the relationship in this book is just f'ed up. That's the only way to describe it!! These 2 people are so codependent on each other...the fact that other people see this as a beautiful love story speaks volumes to me on the number of unhealthy relationships that there are today. No wonder the divorce rate is so high!!!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Was I the only one that thought that this trilogy was just stupid? The writing was juvenile and rife with redundant phrasing, there were a ton of distracting typos and it was just plain repetitive and boring, the telling of this story could have been accomplished in one book, there was no need for three ($). I got through them because I told a girlfriend that I would otherwise I would have dumped it halfway through the first. If that's your cup of tea, I am sure there is far better erotica out there for you. 50 Shades was pure drivel.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Connelly delivers a solid case with The Last Coyote. True to form, Connelly's plot twists leave the reader guessing as the suspect list is whittled down.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game for kids<br />...mine love it<br />get it for kids... its like farmville for kids. and it was free to make it even better
B003L77FYS|5.0|Love the program and we love having the complete series to watch over and over.  We received terrific service and the DVDs are in great shape.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|This book contained the characters and the setting of Austen's original but none of the wit, elegance or inteligence.  The characters were lifeless and the mystery pedestrian.  I was so disappointed at how little interaction Elizabeth had with her sister, Jane, and her husband, Darcy.  I would  not recommend spending time on this book
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok I didn't find it interesting but you do see nd play some interesting. but you do have a lot of games to play I guess that's the whole concept of the app

1250006341|5.0|I purchased this for my husband because his loves this series.  I rate it first class. The photos are all from the series, but the book goes into much more detail about this era in history - from the styles and customs, to the interaction between the classes.  It is very well written & entertaining.
0807014273|5.0|nt: \\"This book was recommended to me, by a man that I respect. Every time I read Viktor E. Frankl's, Man's Search For Meaning, I find that I need time to reflect on what I have read, often even after just a paragraph. What evils have been brought on humans, by other humans with the lame excuses that they feel superior? Dr. Frankl writes: \\"From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two--the \\"race\\" of the decent man and the \\"race\\" of the indecent man\\". I am so glad that I read this book.<br /><br />A professor asked our class asked who each would be more inclined to follow Sigmund Freud, or, Abraham Maslow. Thinking out-loud, I suggested Viktor E. Frankl. The professor however stated, that he was out of scope of that particular assignment. Whereas I am a layman at best, and to be frank, I have great respect for Maslow's Hierarchy of needs, I am just not a fan of Freud. As for Viktor E. Frankl? G-d love the man. Well, really, with the forward looking Logotherapy, G-d love the man.<br /><br />Dr. Frankl writes: \\"It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life - daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\\" [Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search For Meaning (p.122)]<br /><br />Best regards.<br /><br />Doug\\"

B000F8DB4O|5.0|Listening to this cd is like taking a vacation without leaving town is the best way I can describe 'We Live Here'. I bought this 3 years ago from Amazon, heard it on the radio, called in and asked which cd it was from and found out I had it already. That's when you know you have too much music, and yet lately this one has risen to 'top-listening status' quickly. 'To The End Of The World' is hands-down one of PMG's best tracks ever.
B005DR64OQ|1.0|Trespass is such a corny and utterly boring film and it's a thriller!? I will say that Nicole Kidman looks absoultely stunning in this film! She hasn't looked this pulled together in a decade and her performance is pretty solid even though the writing and plot is thin and sloppy. As for Nicholas Cage, geez he is a trainwreck here! I don't know what's happened to his acting lately but this guy needs to tone it down, like seriously! He overacts in every scene, this man used to be one of my favorite actors (anyone remember Leaving Las Vegas?), but he just can't seem to control his crazy antics anymore and it's very sad. Trepass is the biggest waste of time, skip it!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Had to do everything in my power to keep reading this book...It was extremely boring, the first half was so slow the send half was a little better, but I do not recommend this book for people who like intense mystery...bored to tears....
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Just what I need it . A simple app to keep track of my bill . Simple to use.Thanks .
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I actually picked up this paperback in costco one day. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down. It was amazing! And I even got angry when I couldn't go out and get the second book &lt;-- seriously not joking about that either.<br />I am totally recommending this book to anyone who likes sy-fy and mysteries. I'm a mix of it myself, but this book was totally awesome! Even have the next one on pre-order
0439023513|3.0|I had hoped that following the padding that was \\"Catching Fire\\" I would find some fire in \\"Mockingjay\\" but I didn't.<br /><br />Katniss becomes, if possible, more selfish and more whiny.  Gale and Petra continues to be strung along like teenage girls waiting to be picked by a popular boy. Katniss is a puppet in the games of others, she is not a hero, she is not strong. Her selfish choices kills people who, for some unfathomable reason, love her. She is a terrible example for young women.<br /><br />I would give it 2 1/2 stars simply because as other said I liked this book. Liked it enough that I couldn't stop reading because I wanted to know what happened.  Unfortunately it felt like the author gave up, just ended it in a few pages. Thoroughly disappointing and rushed ending.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Season 5 if my favorite season of Dexter;  it is a show with women characters that  I can relate to. In defense of Deb and comments addressing her \\"potty mouth\\" and \\"why does she get men considering she is so sweet;\\" thank God we don't have another driveling,sweet Ally McBeal character to watch on television. Deb is one of the most interesting white-woman characters on TV right now (not counting GOT- its already a fantasy).  I am tired of dependant, sexpot, sweet women who can't function on their own without having a total meltdown and chase after a man the entire season (like BOTH leading women characters on HBO's The Newsroom are doing right now).<br /><br />Lumen's story line is amazing and I am glad she did what she did. The narrative of Lumen's vengeance over forgiveness model is rarely applied to women who are raped by men and I appreciate that this show addresses rape in ways we haven't seen on television. Season 5 acknowledging that rapists are worthy of Dexter's attention even though it took Dexter awhile to get on board. As in most rape narratives, Dexter wants Lumen to go home and put it all behind her.  Always such hollow advice-- that Lumen doesn't take in my favorite episode, \\"Everything is illuminated\\" she begins the journey to redemption on her own terms.  The show didn't write Lumen as a mentally-ill, man-hating, revenge-seeking witch, which is another thing I really appreciate about her.  The show stays true to the theme, that violence has real and painful consequences, and that good people turn bad when they are reborn out of blood.
B006S053K8|2.0|This movie seemed like it was a made for television flick filmed in the 80's. The plot just dragged along, the characters were fairly unapproachable in my opinion, and really, i just felt bored through most of it. The billing with the SNL cast and such was a bit misleading, since instead of being a comedy, it was a depressing drama. I literally walked away for a while to make dinner, came back, and found I really had not missed anything. There were a few good moments, but overall, i felt this movie was really just a waste of my time personally. Maybe if I felt some deep seeded depression about life and relationships I would feel different? Dont know, but I do know this movie wasnt for me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is fun and interesting at first but then it just gets boring. it was amazing for a day then I deleted it because it just seemed useless.

B0015DROBO|5.0|My only complain is its slow start. Much like Jeffery Deaver, the author weaves a complicated story, but makes it easy to follow and turns where you never expected them. The american movie did do the book justice.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this is the best since ea sports made Nba jam and madden 12 and tiger woods pga tour really good game must get worth money
0345803485|3.0|I must confess, I bought this book because of all the hype about it. \\"Mommy porn\\", etc... Although I'm not a Mom, I thought this might be something hot and sexy to read. Wrong! The sex scenes were all the same, and got to the point where I wanted to skip reading them all together. I can't believe that people get turned on by this? Unreal! I've read other reviews on here where people have said they were tired of hearing about her \\"inner goddess\\", and \\"subconscious\\", which she mentioned all the time throughout the book. I found it unique and different to write a book this way. It didn't really bother me. What did bother me is Ana saying \\"Oh\\" all the time. It was almost laughable. She literally says it on every page. Either way, I think the book was an easy read, and was entertaining none the less. Ana & Christian seem to have a lot of attraction and passion for one another, so that spoke more to me than all the vanilla sex throughout the book. My suggestion to people considering reading the book is: Buy the 1st one like I did, see if you like it, and if you do, buy the other two. I myself will not be purchasing the other two books, but I will say it's not as bad as some people have said. But nor is it worthy of 5 stars either (in my humble opinion). Happy reading! :)
B00006FM77|5.0|Replacing vinyl with CD's has not always been easy.  Chicago's CTA, II, and III were easy.  Those CD's are everywhere.  The best I could do with Chicago IV was a cassette version from way back.  This album (CD) records a series of concerts in New York's Carnegie Hall back in the days when the band was still rockin' it.  Before the pop, when Peter Cetera was still part of the ensemble (not the whole band), and Terry Kath was still a huge reason for their rock roots.  The music is great!  Everything you'll want to hear from I, II, and III is here, but LIVE with all the flaws that one would expect from a concert recorded from the early 70's.  I saw this show in San Diego at the Sports Aroma.  CD brought back those memories of what a great show that we witnessed.  CD is boxed like an album with four discs, all with separate jackets and album inserts included.  CD is an album based concert event for those who loved and remembered the \\"old\\" Chicago.  Once I got it on my i-pod, I made it its own playlist just so I could hear the \\"concert\\" whenever I wanted.

B0081L37Z0|3.0|Not a bad buddy cop flick. Jonah Hill looks weird skinny(er) and Channing Tatum really surprises with decent acting for once. Its got some funny parts but the best thing about it is that the movie knows what it is. Recycled. And it embraces it making for a funny self aware experience. It's worth a rent for sure.
B0067R0APK|5.0|the gui is attractive and clean. the map is great. good hourly data.  it's easy to find data i need.<br />my favorite app on kindly fire.
B0088TG252|4.0|This movie was good. Not the usual good for Denzel, but still good. This may have also been one of the best performances I have ever seen from Ryan Reynolds. Seriously, he was really good this time. The movie lags in a couple parts but the rest of it is the white knuckle thriller you paid to see. Maybe not worth a buy, but hands down worth the rent!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is fantastic. I have selected the version of the Bible that I would like to read and it gives you the option of how long you would like to take to read it.

0307949486|4.0|Enter, the recently disgraced financial journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, who has just been convicted of libeling a heavy weight financier, Hans-Erik Wennerstr&ouml;m, and faces a hefty sum and three months in the slammers at Rullåker. His rapidly deteriorating career begins to turn around when he is approached by the the prominent industrialist Henrik of Vanger Industries as one last resort to unravel the mystery surrounding his great niece's, Harriet Vanger, disappearance over forty years ago. In return, Vanger will provide Blomkvist with damaging information against Wennerstr&ouml;m.<br /><br />Blomkvist agrees, albeit reluctantly and skeptically. For one year he'll be on Hedby Island while he goes about the business of the investigation, and scrutinizing the alibis of those of the Vanger clan that were on the island on the day Harriet had gone missing, as Henrik is convinced that one or more amongst his family is responsible.<br /><br />Blomkvist goes under the cover story of ghost writing the Vanger family chronicle. He's aided by the title character Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo. Salander is a social ward of the state, she's antisocial, has no urge what so ever to submit willingly to authority and is covered with an assortment of tattoos along with piercings to complete the gothic ensemble. She also happens to be a genius hacker who prefers to dish out her own brand of justice and revenge upon those vile and ruthless users and abusers that crawl on the face of the earth, whom she despises with a passion to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Together they delve into the depths of the Vanger family's past until they find themselves very close to cracking this mystery open when someone begins to threaten them to get lost and keep away. Despite the looming danger, they proceed to finally discover the events that lead to Harriet Vanger's disappearance and possibly her death.<br /><br />When I'd first picked up The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo I didn't know what really to expect, I mean I've read the blurb but the genre of crime fiction is relatively new to me. In the beginning, where it was elaborated how Blomkvist had landed himself in this spot was confusing to me mainly because of all of this financial mumbo-jumbo, so most likely readers savvy in this field are more comfortable here but I believe I got the gist of the situation after reading certain parts till my head hurt and finally putting in down for a short while before resuming.<br /><br />The characters, on the most part, are believable and were three dimensional. Now I'll zoom in a bit on Lisbeth Salander. Lisbeth is a truly intriguing personality; she's distant and wants little to do with anyone else unless she really has to. Her general behaviour and intense dislike to abusers leads me to believe that she had suffered at the hands of one herself in her past. She won't take nonsense lying down and her survivor's spirit is one of the reasons why I admire her. There is something ... something I can almost place my finger upon what that makes me so eager to learn more about her.<br /><br />We learn of certain family members' involvement with the Nazis during the Second WW and a little about Henrik Vanger's stay in war time Germany. I thought this particularly interesting because I'm partial to even fictional accounts during that time in history.<br /><br />I found this book surprisingly violent, with certain parts that had thrown me a little off balance but I had the feeling I'd better get used to it. I should have taken a hint to the snippets of statistics of abuse of women in Sweden, because it's of the themes later identified.<br /><br />The fact that I had to put down and pick it up again numerous times before I got around page 270 to really get hooked, is the reason why I gave this book 4 stars. I know that lots of books start off by stretching and yawning before they finally pick up substantial speed but for me 200 and something pages is too much.<br/><br />With that being said, overall The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo is a book truly worth reading and frankly if someone had told me it happened in reality I would stare in utter fascination and, at the same time, horror but nevertheless I would eventually believe him because the plot is believable. Who knows what dark secrets those huge empires quietly sweep under the carpet? How many women had suffered such unimaginably gruesome torture, with their screams that go unheard? This just makes me wonder.With that being said, overall The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo is a book truly worth reading and frankly if someone had told me it happened in reality I would stare in utter fascination and, at the same time, horror but nevertheless I would eventually believe him because the plot is believable.

Second, it has many edits it's not thye orginal and it looks like someone with a steady hand video taped it while it was palying from VHS. It's homemade. It's not even worth the money. Don't trust this seller. Horrible quality.

Unfortunately the characters they are playing are rather flat and not particularly charismatic. The laughs are few and far between but fortunately there is enough snappy dialogue to keep you interested. It's all very predictable and not as funny as it could have been, but it's still worth a watch because it is quite a pleasant film. It's just that it should have been much better.
B0079R8IYW|1.0|This product does NOT fit the Kindle Fire! It is also very thin and would provide little to no protection of the device.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|really fun! I only have a K.F. which means this is the only version I can get. I DO have the utopia update and I can't wait until the next update.
0131177052|5.0|Mr. Feathers outdoes himself in his latest book. The gripping story of legacy code as it ties into work-oriented frameworks shows his complete mastery of the art of suspense. The intricate plot with the incredible surprise ending didn't fail to deliver. If only more authors of texts on legacy code would take the time to intricately plot things; as things stand Mr. Feathers certainly does not face any real competition in the battle for legacy code maintenance in this engrossing roman a clef of the down-and-dirty world of software engineers and the hangers-on, groupies, drug dealers, pimps and security people that surround them and turn their lives into the sort of surreal mirror of twisted reality that one usually finds in a David Lynch film.<br /><br />I feel it only a matter of time until Hollywood makes a movie based on the book, and I certainly look forward to it.<br /><br />Buy it, read it, re-read it. A truly engrossing suspenseful masterpiece; Dijkstra, Jackson, Hoare, and Wirth have nothing on Feathers. I could not stop turning pages and stayed up all night until I had finished it; I still reel from the surprise ending and how my view of reality has forever changed. Functions? Imperatives? Pre-conditions? Post-conditions? Objects? None? All? Read the book and find out.<br /><br />Clearly destined for the sort of immortal fame reserved for the true superstars of the world of legacy code (and code legacy), I hope the reclusive Mr. Feathers continues to create these masterpieces of intricately plotted and sexually dark transcendent works of maintenance programming.
B004UID2LC|5.0|only one simple flaw... IT FORCE CLOSES TOO MUCH! but aside from... did I mention updating deletes all your data on the app? aside from that this app is perfect.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My boys love the Rio movie and were excited when I got this game for them and even more excited when we unlocked the levels with the monkeys. Needless to say, the combination of Angry Birds and the monkeys has made this an instant favorite.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Availability of different versions and reading plans make it great! I need the reminders. And did I mention it's FREE!
B005T87QCI|3.0|The graphics are really nice as my sons like this movie so it was a good purchase from that standpoint. They want to be able to use other robots and it's hard for them to win. I'll be honest, I will knock down the other robots sometimes three times and then they hit me twice and I'm knocked out??<br /><br />The controls are a little lacking as there is sometimes a delay. I hit the gloves up and nothing happens and then you get smashed in the face. It's okay, not exactly what I had hoped.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|i like it and it is fun to play when i am bored at home and yeah there are a lot of games
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|An excellent read for all sci-fi fans.  Let your imagination run riot as you visualize the bizarre characters and scenes.[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]]

1878424505|4.0|Reading this book brought back years past knowledge and reminded me of important issues I'd forgotten or misplaced within my spiritual identity.
B008764ZQ4|1.0|My mom bought this for my son. I listened to it before he did. I only liked the 2 songs that Mary J. Blige and Catherine Zeta-Jones sang mostly on.
1591840562|5.0|The book itself came in great condition and ahead of when I anticipated delivery.  The actual content is an Entrepreneurs Blueprint and just reads easily.  After I read the novel, I found myself checking out some of Guy Kawasaki's lectures on YouTube strictly because he knows his stuff and makes the difficult seem manageable.  I highly recommend for any aspiring entrepreneurs!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was hooked on this book in a matter of minutes. I enjoyed the twists and turms the plot took, fell in love with the characters and didn't want to stop reading! Fantasic summer read! Defintely a MUST!
B00785P2QC|4.0|the game is a great way to keep busy and is challenging to a point, but you have to spend money just to progress far with invest points because of the way the game works. the only drawback to such a good game
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|does exactly what I need it to do.  I use it for drug calculations and to double check my math.
034580404X|5.0|These books are incredibly addicting, I couldn't put them down. As soon as I finished one, I was on to the next! They will leave you wanting more!! Such a romantic storyline, it keeps you on your toes and guessing! A definite MUST-HAVE!
B0058YPG2K|5.0|I am a HUGE Breaking Bad fan and purchase every season on DVD as soon as they're each released.  It's a great show and I'm disappointed that it will be ending soon.
