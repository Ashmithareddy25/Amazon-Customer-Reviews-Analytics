B0001L0DFA|4|So far so good.....
B00MBPTH56|5|Great alternative to steel wool; excellent for restoring finish to brushed stainless steel.
B00GCB0X7G|5|These are really good quality grips. A bit pricey but &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.
B000FOUB8M|5|Good buy works like they stated.
B0015FYQ90|5|Perfect!
B00P1N8QU2|4|Wow, these towels feel much thicker than my previous ones from the auto store.  I haven't washed any yet so I'm anxious to see how they hold up after a few cycles.  I'm giving four stars because I received 35 towels instead of 36.  I counted multiple times and my count remained 35, not a huge deal but hey, that's one more towel I could have had.  Overall I'll probably end up ordering more once the time calls for it.
B00EKTILNU|5|perfect
B00029JOE2|5|Great quality ...fast shipment
B002Q2VM0W|5|Amazing
B004ZF3FJO|5|Headlights came as advertised and arrived ahead of schedule.  Installation is a breeze if you have a general knowledge of cars and installing electronics.  No worries if you don't, its 2015;  google and youtube can help guide you through anything.  Only been a few days, but haven't had any issues.  Works flawlessly.  Highly recommend.  3,000+ good reviews can't be wrong.
B012CW6N2W|5|These look really nice on our Ram 2500 - Very easy to install..
B00BTL9A8C|3|not quite as dense and heavy duty as the original but fit well
B004D0HNUS|5|It fit perfect on my 2002 Ford F-350, if anyone is hesitant to buy this starter just do it, it is amazing how easy it starts the powerstroke. No complaints so far.
B000EDUUIA|5|Works great!
B001IX6ACA|5|Effortless to change and definitely has a nice note to it when accelerating... 5 stars!
B00XTYS5Q0|2|I goofed and misunderstood the dimensions: these are ridiculously small.  Amazon should put them next to a ruler for the photo on the site. Had I understood the specs, I would not have purchased them.
B003CH3Z8W|5|works well
B00DRYOOIA|5|OH my, these shock absorbers are AWESOME!  I have a 2008 Dodge Ram 2500 with the 6.7 Cummins.  Lots of weight on the front from such a big engine and these shocks handle every pound of it.  I first ordered and installed a pair for the front suspension, now it's time to get a pair for the rear suspension.  If you are considering replacing your shocks, these are the ones look no further.
B001NLVNT2|4|1 set is installed and working so far (have something else on the other side).  I tested both ballasts and 1 bulb and they work.  The other bulb was damaged during shipping and a replacement is on the way.  The bulb color is accurate, warmup period is as expected.  Time will tell if it's durable.<br /><br />The ballasts have changed though so  you may or may not get the exact item that is pictured (their ad states you get the exact product pictured).  The round black plastic cap on the ballast in between the bulb cable and power plugin is no longer there on some shipments.  It is very likely that this is a different product inside and/or Zenex has a different supplier.<br /><br />update aug 2017.<br />amazingly, 2 full years later and everything is still working as it should.  not much color shift, still fires on first try, no flicker, no notable output loss.  installed in exposed offroad lighting, parked outside, cold Alaskan winters, super wet the rest of the year.  The -1 star is for receiving a broken bulb which was replaced.
B0000AVZMU|5|love it
B000E4OK3K|3|A couple of weeks ago I bought the driver's side mirror and it was a genuine GM part.  A few days later I ordered this passenger side mirror by the GM part number and not realizing it was not genuine GM.  The driver's mirror is bright and shiny black and this passenger mirror is dull and looks very faded.  Also the driver's mirror is much heavier weight.  No comparison.  I would have paid the extra money to get the real thing.  I realize it is a truck and it is old but I am very disappointed in the quality of this mirror.  I hope it will last.
B005PJJ89U|5|Accurate tire pressure gauge.<br /><br />Can store your cars front and rear psi recommendations for easy lookup when checking pressures.<br /><br />Good value.
B00HE1C5MO|5|Exactly what I needed and easy to swap out.
B00B6X7PGM|5|What a great product.  For the price of a decent rebuild kit, and a couple hours of your time, you can buy a brand new carburetor that fits as the original one did.  Comes with new gaskets, plate, and bots to button it all up. Adjusted spot on, right out of the box.  If you need a carb, this brand should be first choice.  No alterations needed.  Just be sure, to order the right carb, because each one may look the same as you need, but small details count.  Such as the fuel line fitting being in the correct place,and facing the way you need it to. I may buy a couple for other application, if the have replacements for what I want them for. NOTE: If your in an area where your fuel has ethanol, like 10%. Be sure to replace your old fuel line, with parts store hose rated for E10 gasoline.  Otherwise, in as little as six months, it will eat the fuel line. Power equipment was not made,and is not made, for E10 fuel.  Leaks, can be dangerous, and also hard to spot.  Good day friends. Michael
B00XISOJ2G|5|They fit perfectly and were easy to install
B00U11YWJ8|4|Emblems come with a saw-string to remove your old badges, unfortunately the string snapped on the front badge.  Fishing wire worked just fine in that case.  Looks awesome!
B0080HJL7S|5|I am a neat and organization freak. Our SUV is no exception to my cleaning and organizing ways! Me and my husband often go on road trips for different reasons: hospital trips, travels (business and otherwise), road trips, vacation, visiting family members that live out of state, etc. This Car Trash and Litter Bag works best for me and it makes the neat/organization freak in me very, very happy! It takes up no space in the car and it's very easy to use, install and clean out! It is made of a very sturdy canvass/material - so y'all will be using it for a very long time! It is also very easy to open and close the lids! Two thumbs up for this product from Rhino Car Gear!<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

B00390BS7C|5|High quality, heavy item. Worked perfectly to replace my O2 sensors.
B000BO913C|5|I used this to stick my rain visors to my truck and it worked very well. It held it up without fail.
B00KVESGWO|3|Great stuff,been using it in all my Dodge diesels..Never leave home without it...Helps in extreme cold,hot temps and helps if you get dirty diesel as some stations have...
B00LUZIDN0|5|Best present ever.
B0017ZGMIQ|5|nice
B000BAT8TS|5|I'm very satisfied with the Product ,Product is exactly as described<br />Great seller! Fast shipping.Great price and Quality product.<br />Loved the item.Will buy from this seller again
B000COCTWG|1|Upside down cannon plug, which inverts the high/low diffusion pattern, which inverts the high/low switch and indicator.  Do not buy if you want your high/low switch logic to be correct.
B00CXYVKKA|5|This is the second decal we have purchased. The other one was ruined in an auto accident.  Everyone laughs when they see it. Nice decal. Like the humor.
B000BODTS0|4|it will work for me
B00YY7M4AO|5|The OBD scanner works great. I inspect  failures on vehicles for extended warranty. Using it daily so far so good.
B002KCWWFC|5|Very greasy, good stuff
B00K9WYDV6|5|Works great
B008GW2N86|1|I purchased these from carid.  They have a 90 day warranty.  After about 4 months, part of the small reflector around the bulb melted and is now rolling around inside the light.  Same thing happened with the other side.  This is a design defect.  Don't buy spyder lights.
B001DKT0DO|5|Excellent mirrors. I love the fact they are adjustable. Make sure that you figure out where to stick those. Once stuck it is very difficult to pull those out.
B001GJ3FIS|5|Does a good job.
B00OW0NQGE|3|Exactly as advertised.  Two rings with one detachable for car key/valet service and attractive.  Did add more bulk to the already sizable stuff on my key ring and added to the lump in my pants pocket.  Ended up detached and languishing in my desk drawer.
B00AWYBI50|5|Looks good on my civic and easy installation,  couldn't ask for more for the price
B00Y5EVDAI|1|Not worth the money, it did not fit my Rx8 at all. It was oversize, and even if I tried to trim it it would not work.
B00480J4KA|5|Good product fast shippi g
B00JTF0YF8|5|Great, Great Box for the money!!!  This is the second one I have purchased over the years. One for my ST1100 and now my Tiger 955i.  Make sure to also buy the inner liner, it is very nice and really makes the box inside look good. The Outer box on this model is close to as nice as a Givi but it is the lock that is hokey.  Works fine but you must use key each time to open and close which is a pain. For a hundred bucks it is the best thing going!!
B00817XAG0|1|Poor quality. Waste of money. Poor customer service.
B00P9OF04I|4|I was a sceptic about this product. I knew it would take a miracle to get the ugly yellow stain off my headlights. I used this product on both headlights and within an hour both were clear and shining. Do they look brand new? Not quite, but I can actually see thru the plastic cover again. I was ashamed of them until now. This photo was taken after allowing the product treatment to sit over night. I used about three coats of the cleaning solution and a little elbow grease. After applying the top coat, I witnessed an immediate shine. The price is higher then I would like, but the outcome is very nice. I am pleased. I hope it lasts.
B00HLK77YO|3|Works but really flimsy construction. I doubt it will last through the cold Saskatchewan winter
B00I8U2B2E|5|get a lot of compliments on it. easy to install
B0054T95ZS|4|Went on fine, look good, and have a solid connection. They will require fitting to get a good connection with most batteries. Best way is to stick them on as far as they will go, tighten them up a little, and use a rubber mallet to seat them fully. The metal on them will bend a little too easily though, so I'd be careful with them.
B0068ODC66|2|Stopped working after 4 months-and i only drive it twice a week, so im a little disapoointed.
B00V3JSDA6|4|Buttons needed to be programmed; the programmer told me the Panic button does not and will not work on any aftermarket key fobs he has ever seen. He attempted several times to make it work it is not seen by the programming tool. I gave it Four stars because it was less expensing than an OEM key fob, but wished the Panic feature worked.
B004VROJ32|3|When I first bought this it was awesome.  I could give my hand a break on long drives, and then after eleven months it breaks.  To me it seems to have become brittle after time and cracked.  This crack prevents it from gripping anymore.
B00CMWDRHM|5|as described
B002935IV2|4|worked well
B00R5778OW|5|Perfect Fit
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works awesome! The extra material on the sides helps block out more sun!
B001UL4ALS|5|Works great, worth every penny.
B001DKT0DO|5|Great price. Mirrors pivot and the sticky pad on back is very sticky. Highly recommend.
B00F2QPTK8|4|Decent shade. Keeps truck cooler, fits well in windshield. Akward to fold and store..
B0019I9SV4|3|The holes had to be modified to fit the pipe.  It was not a perfect fit.
B00BV6V4Y8|5|Great price for a heavy chain.
B00NF1SK1M|5|A recommended upgrade. I suffer from allergies and this filter seems to really help. The inside of the truck stays much cleaner. No longer does dust settle everywhere.
B00NURLDP6|1|Size was way too small for my scooter seat. The velcro tabs that hold the seat cover onto the seat were very cheap and tear off easily.
B009OFAGL0|1|I didn't realize the extent to which you have to go to install these pieces. Had I know, I would not have purchased them.
B0092ZWDNG|5|Love it. Fits in the windshield very well & definitely does keep your car cooler. A bit awkward to roll up & store, but I think that's because its made of sturdier materials. The Velcro tabs to hold it rolled up are a plus compared to the elastic of the cheaper store bought brands.  A warning - if you have a chip in your windshield it could contribute to the chip becoming a crack due to the heat reflection of the sunshade. Happened to me.
B00EZ9BYCA|5|Works great
B003BZQ9DI|5|Worked as intended - in a lot of the reviews for hood pins there was discussion on finish flaking or rusting.  These have been installed for 6 weeks or so and so far there is no sign of issues with the finish.  Fully satisfied.  I don't recall getting fasteners for the scratch protection discs.  I used 1/8&#34; pop rivets with the proper grip range for the hood.
B00AN5RX20|5|Perfect Kit for my 2009 Ford F150 4.6L 3V. Highly recommended  for anyone wanting to upgrade your stopping ability.  Super easy installation. Would have liked stainless steel hoses added to the kit.
B000MS5T42|5|Get this instead of the slotted coupler.  I could only get the slotted coupler to work half the time. Whereas this 90 clips on to the grease fitting just as the coupler on your grease gun would.
B008OVJYFE|5|Great part for the money.
B00CPGQ2DG|5|Works as expected
B00652G4TS|5|Firstrate car monitor works on 1996 car.
B00EPA7CZC|2|On was just empty socket
B000COB8DW|5|Good source of light. Brighter then standard issue headlights and decently priced
B00WYRL1VY|5|Excellent product fast shipping
B00OACBR7Y|5|Our son loved this on his 30th birthday suprise party :)
B00OBGQUVM|5|There were no instructions in English?
B006MX8196|1|Only worked for front seats and head rest covers are too big
B00IBMPF5Y|4|not as easy as the hood strong arm on my jeep to install but they work very good...
B001DCF6IA|5|Works as expected. Pretty easy and quick to change. Works well.
B008RTMG5S|1|Fell apart within a week
B00QVM28QK|5|Great job, as advertised, fast shipping, great EBayer*****.
B00701EIRS|5|I got this as a gift and it really worked well.
B003JLLPOW|5|Very nicely made bag, and easy to attach to my Aprilia Shiver with the included bungee system.  The bag is just right for carrying rain gear or a few item from the store.
B00RUEDN12|5|Item as described perfect fit good quality. Would be better if the gasket was black though.
B003VTOGQG|5|The Ancra tiedowns are a bit more expensive than the generic stuff found in discount stores, but well worth the extra cost.  The locks are very secure, but easy to release.
B007JMOSAA|4|Fits well over my BadLands 12000 pound winch but has started to fade already.  I guess it is better to have the cover take the beating of the sun instead of the winch but still I would think it would stay black longer.
B000J2NYUM|5|Good quality! Fast Ship!
B0031ZDU62|5|My truck has over 200k on it.  During the ownership I've had this go out about three times.  I've always used the $125 Motorcraft part.  These are so easy to change, I thought I'd try these.  I'm several months out and I haven't had any troubles with these.  And if I do, I've got seven more to work with for a fraction of the price of just one.  I definitely recommend these.
B004EW99J8|5|Exceeded my expectations.<br />Especially as a city dweller.
B00II8HHP2|5|Exactly as stated. Easy to install and look great!
B008OLGUF6|5|Works terrific, the only issue is that because it is soft, you can't put anything on it. That said, because it is soft, it wraps up into a very small space and allows you to put lots in the cargo space, especially with the back seats folded down.
B000GOG3PG|5|worked great
B004ZF39OA|5|Bought them installed them used them until got rid of the car 3 years no problems nice lights
B00G4L23PY|5|VERY VERY VERY bright. I need them for an old car so i could drive at night :) Works perfectly. Definitely a BIG difference.
B008MXZB4M|1|This is not a U.S. Army Transportation Corp Insignia. The photo I have attached is.
B007N6IUR4|5|Looks good. Fast delivery.
B000MD4YKM|5|Great product for the money. Heavy duty gun.
B009YH5VL8|4|Fits fine quality good, it says it comes with all hardware for install the only bolts it comes with are the  ones that hold the y pipe on
B00COYLEFA|5|This stuff really is magic,its totally made for their lsd.<br />Compared to other oils out there,it does keep the noise and grinding sounds to a minimum.<br />Wont use anything else!
B00752TRP0|5|Schumacher Sp3 Automatic Battery maintainer is great for maintain my car battery
B00TFZNF5S|2|They Stick Out As Much As They Do In The Picture.And Their Stick Ons They Don't Look Look As Secure As They Should Be.
B00VXONPMC|5|Bombardier parts great price
B00CTLGSZO|3|It is handy for backing however it was harder to mount then I expected and the first time we  had to re-route it as the cable was not long enough for my extended cab full size bed pickup. Also, although it does give an adequate picture, the screen is smaller then I was expecting for my tired old eyes.
B00UM9UCE8|5|Great cabin air filter.
B00029XC1I|3|Its Ok but a bit over priced, saw same quality item at wally world for have the price.
B00ARBHY5Q|4|It fits the rear axle castle nut on my 2009 Kawasaki Concours perfectly.
B00UVXDIS2|5|Love this. Goes with my other decals of minions. Not hard to install. Was a first time decal person. Worked amazing.
B009WE8VYC|2|was disappointed that the screws that were included did not fit the product.  I read this in a couple other reviews and ignored the fact, my mistake.  Make sure the screws fit prior to putting it on you bike and if not send it back!.  Shame on Kuryakyn for such poor product quality and design.
B00192HPOC|5|Perfect fit, wooks great!
B004I5O5EU|4|Placed these on a 1990 Ford Ranger. Ordered on 22 July, shipped on the 28th delivered on Aug 3rd. Not bad for interior Alaska. Packaged well. The old lights had yellowed fluted lenses and rusted reflectors; might as well had two candles. The new lights have flat very clear lenses and the reflectors resemble modern vehicles or something akin to Hella 1000's. The passenger side bolted right in, the alignment pin on the drivers side was a little misshaped for the hole in the fender; no worries as the new frames are plastic I just took my pocket knife and rounded the corners and it went right in. The clips that the screws go in on the new lights are to large for the old screws; just swap them with the old ones and your good. Total install time (using a cordless drill) no more than a half hour. Just be careful removing the parking light and attached trim the clips that hold the bottom in hold well. I used an old 1 inch wood chisel between the finder and the trim to pry them loose after removing the top screw. Only problem now is the rest of the truck needs a cleaning. Never mind I see a couple of mud holes.
B00TOLYU48|5|Ordered this bike carrier and just used it to carry bikes from NJ to WI. Very happy with it. Took just minutes to install, solid construction and easy hook-up. The fold-down feature works well, making it easy to open the rear hatch on our crossover, and access luggage while the bikes were still mounted. Materials are good quality. Overall very happy with how it operates and the price is right!
B00HZSNV4C|5|This bug removal solution truly is amazing! We read about it in one of our RV magazines and it sounded too good to be true.  We thought we'd give it a try after hours of scrubbing the windshield and front of our motor home when we returned from a trip where we hit a swarm of bees and other insects.  It really did the trick and easily tackled that nasty job!
B00NL2RAC0|3|Pros: Looks good and feels good gives seats good look and protection.<br /><br />Cons: No idea why a black set of seat covers comes with tan straps with brown writing on them really stands out. Also the back of them are tan so in places where the back is visible like the headrest it really stands out should have been black. Every time we get out of the car they have to be readjusted.<br /><br />I can deal with the adjusting of the cover because they are universal and I understand I'm not getting perfect fit, but the one thing that has driven me nuts is the tan straps with brown Chinese writing just stands out so much. I am going to dye the straps black so hopefully this will correct the issue and stop drawing my eye to the tan.
B00GIHSHN6|5|I've mounted this to a Jeep JKUR and it is BRIGHT, more than enough light for what I want.  I didn't use the mounts or wiring that came with the light bar though as I had my own already setup.  I did have quite a bit of wind noise and some whistle at higher speeds after installation but a bit of garage door weather stripping along the back in the heat sink fins cleared that up.
B001CECD1W|5|Great.
B00CI2U8M8|1|This product is coming from China!! and they are NOT informing this UPFRONT..
B0048FQ12E|5|Fit perfectly on my 14 mustang...
B005PZMKZI|4|Great for 2001 ford explorer. Not the highest quality but a great value.
B002XM5G70|5|This was a replacement for the Surflow pump that was original equipment in the 1991 Lance pickup camper that I'm fixing up. The old pump worked fine, but was LOUD. Loud to the point that other campers in a family group at a music festival complained, and I couldn't blame them for doing so.<br /><br />This new pump is much, much quieter. Not silent but a huge improvement and well worth the money.<br /><br />Installation was easy. Do note that this is a bypass pump, so an accumulator tank is not needed or recommended.
B0088BX0IM|1|The USB or 12 volt socket did not maintain the charge in my Android phone while using it for GPS.
B001933P68|4|It is just a spacer.  I coupled this with a k&n77 and a larger throttle body from bbk, on 2002 ford expy Eddie Bauer.  It does have&#34;rifling&#34; on interior to cause air to vortex.  Noticed great power gains through outthe range.  Better mpg avg of 3.6
B0054WI7CW|5|No this is the best car tool I've purchased in a very long time!  This item works flawlessly.  The magnet is very strong so once you loosen the drain bolt with your wrench/socket, this tool allows your hands to remain oil free. As you rotate the handle the bolt will spin with ease, even at an angle.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
B002O1JIUG|3|Does not come with the light bulbs.<br />But fit my 2011 ford f-250 perfect
B00IPS3GMI|5|Great price, Great product.  Advanced auto charges $60 if they have it in stock.
B000E2ARGG|5|Great product for a great price. Excellent option at a lower price than OEM but all of the same quality.
B0016GXNC4|5|Used this product in a generator that would start and stop immediately due to water in the gas tank.  This product worked immediately and the generator started and continued to run with no hesitation.
B000CILJGY|5|Nice quality.<br />I'm happier with it than my wife is.<br />lololololol
B000EDUTWM|2|it only has sticky stuff on the edges to hang it up and it doesn`t stay up.
B00MZCCHQQ|2|Just ok too small I would not buy it again
B00BTGDR9A|5|great value
B004940ZNK|5|Installed in less than 30 minutes, works great, way better than old turn signal switch installs. Go to you tube for the instructions.
B001P29O5Y|5|This is one tough built bike rack.  I had a similar bike rack from Yakima a few years ago which got stolen from my garage which I paid almost $300 for it.  It is heavy and well built.  For $111 it's one of the best deals on Amazon.  Excellent purchase and I highly recommend it.
B00BTGSGFK|1|I lightly used six of these and three of the six split on the side in the first wash. Two of the three that weren't split are starting to split and will likely not last through another use.<br /><br />IF YOU'RE GOING TO CHARGE A PREMIUM PRICE, MAKE A PREMIUM PRODUCT!
B006RUJ2D8|5|I didn't think this would work but follow the directions and it work perfect saves so much time will be a repeat customer
B00HLPRAM8|5|Product looks great,, fit perfectly on my 2012 Pilot. Took about 3 hrs to install but completely worth it. Only advice is to not even snug the bolts for the brackets, before putting the running boards on, like the instructions say to. It is much easier just to barely thread the bolts in the holes, install the running board, and then tighten everything down.
B004OZLNE4|5|Great product
B0000AY65X|5|Results were better than expected, used it for the interior where the boat was covered in chalky oxidation. Polished to a glossy finish with little effort. The one-step process is great. Would highly recommend.
B00KXB8EKE|2|I have used this cover twice  both time left a faint black spots like oily hand prints in my car finish ,which is white 2015 z51 ,friend was able to keep put solution on and finally came out the first time,this last time 4 days ago took it to be washed  and washed gut couldn't get this spot out ,rite on the fender
B00029XH0O|5|works good
B003LNJWTI|3|sure they had a chance of being nice but the fitment guide was wrong, so it was a waste of money for me
B003C0173E|5|real nice product built to perform highly recommended !!
B00DCNQ3W6|5|Good quality for the price
B008L5YDM2|5|A different approach to the typical &#34;baby on board&#34; sticker.
B000E2CVW4|5|works
B009LQG5S0|5|Awesome light!!! Super easy to install.
B004XP1TXU|5|excellent replacement
B00RF8ZVS6|2|mine only stays on about 3 minutes ??? whats wronge
B00L94NLIE|5|Works great with the peddle max I could turn it and put it on max on the fly!!! Excellent very create product to purchase it works instantly  on and off .
B001G3ZDO8|5|Fits my 2002 LS430 perfectly. Plus whenever I park my car under the sun, I put this up and no matter how long I leave it there, when I come back, the car is still cool inside.
B003U30IGA|1|Emailed right away when the Master control switch didn't fix the problem; was promised a shipping label would be sent to me and I'm still waiting.  Hopefully, it won't be too late to return this part, since I emailed the problem the DAY after it arrived.  My mechanic installed it and it didn't fix the problem.
B007NQ61LG|5|Arrived earlier than expected. Easy to install. Very good product. Saved me a couple of Benjamins, instead of going through the dealer.
B007JSGR9Y|5|This little unit does what units costing X4 as much! can reset codes after you repair what codes it gets from the auto's computer. Great when looking at a used car to buy.
B0076DID6W|4|Got as a gift for my grandma and it came in the mail super fast. Also was bigger then expect. I also was impressed on how it came with instructions. I totally recommend it.
B00CF5YOW8|5|Great quality...no tailgaters on the highway.
B00VLZ1MXW|1|When I received this item it looked ok, but after installing in the Jetta I noticed several problems....<br />1. The original connector does not latch completely to the stock cable in the car. Seems they are close to the same design, but not enough....<br />2,  After connecting the antenna cable from the car to the base's cable it didn't make any difference in reception. I then removed the unit from the car to troubleshoot, since for the 10 dollars I spent, I didn't want to send back, just wanted to fix the car since I had to wait a week to get this part.<br />So, since it was not working, this led me to believe there was an open in the center conductor wire. (very flimsy). I used my multimeter to check resistance and sure enough it was open. I then took the two screws out of the unit to find the break in the wire. It happened to be inside the unit at the crimp they had internally.<br />I removed the wire from this one and soldered and crimped the original wire from the old base unit I had. Then installed in the car. Worked great then....

B000W0OFZ4|3|U lock is now stuck and will not work. 3 months of normal use, no exposure to diet/grime. WD40 is of no help. It needs to be replaced and I need to be compensated
B00Y3H1QBI|5|Fit and work beautifully. Connections are a bit different, but that doesn't influence operation.
B000C6KM6Y|5|I've used them before. Seem to be just fine.
B002PQW4SI|5|Not much to say other than it fit my '03 Wrangler perfectly and appears to be a high quality item.  Great price!!
B0089LSMSE|5|Genuine Honda Fluid. What else is there to say. I drain a couple of quarts every so often and add some new.

B000C427K0|1|was leaking oil made a mess on my drive way after a month never buying this over price crap going back to fram
B00BQC7JNW|1|It does not have any openings for buttons on knob. Could not use it on my Altima.
B001GAKS8W|5|Live it!  Been using it since 2002.
B00TXVNVBW|3|Just OK not as upscale looking as I want. Not real leather if it is I have seen fake leather look better. Please someone out there make a nicer one and I will buy it. It works well to protect the fob but, a little too big fitting. It does the job.
B00HX2GTBC|5|Absolutely love this cover.....colors and picture is so vibrant!
B008AWDTPS|5|Good price. And fit perfectly.
B005R4L1DE|5|Fast shipping and look great on the truck. Luv them.

B0032DHG2C|5|Installed on my jeep wrangler tj 33s spare. I had to drill a hole which took about 5 minutes.  The investment is secure.
B00JAEL5RE|5|This item is great. Any size smartphone can be held securely. Easy to release and remove. Really holds to the windshield. Great product.
B00KBBL4H6|5|Best gauge I have owned, seals well and easy to read, accurate and consistent as well....
B0002L6ATC|3|fits my mini just fine - big con would be that its flimsy. the edge part torn off the stitching easy while adjusting inside the windshield.
B006MQAXDK|5|Perfect
B00L2I8N6C|5|Just as described perfect fit !
B00W8ADB1K|4|i was hoping that there would be an additional strap to just the top one. my son likes to slide it around with his feet.<br />in general I'm very pleased with it, it does exactly what I intended it for: holding diapers, wipes a change of clothes for both kids and snacks.
B003L35EWM|5|gonna buy more
B004VR5FK8|5|Great bars for the price.
B000E7YP7I|5|Well made and stores flat.  Quickly assembles in about 20 seconds when I need to use it.
B009NLMX8E|5|Perfect fit.
B0002NIK3E|5|Easily fit a to 235x60x16 tire
B00KTW34FM|3|These are very good looking fenders and they are very sturdy once mounted, but the engineering is poor as far as installation goes.  You will reuse your stock fender liners but they will have to be cut.  The instructions included are adequate but look carefully at the pics before cutting your liners.  If you mess up your cut then you are screwed.  Pay special attention to the rear liner cut.  You MUST cut them so you still have the two upper mounts on the liner.  You will just be cutting the depth off but leaving two &#34;loops&#34; to put fasteners back in.  The fenders are mounted using aluminum Rivnuts and stainless bolts.  Terrible combo.  Before you put any in make sure you hold the flare up to the Jeep and mark the holes you need to install Rivnuts in.  You won't use every single hole and they don't give you extra Rivnuts so you can't spare one.  Use an impact wrench to install the Rivnut but MOVE SLOWLY and bump the trigger repeatedly rather than ripping on it.  Stop as soon as you hit resistance.  If you overtighten it then it's trashed and they don't give you extra.  And be careful putting the bolts into the Rivnuts as it is very easy to crossthread the aluminum threads in the Rivnut with the steel bolt.  We put these on for a purpose, not just for looks.  We use our 2013 JK for offroading and with no lift and 33in tires we were rubbing on the stock fenders.  These give us plenty of clearance and they look great. I'm concerned about replacement if we tear one up while offroading but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.  Good product, but questionable installation design.
B008F4N5PA|1|Biggest waste of money. I bought this product at lowes and was painting my cars plastic interior door handles. I sanded them and cleaned them well. After priming them I let them sit for two hours. The primer was not dry at all and made the handle look awful. Save your money and buy a different brand.
B007H2RR78|5|Worth the money,supeditor to any of the others I have tryed.
B0002STSQ2|5|a+++
B004VGAJOG|5|Good products and fast delivery. 5 STARS.

B007R2TSCU|4|It's a very good product. It did what I wanted it to do
B00B788KRO|5|Will order again to make sure I do not run out. I love the stuff! A lot is not required for the room to smell so nice.
B002LCD9XU|4|Looks great on my truck.
B00DHNYERM|5|Perfect
B00CGGXR9C|4|I was excited to get the new Tonneau Cover and it arrived very quickly.  I ordered 572001 as it would fit my 2015 GMC Sierra 2500 Double Cab Standard Bed.  I have had the product on another truck and loved it.  I get the box and it is labeled 572001 so I unpack everything and lay it out in the bed of the truck.  To my dismay it was considerably short.  Upon closer inspection I noticed the model number of the cover was 597601, which is for a Ford F150 Short 5.5 Box.  Not even close....  The product is great but next time I will buy from someone else.  Now I have to go through the hassle of a return.  Very disappointed with Amazon  :( ......
B00QB12QWC|5|Works very well. No surprises.
B000W0KTMW|5|Does stick a little when unlocking but works great. Used some silicone spray and works great
B001V8UKFU|5|Works perfect!
B00K33HJ8U|5|Got this radiator for my 2000 Miata as the old OEM one had cracks and was causing my engine to overheat. The product was delivered on time and with no issues. MAKE NOTE that this radiator is a 2 row and is therefore larger than the original 1 row. Upon installation I had to cut chunks out of my fan housings in order to fit them into the slots. Not a huge issue but something to be aware of.<br /><br />After installation this product works phenomenally, engine temp does not move at all even at high RPM's on a hot Florida day!
B002XLHUQG|5|Excellent addition to my rv accessories. A must have and they make a huge difference in stability while walking around the rv.
B007NGBI0A|5|These boots are very cute! I was worried about ordering shoes online. I have flat feet and shoes tend to rub and leave blisters. I didn't want to spend too much on my first shoe order so, I ordered a used pair in &#34;good&#34; condition for $11. It was $20 after shipping. This is the best buy ever!<br />I've only worn them 3 times but I've gotten several compliments. I love, love, LOVE these boots!
B006FUT09G|5|Recommended by a friend and it is great!
B00DV7FJUA|5|Worked out great
B000GD5FMY|5|Awesome product awesome the price will buy again
B00LJ3TVB6|5|Great  quality  heavy duty extremely happy with  them
B0044AVL8W|5|Original parts for my Toyota celica I'm very satisfied
B004M7LIIA|5|worked great./  Easy install!!
B00DDZCAUC|5|Loved the Island Time Edition emblem.  I placed it on a plastic license plate size blank, and then on the front license holder for my Jeep Grand Cherokee.  (I had to order the license plate holder since it is not required in Florida.  Looks great and is a great conversation piece.
B00DSIIQNO|5|Great product. Works great talk a little bit to install but proforms great
B000NTLKOI|5|Nice replacement
B003WPBG1C|5|This replacement lens was priced fairly and the installation was very easy.  Looks great and I am very satisfied with the purchase.
B000OV9O0M|5|I burned up the motor of a Warn 3000ci winch by stalling the motor and not realizing I was still holding the trigger. I bolted this on instead of buying a $500 new winch. This winch is narrower than today's bigger winches are. On my 04 Polaris Sportsman only one this small will fit.<br /> Easy to do, two or three bolts once I pulled the winch off the atv. Way better option when the rest of the winch is still good. I went through and cleaned all the gears and greased them up really well and now it free-spools better than new.<br /> If you can remove your winch from your atv you can change the motor out. It's that simple. Nothing else is needed! This is an original Warn winch motor. It's high quality and will be reliable.
B0076CLLPI|5|Love it! I'm Sioux so I want to represent. It was very easy to put on and looks great!
B008KV4GCO|4|looks and performs just like the original
B00D29P5CO|5|It is specifically mentioned that these seat covers require removing the headrests.  I purchased them thinking I could remove my headrests.  I could not remove the headrests and was pleasantly surprised that the opening was just large enough to fit over the headrests w/o requiring removal.  The installation video they mention with the package is a nice additional touch.  The video clarifies any questions you might have regarding installing these covers.  I have a Lexus IS-300 and they fit quite well.
B000C5GALG|5|Fits my 1960 dodge pickup like it should.
B00SARRQ70|5|Fits like a glove and looks great...
B00AZMI9EM|1|didnt even work
B005ZFAMA8|5|Fit perfectly and no issues to install.

B000X1Y4JE|5|I sent back the small liner to get a big one it looks great.
B006WEWFMO|5|Awesome quality
B0057FK08A|5|A++
B00173U7D4|5|This is an amazing product! I run a daycare, dies the trick. Everyone loves it and it lasts a good while!
B010JRKQKC|5|Giving this a 5 off of easy installation first and foremost. ..I was intimidated at first to apply myself, but it was just too easy.  Also super sleek style...not the regular plain sets that are way overpriced in your local auto stores.  The price is outstanding...especially compared to $60...what I was quoted at the local big name auto stores.  Super fast shipping.  Came a day early.  Impressed.
B006B21B90|5|Even though the description stated for up to a 2009 model I purchased for my 2013 knowing they have not changed but plastic colors over the years.  Saved me $60 compared to others stating (all years). Installation was super simple, It took longer to drain my factory tank of fuel than installing new tank. In addition, nothing was wrong with the wire support supplied but I easily made some 1/2&#34; thick aluminum brackets as shown on forums. Only negative, did not come with a gas cap vent hose and after seeing several reviews on the plastic gas cap cracking in short time I'll be updating to the aluminum cap with vent soon.
B000OAEJ9O|5|Easy to install
B001EA0LJK|5|Great product!
B0002F68JK|5|Perfect fit
B0038KT546|5|good quality
B000EOR1I6|5|Recently bought this tonneau cover for my 2014 f150 Supercrew so the family can use the bed as trunk space on a renecnt trip. Worked out great. Easy to install, secure and looks good.
B00AQSPG1Y|2|I thought it was going to be like the same tank protector I bought 5 years ago but it sadly wasn't. This l one was a hell of a lot thinner and quickly faded. The quality has gone down severely which makes me sad.
B00BD4YL20|5|love this item
B00FGOU9HY|5|Looks great, easy to install, and came on time. I recommend.
B0007Y5FLI|3|Meter body gasket is bigger and didn't line up. Had to reuse that one. Diaphragm was ok.
B00EDDALK4|5|Worked great on my 08 gmc z71 crew cab!!
B0002YUQ4E|5|Glad you have this product. Works so well on silver.
B009AA17TO|5|Turned out to be as promised: good breaking and no dust or noise. I paired them up with Zimmerman brake discs.
B00IK2MNZK|5|Works perfectly!
B00IUC7MVA|5|Looks great!
B006W2Q306|5|They're easy to stick on and look great!
B0114YWO6S|1|Does not fit 2002 GTI.  The smaller oval plates were not the right size (too big).  Very disappointed !!!!  Also, if you buy these, you need to purchase a hose cap for the water hose.  NO INSTRUCTIONS come with these.
B00S4W17Z8|3|This is pretty good insulation/sound barrier, but I don't give it 5 stars because the price is a little high for what you get and the middle seems to be a standard foam, about 3/16&#34; thick. There are two others on Amazon I feel are a better deal. One is much larger 4'x6' for only about $10 more than this one and the other is thicker (5/16&#34;), has a more reflective foil and slightly larger size than this one. I tested both by hanging them in West facing windows at the peak of summer in So. Nevada and the other one was about 4F lower temp. Doesn't sound like much, but there's a big differnce between how 78F and 82F feels.<br /><br />The only thing this has going for it is has an adhesive on the paper side.
B00WFJ83W6|5|Works just like the original one
B005VUJ2OE|5|Perfect!
B001W6LGGS|1|Camera has no zoom. Cannot dee anything close
B00B79XIQ6|4|the strap is too short and the snaps are a pain
B00TEEW5DI|5|Rexeived on time i as described [[ASIN:B00TEEW5DI Car Trash Bag & Orgenizer By AutoMukoTM Car Garbage Can, with Front and Side Pocket & Tissue Holder - Attach It to Headrest - With One-year Limited Warranty]]
B00W6QRFOU|1|This SUV cover fit the Ford Explorer Sport. But it was cheap. Very thin. Probably would not last outside in the sun long. The bag was a joke. A Von's Baggie would be just as good. Disappointed but you get what you pay for ! It would be good for inside a garage to keep your wax job dust free !
B0059XEM9I|4|It isn't the most easy thing to install and the corners to tend to peel away from whatever you're covering if it's a hot day. But otherwise I like the different look at an affordable cost.
B008JYXYNY|5|Never have to worry of being choked by my seat belt again!<br />Lightning fast shipping!
B00VSHW8UY|5|Love the Acura MDX Crystal Headlights. . . makes my SUV look brand new!
B001G6LI1C|1|Didn't come with an O ring
B004XONSYE|4|Solid construction, good fit, easy to install if you have basic automotive mechanical skills. Quality product. However I have seen no difference in transmission temperature. The increased capacity and cooling tubes do not appear to make any difference in transmission temp for my vehicle at all.
B00LFL8E5G|3|Lasted one week.
B006A1SMEY|5|Great hub assembly , works on my 2009 Dodge avenger
B00393NDZO|1|One of the bulbs has already burnt out after only 2 days of use.<br /><br />They are rather dim as well.<br /><br />They look cool at least.
B00RD982MO|2|Useless .. Not the longest AF but not even like the regular AF , finished after 14 days
B00IO9BM8I|4|Easy enough to install, look good, have better stopping power over stock rotors and pads.  I have had them on about a month and am starting to get some rust on them, which is one of the reasons I replaced the older rotors.  But that being said, I would buy them again for the price.
B001G9BJ5O|4|fit great
B004085D00|5|Will need a new one - wore it out on my laptop.
B00DJ5KEF4|4|Haven't used it yet, but I'm sure it will work great.
B000C9MKBQ|5|Product works great. Just had my mechanic install it and everything is perfect. Bought one for my Cadillac Escalade and Mercedes-Benz CLK500.
B00PSRORH2|5|Super cute! Kids love them! Amazing customer service! The first time we received it, we were missing a couple of suction cups. They sent another package free of cost, everything was great. We are very happy with our window shades!!!!
B006X8B9U8|5|makes vehicle look classy
B00TSU0OX6|5|This is very beautiful! The colors are amazing. It is very bright and very well painted. I have a sister who loves palm trees so this is a perfect gift for her!
B002UCAG46|4|Works just like it says. Water is crystal clear and no unusual tastes. I replaced it 4 weeks ago.
B003L9PTLW|5|They're very good. Just don't put it in the hot dryer cos it shrinks :) Now, I just air dry it after washing!
B000W0RQ8C|5|ggood lock good price
B00IO1JK0S|1|Defective upon receipt.  Didn't work.  Now I have to deal with returning it.
B00HG2UEBA|3|Part arrived as promised,. Part is over priced for an all plastic part.
B002IYBIR0|5|Perfect color match for my GTO
B00NO5NGCM|4|easy to use, matches perfectly.
B00Q62KJDO|1|did not fit..back was too short where it attaches to the seat part.  I had to rip out the seam and add about eight inches of fabric to make it fit.
B00W9UZKOU|5|Great keys! No different than factory keys that say Dodge! Programming easy as 1-2-3! Only wish the remote start button worked with my truck:(
B0042LLB88|1|good price. but battery lost shape and charge after less than one season

B0002SREPY|5|Had to replace a CV joint and I'm glad I bought these ahead of time!
B00CW9JKU8|5|as described
B00K16FPO4|5|Works very well in keeping trim and plastic looking new.  Helps keep the trim and plastic the car supple and reduces sun fading
B004MDEV38|2|The holes were about a quarter inch too close together once I installed the passenger side.  I had to use a grinder to widen the holes on the driver's side about a quarter inch to get the bolts to line up.  I could have returned it but was already in quite a ways to the installation and it was easier to fix myself.
B00B9DEDOQ|4|Handled the muggiest summer month well.
B00KBINF7G|5|Yup it really will start a car.  Haven't tried it on something as large as my truck (V8) but it did start my neighbor’s car (4 Cyl) and only dropped the charge one bar.  My family has used this for all kinds of charging needs while away from civilization.  Works great!
B008VIBTT4|5|Best air freshener!
B0002JMLMY|5|Works well.
B00A93TM8O|5|Nice plate very pleased.
B0013V6M7U|5|My husband LOVES it!  He got two compliments on it at the golf course.

B008Y2EVIS|5|Bel-Ray has always been a great motorcycle oil
B009774GCA|5|Although I wound up not using this, (bad angle) I'm sure it would work in the right application. Good build quality.
B0012TPTDG|5|S&S . need I say more
B0081ZXM88|5|Cheap pricing works great had no issues
B00192JF9U|5|Perfect fit.  Very eash to install
B0067UDL94|2|may be a good product but it was not for this car.
B0066S6W3Y|5|Easy assembly. ell constructed.
B00HLK77YO|4|Maybe not quite as study add oem but seems sturdy enough.  Very easy instalation process.  Check out the videos on YouTube.
B0063HJ776|4|Very good
B0024E6W02|5|Awesome price and  good material
B00W4B4ZPE|5|These both work phenomenally! I had to change the battery in one right away but after that it works just as good as my original. And for $20 each! Cannot beat it.
B009HEP1IQ|4|very good
B001NZQIDE|5|WORKED LIKE A CHARM FOR MY 2002 EXPLORER
B00II5YADC|5|great item
B004L0AC5I|3|Put these on my sissy bar bag and one fell off. Disapointing. One is still on but probably not for long.
B00080QHMM|3|it works in an odd manner....
B003AVUCGS|5|Great bushings
B00SZ2F01E|5|Very easy to install
B007V2EESO|4|fits my 2009 Honda CR-V perfect a little pricy for being so simple but it works
B002LFAP6G|5|Install was easy. Great sound
B009B9PKIS|5|It fitted my RSX very well totally worth the money. Dont waste your money else were.
B00K65KIS8|5|When I got it I had my doubts about it. But when I hooked it up it took a couple days for the computer to change but when it did change I could see the difference immediately my gas mileage doubled but idk about the 100 horse power added
B00XV4EJI6|5|Received on time and as described
B00VWTSNRK|5|great
B00ELJLU3W|5|I need one more.
B0030DM8JK|5|Worked great. Took about 10 min to install two of them on my 2006 pilot. Never did this before. Needed to use a channel lock wrench to slightly adjust them so they lined up.
B00VW1JL6A|5|They are just great and look super I am very happy with them.
B00J5LQRFW|5|So far so good.  Fit perfectly.  Quality seemed to be good.  No noise or play.  Basically what you want out of a bearing.
B00CU8ZEZQ|4|works
B000HKVDKE|4|Happy with the product so far. Pretty easy to install. Like the look of the in channel vents.  Price was good in comparison to other in channel vents.
B00S7OTZWU|5|They worked PERFECTLY... Replaced the handles in the Boat
B0009S85QO|1|I am not even going to give it 1 star I bought this thinking it would perfect for my 18 wheeler.  It blows most of the dirt out the top with filter in place.  Upon inspecting it the &#34;filters&#34; are so thin it is ridiculous to even call them filters.  The hose is so short it is worthless, and what little suction it has is worthless.  Do not buy this is a joke!!!!!!  I will be getting a refund,,
B00D4OHVOW|5|Loving I thanks
B006FSXBE8|5|Perfect fit love it nitro lovers
B008D5JJN8|5|Very nice leather, stitched very tight . Waiting to see how will fit into the new car
B00D9C2CDO|5|We were totally impressed on how strong it is and how much it held .<br />Also it never slipped on our 2bar roof.
B00HOT0NH0|4|great works great
B00VZHZ214|1|glad this was not a gift, did not work at all!!!
B00HJEUUKU|5|excelent product
B003V57NUQ|3|There is already wear on the pads and because I'm using a Thule (round) rack to mount them, they pivot when not loaded w/ the kayaks.
B0014H6AA2|5|Bought these jeep seat covers for my 1993 Cherokee. They are awsome!! Great quality.<br />Great price
B00MBB9YWG|3|Ok i guess holds charge for good time, but after 2 weeks wont power up. One design flaw, uses same port for charging as earphones so cant listen as you recharge on bike
B0002Z9NKG|5|Sounds and works as it should.
B003YK5K9E|5|Haven't had to use it much but have a lifted truck and used to climb into the bed via the tire or jumping and sitting on the tailgate and sometimes getting down the same way.  Great product and easy install.
B00028FB8G|2|item is 4 1/2 mo. old and leaks oil at base or in pump seal.  poor quality control.
B000SBCHCA|5|It worked excellent. I really have not needed it so far. The scanner I purchased has a long cable. I did use it to make sure it worked.
B00B8T1150|3|I've had for about 45 days and one of the suction cups have come off already, like it wasn't glued into its hole properly. I use it every day so if you're looking for something handy for daily use get something a bit more durable.
B001CF5156|4|This product fit well and has a lot of room and lots of pockets..
B008DM8MUW|5|Good quality made connectors at a good price.  Shipping was quick. A++
B00ACOB4YA|1|After 8 months the cover tore
B004J3258O|5|I was able to figure out where everything went, even without instructions. Machine runs great. Quality kit!
B000BLNTQU|5|As long as you check compatibility with your car, you shouldn't have any problems. Sylvania are known for their quality lighting products and this isn't an exception. Worked perfect for my '07 Impala that had a burnt reverse light. Took me five minutes to change (look for tutorials on your car first!).
B010OT6FX2|4|Great organizers for our long trip to Maine. Durable with big pockets! Shipped quick too. Only giving it 4 stars because we had to leave them to air out upon opening because they smelled like moth balls. Smell went away mostly after some febreeze, but icky at first.
B000VPM0CU|5|This overland cover match with the other one ordered a few days before.  I am pleased with the two sheepskin covers.
B000FW2MC2|5|Bought at request for a neighbor.  She bought another and it's a big hit with the school bus drivers!
B00IBMPFTA|5|A+
B000NCOKVU|4|It is awesome, however with time you wiill see the white plastic inserts begin to fail. Then you lose one or 2 or 3 terminals. Sent in for repairs. It cost me over $100 for repairs. Still the best one on the market though
B00DDZL8PK|5|love the art
B00COOS4ZS|1|One of the ballast are not working, it only make noise and the light is not turning on
B00TQ0S7QE|1|Garbage ... dont buy .. screws are cheap .. you wikk need to replace them to keep it from spinning .. yes i said spinning .. bkocks the sensors on my f32 .. garbage
B00N07K5I2|5|Made in USA and looks GREAT!!!
B00ODM4I90|3|Effective yes, but VERY stinky!  DO NOT purchase these with anything else that might pickup the scent.  They REALLY smell of petroleum-based rubber and you will NOT want them indoors for long!
B00GRHRTEU|2|Plus side the Mirrors look great and are well-made. Negative side: an annoying whistle sound while you drive, mirrors stick out too much, and they are not as sturdy as a look!
B0007WJQ6K|5|We love these Tonneau Covers.  We purchased the Lund 95073 for our 2012 F150 (6.5 foot bed) over a year ago.  When we were shopping for another Tonneau for our 2014 F150 (5.5 food bed) I looked at the Lund 95072 and the Tonneau Pro.  We ended up purchasing the Tonneau Pro, because it was cheaper.  The Tonneau Pro made a flapping noise while driving on the interstate so it got returned.  Next time I will know to just buy the Lund to begin with.
B009OBW5XQ|5|Wow! it really does clean, my carpet had big dark soda stains, coffee stains and soda stains on seat. This made my car look new. Check and see what type of carpeting and seat material you have first.
B0030KVA4C|5|good product
B00MX9TBV0|1|Por dressing
B00HV2TP9C|5|Fast shipping. As described.  Thanks!
B006TMK16G|1|Said it was for turbo but was not false description of product. Buyer  beware,
B005H53F46|5|Good
B00T47K604|1|It arrived broken!
B00COOSGBU|1|Everything connected properly with relay and ballast went out in 8 days... Bulbs work wiring kinda long convienent product size just bad reliability.
B00IHAAGAE|5|Helmet strap quick release buckle kit is easy to install and work perfectly. you will not be disappointed with this product.
B00M2MOUK0|5|Works good I just bought this to lift my Polaris razor 1000 and maybe a small car but it looks and operates well
B0006JLU1I|5|installation was easy.  Very nice product!
B000CGHZ8W|3|The bottom base housing plastic would not stay secured with the upper support hold in. There also wasn't any new supply and return fuel line quick release clips provided.
B00KJW98BG|1|Definitely not Ferrari quality. Very faded colors. Looks like it was xeroxed from an original and then printed.
B002JV0W74|5|Perfect fit, keeps the car much cooler. I tested in105 degree southern heat during 10 hour days at work. Tremendous difference. Of course it's not going to be an artic blast but it does what it's designed to do.
B00BTLEJXI|4|Hard to install and company video not really helpful. Used YouTube and figured it out.
B000JWKDOC|5|good product
B001EOWRUW|5|great
B00N8ABU3U|4|Looks good on my truck!
B00BTGDR9A|4|One of the pads shattered on the middle of the door panel. It did not hit any corner. the pad was not hot as well as the panel so i don't know what it just shattered into pieces. Overall they are great pads, they tend to get tinted with the paint of the car your buffing so they kind of change color. Overall it is a good product except for one of mine shattered.
B00DTB4OXG|5|It's beautiful!
B00MP4LX32|5|Great!!
B0026CE6DM|5|Good fit l,easy to install
B00AF5BA6I|5|Fit perfect, snapped right on. Less the 10 seconds to install
B001EOV492|4|Good deal.
B0060HP9FI|5|good fix and product good
B000H7DXBO|4|Good packaging, been holding up, I have purchased this brand for all my smaller batteries, seem to hold up, just be smart about it and make sure you don't have a drain on the system and take care of the machine and the batteries hold up.
B00UW3URP8|4|very unique carbon fiber weave.
B000E0P6UK|5|It was a perfect fit for my Toyota Tacoma 2015. It looks so much better than those accordion ones.  Well worth the money.
B00SZMHT8G|5|Cool
B00XZ9OMAC|4|Nice product but the ability to program yourself is non existent for my Pontiac g6. Taking it to a Chevy dealer to get it programmed was painless and 50 bucks. Still don't see the reason to charge an hour for 2 minutes of work but it's the dealership.
B0024E6V30|5|I use them every month keeps my rv safe and clean
B00857CM8S|5|Awesomeness!
B001W3YBPO|5|They are great!!
B00RII6BHI|5|Totally awesome.
B004GCRNF8|3|The mirror is like a circus mirror and everything is all distorted looking.  Very hard to see with but it was cheap.  Get what you pay for I guess.
B0053SKJAK|5|I have two, one at home, one at the remote garden where there is no power.  They do the job without feeling like they will fall apart on you.  Flow is good and self-sustaining in a gravity feed situation. best one I've found.
B000M5QPSY|5|I have a 6.0 powerstroke and this product makes my truck run great and the additional performace is is incredible I highly recommend this for all Diesel trucks
B008PHIB1A|3|Not wide enough for my 2001 Jeep windshield
B00CH6G0P4|5|Quality product fast shipping and a great price
B00KQEH2V0|5|Perfect for a Saab and has the qualifications unlike Mobil
B002E1B6LK|1|Drivers side on 2015 countryman doesn't fit. Passenger is perfect
B000BVRZ74|5|This stuff really works. Added bonus: the rain streaming off the windows is entertaining.
B000EDQR4Q|5|Works great to contain things in the fridge when traveling!!
B00496RE82|1|This product failed withing the first 5 days of use. It started off strong worked week then died in the middle of a job. I had to go to the local auto parts and purchase one for significantly more money. very disappointing.
B003S0B9EA|1|One of the black clips was missing from the product when delivered, making the product useless. Not sure if poor design or poor handling, but either way it is now just a paper weight.
B00INY5Q6I|1|This product does not fit my jeep Cherokee sport without damaging my new jeep!! I can't find away to contact the seller on here to fix the issue.... It would be nice if someone would contact me to fix the problem then maybe I can rate it better!! Also the box was soaking wet by UPS leaving it in the poori g rain just in my yard. I needed this hitch installed yesterday!!! Frustrated!!
B00KDRXDD6|5|Love my dragonfly. Beautiful yet understated.
B000C1LW0E|5|Used it as an inline supplement to the mechanical fuel pump on my 1949 Cadillac and it works great!
B00332GPOC|1|Didn't fit my 07 Camry, even though it says it does. Had to return!
B00CMX20H4|5|Nice little horn that makes big noise.
B00S3XMSY2|3|The positive thing about this spinner is that it can be positioned right on the steering wheel without screws and can be movied from car to car if you don't use the adheave strip provided for a permanent mounting.  It is okay if you just want to use yhour palm to spin the wheel since it is very shallow mounted and does not give a good finder or hand grip since it does not exteed high off the wheel.  Attractive and does not absorb heat when in the sun so it is a good knob in that respect.
B00K1C1WC2|4|These do exactly what they are suppose to. They go right under the tire and we haven't had any rolling issues and they're nice and light so you can pack a little more of the things you want to bring with. We haven't had any bending or breaking issues and we had them under the camp for a year now. They do end up attracting some spider webs over time though.
B0052FRFEW|4|Purchased handle for a 1995 Camry with a broken door handle. New handle appears to be of good construction, fit to vehicle was spot on. The only hiccup was the yellow locking tab for the door latch connecting rod was on the opposite side of where the car needed it to be. I just removed the new tab and replaced it using the tab from the old door handle. Perhaps I ordered the incorrect part?? Either way, problem solved and the door handle works like new.
B0057NWCG0|5|great product.  Well made.  I will definitely buy this line again.
B000P0VTG4|1|you get what you pay for and this is junk, flimsy wish i never bought this. I'm glad i went to an auction and picked up an old time spring compressor that is 1000 times better than this. Steer clear of this or you will be sorry
B00121BPI2|5|This is the third car that I have covered with 5 Star. two of my sons cars and one of mine. I have a 2007 dark blue Corvette and two people have asked me (recently), if the car was new. When I tell people about 5 Star, I have to preface my remarks by saying that I don't work for the manufacturer of 5 Star.
B00MXCZ7J2|4|I used this to replace my peeling steering wheel logo on an 06 pilot. Not an exact fit but better then the old one.
B0050UYAJM|5|Installed great on my 2012 Scion XB
B00FRHOI86|4|Good blades, Just came back from a 3000 mile road trip thru some very heavy storms and they worked like a charm
B0000AXMD6|5|Works exactly as described. My hp all-in-one is hard to keep clean. This did the trick. I had scraped along an edge once when laying it on it's face. This obviously didn't remove those scratches, but it did improve the look quite a bit!
B0045WBVUM|5|I bought this seat specifically for the 75th anniversary of Sturgis 2015.  We rode for hours for 10 days.  It was great..  The seat was for the passenger of a Harley soft tail heritage.  The small would have fit but I'm glad I ordered this one.  I never had more comfort riding.  Sure after several hours over 1000 miles in a week a little sore is normal.  A little.  I used to ache after an hour praying the ride would be over.  This will allow me many hours of riding with my husband.  I am a plus size girl 200+ pounds not a little girl so it worked for me.  It is the best money spent.  My Sturgis group thought I was crazy but realized I was happy with my purchase.  They heard my butt is killing me many times in the past but no more.
B003TP4R16|4|Kind of pricey but works!
B00BSXHMA4|1|I bought this to cancel out my F1 light on my 2008 C109R Suzuki. After reading all the reviews I decided that this is exactly what I needed and it worked great. As soon as I plugged it in my light went off. The problem is that after about 30 to 40 days it just stopped working. My F1 light came back on, I put the bike back into the shop and it sent the same code. Which means that the servo buddy has stopped working. Have been trying to contact the seller with no response. I would try another servo buddy but not this brand and not from this store. Do your home work and pay the extra money because this one is junk! Live and learn. I would not recommend THiS product.<br />Rob C
B0059XCVVO|5|Very thick, quality material. It goes on very easy too and is easy to get any bubbles out due to the &#34;ribbing texture&#34; on the back so air bubbles can escape. Seems to be holding up very well too for being a semi high wear area (I have them on my heel guards on my motorcycle). It also looks incredibly realistic. If I didn't tell you it was just a wrap you'd be hard pressed to tell.
B003ZOH63W|4|This antennal add on (works with Antenna Tek antennas too) provides some signal boost, but do not expect miracles.<br />Is very easy to install and works exactly as does the original.
B00CPKV8JU|5|I purchased this for my wife. She was complaining of the stock rear seat. She said it was too narrow, very uncomfortable and no support for her back.I mounted this as soon as I got it, we went for a ride and she loves it! The best part is it mounts and comes off very easy so I don't need to keep it on when I ride alone. This is a great product.
B00588T81Q|3|They work ok. More bumper clips because they don't work on inner fenders. 08 Wrx
B00UV8OPKC|3|Got the product as per the promised time but when installed 3 LED's are not working. As these were installed in my Jeep in dubai can't even return them now.
B007QBPWEU|3|Works well. Only problem was that the fan blades were all bent.
B0000AZ8JB|5|used this in my RV works great
B00S58V56W|5|After an empty box was delivered via UPS, a phone call to Southwest Kia was made and I explained the empty carton, they immediately forwarded another cargo cover to me, low and behold the end of the box was completely gone but the cover was inside, I appreciate the help that the Kia dealer went to, they made sure I had my received the cargo cover. I would recommend Southwest Kia to anyone wishing to purchase a part from them.
B00SI4VM8Y|5|Arrived on time and good quality product.
B000C841GO|3|Item does not fit the 07 Subaru Impreza 2.5i.
B000VSY4HG|3|Most of this works as advertised...the ball lock housing is plastic and the first time I nudged it with my receiver, it broke into several pieces.  But the ball lock still works with out the plastic housing...so, it's now ugly but functional.
B00RGZWIW0|5|This product is sturdy and hold the essentials my son needs for his car. It keeps him organized.
B00667OJA8|5|Works as expected
B00HFWY2PK|5|I love it!  The bluetooth connectivity is simple to achieve and the helmet is comfortable.  The slight visor on the front is very useful on those sunny mornings (or evenings) when I'm sleepy and have forgotten my shades.<br /><br />Now, if you could've done something about the bugs that continually appear on the handy face shield.  HAHA!<br /><br />Sincerely, thank you for a very good quality product for a reasonable cost.
B000BXKZ6K|1|Not happy with this product.  Directions were very unclear and in the end the product was very thin and poor in it's final performance.
B00OU67Z80|5|Great product
B006XK9KZ2|1|Do not fit
B00898LAJ0|4|Seems pretty sturdy see how it holds up against the Limbs
B00AQ4VHR0|5|Simple and easy!  Everything you need for the oil change.
B003B1W71U|5|Bought these for my Taco which still had the factory original shocks and struts and now she rides like a Cadillac.
B00HQULDIK|5|These wall decals are amazing!  I'm 21 and recently started 2 businesses and wanted some motivation and positive reminders of what it takes to become successful.  These really add a nice touch to my office area.  The application was very straightforward, and the decals already come with tape on them in the necessary spots for easier installation.  5 stars.  Would definitely order again.  Thanks!
B004I11UUG|1|The headlight bulb was reversed. The bright and the dim were wrong. Had to use original bulb and wireing. I would not recommend this headlight assembly.
B004K6OTH0|5|Great
B0016KABFC|2|well built EXCEPT the hook is for a little john boat or pwc. it will not fit a decent size eye hook on a boat, made for aluminum john boats and pwd's.  i would change out the hook but not sure if i could sew it back and be effective winching up a 5k pound boat
B007O5GWSS|5|What a great product working very well under heavy loads. I like all the setting it has to adjust to any trailer you hook up to. Great product!! worth the money
B002BJEG3U|5|Quick Connect to evaporated case to heater core 2003 Chevrolet 4.3 v-6 leaking a pint of coolant per day. Did some reading up on some stop leak and this had best reviews !!
B00WWJULPQ|5|Little confused as to why product says MADE IN GERMANY when it shipped straight from China, but a far as a good product, its great!!  Dealership quoted me @$25 per MADE IN GERMANYcenter cap, I got all 4 for $12.99 here.  Thanks again and will definitely visit this site again!
B0001EFSTI|5|Useful to have on your key chain.
B0000AYFTV|5|Nice Heavy Gauge Wire good price. Worked out great.
B0023095N8|5|Definitely worth buying. Now I can see jackasses on their little dirt bikes coming up behind me.
B00CD11G4S|2|Looked fantastic upon installation but the orange color has serious faded in the short time I've owned them. The orange on the mirror is now a very different and pale orange compared to the orange on the arm. Currently looking for replacement because they look so terrible now.
B003O0W8CQ|5|I just installed these struts on my 2007 RX350.  It took about 5 minutes to do both and they work perfectly.  Installation is easier if with a second person to hold the gate.  I can't believe that Lexus charges over $400 for this.
B00ATPWSOC|5|EXCELENT COMPANY, GOOD PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY
B001G7H4XW|5|Perfect fit exactly what i needed and included new pulley, cover and two cover screws.  Came in handy because one of the original screws was so tight I stripped out the head and had to use vise grips to get it out.  Glad I noticed the extra parts in this kit when I ordered.  Some of the others do not show these parts.
B00UZM7G3C|1|Got the wrong size
B00029XB8W|5|thanks
B0131GOKJQ|5|Neat little trash can for the car. The can has a pretty good secure lid. I received this product for my honest review
B000P0TZZG|5|These were a life saver removing stuck exhaust manifold bolts on my 2003 Mustang!
B002T4SEZI|3|Hard to mount on the frame.  Good once it is mounted.
B002Z319BY|3|It does look nice but it is cheap plastic.  The installation method of using a glob of silicone is a joke.  I came up with a different method.  I drilled a hole through it on the engine side and used a cable tie to hold it on.  Now it is secure.
B00AB2PCPA|4|I installed these seat covers in my 2004 Grand Cherokee Special Edition equipped with the deep bucket seats that do not have a removable headrest.  They fit better than expected for a universal set. The straps secure the botton well and I was able to tuck the sides into the plastic covers where the electric seat controls are located. For the price,  I was very impressed.  At roughly $22 for the front pair,  at under $13 for each seat it's a bargain. They could easily sell for $20 a seat as most seat covers of this quality do sell for. The material is nice,  matches my I terror very well. Even if they last 6 months they are worth it. Will buy again.
B00OT59NFK|4|Love it feel a small amount of get up and sounds amazing dont like the hole after the filter but its still amazing well worth it
B003R787BC|4|Great switch
B00IUWM59O|4|My mom surprised me and ordered me a new battery for my bike after a post that my other one had litterally blown up while on the trickle charger (my mom rocks, really, what mom sees a post like that and says, &#34;I think I'll surprise my son with a battery!&#34;?  How cool!)  It came in today, has the terminal screws, showed 12.65 volts when the LED display was lit up and started and cranked the bike right on over (1994 seca II).  It is a battery...It came ready to do what batteries do and it has an 18 month warranty.  You can't go wrong!
B000E5W9P0|5|Happy..
B0051TPJKG|5|A must have in any cooking area.
B000C3YTLG|5|No more fumbling with a strap wrench to get it off.  The internal filtering paper is probably better than a lower cost Fram.  The steel housing feels heavier too.
B00RISXZPE|5|Thankyou
B004GLIMD6|5|Instructions for setup were easy to follow. It worked the first time.
B003RXXOPK|3|This did not work for me..When ordering a key fob you have to check the ID# and FCC #..I am sure this was a good item ,But I did not check..
B00HW79EBA|5|Came in as indicated and was well packed.
B00D7TD7VU|5|Gave it to the lady I currently seeing, just too much going craziness on to not have a way of defending herself.
B01078GH6A|5|bought 5 got 2 free! Two in each car and one for a gift. Works great.
B000R5IASC|5|Very simple to use, worth the money to help solve fuel system problems.
B00TJUI4EQ|1|MADE TO CHEAP !!!!!
B005F9KOY8|5|OEM fitment and excellent quality for my 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer.
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Just as described had to put the nuts in place. Use a dab of superglue.  Need to tow with it now.
B00BD4SK0Y|5|Excellent
B00K069YCO|3|It was difficult to put the item together.  There are no instructions.  Currently, the item has broken during use.  In all fairness to the item.  There was a great deal of stress put on the item during the assembly.  Therefore, I will give it one more try.  This is my resolve verses going to the dealer and ordering the part for $150 to $300.
B004HE1YT6|5|I have 3000 miles on these pads and they are performing flawlessly.  Good product at a good price.
B00FC22KL8|5|Plug and play. ..simple and works! !!!
B001EOV3JS|5|Very quick and easy install.  Works great
B00S0ODBZO|5|Excellent solid tool.  Hope to never have to use the seat belt cutter or the window cracker, but better be safe then sorry.  The tire pressure gauge works perfectly and the back-lid display is easy to read.
B00032K1QI|5|Well made.  Arrived in good condition.  Basically as advertised.
B0016I6I7E|4|There are three things<br /><br />Packaging / delivery<br />Delivery was on time but the packaging was very limited to only the edges and the bag of tools. When I removed the packaging, the draw bar was stuck shut in the hitch. I had to hammer it out, damaging the paint work on the draw bar.<br /><br />Build quality<br />Besides the delivery issue the entire hitch looked very solid, no odd things noticed on the welds. Powder coating was done evenly on the hitch, too bad of the draw bar issue. Hitch size of 1 1/4 inch was accurate enough.<br /><br />Mounting<br />The installation manual fits on one page and is good but I think you can get better instructions on the internet; I used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEPQQl3EKMI  for my car.<br />You need some help to install it, as well as tools like a torque wrench, size 18 socket and  about 5 - 7 inch socket extension. Overall it took us about 30-40 minutes to install the hitch. Difficulty level: easy<br /><br />4 stars due to the packaging issue.
B00JP1GV12|5|Much easier to use. I no longer have to move the previous pump from bottle to bottle. Just fill this with the required amount, connect and pump.
B00JK324Z2|5|The jumper cables are awesome, they come packaged in<br />a very nice case that they can be organized and put back<br />in place after use.  I bought these for my son to keep in his<br />car this winter.  I have no doubt that they will come in handy<br />in our hard NE winters.
B002JBVKMK|5|Fit Perfect on my 94 Ford Ranger
B000NTJ388|5|Fast shipping and fit just fine on my 05 F-350.
B007VRE72M|3|threaded wrong upon delivery. Had to tap it to make the drain plug seat properly
B000BXKZUQ|5|Thanks!
B00EYTIG40|4|Did not fit, but seller was promt to help me out
B004VWLI7M|5|I had already replaced drivers side handle so I knew that you get what you pay for. This is the best quality replacement to factory.
B00BMU98AK|1|DON'T  BUY THIS , IT BROKE ON THE FIRST TRY I DIDN'T READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS PRODUCT. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.
B001Q3AZL4|3|It showed that it would fit YJ frame direct. I had to drill to make that happen. Good other than that.
B00PP66AVC|5|Used these to hold tarp on small row boat during a 4 trip by truck to Alexandria Bay. They did the job very well. The clips make the bungis even more versatile.
B00413I54K|5|These fit perfectly on my 2015 F250 Super Crew.  They match the factory plastic on the running boards and rear bumper pretty close and look factory.  I installed these at the same time I installed the Husky wheel liners.  Two things: 1) You will need to remove the rear wheel to do this job correctly, and 2) If you are doing the liners, do NOT do these first or you will end up having to remove fasteners and re-drill a hole or two. Do them at the same time.
B00D5M5ZTG|5|These fit my 2014 F150 perfectly.  I bought open box items for both the front and back seat and got an amazing deal.  These are not waterproof like the previous ones I had purchased for our 2012 F150 from Cabelas, but I saved well over $100 on these.
B0034ZRXNA|5|Got one for the back of  my Xterrra, liked it so much, I got another for the front of the top rack. Great quality, soooooper cool.
B009T4OFH2|5|Worked perfectly on 2005 SR5 4Runner. Side by side match for OEM wiper arm.
B000TCI826|5|It did exactly what I hoped it would do
B0041ED788|5|Came with free stickers I put on my motor scooter.<br />Pretty snazzy.
B00NWT66CM|5|fits well in my 2004 toyota highlander<br />good price<br />made in japan
B00MC6H0AI|5|I purchased these for the backup lights on my 09 Tahoe and am very pleased with these bulbs! They are significantly brighter than the stock bulbs and this is something that should be stock on all vehicles. These bulbs have a very crisp bright white light output and I would suggest these as an upgrade to anyone - you won't regret it!
B005GSFUWE|5|Worked great as replacement in our 2011 Jayco Swift 26-ft bunkhouse camper.  Easy installation.
B00LNBK5YQ|5|I love this light and have used it in a number of fire/police applications. I live in a area where first responders often have the best equipment to preform their job duties and were money is not the first or last consideration when purchasing equipment. Prior to this I had a blue light made by one of the best manufactures on the market ( actually more expensive when purchased a few years back then the Vivox blue light ) but of the halogen type. It threw a pretty good light but not as good as the Vivox I purchased. In the Pennsylvania community where I reside all the police vehicles also have  the newer led lights but the blue light from Vivox actually casts a it's light further then any of the police car I have been near at fires, roadblocks, etc. It is particularly noticeable  at night time and when the weather is rainy or the sky is overcast. In all fairness I do believe that blue lights have a major advantage being seen for longer distances that reds or white light though. The Vivox I purchased has many different patterns the user can use if you are inclined to use them. I'm just a meat and potato kind of guy and don't need to appear I am entertaining people like going to a disco when I am off to a emergence scene, but if you want the light show(s) that is also available to you. This is a good light and you should buy it if you want to be seen.
B001NI7KE2|5|Adjusted to fit our Tahoe just great. I like that it keeps the clothes from sliding so much.
B00COYNZJ8|5|I love it! I've read a few reviews about the image flaking off. I was a little hesitant but I bought it anyway. I've had it for two months and it hasn't flaked!
B008KPYDD2|5|Fits our RZR 2 seater very good !
B000CO86BY|5|Perfectly adequate and priced right.
B0002SQU9K|5|Good product
B00029WZEI|5|this is very good, but big
B008Y2CMXO|5|Made my bike look new again. Well worth the $$.
B00NQGCDC8|5|Anyone who deflates tires needs this device.  The case is flimsy and instructions are non-existent. But the deflator itself is well built and works great for quickly adjusting tire pressure.  I use this with my 35 inch jeep tires and it really speeds up what used to be a long and tedious process of airing down.
B004A30UHG|5|Purchased this as a replacement  for my failed converter perfect fit. no problems
B0077RR7W8|4|Not for the 1.8L. It is OEM that's why I gave it 4 stars.
B000WJEY8S|5|It does what it is supposed to do, tell you real motor hours. Easy to tell if you need any service. looks strong and resistant. Did a pressure wash on my bike and nothing happened to the hour meter although be careful, try to avoid any water on your hour meter just to be safe.<br />Would definitely buy again. package says its made on US. so that's a plus!
B0041P8ZZW|5|These things are awesome.  VERY easy install and look great.
B00B856PZA|5|Get product. Arrived on time and fit my 2007 saturn aura perfectly. Exact OEM replacement.
B00EKEGRVS|1|Broke in three days 👎
B00EZNDLLI|5|Great full face great product and service
B0049ELS54|5|Original gas cap replacement for 06 Grand caravan....its just a gas cap and works as it should.
B00VDQNELW|5|Worked perfectly, easy to install.
B009MI9JMG|5|Heavy duty and spot on!
B00KC9HIG8|5|Hope we never have to use it
B008YMTCNC|5|very sturdy and works as expected
B001EP0GI6|5|Does exactly what its meant to do
B00L5T2B2K|5|Support our troops.
B00684TIVE|5|Item worked great although batteries were dead when I got it. Very easy to program via YouTube video
B004P9DQLC|5|wonderful product
B008B5U5U6|5|It's ok for vacuum pump
B0002SQYV4|5|I have a black dash. The Maguires did a great job of cleaning and left a nice shine. Very good product.
B00RGZWIW0|5|Sturdy and durable but also easy to fold when not in use.
B00MV6WDYC|5|Great price and just as good as the expensive ones
B004QPCLC0|5|Fits perfect and works well
B0009NUG66|1|Horrible product. We used it for our trip from Mexico. It ripped in the middle in Interstate 10 in Louisiana. All our belongs were thrown into the Interstate causing great danger people behind us. Not only that we had to call the Police to help us stop traffic (which I might add) was heavy. Very disappointed. Not worth the money. No it was not completely full or over stuffed in the very least. It was MAYBE halfway full, and the load in it was light.
B0083H5JCQ|5|Easy to install. Already a week and it is holding fine so far.
B00429NKWK|5|Worked perfectly!
B00OI542BG|5|Small white vinyl die-cut TRD logo, just as advertised.  Just the right size for various interior/exterior accents.
B000C9QPKS|5|An order of magnitude (subjective opinion) brighter than 9011's. Similar to the change going from 9005 to 9011.<br /><br />They come in an ACDelco Box with an ACDelco attached Label with the following information: 077 14350-940 LC 55 GR. 2.727, ACD#HIR1, GM#25770739 D.O.T., Made in China (Mainland). The bulb has the following molded into it: Toshiba HIR1, 12V 65W, P.R.C, PAT. U.S. 4500946, DOT 9011, E132B1U.
B007KFNGM2|5|Awesome!!!
B008BMN8X0|5|Very good , thank you
B00HCJRLRW|5|Cool
B000KOR766|5|Really nice set up, little expensive but it does have inline fuses and you don't have to worry about cutting the ends of your charger and voiding the warranty. I like the way the lugs bolt to your charger and have cover to prevent grounding on the boat, I have a welded aluminum boat so thats a concern even though the boat shouldn't be connected to a negative.
B000CF41OO|5|Perfect match replacement. The Moog legend continues.
B0000AY3SR|5|Worked alot better than I expected
B000Q0S9MU|5|a+
B004ZF3Y40|5|I've used other HIDs in the past, and these blow others out of the water. They never flicker, they are made with quality in mind. Easy to install, easy-ish instructions, and are BRIGHT. Even the packaging is top notch. Best value on the market.
B00133L1DS|1|It's was not correct for the car. Very disappointed.
B003SZZWDO|5|Fit perfectly.
B005NLQAHS|4|It works fine on my new F150. Communicates properly with Torque App on my phone. My only dislike is that it's a bit long, so it sticks out further than I'd like. But, I can't fault anyone but me for that, since it looks exactly like the picture online. I just didn't realize the vehicle's OBD port was so near the front of the dash.
B000R5OIB0|5|Better than expected. Easy installation.
B001DSWB46|5|On time and as expected.  Packaging said 01-03 got concerned I had the wrong part number.  Verified on Russell website and super easy install.
B00CWNVAPW|1|This mirror is of really poor quality. The surface is not uniform which creates a wavy reflection much like you would find circus fun house. I would highly encourage you to find a better product.
B000C5SGCC|5|WORKS FOR MY DAUGHTER 06 HONDA ELEMENT
B00EKEGRVS|1|I bought 6 of these. Broke 4 in the first year. The hinge pins break. Poor quality. The other 2 are like new because they are still on my work bench collecting dust
B00RUEAAHW|5|LOVE IT
B00KE8LS54|4|Good fit and sturdy construction.
B0058J4MV6|3|Fit in my 04 Silvarado no problem. Plugged one in backwards burnt a couple fuses. Had to upgrade blinker relay modgule under dash to a heavy duty LED to get them to work Napa had it for 85 bucks. Looks great very bright. Let's see how long they last. Was disappointed that the back up lights wasn't LED.
B000ND0WB6|5|Great product
B000CMH7JS|5|I have the 2 inch receiver but I am  using the guard for my new 30n foot  Winnebago sightseer RV coach to stop the dummy who is using a cell phone sadly I will be one of a kind I also bought this guard for my Nissan van doing just fine thank you so so much for protection.....
B00W8J67TE|5|Just like expected!
B004R3DUA8|5|Great hitch, fits my Ford Fusion se 2012 perfectly..
B00ZJIQNOU|5|Easy to install. Great light display. I installed them in a 1980 El Camino with High Power H4 bulbs. I had to modify the housing a little, but they fit perfectly! Remember to buy the bulbs needed for your vehicle!
B000CIONQW|5|This is a great little mirror for the outside mirrors on my suv. Easy to mount - just clean glass, peal off covering for sticky pad, and put it in place. I sited it in before I stuck it to the mirror, but it is very easy to adjust once you have it in place. That makes it useful if anyone else drives my car. You simply push in on the mirror frame and turn to position. Great mirror - great price!
B008R4W9WS|1|it broke while using
B008ESKHLM|5|Worked excellent and easy install
B004LX3AXQ|5|Great Charger for the boat batteries.
B00EEG8NHI|1|Of the 4 pieces which makes up this item one was broken into 3 pieces and was totally unusable.
B007RF9IFE|5|Sticker has been on for 2 years now and still looks good!
B000CN4ZQK|5|Edelbrock has to be one of the best quality companies out there.  This linkage kit went on straight forward and worked perfectly on thier 1411 carb.  Hec the carb increased the mileage of my 460 from 11 with the motorcraft to a solid 14 now if I tune it I would think I could get maybe 15.5.  I love Edelbrock parts!
B008I2GY7A|5|I pumped out slightly over 6 oz. and put back 2 full bottles in our 2003 Buick Regal with 140,000 miles.  It seems to be working fine for this last month.  But there were no sounds or signs of supercharger failure.  I hope this Buick continues for 4 more years.
B000BQMYM0|5|Fits just like OEM equipment
B00684TAYY|4|great price works perfectly
B007BKSQ5I|4|The Mirror look is good at distance, but up close starts to lose it strength (you can start to see through it). It fit perfectly into my 100% Brand goggles.
B001FCB4JS|4|Good stuff.  Worked well for sealing a port hole I added to my travel trailer fresh water tank for cleaning purposes.  Time will tell on how well it holds up.
B007P05FBW|1|Shock is to weak for ford F250 tail gate
B00K5A9CW2|5|Not too difficult to install.  Direct fit replacement.  Recommend you first watch YouTube video for removal of old one - it can be a little tricky.
B000C7UM68|5|Works like an IAC should and with a very good price!!<br />I'd buy again!
B00KWLD4RS|3|Hard to put on and not made for a Prius!
B000O5DUP8|5|5 stars for it working as described and needed. one issue is it doesnt exactly stay inside the slot of the hitch cargo carrier i bought from amazon that amazon told me works with it. weird. but no stars subtracted.
B0030CC2XI|5|Easy fit,with factory mirror holes on the door hedge,I had the chrome ones. Got allot of compliments. Very good price for the pair. Well built - strong material.
B004Z9M8W0|5|good product
B007QBTUKW|4|1993 Dodge Dakota V6 3.9L; works great so far. One of the bolts was a little bit to loose from the box, but, tightened 'er up, should be OK now.
B008G2J9ZG|1|fits & works well
B001Y8XK5O|5|100% satisfied fit perfect, look good. .
B010H0QV00|4|[[VIDEOID:c85333518d57dc39dac1caca1b7e1036]] Rather than write much about this 9-in-1 digital pressure gauge I'm going to let a video do the work for me.  That seems to be the best way to show it in action.  I hope it helps.  The one thing I'll say is that I appreciate how well and solidly made it is, and that I like it.<br /><br />I received this pressure gauge in exchange for my testing and this review.  However, I bought a second one as a gift!
B00UULES6G|1|First iff shipping not too bad. Fit and finish? you ask? Fit? Horrible had to cut about 5 inches iff of it, finish you can see in the picture isnt exactly high expectations picking which ones pass inspection coming from the junkyard.. im sorry but thats as hinest as i can be the only perks was the clamos it came with other than that spend the extra money and buy sparco or moshimoto it gets 1 star because i jave to gove at least 1. Iam being honest iam not a negative person or a pot stirrer but this product should fit the vehicle make the hose the right length.. getting ready to smtestdrive now i have to admit i fekt better about using the stock one with a hole in it
B004RI4IG8|2|material is so thin, sunlight can be seen through it. the elastic straps are already stretched out
B00L94A6SC|5|Great
B00B3BH1WK|5|decal bass fish fishing good size  green white great  mounted on oval pine wood stain  and clear coated  friends said great  look  great buy  jerry penna woods
B00IMUC9YA|1|the crystals are right under your fingers. No thanks
B00PU49KC0|5|Cute. These were perfect to hand out after my girls' baptism
B003T7XUE4|3|It looks like a good quality piece but... beware when they say &#34;don't over-tighten.&#34;  What does that mean?  When you see it leaking, you know you've over-tightened as I did because the gasket has cracked.  They need to establish a torque rating or something.  I had to turn mine the correct amount to get the lever alignment right.  Back to the stock plug.  When I get brave I'll get a new gasket and start over, but disappointed for now.
B000M8IEEE|5|Cleaned my weed whacker's carburetor and she started right up.
B00LPSN7YM|5|Arrived as promised. Great fit and finish. I haven't been able to find out much about this K&N look a like, but I wanted to get a little performance from my Toyota Corolla. I ended up removing it after 360 miles of a 1300 mile trip. I thought the engine ran a little sluggish and I was also giving up 2 mpg, compared to  what I got after removing it and replacing it with a Fram.
B00B5KYRG2|3|ok
B0001CMUV4|5|Perfect; does it's intended job.
B004Y9YIU6|5|I put it up my booty whole and it flowed
B004B61B34|4|Nice hitch and good price. Found install videos on YouTube
B00318NQFY|5|Bought it for my  2010 Toyota Prius. So much lower than the cost in the auto parts store (the price or two here is the price of one in my local chain auto parts store).  Easy to install.  Just google how to on the internet (I found an easy to follow video on YouTube) and you are set.
B00SYR42H8|5|product was a perfect fit. Very satisfied
B00546A92E|5|Fits our 4 Runner perfectly.
B00JX28GX4|5|Love it
B000BZG8ZU|1|Item does not fit a 2007 Hyundai Sonata 3.3L like the fitment guide states.  just go for the OE fitment ones listed as they at least fit, albeit a few more dollars than the universal
B0046AFZWS|5|OEM part at a great price
B000WEOQD6|5|Perfectly matches the car's woodgrain interior and looks great!
B000BQYH3Y|3|Did not come with the case shown. No case at all. Just several bags of small fuses. Seem to be okay, but not used any yet. Bought &#34;just in case.&#34;
B00F89GWIW|4|My Hubby needed says It's better than the stock unit. especially if you have changed the bikes bars to after market bars. to clear the windshield on a Yamaha R6 2000 - 2008 .
B00EKBLYUU|5|awesome product, fitted right on, no problems installing.
B0025UGOVW|5|good product
B00608JN6I|5|I bought the OEM barcelona red edge guards for my corolla (NOT THESE ONES. These are for the Camry). I bought the same ones but for the Corolla. They are expensive, but you get what you pay for. They are well made. They are metal and you will definitely need  a rubber mallet to put them on as they are very tight to fasten in place. The look is sleek and matches and blends into the exterior very well. They are individually packaged and each package has a label that tells you which door each of them should be fastened to. I hope these will prevent chipping and do everything that it's expected to do.
B00537FIRU|5|Very happy with hitch. Easy to install, looks good.
B000CCFXYY|5|Used this to glue a saggy weatherstrip on a 13 year old car after a year, its still holding up well.
B000F1112K|4|Quality design and stitching. Just wish it came with more Velcro.
B0084UIHEY|4|Fits Toyota Landcruiser 150 (Prado).
B0069RNQMC|2|Price is good. But fitment is meh. Large gap between the hood and the clip in the middle now.
B005R6R6DG|5|Great product!
B00KWMG4A6|5|great service  thanks A+A+A+
B00092RESK|5|Great for quick wax.
B00FAH8DDY|5|It's a very good tool
B00BJMZ3VO|5|Works great
B000BZ953M|5|good part
B00FRSUWFS|1|Did not fit my 2010 Harley Electraglide
B000EQ1CRA|5|The right filter for my 2006 Ford 6 cyl for much less than at the local parts stores.
B0067ES1MW|5|A bit pricey for just one mirror but great quality mirror never moved after final adjustment even with my rigid frame
B008032QSI|5|Fit perfect and less than half the price of the dealer and local parts store.
B00BN46GEG|4|Sleek and simple.
B001JT1IWU|5|Needed new one to extend my old magnet antenna on my van seems to be working OK with no problem so far
B00UW6V8LM|5|Easy application, looks great.
B00FBRKV0Q|5|It worked fine
B007V6JOYY|5|Love it looks great on my ford escape
B002UD0GIG|3|Works great...but these are really small bottles.  Next time will get the larger bottles.
B0054DWS1W|5|Thanks!
B000VKTUD2|4|Good product, good price, fast delivery, thanks
B004H2N46O|1|Stay away from these.  I installed the first one and it immediately flashed on and then died.  The 2nd one lasted 4 months before starting to work intermittently.
B00BFDG4QU|5|Good one!
B00KI3MN5Y|5|beautyful
B0022ZSPKS|5|no problems great transaction
B00H6XPZN6|5|Super easy to use and install. I love that they give you two extra suction cups if you lose any.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Largest size that I could find and fits my flagship sedan windshield with a little bit of extra.  The materials are the same as those at twice the price; and the durability seems to be close to a decade, after about two months of constant use, there is zero wear on any of the seams or frames.  In the hot OK July summers, it makes a profound difference in the windshield with a car that is dormant all day in uncovered parking (about 20 degrees difference from not having one installed- measured the difference with a backpack zipper thermometer).<br />Along with the product, the seller (manufacturer of the shade as well) has the best customer service & QA/QC that I've seen in over five years.  Thanks for reassuring me that service is not dead within the market today.
B003T5Y08Q|5|Very nice budget option for covering my 2004 avalanche with shell. Fits perfectly and looks good.
B00BCRMB34|1|Flimsy and does not stay on the seats very well.
B001JDE6ZW|2|Loosens easily
B004H1WJ4I|4|Have it on my 2008 Honda Rebel and will meet my needs very well.  I looked for a metal cup holder that would suit me needs but they were either not durable, not very usable or far more money and with Harley logo.  Not having a Harley, I went with this and because it came in 7/8&#34; size, it is a perfect fit for my handle bars.
B000PIMX66|5|Fits my 06 E53 perectly
B00FYYZ5SY|5|Works perfect. Felt like I was a pro installer. 😀
B001TR2F9M|5|Good stuff
B001C9GA4I|4|The converter fit OK on my engine.  My car seems to run better and the check engine light has stayed off since I installed it.  I did not give it five stars because the heat shield from my old converter does not fit on the new one. It is not even close.  In my mind, direct fit means everything is the same as the original.  It should come with its own heat shield if they can't make it like the old one.
B00HY3COJG|2|May be great for cars, but oversize off road tires not so much. Beads take several miles to &#34;settle in&#34; and until then you have to deal with vibration and wobble. Then any little bump sets them out of balance and you have to go through it again. I have tried to find a &#34;tech&#34; department to no avail.
B00VINMRD6|1|Does not fit listed cars.
B00LFL79RU|5|Highly recommend and would purchase again if need be. Prices are awesome.  Thanks guys
B0007IJR1I|5|This stuff is awesome! I tried everything on my car windows from water and vinegar with steel wool to scrubbing bubbles and CLR. None of those worked, but this stuff does! I used a buffer by meguiars that attaches to your drill. It took 2 coats on every window with quite a bit of pressure, but it was definitely worth every penny!
B00DW6SB46|5|Thanks!
B00D10JXY0|5|excellent price and are working perfectly.
B00ESASWRG|3|I guess I didn't read the description right. It doesn't fit my key. 2015 3 series 328i.
B00OLNTJ8Q|4|nice
B000P17NXQ|4|Great trailer brake.  Lots of features. Bought from Amazon as an open box item certified to have all the parts but it was missing the pigtail.  Luckily I purchased an extra one for my other truck.
B000GU293U|5|Easy to install and high quality part and it waterproof, don't need to disconnect trailer plug.
B000BQYH6Q|5|good deal
B002UC30AS|5|all I have to do now is fill it
B0070Y34BQ|3|i dint get what i pay for
B00853A7MK|2|Not truly black, to match my interior. And the screws are not &#34;normal&#34; and you need a special tool to remove old console and replace with this one.
B00027GO92|5|Works great! Put on 1990 350 Mercruiser Bayliner Capri 2050cx gen one outdrive.
B0039H7Q4O|4|One of the first things I installed on my new Jeep Wrangler and they look great. Nice and easy low-key personalization effect, and keeps your door recesses from keeping scratched by rings or keys. Be sure to pivot them around a bit before peeling off the adhesive as they do have an orientation that they fit best in. My only concern is they stick out a bit from the vehicle so dirt and rain water may build up beneath them over time, but that was expected upon purchase.
B004AA1PUK|3|Mine have disintegrated and plugged the breather hole on my VP Racing gas cans.  I fill them with 93 octane fuel that is listed as having up to 10% ethanol.  My guess is the ethanol breaks down the rubber used in the sealer of the cap.  Otherwise, these are very effective at preventing leaks when you open them up for fueling.  I am hoping they revisit the materials used in these caps to address the issue with the inside sealing portion coming apart and contaminating the container.
B009NMRDJC|5|Perfect just want I wanted. Thanks
B007G8UIRO|4|Arrived quicker than scheduled.  I would give the instructions a 4 out of 5, installation took 30-45 minutes.  The materials were strong and sturdy and they fit my car well.  Very well priced too.
B00KLKVHGK|5|Removed old carburetor installed the new one with inline filter . Everything worked out great riding again . Would highly recommend and its less than half price from buying from a dealer. Thanks
B003S7454O|5|Great
B00MAUWZME|5|Bought for my Grandson-  he loved them
B000NJAAA8|5|Cleaned my RV rubber roof very well.  I had no idea how dirty it really was until I used this product - turned it back to bright white again!
B002PYBZJO|3|Did not find a code for the trouble i had.
B008H5UAY6|4|feels great although a little wobbley. my wife loves the pocket in the back.
B00RV83UUG|5|Very bright! I love leds and I have had no problem waterproof I have it on the front of my jeep and tress sticks rocks mud have made contact with it and have not had it break. solid light bright price is great couldn't be happier
B000NDD9GG|4|These are used on Newmar motorhomes for many years and I have a 2003 Kountry Star that need two replaced. These are the same shape and fit fine however they do not include the lens gasket or the gasket that goes behind the main body like my original ones did. I used some silicone but wish I could have found the correct part. The original gaskets where not usable after 12 years. Oh well. Now ya know!
B00XILM5GK|2|End caps fall off  Great looking overall
B000VU7NL8|5|Fits perfectly in my 2015 Silverado. Shipped on a Monday received that Wednesday.
B0006IX85A|4|Part seemed a bit cheap. But it works so far.
B000BRJTZE|2|Doesn't fit properly.  Had to jerry rig it.  Very frustrating.
B008RS70UK|4|Love it ! Very beautiful and well designed.
B00L77Y3NA|5|Fit perfect looked good 2015 xp1k4
B00J8WWTKK|5|Good product
B00KX7G3QU|5|Excellent
B007NZ8DWW|5|Fit perfect!
B00363M0TC|2|Picture is not what was sent to me.. but it did what was advertised.
B00B5ZYY38|4|Plate cover looks much better with these.
B00NX1VJU8|5|I have used this product for the past 20 years. It's wonderful to work with.
B00XXLZ5T4|5|Very big and handy for any car washing inside and out!
B00RL9Z2O2|5|I did the install myself and only spent about 45 minutes, from opening the box, to both rails installed and they fit great! Install easy, and the rails look really really good!
B001G54LRQ|5|A lot heavier cover then I expected. Fits my bike like a glove.
B00RU9R4QC|1|I got what i pay for<br />This doesn't fit my 2011 toyota venza<br />False advertisement
B000C2WCGG|1|did not fit had to cut to size.
B004PBXTVM|4|This is a great addition to my bike. I love the way it looks without the factory indicators.  I do wish the light was brighter for daylight use, but maybe that is the smoke look.  I really wanted the smoke look and it is great.  Very easy to put together and install.
B00HFLE3B4|5|This is the best stuff on the planet.  I have sprayed this on carbs that were almost black and it cleaned them right down to the original Alodine finish.  I am a licensed FAA mechanic and worked overhauling helicopters for a major manufacturer for 35 years and all the chemicals we used for cleaning metal parts are all included in this product. (MEK, Acetone and Freon) I worked on automobile engines for friends and as a hobby and found Cyclo Carb Cleaner not only did a great job on Carbs, but you could use it to degrease anything.  Awesome stuff. A note of caution, use in a well ventilated area.  Delivered quickly and packaged properly by the seller.
B0076QWTB4|1|Received wrong hitch and have had trouble returning it.
B005MJYUAA|5|Fast delivery and accurate description.....
B000CITK8S|5|Does a great job.
B00335R0AC|5|Exact fit and great price
B00RV2WB34|5|Awesome
B002N2L048|5|Saved me crazy money compared to buying from the dealer.  This was easy to connect once I figured out how to remove the door panel.  The mirror controls work perfectly.
B0008D6NK0|5|Works great, great pricing, easy to install.
B00TZGEFPQ|5|Perfect for my needs!
B00GI781GE|3|Not really worth the time it took to put it in
B00UHD4HJA|5|Cool stickers. ..arrived  very quickly.  I would  buy again.
B0043EB01C|5|Outstanding, better than clay, especially given that dropping it doesn't render it useless.  Works great on glass too.
B00BSFZQCI|3|a little bit dim
B005I7JAX8|2|Will not read codes, only erase, Sits there forever saying it is reading but never get results
B0002SRCZQ|5|This tool worked very well for me installing steel band clamps around inner tie rods.  If you were installing steel band clamps frequently, I imagine there may be more efficient tools available, but this suited my needs, as a shade tree mechanic doing inner tie rods ends once every few years, extremely well.
B00FWO68GY|2|Bought these headlights about 6 or 7 months ago at most and I am very disappointed right now. I already have a headlight out and it is not the fuse, I checked. I paid a lot of money for these and I see yall have raised the price even more sense I have purchased them. I want to warn other potential buyers of this problem. Also I'd like to ask what kind of bulb it is so I can fix it, it is the main halogen bulb on the outside.
B008KPSD60|5|My car is minion themed (decals and mats etc) just adds to the fun part of the car.
B00V30EE2Q|5|fantastic...really happy with Amazon.
B00WNQGPNA|5|GREAT STUFF AND GREAR CUSTOMER SERVICE A+++
B005GGE4UK|4|I am very happy with this purchase. The color matches and they fit like a glove

B00G7W0UM8|3|Didn't fit even thought it clearly said it would and then charged me to send them back
B001IYDQV2|5|A+
B00UNTU3VO|5|Love it so far....thank you
B00EU1OMH2|1|Repl is defective. Broken housing and no voltage output per auto advance.  I want a full refund.  Will ship both useless alternators.
B002M4GF38|4|inexpensive, match original factory look, simple to installs and very quick deliver
B003AOSGO0|3|Great concept,  not so great product.  I almost regret the purchase,  but it's the only solution out there.  I hope R&D reads this, there are 2 major short falls..  1)configuration,  no matter how you install these you can barely roll the wind up or down.  I even installed them backwards and gained a tiny bit of space.<br />2) the included replacement screws are too short.  At first I thought it was plugs they put in to plug the old holes.  I removed those and the handle still popped off..  I had to go to Lowe's and get sheet metal screws 1/4 &#34; longer..  So RR save money by not including useless hardware or pay the extra $. 04 and include a  screw that works.  Being that this is basically the only solution out there I'd buy it Again...  3 stars for not checking your product in the real world.
B00TK2WRFK|4|I wanted this decal for my cooler and it works great.
B00P2D3W00|1|Does not fit 2004 Toyota Tundra Double Cab as stated. Works fine other than it doesn't fit my truck.
B00DC6W20U|5|It's pretty clear by my username I'm a car enthusiast. But not a normal one lol, rather the fanatical one that knows entirely too much about oil. I put this oil into my Shelby and absolutely love it. Will be going into my Rio, and Veloster next.
B00BTLEIIY|2|Very difficult to put on and smell very strong
B00NJ0TUCM|3|windom film does not come with instructions.  finally got it put on and after a week it all bubbled up on the car window and started peeling off. not recommended for cars. works great on the inside door window on the house.
B00LSTUI2M|3|One of the bushings has pieces of the rubber like coating missing.  I ran my finger on it and a piece of the polyurethane flaked off and splintered into my finger which I then had to remove with tweezers!  Not cool especially for something that cost so much! Where is the quality control around that place?
B000UVUAFO|3|Slightly dulled the scratches, but they are still very visible.
B003Q2N1EG|5|Has been a great helmet for my son. The adjustable quick connect strap is nice too.
B003TSMQWU|5|A must tool to have. ....
B00JYXN34Y|4|working so far in the day they've been in.  This warms up the bulb twice as fast as the previous 55w ballast from another &#34;brand&#34; that died.  This one also runs the bulb at the proper color.
B001DH0QNU|1|Purchased this radiator in June 2014, lower core is already leaking.  AC Delco brand is now similar in price, spend the extra $$$ and save time and money in the long run!
B001KRYIC8|5|Fit perfectly into my 2005 Durango Dorman 42914 Windshield Wiper Arm. From now on I will replace the wiper blade with the more economical &#34;cut to fit&#34; like I do on my other vehicles.
B00T8UY53Q|5|Great light
B000C7L4EW|1|I've normally been a big fan of Putco products but they missed the target on this one. There is no leeway to adjust fitment on the handle covers due to the space. Once you put them on the only way possible the handle cover is not aligned to the cup portion, with about a quarter inch offset on both passenger and driver side. It's small, but annoying and really takes away from the entire look. A huge thumbs down. If I could pull them off and return them I would, but due to the quality of the 3M double stick tape I believe they would break. Don't bother with these.
B000TYQAXI|2|I have purchased 3 of these. The first one was great but i tried rolling my window down in the winter and it was frozen so it stuck and the cable jumped off the pulley and kinked over the slide rail. That was my fault so i figured I would buy another one and replace it. Unfortunately the second one was not the same. The first model had a one piece cast metal window clamp/slider bracket with a nylon insert to run on the slide rail. The second two have a thin metal window clamp that slides into a little plastic slider bracket that has two tiny hooks to clip over the slider rail. The front clip had one hook break off after about a month which caused the rear bracket to tilt when in use. This caused one of its hooks to break off also. This allows the window to tilt while traveling up and down which makes it walk up out of the clamps about every 3-4 weeks (about 15 cycles). Before I received the third unit I had dissembled the first and put the cast sliders on the second one and reinstalled it to get by. After the third one showed up looking the same as the second with the tiny plastic hooks I decided to keep it for the cable kit so if the second one breaks I can use the cast hooks on the third one. If you buy one I would hold on to your old brackets. On a side note switching the window clamp brackets is not fun and you may want a friend to help.<br />On the positive side it showed up in a timely manner and was in excellent condition. The holes are all in exact locations and the gasket is already installed around the edges. You have to move all your grommets and wire tie blocks over as well as your speaker and motor but everything fits perfectly.
B00HZB9CMY|5|The amount of time spent laughing after applying this to my friends car and it remaining there for a solid week before he noticed and peeled if off, made it well worth the $!!! Hahaha
B000WEKMVG|5|works as expected
B0002JN588|5|Way bigger than I expected! This will last forever at the rate I use it!
B0029XLMU8|5|Wonderfull
B005N76NPQ|1|Sizes run VERY SMALL!!
B00KQ2HQ6I|5|Exactly as described! Awesome seller.
B00DJ2D45O|4|This worked to program transponder keys for my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR.  After spending a couple hours with this Toyota Smart Key Programmer (TSKP), I learned a few things.<br /><br />Key #1 should be a working programmed key<br />Key #2 and Key #3 should be unprogrammed, properly cut 4D-67 transponder keys<br />****You can only have three (3) keys programmed at any one time****<br /><br />1) Put Key #1 in ignition and turn to on position<br />2) Plug TSKP into OBD II port on vehicle (located under dash on driver's left hand side on my 2006 Toyota Matrix).<br />3) You will here one beep when you plug TSKP into OBD II port, about 5-10 seconds later you will here a series of beeps (three for my Matrix) and finally (about 30 seconds later) you will here one long (about 3 second) continuous beep.<br />4) After long beep, the Security Light should turn solid red (on without blinking) (which indicates the vehicle has entered Key Programming Mode.)<br />5) Remove Key #1<br />6) Insert Key #2 without turning for 5 seconds<br />7) Remove Key #2<br />8) Insert Key #3 without turning for 5 seconds<br />9) Security light should change from solid to flashing (which indicates vehicle has exited Key Programming Mode.)<br /><br />Now you have 3 working keys!<br /><br />If you have no working keys, you can press and hold the LED light on the TSKP while plugging it in to your OBD II port, then release the button/LED and let the TSKP go through its series of beeps until you hear a single long beep, then you can program 3 new keys without any working original by following the same instructions as above.
B001ADH0YK|5|Works and fits great, would recommend fro everyone.
B00HUC8R06|1|Not what we expected. They way you clip the front bumper duo feels like anyone can just come and steal it. I didn't feel it was safe to leave my car parked outside with that on it.<br /><br />The quality is very good though. I just didn't like the way it clicked on the car. It didn't  feel safe.
B00XK370VG|1|This fuel pump did not fit my vehicle
B000BYB87Y|5|AAA+
B0009OR8V6|5|Best tool ever! I've been doing brakes everyday and this tool is so helpful and very easy to use. I would recommend it to every mechanic out there.
B0009IQZH0|5|Very good for dusting electronics. No dust left behind, and only a few fibers shed on first use. These are oversized and very soft, great at picking up dust.
B005FKCBTS|5|couldn't pass them up for the price, especially since they were on sale and cheaper than the OEM parts...car stops great and have had no issues 6 months into having them
B001PNSXNM|5|Love them
B00IYJ4OR4|5|Excelent
B004PEDFJ0|5|Purchased this vest as a gift. Very pleased with the material and workmanship. Vest runs small compared to the size chart, order next size up.
B00YI3IGA6|5|This product is amazing and solved my problems of other sun shades not covering the full window. My back seat is now completly shaded for my girls. And I love that my five year old can still roll her window down. Definately an A+ product and more cost effective than tinting all my windows
B005H12QBS|5|Easy installation. They seal great don't have to worry with water running in comes with good gasket. Easy to adjust. Easy to slide out when pulling trailer. Very happy with purchase!
B00ZY1MNRS|5|Fits my 2015 VW Golf perfect!
B00BGZ1VPQ|3|Cover is fine, but it would look nicer if it had the Corvette emblem as it covers up the emblem on the key fob.
B00BEKMTGI|5|Tractor starts right up.  Been working for months.  Orientation is a little different but had enough slack in the wiring for it to work.
B003VB0YWY|5|Great product.  Keeps camper stable and secure.  Very pleased.  Very easy to install.
B00G8I4D2Y|4|I'm using this for a non-automotive application--to line a cabinet which will hold my 3D printer and keep the noise down. Great for that, easy to apply. Easier to cut before you remove the paper, but can be cut carefully after that. Hardly any rubbery smell.<br /><br />One thing about the roll, if it sits vertically, then the sticky goo will gradually flow out the end. Probably this takes days, but mine must have been stored that way, because the goo had leaked out and the roll had glued itself to the inside of the box. There was a small sheet of paper at each end which did a pathetic job of catching the goo. But, even though this was annoying, the produce was still useable. I have some other similar material which was shipped in flat sheets and that was easier to work with.
B00ZOCGT72|2|Not accurate at measuring air flow, causes flat spots in acceleration, worst than 13 year old original MAF sensor.
B0022ZXO40|5|Well, what's not to like about a cargo net? It's reasonably compact, and just sits quietly out of the way in your stuff until you need it. It looks well made and durable. I do like the smaller 2 inch openings because this stretches a whole bunch, and these openings get a lot bigger when tightened over a big load. You can keep it stored in a ziploc baggie if you don't want the hooks snagging on everything.
B00P9XAZM6|5|Quality kit that manufacturer stood behind to replace a missing part even though they said it had never happened before. This kit was put on a race car that has not been back on the track since the installation.<br />The belt alignment was good and the installation took about two hours to complete the R&R.
B0091DJWV0|5|This device saved me hundreds of dollars in potential repairs, and paid for itself the first use. My steering wheel got wet in the rain and the SRS light came on. This device found the DTC for a short circuit in the driver's side airbag circuit. I was able to clear this code and turn off the SRS light within a few minutes of plugging it in. The point is the, the short circuit corrected itself after the steering wheel dried out, but the light remained on. Toyota wants you to come to them and pay them to diagnose it, replace some parts, etc. With this tool, you can do what the dealership can.
B0024ECDL4|5|It doesn't leak, I thought they all leaked, finally I'm done finding one for my travel trailer that doesn't leak
B00PXF6F9M|5|Snug fit
B0077A7VD0|3|Overall a nice product. After a year I damaged 1 panel and Undercover doesn't send panel replacements. Only whole new kits. Disappointing. After a year a lot of the black finish on the panel frames has flaked off. Great looking product but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who plans on opening and closing it on a daily basis
B0094A6UUQ|2|These failed to stick. I cleaned the area, let it dry, stuck it on, pressed all over, and it slid right off. My order was from some place in Europe, though the shipment arrived from China. I'm sure they all come from China, but putting that out there just as an FYI. Tried bending it slightly, as another reviewer mentioned, but it did not help. Maybe if you really work at it, you can succeed. Back felt sufficiently tacky, so I'm surprised it failed. I have a 2010, which has black door/dash inlays with small metal edge accents, whereas the 2011 or 2012 onward models I believe have full metal door/dash inlays. It might look better with those than with my model anyway, and the price was so minimal it was worth a try. I think my 2010 actually looks totally fine without these. Though maybe that's just my brain rationalizing.
B00M9IAJQQ|5|Yes
B000VKPS1U|5|perfect
B000HBM85C|5|Works great
B009YRI64C|5|Good quality! Fast Ship!
B00BJNNNQU|4|I guess I didn't really read the description of this product well enough, because I thought that the sanding discs could be attached to a power drill. Instead, you get a small cylindrical sponge and sand down your headlights by hand. Eventually the adhesive Velcro patch on the sponge starts to tear away from the sponge with all the vigorous sanding, but I was able to complete the process fine anyway. The whole process takes about an hour or so, and it might be a good idea to have a small stool available (or an overturned bucket) because leaning over for such a long time is kind of a pain. My headlights did not look exactly &#34;like new&#34; but they were certainly an improvement. Overall, for about $20, it is worth it.
B000E3DU9G|1|I purchased these shocks and found that they did not fit my 1989 F-250 2 W.D., although &#34;Make Sure it Fits&#34; cross check said it did. The front top mount on my truck requires a straight stem application not the through bolt eyelid mount shown and received. In order to fix this problem I will have to buy a stem to eyelid shock mount conversion kit (more money) and it wont work shock is too big. I crossed checked the Skyjacker web site and they also have this H7023 model as a fit for my front shocks, they need to correct this error, the shock mount conversion will cost me $24+ if it would fit. update I contacted Skyjacker and they will exchange for the correct shock, I would have to pay shipping both ways $24+. Skyjacker was very accommodating and friendly.
B00NJ9MZH0|5|Got it fast. Worked great.
B00LGNM7G0|3|Well for 15 bucks sweet ...but a few of the leds are not as bright as the rest still functions as it should poor quality control
B002P8UQWW|4|Good for the price
B005SGZCMW|4|I bought it as a gift. My son likes it very much. One strap did come off. Don't  if it was his fault or a flaw in the cover.
B00AAWAPIA|5|Awesome product exact discription  new in box great price fixed my issue
B000MDY88U|5|It arrived in a timely manner and fit perfectly.  The main thing is to make sure that you measure your tire diameter properly as shown in the additional pictures of the tire cover.  The diameter includes both the rim and the tire sidewall all the way to the tread.  If you do that, your cover will fit fine.
B003YCKT3Y|5|Like those towels they got the job done
B00E6VM7HS|4|Everything went great!! Until I got the part an if was the wrong part.my fault all mine.hopefully the return proscess goes as smooth same the delivery.. We will see!!
B001HQACCW|2|Since it's advertised to primarily facilitate placement of remote coils - why don't they package it with the coil boot on it instead of a spark plug end??  Makes for a lot of unnecessary work.
B0031OXGXU|5|Perfect replacement, easy to install.
B005DX6BKW|5|Quality item, OEM caliber execution.  The lights are bright and depending upon your installation have the potential to look as if they are stock. I had the lights professionally installed and couldn't be happier with the result.. Congrats to Phillips for delivering an aftermarket product that is worth having.
B004R35HEA|5|great fit on our 94' seabreeze,m.h. looks like brand new now.Seems a little expensive though.
B00OP1VSRE|5|Got it before I expected and instructions were easy to follow.
B003IHKXKY|3|Looks heavy enough but haven't used it yet.
B0022ZGYUQ|5|replaced broken bungee  things on gun rack
B003UHNMMS|5|Was a lot larger than I thought it would have been (should have read the description more carefully, but works exactly as advertised
B005G8D37S|5|good quality and fast shipping very good
B004P1WNBE|3|Did not fit my vehicle as it said it would.
B0088SKCY0|5|Excellent
B007KPWU8I|5|THE BEST ! QUAILTY AND PRICE !!!
B007JEK37K|5|good materials, fit, and functions fine.
B002XM5G70|5|good pump very quite
B002692308|4|It was easy to put on. Got it within couple of days .
B00JA3BMDW|4|The Nubee works well and is worth the price.  It would have received 5 stars if the battery that was included with it was not dead.  After a week or so of jostling with the seller, they finally mailed me a good battery.  I'm satisfied overall.
B008MC8AXC|5|Fit like a glove on my 1997 rexal motorhome.
B005QA8WNQ|5|This thing works pretty well and I've gotten good use out of it.
B00D8V5NB4|5|Only just received.  Hope it works as advertised on my new car's leather upholstery...
B000TYL7KY|5|worked good
B0028PJ10K|5|These are the best thing since sliced bread! Leveling my travel trailer could not be any easier unless I has self-leveling auto jacks. I have 20 of these and they come in very handy for any leveling, stabilizing, or tongue jack stand needs. I also recommend the accompanying caps from Tri-Lynz as well. Excellent product at an affordable price.
B007HGF398|5|Does exactly what it is advertised to do without impeding airflow.
B003TODXQ2|4|Works good but no return port as the description said so I have to catch the excess fluid in another container then return it to the tank.
B009XZW0CY|5|Well made and seem to provide a positive seal against the elements.  Nice enough that somebody will probably swipe them.
B00FE1XRNC|5|prefect helmet
B007GMHTQ8|5|This is a great basket for the price. Easy to install, mount and very sturdy. It's also quiet at high speeds.<br /><br />One nit-pickey complaint: Amazon couples this product with the KEEPER, a vinyl roof top cargo carrier. However the dimensions of the vinyl cargo carrier are 44&#34;. While the Highlander dimensions are listed at 44&#34;, the interior of the basket is only 41&#34;. This means that the cargo bag does not fit inside properly, it hangs out of the back.<br /><br />Now, it's a soft case so you can improvise. Honestly, after taking it on a long two-day one thousand mile trip with over 100 pounds of cargo, everything was perfect and secure. The Keeper was awesome and the Highland rack was even better.
B000C3BB30|5|Excellent product direct replacement for a wear item.
B000CO9Q9K|5|Best price around! Quality shock for the price. Installed easily on my 91 Corvette.
B00RA13HK2|5|Nice OEM construction and quality.  I used this badge to help offset the 'Yaris'  and 'SE' model badge on the passenger side of new 2015 Toyota Yaris (see pic).  I wish that it was about 10-15% larger than what it is, but it still looks awesome on my mighty little manual 5-spd Yaris SE. :)
B009WEV5AO|5|Easy to fit - look great and suit the M50 perfectly
B000N5W2YE|1|This is total and unprecedented junk!!  If you're getting for the Honda 750 Aero aspect to have to cut and bend to get it to fit, meanwhile fracturing the chrome.  Junk!  That's all I can say about it!
B000FOL0AA|5|worked like they said it would.
B00OO1VO60|5|great
B0083P3YPW|5|good product
B000UOC5UE|5|These make my life so easy. I no longer need to tie and untie knots when I vend at outdoor markets and festivals. I use these along with a pair of soft loops to anchor a cinderblock to each tent leg. It takes 30-45 seconds per leg to setup and take down, and I never need to worry about the knots loosening in a strong wind (or tightening so much I can't pull them apart). The pale silver color is really pretty and blends in perfectly with my silver and white color scheme, which is an added bonus (I didn't want to go with bright orange for aesthetic reasons). And they're long enough that I can use the extra length of nylon as a makeshift hanging line in a pinch.
B00BL3I77S|5|good
B0009PSJ22|5|Shipping was amazing and I can tell a big difference within an hour of it being plugged in
B000C9WL6A|5|Started to purchase these for my 2009 Yamaha grizzly 550, instead of the now made in China Yamaha oil filters (Yamaha oil filters were made in Japan up until last year)
B002ET2O4U|5|I USED THIS TO CONVERT MY FRONT REAR ON MY 92 S15 JIMMY TO MANUEL AND DO AWAY WITH THE PROBLEMS OF THE FACTORY VACUME SYSTEM. I HAD TO CUSTOM MAKE ALL THE BRACKETS BUT THE CABLE WORKED OUT GREAT.
B00I9FE266|4|very communicative and responsible, I recommend
B000W3RU9Y|5|These bungeys where just what we needed for our camping trip. They seem to be strong and should last with good care.
B00MUF1APW|5|These are really bright. You can buy in confidence that these LED&#34;s  will show a tremendous improvement in your view backing up.<br />Update one week later: Still very bright and no problems with them working. I would recommend to others to buy.<br />Bought for my 2013 F150 FX4 Super Crew
B002X1NLOQ|5|Easy to install!!!
B004131JHK|5|What failed was just a small plastic end, which is not unexpected after 15 years use, but requires all this new assembly. Lots of different sized nuts and screws, be careful to keep them in order when removing. Use plastic wedges to hold window up as you remove attachment screws. Otherwise a simple take off and replace job that may take an hour..
B001KOBGP8|5|Good inexpensive and quick
B00RIIQVFU|4|They are brighter than the 12 v incandescent light they replace.  If you turn them on in bright sun you probably won't know they are on.  The plastic seems sturdier than the OEM lights (I don't know the brand)  The integrated lens/LED light is easy to snap on and off but should do OK when scraped against branches lightly.  The base raises the light about 3/8&#34; which I view as a downside.,  I'd rather see a really flush mount.  The the base is mostly flat with a channel for the hot wire.  It was tricky for me to get the pigtail for the light and the two hot wires (in and out from the light grommet in the camper).  If the base were more hollow, it would be easy to mount, or if there were fittings to insert the an outgoing &#34;hot&#34; it would be a big better.  All in all I like it and I will buy another for a spare.  It's a lot better than the incandescent fixtures the camper came with.
B000C34KWO|5|Worked like a charm for me. Had a squeak that would not go away. Until I replaced the belt with this one.
B003CJD18O|1|This does not only not fit the bike, it is jb welded together. I cannot get even an email to help me fix the problem.
B000TFL0MI|5|Got here on time. Works great<br />Jim
B004WLM3PS|5|Way better than the sweet-t toggs.  Real pockets so you don't have to dig ur valuables out of ur jeans or saddle bags.  Also ordered the heatsheild patch as my 1st pair (sweet-t) got a little singed on my pipe.  Hoping to be proactive with this pair.  Ordered a size smaller than the sweets and they fit well.  Also got the Tekk Toad jacket and love it!
B004M0D0JM|5|I am not disappointed with this purchase at all! Very pleased with the dice, color, and the size of the dice! I thought it was going to be small but it came out to be big. Must buy!
B0081HPGBW|5|Locks with no issues. Would recommend a helmet lock extension so your not trying to get the D ring in a tight space.
B00FT69VXC|5|I love this set. It fits to a T in my old Camry. And very confortable.
B00JPXT4ZA|4|Shipped && delivered very fast. There was a lot more wrap than I anticipated, which was great! I used it for the emblems on my car but couldn't get it to work for the rims. Only down fall the adhesive was not as strong as I needed..
B000BGHYJS|5|it is what it is.
B000BPWSKE|3|the pulley actually came with this so didn't need it
B00BJCN7Z8|4|These work good until they start to get wet from wax use and have been rubbed on the material starts to fold which makes it hard to wax, although work great most the time.
B00I2ILW54|5|nice torque you can get on it, compact and can be used for multiple applications, easier then jumping on a crowbar
B000CBSFK4|5|A+
B0085I1DL4|4|For the money it worked well..
B001FJDAZC|5|As with everything I've ordered made by Dorman, it was top notch!
B003ZJ2IQM|5|Easy to install.
B00SIBI8IO|5|Good product
B000VLF990|5|Works great
B000PAM77O|1|arrived incomplete without washer
B00PCEG7A6|3|I'll start off saying these look nice. The in channel model are better the the tape on for looks. The problem is they don't work with the Ford seals and the window will not close with automatic windows. You can get them to work 95% of the time if you leave the window closed for about a week after installing.
B00DUUYNW8|5|I have rated this item negative with an honest mistake I want to apologies to the seller. This item is great it was the wire harness I Had  trouble with and they are not the seller. This item was exactly what i needed and I'll recommend it to any one again I want to apologize to this seller.
B009WEE66Y|1|Never saw such a setup ever.  When you turn the stearing the slide arm sticks you in the leg. Worst piece of bike part<br />I ever put on. And I was told if it was opened, I couldn't get my money back. What kind of a practice is that?? Do you know<br />if a new pair of shoes fits unless you put them on??  How ridiculous is that? You can't order a part and just look at it and say,<br />&#34;Oh yah, that will fit&#34;. You have to try it on. I expect my money back from this kit that did not work. If not I am calling Consumer<br />Reports and tell them about this ridiculous policy that you can't try the part on to know if it will fit OR work at all. It's my money<br />and time spent for this or any other parts I may purchase. If this is the way you operate, I won't be purchasing anything else<br />from this supplier.
B00OH0S5Y2|5|Great value. I had no issues with any of the bulbs working. All bulbs worked and work well. Color is good. No complaints here
B00JH2GMMC|5|This item installed by the dealer would have cost me $ 230.00. Buying through amazon and installing it myself saved me nearly $200.00. Great product, great price,quick delivery.5 stars all the way.
B008ESIGII|1|We bought two headlights through this company.  Both had faulty electrical connectors.
B00L0O4OZM|5|Much cozier than original seat for sure
B001DKLKRS|4|Good price for decent tool.  Go to hardware store and get a jam nut to keep forks from rotating, as tightening the fork against the end of the thread is not sufficient to prevent rotation.
B00HSM6G06|5|I love this cup holder, wouldn't ride without it.  Perfect size for my large cups.  It is a must.
B00HQZC4YC|4|I ordered 2 of these exhaust tips but one of them came without the clamp. Product looks great though... Solid, nice matted black paint.
B00LEBLI82|4|bought these to replace the porch and compartment incandescent  light bulb on my RV. Light out put is white and brightness is adequate.
B0096BH8NQ|5|Cheaper than weathertech!  Does the same job fairly thin though.
B00HDMEUCW|1|The backing comes off and leaves white flakes all over the carpet.
B007PVIARW|5|Great buy!
B00ROSXT0E|5|Fit perfect together, comes with 18awg wires. Didn't have a single problem hooking these up
B00P3EQ5QQ|5|Perfect fit, easy to install and moves air as expected. Good performance for the price.
B000EQR7XS|5|The mechanic told us we needed a new gas cap because ours was getting worn out (the tread, I guess).  This one was significantly cheaper than buying from the dealer.  It looks and works just like the original and it saved us money.  We couldn't be more satisfied.
B006B262AS|5|Replaced rear pads on a 2009 Kawasaki Ninja zx6r. Perfect replacement no issues.
B00805YGUM|5|Outstanding product! Gorgeous, fits perfectly and fast shipping. Will be purchasing more for our other vehicles. Thank you!!
B000IPAK9S|5|Heavier then the cord that came with the MH, I use it between my house cord and the surge protector keeping the surge protector locked in in the storage compartment, while in use.
B00CO8UIF8|1|Says it works with the Garmin Nuvi 2597. I ordered this and an OEM car charger same time, this one does seems to make the unit think it is a PC connector and does not set it to charge, where the OEM version just starts charging it immediately. I returned mine.
B00IAUNGJE|5|Well... Kinda find it funny it now says it does not fix my kia soul..that had to of change after I purchased it...If thats the case, The seller should of been reliable and contact me of the sudden changes.  My review : I really did not have to read the directions ((The directions are located on the back of the photo in fine print with photos)) Product smells like any other seat covers you would purchase at the store. I did have to adjusted it to make it snug, I put it on less then 30mins being that YES it was big I had to add my own DIY to it (No problem) am I satisfied??...YES 100%. The fabric feels good, The elastic strong and so far so good!! Now going to add my touches up to it.
B00MP4OJTC|5|Looks awesome on the front of my fusion and a great show of love and support for my brothers and sisters in LE
B000MNN4WQ|3|Good quality weeping strap, but ratchet is finicky and not as smooth operating as my cheaper brand strap I own. Also, the hook end connector is smaller than most other brands, especially the distance between ratchet and hook is quite short!
B0013FGPTQ|5|Hardest part was getting the old one out. Once that was done, this took three seconds to pop in. Works great.
B000C46Z9O|5|Installed and seems to be working. Exact fit replacement. No requirement to send the old one back.
B0038N8706|1|I had to return them. They were too wide for my liking.  2&#34; 1/2 wide. And they didn't have the crease like the pictures shown on this page.
B005C9CAUW|5|2015 BMW X3&#60; good fitment.
B00O8FKU80|5|not a gm product but still looks good and easy install
B00TPA2R0W|5|Product was received as described and very quickly.  Thank you!
B007KTINWQ|5|I've been using Turtle Wax ICE Spray Wax (and Detailer) exclusively for years. They are easy to apply and offer a superior shine to my (now) retired BMW 330i (Jet Black) to my current Infiniti Q50S (Hagane Blue). With a microfiber cloth the entire car (including the wheels, door jambs, engine bay) can be done in about 45 minutes. I do this, each time, immediately after a bi-weekly car wash.
B003YI421I|2|doesnt  bond  metal  that good, and  its  a over glorified super glue  with  some sand  bonding
B004I0YUOU|5|Great product. It fit just like a glove.
B00H6XPZN6|1|Not a good product. It does not stick to the window, it keeps falling down.
B0000AY4MK|5|No one has parked too close yet.
B002GTKAHQ|4|Okay, so here's the thing. These mirrors are UNIVERSAL. I was cautious upon ordering these because of people not being able to mount them properly and complaining that there were no instructions. It's true, there are no instructions but let's remember that they're UNIVERSAL haha. But if you have any sort of mechanical sense or Macgyvering skills, you'll be fine. These mirrors have a ridiculously wide range of vision and hardly vibrate at all (and i have them mounted on a single cylinder thumper so that's saying something) I'm expecting these mirrors to break, not because of the build quality (which is surprisingly good for the price) but because I often have my bike in precarious, mud covered, deep woods type of situations but once again, for the price I won't be heartbroken. I only have one mounted on the clutch side which is all you need with the field of view.. but when I destroy that one, I have the extra one still in the box..... gnarly!
B000C59M8Y|5|Worked great.  My old shock were beyond bad.  I could hand compress the old ones and they would not even expand back out.  So putting these news on, I saw a very noticeable different in ride quality and the height of the rear of my truck.  I put them on my 94 ranger.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Works as expected, great product!
B001JT757M|5|good product
B000A8MVMM|5|The wheel worked fine.  We wanted the chrome color, but settled for black. It worked out we painted the other wheels black the look good on our truck.
B009HIMVLW|5|Wow, this is such a great item. The can is sturdy, easy to carry, with large handles and a secure, locking cap.<br />While the nozzle is well designed for filling tanks, while meeting CARB regulations, it is not readily apparent that the second adapter must be used to refuel standard consumer vehicles. I would heed buyers: practice using the adapter with appx 10L of gas (half-full can) to get used to the function of the nozzle.  (The base of the nozzle is metal, to seal to the opening, but the adapters are plastic. This is mated with 4 small screws. Too much weight on the plastic may break it at the screws.)
B0006IX7WY|5|Great to keep things from shifting while traveling!!
B00W8DBZQU|5|I bought these for my Wife's new Jeep Renegade that did not come with any mats from the factory. These mats arrived on time and fit perfectly in the front and back seats. Jeep logos, patterns and openings to lock down to factory mat clips. I paid 60.00 less for these mats than what the dealer offered them for and they are OEM.
B002M4B3Z8|5|Fairly easy and quick to instal- did not come with installation instructions, so I had to go online to get the information, but I'm very pleased with the product overall.
B00G6IMXSC|1|Doing a complete restoration of a motorcycle for my wife.  We purchased a brand new seat cover (Black vinyl).  We wanted the seat to be brown to work w the paint she had chosen.  Obviously, I wanted this color to last.<br /><br />After reading many reviews from delighted customers.  Ordered the Colorbond prep cleaner, Adhesion Promoter, and LVP spray dye.  Followed instructions for all three products.  Watched the tutorials on the Colorbond website.  Waited til we had nice weather and plenty of uninterrupted free time.<br /><br />The finish went on smoothly and turned out beautiful.  Gave it plenty of cure time.  A week or so.  At first it seemed to be pretty tough stuff...I was really impressed.<br /><br />Over a couple weeks, rode the motorcycle 3-4 short trips around the neighborhood.  Pleased as punch w Colorbond finish.<br /><br />Rode bike yesterday.  Wearing Levis blue jeans.  And the Colorbond is starting to RUB OFF the seat.  Exposing the original black finish of the vinyl.<br /><br />VERY DISAPPOINTED.  COLORBOND LASTED 5 RIDES OVER A COUPLE WEEKS.
B00QU6YOEQ|5|Looks and works great.  I replaced my old lights with two of these and plan to use them to replace the other fixtures as well.  Price is right and I recommend them for your RV.
B000X22E4U|5|This worked like magic for my 2009 Camry. The package didn't come with instructions on how to install but with Youtube and Google who needs instructions nowadays. This was a great buy!
B007JEJQP0|5|Fits nicely, but save yourself some trouble and cut the splash shield in place. The measurements are very forgiving, and longest part of the job was removing the shield and fiddling it back into place.
B004GEELME|5|Wonder price on this. I paid right around $300 for this switch at auto zone on February of 2014.  By March of 2015 my headlights would go out sporatically so I knew it was time for another switch. Due to the fact, the $300 switch barely lasted a year, I opped for something cheaper. I  very satisfied with this product. Been working well for a few months now at least.
B00UYQU1J0|5|Love  it
B000C9HBA6|5|Nice, quality disk.
B00J3QM4SS|1|Well according to their website &#34;A: A small number of alarm units from the first production had programming issues, which can cause the siren to trigger the tilt or shock sensor while the bike is at rest. These units will have a PASS code sticker with the number 1310/3&#34;......I got one of these and am not going to install a KNOWN defective unit on my baby....NO! Shame on you Amazon/Gorilla for not pulling the defective batch from inventory!
B0041TLKSM|1|worked great for 2 weeks.  installed in 15 minutes.  now it is making a noise and I am looking for another. unacceptable....
B000BUQOEU|5|I bought these to augment my Sunsetter awning to provide more stability in the wind.  Sunsetter wants 3 times what these cost and are stronger.
B000HBI9EQ|5|great buy.
B0007M1UO6|5|as described and fast ship
B008Y7LST8|5|perfect, fast, no issues.
B00IPMA9JC|5|Great fit
B00651CLVE|5|Really great product!
B00FSIN0U6|5|this LED really lights up the side of M.H. and won't melt the plastic lens cover.
B00BUO6ACM|1|Does not include mounting clips.  Only brake pads I've ever purchased where these are not included in the package.  Would have been nice to know this when putting the order together.
B0054SLWKA|5|Very nice product. Looks great fits well. The only  chrome part that we added to my truck that was actually metal.
B00HLAF9H6|2|I recently bought the driver and passenger side axles from GKN because I was developing a really bad click while turning in my jetta.  It was cheaper to buy both and install them myself than it would be to have just the one problematic side replaced.  This axle appears to be new and not a regrind, but I'm honestly not 100% it was a new axle.  Importantly, though, my ride is now much quieter and I saved a boatload of money purchasing through amazon.  UPDATE 10 JUNE 2016:  I have recently noticed some wobble under acceleration only which is a telltale sign of a CV issue.  I looked in my wheel well and saw a nice spattering of grease all over it and the inside of my wheel.  the CV boots they used have cracked and the joint is no longer sealed.  i'm changing my review to 2 stars, and will contact the distributor to see about warranty.
B00GMISJYS|4|A perfect addition to the mirror mounts on my Jeep TJ. My wife's car came with side facing signal lights, and I find that it's a good addition for lane changing on the highway. A little bit of extra warning can't hurt. I grafted the wires into the front turn signals........But, be prepared, there's only about 3 feet of wire attached to these lights.
B00HZLMDXO|4|they work just fine
B001QUBRM8|3|They tighten very good but they remain aproximately 5 mms out, i mean, they are very long
B00K1JVSMY|5|The rubber mats were little slippery when brand new but they were ok after a few hours of driving. This is some quality piece of thick OEM rubber mat with affordable price. They fit perfectly on 15-16 WRX/STI Subaru models. The rubber mats have spikes under it to prevent from moving around the floor. The driving side mat also has 2 holes which hook onto the floor hanger.
B000C5BYOY|5|Works great on my 1991 F150 5.0L 2WD with an e4od transmission.  Be aware you do have to re-pin the connector.  The general rule of thumb is you re-pin the wires from the old connector in the exact same position on the new connecter, which may not be the position shown on the instruction sheet (as was my case).  Lots of info on online forums to help you out.
B000LY9GZK|2|2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. Note this item is not a direct fit, even though Amazon said it was. I had to take off the Lowe part of the front bumper/plastic piece remove part of air dam, and cut holes into the lower bumper cover piece so brackets would fit through so I could put that lower bumper piece back on.  I could've just returned it I guess, but after doing all this, it fits and looks good.  Without doing this the brackets would not have fit.
B004J9E47I|4|direct fit
B00CQD4BUE|4|The original dipstick was a fiberglass rod, and heat and usage caused it to be brittle and break. This dipstick is the one that should have been the original. Very flexible (Mini Cooper oil tube has many kinks) and spring like so I believe it will last as long as the car. Great product!
B004FNNYMY|5|This replacement lens was priced fairly and the installation was very easy.  Looks great and I am very satisfied with the purchase.
B00X9VIN8I|5|Seem to be of good quality kids love it
B00J262R9A|5|This tuner has done wonders for my 2014 mustang 3.7 v6. With a custom tune I was able to get rid the brake over accelerator feature and let loose a few extra ponies with a 93 octane race tune.
B0081H7FD4|5|Thank you
B000EQ9P1A|5|Great filter, fits well
B0068FV460|5|I received 2 clamps and 4 hex key bolts (as pictured).  Each clamp faces a different direction and can be used facing up or down and flipped either way depending on the application.<br />I love the clean look of the recessed bolt holes.  These are high quality and lightweight bar mounts!
B001NG8I8G|5|will not except a return at all. I have unopened can
B00T6JEEXU|2|Too small of a viewing area
B001FCE5AI|4|Works reasonably well.  It didn't leave any significant spotting, so that's good.
B008PWN6SS|5|Great hat!!
B00NF17JX2|5|Great replacement on a 2003 Saturn Vue.  Easy to install and works great.
B00TYTXJOM|5|Perfect fit for a 2015 Murano Platinum.  It is held on by 5 brass bolts with washers.  Having a second set of hands during installation might be helpful, but not required.  In lieu of a second person, just prop it up with something (I used a small cooler).  A 9-12 inch extender for a socket wrench would be helpful as well, but technically not required (I managed, although I banged up my hand/wrist pretty good).  I also didn't need a jack.  Total time to install was maybe 15-20 minutes, mostly because one set of threads on the Murano was a bit stubborn.
B007EXMYIC|3|Best Place to buy parts for your transportation.
B005DMGLBW|5|This keychain it's pretty  nice. I had one from the dealership but broke off. I search on the web for a cheap one, and this surpassed my expectations. Cute little thing. Nice!!!!
B00SI9GUTK|1|They promised color match.  Couldn't have been further from the truth.<br /><br />They did eventually offer a full refund so no harm no foul, but definitely wasted my time and some extra leg work to fix my mistakes.<br /><br />MAKE SURE YOU TEST THE COLOR FIRST!
B0009IBJE4|5|Great charger.  I had an old Schumacher battery charger from the 1970's that was still working pretty well, but they certainly have made a big advancement.  You have 3 amperage settings depending on the size of your battery.  I use the lowest for my ATV batteries and highest for my car battery.  This is a smart charger, which means that it charges at a faster rate when the battery is very low, then slows the charge rate as it approaches full charge.  This reduces the overall charge time.  They do this by controlling the voltage, which is displayed in the LED.  There is one button you push to toggle between % charge and voltage, which are displayed on the LED.  Supposedly, it has a desulfation mode also, which is useful for recovering sulfated batteries.  My only complaint here is that they could indicate when it is in the desulfation mode.  But, what a great charger.
B00A1YPUJQ|5|A+
B005642QES|5|5.4 Triton PCV pipe for my Expedition, perfect fit. My original DID NOT have cracks, but apparently had stretched to almost twice the size of the new one, where it attaches to the back side of the intake manifold. Did not fix my vacuum leak, but was a large source of the leak.
B004OFNJZ0|3|More attractive than functional!  Fabric is so sheer that intense sun beats right thru it.
B00EZWQONG|5|Total game changer.  Fab!
B00IRIOJC2|5|These front bearings worked great on my 2006 Yamaha XT225 Dualsport bike.
B00STVAOA8|4|Cute little key chain.  Wish it came with a key ring but I can add one.  Going to use some clear polish to seal it from getting dirty.
B001ILOE8Y|5|Worked great!  Same exact one Advanced Auto is selling for way more!
B00L9IYWKG|3|It was pretty good. Just realize there are a few different shades of black
B000CLQPY2|3|It indicates it,s stainless steel but it corroded in 1 1/2 years. No comparison to the original.
B00BLZ8BLI|2|This product works, it does what it claims. Maybe if I drove a yugo, I would not mind this thing hanging from my vent. Gave it to my daughter, she loves it.
B007XWDIBQ|3|Well first off the picture of the product is false I got a totally different third brake light than what is advertised you can see the one I got in my picture. It fit alright I wish the weather stripping was thicker and the back part was a little bit better made it felt cheap. It plugged in great worked well and looked cool. That's why I give it three stars! Advertis the product with the correct picture!
B00OZ6SEF8|3|Less than 6 months and its leaking...cheap chinese made, even feels cheap. So sad that once great American companies are sending themselves to doom with chinese labor...dont buy, my advice.
B00HJ6O4A0|4|Big enough for family of four and can get wet and dirty while easy to clean. Wish it was just a little softer but overall happy with this purchase.
B000CAZ1OS|5|awesome, worked like a charm.
B002VEX208|4|Bought for back up
B002R109DS|5|Perfect Fit
B000NW8E94|5|This piece replaces the original part by the manufacturer. Simple and straight forward fix. Easy to do for the DIYer. The problem that necessitated this replacement was a hard starting problem after putting in gas at the pump.
B0012GTVVA|5|works great
B0079OG0FY|5|I wear these when running.  They stay in place and I get lots of compliments on them.
B00PPU4OB6|5|Great product though it was kind of difficult to apply, it is overall a great product and has not faded one bit.
B003V57NUQ|1|We recently got a 15 1/2 ft canoe.  The first time I hauled it, I rigged up a device with the luggage rack on my SUV, a pool noodle, ratchet straps and bungee cords.  I drove for 2 hrs going at least 60 MPH and it never budged.  But, I still thought I needed a canoe carrier so I purchased this one.  It arrived quickly.  Today, I put it up on my vehicle.  It was not difficult to install (I didn't even have to ask my husband for help), but 4 of the 12 washers were missing.  After raiding my husband's washer stash, I finished the installation, loaded the canoe, using ratchet straps to attach the front and back and headed for the lake.  On the highway, I couldn't go more than 45 MPH, without the canoe shaking all over the place.  After about 10 miles it started shaking no matter what speed I drove.  I stopped and tightened it and drove the rest of the way about 20 MPH.  We did eventually make it to the lake.  On the way home, I switched out the straps for ratchet straps.  The dang thing still shook to the point I thought it was going to fall off the whole way home.  I'm going back to my rigged up carrier and if shipping isn't too much, I'll return this.  Don't try to use for a canoe.   Update:  when I removed the carrier, I noticed it had damaged my roof.  now I'm really unhappy with it.
B005NLQAHS|5|works great for jeep liberty.
B000LDIJ72|5|No issues yet after 3 months
B002VK78LQ|3|Cheap metal rusted in a few days
B00M082HGK|5|I had no problems it worked out Great for me i, m a happy man
B003ASQO8Q|3|Never deployed it but have them in the car.
B00AYAIC60|5|I bought a pair from Walmart because they were on sale and to say the least these are the best wiper blades I have bought in my life. I used to go with the Bosch models and they were OK but I immediately noticed an improvement as soon as I put these babies on and I was even more satisfied when I had to call the service hotline because one bracket accessory was missing and without a wince they sent me a full set of brackets. I don't know about these negative reviews but to me these are a great set of affordable wiper blades. Thanks Michelin!
B00CPN0BB8|2|The adhesive on the film isn't the greatest at all and what I was trying to due to make my interior look nice didn't work. The film started to come loose after a few days so I will buy something better later on with a 3M adhesive backing. I had to remove about 95 percent of the film because the adhesive failed on the film and I cleaned everything twice to make sure it sticks but it didn't.
B00AESZ4EK|5|Was everything and more then I expected!!
B0006SU3QW|5|I used this to black out the bow-tie emblems on my truck.  It was the first time I have used Plasti Dip, but I've heard good things about it, and gave it a whirl.  I didn't want to permanently paint over my Chevy emblem, so instead of using regular paint, I used this.  If you decide you don't like it, you can easily remove it with your fingers by peeling it off.  It dries into a rubbery/latex, and if you overspray, you easily remove it by with a finger or a soft cloth.  It has endured carwashes and regular highway driving, and holds up beyond my expectations.  I do plan future projects with Plasti Dip.
B002E5815K|5|Worked just fine. Way cheaper price than  Advanced Auto!
B00NAK81ZS|4|GNB tensioner and tensioner pulley do not have machined tips/ tensioner rod surface. Seals are loose in box.
B000C9WLA6|5|unfortunately, our customs rejected these oil filter, i was angry but can do nothing.
B008IYH3KU|5|Nice switch.
B006H34BUY|5|Nice quality. Would recommend.
B004ZJZ4DU|3|After reading the reviews of these things being too small, I opted for the larger size. It's rather odd fitting and they just don't have the strap setup perfected to really stay in place and be comfortable too.
B006VXFCK8|5|loved it.
B0000AZ8JB|4|works great
B00JQYNF76|4|The Holding Tank material seems to work very well. Bought gloves to place in the toilet for use.
B00KYQQM5M|5|Good white light output with a tint of blue. Great seller! Recommend seller and item!
B0024GQ32C|4|Good fit. For 95 Suzuki Sidekick JLX
B00BZSE5CK|5|This Jeep hitch cover looks amazing on my 2015 Sahara Unlimited Attitude Edition. It fits perfect and has a simple clean look. You will not go wrong with this cover.
B0024NSWTC|1|Not happy... Reached out to seller they want me to take pics because the passenger side light has moisture in it. Was installed properly....now they want me to take pics of the light and the warranty sticker... Now in order for that to happen have to take it to body shop because the bumper has to be taken off to get to the light......so inconvienant....not happy
B0000AXDB3|1|Did not for for me.
B00LTHWV64|5|Has a shiny side and a matte side. I use the matte side; it's great.
