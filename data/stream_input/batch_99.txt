B0065HQEPW|5|works as advertized
B000QWA2GY|5|Great product! Very good quality for the price. I was impressed with the latex quality and how it has held up. It is nice to be able to move and bend over without being too constricted. It has the right amount of firmness.
B00BO11ADK|5|panties are made well and super cute the girls loved them but they run small.. if I buy again I will buy a bigger size than I need to .the 7-8 looked more like a 5-6.
B005O33LJA|3|I have always used a large undershirt, every brand I buy are large, even the 10.00 a piece ones. This shirt was sewn in Vietnam and they seem to run smaller than a normal size large. This makes me not want to use this Kirkland brand anymore.
B000TFKN12|5|I bought this jacket for my boyfriend and he has gotten a lot of complaintments on it.I would like one for myself.I have checked out many brands and this jacket beats them all.Most of the once's i saw had the open sleeve and this has a snug cuff fit at the wrist not allowing cold air up your sleeve (brrrrr) It also has a very nice blanket liner,nothing cheap except the price  Great Deal!!!
B00422MCVW|5|Nice color, very good looking leather, am probably gonna buy the same one but in black color as a birthday gift to myself
B0079TRA9E|4|This is a great parka, my husband loves it. It very thick, heavy but very warm.Only con would be it does run large! Size down!
B009I04BU8|1|Suspenders were so bad that the clasp fell apart on its initial fit.  Cheap doesn't begin to describe how bad they are.  These were not &#34; giant clasp &#34; either  .
B012D79CJ2|5|Goes great under my 50's retro outfits!
B003IBI0PK|5|We got lots of comments on Halloween about how cute this was. It fit a little big. It washed well. We are saving it as a hand me down for the next baby now.
B00MU3J6T6|4|I love these pants super sexy!
B0041RDAGY|1|this costume may fit a new born to 8 month old...but no way would it fit an 18-24 month year old. When u open it, it looks like something you would put on a stuffed animal, lol. Tiny, and the hole for the head to go through is tiny as well. Not sure why they label it for this size. I bought the next size up, for 3 year old and that one fits my 22 month old, but i still had to cut it a bit in the back to comfortably be able to put his head through the shirt.
B008C87QXG|5|I got this for fathers day and I love it. I keep having money come out of my pocket and this keeps it need and easy to deal with while looking good.
B00MA6T116|3|X_large size is smaller than usual.
B0071N3HRM|5|VERY cute & very well made! Great materials seem like they will hold up well over time. Got size 4/5 for my almost 5-year-old and it fits kind of big but you can roll the sleeves up and it's perfect...plenty of room to grow. My son LOVES his new coat! And like other reviewers have said, wants to wear it even when it's not raining. Great purchase :)
B00CMTZ33G|5|Love this shirt. If you don't want it skin tight, get it a size larger than you normally wear. It's good quality for the cheap price.
B00X5KW5QE|5|Very sexy lace mask.  I like it when my wife wears it with her gold body chain and nothing else.  The construction is durable and it is made from high quality materials.
B00B1NL95A|1|I couldn't tie it.
B00JAAIP7Q|1|i expected something offering the quality of Marks and Spencers V Neck T shirts. The material in this T Shirt is very flimsy and it is baggy. For the price it is a rip-off.
B00LENAM1O|2|The suit is very cute.  I'm not happy with the support.  To me, it is not a &#34;Push Up&#34; tankini.
B0098GDWES|3|i liked the color and the fit mostly, but my arms are unusually long for my size. I like the shirt anyways.
B00OHZDITO|5|AWESOME!!!
B00MOSYHS2|5|My Grandson Loves This
B00G57LAQU|4|For a women with an ample bust-line but an even more ample hip & buttock area, fit and flare dresses are the best design creation and this dress fills that ticket perfectly.  It's very flattering and suitable for me to wear to work or to a casual event.  It would have been 5 stars if the dress was lined.
B00APM1RX2|5|The fit is perfect, and the fabric is soft and relaxed. The product is great. I recommend it to everyone.
B00B1ZNQ8Q|3|Lovely, but way too thin material.  I do not want everything to show and its too hot to add under garment.  Returned but sad.
B002R0F8OE|2|Unfortunately, this item shrank after two washes and the turtleneck part was choking my daughter. She is 4 years old but very petite (38\\" tall, 30 lbs, 5% weight percentile), so she was on the small end of the size range. I was really disappointed b/c I had spent about $20 and wanted it to last longer than two uses. When it arrived, it fit perfectly, so I don't see how this would fit a 6 year-old as listed in its size range.<br /><br />Now that I read the washing instructions, I had washed it on warm, not cold as instructed, but my warm setting on my washer runs cooler than warmer. Also, I have washed items of similar material better on warm, and they did not shrink.
B004INGWY8|1|I wish I could say better things, but unfortunately this bra was terrible. It didn't fit at all, was saggy, old lady like and the fabric was very rough! For a 38D it only was two clasps wide in the back (most have three, especially in a nursing bra!). I'm very disappointed. Bella Materna came highly recommended, but I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone.
B00EZHZHGQ|5|bought this for my 16 year old daughter. It arrived very quickly  fits perfectly and looks well made  she has worn it at least a dozen times in the last three months
B006FYKS2U|5|I wish they made this in more colors so I could buy them all!  This shirt is long in the body, so it stays tucked in, even after 8 hours of bending, stretching & turning.  The fabric is soft and luxurious, but it stands up to a work day - including a very hot and sweaty one (no sweat stains).  VERY stretchy material means no binding or too-tight spots.  Went through the washer and dryer like a champ - held its shape, size and color beautifully!
B003XXZU0Q|5|I got the lime green color.  They are just as pictured.  I am a size 18 and the sizing was perfect, no stretching to get them to fit...the comfortably fit without being baggy.  They did tear easily like most tights though, so not an issue for me.
B00ARH7YCS|5|I bought these shorts for the price however they quickly became my favorite cargo shorts simply put I'm highly pleased !!
B00HWRT3DY|5|I really like these.  The cloth is comfortable and the pocket holds the goods in place.  They outline in bluejeans well too.
B007ABVGZK|5|The mad scientist costume is truly maddening!  I am using it for the Monster Mash song in a variety show.  Instead of the hyper needle, I am using a bubble gun that jolts the monsters wtih bubbles instead of electrodes.  Should be very funny!!!!
B0038JA2EY|4|These are nice shirts for the cost but order a size smaller than usual.
B00P927Z1Q|4|It's sexy. Obviously not super expensive, but good quality for the price. Will be fun to wear this summer.
B007AM2Z8G|5|I had got these for my son and they are perfect! They were cheap enough to buy multiple so we would always know where one is PERFECT!
B0087AZTKG|4|Got a medium. I'm 5'10&#34; and ~170# - Get a size smaller than usual. Sturdy and warm, but haven't been able to test in the rain yet
B00B1ZMUZG|2|This was much more see-through than I expected. Plus, it was tight under the arms, but huge around the waist!  Had to return it.
B00C40ZL8U|4|I am 5'4&#34;. 110 lbs and the XS fits perfect.  The material is thin so I think this dress is somewhat overpriced, however it's the design that I find worth spending $100 on.  It looks very unique and sexy... Like it is WORTH more than $100.  Looks good with a belt.
B00KYUA79A|5|My son loves his bag. It's just the right size for 2 n half year boy. I have embroidered his name on it. Quality is gr8 and colors are as seen in pic vibrant and delightful.
B00DJM4VQU|3|Like it
B00KDG1AT6|2|to big..  I liked the feel so I was going to try the smaller size but by the end of the day it was rolling up my thigh and became very uncomfortable.
B00O3N7GNY|1|I wear size 14 so I got size 1x PJs. The material is super comfy, I love the print. The decorative string where a drawstring should be is frustrating, but I could deal with it if that were my only complaint. The biggest issue is thgast the sleeves are more like 3/4 sleeves, not long sleeves. I am not so tall (5'7&#34;) that my arm length is such that this should be an issue. It makes the top essentially unwearable for me as I spend a lot of time pulling on the sleeves & I purchased it mostly because I needed more long sleeve comfy tops. I am very disappointed with this set.
B00IT8NRS2|1|not so great
B00IZC7JXG|1|Too small although I took a size bigger than I usually wear. Normally wear a L and i took XL should have taken 1XL. The print n style is pretty though.
B00H7IQ44E|5|This is a beautiful belt and my granddaughter loved it.  I was happy with it.  It had lots of sparkle.
B00MA67384|2|I've worn them a handful of times and one of the pairs already has holes in them. Disappointed in the quality of these socks. They are very thin and not durable.
B0042LTD1K|5|Long Pants<br />This product was just like other items I have purchased from othe stores. I had looked everywhere to get additional long pants to add to my stock. These pants are cotton and I received the size I needed.<br /><br />I count myself as lucky to have found them.
B00829CH20|4|Love these bras! They fit so nicely and are very comfortable. I'm a 32E and it is difficult to find nice fitting, pretty bras. Keep it up Fantasia! The only downside is the price. It's very expensive for women with larger breasts to find good bras at a reasonable price.
B00E0FG0ZA|5|Got this for my four year old, it fits great. She loves it and so do I. That's all I could ask for.
B001RMO3NK|4|There s none to say about it , the quality is good , using.it.since two.months ,fits well in my pocket no issues at all , paid.for.what I wanted.and they delivered.a.good.product
B00269EI9W|5|Tula hats are first rate. This hat has a very wide brim. It is light and flexible. Tula makes other style hats as well. I recommend them all.
B00GG1SZTA|2|What ever size you are; buy one size smaller.  Other than that the color, quality and logo are sophisticated.
B008OH1NR0|1|This is a genie bra.  Why doesn't it say so in the description?  The genie bra is too constricting to be a sleep bra, so I found the description misleading.
B004RL3APU|5|Of all Thor shirts I have seen, this is probably the coolest! It arrived just as described and I'm always getting compliments when I wear it!
B00I5G54GG|5|Great coat! I ordered it for daughter and I am very pleased.  The coat is thick and has a fleece interior which is perfect for winter months.
B006PVNZPA|5|really cool. Nice package, comes with a really awesome microfiber. They fit my husband's Oakley Hijinx like a glove, his sunglasses look brand new again. He was able to switch the lenses himself.
B00IC0KJTC|5|Fit my 9.5 size feet, stays in place, and is hidden in my shoes.  I'm very happy with them.
B00EY2Q55Y|5|My daughter wanted these to wear with her peacock costume for Halloween.  They are silky and very nice.  We love them!
B002ITRKBI|5|These are perfect and the gfills are very absorbent. The velcro wears down if you put them in the dryer too often, so I just air dry every other time I wash them. Overall, awesome for the \\"green\\" moms out there.
B00ARBSMR0|1|It's thin. It's tight. I was very dissappointed. I will never wear it but is it worth the hassle to return for a couple bucks
B00NAXBMSI|1|All clothes ordered from this company are absolutely dreadful,buyer beware.arms very long.strange fit.different shapes and stitching  come loose,only worth the bin.
B00VEPHJ7M|3|Smelled like vinegar when I first got it however it's fine for just a simple tank top to wear to a match.
B003WGNF9W|5|these are great everyday bras.  I think they are super, nice fit and coverage.  I was concerned it might be to lightweight or I might spill out but it is a good all around bra.
B007ZDVOQ4|4|This is a nice skirt. Perfect to wear to work in the summertime months, as it is lined yet still lightweight. It fit way larger than I anticipated though (I ordered it to be a bit larger than I needed, as I knew I could take it in a little if needed, not knowing that I would need to take in in a lot).
B00LI2A48W|5|Nice pattern, comfy knee-high sock. I wear it with boots and they are great!
B00GHHOKHY|5|took forever to get here but that is probably because she's based in Asia somewhere.  But the scarf is lovely my roomate really seemed to like it.
B00L281MDI|4|Seems to run a little large. I ordered a size 2x which turned out to be a size too large. Nevertheless I kept it because it's been so cold here in Michigan. Yes it's real warm and fits as expected. I could do without the floppy belt across the back.
B00G1ZV5CK|5|So I was a bit concerned that I wouldn't be able to pull this off because I am only 5'4&#34;, but it actually looks great!! I got the medium and it was perfect. It is comfortable and I thought it was quite easy to put on.
B00TGDCR58|5|I,ve bought other clothing from this line and have been very satisfied.  I really like these briefs.  I got the mediums, which is the size I always buy,  but they actually ran a little big which was a nice surprise.  Also like the ample pouch and the double material in front.  The only small negative I have is that the material could be a little better seems to be a bit thin.  So will have to see how they are after a few washing's.  If they hold up I will be ordering more.
B007CFIG02|5|Love the fit.  A little wild in the pattern, but I'm very pleased.  I'd like to have some in a bit plainer color or pattern.
B00A4DODSI|5|A souvenir of a concert that didn't get close enough for me to see.
B006IEB9ZC|5|Great hat, does its purpose and fits well.Its pretty thick so super warm Arrived a day early.  Very satisfied!
B00J0RDOJS|5|These are great
B0070QC00U|5|thank you
B0018OLI0I|5|These jeans were good quality - fit as expected - and were delivered quickly. Price was good too.<br /><br />I would order them again.
B000N8S0NS|1|If what you are looking for are jeans to be worn at your knees with your underwear showing then by all means buy these because that is what they must be made for.  I have worn jeans for over fifty years and have always been able to buy jeans in my size without any problems.  These jeans are too big in the waist and way too tight in the hips especially for relaxed fit jeans!  I will never buy another pair of Dickies brand jeans!
B00FHM0H0O|5|Hubby loved it
B006PI12FS|3|good
B00MIQVVR0|5|Love these! They are ultra soft inside and out!
B002XZMEV8|5|This is so comfortable - it fits great, it's flattering and the material is strong but breathable. I put a LOT of wear and tear on leotards because I'm an aerial acrobat, and this one stands the test - it has survived beatings from silks, trapeze, lyra and corde lisse. I am 5'5,&#34; 150 lbs (lots of muscle, though because of the whole aerial acrobat thing), 34D and a long torso, so I bought a large.
B00PPPBPZY|5|Love these! They are made of high quality materials,hold together well. Keeps them warm,they don't frey or tear apart after wearing several times, like some other brands do after only a couple times wearing. Best of all they love them! Definitely worth the price. Which isn't all that bad.
B00C1WZ9PG|4|Arrived fast, looks great although it is a little smaller than expected. But with T-shirts I do understand they all aren't cut the same. All in all great buy for my wife. We love ,&#34; The Walking Dead &#34;
B006PV5XZK|2|I have a normal sized head and ears, yet I could not get the headphones to cover both ears completely and not slide off. Hence I returned them
B00HWFCUOU|5|Light enough to stay cool but give good coverage. Wash well. Got one in black as well. Highly recommend.
B00CHZMOAK|5|The leggings were a bit short, but the overall outfit is a cute keeper!!! Would buy from here again, just order 1 size up:)
B0076FI5LI|4|Very nice shirt. I am very impressed with it and I have gotten pretty nice comments on the shirt. Very comfortable also.
B00JWE4PXI|2|these shirts don't run anywhere according to sizes we are used to buying.  However I gave them to grandchildrens friends and I guess they like them
B0035ZQ7ZO|5|I bought this dress too big because I didn't know how the material would fit. Now I wish I had got my correct size which is a 8 to10 & I bought a 12 to 14. I had a seamstress to alter it & fit great. I wore it to my Birthday bash & everyone was amazed. I loved it. Well worth the money spent. Now I can pass it on to my niece.
B00S3UIVNW|4|Very big.
B00G5KRRE6|3|The shirt arrived in a prioroitymail tyvek envelope which was fine. I was surprized at how light weight the shirt was which was also fine. However, when I tried it on, it was a bit snug across the chest and arms. Since the shirt does not come in an extra large XL (appearently there are no such people in india where its manufactured) I need to be careful about building up my chest and arms if I intend to wear it...or gain back the weight I lost.<br /> I do however like the colors.<br />When I called back to Minniapolis MN where the shirt was shipped from, I encountered a very rude lady. She quickly stopped me in the middle of my question and stated that the item was shipped from a warehouse, gave me a website and hung up on me.
B00FA5GZF4|5|Love love love this dress. I previously got the black one over a year ago and loved it so much, that I ordered the purple one this year. I get so many compliments every time I wear these dresses. The fit is great and conforms to your figure. Its a gently flowing dress that can be worn to work, or worn at the beach. I use the wash setting for cold gentle with very light to no agitation, and hang dry. The colors have not run and the dresses still look like new.
B00L6EJM5I|2|Shrunk after the first wash and only a little person could fit into them.
B005WX31HY|1|The quality of these gloves us very poor.  Within a month of wearing only driving a car 21 miles per day, the stitching came out.  The company did not honor a request to return them
B002H9W0HS|5|This is the sweetest little thing ever!  It is great for a gift when you don't know the baby's sex (so you don't have to buy something yellow! : )  It is SO soft and just really well made.
B00CJGD3K2|5|I wasn't sure if I would like these, but when I put them on, the fit was terrific. Snug along thighs and just a little looser in the bottom of leg (not a lot). It's a dark wash, which we larger ladies tend to look better in than the lighter ones. Comfortable. I sat down and felt quite good in them. I'm 5'6 and these were long enough not to look highwater or cropped (sick of that look) so I could wear them well with sneakers, flats, or a lowish heel. I wouldn't wear them with high heels like in the photo (I'm not into heels), so I can't say how well that would look.<br /><br />Very nice. As I'm on a weight loss journey, I ordered them one size down so I can still fit into them later. I'm an appley/avocado/hourglassy sort of figure (big boobs, wide hips, nipped in waist, but overweight with poochy tummy.) That's how much I liked the fit.
B00C9IDHK6|3|It was what I ordered, however, I wish that I would have ordered the next size. The shirt fit, but not any growing room.
B007ZO9XFC|3|Exchanging it for a bigger size, this product  was pretty small fitting so order the next size up to be safe
B00K9MIIW6|5|Good fabric and good fit
B002HJ3FAY|3|They stay on great but the material is such that it rubs the bottom of my shoes and makes a squeak when I walk.
B008135WPQ|3|for being a 3X-Large, it shrank terribly- doesn't fit my son at all after a few washes! :(<br />Big disappointment!
B00O9LLXXY|5|Love this shirt. Sexy yet comfortable. Low cut and loose. Runs a bit large. Perfect for a girl who lives on the beach.  Fast shipping. Happy me!
B002OL3NNO|5|What can you say about it really? Exactly what the picture shows, sizes are standard and fit as expected. Lovely shirt for an awesome show. Good hunting
B00H40UEDC|2|Woah! The other reviews said it ran big but that is a serious understatement - it's HUGE!! I'm sitting here wearing size 10 jeans. I ordered this skirt in an 8 and it's still way too big. Maybe a 6 would fit, but they don't seem to make it in that size so I guess I'm out of luck. Darn! The color is adorable and the quality looked great - but not for me.
B001JBH16K|3|Fit was just a bit too small, but they are still ok...
B00JDQ2UHI|4|Love it/ August 2015  Update 11/03/15  while I still like the belt, the end that was trimmed and placed in the buckle is no longer stable.  I have had to trim down a new piece to get it to feel stable.  This looks like a problem down the road if I need to keep trimming.
B00LO2TWY8|5|exactly what I needed, not too thin, but not a heavy wool sock.
B00L3Q6130|4|Great product; just as described. A much cheaper alternative to original Oakley lenses. Fantastic fit. Wonderful customer service. Recommended.
B00FIYFMI8|2|Nothing to this jeans, I will love to buy a pant with name. I bought a jeans much like this one at Saks for $5.00, it is better sewn and fit.
B007WADUVC|5|I love wearing it. cat lady for life
B000P55RJO|5|Excellent
B00QMFGG0K|5|Great color, light weight, stretch to them. Perfect shorts
B00JQGKB7Q|4|Thx for delivering that package and it's what I expected.I'm too excited and thx a lot!!!!
B00STXIWNM|5|Excellend shirt; just as expected.  Nice quality.  Fun design!
B001CCIY9E|5|Had so much fun in this costume.  Won best costume prize.  Sizes run smaller than I envisioned so make sure you size up.
B00XR25ADK|3|Great suit for the price. Was shipped the wrong size twice but they worked hard to get me the right size and quickly refunded me. I am 5'4&#34; 130lbs  34C chest and ordered a medium. It is a little tight but not uncomfortable. No padding so if you are shy this might not be the suit for you. Colors are bright and true to image. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.
B00NO6CJ2Y|1|Too small, and its a queen size. I ain't even that big, lol.
B008AHJAE2|4|I do not use the belt that came alongside, but the fit is as I expected.  Weight of the fabric seems good enough to last.
B00MAMTV6A|5|Perfect
B004270UIY|1|They have all torn down the sides already and did not last very long at all. Will not buy again.
B00I9TL72E|3|Ok
B00BT9MO4Q|4|They are GREAT quality; surprisingly... If they shrink, I won't be able to wear them though. I will have to find out.
B00TATKV38|4|I like the style and size of the shirt. It is a little snug around the waist area when I sit down. Guess that gives me some incentive to loose some weight. I have noticed 2xlt shirts seem to be cut slimmer than a regular 2xl. Not sure if that's intentional, but if I buy a regular 2x it's too short and if I go up to 3xlt it's too long. Overall shirt is well constructed. I haven't washed it yet, but will update after a few washes.
B001SLKYA6|5|nice sneakers
B005UVM3CM|5|great fit, nice material (durable feeling and not too thin), flattering fit, better quality than I expected.  glad I bought this!
B00T7HX2YS|5|Darling outfit! Quality construction!
B00CP805UU|5|loved it when i had till my old bestie stole it
B00J2PIX6C|5|i just got mine today i was super excited it took a while but i love it !! it fits just right and it looks just like the pic thank you so much !! Love it &#60;3
B007HJG36M|2|I read most of the reviews and most were great so I decided to purchase 3of this bra. At first it was good but after my ladies would slide out during my busy times of the day.
B00UPBZNAQ|5|Super cute and made of a soft cotton.
B004G0ABUO|5|This little footy is so cute!! :) made well and soft.. Will keep your little one cozy! :)
B007BG9Z66|5|My son loved it on Xmas day I will be looking at more of the same products for his B-day soon
B003YPGQWE|5|I love this hat....I look pretty darn cute in it while keeping my head warm. This hat was so worth ordering.
B00QLDJ8AI|5|love it!!
B00FJ5LW6M|5|Larger than my old aluminum wallet. Plenty of room for cards and dollars. Hope the clasp lasts longer than the old ones as it appears to be the same clasp,
B00YT9T2IY|3|I also have a large head 23 inches and this XL hat was somewhat tight fit. The sizing chart was a little off.  It's bill is thin and the card inside feels flimsy. The tag says it's 100% cotton, which may be true for the outer fabric, but the inner lining is synthetic and not going to let your head breath. @ $28 it's overpriced, bases on feel and fabric quality alone I'd have been happy paying $17 for this hat.
B00I2ZEQAA|4|The only thing I didn't like about this top is that the fabric is a bit thiner than I normally wear, but I love how it fits and the color is great! It's my perfect saturday shirt with yoga pants!
B0018OY5X0|4|These jeans are good quality. The fabric is strong but thin so I don't get to hot, I live in Texas so that's important to me.    Update: I just ordered another pair. I see many reviews complaining of the thin material, I think these people are used to the old 569,s. These are great jeans.
B00G9BBPIU|5|LOVE this sweater! I'm 5'1 100lbs and ordered the small/med. I was nervous it would be too big but it fits great. Looks even better in person. Lots of compliments!
B0001475YE|3|I wear an 18 and bought a 4X. The fit was perfect. snug, but not pinching anything and causing pain. I do wish that the wires or whatever they are were stiffer because it rolls and doesn't hold shape as much as I had hoped. It's just ok. For the price, I'd probably try something else.
B000HVTDZA|5|I had shoulder surgery and was unable to wear panty hose for awhile (couldn't pull them up.) Thigh High's are the answer! A friend bought some for me and I'll be a user from now on. They're so much easier than panty hose and they stay up well. Wish I'd known about these years ago.
B001JBNDM6|5|comfortable
B0006JAMK8|5|It's light weight velour- not heavy and hot like terry cloth or plush - just right for Florida's climate. And it is washable  and zips all the way up. No gaping when you move or sit down as tie robes can do!!  I've been looking for one like this for a long time and could never find in stores.
B009GH936K|5|The product I like for that I fill my expectations indeed thank you very good product everything what queria from Venezuela
B005GYGGY4|5|Nice weight for warm weather, not too thin if you get your correct size (5'7&#34; size 12 - bought a large)
B00D8VR98Y|4|Anything animal-themed, my Girls like. This is for the 17 yr. old.
B00L5IQ5LY|2|This item fits very small. I suggest going up a size for this one.
B00AKBFOJG|4|I love this robe it's very comfortable, the only drawback is the sleeves are a bit generous and not a great robe to do housework in
B00JW564AO|1|Awful, and ugly print.  Make me look like a cow and I'm far from fat!
B00HESUF9M|5|Fit very well...I'm taller than average and they are plenty long enough. Much better than expected
B00AMTEX02|5|These are awesome! My 12 month old is constantly ripping off his socks and with these on he obviously can't! He stays warm all day :) AND there are grippers on the bottom so he can't slide when he tries to walk on our hardwood floor.  Plus, instead of paying $15 I only had to pay $4 with the add-on feature. SO HAPPY! NEED MORE!
B00D1G60KY|2|It was my first time purchasing this brand. I am a 38DDD and the bra fits well but is uncomfortable due to the underwire sticking me under the arm area. There is stitching at the end of the underwire to keep it in place but the end of the wire sticks out and pokes your skin because of the lack of sufficient padding. I bought it due to the good reviews but I would not purchase again.
B005LJH0E4|5|They went straight from the package and into the wash - am wearing them now.  super comfortable.  I am 5'4\\"/122 and the small petite fit perfectly (another review helped with sizing - thanks!).  so glad I found them, will be back to purchase more in different colors.  Update since last review: love these, just reordered in grey - another reviewer indicated that white was \\"see through\\" and panties would show, ordered grey instead of the white.  Update since last update: I now have the grey, black, and the white as well as the initial purchase of the olive.  The other reviewer was correct - panties will show through the white, as I found out while wearing them to the grocery store.  Nothing like having your floral print panty briefs showing while you shop (boy was my face red).
B00817ECB2|5|Love these. Shot in the dark purchase and its worked out great, except when tinkle time. Tough nav in front
B003U660EG|5|I really like this one, it's nice and thin. The design is pretty awesome and the shirt is very thin.<br />I think its a pretty awesome shirt and recommend it, if you want a 3oh!3 shirt!
B00GPLKS78|3|expensive...the quality does not match the price actually although looks not bad
B00KYORHP8|5|This is a great tank!  I'm a 34DD and long waisted. Shelf bra tanks are usually too short overall and have way too little room in the shelf (the shelf usually hits me mid-boob).  This tank fits me perfectly with nice coverage for the shelf and a good, long length over my hips. I'm really pleased with it any will likely order more colors!
B00K7W2G44|4|great
B000TVQXU6|5|I bought these socks 3 years ago at Ross dress for less for about 5 bucks. Just got back from my run and was thinking about it. These socks have maintained the exact same shape since I bought them and are showing 0 signs of wearing down. The only difference is they lost their softness but I don't care. These are the best socks I have ever bought.
B00CW9QB1O|5|Washes great, fits the body perfect no Baggie look! My daughter loves this hoodie and wants them in more colors!
B006PHXUOU|4|I like it better than a traditional folder over wallet. It's slightly thicker than I thought it would be, but it is about the size of a mobile phone and fits well in my pocket. I like the look and feel, and it holds enough cash and cards to be useful. Definately not a carry all!<br /><br />Feels solid and knowing it protects from RFID is a nice plus.
B00KSZQ13W|5|Can't believe you had these for such a deal. I bought all the colors I could. Thank you for saving me so.much money. Champion Super hoods are the best investment you can make in winter clothing.
B00J7THBV6|5|Lovee them
B00BRBTT8K|4|I love this dress but the bottom is a little see through.  Not perfect for all occasions unless you wear a slip. But it is very flirty and professional at the same time.  great buy great price
B0009UL0QE|5|Fit and feel great so far for what im wearing them for.  I would buy more definitely.
B0078ZGD3S|4|This shirt is pretty - looks exactly as it does on the model and fits true to size. It is pretty sheer - even the double layer in front. The back is completely see-through.  My only complaint is that it can't be worn tucked in - you need to wear it out as in the photo. It's a very nice fabric.
B00E4FHRD0|1|I would like to return this wallet. I hit that wallet by mistake. Their was another one I wanted. So please help me return this one so I can get mk wallet I wanted. Please help me!!!!! I don't know how to return this wallet!!!!
B0082N3DWO|5|Great purchase!
B00JYCLIYC|5|fits my husbandperfect EXCEPT thru the brief area....he told me they felt a bit tight on his lap/brief area.
B00HIENZ9Y|5|Very well, i like, good item and seller
B00Q2ICQ8I|3|They fit well, but just a little shorter than expected. I'm 5'7 and they were just barely over the knee. Still cute tho.
B00BM1GGW2|4|very stylish
B005CSORVI|5|Great quality item
B00939U59A|5|The very best sock I have ever purchased and also very warm!
B00DQ3IKUA|4|Fits perfect.  They look and feel great. Only thing the button in front didn't last very long.
B009AMA0JA|5|The product met my expectations fits beautiful.
B00GKCAQW4|3|Comfortable shirt but not true to size.
B005TF0A9W|5|I was worried that they would be too big but they look great and I love them. Thank you for shipping so fast too. I wanted them before my wedding and was so happy when they came in before my big day.
B00QF327DY|4|Cute and adorable, armpit area felt a bit snug, love the piece.
B00KHJQCMY|5|Love these socks so much!!! Will order some more!!!
B000N3RTMQ|4|Fine, as expected.
B00L2L7IFG|4|Very nice shirt, looks great on.
B00GAE0JXS|4|Love it
B000PF46TQ|4|It was bugging me where I'd seen this cat before, it's from Emily The Strange.  This is NOT one of her four cats, but similar.
B00SBBZ3PC|4|I loved the style and design of this dress.....the top was very flattering....however, the skirt was too small and clingy across my back.end.<br />Also, the fabric was quite nice - but unfortunately I had to return it because it was too small in hips.
B00K6R6J9I|5|Well made!
B00ET7U0A0|5|Love it!! Was very disappointed that they were out of the brown so I had to get a black one but it is amazing quality, very sturdy, wore it all day at PAX last year, walking around a crowded conference center all day and was fine.
B0010Z3BR8|4|An OK item for free! I would not of paid what they want for it plus shipping, but since it was FREE, i'm ok with it.(The cooler is the BEST in my opinion)It's kind of a thin towel, but if i want a heavy towel, i'll go to wal-mart & get one for $10.
B000A2KDNM|5|EXCELLENT!
B007KZGGJ2|5|Disclaimer: I am not a runner; I do not know how this would work with running.  I am over 50 with a very full cup shape and the sagging that is inevitable.  I have tried tons and tons of bras; this is the first one that I absolutely love.  It gives better support than my previous &#34;everyday&#34; bras.  It minimizes a bit (a definite plus for me), but does not squash or squish boobs together.  The bra straps hide well under all of my clothing.  The double-layer construction does not hide all of the cold weather nipple look, but does a great job of minimizing it most of the time.  The 4-hook closure in  back is comfortable and does not dig into my back.  I wear this daily, including to work, walking, roller skating, bicycling, on the elliptical machine, and lifting weights.  If I were positive that I would never change bra sizes again, I would buy 100 of them!  Note: I wear a 38DD in most bras and the 38E in this bra fits perfectly.
B005MXHQXO|2|nt worth a tinkers damn material wise  a paper towel is just as good dont waste your  money on these..
B00AJIRZFQ|4|My daughter really liked the dress.  The quality is not great but the price reflects the quality. A belt would help spruce it up.
B00EPM5L8A|5|I really like these
B00NPVSOT0|5|Item delivered on time, was as described, great product, i love it !!!! Thank you Excellet
B00M18OKN2|2|It look very cute , but I order size 6 and<br />  6- 12 months arrived.  not happy i return the item
B008E7IA12|4|this is the most comfortable thing to be in after the pool or at night in the summer. So comfortable. Only negative and why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is it's very long (and I am tall) and it seems to stretch and get longer as you wear. Other than that they are fab. Ended up buying 3 more of them.
B0058JGKX4|4|I ordered these socks with several other items. I was quite surprised that it took them 12 days to get here. It wasn't on back order. The socks are fine. They always are, but seems to be a long time to wait for socks!
B00FERUJMS|3|It wasn't as long as they said but it is comfortable to wear.its an ok buy.
B00O1D6SDU|3|sent me the wrong color, otherwise fits well.
B00I6CR778|3|The fabric on this shirt was odd.  It felt rough and stiff.  After washing (and not drying) it shrunk up and fit my husband like a belly shirt!
B00D5YSVMC|5|Very pretty
B000WJXDAI|4|The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because they sent me the wrong version of the costume (still really cute) . It was a little large but nothing that looked strange and everything was included. Make sure you get the version in the picture though.
B00GTY9PT8|2|This size should be Baggy, but it's not. A sweater would make it too tight. The sleeves are so narrow through the forearm that there is no room for all but the thinnest of long sleeves
B00MGFBRM2|5|Medium is a child's size! Got a good laugh though. Great design. Shame I won't be wearing it again. Lucky charity shop!
B000UU4BLY|5|Very nice. Runs small as I bought it for a 12 year old boy it fit him perfectly even though men's medium is usually a little big.
B00B1HQQ7M|5|Shirt fit as expected and was true to size. The shirt fit and looked great, I will be buying more.
B00E9AOIIW|5|Best Pants Scrubs i love it so comfortable and i&#34;m a person that so picky on clothes not complaints so EVER!!!
B00B58TWZ0|3|Quality is outstanding, look is as advertised, however they are somewhat tight at legs. Not what I expect from a relaxed fit. This is subjective experience but reason for only three stars.
B003BSQQQU|5|My son is 6 w a waist of about a 9..clothes are always long..from reading others reviews..I got a med 10-12..when not washed..they were kinda long..but I washed and dried now they are perfect
B00CXJO0TI|5|This robe fits as described but the material is a little thin...you would not want to wear this around the house if you have nothing else on underneath (unless it's just you and your significant other). Other than that, the robe is comfortable and the material is soft.
B00CF6MR12|1|It is very big and I went by the same sizes I wear in all blouses.  Won't wear it unless I have something underneath it.
B00JARMYOO|1|wow.. I ordered the medium but the T-shirt is too small and of doesn't fit at all. I will be donating for a 8yo kid
B007F358B6|4|These booties are beautiful but extremely small. I ordered this for my newborn and I suppose she will be able to wear them for about a week or 2. I love the quality of this item and it's antiquity. 4 stars because of the size.
B00QT505KA|5|I love this sweater!  It is light and dressy enough to wear to work or for a casual weekend!  Definitely thinking of buying another!!
B001EOINXC|5|Nice and delicate.  Looked lovely with my black dress.  Lighweight and beautiful color.  May buy in additional colors. Most appropriate for a Summer's night when it gets a little chillier.
B0060MXY9Q|4|My girl loves it and it is comfortable, the size I bought was 5 but fits my girl and she is 3 years and a half..
B00YEA51XS|4|Ended up being a little bigger than expected.  But otherwise really cute and comfy :)
B00A8DQADA|5|My son love it!! Its exactly like i expected... The colors are the same ...and its long sleeves but fresh
B008J1YD82|5|Great product! Fit very nice and snug, with the sizing exactly how I expected it! Fabric is very soft and stylish, as well. Thanks for a great product!
B00WQNGNT6|5|Good
B00KRMVUMI|5|I was not expecting too much for lees than $20 for this robe. It looks exactly like the picture, vibrant in color, material seems like it should last a while. Happy with my purchase :)
B00DZ7PT8S|5|many people say that this wallet is paper but this wallet is supposed to be thin but it is an amazing wallet especially since my son loves archie comics and he is a huge fan... amazing quality
B004QDNX1A|5|Pretty heavy duty mask. Great quality to ensure that it lasts a long time of play! My little brother loved it!
B005PQPWDY|5|The pants wear well and fit comfortably.  Would buy more of these.  Wash with few wrinkles.  Good colors for my wardrobe.
B00PLCL2P4|5|It's gorgeous and comfortable.
B00Y3GTLZW|5|Nice light stretchy material, keeps u cool, the part that connects the fron & back is wider than most so it dosen't dig in.<br /> The olny thing I don't like are the big letters on back. Men's thongs have too much material, & cost twice as much!<br /> I have a 36&#34; waist, med fits fine. Hand Wash & line Dry!<br /> Will buy again.
B00MYAGLUC|5|Good quality, fair price, happy I made the purchase.
B00CKN7Q2A|5|This is my second shirt from Allegra K that I've ordered from Amazon, I love them both but this one is exceptional! It feels and looks like high quality!
B00E1HHMI6|5|Extremely durable and comfortable watch. The luminous dials make the watch easy to read at night, and allow the watch to be attractive without being gawdy
B009653O6C|5|It is the perfect sweater. I have actually bought this in grey, black, and blue.
B00PZG6BLG|5|May look too big when received but fits perfect.
B008HAZYGK|5|excellent
B00ICMVCF0|5|This is not a durable or high quality constructed item. It's a little thin and very lightweight. We purchased this and used it for a Warrior Dash run, it suited our needs perfectly! A fun novelty item that is easily expendable. The helmet fit an average adult male head.
B00YAISHWQ|3|The hem on the sleeve came out after the first wash...
B00JGT2LIK|5|This dress is just a little tight in the arm. little adjustment, I love it!!
B00FREMQCY|3|Runs a bit small. Very light, perfect for summer.
B00IBJ3SR4|4|What can you really say about lobster socks?
B007RGD2UK|5|My Dad wheres a xxl so I got a xxxl to be safe. He's Slim but has a beer belly so it fit Great and he loved it for father's day :-)
B00BK4MRZ6|5|I totally loved this purchase...received several compliments on it...the quality and colors was exactly like the picture.....will definately buy from this seller again.
B00MO9BC8Y|5|Amazing!!
B00GBT8QM8|4|Cute
B0041188T4|3|This hat is more for show than  help with the cold.  It is also not long enough in the back to cover the neck - requing a scarf and that detracts from the the overall appearance.  If you want your ears and neck warm, this is not the hat for you.  It is still cute and fun to wear.
B00RYPDB3C|4|I'm a size 16 (pear shape) and I bought the xxxxl.  It fit perfectly.
B00KLGOXAG|3|Cute because of the Dr. Who connection, but really awkward size and shape of you mean to use it for school books.
B004GCIN2U|5|Unlike a lot of my other sports bras, this one fits snug enough to offer actual support. Feels just fine when I'm working out.
B00N4M5PCY|5|Thanks
B009K1OA3S|5|Looks hot on my beautiful wife!
B007C2PVVW|2|I was warned about Gerber sizing bit I didn't listen. Order a size bigger than you think you will need.
B003VWCSMW|5|Seems that Jeffries seamless are just the right prescription for our princess... no fussing at all.
B0088P457I|2|Everything fit me besides the top it was to big around
B005XZXXP6|5|My husband and I ordered this jacket for our nephew who is currently deployed in Afghanistan. It arrived just over a couple of weeks time which we thought was good, considering it's destination. He likes it very much and the colour suits his uniform. He said that it is warm and keeps him dry especially now that temperatures have dropped.
B001OGRCUK|3|The quality is great but the size is too large for everyday use. If you wear a large I suggest getting a medium sized one. Besides that I love the hat its great and very unique and original look.
B003NT0R2G|5|The dress itself is beautiful and I was not disappointed  with the appearance or quality.Gorgeous dress as advertised. However, I had to return it twice which cost $14.00 each time because it was manufactured not true to size. It was created for the petite, skinny Asian woman, thereby making an XL, which I really am, equal to about a 12!!!!! Next I was sent a 2x which ordinarily would swamp me, and it fits like a 14!!! I am now sending it back and requesting a 4X which I hve NEVER been! If this doesn't work I will request a refund. My point, there should be a way that the manufacturer can let the client know :\\"this garment runs exceptionally small\\". However, I was super impressed with the rapidity of all the transactions. Exceptional! However, I have spent $30 out-of-pocket above what I paid for the gown.
B00IA6ZGDW|5|Love the Tshirt ! It's super cute and perfect for a Harry Potter fan ! Fits comfortably!
B00551OS70|4|comfortable and supportive without uniboob.
B00JWLUJQS|4|Nice
B00EWTT0VA|4|This item fit with some room for growth which what I expected. Nice shirt, I would definitely purchase again.
B00EDCHY7I|3|These feel...weird. They're too soft. Kinda like sometimes chicken is too tender, knowwhatimean? Also they're just a smidge too small but I'm expecting some stretch with wear.
B00I02ELB4|4|Have to cut the tail as it is too lon, but I like it
B00KA5NLTC|5|Given to my nephew as a gift, he ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!  Fits perfectly!
B00J5DET1E|5|Thank you
B00BDGETF2|5|The dress fits comfortably. It's a great color even though it looked lighter on the picture but I am still pleased and like it very much. I am around 5'3&#34; and it fit right under the knee which is perfect. I would definitely recommend this dress semi formal event .
B000NHW378|1|The swimwear came fairly slow the string broke really I'm not very happy. Would not buy again. :(
B00M92IDRY|4|Fits great and looks great
B00HFGODNW|5|It looks great . Thin enough and fits great
B002QRG7WK|5|Very nice but it does run large.  I recommend buying one size smaller than you think.<br />These belts are well made.
B00R5C0IPI|3|They're okay, I probably wouldn't use them as actual compression shorts. They also shouldn't be one size fits all, it should be broken up into 2-3 size ranges so they fit better. But the are comfortable if they fit well and are very inexpensive for the decent quality. Overall an okay product.
B00CFR3YHC|5|Fits great!! Love that GRUMPY CAT. A fun shirt to wear and gets plenty of commenets. I love it!!! COOOL
B002RS6A8O|4|Like everyone else described it, pants run larger than actual size. Purchased size small and it's too long. Nice material though!
B00KDGJVNS|5|Great!!! However do they come in other colors such as.......gray, red, blue???? For matching brasss????
B006R3GO3G|3|Its a nice dress .. I advise the customer to buy it because it is nice for girls and it is same in pictures .. I like amazon very much , they send a good guality for me and same what I chose
B003G30WZ6|4|Nice pants for an office environment. Not too dressy, but not too casual either.
B010GC6K6Y|5|The shirt is exactly what I was looking for. Good quality, excellent<br />fit! Will definitely buy more when the time comes.Thanks!
B001FOR2D8|5|great
B003TVO6FM|4|They run about a half size smaller than the other pouch underwear on the market. But they are much nicer.
B00NVEST4G|5|very cute...love it
B002N2JNCO|4|Just what I wanted.
B00ZDMNN22|4|The headband is a little tight but if you put it around something to kind of stretch it out it fits better(: I love it! And quick shipping! Got it in 2 Days.
B008JHB3RA|5|Just what I ordered. My friend loves Cow print anything and she was very happy we were able to find socks just like this!
B0087UHA8K|4|Wig was pretty nice and arrived quickly.
B0012QQWCG|5|Fit is perfect, quality is high.  After trying these out, I will definitely buy more. Not much more to say.
B00K31MV8A|5|LRG has the best gear period so happy with this brand my god their design concept is so out of this world. Ecko,Roca Wear and Coogi have nothing on this brand they are in a league of their own every thing they make is a head turner very dope brand..
B00A3HFUMI|5|Excelente
B006VG17FE|5|its light, its long, and it keeps me warm during the winter. for its price, its a great buy.
B00UJVY3IA|2|The lenses are blurry. It's like they are dirty all the time. The fitment is great and they shipped fast.
B003CMXD84|4|It's like you either have michael jackson high waters or my toes are covered when it comes to tights.  I would rather too long than too short so overall I like these tights.  I needed them for a backpacking trip in the cold and they worked well.  Too long to wear under a dress without hemming (which I am not that into).  I wear a 33-34 inseam on my dress pants for perspective.
B00RVYBU66|5|I love this scarf, full of color and great quality.
B000VZP9D2|4|Ordered one size too small, the product otherwise is very good. However I am still wearing the vests which as far as the quality and feel is concerned, is second to none.
B00CQ4BNH2|5|We sought out these newborn gowns when my little girl was a week old. The 0-6 month gowns are great but they ride up on the teeny tiny ones. I found these with the large elastic and was so glad. They only fit for 4 weeks but that was okay - they filled a need. I moved into the larger ones at this time and found they worked perfectly. Best gown we had for newborn and I highly recommend Carter's gowns over other brands.They wash well and are very durable. Love that they have the little mittens you can pull over the hands as mine tore mittens off her hands!
B00NIHNDFG|4|love it, not so much the price
B00A9SBSWW|5|This one is seems like real silk out of all the others, although they all say 100% silk on the tags.  Arrived on time and as describe but you can't beat the price.
B008Z6D7AQ|5|This shirt is great has pictures of all the Doctors on it made of high quality matreal enough said. Nifty.
B00CMWJXOS|4|Ordered several sizes for my school age daughters, so far so good none of them are showing any signs of wearing thing or stretching.
B003XKNC0O|5|Sensual, I love seeing my girl in this, definitely a turn on when I see her on this plus plus !
B00SC5SS4U|3|These skirts are very sheer & they run small.
B006FKS1T6|5|I JUST WANTED A COMFORTABLE BRA TO WEAR AROUND THE HOUSE
B001G2E85Y|5|It is easy to buy, I received it quickly, before the estimated time.  I loved it!
B00AK8H1RC|5|My grandson, who is 6 adores the Skylanders, and loves wearing his Skylanders shirt.  It was a good idea for a birthday present!
B00QTD3U5E|5|Great bag! Well made and a perfect fit for my Nikon D3200, all accessories and a 13 inch Mac book pro, probably enough room to fit a 15 inch one as well. Perfect bag for traveling very lightweight.
B00B5BHX76|5|The tie clip has a simple but beautiful design line.  It looks far more expensive than it's price which makes it a great value.
B00KDA4HQ0|4|My stats are 5'2&#34;, 120lb, 35-24-36. im usually a small but A medium was perfect on me! the cups arent comfortable. but its a great deal! shipping wasnt fast but it didnt take forever either
B002M88PVO|5|My son wore this all winter and it still looks great!  We washed it several times.  He wore it from 18 to 24 months.
B00MHO80MC|3|I say &#34;somewhat small&#34; because I ordered a size larger than normal, XL, after reading the reviews, and it fits like a LARGE. The top is narrow for an XL. If you have a few extra inches around your middle, this XL size will be snug. The material was not soft, as some have said, but I washed them with Downy, and they are OK. The inside of the material is softer than the outside. I wanted the elastic band around the ankles to keep them from riding up as other pajamas do, but the openings, unstretched, are 7 inches across!!  Way too wide, I will have to sew them up the side to make them tighter.
B00NC6X5AQ|1|No stretch at all.
B00CNKPKB4|3|I really love these pj's with their fun designs and comfort.  I am disappointed, however that after one wash and a week's worth of wear, there is a hole in the arm seam.  I am not sending it back and I will sew it myself, but it was a disappointment.  Fit, comfort, and designs are great though.
B005CSOX62|5|Excellent product it's very good. I like because it's high quality and has good price. Isn't expensive. And the color it's very well
B00VL3K172|5|Great quality
B00B6EAR0C|5|Warm, comfy, love it! Seems to fit true to size. This is the third jacket like this I have, love the color
B008XG4G8A|5|I usually wear a medium in tops, but I ordered this in an X large and it gives me the coverage I need, as it does in the picture. I am 5'2&#34; tall and about 150 lbs. with a 34 D bust. The item is good quality. I purchased it in black to wear to a formal Jack & Jill wedding shower. The material is light-weight and comfortable. I would buy again.
B00K4WRY8K|3|Arrived with a hole in the crotch area where it was miss by the seamstress who made them...should have been caught in quality control! Otherwise, cute horse print...
B00M7KGH1W|3|I usually wear a small, I ordered a medium it was too big. I sent it back and got the small. It fit the only problem is the lining does not come all the way down to the end of the shirt, thus you must tuck it in, unless you don't mind showing a little skin. Or if you wear pants that are high waisted which I don't . It is otherwise well made, the cut is a bit boxy, it didn't flatter my size 2-4 frame. It made me look larger then I am.
B002EH7SMU|5|At first I thought this bra was a bit pricey, but after purchasing one and wearing it I decided it was worth the money and bought more. I've been wearing them for a year and they have held up well. The Cafe Latte color is pretty and does not show up under white blouses. It says to hand wash, but I've been putting them in a lingerie bag and washing them in cold water on the Hand Washables cycle. I highly recommend this bra.
B000ARG1KQ|5|have been looking for these socks for 25 years glad to have found them again will buy mopre in the future
B0027UZ0NI|5|I hate padded bras and these are great inside your bra to keep your nipples from showing through my tops.  They stick to the skin well and I received them promptly.  I highly recommend getting more than one set because the adhesive loosens  after about two months if you wear them everyday although you can actually still use them still inside the bra but when you take it off they drop.  With the adhesive you pull them off.
B00R7PYFXY|5|Great product!
B009OA4V20|3|I ordered these for my then 12-month old (who is now 13 months). She is in the 50 percentile for height and weight, and these fit her, but probably not for long. The quality is fine, and the patterns are cute. We use them as undershirts in cooler weather.
B00E8GR6L8|5|In response to Whirledpaez's review below, I must confess I haven't ordered this either (and I don't usually go around reviewing items I am not familiar with).  But I am giving this one 5 stars for unexpected truth in advertising.  The tacky tree ugly appears to be exactly as described, which is more than can be said of many Xmas products.
B00CIFY20E|3|more like ivory color, not white
B00ID4RBOS|5|Great socks!  I wear a size 13 shoe and they are the perfect size.
B002AQ27XK|4|These pants are nice just a bit small for my husband.  We will try to exchange for another size. Dockers always wear well so it is worth a little back and forth.
B00CQ4T61M|5|I LOVE this so much! Definitely buy in the next size up or else it will be too small. It hasn't shrunk in the wash at all, and color hasn't faded and it is very comfortable. I feel like a real demigod in this :)
B00M746Y98|5|I love this product!  What a great idea, and they do exactly what they say: prevent chafing, staying where you place them.  I'm off to order another pair!
B00KX84ZJG|5|Good product!
B00E2570B6|4|I'm kind of between a med and a large. Comments recommended ordering a size up, I did and the fit is pretty good.
B00117WX2E|5|They arrived on time and fit right around them with a little effort. But once their secured on them it makes a big difference with the noise. No more jingle bells if your in a hurry.
B008CXLG8M|5|Great for yoga and dancing.
B00AQN1YU6|5|I bought this in two colours. Very comfortable and sexy. Perfect for layering or wearing alone as I do. Thanks
B001UJLMM0|4|I really like the size and look of the bag a lot, but the only problem i have with it, is that since it is wool, the material balls up. It makes the purse look raggity. Also, I thought that the purse was leather free, but the straps are leather. I am still using the purse, but wish it didn't ball up so bad.
B002SK5GZE|3|I was really excited to find compression stockings that weren't 50 dollars!  I have to wear them all the time for a heart condition and really needed something lightweight because I live in AZ and its hot, of course.  I was pleased with the quality for the price I paid, it made it easy to buy several pairs to have on hand for washings.  However, they are much less comfortable to wear than the sigvaris ones that I purchased (that cost 50 dollars)  The texture on these wasn't as soft, or as sheer.  But they are definitely a good value buy.  They do seem to run a little small though, so if you have really small legs, don't assume you need the smallest size and get 5 pair like I did.  Get one pair, and then try them and order more after you see if you like the fit.  I have REALLY small chicken legs and the size A cuts off my circulation around the toe and calf.
B00CXOV53W|1|Everything I've bought from Motherhood Maternity is complete junk. The material of this skirt is thin, see through & quickly developed holes at the seams.
B005E1MRSS|5|Very nice leopard print! The only things I would say are that the &#34;push up&#34; does not push up all that much (compared to other push-ups I've had, it's not BAD, but it's not a lot of padding either) and the bottoms are cut a little short on the sides (I have a huge butt so if you don't you probably will be fine). Excellent, cute, sexy bathing suit overall though! Glad I bought it :)
B00Q1EEBG8|5|Love it!  Once you get over the sizing of it all, this suit looks AMAZING on! It is very flattering for those of us with CURVES! It accentuates in all of the right places.  I just got it so I cannot say much for the durability, but the quality seems good.  I was hesitant to order a bathing suit online, but was reassured by Amazon's return policy so I took the plunge and am so glad I did!  For reference I am 5'2&#34; 145 lbs C cup and definitely PEAR shaped! The size I ordered was an XXL(US size 10-12) and the fit was perfect, snug enough to feel secure, but not make you feel like you are stuffed into a sausage casing!
B00FS5LMYA|5|Great
B00SH4VVD6|5|This t shirt is just what my daughter wanted for my grandson. I ordered the green one, would like to see it in red but that was not available.
B005S6BU3W|5|Bought this for my first (and only) grandson to wear to my niece's wedding.  It is very good quality, very detailed, and exceeded my expectations.  The only concern is whether or not he will be able to fit it come February.  He's only 5 months old, but already wearing 9 - 12 month clothes!  It is absolutely worth the money.  You won't be disappointed.  It is every bit as cute as he is -- and that is past the legal limit!
B00PS8DZOW|5|Finally a sock which does not leave a mark on my baby's legs!
B0025USKH8|3|It was hard to find a solid colored black or blue robe in cotton terry cloth.  It is also hard to find size XXL.  This was just about the only one that met my criteria.  It will work but not that happy with the large looped terry that snags easily and looks cheap.
B00NCSPG7Y|5|Excellent dress! So glad I got one for each of the granddaughters...very well made and so pretty.
B002V90EPE|5|amazing, I like
B0080IYHEE|5|I totally loved this backpack. I liked the materials and all the different pockets. The only problem is that i get dirty really fast.
B00VJ51CP2|1|If you looking for Gworld brand this is not it. Just using their pictures to sell copies
B00F20YD56|5|Beautiful print and fabric is nice and flattering. Can be more formal or more casual - possibilities are endless! It is quite long so take that into account.
B00HJDIZ3U|5|Excellent
B005OJZXKE|5|I gave this to my daughter. She loves it. Well packaged, came on time. It keeps her very warm in the cold weather.
B009DKMXTE|4|It is a funny prop. I really like it.
B0051D8JVS|5|I already had 2 pairs of these jeans. When I first bought them, I wasn't sure I would like them because they are not all cotton. I was pleasantly surprised about how comfortable they are.That was 2 years ago. Those jeans still look god an fit well, so I bought more.
B00HG9K8VY|5|I wanted a pair of briefs to wear in the summer cause the long boxer type gets a little to hot under the jeans.  So I opted for these.  Just as great a support as the long line.  If you've never tried Obviously Naked products, you're missing out.  The material feels great against the skin and the pouch, well, let me say it makes my ego swell every time I pull my pants up over the bulge I now have in the front.  And I'm not a huge guy at all!<br />It's worth getting a pair and see how they make you feel.  I've been back for several more colors.
B0050AFXC0|1|Nice
B00P0DQ0EW|5|I LOVE this! It was hard putting it on the first time,  but after that it was easier. I'm 5'8 and 178 pounds and I ordered a large. It fits perfectly! I recommend this to any woman looking to waist train without having to spend a bunch of money.
B003EAHFAG|4|I love these briefs for my son.  They fit well and seem to be of good quality.  I would order them again and/or recommend them to others.
B00J5A1726|4|I'm rather tall and thin and was pleasantly surprised how snug they fit, plus I'm 5'10&#34; and they were plenty long.  They arrived on time and met my expectations.
B00KJDMR3G|5|Fast service and what I expected!
B00K3N1SZK|4|Graphics are great and the material although a bit thin in texture, good quality.
B002UUYFE0|5|I've always wanted a denim bucket hat since my sister first had one 20+ years ago.  The thing is I have a big head and finding one that would fit was going to be a challenge.  This hat arrived today and I immediately put it on and haven't taken it off.  It fits perfectly.  I ordered the L/XL and with all my hair it still fits over my big head. I think I'm going to pin a flower on it and enjoy my summer this year.
B0030KPUW0|1|This things will not stay on my shoulders and kept falling off and I would find them in my bra.  Don't waste your money on this item.
B008724GTE|4|The boxer trunks were great other than they are a little big and the string front looks nothing like the picture.  The strings are very long and distract from the sexiness.
B00BJ9BCWG|5|I ordered a large (which I am usually a small or med) after reading the reviews and it was perfect.  Love the material and color.
B005I33OZ2|4|Fit well and warm so far.
B00P6A7156|5|LOOKS NICE.
B00QIYOR4W|5|Extremely flattering...EXTREMELY!!! Especially with leggings and a tunic and boots. I don't recommend this with jeans but that is my personal opinion. It could be the best thing that ever happened to you and your jeans! But it is a control garment, so anything with lumps and bumps is going to SHOW said lumps and bumps in detail and I found it quite unflattering.<br />LEGGINGS???? Oooh, a whole different story. I looked hot. I am not vain, my husband said that I looked HOT, and that lets me repeat it as hearsay without vanity (LOL). But I will admit that I &#34;felt PRETTY&#34; in that outfit. I DO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CONTROL, LONG LENGTH CAMI, BUT &#34;Step INTO IT, and pull it up that way for best RESULTS AND BEST COMFORT! Otherwise it just sucks trying to put it on BECAUSE it ROLLS AND YOU THROW IT ACROSS THE ROOM (well, I did anyway...).  Best part to a 47 year old woman who has D cups??<br />Gives a lift to &#34;the girls&#34; that is SUPER BONUS. VERY APPEALING AND APPRECIATED. GOOD LUCK LADIES!!
B004OWMSYG|3|These are nice and soft, I bought my boyfriend a bunch of these shirts because he needed new ones, but they seem to wear out pretty quickly and they do appear to shrink a bit in the wash. For the price, they're ok and he looks great in them, they just don't feel like they will stand the test of time
B00B8YZ8RW|5|The colors were nice for the sweatshirt for my son.  the two-tone is nice and different. he enjoys wearing it and it feels comfortable.  shipped on time.
B001PU9A9Q|5|Love these!
B00J7UOWZS|5|Love it
B00AHCKKCO|5|Very nice
B001L961GQ|5|Ordered 4 of these in assorted colors and, although I usually prefer Nike clothes as they just seem to be made with better quality material and almost always fit perfectly, these Champion pullovers were ideal---and a lot better price!  It'll be a while before I need to order more but when I do, I guarantee I'll be ordering the Champion's, not the Nike's!
B00HVVK0QK|5|Love both items
B00BB1PJR6|5|Nahari veils are a delight to own, and versatile to use, mostly I dance with them - the colors are very rich and dancing with them is like playful swimming in ocean swells and furling waves. I have used the veils also as a lovely shawl in summer evenings and for curtains at home. Because they are so light they filter and subdue the light rather than block it , and flutter or billow wonderfully with the breeze. Thanks Tamsin for such a lovely product.
B0002TNE1G|3|the print is good. and obviously you'll like it. but the cloth is not as good as it seems. overall, a good t-shirt with which you can show off your love for metallica  \m/
B00X1JU8K4|5|My bf is in a David Bowie tribute band and I wanted some Bowie gear to wear to shows, so I snagged this top. I love it! Super soft and comfy, but also very cute, with a nice sassy/slouchy 80s style cut that makes it extra flattering on my curves. I wish more ladies' t-shirts were cut like this!
B003BXHPO2|5|Love this hat. It provides just enough shade for baby!
B004EM0FC8|2|needs an attachment at the bottom--slides up the bra straps
B0006I3MAQ|5|I like these as they fit nice and stay in place.
B00FVSB7RQ|3|These are well made & attractive.  However, they come from Australia & it takes several weeks to get them, not really a problem.  The only problem is that they run very small in size.  I usually wear a small but ordered a medium to be safe & while I could wear the medium they were too tight to be comfortable.  I gave them to my daughter who is 5'8&#34; and weighs 115, she is very, very thin & they fit her perfectly.
B00IJQNL4Y|5|this is the only bathing suit that fits me as I am a large size in the mid area and a smaller size in the butt area.  This is now #3 of your suits that I own (and the only ones that still fit me).  Wish you had a few more designs - thank you.
B00T1A6R7A|5|nice and comfy
B00CDC2RLS|3|The fabric is very nice and it drapes well, or would if it weren't big enough to fit two of me.  Normally I wear a large medium or a large but this thing, sized &#34;L&#34;, is more like XXXL.  I'll keep it and wear it as a summer nightie but am disappointed.
B00IMLXJNY|1|This was like a youth size t-shirt. I normally wear a medium or large and this shirt was WAY too small. The sleeves were minuscule and it was bizarrely short.
B000JVTVPK|5|I love these -- warm, soft, and adorable.  I highly recommend the 'super soft' Baby Legs....  they are super soft.  I also liked that these were not too long; I've bought several BL and some are so long I had to double them up.  These are just right for a ~1 year old, give or take 6 months.  Protects little crawling knees and makes diapering so easy.
B00LY0KTHO|5|love
B00M9BKGFW|5|Perfect.  It is just the type of thing to wear as the weather transitions from cold to warm ...  or from warm to cold.
B00EO99XQU|4|Nice wallet for the money
B003YZ2GG4|4|When you are very full busted and want a nursing tank, options are very limited.  Hesitantly, I shelled out the money on these, and while I like them, and they'll do for nursing, they're not perfect, and neither is the sizing.  Based on Glamourmom's size chart, I should have purchased a Medium, which I did.  I squeezed into it, but the spillage and cleavage was ridiculous.  I got a Large, and the fit was MUCH better, though not perfect--the band is a smidge too big, even on the tighest setting, but at least my boobs were contained, and I love the length of the tank top.<br /><br />I wear these all the time, so I feel like Glamourmom is price gouging the women that need more coverage and support that other tanks can't offer.  I'm trying to save up to have 4 of these on hand to be able to wear and wash, but with spit up and daily life, I can only wear these once before needing to wash.<br /><br />I give 4 stars because they provide the best fit I've found for a nursing tank so far, and it's easy to udno/redo when feeding.  If I were to rate the price and sizing, I'd give 1 star.
B007ZZJIUG|5|Love this hat. My son wouldn't wear a hat at all so I needed one with a tie, He walks all around putting it on his head by himself (he's almost 14 months). He must like it.
B0040T2RUS|5|I received one of these in a baby gift basket and absolutely loved it because it makes middle of the night diaper changes super easy. You're not dealing with buttons and crap and baby looks so comfy and snug in these! They run a little big which I like but my baby is long and lean, so it depends on your babies size
B00L4OC7ZM|4|These are great for everyday wear. Though they do run a bit small, they wear well. Washing as directed and the quality is holding up.
B0079MIJGE|4|My daughter loves it more than her team leotard.
B00F1RNAM2|4|it's a very thin shirt but it has little ruffles that makes up for the thin fabric. Very Cute.
B00BBFXH6C|5|This dress looks killer! Hugs in all the right ways.
B00IT63SGU|5|its very confortable
B003VWLBFC|1|I chose a light pink as the picture indicated and the gown is actually Pepto Bismal pink. I put it on hoping it would look better then hung it deep in the closet. Yuck!
B000WIIA5W|5|So comfy - just make sure to order a size down - they run big. I'm a 6.5 and the 6 fits perfectly.
B00T9A4ZEO|3|the pants are too wrinkly after wash.
B002QNOOEM|5|This groovin' v-cut bikini is awesome!  I love the hot color, minimal coverage, soft feel and excellent comfort of this very stylish bikini.  I highly recommend this item.
B00IA1SVXE|5|It is clear this is a beautiful dress so I won't focus on that, although I will say it is even more lovely in person. What I will focus on is the speed with which I received it, about which I am still shocked.I wasn't expecting this dress to arrive for at LEAST another 2-3 weeks, yet there it was, waiting for me today, in all its beauty. I am thrilled I purchased this and plan to buy from Lindy Bop again in the near future.
B00HZVQNW6|5|I am from Iowa and I live in Iowa. I work in a bar/restaurant and I get asked every single time I wear this shirt where I got it from. (I actually found mine at goodwill, then found it on here and purchased for a relative.) It fit as expected and I literally get at least one compliment every time I wear it. I am so happy I found it on amazon because when people would ask me where I got it, they'd get disappointed when I said goodwill- I can finally give them a place to go to to buy it!
B00AJUW72A|4|I'm happy with my jacket; the only con is that it's a little tight in the shoulders (I have broad shoulders) and when I button it up it's a little tight in the breast area because, I'm heavy breasted.
B00J63L2QS|5|This shirt came in a couple days early; so that is awesome!<br />Fit well, great quality & got to wear it out for an event :)
B00AFR9VFS|4|This is a pretty dress with a nice V but not too plunging neck.  Feels quite comfortable on and works for work or evening wear.
B00J83G53G|5|Great style and seems durable.  8 Year old son loves it.
B0037TIDY6|5|very nice.  am sure grand sons will get lots of use.  good quality.  the eye masks were a great bonus.
B005W0LTSA|5|Like
B001LLIFDG|5|This suit is now my favorite.  I swim daily and will replace my other suits as they wear out with this model.  I like the no draw string feature best.
B005901LDQ|3|pants fit at the time but after several hours of use, horribly stretched
B00HWUR4VE|3|I really like the comfort of these capris but they are pilling in the back side and thigh areas. For the price I wouldn't buy them again.
B00FAAFEHY|4|Very happy with my purchase!
B00LXEE9OA|5|Great fit
B004HH59S0|3|does not fit my wide bra straps as well as I would like.
B001HKLE7A|5|I understand that this may not be studio quality, but for the money you are getting exactly what you see. It looked great and was a hit at the Halloween Party. Ended up taking first place prize that night. The only item that had to be altered was the vest. I had to lower the vest approximately 4 inches (cost me only five bucks to alter). I was even worried about prosthetics sticking, but they remained on all night. Also, I noticed a lot of people complaining about the wig. I used a hair relaxer in the wig and cut a little off. Looked amazing. In addition: I am 6' 2&#34; and 215 lbs. I wear approx. a 46 coat. This fit perfect but pants do run a little big. Used a safety pin in back and they looked good.
B008DSNCDS|2|This shirt does not look as good as it does in the picture! It's thin, flimsy, it doesn't have any manufacturer's tags on the inside, and it runs small. In a case of very poor quality, you get what you pay for. Although it's wearable,  I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this shirt; to make matters worse they don't send you a return label or receipt so you're basically stuck with this item whether you like it or not.
B001LJUBYE|3|I dont think its a true Rolf wallet. All my previous Rolf wallets have had the name stamped in the leather. This one doesnt have that. This also has a brass snap to secure the picture/card flap, my others didnt have this. Dissapointed..
B00KPP6PV8|3|I'm 5'7&#34; ~140lb.  ~36/26.5/40.(ordered a small)  I have an hourglass shape.  This dress looks nice on me.  THe fabric leaves something to be desired.  But, you get what you pay for.  I would wear this to casual events.  A place where most people would be dressed casual, but I will stand out because I look really dressed up.  I wouldn't do this dress for a big outing that requires something of more substantial quality.
B00J8Y5TGE|5|Great for walking on the treadmill. No chafing.
B001JQMASO|5|These pants are darling. The stripe version of these pants are very soft and constructed very well. They are true to size, but stay rolled up if you need to. I especially like the waistband. They have good hold but are forgiving...not too constricting. We are going to get a lot of use out of these. Runs true to size.<br /><br />UPDATE - Zutano has recently discontinued the tapered leg style (leggings) of these pants in favor of the straight leg version at least partly to look more current and flattering. Be sure you are buying the right ones. The new ones are a few bucks more. I must say the elastic waist on the new style is much wider and overall better.
B00PHST43O|5|SO cute!!!!!!!!!!
B00KAWHK5Q|5|Perfect  fit.
B003Q3E4CS|5|It is a bright yellow that matches all my summer dresses.  I've worn it with green, navy, and blue and I've even worn it over my long shirts, letting it hang low on my hips.  Every time I wear it I get lots of compliments.  It might &#34;feel&#34; a little plastic-y but I actually like that because it hasn't ripped and I believe it makes the belt just a little more sturdy.  I LOVE this belt and can't wait to wear it all year long.
B000IMYG7S|5|I love this costume an I plan on wearing it on this coming Halloween. I wanted to point out that the skirt part is a tad bit short- especially when you bend down- but I found it useful to wear boy-shorts under it (like the underwear kind.. not literal shorts that boys wear). I actually plan on wearing the boy shorts over skin color tights and it looks fine. just be warned... if you have nothing under that skirt - you will be mooning people.
B007TYY28G|5|I bought those (4) to wear with leggings. They are perfect, and for the price, it's an incredible deal. Soft fabric, stay in shape after wash, cute, not too long, not too short! True to size. I really like the pockets, also.
B0018OFQ7E|5|Traditional quality--design, fit and wearability.  There're the same ol' Levi's.  Just what I expected, just what I received.  Thank you.
B0001FAXHE|4|Currently these are my favorite dress shirts. The fit runs better than most manufacturers (whose sleeves tend to run a bit short). <br /> <br />The fabric is easy to live with, wrinkles relatively little and is particularly well-suited to warmer climates (or offices with dismal A/C). These shirts also iron very easily. I am planning to replace all my 100% cotton dress shirts with these! <br /> <br />The shirt appears well constructed and no problems with overall quality. <br /> <br />The only reason it does not get 5 stars is the cut of the forearms. The forearms are not pleated and seem cut with a little bit of an inside curve. Guys with huge Popeye forearms might have trouble with the fit.
B00HK2XH8I|3|I like it
B006Z8HL76|2|Fitted and long, as pictured.
B000BRL0KQ|3|it is tiny. Maybe it is long in children sizes. I wanted something that would have ample room In the back. it is a very tight fit.
B008MBNNPS|5|My newborn wore this when we were leaving the hospital and he looked so unbelievably cute. I would buy this in every size if the weather agrees. lol
B0002M4S54|4|looks good and fits well.
B0098W8H92|5|I got this for my daughter for her school uniform. She is 5'3 and 114 lbs. The medium fit her well. The material is light and the shirt is form fitting and somewhat longer than most polo's which is nice. Will buy more!
B005LCDHJ8|5|Amazingly attractive boardshorts.  Light, comfortable and the fit is perfect.  I ordered an XS, am 5'2\\" and normally a size 0 in American Eagle pants. It also has a cute pocket in the back of the shorts to hold something small. Be warned though, the pocket is sealed with a velco, not a zipper, so don't put anything precious in there because it might fall out.
B003OQTYYU|4|Beautiful shirt. Sturdy construction. Heavy cloth.
B00OKRYZYG|2|Fairly shapeless, and fabric is too thin and polyester-ish to drape well.  Probably won't wear them, but they were too cheap to bother returning.
B00LFUM43K|5|So fantastic.  It is not an old lady skirt, but nicely covers
B00DT4QOYU|5|Im 6ft 190lbs and Its a little big as I got large but its perfect to wear with warmer clothes under them. Great fit.
B00RM0WSEM|5|The comfort waist band is exactly what were looking for.  All underwear rubs on my sons waist leaving raw sores ( maybe he has a sensitivity to elastic).  The only comfort waist underwear I had been able to find was the boxer briefs and those don't work very good with shorts, plus he doesn't like them.  I came across these and had to try them.  They were the best purchase ever.  My son has used them for two weeks and the sores are completely gone.  My son will not wear anything but these so I am now ordering a second package.  Plus you just cant beat the price.
B0006FSSKI|2|I am 6'1 210 pounds and this xl comes down to my knees.
B00J2C7QBS|4|Im 5'10 and 115 pounds.  I bought a medium..this fit as a small, im between a medium and a small, its a bodycon fit and long enough for my height which is good. I just have to be careful when i wash it hopefully it wont shrink to a shirt
B009KLOE8Y|5|Very pleased with the shirt.  Thank you!
B008Q0E61U|5|Great price and great look! Worth the money.
B00ICUNRUK|5|Its true to size and fits perfectly. Its a little dressier than I expected but I'll wear it on our vacation trip this summer. I would recommend it.
B00B4Z5CK8|5|I love this wallet! I needed a good replacement because of my old one falling apart. Glad I chose this one.
B001COCPOM|5|Great looking, comfortable hat. I suppose great looking is subjective but this hat is more comfortable than a ball cap and provides more protection from sun and rain. You can squish it up and then pop it right back into shape. It is made with 100% wool but is not itchy at all. I love it!
B005O0V12W|5|I love Dickies scrubs. They wash well, the colors don't fade too bad and I don't have to iron them. YIPPEE!!!
B00HAV7GSQ|1|This is not shapewear!
B009EGAE3O|5|The Sticthing comes loose, and the head is a little lopsided, but nothing you can't fix on your own.<br /><br />Fun wearing this in public, I get so many compliments for it haha
B001A3Y8V8|5|Chose these socks because my shoe size is 7 mens. The socks Iam used to wearing rated size 6-12 worked ok but had a gray heal. Because my feet are small, the gray always showed when wearing low cut shoes. And my wife would laugh at me.<br />So I ordered the 5-9 size Super 60. There's no gray & they fit perfectly.
B0064Y4CFK|5|I am 5&#34; 10&#34;.  I stuggle to find pants and shorts that fit correctly. These are perfect.  I will be ordering more.
B00E96E93A|3|Nice belt. Runs extremely small though for a 36 inch size. Sent back and ordered a 38
B004DUH6JQ|1|I purchased this 't' shirt for my son who loves fast cars.  It's horrible.  The imagae on the shirt is so hard to see.  The entire back of the car is black, put this on a black 't' shirt and you've lost half of your image.  There is no visible outline to make the back of the car visible, you only make out a small part of the top of the car.  Mix that with the colored streaks supposed to be the road and you have a mess of color.  It's a struggle to try and figure out what the image is, even when you know there is a car there somewhere and don't expect anyone to recongnize it's a lamborghini.  I though maybe in an abstract kind of way perhaps it look like a car, sortof.  My husband found that highly amusing and told me to return it.  Added 12/08/11  I have to make an addition to the above comment.  While my comment on the shirt still stands I have to commend cafe press on dealing with this issue.  They were more than fair with their resolution and I would deal with this company again.
B00HWPZ3LC|5|Perfect for teaching
B00IJAGIRW|5|My grandson is not born yet but I know when the time comes for him to fit into it he will so cute.
B006L8PRPS|5|I was not high quality but it did the trick and served my purpose. A cheap alternative to expensive santa suits.
B007R1Z87U|4|I'm 5-10 and they're just a tad too long . Otherwise a good fit (medium size) -- definitely a keeper. They dry very fast, but as some of the other reviews indicate, the pockets can fill up with water/sand since there's no drain grommets. They do have a double stripe and decent-sized pockets on the sides which aren't obvious in the pictures (I like them). Just a heads up: I have the the red and they did bleed in the wash like nothing I've ever seen.
B008MPZVOA|5|This shirt is awesome. I wear it a lot  and it has been washed a lot. I have not noticed any shrinkage and the graphics have not faded or peeled.
B00TYXZ8HO|5|Excellent
B001DNMNK8|1|Quality of the product and Amazon prompt delivery is very satisfied.
B001G6A12O|2|Not worth the money...feels and looks cheap..
B004RB37KS|5|The costume was great.
B000BOH7I8|3|The item fits very comfortably, but I wish it was a little tighter around the tummy area. I bought a small but it only tuck in my belly just about an inch.
B00VH5ZRI2|5|shipped fast, love em.
B00HN53CI2|4|It's large enough to put (if you wish) to layer warmer sweaters under it.  I like the zip pockets.
B009G818FI|5|Managed to purchase with 20% off as Scottevest have occasional sales. Had to pay about £20 tax which came as a shock but despite all that, the vest was superb on holiday and I wore it every day in hot weather.  The \\"weight management system\\" was extremely clever - feeling comfortable at all times.  Ordered large and was perfect for me.  Zips are good quality and the item looks much better than all other travel vests on the market.  A brilliant item which I will now wear for work as well. Delighted with it.
B007NLNESY|5|This shirt is adorable.  Im usually a medium shirt size but this fit was a bit small.<br />I would recommend going one size up
B00QY9E4QW|5|Very cute
B00CII4RDI|1|The print leaked out to the rest of the shirt making the white part look dirty. There return policy is impossible!
B00DN1PJFE|5|I love these socks, they kept my feet cool in my tall boots and looked great with my dress! I am very happy with them!
B009LLSDGW|4|I use this Top for my employees as part of a uniform.<br /><br />Pros<br />Nice fit.<br />Fits most bodies in the size range, although I think it runs a bit on the small size<br />Looks sharp, better than most scrubs.<br /><br />Cons<br />After washing you have to iron. There is no way around this, else you end up with a rumpled shirt.<br />After several washes, lets say 5, it can start to look a little faded, hence the need to iron. At this stage I start adding bleach to the wash to keep the whiteness.<br /><br />I'll continue to buy these for my staff.
B00857QBDA|5|I love this bra.  It fits great and had great support for working out and running.  I highly recommend this product.
B006MQGX1G|4|quality good.  granddaughter loved them.
B00HMBR53U|4|They seem to be fine. I hve only had two opportunities to wear them. They held up my pants just fine.
B00DWJKYTS|5|My 5-year-old God son had lost one of his gloves and needed a new pair to match his new green jacket.  I bought these and he absolutely loved them.  They fit perfectly, and they are all he wants to wear now.
B009NBA1BU|5|I read the reviews and the ladies that commented on it were right on. I usually wear a size L but because the reviews said it fits snug i bot an XL. Im glad i did. The abdominal area fits very snug n the arms are a little looser fitting. I really like the way it fits n will order more in different colors : )
B004TU75MS|5|The shirt fits great and is so comfy. I plan on getting more in other colors. It's a great price too.
B00DGYS7AM|5|The logo of superman is the best in this t-shirt. This item is very nice. :)<br /><br />Juan Pablo C. S.
B006HJJI4C|5|Although a little big, still fit, looked and felt good.
B00H0CNP4E|5|I love this dress. It's casual, yet elegant and fits as I expected. It is well made and the material quality is also good.
B004VHOP8G|5|As expected and arrived on time!
B00IS3UNB2|4|I like the bras.  they fit a bit tight, but they are usable.  They lift my boobs up a little and keep them in place so it's doing it's job as a sports bra!  would definitely order a size up next time.
B00KPUPBI6|5|Love the..
B00D6C86AU|5|I am NOT a fan of Halloween costumes because of their high price and low quality; however, this costume was very much worth the money. The bust area was a little too big so I had to take it in (I'm a 36C). It was comfortable, the feathers and fringe stayed on the dress and it fit like I expected (I average about a size 8). I was very pleased with this purchase.
B00TOAONZA|5|TO SMALL
B005GQCJYI|4|this was a great pair of shorts for a gift , they fit right, and everything they said was on it
B00A3HFVQ8|5|item delivered on time and in good condition.  prefer roomier work pants and cargo pants fill that need.  dependable brand.  comfortable wear for all day use.  recommend this product and vendor.
B00B5HNF0E|3|I like the material and for the most part, the shirt.  Before I got the shirt out of the bag it had lost one plastic pearlized snap top.  Two more popped off while in the wash and one while I was talking to a neighbor!  The inside seam on the front closure area of the shirt, had the frayed edge exposed.  After washing, I had to trim a lot of strings from the exposed frayed edge.  I guess if you are looking for that &#34;hay-seed&#34; look, this shirt is ideal!  It's OK for me because I do my gardening in it, so I don't care.  But with several snap tops missing it looks more like a $3.00 flea market find than a $16.99 chambray blouse.
B0016J9UCS|3|very nice shirt but tailored just a touch small in the arms and stomach area for some one my size
B00ECH10WE|5|This shirt is cute and comfortable. The fabric is so soft and the fit is great! I have a large chest, and it's hard to find empire waist shirts that actually fit. With this shirt, everything is exactly where it needs to be!
B0007Z6FTS|2|I realize the description says \\"approximately 22 x 22\\" but the 2 I ordered are both 19 x 21 1/2 which means you can't fold them diagonally to tie around your head.  It may seem like a minor discrepancy, but in my opinion these unmatched dimensions just make it look silly.  On top of that the shipping fees were ridiculous, especially for something that weighs almost nothing.  I was very disappointed.
B007RGCZDA|3|For this price, it is easy to find a branded tee in stores. I bought it since I fell short of time and wanted exact same words, Best.Dad.Ever. Color choices were good. I just wish the material was a little better and they had used some better brand t-shirt
B0037W704C|3|For $20 less I think I could have given this wallet 5 stars. It is thin, light and just enough pockets to hold everything I need, including a few bills, without an awkward clip, and secure enough that I am not concerned about losing anything. However, It is a simple design, with minimal materials, that in no way justifies the near $50 price tag. Also the particular one I received has some crooked/ diagonal stitching up the one side, and has already worn away some of the very beautiful, but EXTREMELY think finish on the leather. I can't imagine how this is going to look in a couple months or years, but as long as it stays together and holds my cards and money I will be continue to use it. Again $22 I would be ecstatic with the purchase. $42 makes it just OK, and if it ends up not holding up over time, I'm going to wish I hadn't wasted the money. I've had it 2 weeks and love the form factor over the bi and tri fold wallets I have used up until now. I will never go back! Thin is in! Eat your heart out George Costanza!
B00P9VO75E|5|Best tshirt ever purchased.
B003JJFR7K|1|These glasses are very flimsy and doesn't have a nice tight fit.  I would not recommend purchasing these glasses.
B00AZ9J2GY|5|Love this skort.  The color was spot and the length was perfect and the under short fits great.  Not to mention, the customer service was outstanding.  I ordered one size but received the wrong size.  I contacted the seller through amazon immediately and received a speedy response.  They sent me a new skort in the correct size and a pair of matching tennis socks to acknowledge the error and say thank you!!!!.  Even without the cute, very comfortable socks the service was great.  This skort was purchased to go with our team shirts and arrived very quickly.  I would purchase from this vendor again.
B00IOF6FDO|3|Very cute but too small for me.......
B007XGE0ZK|5|Fits perfect. Bought this for my Bob's Burgers Tina Belcher costume.
B005H3IX7M|5|Just what my wife wanted.
B007DJ2PHM|4|Good print on shirt. Decent quality! It's a shirt you would buy at a concert. What more could you ask for. A little spendy but it's iron maiden !
B009F6HNG4|5|I love these socks!  I wish that I had ordered more!  They are great!  I exercise and run.  These socks wick moisture so your feet stay cool and dry.  Please put them on as a deal again.  I promise I will buy them.  :-)  They are absolutely perfect.
B00QT6J9F6|2|Fit and fabric are great. Very soft, almost silky.  BUT.  The shirt has a tonal, vertical white striped pattern.  It's not solid color.  Which pretty much prevents it from being worn by itself.
B00NPYM83U|1|The color is not bright, looks like a really old dress, the neck is too small compared to the rest that is too big.
B0067OSVNG|3|This is not the smooth, comfy microfiber I was expecting.  It's lighter, more &#34;knitted&#34; in feel, and snags very easily.  Construction is good, color is true to depiction.  Size is somewhat small in fit.
B00UM5OBM6|5|Love the look and the feel. I am tall and fit so I have to order the larger sizes to get the length but I don't mind the looseness. Who wants tight fitting pajama's? They are well made and I am sure they will last.
B00ACIHDT6|5|This is a quality product at a good price. Perfect fit.
B00MN99YFI|5|love them
B00S7ZU9TW|5|Loved this
B00NS1M9CA|5|Got this for my boyfriend because he loves Pikachu and he likes beanies. Perfect fit!
B000ECXZHE|4|this is a nice basic swim diaper. lightly lined, light color with no pattern so it doesn't show through her suit.
B00DSVBR7S|5|I love it! I ordered one pair. It's comfortable because of the super soft cloth, and it's very stretchy. I got the perfect pair for my yoga sessions!
B00655SBK0|3|The front of the shirt looks shorter than the back.  I'm not sure if this happened when the graphics were pressed on or what.  It's also not 100% cotton so it's not going to shrink a little as I expected.  This is supposed to be a gift and I'm not as excited to be giving it now.
B0001YRWO2|3|They fit, and will work just fine. the description is matching. and even though the tag size on the overalls says 46X30. they have ALL got to be 46X32 cut. I have ordered exactly the same type for work 2 or 3 times now but these I am having to roll the cuff of the legs up on. If this is my biggest problem though I guess I'm doing alright.
B004BDNXZ6|5|I thought they were true to size and figure flattering.  Great for a teenager..cute with boots.  Bought them at the shore in a greyish color and fit so well we saw these on amazon (much less expensive) and bought them.
B00NRXXM6G|1|would not recommend
B006SF2DBU|5|Love this bra! Have one in black and one in nude, they fit like a normal bra and look great too. Very supportive, well worth the price, and a must have for anyone ( like myself ) who's breasts become obscenely huge while they're nursing. I am normally a DD cup fitting into an F 5 months postpartum
B00MXUNIN6|3|ok
B009YRKLYA|5|Great quality. Happy with the colours too.
B009L2ZK5S|3|This jacket was overpriced in my opinion because in no way was it warm. It was a sunny day when I wore it and about 55 out...its paper thin not warm at all...feels like wearing a long sleeve cotton t shirt.
B0076S9MIK|4|I had never tried a flex fit hat though so I was a tad skeptical. I'm sure the s/m would have been too small. Too bad there wasn't a m/l size.
B00CB2LXTC|3|not bad
B002R0FPI8|5|The jacket runs large so if i had to order again id pick a size smaller. The color is great and the jacket is thick and sturdy.
B00CJG99Q4|5|Got it in blue and love the fabric and the look. It is pretty see through so don't forget you have them on depending on where you are changing. The fabric breathes and is good in the heat or when working out.
B00CQ4CSBC|5|So cute and good quality with vibrant colors. The only issue is it already fits my 3 month old nephew.
B00FZYI87S|5|I love this wallet! It's everything I was looking for. Great quality as well.
B00377V5PM|3|I got these for postpartum use.  They fit fine, but left a bulge of fat at the top of the underwear that I do not have, and it actually looked better when I was not wearing them.  I ended up getting a waist cincher, and that works much better for me.
B0009MZV5I|5|I bought these socks to do a 100 Km in 24 hr bush walk/scramble (known world-wide as the Oxfam Trailwalk).  Apart from being ever so slightly larger than my size (maybe 1/2 size), these socks fit really well and feel really good.  They did the job brilliantly keeping my feet cushioned, comfortable and dry.  With other socks I had to double sock.  Not with these - they were great all on their own.
B00P4CAHSO|5|FITS PERFECT AND VERY WARM. BEEN LOOKING FOR A WHILE AND FINALLY FOUND THE PERFECT HAT FOR ME
B008FB9XOA|5|It fits alright just my size.i like it very much!the quality is awesome.thanks a lot!
B007G752ZI|3|I wear it whenever there's threatening weather. It does the job well.  I'd llke to see a velcro tab for rolling up the hood when it's not in use.
B0006TVYRI|3|I like the color; it's a real green, but it seems that the shirt is a 4XLT not a 4X
B00UWNQO5U|5|I love these, they stay in place, and nice to add a little extra in there when your small to begin with.
B00AW83HM8|4|i am a usa size 14 ddd bra size so the bra area is a little small. dress is very light and comfy.
B009B5ON80|4|very good quality
B00FZXKPNO|5|I love it! It is exactly as pictured. I was worried that it might be a little long on me as I am 5'1&#34; but it falls perfectly. The material is lightly stretchy so hugs you in all the right places. It comes with a black thong and the floral details hide the nipple area nicely. It is a very classy piece. My boyfriend loves it too. I can't wait to wear it to the lingere theme party we're attending.
B00IOPNN2A|5|It is what I expected
B01001JOUK|5|Really like the way these fit and feel and they look great.
B00FYEVLYG|5|Good product at great price & quick delivery!
B00CHIYEN2|5|This is so feminine and sweetly romantic. The fabric is beautifully embroidered throughout, which must be seen to be appreciated. I love the cap sleeves and scooped neckline, it's so very flattering. I am 5'4&#34; so the length is a little longer than shown in the photo, which I prefer. I could probably have ordered down one size to a small, because of the cut of the gown, but am pleased with the medium too. Very pleased with this purchase, worth every penny. I love it!
B00KOLVKYU|1|I THOUGHT THIS DRESS WOULD FIT LIKE THE PHOTOSHOPPED PICTURE BUT IT WAS NO WHERE CLOSE... TOO LARGE.
B013GMEXTC|4|They are really tight on my four year old but still wearable. At least I don't have to worry about them bunching on the soccer field
B006GFXTZG|4|These are very nice and comfortable jeans. Like the other reviewer said, they do run a bit large so I would recommend going a size down unless you like them to fit a bit loose. These are made of spandex and denim (well, I think), so, you really need to get a size that fits right for them to look good; otherwise, they might not shape to your body the way you want.<br /><br />Very flattering even if a tiny bit large.<br /><br />If you've never purchased Big Star jeans, you are missing out. They are very flattering to the figure.
B00IU61F9Q|3|Bunches up a little strangely around arm holes and bust with a model who is 5'2, 104 pounds, 32A.
B00F8K2GIG|5|These were a gift for my brother.  He wears them everyday and loves them .
B0082MO1GC|4|This product appears to be good quality and work as described. That being said, my child (5 months) still removes the gloves fairly easily. Luckily she does try much, but when she does try she can get them off. I think the product needs to have a much wider elastic area that extents up the wrist a few inches. Maybe a little spandex would keep the product in place.
B007TS220C|5|The shirt is awesome and was shipped just in time!<br />My brother loves it! Can't find any regular show merch in Canada!
B00Y00WNWO|5|very cute, in good quality. my daughter likes it.
B0091J1PY6|4|The pants are mostly viscose, but drape and feel like twill.  Hefty material, quality far better than the picture, European menswear style, low rise, longer than normal, with a belly area one size larger than the size listed.  Should be easy enough to insert 2\\" non-roll elastic into the waistband, but you'll have to be careful to cut the elastic much shorter, and you'll have to sew both ends of the elastic in front carefully, since the front is a hook and zipper closure.  Or, just take the sides in.<br /><br />Very surprised at the nice quality.  In an effort to shrink the belly area and length of the pants, I washed them in hot water and dried on high cotton heat.  They did not shrink.<br /><br />Pockets are shallow (two in front, two in back).
B00NUZHZO6|4|This dress is amazingly gorgeous!  I'm a size 10 in dresses but had a feeling I should order a 12 from the look of the material (which is nice and thick), so I did.  Glad I did!  The 10 would have been too small.  So I recommend ordering 1 size up from your usual size.  Very figure flattering.  Excited to wear it to a wedding next month.<br />My only thing is, the &#34;jewels&#34; on the neckline look very fake, from close up anyway.  Also, the center jewel is off center on my dress....hopefully no one will notice.  And the jewels all look like if I mess with them even a little they will rip right off.  One or 2 are slightly detached right out of the bag.  Nothing a little hot glue couldn't fix if any fell off.  I just hope they don't fall off at the wedding lol.<br />Amazing buy for the money!
B00BJFKS5W|5|Im 5'3... 120 lbs...straight frame....it was perfect fit These are super cute!!...got compliments from several Asian women and high school girls asking where to find them....Im 46,lol!!!<br />The pants are comfortable and well made...no iron just wash dry and hang.
B00B2HOTG6|5|My nephew is beyond the moon with this great buy!!!  The cloak was great quality as were the shoes.  The mask left a bit to be desired, but as that was only one piece, not a problem.  GREAT BUY!
B00CLZ3EJG|5|Fits nice... true to size
B00H5UC1Y6|3|Heal sticks out past the top of my shoe.
B00NHQM9YY|4|These pants look great and feel great.  I haven't had them long enough to tell you how they last, but so far I'm impressed!
B00CUZVTFS|3|Large
B00D8RLW2C|2|The tank runs small. It  is very soft to the touch but has straps seen into the interior bust side of the tank, which I assume are to help hold the removable padded cup in place, but they are irritating and just get in the way if you aren't using that cup liner.
B00B51AY8G|5|in all the reviews people mention the size runs small.well thats because its a womans hoodie.the zipper is on the other side.i gave it to a girl and she was well pleased.a man cant and should not wear a womans garment.
B007H2UW2K|5|I purchased this gown on Friday and it arrived Monday! I ordered a small which is perfect for me at 5'4\\", size 4/6. The gown is beautiful and exactly as described! I buy on Amazon regularly and am not quick to give feedback on sellers but this one exceeded my expectations!
B00EFT2DP2|4|I ordered a large based on the reviews I read--these run a size smaller than posted.  I love it!  It is very thin and perfect for a spring/summer day covering and in an air conditioned office (although I sometimes add a sweater--the men in my office like it cold!).  It also helps hide those hip pones, yet drapes enough to not add size and to be able to show your waist if needed.  I ordered 3 or 4 of these and may go back for different colors.  I love the colors of these!  The price is right and it's just what I wanted for a vacation in the cool summer nights of Asheville, NC and the office.  I only gave 4 stars because I haven't had them long enough to rate durability.
B00BUG0SHI|5|Perfect fit.
B00N1PZJSY|2|It's sexy but the bra made me feel like my boobs are not big enough.
B009A55G0U|2|I loved these shirts until my last order. Everything was about 2 sizes too small. I'm not exaggerating.<br /><br />I wear a 2xL. I can squeeze into an XL, but it's not very flattering :) This shirt is at best a large.<br /><br />I've got half a dozen other Cubavera shirts in XXL that fit fine. This one I couldn't even button up.
B011IYHK86|3|Nice Design. But it is waaay too small. I am on the break point between men's medium and large. So I ordered large. This is not a man's large, though it may be a woman's. It fit like small. It may be supposed to be a snug fit, but this was not even close. It's going to a girlfriend.
B00FN90L7K|5|This wallet fits plenty of cards and still fits comfortably in my front jeans pocket (women's jeans).
B00YUEPRE6|5|So lovely i love this Thank you. really fits my body....
B00331GLLK|4|Bought this as a lightweight jacket for my boyfriend, it fits well, feels pretty waterproof, but is thinner than I thought it be, that's my fault though for not reading the description properly.
B00MBAKX0O|3|Everything was good for the most part, except some of the jewelry didn't last but a minute
B00D6OTNRS|5|120 lbs, 5'6&#34; with a booty and these pants fit GREAT in size small!
B00L38Y1QM|5|I have a white Irish full length sweater and it is perfect with it
B00DBJ73UM|5|This racer back tank top is perfect for my workout sessions. It is very comfortable & material allows me to breathe after a strenuous workout.
B00INTX1HE|1|It fit oober tight and I'm 121lbs and it doesn't look like a &#34;tattoo&#34; . Its  uncomfortably obvious that it's not being that the part with the bow tie was much tighter and a different shade then the rest of it. They offered me $1 when I asked for a refund but ofcourse Amazon customer service is amazing and saved the day.
B00NVHDHAO|4|I am in love with this dress! I was kind of scared because I saw another design of this dress that didn't have the best reviews, but this dress fits perfectly, perfect length, comfortable, and looks just like it does in the photo! Although, I am only 5'2 and 98 lbs. It came a little late (3 days), which is why I put it down one star, but I still love it! {I ordered it March 25 and it cam April 6, so pretty fast}
B00FHHONP4|5|I bought this shirt for a steampunk costume that I am making. it is light and it fits very well. I ordered it and it came in 2 days. I will say that I ordered white and it was more of a cream color, but other than that it is a pretty great shirt!
B007SOMD24|5|I just got this dress today. I bought it on Amazon Prime day for about $27 and I LOVE this dress. It exceeds my expectations. Very high quality and well made. I'm 5'5&#34; and weigh 145 and bought the S/M size and it fits perfectly. Falls to my shins so the perfect length for me. I may buy another one. Can be worn casually or for work.
B00CEFETUG|3|didnt like the pink
B00EI8WYMM|4|Fits well all day, and is well made and cute, sexy style, pretty colors, it's hard to find pink bras
B00YZKY69W|5|Excelente!!
B002CRYC4E|3|Looked cool and worked well for me for a while. But after about 8 months of use it has turned from chrome color to a dirty bronze color.
B0009MZVVW|5|I have ten year old Thorlo trail hiker socks that I still wear several times a month. Very long wearing and comfortable.
B003IFVKM6|5|At 4.99 this is a bargin it is very detailed and look alot like Zacks sword from FF Crisis Core. I espically love the attention to detail on the handle of the blade. It is not sharp except for the tip which is a little pointy and could do some damage if in the hands of young kid, as for the blade itself it is not sharp what so ever.<br /><br />10/10
B00A3I5838|5|Good Levi quality as expected.
B00JITPFVS|3|Nice outfit, but I wasn't shopping for children's medium.
B00O09AICM|4|The sizes run small, so I had to return the first one and order the next size up, but the product itself is great. Very well made. Don't order this unless you're not afraid to have your waist squeezed, because the corset top is exactly that. On the upside it really brings out my hour glass shape!
B001G8I1R4|5|This shirt is great.  Soft material and washes very nice.  Rock Bottom Golf sent it right out and I am very happy with the shirt and the service I received.
B00WUNCD6Y|5|This is such a lovely night dress, the fit was perfect.
B00UKRH3EY|5|Perfect. Exactly what I wanted.
B00B73G24M|5|Best underwear I've ever had. Fits right and doesn't bunch up, and it is also really soft.
B00CA26I98|5|Awesome shirt, the logo is a little bigger than I thought it would be, but it's still a nice shirt.
B009BRPV7A|4|Daughter loved it!
B00EI8XGNI|5|The color is not bright.  I like it.  I wished I had gone to a store to try it on to get the right size.  My mistake.
B00HTWTCWE|2|Too LONG
B00AL1WKQU|5|Quick shipping and a great product. My 84 year old Dad requested this vest for Christmas.  I had given him one over 20 years ago and he wanted a new one.  He likes this vest because it is warm for him without restricting his movements, it always looks nice and they last for years of non-stop wear.  Filson is always a good bet........
B00J9J81MM|5|I Love the soft  material color and the size! This is exactly what I'm looking for in an American flag scarf.
B004358CB2|5|good quality, fits well
B0012ZYEHW|1|Not as I expected especially from the chart sizing.  It was quite misleading and when I got the item it was too huge.  The swimsuit looked very attractive in the picture but when I actually got it was not half as nice, everything seemed wrong the bottom was too big and too full.  I was totally unhappy and ended up giving it away.
B00JTY2OLG|4|It arrived in a timely manner and fits as expected.
B00J4E2WG8|3|Cute, unique bag but it doesn't feel very sturdy.
B00M2URMK2|3|When this arrived I was excited. However, after I opened it up and looked at it, I was disappointed.  It doesn't look like the picture. The sleeves are really short. I decided to try it on and it wasn't too. Oh well, you get what you pay for.
B00BJHGHNM|5|I became a fan of Charlie Rocket through Amazon discounted prices.  My 14 month old is thin (20%) with average height (60%).  I love the way their clothes fit him and they are really well made.  This shirt is quality, great color, and soft.  It's one of my favorite basic shirts.
B006G7JXOA|1|i read the other reviews, but wanted to try these for myself. i was looking for some infant socks that my infant daughter (she is 4.5 months, so not tiny!!) would not kick off. decided to try these, but they are HUGE!!! i literally do not think they would fit her until 12+ months. these should NOT be labeled infant socks.<br /><br />that being said, they look soft, comfy, and stretchy. i'm sure we would get a good life out of them once she is older, but they did not serve the intended purpose so i am returning them.
B009GWVGZ6|5|I have bought a lot of zentai suits in the past but nothing fits like this one. Skin tight and very sexy...The front 2 way zipper is a plus.
B00NZXGIR8|1|No!No! Deplorable that you would continue to sell this murderous product after being made aware of what is used to make this jacket. Is your love for money so great that you would turn a deaf ear to the screams of innocent animals? Greedy!  &#34; How does the product fit&#34; you ask? Much better on the body of the animal for whicj it was intended!!!!! Stop it!!!!!! Now! Any one representing Amazon or North Goose Down....you do what you need to. Open the eyes of those who do not see! You know in your heart it is wrong!
B0006DQ2IK|5|Even though I didn't get my package. They still made the initiative to contact me and offer other options and that is a real business.
B009P9YQ84|3|One side is bright, the other very full. The sewn edges are thick and unpolished, not suitable for a 2, 3 or 4 point fold
B00MYHF476|5|ARRIVED ON TIME AND IT WAS WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.
B001JTARBS|5|REALLY GOOD GLOVES! Absolutely warm no matter what the temperature.
B0088CGVQ4|5|OH MY. Awesome looks outstanding
B001GX9E16|5|I purchased this shirt as a gift for my husband, who is a HUGE Doctor Who fan. We were not disappointed. The shirt itself is highly durable and did not fade or shrink after being washed. The image is absolutely perfect and as pictured. Great product.
B00FLY4GSW|5|I feel so fashionable.
B005JI8RZ8|5|Yes. Soft, absorbent, breathable merino wool is better than cotton or synthetics on hot days (and cold ones too).  Wool pulls the perspiration from your skin, then passes it out into the air or outer layers, so you stay cool, dry and chafe-less.<br /><br />I prefer this boxer-brief style (now the secret's out!) to either boxers or briefs- it gives the support of briefs, while protecting my thighs from chafing.<br /><br />Machine washable, but I suggest Eucalan as a detergent.
B000IBH9QY|5|I ordered this item like a different model of bibs that I have, and the fit is different, I have sent them back and order one size larger, the product itself is great, I am actually a huge carhartt owner and like a good majority of there items, from hats and gloves, socks, coats, sweatshirts and shirts, to bid overall, as I work outside for quite a lot of the winter doing my firewood, tapping maple trees, working Christmas trees, and removing snow, I put it all to the test and really like the fit and performance of there gear, and when I receive the lager size I am sure they will get lots of wear for years to come.
B00QQKGLYC|5|The dress fit perfectly. Very classy. I got lots of complements.
B00BYS1M3G|4|These are good sweatpants and fit well! They are slimmer on your legs but also not to baggy on your mid section so you don't look like Justin bieber. The only thing is they are thin. So if you are buying them for warmth I don't recommend that. But other than that they are very comfortable and look good!
B00JS9S7L8|5|Love this dress. Very slimming.
B00IVV1SWE|5|For a mannequin serves it purpose, and worth the bucks
B00BJOGONI|3|This was purchased for my wife. She liked how it kept her warm but the size was slightly big. She is five feet tall. Ill have to look into the petite size next time.
B008ATFTAY|5|So comfortable. This top is perfect. You can easily dress it up or wear it casual; shorts or pants. Very light weight. Runs a little big due to design, but overall great!
B00O6RGU66|4|Good
B00KRC3HY2|5|Love it!
B00D842DDC|5|The Nautica shorts were exactly what my husband wanted.<br />The size 38 fitted perfect and the color was perfect.<br />He wore them Labor Day!!!!!! Looked great.
B005NL5TN4|2|The size of the one I got is a bit large for what I have expected.
B003U2ST44|1|Horrible belt. Cheap leather made in China. The only good thing about this belt is the buckle
B004NSUOHO|5|Very cute set, washes well, cotton is soft and stays so even after numerous washings. The rabbit in the pocket is very lovely.
B000WVALGK|5|I'm on my second one (my dog ate the first one). These wallets are thin, exceptional quality. Seriously: it's the perfect wallet if you're not in to carrying but the essentials.  George Castanza need not apply.
B0051DR9Z0|5|So cute, soft and fits great! Perfect for my hipster toddler!
B0009MW1VK|4|I like it very much, I even got them in different colors.<br />They are good, better tan expected
B008LTGOP2|5|There is just enough slouch to this beanie-not too little and not too much. It is so cute, I get tons of compliements.
B00V5B8PT6|2|I bought this to bring to the hospital for the birth of my baby. I am typically a medium size and even eight months pregnant this is still very large on me. I think it will serve its purpose at the hospital, but will probably not wear it again. The fabric is rough and it fits big.
B001PKV5IA|3|get it in black, not this white one.  if really want white, then its fine, you get what you see.  holds up (after washing several times).  I abuse it and its worn in tough/rough conditions.  holds up, but keep in mind its a t-shirt, don't be running through the woods or you'll poke holes.
B00GM0T10C|5|Love, love, love the Grey's anatomy scrub top.  I have to say:  this top flatters me better than most of my regular clothes!  Haha!!  I'm not a small lady; I am about a size 16 so in this top I wear an XL, and it accentuates my bust, defines my waist and skims the rest of me.  Beautiful soft durable material.  When I saw how well this top fit?  I bought three more!!  And I'm kind of a thrifty person, so at $37 apiece you know I liked this if I bought more than one.  Highly recommended.
B005HEMSW2|5|This bag came quickly and is high quality. I'm using it as a stylish gym bag and I love it. The laptop compartment comes in handy, since often carry both my gym clothes and my laptop or ipad to work.
B005VDR07C|5|Fantastic fleece. Incredibly warm with a shell on top of it.
B00L24M6ZU|1|As you can see on my invoice it states black but I received a purple one
B00DTUO2YI|2|have ordered before and fit fine this bottom was too small. Have already returned them
B00B5UDV1E|2|Too small.
B00BJ7ED1K|4|I bought this tank hoping that it doesn't ride up like some many of my other camisoles and tanks.  It is a nice cotton tank and is a little bit long for my petite frame.  Otherwise, it is a nice tank to wear under a shirt.  I bought this in white and black.  It's sold by NY Lingerie.  Shipping was fast and it came well packaged.  Overall, a basic tank that meets expectations.
B0009KN2CO|5|Very nice jacket.  Have been looking for a lightweight waterproof jacket for quite a while.  Very glad that we ordered this one.
B009V1CG5G|3|It was adorable but it broke after wearing it for a day... It was cheap enough that I probably will buy a new one though....
B007KFZGFW|1|I had to return this bra. I really wanted it to work. Its so hard finding a sports bra with a larger cup size. I don't need a large band size, just the cups! However, this bra was too big. It was also really scratchy. It wasn't a typical sports bra, soft material. I can't imagine wearing it for any length of time without getting irritation!
B00D3E0Y7O|2|This dress is weird! While my measurements say I should be an almost exact match, the pieces of this dress didn't seem to make sense on my body. The bust was too large, the waist too tight, the shoulders too high (as in, too much fabric between the bust point and the top of the shoulder seam), and there was too much fabric in the underside of the sleeves, making me look saggy and baggy there. Not good. I think perhaps it was made for someone much taller, or much better endowed than I am, and so the proportions were all wrong. I did get GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, though, as I returned the dress for a refund, as another size wouldn't have fixed the proportion issues. Also, keep in mind that this is an inexpensive dress; the knit fabric is very thin and slick, and it looks a little cheap.
B00NF5PVCY|5|It's just so cute!
B00KVGY05E|4|I like it
B000GA903W|5|Very soft, smooth, light and  pleasant to touch fabric. My son enjoys his \\"Batman\\" pajamas.
B00TY64YCQ|4|Lightweight n reasonable price. It is very comfortable!
B0064YYFT8|4|Great fit. Perfect under dresses that are form fitting. The lace detail is flattering. Only down fall are the straps are too wide. So can't be warn with a dress with skinny straps.
B009TB1HIA|5|I purchased the white and black one too because i loved this one so much .. very cute, warm and comfortable not to mention love the look - have gotten a lot of compliments on it, thanks
B00JGHLFGG|5|Exceltne
B00HX9ZJXE|5|Just what my grandson wanted  said it made him so grown up
B00N50P6JW|3|I ordered this pair of Pajamas and they arrived intact, no damage to the shipping package.<br />We took them out of the package & knew immediately they were too small.  If you were to wash them, since they are all cotton the set would surely shrink more.  It is inconvenient to return them but I do not want a pair of new PJ's for my grandson that do not fit.<br />This is a good product, I wish it were heavier weight for the colder months.<br />These are not heavy weight PJ's.
B00C0P34EW|5|Brought this as a present for my grand-daughter, because she is truly a One Direction DIRECTIONER. She wears it everywhere.
B009LEFQ1E|5|I am about to buy a second one. The fit is perfect , and it hangs like a dream. I love how it swishes around my feet. The only slightly negative thing is the material is a little bit thinner then I thought it would be, but it is still durable and i love this purchase!
B007L3SYO8|5|Just as shown. The beautiful scarf light. Not bulky.  It is Perfect to head a little decorativeness to any plain top
B009H4716Q|5|Love this product fit nice shape nice does no stretch should off when up one size but very pretty with jeans
B00AFR2P8S|5|accordind summer, brilliant soft and light, to enjoy the beach, loocking for adventures, surely a good gift for my friends
B000FH43GA|2|This product certainly does control buldge but try to breath and you are in trouble. The product seemed well made but the design is much too restrictive. I ordered a medium (I usually wear a small) and I could not wear it.
B00GG3NXUY|5|Fit as described - I wear it to work out in.  Material is a little thicker than I would like, but overall I am very pleased with this purchase.  Quick shipping too.
B007W0XT1S|5|Very good should have bought 2
B005CSNUWA|2|Ok
B00KP965QO|4|Adorable and comfortable.  Fits perfectly too!  I had compliments on it immediately !
B00MN6WG88|5|exselent
B0064AAJMY|2|Blouse wAs good
B00EP6XAZM|3|shirt is very box like
B001AOJELQ|5|then my son and girlfriend decided to go to Hawaii so I gave her a chose of the ones I had for the trip. It was a great hit, she loved it
B007QQ2NFQ|3|The length was what we would expect, however the waist was tight. Adjustable waists are great, but these pants would be better with half elastic in addition to the adjustable waist.
B0059BIBP6|1|Fits like a Medium.  Ahh the French.
B00T793LLU|4|Comfortable, love the pattern and fabric, and my girl likes how they make my butt look!
B00JSLT1ZM|4|I liked it :)
B00P3U8DLK|2|The material is very thin and when I got it the button that was suppose to be attached couldn't be. Good buy for the price, but will have to put some extra money into it to get it fixed
B0007YXVQE|3|Great fit and wear gets a little uncomfortable after a 12 hour work shift.  But good bra!  Will think about buying another one!
B00SMWQ81I|1|Not women's sizes. Junior sizes.
B00HB2Q9OQ|2|The pants are very nice looking, however, after only two uses, the seam on one of the legs ripped, exposing a huge tear. I am very disappointed, as I do not know how to fix. It's not like my son was running / jumping around, etc. in these pants. He were them to church, so was sitting the majority of the time. :(
B003ES592Y|5|UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT GIVE A DIRECT REVIEW OF THIS ITEM, THE PURCHASE WAS FOR MY GRAND-DAUGHTER.  ACCORDING TO HER, THE FIT WAS GOOD, COMFORTABLE, WITH NO BINDING, BEING A CHEER-LEADER, THAT SAYING QUITE A LOT.  THANKS.
B00F4MZEAK|5|Very pleased with this beautiful and very soft feeling sweater, I almost don't want to wear it because it's so plush and lovely!  I'm very glad that I purchased this gorgeous sweater!
B009FVA3SY|5|😊
B001KMSQ4O|5|Good quality and fit, very cool shirt, get good comments on it every time I wear it, would buy again
B001FA1706|5|Beautiful colors, fantastic patterns! I always order two pairs of Ozone socks since the designs are so funky and fun!
B00KRP61Q0|5|Love it!!!! Fits well. Im a small in shirts and got a small and it fits perfect.
B00AGAJMCG|5|very warm
B00I03EOU6|3|I only used the tie which is so adorable! It's winter here so the shorts would be too cold. I think there should be a pants set as well!
B000SKP65Q|5|These socks are very soft and roomy in the ankle unlike others that almost cut off your circulation and leave those ugly marks.
B002ANO6BY|4|A bit on the big side and long for a short person like me but it is so pretty. A bit fragile but who cares.  It was a good price.
B00FVET9AW|5|I have not worn this as yet, but it is a great look for my dress. Very nicely packaged and I hope to wear it soon. The quality is good.
B00GQP2DZS|5|Super cute and perfect for cold weather. Everyone asked where I got it from
B00MZ1EENQ|4|Nice vest but it is a little small. I like the soft material.
B00KNQ87PQ|5|The Vorta has been my favorite pair of jeans lately. It fits as expected, and is ridiculously comfortable. It has *slightly* stretchy denim without it feeling like you're wearing spandex.
B006ZOCAO4|5|My 9 yr old was too big for the Youth Large so we tried out the Adult Small.  It was a bit too big, but better than too small.
B00HE8ESNG|5|when my daughter got the dress she was so happy and started crying. she loves the design.its a beautyful dress.
B007GR6GF8|5|loved it!!! i have broad sholders and have problems getting things like this... but this works perfectly and looks very nice and classy
B00V6D3SQ8|5|I love this thing!!I'm 5'4&#34;, 125lbs, am a size 3 and ordered a medium and it fit perfect everywhere!! I have quit a good size butt already,but wanted a little lift and this definitely did the trick!!would recommend!!
B00508YMPG|4|These are cute and comfy shorts.  The only thing is the drawstring is sewn in the back, so you can't adjust the length of the ties or actually pull them tighter.  I'll cut the longer one off, but thought it was odd.
B00NMXI8FQ|4|This is a good buy for the price. I thought the sizing was pretty true, maybe just a tad more form fitting than I expected, and the fabric is so thin it's a little bit see through - but I only plan on wearing it under button-down shirts for a little extra coverage so I don't see that as being a problem. Even if for some reason I had to take the over shirt off I would be comfortable walking around in public with only this layer on, as long as I wasn't wearing some brightly-colored bra of course! The straps are quite delicate, almost like ribbon material, so I'm not sure how well it'll hold up especially with constant or active wear. I only wear it occasionally and am satisfied with the purchase so far. :)
B00K5T76M6|5|Great!
B00A2TEKZK|5|Fabric won't wrinkle. Wrist-length sleeves. Comfortable and elegant cut.
B0072898TW|5|Love it.  The quality is not as refined as I would like, but I expected that since I ordered from Amazon.  Love it anyways. And it's beautiful!
B009ACL1EI|5|I bought these for my 3 month old son to wear in the winter so I would be able to change his diaper easily. He seems content with them on and is always grabbing his toes. They are a bit tight on his thighs but nothing to stop me from putting them on him.
B00I3VXBK4|4|Saved my face from frost bite when I hit the slopes in a wind storm.  Lift was eventually closed but I didn't feel a thing.
B00GFTFXTS|5|These shark socks were my son's favorite he is 13 and they fit him perfectly. They could be for a boy or a girl probably too small for an adult.
B00AW1EW6U|5|I purchased this trench mainly because it was on sale and needed a lighter wear jacket. I was pleasantly surprised when I received the jacket. It fits beautifully and looks more expensive than it is. Great buy!
B00J1O2ES2|2|Cute and fits right but made terribly. There were rips in the petty oat seams and a rip in the neckline seam when I opened it. Strings hanging down fr the fabric. Sewed by maybe a 5 yer old.  I didn't expect it to be perfect but for the price it's a rip off. I wore an old costume instead.
B00K5YRZHW|4|Awesome hoodie
B00FHPJSB0|5|ok
B00EP1FTTC|5|This is one of my favorites and it was a good value and came super quick.
B0076TOGCG|3|I expected the usual fleece style but this collar was ridiculously to big and the cuffs were elastic. Not at all what I expected.
B00EMG3VMC|3|Thin fabric
B009KY1TYI|1|These panties are NOT as described. They are 92% polyester and 8% spandex. NOT COTTON!!!! Do not purchase unless you want polyester undies!!!!
B00F48JQ08|2|The quality wasn't that good. The chain keeps breaking and the skull broke off. Kind of regret purchasing this item.
B007JW9OAE|3|I decided to buy these despite the price because for sleeping they appeared to be the way to go. They are comfortable BUT they make my head too warm.<br />The sound is fine. It's just what I expected. I found the company website so fancy schmancy I could not easily...looked for several minutes to find just how long the cord was. I sent e-mail to them via their support service and didn't like the reply \\"The cord is 48 inches.  Here are the specs from the site:\\"<br />If I could have found the specs on the site I wouldn't have asked and I don't need to be told they are there. Just send me the info...<br />Thank You for inquiring about our product the cord is 48 inches.....<br /><br />Probably most wouldn't have noticed but I did. I am all about customer service which is why I did.<br /><br />I take 2 stars off...1 for the price..I know I paid it and another star for the service and warmth factor.<br /><br />They are an ingenious product. Best though for people that would rather listen and run then listen and sleep.<br /><br />Thank You
B008O31RX4|5|This is light weight. Very comfortable.<br />I loved the hot coral color.<br />It has a good length and the pattern is very pretty.
B00XZUONPA|3|Runs small
B000EBLXQK|3|Ehh
B00GJ9C9MI|5|Great socks.
B00C0PIRAS|1|The bottoms were not the same that were shown in picture. They sent a bottom that tied on the side. The one that was pictures didn't.  Too fit bottoms were to small and didn't fit. I guess u get what u pay for. Won't be buying another suite from china
B00ATLKTOW|1|Way to small  an adult. Less then impressed but not worth the hassel to return
B0018POQGK|5|Growing up, and most of my adult life, I've preferred Levi's 501s.  I thought I had found my mainstay.. till I tried a pair of these 511s.. BEST PANTS EVER!! Wherever 501s would bag or sag, the black stretch denim grips and holds on without choking you. The universal look makes them applicable from church to onstage. I'll save all my 501's for knocking around the yard because these are my new Faves!
B0040FB3WA|2|First of all, I paid much much more for the two day shipping. Got it in like five days...almost missing the party it was bought for. Upon opening the box, I thought I had received the wrong thing. The color is entirely different. Its almost orange. And the face is sort of green-ish...which looks fake even if it is a mythological creature. Safety pins are a must, because the back is split open like a foot and a half. (this was something I expected from reading previous reviews though) Even the hair on the face does not match the photo at all. This wasnt an entire dissapointment, however. Everyone at the party thought it was amazing, and the dog's reaction was hilarious. Just wish the picture actually matched the product.
B002Q90BOS|2|among the six pair there's a lot of inconsistency.. Some are smaller then others.  What's up with that?  Seems like they should have a pattern for all low rise briefs size 34.  I had the same problem with the previous order of Jockeys.  Where's the quality control?
B0043O6JQS|3|This shorts are ok , but a little on the small<br />Side....dont recommend this shorts
B00JLSSYI2|5|Perfect!
B002G9UE3Q|5|i purchase this carhartt because I heard a lot of great things about this hat and use it for work .so far it does its job it looks good I would highly recommend this
B00UVTIO4Y|5|This hat is super cute.  It is everything it says it is!  I'm really happy with it.  The picture makes it look a bit more green but it is turquoise in color.
B00ZU6UPTU|5|I love it. It fits exactly as I was hoping it would!
B00DUAYM88|5|This is the most beautiful dress.  My niece loves it.  I matched it with the Brooks Brothers Girls 7-16 Metallic Tweed Boucle Jacket and she looked great, not to mention the price - outstanding value.
B004JV74VY|5|really loved the product, was just perfect on my daughter, looked good and felt even better.<br /><br />will always recommend buying from this store
B002C5I9GI|5|goes well with the fur hat i bought from there.
B00UMVAIWC|5|I ordered this dress custom size and the dress was perfect and amazing. My daughter looks stunning in it. It took only 8 days from when I ordered it to receive it. I added cap sleeves and it looks amazing. The dress looks a lot more expensive in person. The seller was on top of it with my questions, very easy to communicate. I highly recommend her business you won't be sorry.
B0055XFERG|5|i love the pant,it is so nice for me.love!  love! love! love! good price and nice quality.i will recommend  them to my friends
B001VU7FCO|5|I bought these as a gift for my younger sister (age 17), and she LOVES them! She loves music and these earring are a great way to show that! They might look a little heavy but in fact they are very light and will not weigh down your ears.
B0019CUKRG|4|This costume was very comfortable for my husband the the size fit him pretty accurately. The only issue was that the belt was so much smaller than the rest of the costume and kept popping off. We had to use one of his normal belts instead. Also I was surprised to see no feather on the hat. Other than that it was worth the price we paid
B004QEH4C8|5|But I still loved it.  I'm 6'3 so i knew the leg length would not be long enough but I just bought gold nike soccer socks and the colors matched almost perfectly.  The sleeves were shorter but most of the time i just kept them rolled up.<br /><br />Kept me pretty warm...almost too warm at the bars.
B000WW97YG|4|fit
B00453K4Z4|5|I have bought several items from this company for my teen age grandson. He is always very happy with the cut, style and fit! The clothes are of excellent quality.
B000P15I56|1|Fell appart within a week.
B005CSOHDG|4|I've bought champion sweats before and medium has always been too snug after washing, so I went for the large.  They are a real large and I probably would have been better off with medium, but These days I use them more for hanging out around the house, so baggy works better.  I love these sweats!  Wished they weren't so long, but I just cut them off.  Not everyone is tall folks!  I would love to see the day where sweats were sized for length as well.<br />If you're looking for the old fashioned champion sweats these are great!
B00D68NOWE|5|Exactly as I had pictured it. It came in very fast considering it came from China and I live in Texas. There is a strong latex smell on it but it should go away from sitting it out. I am going to have fun with this in public and I recommend it.
B001GG9EKY|5|Received them just in time for the sub zero weather that was  moving in. Keeps the wind out and the heat in. She loves them.
B00OO1WPHW|5|Cute
B004SKAY18|5|Love this shemagh, great material, very comfortable and it does what a shemagh should do... I live in the desert in Nevada and on a hot day, a little wind blows and feels like I have an A/C blowing on my head!
B00BIPVD52|3|Okay, so believe the reviews in regards to the shorts running small, actually small is an understatement. I ordered the large, size 12-14 for my 5 year old daughter who weighs 43 lbs and these fit her just fine, so.... you have been warned!<br />On another note, they are really cute. I like the smiley faces and hearts.
B00NNBSPF0|5|If you like surfer style for your baby or just as a gift I extremely recommend it.
B00ITGPEAS|5|This product is awesome, the hood you can pull down and make it a hood so you look like jack skellington, this product came in a cover up package so it wasn't just thrown in the box. The size is an adult size, so if your getting it for a child, expect it to be a little big. Its also very cozy, its like a snuggy, but a lot better!
B00NNR8AJ0|5|Bought these for Christmas P.J s ,the kids loved them ,very comfortable and true to size . Will buy again .
B00NMUOM04|3|The colours were nice, however I found they did not fit well to the front.
B00S41W8NY|5|Super soft and comfortable.  The pad inserts are too small for the bust so they can move around which is a little upsetting.  But it is adorable and so comfortable.  Also, it doesn't provide any uplift if that's what you are looking for.  But, it is perfect for something cute for a low back top or for comfortable coverage.
B00243Q96A|5|I bought this for my Guitar Hero-lovin, Star Wars fanboy nephew for his 9th birthday and he loves it. It's his current favorite shirt (score one for Aunt Didi). It was a good price and shipped extremely fast. I can already see that I will be buying the next larger size for Christmas.
B009GERQUS|5|You know you've lost weight when you have to go down a cup size, oh well! I have worn Maidenform bras in this style for years and you can't beat them for comfort. They come in several great colors and the soft material lasts, keeps its shape and doesn't get ratty after many washings; line dry of course as with any nice lingerie. This style is perfect for everyday wear, as well as &#34;date night&#34; because its a great combination of comfy and sexy. Comfort is top priority for me in a bra, second is the shape-wear factor (looks good under clingy tops) and third is how it lasts. All great with this one and 1/2 price on Amazon sale!
B00NV9FVFG|5|I loved these so much I purchased all the pants in this brand. Tried to save money by shopping at Target but the fit was horrible, these are definitely worth the money.
B00DMWQJ58|5|Came in fast and worked perfectly for my cosplay last year :)!
B005CSOXKI|5|Excellent buy and fit
B00R2T3CQ6|5|I love this large beautiful shawl. You can use it as a throw blanket in winter! Great price. Happy with this. I also love the green/blue colors.
B00QWFCAT6|5|Love this. It is very comfortable and fits well.
B004A7XY2K|5|It's a very comfortable brand of underwear, not much else to say. It came on time and just love the fit.
B006M6789M|5|Smaller than I expected.
B00A3ID0LU|2|These shipped very quickly, but they are very THIN so be careful because while pulling them up, my fingernail(very short)caught the fabric and ripped. This happened 3 times in 3 different places. I ordered true to size but the waist part is really big and therefore when I pull them up over my waist, the pockets come up quite a bit over my butt area (not cute)but I will only wear them around the house now. However I must say that the leg/calf area does fit a little snug for me...I'm not sure if its just my calves ( I used to be a runner and still have slightly larger calves) or if that area in the pant is smaller.
B00CHHCF0C|5|nice
B00JK63ATI|5|Nice
B00EFE9XQE|2|too small
B002KQ655G|5|I was looking for a coat thats would fix good and was faux fur on the inside i found this jacket and i have to say it was worth every penny it got here quick and fix great it is exactly as the seller info! if your looking for a great jacket you have found it
B00FVU4154|5|i took a chance and i love this hood. it is pretty warm and really cute. my kids say i look like an ewok and they are going to get me a brown furry snow suit so i look like a full grown bear but i dont care, i love it as an adult with a sense of humor. it does need a little bit more lining as the wind still gets in and makes me cold but it is warmer than other hats and scarves.
B00HJVCQZU|5|People will love you when you wear this shirt, it is a scientifically proven fact. Girls come up to me when I rock and say all flirty-like saying &#34;Wow, that shirt makes you look so much more sexy!  Where do you shop?  It must be like super expensive because I have never seen such an amazing shirt before, and I shop at Chanel!&#34;  Well, I paraphrased, but still they like it - and so do I!  The best part is this shirt qualifies as dress code in my high school (button down collar shirt).  It is soft too, I can't really describe the texture but your skin will thank you for it (especially when it's early morning and you are easily agitated by anything around you). Although I MUST WARN YOU, I had friends try it on and it just does not look as good on certain people. Most of the people who saw how it looked on them were not as excited about the shirt.  This may even be the cause for you.  Just keep that in mind; not all shirts look good on you.  The question &#34;How does this product fit?&#34; also refers to one's personality. If you are not usually one that is outgoing and is used to wearing simple designs like plaid or stripes or solid then this won't fit you.  If your face is usually pink because you blush, this is far from what you want (unless you are dressing up as a chameleon).  However, that should be common sense.  I still love this shirt and that is my overall point.
B0018P3GK2|5|I'm about 5'2\\" with an ample butt and small waist.  All my adult life, I've had trouble finding jeans that fit.  If they fit in the thigh/butt area, there's usually a huge gap in the back.  Belts aren't comfortable and there's too much fabric to cinch up.  If anything fits me, it will be Levi's, but the Curvy Jean is the absolute best!  There's no gap in the back.  There's plenty of room for my \\"fuller figure bottom,\\" and they don't taper too much around the knees.  These jeans do seem to be long.  I have to wear heeled boots or sandals with them.  Other than that, they're perfect!  Also, there's just enough stretch to make them comfortable.  I bought several pairs including some just in case I gain a little.  These are the best fitting jeans I've ever worn!
B006IC0GEE|5|These snowpants are perfect for a very active child.  They are well made and very warm.  They keep the snow out and the bib ensures that snow doesnt ride up under his coat.  We bought a pair of these for him last winter and are getting these to size up.
B00PQICCNY|5|I changed my mind on the color in the middle of my order and Dressystar changed it without a problem and delivered exactly when it was supposed to.  I was very impressed with them.<br /><br />Thank you!!!!!!!!!!
B00MO2QERU|4|I bought this as it was on Black Friday sale and wanted a robe somewhere between my terry cloth heavy one, and a lightweight silk one I have. I like the waffle pattern, and it definitely fits the bill for being a 'medium' weight option for me. I'm much larger than I should be and it fits fine. A skinny person may find it larger than they would like. I'm about 6' tall and 255 lbs and if I was a little larger it might end up being small for me.<br /><br />I've only used for a couple weeks so I can't speak for longevity, but I have no reason to believe it won't hold up under reasonable usage.
B001OCMA06|3|They were the quality I was expecting and not too short, but they bunch up whiIe running and become uncomfortable.
B008X8K0D8|4|This is a cute hair bow holder and the bows that came with it are a nice touch, there is only one issue one of the bows is also coming undone and I have not even used it as yet.
B004SX1464|5|This jacket is perfect! Great quality. Wearing with maxi dress today. Will work year round. Very pleased with this purchase.
B0013FLTIS|2|This is really a tunic, not so much a dress -there's no way it could be worn the way shown (unless the XS model is wearing an XL).  I'm a size 6 and ordered up based on reviews posted, but it was still too small.  Very flimsy fabric and quality overall - returned.
B009QDX144|2|very thin...flimsy...what was I expecting for the price???
B001AYE50Q|5|Great Product
B00UOENXWO|5|Fit well. I like the color and the way the side pockets snap, not button or velcro like other brands. Will probably order more.
B0042TZZFA|3|This is a quality made wig, but on the smaller side if you have a larger head.
B0025DCGDY|5|great product
B00HQARKJG|4|It fits a little big but it's super comfy and they're super pretty. I was scared it was oing to be too much push up but nope, it's just enough. I usually buy my bras from FOH or VS and these give those a run for their money. I already placed an order for my mom.
B005QR8PAE|5|I'm usually an 8-10 M, 36D, and the XL was snug in the bust. I'm afraid to dry it in the dryer. Very cute top, though.
B0058YEFK4|5|This was a gift for nephew.  Great quality, very cute sweater.  Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend to others.
B008UEB2M8|5|This is definitely my new favorite scrub top! I was worried xs would be too small, but it actually runs big. I get so many compliments on it when I wear it!
B003EH3V16|5|Bought this shirt in an XL and I'm about a size 16/18. It fits nicely and is a longer shirt and ends at the hips. I feel it's a great shirt and a great price :)
B004H4WI46|4|This review is mostly for the hat. The bodysuit is OK-  don't love it, don't hate it. But the hat is amazing- the only one to stay on our little one's head.
B00EPG9NOE|5|Good quality
B002LE74DE|5|I bought different sizes because the babies are growing super fast. It items i received fits perfect. Shipment was also perfect. I recommend these to all parents.
B00E1SQ5J2|5|This dress fits perfect, it came in great condition. the fabric was wonderful and it has a slip built it.
B00CME0PHK|5|Who doesn't love scooby doo. Fits a little big but kids grow so not complaining.  Color and design have held up perfectly through many washings.
B008KCJYKC|5|This jacket fits perfectly, and looks as I hoped it would when I purchased it. It's actually warmer than my winter jacket, so I might end up wearing it during the cold months as well as in the spring and autumn.
B001CBTUAW|5|They are exactly as shown. No disappointment. I love these and so do those that get to see me in them!
B00G874L22|5|Very cute and nice and thin to fit under even a tight boot. Love he detail and lace
B00D5WWTXQ|5|Good decent one for the price.
B00IMAFPE6|5|Free Palestine!
B000P55RDA|4|Just what I wanted. Lightweight.
B000E75K04|5|I got this in earth and it drapes very well.  I love it.  The material is very soft and comfortable.  Nice detailing and color.  Nice price too.  The same kind of top goes for $49 elsewhere.
B00M1MPEZ6|1|Wasn't at all what I expected to small
B007R9ON50|5|They fit perfect but still have to shorten them a bit. They look very good on & they are boot cut which is hard for me to find in this skinny jean world
B00RAYKCYI|4|It fits per ordered size
B00N27V30O|5|Nice belt, looks nice. Not designed to pull &#34;gut back in&#34; as it stretches.
B00SY41XX2|1|I ordered a 3X and it came as a 4X but is so small that it fit my daughter you usually wears a large.  It is very pretty and my daughter likes it but I won't be ordering from this company again.  If my daughter did not like it I would return it.
B00FVFEL72|5|Absolutely loved this shrug...it was the final touch for my 6yr old daddy/daughter dance. Made her feel like a princess and looked gorgeous with her sleeveless dress in February
B00FD2NGD8|5|Cool workout shirt. I'm about 6'2&#34; slim frame and a large fits nice. I wear this at the gym or lounging around the house. Deadpool is awesome!!
B00IE050Z8|4|The costume is soft and warm,  but does not come with the footed slippers as pictured. I was disappointed as I had expected it to come with whatever was in the photo,  but was disappointed to discover only the pajamas.  There is a back zipper across the butt so you don't have to take off the entire outfit to go to the bathroom,  which is a nice touch.
B00EJW22CE|5|It took one month for this to come.  It comes from China, so be patient.  The price is excellent, so buy multiples. The tie is polyester, not silk.  The colors are very vibrant.  I always get compliments!
B00817DZWO|4|I needed tee shirts for working around the farm.  They will be great for winter but the dark colors generate a lot of heat in the summer.
B008B9291K|4|i ordered them on Friday they got here on Tuesday and are perfect... color matches the picture the only thing is the finger tips look a little cheap but nice fabric and comfy to wear
B00JRIXR4C|5|love it
B005EZ0D6M|5|love this scarf! so soft!
B009JLWOHS|1|I was hoping to get a navy blue Henley in a large size as I've misplaced the Britches one I've had for years.<br />This one came quickly, but when I tried it on, it was way too tight in the body plus the sleeves were too long.<br />I did some measuring and the chest measures 38&#34; and the sleeves measure about 35&#34;.<br />Additionally it's not a heavy weight; I'd give it a medium weight at best, at best.<br />This not a Henley in the true sense, it's just thermal underwear in a Henley style.<br />So if you take medium size clothing, have extra long arms and need a little warmer clothing, have I got a deal for you.<br />Because I sure can't use it.  Maybe I got what they call an irregular, hmmm, I wonder since this won't fit anyone I know.
B00IVD7J6G|2|The bottom fit perfect, but the bra was way to small. I had to purchase another bra top separately in order to complete the suit. The bras should definitely be sized by the cup as opposed to S M L and XL
B000YQJD3U|5|I was hesitant about ordering this bra because I had never tried it on in person and because it is pricey.  That said, after about a month of use, I really, really like these bras. They are super comfortable (almost like a sports bra), but without the unfortunate uni-boob sports bra effect. I like that they have four hook size options in the back rather than the usual three. The back band and straps are wider than I am used to, but I actually like that now too. After reading other reviews, I was concerned that the padded inserts would show through clothing.  While they are quite obvious on the bra itself, I have had no problems with them showing through any type of shirt. I wish this bra was slightly lower cut as it can show when wearing a v-neck top. Additionally, the elastic on the side (that keeps the bra up when you are using the nursing option) takes a bit of getting used to- it seems a little too long for the bra itself.  Overall, though, This bra is a winner because it is very forgiving of changes in cup size and is extremely comfortable and supportive.
B005SYP6IY|5|I have never had a problem with Ajaxx63.  Very small Co.... I think 2 folks, and very friendly. (:o)
B00BWB64FG|4|I read others reviews before buying, and they were right- it does have a strange smell. However, it was gone after I washed it & it did not bleed onto the other clothes. It is a cute, comfortable robe and much less expensive than the others I looked at.
B0077DEGWG|4|I bought these thinking they were the same ones I got last year, but these were the cotton ones.  These fit a little tighter than the poly-cotton ones (I think they are HT), so I decided to return them.  I just sweat entirely too much for cotton when I run.  They'd probably be great for someone who doesn't sweat as much or who doesn't chafe as easily.  But I can't give them a horrible rating since I think they'd do what they're supposed to for someone who wanted cotton.
B00OWDAVCS|4|This romper is super cute but runs large. If you are typically a medium then I would suggest buying a small.
B0069KJFJM|5|excellent fit-so comfortable--looks great! from a septuagenarian who wears a size 10--wishing it were an 8. and no elastic waist--that's when I give up.
B00RA2YA9I|5|My kid loves it.  I'm lucky if I even get a chance to wash it, as she is always wearing it.
B004SWIZAS|4|This hoodie is a little tight in the shoulders, however I was able to stretch it out in that area when it was wet.  Overall, the material is soft and I like the colors.
B00L406ASG|1|This shirt  sucksss
B00HLT2LHS|4|Because my waist size is within the &#34;large&#34; range, I bought the large first but found that the elastic waistband was uncomfortably tight.  I bought another set in extra-large, and those pants are much more comfortable.  I find that I don't need to use the drawstring at all.  The inseam is a little short for me, and I wear a 30&#34; inseam.  However, I like the short inseam and just wear socks with these pants and am glad that the pants have no elastic in the cuffs.  The fabric of these pants is very smooth and comfortable.  I wear them when I am home and for short outside jaunts to pick up the paper or bring in the trash cans.
B0076R6L58|3|One of the sleeves was stretched out and the elastic band on one of the cuffs was broken. Otherwise, good quality and it was delivered on the expected date.
B00F02GKXY|5|QUALITY PURCHASE AND VERY FAST DELIVERY.... REASONABLY PRICED....<br />MY GRAND DAUGHTER LOVES THE COLOR... BABY PHAT IS A VERY GOOD LINE.  THANK YOU
B003FO0GJS|5|I ordered 3 of these scrub tops.  They are great, very comfortable and cute prints for a veterinarians office.  The company delivered them ahead of schedule.  Can't say enough good things about them.
B00KRS5AHS|2|The fit was to small and they do not put the return information in the bag.
B00JTR3JV2|5|Very nice
B000A0Y6BE|2|strangely found minimum support; probably should have sized down. But didn't feel right or supportive at all. strange gaping at the top. different style works for different people I guess. returning.
B001MU1K6K|5|I won for best costume
B005192ZYY|5|well these shorts i never thought would come my way but browsing i saw that they had that back stretch to it. Not too long nor short. perfect for a night out casual day. fit great those pockets are good except not deep enough to actually slip in something in there. overall the product is satisfactory :)
B00IJ8O0OW|5|I looked long and hard for something like this. I wanted a raincoat with some style but not overly glitzy for everyday wear during the rainy season but with no extra padding for winter because it's hot where I love, and this fits the bill. the fit is awesome in all the right places and it's comfortable.
B003WYF75O|4|I like the quality and they wash well without much shrinkage.  They run smaller than I like however they fit just fine.  Would buy again.
B00TC9QPXG|5|Good quality T Shirt! Exceeded my Expectations - Thanks!
B0027Z4IEK|5|Have loved Thorlos for over 20 years and they last forever. Very tick cushioned bottoms and they keep there shape. Love size selection they offer......fits 6-12 does not work for me - Bravo to Thorlos for sizes offered.
B006YEUH1I|5|great, excellent product.
B00GIIHO4S|5|This was gift for my sister and she LOVES it.  Colors are beautiful and fit was great.  Would highly suggest purchasing.
B00H4IUR04|4|I love these pants, however they do run  a little small. I wear a 4/6 and usually wear a small in yoga/workout pants in most brands, but the medium in these fit perfectly. I love the flat waistband-- it doesn't dig in or give me a muffin top. However, the waistband does roll down while sitting. The colors are not as vibrant as they stretch when you put the pants on, but the pants do not appear to be see-through. Overall, I love these pants for lounging around the house, and I can't wait to try them while doing yoga. I love the fact that they are made from recycled material and are made in the U.S. Teeki has some really cute prints, and I will definitely purchase other leggings by this brand in the future.
B00COQX30C|2|The fit is great in the tall size. It's warm enough and is made from what appears to be quality materials of a good weight. Only one problem and I bet you guessed it. After only perhaps a dozen wearings the zipper failed. Upon close examination the 'slider' or active part of the zipper is not made thick enough. In one day it went from the dreaded zipped area pulling open to complete failure. I am tall and thin so I don't think there was any undue stress placed on it.
B00J0I74NY|3|Seems to run a bit small round the hips.<br />The shipping was quick.
B00CQMGHNE|5|GREAT ITEM, WITH A REALLY GREAT QUALITY AND WELL-PRESERVED, WITH ALL THE FEATURES AND REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. GOOD PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING. A REALLY GREAT ARTICLE, NOT EASY TO FIND ONE LIKE THIS.
B00H89QY9W|5|very good，thank you very much
B00V3KHNHE|1|Product was a great fit for my teenage daughter but was advertised as a WOMEN's size.  Sizes were completely inaccurate for American buyers.
B000VYFZO6|4|Had this on my front door for over a year and it still works fine.  The knocker function is a little hard to trigger the sound, but no biggie.  Would be nice if it was a little more heavy duty and also had a nice knocking function.
B009476S2O|5|Great quality for price!  Size was hard to understand but the smalls (which I think I ordered on the site said &#34;Med&#34;) fit my toddler well, he is currently wearing a size 5 shoe.  They are little big so this is good as I wanted them to last for a little while. The patterns are great and the socks are soft!  I will definitely be buying more!
B006FULZ30|5|The make and size of these shirts are perfect. Have been collecting cubavera shirts for awhile to take on my cruise. So perfect for hot weather.
B00UM1UX9U|4|It arrived quickly. .. just as pictured a little small but clothes are like that... my daughter still loved it
B00E0EC0NM|5|Its okay
B00AECCYSA|5|They are good.
B009IO5TWS|5|all good, everything that was expected was delivered an excellent qualty product, nice appearance, great fit, I am buying another more
B00JS7O1B0|5|hermoso
B0019QFI4W|5|LOVE XENA!
B001CSIR6I|2|The costume was cute but started to fall apart after our daughter wore it to two Halloween parties. I had to sew multiple sections of it back together in order for her to wear it Halloween night.
B000SKP65Q|5|Was unsure about quality because the price was so good. I bought my son all new socks, purchased several packs. The socks arrived quickly, for the price the quality is excellent. Not quite as good as gold toe socks but darn close at a fraction of the price.
B00HN5C882|1|Still can't for them and I've lost 50 lbs and my son is 9 months.
B000O7NC7W|5|This dress belt was just what I was looking for: a classic belt with a classic buckle in smooth leather with no overt stitching; low-key, dignified, not too wide.  It was a smash hit, replacing a similar belt that had been worn to shreds over a lifetime of wear.  SUPER!
B00XKNB4U4|5|I wasn't sure what to expect, but I am very happy.  I am normally a Medium in US sizes, and I ordered the 2XL.  It fits, but I probably could have gotten away with the XL.  The quality is good.  It will be perfect for wearing to work over short sleeves or sleeveless tops and dresses.
B00AMPWSUS|5|Very nice. This looks great on my niece, the ballerina.
B00862DPV0|5|excellent pair of work trousers! I am a plumber who had been ripping holes in too many pairs of jeans at the knees. Doubled up, tough fabric has proved to be outstanding! Just know these are basically made for tin workers. whichbis why they have extra padding up front.
B008H1Z0JK|5|it is difficult to find a bra that supports you and is comfortable. This bra does both... I am going to order another soon<br />i was skeptical at first with the wires on the outside but it is by far the best bra i've ever owned<br />the only thing thats a lil different is where the underwire comes together in the middle it sticks out a lil...it doesn't show<br />on my clothes and it's not uncomfortable i may just have to get a larger size or something...
B00ITNINSG|5|Great shirts. Simple, fit well, look great, hold up well. I've bought two sets and am likely to buy more if I ruin these with oil, grime or some other muck.
B00E9AAHD2|4|light weight material, but grandson loves spiderman so I am sure it will be a big hit. I will let you know
B0076XGFSU|4|I bought this jacket to keep in my motorcycle saddle bags in case the temperature dropped or it rained.  I live in north Florida and it does get cold in the spring and fall.  In winter I wear a leather jacket.  Many times I've gone riding in the afternoon and by night time it is cold, too cold for just a sweat shirt.  It is the perfect in between jacket.  It seems well made  and has a heavy duty zipper.  I left a star off because I haven't owned it very long and can't say how durable it is, although as I said it looks well made.  It is insulated and will keep you very warm.
B00W571XS4|4|I was thrilled to find an inexpensive bra in my size. Loved the price too!  However, as stated, the back is only mesh; I was hoping it was a mixture of material to be sturdier.<br />I love the band underneath the cups- I think it helps the bra stay where it should. I am still mixed about the cup design- I like that it is sturdy, but the seam (running through the middle of the cup) shows thru almost everything!<br />It did fit as expected. The straps are snug enough to help support. I found the tag in the back very itchy.<br />I was looking for an everyday bra- some active times, everything from walking to shopping etc and this works well for me. I am not a runner, and haven't tried workouts in it yet.<br />I don't mind the colors under dark clothing, but wish they had more colors! Anything medium light colored, the contrast purple/white shows through. I did buy the purple and the black ones, as I only had to pay 1 shipping fee.<br />For the price, I probably would buy it again, although knowing about layering shirts (to keep seam from showing) and the down side of dark colors.
B00O91UQLO|5|My grandson loves this shirt!
B00JXDKC8A|5|Nice
B0067OSAVY|4|I just loved the way this panties fit. I mean they are so totally comfortable. They are a full panty, but they still make you comfortable and sexy. Totally getting a few more of these in other colors
B002HJ3DBA|3|Don't stay up. At all. I'm fairly skinny, but my legs are neither too tiny or too large. Why is it so difficult to buy normal, non-slipping knee socks? Unclear.
B009K0TTMG|5|There were a lot of reviews saying that the pants were too small, so I bought it a size bigger than what I usually wear. (I wear a size 0 or 2 normally, depending on what size stores sell.) I can say that the sizes are exactly what they say they are in the product description. I think people just gotta read and measure themselves with a measuring tape for their hip and waist sizes.The medium pants fit kinda loosely now, I should exchange my medium ones for a small, but medium is pretty nice too. That, and I'm too lazy to return it.<br /><br />If you're looking to buy this, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND measuring yourself before ordering.
B003824RPG|5|Make sure to refer to fruit of the looms sizing chart for these. The clothing that my 2.5 year old wears are all 24mths and some 2T. However we ordered this underwear in 4T and it fits somewhat snug.  He would have been very uncomfortable in size 2T.<br />  As for quality they seem very well made.
B007KH5ZR4|5|Super nice shirt! Got it for my nephews birthday and he loved it!
B007WA1YJW|4|Nice dress! !
B00N1U3Z3U|4|Great for the price...I bought three in different colors.
B008CX6UY2|5|My niece loved this for her birthday!  In great condition and really adorable.  Good idea for such a Dora fan.
B00QQV7WA8|4|Love it just need to find the right under garment and it will be perfect!
B000LRV2HC|5|I got this because I feed the squirrels at a park everyday. This is showing my love for them. If I can find more with squirrels on them, I will buy them too.
B005QL8LQ8|4|I felt the PJ Jeans had a look of denim and was the perfect length for me at 5'7\\".  My only disappointment is that the rise is a little too low for me.  They are quite comfy and as other reviewers have said, these jeans are hefty weight for fall.  I wouldn't wear these in the summer.<br />I wear a size 16, but ordered the XL due to my being very hippy (48') and the fit is perfect (initially was afraid they'd be too big, but glad I ordered UP a size)!  Anything that is cotton-rich, I tend to size up to allow for a little expected shrinkage.  I would order another pair if they came in black and had a higher rise.  I'd rather not give folks a \\"crack-attack\\" when I bend over-so I don't [knowingly] purchase low-rise pants!
B003JOMRZ0|4|I read the reviews that said to order a size  bigger than you normally are and I am glad I did. I am normally a medium and ordered a large and it just barely fits. It is a very cute skirt though.
B009SSLJA0|3|Gift for grandson.  Wasn't sure of his size, but he loved it anyway
B005KJD12U|5|bought this dress to wear to holiday parties this winter. Absolutely love it. bought in size 4, it's tts. I\\"m 5'6\\" and the dress hits right at the knee. Beautiful neckline. Love how it cinches at the waist. Black color is nice as you can dress it up more with colorful accessories or a brightly hued cardigan.
B00SYB9E7C|5|This is a great little dress! My 15 year old got so many compliments from teachers and peers. She looks amazing in it! It's a light, thin material, which is fine. Absolutely love this dress!
B00817EA82|5|Great
B005WUQXSG|4|I like the item and am ordering another I am going to choose another color very satisfied with quality and fit
B00KIK1D76|1|I bought a large (am normally a 6 or 8) and this was so small that it would only fit a pre teen girl!  I couldn't get my arms in it.
B00G9G3DDK|2|Good size just didnt really like the diamond design.
B00428ZHRC|1|I live in Florida and these do not stay in place for very long in hot and humid weather.  Almost must stay in an AC building for them to stay in place.  There was no paperwork included when these arrived.  They came in a small white package with no American writing on it.  They did not even come in a box like you would get at a store.  I had no idea how to even take care of them.  Will not use Amazon again for intimate apparel.
B008FXOMNU|5|I was VERY surprised when I received this dress. The thickness of the cotton weave is amazing. I am very tall and this dress fits perfect. I have very long arms, back and legs. I am going to put Pattyboutik in my wishlist for sure. All of their clothing looks likes it is made to fit me:) Thank you!!
B00R882JQU|5|Thank you so much for the size, I love baseball shirts and with my favorite band ❤ perfect fit and fast shipping, thanks ☺
B00IKVU1QE|5|The shipping was so fast, took 3 days to get here! It fit perfectly tight. I am 5'1, 113 lbs, and I got a small. It took about 5 min to get it on. Definitely tight and holds everything together. I just put it on right now and it is a bit uncomfortable at the moment. It pushes up against my chest, making it look like I have a slightly bigger chest area than normal :/ I'm folding it at the top. Other than that, it is exactly what I expected! Can't wait to see results! :)
B00VKTQOXW|4|Nice, but tight across back.
B005OK7HWK|5|I wanted a robe for post-hot tub use, and this is perfect. I'm a 5'6&#34; size 12 woman, and the Large comes down to my feet and is big enough to be cozy but not drown in. Also, the 100% cotton does the job when it comes to drying, doesn't make me feel like there's still water on my skin like some other softer blends do.
B003V4AKLG|5|This product is awesome! Looks and feels great. Workhorse type of quality.
B00CAUY1LC|4|Great jeans and i will buy more
B002TLUF7Q|5|Underwear fits well and they are comfortable. My ten year old son loves the feel and comfort! I will definitely purchase more
B001DCVEZY|5|My 6 month old granddaughter visited us in FL at Easter. She has an eye condition that makes her very sensitive to light.  The glasses were very dark and had plenty of coverage.  The strap is still a little big but she is very tiny. Along with a sun hat and a cabana she was able to spend time at the beach with us.  And...she looked adorable in them!
B00GJ9XO72|5|good quality
B008703XEK|3|It is a little tight in the shoulders and snug around the waist compared to my other suits.
B00NIVAEG8|4|I use the hat to do yard work. Quality made and well suited to my needs.
B0070N935I|1|Stitching is loose/loopy... going to fall apart promptly, I'm sure.
B008MQ1ZJO|5|Any The Walking Dead Head will love this cool T-Shirt with the various targets for slowing down or stopping a zombie. (Of course, if you're low on ammo you just want one perfect shot to the head!) I gave this as a Christmas gift to my 27-year-old son and he just loves adding this to his TWD wardrobe. Good quality fabric and this will definitely attract apocalypse preppers.
B002HL2GPW|4|The sweatshirt is okay. It's a little thinner then I would have preferred, and it seems to come in a size larger then you order and it doesn't shrink in the wash. Other then that, it is a really nice sweatshirt good for those days that are not overly cold.
B00D3EKEBK|5|This will definitely work for next winter too.  It's soft and warm.  Great quality, too.
B0007NID2M|4|This bra is comfortable and looks good. It does have a little padding. I prefer a more &#34;honest&#34; bra. Im a 36B and I want to look 36B. But still, it works and keeps everything in place.
B0081SF9IG|2|I thought I was getting a package of blue and green underwear. I ended up with Black and other colors. I am transferring pictures onto these undies for my son to incent potty training and now can't use half of the package.
B00DKSVPRG|1|I fit men's xl n this fit like a small medium my little sister who is in Jr medium large fit it the way I wanted it to fit me
B00B4TTCQE|4|Ping-Pong anyone?
B00ESWITRW|4|All of the reviews said that the clothes run smaller. So I bought a mens jacket, US/MED. Fits a little big but I don't mind that with my jackets. I'm sure it'll shrink when I wash it. The jacket is very nice, I'll definitely buy more from Doublju.
B00K7IOAT2|3|Doesn't cover as muc
B002WSZBZC|5|Love the shirt. I don't know anyone else that has a shirt like it. Some people just see the hot girl on it and I have to explain what it means but that is just part of the fun.
B013CSAX9O|5|This thing is dope. Holds just enough, doesn't feel bulky, and the key mechanism is surprisingly easy to use in any kind of lock. Plus I feel like a badass busting out a steel wallet.
B00080NYU0|5|I love it
B0027VT5XS|5|Very comfortable and Very fast
B003ELQ4W0|5|These are great! No pantilines and no elastic to bother with. They wash and keep their shape. No complaints! You won't even feel them on.
B00LYU8L6K|5|Nice Stylish shirt and great fit.  The color selection is also nice, I have several<br />of these &#34;George&#34; shirts and I have been very happy with them.
B00EK9243S|1|It was supposed to be XL but in reality it was a size M.
B000N89VNG|2|The watch was very pretty.  The battery lasted about 3 days, and then i spent $12 for a new one, almost 1/2 the purchase price of the watch.  I have small fingers and the band was a bit too big, so the watch didn't stay on tightly.  After a couple of weeks, i snagged it on a grocery sack and the band broke.  Would cost more to get the band fixed than to just buy a new one.
B0058FCPXC|5|This half mask is the perfect addition to a costume that involves wigs, hats or other likewise accessories. Inexpensive, and easy to wear...Everything that we freaks want in a face mask! U'll LOVE this!
B00JCB1AM0|5|My son loved the sweatshirt!
B00JPT235C|3|I like the suit but the torso is a bit short and narrow so if you have curves, I would not recommend this suit.
B00BYBZDBU|4|Work as expected.
B00DHJ58IU|3|Love the style of the jacket.  Purchased this combo for the jacket.  Like that it is largely cotton but, do not like the interior lining for the way it lays and it feels very inexpensive to the touch.  It would have been worth it to spend a little more and get a better liner.  Purchased this item in the plum purple and black and both colors are very rich in color intensity.  This peacock color is more medium but, to me seems more faded than vibrant.  The peacock is a turquoise - teal color.  I expected it to look good but, it looked ok. Maybe it is a yellow toned teal/turq.?  I'm a little perplexed by this color for this material type, usually velvet is very rich in color intensity.  I think maybe it would be ideal for a person with lighter colored features.  I like that the fabric is stretchy and the buttons are silver colored coats of arms with the same color as the fabric.  Pants would look better with bigger back pockets, in my opinion.  Depending on how much you like the color and style, I would pay between $150 - $175.  A higher quality interior lining would be a factor for me if the interior was nicer it would increase the value $50 easily to me.  Only wore style once but, jacket seemed to go up and stick when I got out of the car, so, I had to adjust it and I wonder how much this may occur?
B000ZHGBU6|4|Fit a little tighter than expected which caused a slight muffin top. Normally it wouldn't have been an issues but I purchased these for boudoir photos...
B00AQB2C36|4|Great suit, very comfortable, looks nice. Just a tad longer than I'd like.
B000EWG4VS|4|Good qualitg
B0008LU8FS|5|Durable, good fit.
B00BZC4AOY|4|I like the color and how I look in it.  It is very warm, and comfortable when I put it on.
B00K5ODDVY|3|My son is tall for his age and the pants will fit him for months to come but unfortunately I'm afraid after I wash the set he won't even fit in the shirt anymore!  It's almost like the top and bottom are different sizes:(. He loves Woody and Buzz so I won't be returning it but I wouldn't purchase this item again.  If I ordered a size larger, I can't imagine how big the pants will be.
B002R0FH0Y|2|Unfortunately this didn't end up fitting my daughter, so we had to re-order an adult size leotard for her. She's only 12 and she's an average size so I was kind of disappointed that it didn't fit.  She actually had to wait right before Halloween to get the second order that we made so we were kind of bummed.
B0097G79KC|5|Love this!  It was so thick and wide around my neck this winter and I did not need to carry gloves because when my hands were cold they went into the pockets and stayed warm!  Love it!
B001F0SRRC|5|I got this for my 17 year old brother as a x-mas gift. he thought it was cool. Personally, I thought it was a little heavy to be a belt buckle but he doesn't seem to mind. It's really nice and looks just like the picture.
B00M27Z6EE|1|Material was too flimsy, not wearable.
B004QDD2A2|5|Good buy perfect replacement fit. OEM it is the correct description and I had no  issues with it. Highly recommended.
B0071GZAOM|5|I really like these sleep pants. My biggest thing is the length. I have had other brands but the length was too short, I even tried going up a size. I am 6'1&#34; and 195lbs.,the inseam is long and the pants are very comfortable. I ordered a size L and they fit perfect. Couldn't be happier!!!
B000182AQ8|5|I just bought these shoes and I love them!  The leather is soft and the they are crafted very nicely!  They are perfect for work, a cocktail party, or even with dressy jeans.  I highly recommend them.
B00MN9BJXS|5|Adorable and good quality!  Will definitely buy more.
B00BMLR3N8|5|My grandson loves them, I bought them for him to wear to school so he only tried them on and is waiting for school to start.
B00F0PLMQ6|5|i love love this dress !!! i got some heels frm shi and got a pink purse . rocked it !!!!
B0092UZ93C|4|These Ariat boot socks are somewhat thin so if you are expecting think socks to wear with cowboy boots, these are not the ones. They are great looking and comfortable socks. I wear them most often with ankle boots. They are of the quality I always expect from any Ariat product.
B00B3LGB2Q|5|I absolutely love this! Fits great, goes with all work wear!
B007GBCOQY|5|Great fit!  Just what expected and wanted. Came in when supposed too.
B000A2BIRW|5|Hard to find these colors in stores, great value!
B005OPO13I|5|This shirt looks great with a cami, pair of jeans, and boots.  It is a very cute and comfortable top.
B00N8MYBFC|1|Horrific
B00JLBFMFW|5|Fit great.
B001VNBAWW|5|Suspenders were just as expected. Great quality for the price. Fast shipping. No complaints.
B00LTNOORW|5|I bought this for my husband as a surprise. He just loved it. I loved it too. Everyone complimented him on the shirt. I would recommend women to buy for their husband, partner, significant other, etc.
B00M243RW0|5|Hue socks are the only ones that I have worn for years, other than thick winter socks when needed.  Love the new designs!
B00ENLMP00|3|This is a rather large robe. I wish it came in more sizes. Also, the flannel is rather heavy. I was hoping for a thinner material than it is.
B0041230Y6|5|I am beyond pleased with my purchase of the Wild Child Zebra Rain Coat ! The coat is soft and comfortable for a child. Better than I expected ! I am also very happy with the service I get from Amazon.com !
B00ACKZ8IW|4|Runs a little small but color and graphic are accurately represented.
B0084N1JE6|5|It say I received a XS, but I actually got a S. After reading the reviews and hearing that they run a little small, I sent them a quick email to change it before they shipped them. I am glad they did, because the small fits GREAT! I am 5'6 and about 135 and I think the small is perfect. The color is bright and fun and I love it! The material is not bad either, I thought they were going to be rough but there actually not bad at all!
B00GBD3QS8|5|Nice quality
B0059TRNLQ|5|FIT AS EXPECTED
B006VDP5Y6|5|Thank You! Thank You!  My boyfriend is so Happy. I'm glad I found your product, he is so relieved. He has Wide feet and muscular legs. It's been difficult finding socks that he liked & felt good.
B00M7FQ3UW|3|REALLY DIDNT LIKE BECAUSE OF PRINT...
B00GFF78C2|5|nice
B000Y1FWB2|4|While it has a fairly high price, it's material is different and feels better than an ordinary fleece. The fabric is a little thinner than my other fleeces, but is still alright. It comes from Vancouver and shipped to New York quickly. The XL size fit a somewhat thin, little under 6' male fine. They asked for some specific sizes after the order, then shipped almost immediately after receiving them.
B00IDV6TWG|1|I was very disappointed with this purchase I typed in petite extra large and when I received work too long of a pants and the drawstrings broke on the first time that I put them on I am very disappointed with this purchase
B00DG7HDMC|4|The waistband and pockets are nice. The fabric is light weight enough that I can't wear them on cold days.  The pants were a little too long for me (maybe about 2 inches) and flare quite a lot at the bottom.  For such light weight pants, these are a little bit expensive.  Otherwise, they are well made and comfortable.
B00E9UUHIM|1|These are small and the material is thin
B009YZS71Q|1|I ordered these to go with an outfit I was wearing to an eighties party.  They arrived a day before the party and when I tried them on the were too small.  It was too late for me to return them and get something else. A huge disappointment.
B00BYIHLL8|3|This visor is a nice one. I rated it only three stars because it was advertised as aqua in color, but definitely is not aqua, It definitely does not look like the color in the ad. I really, really wanted aqua, but it is too late to return it now. I will wear it, but I don't know that I would order another one, hoping to get aqua, but instead getting what is more like a royal blue.
B00011FTMW|4|I agree that this is a nice handbag, but it's a little big. However, since that seems to be the style these days, it's okay. Plus, you can't beat the price. I would've liked a divider or something on the inside... just because it is so big and everything I have in there now is kinda mushed together. I do like the pink lining and the black bag is very striking. The buttons are a little hard to do if the bag isn't completely full- you've got to maneuver them around a bit before they snap.
B0044UF2JG|5|The style and construction seems to be almost unchanged from the ones I remember back in the 80s.  The only differences I see (and it might just be my bad memory) is that there is a denim loop on the inside of the collar at the back of the neck and the Levi's logo is silk screened in red on the left inside pocket.    The main concern is the sizing chart.  I'm 6'0\\" and 145lbs with a 32\\" waist.  I ordered a Large so it would be a bit loose, but it fits almost like a tailored jacket and I haven't even washed it yet.  If it shrinks in the wash, it will be pretty snug in the waist when buttoned.  For a normally proportioned 6' guy, a large would be too small.  I'd strongly recommend going a size above the sizing chart for a regular fit and two sizes above for a loose fit.  One nice thing about the sizing is the sleeve length.  With my arms fully outstretched, I can still pull the cuffs up almost to the middle of my palm.    Ordered through Amazon and shipping was very fast, no complaints at all in that department.
B00VFKG8GY|5|I bought this tunic for my girl friend and she loves it. I show so many same tunics but i didn't like the way the sleeve looks. This one has cap sleeve like no others, so I bought this one and it was right choise. I'm going to buy other colors as well.
B00MYVG598|5|The dress is perfect! I was so impressed with how thorough Angel Bridal was when I was sending the measurements for the dress. They wouldn't get started until the measurements seemed right. They even sent me a link to show how to do correct measurements. Working with them was amazing; and the dress fit perfect! I mean perfect! It was also more beautiful in person than online. Thank your for a wonderful experience.
B0001YRWQK|5|I am a big guy that constantly use tools, answer my cell phone and so on. You got enough pockets to hold screws and parts while working on electronics. Once you wash them the fabric turns out for the better. I already got 5 pairs and my wife puts them on the washer and hang them dry. Resistant material and comfortable to wear.
B001FOR0VC|4|It was OK for me. It's a good product.<br />I hope to find a good offer for my next buy.<br />Regards,
B0064D2LZ4|5|These are a little small but they are beautiful and  stretch to fit after worn a few times.
B0032AMTNG|5|Ever since I got this belt, it has been my favorite! It's so versatile, I use it with my black dresses, tunics, long tops, jeans, and shorts. It's of good quality and also seems to be very sturdy judging by the way It's holding up to my abuse ü I highly recommend it!
B009P82S6M|5|This is such a cute shirt. The design is simple yet fun. It is the perfect shirt to just throw on with some jeans or shorts. Plus the material is so soft.
B00ACIGNJW|5|very good
B00JY8525M|4|Great shirt. Came fast and as expected. Fits great
B0057XBD5Q|5|Will see how it does after a few more washings, but so far it is holding up well. Just what I was looking for, a good quality, low cost work shirt. This may be the successor to JCPennys discontinued Big Mac Workwear line. (Any conspiracy theories on who might have complained about the name?)
B003MWGKAC|4|These were for my husband who has diabetes. The tops of the socks were loose and non-binding but the body of the socks were a bit too thick for him. He's used to wearing old cotton socks that are very thin. I was satisfied with them but I don't have to wear them!
B00QXNJP7M|2|I bought men's socks thinking they would fit, but they still don't fit my calves very well and the stripes are diagonal and crooked looking.
B00EB13L1Y|5|These are the best jeggings  I have ever owned! I was so nervous to order them because, like all other women, jean  shopping is the worst form of torture imaginable. I took my hip measurements, used the size chart, but still fullyexpected them to arrive and be way too small or uuncomfortable. I am obsessed with how soft and comfortable these are. When you buy jeggings you run the risk of them looking like denim printed leggings. However I was presently surprised that these are actual denim. They feel just like leggings when worn but they look identical to denim even from close up. I am ordering them in more colors and will probably exclusively buy this brand of jeans online from now on. I never leave such positive reviews, haha!
B00EYT1KY8|4|Soft fabric, great color I purchased these in blue.  The pants tie so will fit anyone any size.  Better than pajama bottoms.  I will definitely shop with this vendor again.  Fast shipping, excellent customer service
B001GCUD5I|4|Received my package on time and in good condition.  The pants were exactly like they said.
B00GYZLZPE|5|Fit well as added Layer
B00HAJUQM6|5|Love the jacket great color
B006L3V608|5|These socks are compact, useful and well-made, I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend to friends! H j
B00BRDCRH8|5|BOMB AZZZZZZZZZ COLORS
B0073ODGJ8|4|I like this cap.  I am partial to non-baseball type caps and this one seems to fill the bill quite nicely.  It appears to be of decent quality and of good value for the price.  The real approval rating is that my wife said \\"nice cap\\" and she usually hates my caps.
B004ZBNW3W|3|These are very soft, well-made, and fit the bill of a bootie that actually STAYS ON--something that any new parent knows is a real challenge!  But $40 is ridiculous.  For that much money I would expect hand-knit cashmere booties that put themselves on and do my taxes.  If these had not been a gift I would NEVER have gotten them.
B008G3L52K|5|The shirt made it to my house on time.  The shirt was the size and shape I was expecting.  Good looking shirt.
B00ITIULNG|5|I love the material and it fit me just right , knee length how i wanted it , im 5.1' height.
B00THQGP1Q|5|I absolutely love this top. Its very flattering if you look like the mannequin shown. I am 5'5&#34;, 120 pounds and i bought size medium. Perfect. It falls nicely and hugs the hips. Material is soft and glossy looking. A little stretch like lycra is added to the cotton. Can be dressed up or down. I got the royal blue but will purchase other colors. I wanted more variety in the style at the top. Love the hip hugging action but the top area could use a little something.<br />Highly recommend.
B000FZZ6FO|3|A bit small.
B00FVXDF9O|5|Shirt arrived about 15 days earlier than expected. I like the fit and the matieral.
B00LCS06AS|1|Terrible, terrible, terrible.<br /><br />The fabric is so coarse and uncomfortable I cannot wear them for more than a few hours or my leg hairs start to hurt.
B00741CAWO|5|Well made and quality buckle. I own three different colors. Enough said
B00GHA6QAU|5|Ordered jeans for the first time on the internet…. they fit perfect which is a surprise because in store I couldn't find any!! I have big hips and a big butt so I am extremely happy!!
B00H2TDIMO|5|One might say it's.... amazing!
B00QYEAXOY|1|tooo smaalll,
B00BYSSZDG|1|For those looking for a fabric, non-stretch' belt, this is a rare find. The problem is, I've had to send back BOTH my separate orders!<br /><br />With a 36\\" waist, I ordered a large.  The first one measured 55 inches!.  Amazon was very nice- sent the return label, and expedited a replacement (FedEx Sat delivery).<br /><br />The second one was 48 inches.<br /><br />I'd be thrilled to bump this up to 4 or 5 stars, if I could get one that fit!.  I sent an email directly to Nautica.  Awaiting response.
B007SVFIF6|5|Just rec'd my new Skechers frames, which were a replacement for the originals. Exact same item and it was a snap to transfer lenses from old Skecher frames to this new frame. Highly recommend these frames if you're looking for a replacement.
B00E2WFGE2|3|My daughter is on the smaller side and this hat is pretty tight on her.  The chin strap goes across her mouth.  I'm planning to return this.
B00BQFPRYM|4|EDIT, re washing:  the blouse shrinks when dried fully on low, and it is very wrinkled.  So will have to be ironed.  Suggest you don't dry it fully, and when you dry it, do it in a full load of other cotton stuff, and DO use low heat, but only long enough so that the blouse isn't wet.  Then hang to dry.<br /><br />Original review, follows below.<br />===================<br /><br />Think hot Africa summer safari shirt, but fabric is thin (not like twill).  Original price was $34.50, per the tag.  So this is a closeout. For less than $9, it won't have to live long, huh!<br /><br />The black lining you see in the photo is the button placket, and it is also linen;  that black placket goes all the way down the front of the shirt, on the inside.  Same black 'placket' lines the inner hem of each arm.  These give the blouse a nice body and drape.<br /><br />It is true that the buttonholes aren't completely finished, which matters due to the black placket.  So you'll want to finish them off while watching TV, etc.<br /><br />Belt is as shown in the picture.  Color is more tannish than the picture can show, but the picture's lightness is almost spot on.<br /><br />Order your true size, unless you plan to wear the shirt open.  It's 55% linen, so always wash cold, remove promptly after drying on low heat, and know it will wrinkle or rumple soon after you put it on.  If you dry it on medium heat, it will shrink.  So even if you dry it on low heat, remove it while it is still damp.
B00YC5UYIC|3|There is no padding in the top of this suit. Very thin fabric, especially for a large bust.
B0009GCUU8|5|I am a woman about 5'5&#34; and 125 pounds; I ordered the small & it fit perfectly. Quality of the shirt seems good, it did not shrink after washing & drying.
B00DYRHNU6|5|hermoso me encanto
B0012IZHS4|3|These are overall good, however the fabric is a little too thin and they run very, very small. Get the Carter's ones if you have the chance.
B00D2CMHYA|5|I am very pleased with this product.  Although I learned that the credit cards cannot be doubled with two, front-to-back or it will not close.  I put all credit cards and frequent shopping cards in and i still had to pull a bit to get it to snap.  Now it has stretched a bit and is great!
B004RL33N4|5|Excellent, to perfection, fit very well, very comfortable, at least to me neither long nor short these are great, I recommend it to my eyes closed and most important, no problems with the measures.
B008CJFDKI|5|we love it!  Good quality.
B008BNN95G|2|The shirt came faster than expected. But, it did not fit. It WOULD have fit if it were really a men's medium like the description mentioned. The shirt I ordered was a men's YOUTH medium, which was not specified in the listing and made all the diffrence. The shirt did not fit at all and I'm in the process of returning it. Very disappointed.
B00JXZ5AB2|5|I recommend , is  Cute well made  I had no problems with the sizing.
B00DSYC2UQ|3|This pullover looked sharp out of the package and I loved the colors, but I ended up returning as the fit didn't seem right.  I am between a medium and a large, so ordered the large, but that seemed snug - especially in the shoulders.  An XL would have been too baggy in spots,  I much prefer the 3 or 4 Quiksilver pullovers which fit great (size Large) and seemed better made.
B00565V1AC|1|The stitching on the smocking is falling apart.  Just took it out of the bag.  No way this is a size 8 girls.  Can't return it now past return window.  Gonna see if it can be fixed.
B00BG6834M|3|The small is not for regular size 0 pants wearers. It states for size 4-6, if you are not at least size 4 in pants, the shorts are big. The pink is pretty. I wished there were hidden pockets and the sides didn't stick out like a pouch.
B002LSI2YK|4|The pants are nice pants, though my main concern is how well they will hold up at work. If they can at least last 6 months, that would be awesome and I will let you know when I finally have to toss them out.<br /><br />There is an annoying tag that I dislike, and the leg pocket is for style and doesn't actually function, so that's a bit of a disappointment. The actual front pockets are a nice depth, and the rear ones are okay. I like that the pants fit high, and knew that when purchasing. I do feel they are a bit lose, which may increase their life expectancy, but at the same time fear going down a size would have made them too tight.<br /><br />The pants do attract a lot of hair and lint, but that's to be expected of black pants. So far the wash hasn't seemed to dull their color, but once again, we'll see how that holds up. Obviously, I wish the price was a bit cheaper, but they are decent.
B00YGY0I9E|5|Looks very nice, I haven't wore it yet
B000VDYMNM|4|Very cute shirt we used it with a costume but it is very thin but you can't beat the price !
