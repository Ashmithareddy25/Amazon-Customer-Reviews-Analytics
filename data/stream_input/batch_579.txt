B000A88EV4|5.0|I didn't really look forward to seeing this movie, as David Thewles is not a favorite, but he is mesmerizing here; he just gets into your mind and gut.  This movie will stick.  One reviewer in the Chicago Trib said that his portrait of homeless Johnny is equal to Shakespeare's Richard III as king.  It was a tour-de-force; a man so strung out, on the edge, and largely because his considerable intellect couldn't compromise the world he inhabited.  It was too horrific and he couldn't make it work.  Perhaps he reads too much.  He is paralized intellectually, hence emotionally.  Leigh at the end shows us what he should do, what is important in all the muck.  SPOILER -  The love of a good woman, but Johnny is simply unable to connect.  The last shot of him hobbling down the middle of the street, in pain, but with no other way open for him, is truly compelling.  end of SPOILER - This is not an easy movie; like \\"Riff-Raff\\" of the year before, it shows an English middle lower class in utter disarray.  I first saw this film when it came out, and I can still close my eyes and see that last scene.  I always felt that Thewles was robbed of an Oscar.
B000BGH22W|2.0|Patrick Doyle is a very good composer. His score for Kenneth Branagh's 1989 adaptation of Henry V is one of my favorite soundtracks. A film like that, however, should be used as Exhibit A to show why he's the wrong person to score a Harry Potter movie. It's not that his music for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is necessarily bad, it's just not up to snuff. Granted, it's very hard to reach a bar that's been set by John Williams, but the first three movies give a pretty good blueprint of not only what the score should sound like, but at the very least the types of musical cues used for different types of scenes. Instead, Doyle throws all of Williams work in the first three films out the window (except for a smattering of \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" lasting approximately ten seconds), creating a score that is, while pleasant enough in parts, totally inappropriate for the subject matter. The best example is track 16 titled \\"Hogwarts March,\\" music he's composed  sounding inexplicably like music written for an Oktoberfest celebration.    This soundtrack was Patrick Doyle's big chance to come out from the shadows of being \\"only\\" an independent film music composer and join the big boys like Williams, Danny Elfman and James Newton Howard. Instead, he falls flat on his face by trying to move forward while completely ignoring the past.
0895260131|1.0|See how this one verse from Quran proves author's entire thesis as false and as embarrassingly deceptive:  <br /> <br />There is no compulsion in religion. The right direction is henceforth distinct from error. And he who rejecteth false deities and believeth in Allah hath grasped a firm handhold which will never break. Allah is Hearer, Knower <br />[Qur'an 2:256] <br /> <br />If you have any sense of integrity or fairness please read Mohammad's bio any where or here  <br />[...]  or  [...] <br /> <br />wow. <br />why would you get your heart checked by a foot doctor. <br />why would you get info about Islam from Robert Spencer. <br />Blows ones mind away. <br /> <br />Islam is a universal religion to unite people of the world regardless of their beliefs, color, ethnicity, wealth or health. <br />Slavery and bigotry is banned in Islam. All are created equal in Islam. unlike our recent history in U.S, blacks, whites, browns, etc etc, have the same value in eyes of God. and yes Allah means God. God of all monotheist. God of Abraham, God of Moses and God of Jesus. <br /> <br />no mention in this book that Islam was spread throughout Europe and Asia and Africa because people accepted it, and not by sword as the author would like you to believe. There are tens and thousands of people across the world, including U.S accepting and embracing Islam. who is putting the sword to their necks? <br /> <br /> <br />Violence is not at the core of Islam as playing with children's lives is not at the core of Christianity. <br /> <br />Don't Judge an entire religion that has contributed to overall betterment of humanity because of the actions of some wackos and <br />the current events. <br /> <br />Why so afraid to take an unbiased look at Islam? <br />I am a convert, and part of my decision had to do with <br />how truly Universal Islam is. For instance, there is no <br />concept of White, Black, Latino, Asian, Arab, etc etc in Islam. <br />For example, while Jesus was an Arab Jew,the western societies would like to make him out to be a white person with blond hair and blue eyes, tee hee how funny.  <br /> <br />Despite what you see on the news Islam truly honors and accepts Chritianity (mainly based on old testament and Ten Commandments) and Judaism.  <br /> <br />It must be said though that some so called Islamic societies must come in terms with the world and reality. But please don't blame their behaviour so conveniently on Islam. <br /> <br />Why hasn't the author referred to these sayings in Quran: <br /> <br />\\"Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors. (The Noble Quran, 2:190)\\" <br /> <br />\\"But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou (also) incline towards peace, and trust in God: for He is One that heareth and knoweth (all things). (The Noble Quran, 8:61)\\" <br /> <br />\\"God does not forbid you from showing kindness and dealing justly with those who have not fought you about religion and have not driven you out of your homes. God loves just dealers. (The Noble Quran, 60:8)\\" <br /> <br />\\"Say: 'Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger: but if ye turn away, he is only responsible for the duty placed on him and ye for that placed on you. If ye obey him, ye shall be on right guidance. The Messenger's duty is only to preach the clear (Message). <br />(The Noble Quran, 24:54)\\" <br /> <br />Also, let's look at the verses that shows the miracles/sciences of Quran: <br /> <br />And it is We Who have constructed the heaven with might, and verily, it is We Who are steadily expanding it. (Qur'an, 51:47) <br />Discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929 <br /> <br />Then He turned to heaven when it was smoke. In two days He determined them as seven heavens and revealed, in every heaven, its own mandate. (Qur'an, 41:11-12) 1.Troposphere 2.Stratosphere 3.Mesosphere 4.Thermosphere 5.Exosphere 6.Ionosphere 7.Magnetosphere <br /> <br />\\"HE makes you, In the wombs of your mothers, In stages, oneafter another, In three veils of darkeness [39:6] <br /> <br />These three veils of darkness in the QUR'AN refer to: <br />(1) interior abdominal wall of the mother <br />(2)the uterine wall (3)the amnio-chorionoic membrane. <br /> <br />Quran is highly vast, pluralistic and mystical and its understanding requires the reader to have those qualities as well. <br /> <br />For instance, as it has been mentioned in several previous reviews and in encyclopedia, the term \\"non believers\\" or \\"infidels\\" does NOT refer to Christianity or Judaism. Christians and Jews are held in High regards in Quran as \\"guided\\" and \\"people of the book\\". \\"infidels\\" in Quran refers to the Arabic word Kafir. Kafir literally means to cover/hide something. Furthermore, to fully understand Quran you must read the entire Holy Book, not just one chapter or one verse and then you will understand its context and time. <br /> <br />See here how the modern technologies wouldn't have been possible without inventions by Islamic Scholars: <br /> <br />cyberistan.org/islamic/index.htm#biosc <br />miraclesofthequran dot com
1932907009|5.0|Cat is an amazing guide to screenwriting, explaining the formula while showing how not to be too formulaic.  I have been interested in screenwriting for some time but never knew where to start (or where to end, for that matter), but Cat has gotten me through the planning and writing of my script.  I recommend this book to anyone who has ever been interested in writing for films! It's totally awesome!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|An absolute amazing CD.  Sounds a lot like Fall Out Boy but a bit more up tempo.  This band from Vegas really gets you in a great mood.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes pop punk/ emo music.  Great CD.  Not a single song that I skip over on the entire CD.  The only gripe is that the CD is kind of short.

B000301YY8|3.0|I own this James Blunt cd titled \\"Back to Bedlam.\\" I really love this cd. The order of the tracks has a great flow. The cover of the cd is not as creative as it could have been, but then again it is only the cover (never jugde a cd by it's cover, lol). Most of the songs are for people who are in love with someone or something. I am fine with this because I have a very wonderful boyfriend whom I love with all of my heart, and I hold him very close to it as well. But I can speak for my good friend Sarah who does not have a boyfriend and does not like anyone at this point in time. Most of the songs make her very depressed and she can only tolerate the Cd for a couple of tracks. I think that James Blunt has a great voice, but I have talked to several people that find it most of an annoyance. I also think that he is cute, but he is just not my type. What can I saw? I love big strong men who I feel like they can protect me and my family. Well that basically sums up my ICY!!!! All of the songs have a good beat but not all of them are unique. Overall, an ok cd. Some parts are good, some are just above satisfactory. <br /> <br />It IS worth it's price.

He is best suited to the stage.His albums have been corny for nearly 20 years straight to me&How He keeps getting deals is beyond me.re-cycle grooves&under-written songs with genric production is tired.
B00005ATQC|4.0|Tom Cruise and Nicloe Kidman star in Stanley Kubrick's final film about sexual desire and suspense.  Cruise plays Dr. William Harford, a successful New York doctor.  Kidman plays his wife Alice, an aspiring art dealer.  They seem to have a very good marriage, but do they?  Bill and Alice are invited to a party at one of Bill's colleague's homes.  Soon, Alice is dancing with a strange man, while Bill is with two models.  All seems well after the party until the two begin smoking marijuana, and then the accusations begin to fly.   <br /> <br />Alice admits to having secret fantasies about having sex with a man she and Bill encountered on a vacation. She also chastises Bill for not admitting to his own fantasies.  Enraged at his wife's admission, Bill becomes obsessed with having an affair of his own to even the score with Alice. Soon, he's visiting the daughter of a dead patient and a hooker (who finds out later that she's HIV positive).  However, these tend to be rather harmless encounters as nothing becomes of either of them.  But wait, Bill's quest for satisfaction is just beginning. <br /> <br />Bill runs into Nick Nightengale (Todd Field), a former friend from med school who now plays piano in a seedy jazz bar.  Nick tells Bill about a secret sex group that he knows about from playing piano at the house where they meet.  Intrigued, Bill manages to get the secret password from Nick he needs to get into <br />the house.  Once inside, Bill discovers a world of sex and very strange goings-on.  Unknown to him, the people at the house were aware of his intentions to get inside.  After being \\"found out\\", Bill realizes that he and his family are in potentially grave danger.  Will Bill and his family be allright, or will Bill's escapade turn out to be more than he bargained for? <br /> <br />I thought this was a very good film.  The plot is full of twists and it will keep the viewer on their toes.  Cruise and Kidman give very good performances, and their on-screen chemistry is no surprise, because the two were married in real life when this movie was made.  I've been a big Kubrick fan for a long time, and I've enjoyed other films of his, such as \\"Full Metal Jacket\\".  I would rate \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" second only to \\"Full Metal Jacket\\".  This movie is loaded with action and twists, and the viewer will surely enjoy the non-stop action.  Seeing Nicole Kidman in the nude was an added bonus. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film. Stanley Kubrick died shortly before this movie was finished, but his fine work is evident throughout the movie.  Kubrick fans will soon discover that this movie carries on in the fine tradition of earlier Kubrick films.  Watch and see Tom Cruise and Nicloe Kidman together in a very entertaining film.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|This movie really is as huge as the hype has made it out to be.  First it's really the first gay love story (if you want to call it a love story) to go mainstream, second it's got two pulitzer prize winners and Ang Lee involved, third it's got the best acting I have ever seen on film, and when you mix everything together you get the most professional adaptation of a written work I wouldn't want to say ever done, but it certainly might be.<br /><br />You probably know the story by now, so I won't go on with plot summeries, but I will tell you what made me attend this film 4 times at the theater:<br /><br />As an English major this movie was like literary heaven.  After the first time I watched it I was blown away by all the foreshadow, symbolism, parallels, and poetric transitions that this film did perfectly.  For instance, Jack always misses what he \\"shoots\\" (coyote, deer) but Ennis hits them.  In a sense Ennis has \\"hit\\" Jack, but Jack can never really \\"hit\\" Ennis.<br /><br />At the end of one scene Alma throws down mail and the camera captures an ad for Honey.  In the next seen Jack says \\"Honey\\" to his wife.  What a great Poetic transition!<br /><br />There are many parallels, most notably that embrace from behind.  Jack and Ennis do it twice, once while in the motel and another during the flashback when Jack is \\"sleeping like a horse.\\"  Alma also embraces Ennis from behind in the first bedroom scene when she wants to move into town.  Even the their two shirts together in the end can be considered an embrace from behind.<br /><br />Jack foreshadows his outcome by wearing purple in one scene.<br /><br />I could go on and on and on with all the fun English and Literary goodies I found by watching the movie--trust me, I took pen and paper into the theater and filled up 5 front-and-back pages of notes.  But I think I can summerize how I feel about this film by simply saying it is outstanding, and will always be considered Best Picture no matter what the Oscars have to say.cars have to say.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|I really loved this movie, but Jack Black is an awful actor.  It will always be a mystery to me as to why they chose him for that part.  This movie could've been great had they cast an actor with talent to play that role.
B000C3H4MC|5.0|This has always been my favorite TALKING HEADS album, along with one of my favorite albums of all time. At the time this came out, I remember that most of us \\"punk-newwavers\\" were pretty amazed by their previous album FEAR OF MUSIC, and all the innovation and texture that was on that album. (Lyrics in Swahili, dense percussion, outrageous conceptual songs, etc.) It seemed that Eno and the Heads could go no further. But before REMAIN IN LIGHT was created, Eno and David Byrned did that MY LIFE IN THE BUSH OF GHOSTS album, where they investigated african rythyms, dense overlayed lyrics, and many other innovations that perhaps we take for granted now. Anyway, REMAIN IN LIGHT had the critics mouths hanging open. I remember in ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE, the review said that this album was so far ahead of its time, that the rest of the bands would take years to catch up. It was an accurate observation. In fact, this was as \\"arty\\" as the Heads ever got. Even tho the entire band is credited on each track, so is ENO. Apparently, the other Heads besides David Byrne, the head HEAD, felt that they were no longer a band for the people, or had become too esoteric, whatver. After this album, they moved back into a more direct, commercial sound with their next album, and Eno was not involved. So, that leaves us with this masterpiece of the NEW WAVE movement, and one of those great treasures that unfortunately, many people who didnt come up at that time, know not much about. After all, except for that cool cover that LIVING COLOR did from this album, not many bands followed this direction, except for the electronic bands. Maybe they felt it was too much like \\"ART ROCK\\". (except this is music, that hardly has more than one chord, or two, on any song.) The sad fact is, that this kind of music takes a lot of developement, and intellect, and education (they were all ex-art school students), and that is a path not taken by today's pop-punk bands, or computer generated mash ups, remixes, etc. If just as inspiration as to what is possible, this would be a fantastic album to study.<br /><br />What is offered on this DUAL DISC is simply amazing. The Heads know that this is their best album, and they didnt want to disappoint. When they went to expand their mixes to 5.1, this was the first album they remixed. The reasoning is clear. So many layers and layers of sound lay buried in the old stereo mix, that hearing it for the first time in that 5.1 mix, is a revelation. The back speakers play the percussion parts, or sometimes four of the speakers will swirl the synth and guitar parts around your head, as in THE OVERLOAD. Even on the cheapest DVD home theater system, the sound and expanded clarity is astonding. Instruments are pulled out of the mix, that were only at best hinted at, when the old vinyl was spinning on the stereos. Plus, the regular stereo remastering has been greatly improved upon.<br /><br />There are plenty of extras with this release, including four new studio outtakes, three of which have vocals. I dont mean to say lyrics. I suppose that an album with this much call and response, and triple layered vocal parts, etc, needed a lot of experimentation and trials, in order to find what it was that ENO and the Band were after. Now, these new songs are great to hear, and they are not demos, or early versions of other songs. They DO stand on their own, at least to me. (At the very least, they are as good as the \\"SONG\\" numbers from CATHERINE WHEEL, which the Talking Heads had incorperated into their live act.) The four new songs, help to deconstruct this recording and writing process. As far as I'm concerned, anything that helps to explain how this album came about, I want to hear.<br /><br />Other extras include two  live versions of the songs done on German TV, a booklet with the storyboard for the video of HOUSES IN MOTION. (One of the very first MTV videos that caught massive rotation, and helped to popularize this album.) ALso, there are David's hand written lyric drafts to two songs, one from the album and another that was not used, but perhaps were written for one of the unfinished instrumental with vocalizations. Again, fascinatning to study. IT shows how the lyrical ideas, of having three simultaneous vocal parts, came to be. Adrian Belew even puts a little quote in there, just in case you wanted to know the social impact this album had. It truely was the Sgt Pepper of the  NEW WAVE generation. AND, if that were not enough, there are photos on the DVD side of the CD, so when you listen to the 5.1 mix, you can look at pictures as well.<br /><br />I do want to address the negative remarks made about this edition. First, sure, some CD or DVD players cant play it. For those of you who don't hesitate to buy a new cell phone, so it can take photos, videos, surf the internet, text message, play MP3s, and cook dinner, I can't understand why you would NOT update your DVD player, if you have had it for 15 years, or your CD player. I would guess, that you would have to own an ancient DVD player, for this to be a problem. Also, what is the problem with the gatefold cover, instead of inserts in a CD plastic case? If you dont want the cover scratched up, buy those CD plastic slip covers. Problem solved, for 10 cents. (The real reason the industry is turning to this presentation of CDs, is to prevent cheap reproductions.) As for handling the CD/DVD, it takes no more care, than any CD. If you are hard on CDs, then copy the CD onto a CD-R, and carry that around with you. If it were on 2 CDs instead of just the one, people would have complained about the price. As for no lyrics, well, I'd rather have the reproductions of the original lyrical ideas. I think if you were to go to TALKING HEAD web sites, you could find lyrics. Personally, I think I have most of them memorized--they are not that hard to hear. So, should you update your old CD? I'm not sure about the other DUALDISC TALKING HEAD releases, but this one is well worth the money.David's hand written lyric drafts to two songs, one from the album and another that was not used, but perhaps were written for one of the unfinished instrumental with vocalizations.

076113719X|5.0|While this type of calendar may take a little getting used to--it runs vertically rather than horizontally--I have found that it makes it much easier to keep my family organized.  There are five members of my family so each person has a column on the calendar and on those days where everyone has at least something going on, it makes it much easier to neatly record the information instead of trying to fit it in the little squares you get on a regular calendar.  I also use my calendar to record information, much like one would in a babybook, and then I save the calendar at the end of each year.  This type of calendar certainly makes it easier when I want to look up any information about one of my children.  I just simply look under their name until I find what I am looking for.  Truly a must have for busy families that want to stay organized.

B00005JOE8|5.0|I knew I would love this movie the moment we first see V and he begins spouting lines in alliteration.  That cue right there let me know this wasn't going to be the average action film.  Of course, with all of the hoopla and news about this movie and its controversy, I never once truly thought it would be the average action film.   <br /> <br />In fact, to call it an action film is misleading.  It has more in line with political thrillers than other action films.  There are a couple central mysteries that the plot wraps itself around.  Each of these mysteries are investigated through various means including Stephen Rea as a detective brave enough to follow the trails.  Speaking of the cast, it is quite formidable.  V is, of course, played by Hugo Weaving who not many know off hand but will remember him as either Agent Smith or Elrond the elf.  Natalie Portman plays Evey.  In a terrific and ironic twist, London's dictator is played by John Hurt who starred in 1984, a film V for Vendetta has a lot in common with.   <br /> <br />V for Vendetta is about London in 2020, a time not very far removed from us, but utterly alien.  The United States has fallen from the power-country and Britain has reigned its head in a dictatorship way.  Sutler, the dictator in question, uses footage from around the world (some true some not) in order to subdue his citizens.  Citizens are told of the horrors in far off lands, the attrocities being committed.  And then is told that this \\"uber-protection\\" he utilizes is for his citizens best.  \\"See?  We don't have these problems here in London.\\"  True.  But the problems there are, arguably, worse. <br /> <br />V also owes a debt of gratitude to Guy Fawkes, the anti-hero who, in 1605, tried to blow up Parliament because of their laws that didn't given Catholics the same rights as the Angelicans.  In other words, the freedom to act and live as they deserved.  In 2020, 400 years after this event, the day has been all but forgotten and the citizenslive in blissful ignorance that they have given up all their rights. <br /> <br />What the film makers have done, though, is give us an interesting protagonist in V.  Is he mad?  Is he genius?  Is he right?  Wrong?  None of these questions are directly and the film makers leave the audience with more questions than answers as to what to think of this film.  People are drawing connections to current day situations.  I don't think this is unfounded, but instead of using the film to make a critique of our current culture, I believe they are doing something more interesting.  The London in this movie got to the way they were due to apathy and fear and allowing their government to usurp any rights and freedoms they have.  As free citizens, this movie instead evokes us and pleads with us to not let us get to that situation.  A situation in which it takes a 'terrorist' to knock some sense into the government and its people.   <br /> <br />A must see.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Did you ever wonder what life would look & feel like in the distant future? The designers of this film, in my opinion, created the most complete and captivating portrait of this ever made. With this DVD edition's enhanced picture quality, the rich details of the DUNE world pop-out like never before (the special effects also look incredible on this remastered-edition - much better than any GGI garbage being churned out by Lucas today).  <br /> <br /> The included extras alone make this a must-purchase item for every Dune fan. Though I wish they were longer, the mini-documentaries include great insights into the design that went into the film (though I love the actors & story, its the LOOK of this film that makes it so special - the costume and set design is not \\"science-fictiony\\" at all - it is so detailed and elaborate, it really makes the viewer feel like they are looking at a humanity that is grounded in ancient, universal aesthetic, but at the same time has underwent radically different experiences & truly evolved (for better & worse) over the thousands of years btwn our time & theirs.
6304385668|4.0|This powerful epic bounds you along with constant energy.  The fast pace of this movie often makes it difficult to follow at times.  Often this film feels like an action movie, and a slightly slower pace might have improved its production. One could also benefit from a healthy background of modern Irish History as well in order to follow the film better, and to see where it goes off the mark.  Almost all historical epics like this take liberties with the interpretation of events.  This movie certainly does so with a heavy hand at times.<br /><br />Neeson is first-rate as Michael Collins, no doubts about that.  He portrays the energy and strength of the \\"Big Fellow\\" with great gusto.  Its probably one of his best roles.  Alan Rickman plays a very dark De Valera, and thats where the film gets into some difficulties.  Implied here is that De Valara sought to destroy Collins.  While this is exaggeration the film shows how divided Irish sentiment was over the creation of ther Irish Free-State in 1921-22.  The film does a very good job at portraying these events in rapid, hectic fashion, which again can be difficult for the average viewer to follow.<br /><br />The British are as usual portrayed as Nazi's, or something quite close to that.  The heavy hand with which the director shows the British side of the story is indeed unfortunate.  Something more balanced in this regard would have made the film more mature in its outlook.<br /><br />All the actors save Julia Roberts put in fine perfomances.  I don't know why the \\"American Beauty\\" is portraying an Irish femme in this film.  A fair actress from Erin's shores surely could have done her role more justice.  The production qaulity is first-rate, and while there is some distortion of history, the average viewer will certainly get an idea of the complexity of Irish history from seeing this good film.  Some reading on The Irish War and the Irish Civil War of the 1920s would also help.

The performances by Liotta, DeNiro, and Pesci are stunning, and bring the Henry Hill story to life.  Joe Pesci's performance is especially noteworthy, and his Oscar was well-deserved.  Kudos to all involved in this sterling production.  Get this one; it's a keeper!
B000002MG1|5.0|Out of Time and Automatic for the People are music perfection to me, the sound of the greatest band of my time hitting their peak. Was a teenager at the time though, music sounded so much better then for some reason. I'm still a huge REM fan though, even if they can't seem to reach these heights anymore, I dont believe in that 'give up with your head high' rubbish, I hope they keep releasing albums forever.
B000088E6D|5.0|For those who enjoy smooth, soulfully-delivered pop, this album is a superb choice.  Simply stated, Michael Buble is the best artist in this genre since Frank Sinatra.  Rod Stewart tries to do songs like these, with mixed results, but Buble succeeds on a consistent basis.  Kudos to a fine artist.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I had been thinking about picking up this collection since I first heard about it. I wasn't overly excited because I always keep a copy of BTR on hand. It's been a staple of my collection for years. I recently visted Long Branch, NJ and it got me thinking about the boss again, so I picked it up. I agree with most of the other reviews, the CD itself is not much of an improvement over the original, but the 1975 concert shows Bruce at the top of his game. I wasn't just impressed, I was utterly blown away. Bruce and the band rocked for 2 straight hours. It was one of the tightest, most entertaining shows, I have ever seen. It gave me an even greater respect and appreciation for the man and his legacy. AWESOME!!!
B000CPH9I4|5.0|The Corrs' latest album is a collection of Irish songs taken from their late mother's songbook--hence it was titled HOME. Unlike their previous efforts, Home is a collection of Irish songs with tinges of pop, not the other way around. 2 songs resurface again on a Corrs album, 'Haste to the Wedding'(which appeared on IN BLUE special edition) and 'Old Town' (in UNPLUGGED). Both songs in their new versions were tweaked given fresh new arrangements, with OLD TOWN being more similar to the Thin Lizzy original this time. Love odes 'Peggy Gordon' and 'Moorlough Shore' tell of love that is powerful, young set in a more earthy backdrop of instruments that never fail to soothe the ear and tame the heart.  <br /> <br />The first single of the album 'Heart Like A Wheel' is an emotional piano piece with Andrea's sweet and heartfelt vocals, and 'Dimming of the Day' features Sharon on lead vocals--and she really owned this track. There are 2 songs sung in Gaelic. The first one, 'Buachaille on Eirne' (translated as 'Irish Boy') is just so beautiful, even though I didn't understand a word Andrea was saying, the piece was just so serene, uplifting and dreamy. The second gaelic song, 'Brid Og Ni Mhaille' also has Andrea singing acapella in the beginning of the song--definitely a highlight. It's just so nice to hear the traditional instruments full force in this album, the tin whistle, bodhran, violin--and it never gets tired.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album. It just takes you to another place and time, an enchanting land that you could call Home.  <br /> <br />TOP 5  <br />1. Heart Like A Wheel  <br />2. Buachaill On Eirne  <br />3. Dimming of the Day  <br />4. Peggy Gordon  <br />5. Black is the Colour  <br /> <br />
B00008H2LB|1.0|Rascal Flatts is closer to \\"Real\\" Hard rock or Metal then the likes of Linkin Park or Hawthorn Heights.Let's face it there is a reson this band has not released any new material in nearly 3 yrs and their last album was a colaboration of their greatest hits & Jay Z's. They are a quickly faded gimic. Honestly take a listen to Linkin Park or Hawthorn Heights granted they have hard driving beats and heavy gutar riffs and some \\"Screaming\\" but the also use alot of Electronica in their music. The fact every song they do has the very same theme as the last \\"No One Understands Me\\" or \\"Lifes not fair\\" and sometimes \\"You did me wrong I hate you\\" these guys have nothing original or socialy conscience to say outside their own little box. They sound less like the origins of Heavy Metal such as \\"AC/DC\\" or \\"Iron Maden\\" or Even \\"Motely crue\\" but more like crying teenagers moaning over rock beats and calling it Heavy Metal. Todys music world is pressed for sucess before the age of 25, without real life expereince to write lyrics and vocal maturity these band fall flat of the true greatness they have the potential to own. Without that \\"Life Experience\\" and \\"Edge\\" this may as well be the next effort of the Backstreet Boys going rock.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|So; even though they where signed without ever playing a show, Panic! At The Disco sound more rounded, experienced, and muture then bands that have played together for years.  The music is enjoyable, and the lyrics are amazing (go read \\"Invisible Monsters\\" and \\"Survivor\\" by Chuck Palahniuk to find the inspiration for at least two of the songs) <br /> <br />My favorites are:  \\"Time To Dance\\", \\"The Only Diffenrece...\\", \\"There's a Good Reason...\\", and \\"Build God Then We'll Talk\\"

B0006GAOCW|2.0|the cast was weak. and so was the  acting. the plot was unoringal. it was hard to make you want to love the characters.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I've seen both versions, theatrical and director's cut, and concerning the ability to understand what's going on (it's still not totally clear, to be fair) the director's cut is more helpful. Not to say that this cut gives it away, because that would be entirely untrue, but it shows very subtle ghosts of what could be thought bridges if you sit down with the film and enjoy it from all angles.<br /><br />The way I got the most out of this version is first by watching the theatrical cut. Then, go through and watch the deleted scenes and put them in place mentally. Try to listen to what the dialogue is not only trying to say but what it avoids saying to convey the intention of the scene. Now, that's really a big part in looking at the whole movie in different lights. Watch the director's cut now and it will be easier for you to employ more thought-based observations as opposed to rudimentary dialogue parallels. Buuut if you're not into all that, just watch this film. It's fantastic and ironic even if you're not trying to delve into its implications of divine intervention, time travel, and greed.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|It works for me. I especially like that it sounds familiar, without being predictable.
B00005JOWF|4.0|awesome..action never stops, fantastic butt-kicking fight scenes, super-high tech look to the entire film/actors airbrushed, buildings/vehicles sleek/fast paced, cool story..pay attention to the beginning for an overview of the storyline/ultraviolet's origin....a cross between xeon flux & dark angel..up there with with Underworld evolution as one of the best 2006 action/sci-fi/superhero flicks..so far..(X-Men 3 will sure be the best movie to come out this year..until then see Ultraviolet...can't wait to get this one on dvd!!!

076790592X|5.0|Everyone in life strives to be a better person, a more loving friend and family member, and lead a generally better life (or at least they should be). Well Mitch Albom has captured this view and laid it on paper in Tuesdays with Morrie. This astoundingly well written novel does it all. At times it will put a strangle hold on your emotions and threaten to tear the heart right out of your chest; others it will put you in a state of ecstasy and love of life. Still others it will pour out profound wisdom and give you a new outlook on the world you amble through. The overall content is second-to-none. <br /> <br />The meat of Tuesdays with Morrie's substance is only rivaled by the intricate yet easily comprehensible webbing of words Albom weaves to create this masterpiece. The picture he paints for each scene is simple, making it somehow familiar to the reader, and yet does so in a way that falls short of insulting even the most keen intellects. This is a work for all ages and IQs. I would place the general style of Albom's recollection of this time in his life as closest to that of Twain, not because of his ability to duplicate a southern drawl or northern twang on paper, but because of the overall familiarity of his diction. The people involved with Morrie Schwartz's life are portrayed as dynamic and witty, but still easily pictured sitting across the very room the reader sits in, talking about the weather and asking how the family is doing (this may due to the fact they are factual people and not a work of fiction, but i give Albom credit none-the-less). <br /> <br />I found Tuesdays with Morrie to be a wonderful work that can inspire the spirit and humble the heart. It has touched my life in so many ways, and I encourage you to give it the chance to do the same for yourself. You never know, you might find yourself turning pages to more than just a book...
038572179X|5.0|This has been my second McEwan book in four days. The first, Comfort of Strangers, completely unnerved me. Atonement surprised me. Unlike a few readers who have expressed their dismay over the details, I did not find them laborious at all. In fact, they allowed me to really live through those moments. Readers have also commented that they felt no connection with the reader. Do you have to? Sure, it helps, but an absence of one doesn't take away from a good story. I also didn't connect to anyone. Briony got on my nerves throughout that first part...but nonetheless, I found it to be a wonderful work of fiction.
0977326403|4.0|Jim Collins makes a very good contribution to the conversation about whether social sector organizations should become more like businesses.  He points out that many--most?--businesses are at best good (not great) and the goal of social sector organizations should be to become great organizations--a concept that cuts across the social and business sectors.<br /><br />One weakness of this monograph is that at least one of the five factors Collins identifies as the basis for great organizations--the hedgehog concept--does not, in its totality, slip neatly and fit well in the social sector.  This, however, is a minor weakness compared to the overall contribution Collins is making to helping strengthen organizations in the social sector.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|Being a very avid Pink Floyd fan, and owning all solo projects by each band member (even the really hard-listens like Fictitious Sports), I'm pleased to say that this album is easily the best of Dave Gilmour's solo works.  There's alot to like here.  You get quite a bit of the moodiness of the Pink Floyd sound, while listening to a collection of songs that is uniquely Dave's.  A good combination that often finds me skipping backward to listen to specific tracks a second and third time.   <br /> <br />Be advised that most of this album falls into the mellow category :)
0312323859|5.0|When I finished reading \\"Soemthing Borrowed\\" I didn't think there was any way I could believe Darcy's side of the story.

B000063JDE|1.0|This film is vile.  It features misogynist portrayals of women that are disturbing to say the least.  It features a graphic rape scene that served to be the most uncomfortable  thirty seconds of a film class ever.   <br />Women here are either 1: Doormats: Sandy taking back Geoffery after he has an affair with a married woman.  She forgives him because she loves him. Blah. <br />2.  Masochist Nymphomaniacs who ask to be hurt, seduce young men and allow themselves to be treated as objects.  <br />In a time and place where there is an ever increasing amount of violence towards women, this film is a disgrace. <br />Films like this give surrealism a bad name.  Its not surreal, its perverted.  If you want surreal, see a real film like Un Chien Andalou, not this very bad movie. <br />Yes, its bad.  On top of being incredibly offensive on multiple levels, it is littered with plot holes.  Once the film reaches a certain point, the plot becomes so convoluted that its absurd and many things are never explained.
156898443X|5.0|What a fascinating way to meet a man and know his world! This book inspires you to journal your own observations and struggles, and to observe MORE.  A beautiful story told in an unusually revealing manner!
B000000W8C|5.0|this album just has everthing. massive guitar riffs, incredible rhythm section, richard's vocals at his very best and layered to the max in the right places. songs about living and dying on your own and being a miserable selfish human. but actually there are moments of great beauty and honesty.  it makes you feel happy or sad depending on your mood. this album was pretty much overlooked by the mainstream at the time and yet it wipes the floor with ubran  hymns.  shows what the media and the general public really know doesn't it? <br />nick mcabe, what a guitarist.
B000002N2P|4.0|After Dookie, Green Day had created many things; a new sound in punk rock, an album that would be difficult to follow up, and a whole new generation of fans, hungry for new music. They had made huge success, purely by accident. That was unfortunate for them because they didn't want to dissapoint their fans. They made their most intense and most punk rock release yet; Insomniac.  <br /> <br />This is an exciting collection of songs bursting with energy. The themes of the songs are far different from Dookie, which was a theme of being bored, summertime feel. In this record, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong dives into the lives of many different people. Some are: A person who runs away (Westbound Sign), a drug dealer (Tight Wad Hill), a person who doesn't belive in himself (No Pride), A greedy kid who just wants his parent's inheritence (Brat). 86 was written about themselves, when they weren't accepted into where they used to call home. Brain Stew was written when Billie Joe couldn't sleep because his son was up all night crying.  <br />The instruments are also to be admired, especially Mike Dirnt's basswork (Panic Song, Stuart and the Ave.). The guitar is especially catchy on Geek Stink Breath.  <br />My favorite songs are- Stuart and the Ave., 86, Brain Stew, Geek Stink Breath, Walking Contradiction, Armatage Shanks, and Stuck With Me. My only problem is that most of the songs sound the same, and that's why it is four stars instead of five. I also love the artwork insisde the cd, it's so cool and I found myself staring at it for hours.
B000E33VWW|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in the last two years! \\"Capote\\" is a dark character study and perfectly acted by all, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman. After seeing this movie you will be playing it over and over in your mind.I feel if Hollywood would gamble on projects such as this one and others like \\"Good Night And Good Luck\\" it would be much more enjoyable to go to the movies. I've read \\"In Cold Blood\\", and in my opinion, \\"Capote\\" offers a unique balance between the authors life and book that transformed his life. This movie must be on your must see list!
0803731094|5.0|Our friends from the UK highly recommended this book as it received the British Smarties award.  I have to say my 2 and 4 year old absolutely love this book.  At the age of three my daughter had memorized this entire book and the clever rhyming.  It is a wonderful story and you will not be disappointed.
0064430170|5.0|It's a classic - every child should have this book when they are very young.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|If you want the whole life story of Johnny Cash...this is not the movie for you.  This is basically the love story between Johnny and June Carter Cash.  Although there are scenes outside their relationship for example the accident involving Johnny's brother and how it shapes his relationship with his Mom and Dad, and also features to some degree his relationship with his ex wife...this is really the story of Johnny and June up until his concert at Folsom Prison.  Personally I wish they could have expanded past that...but it would have made the movie way too long.<br /><br />Johnny Cash has a very distinctive look and sound that is hard to duplicate.  For the most part Joaquin did the best job to try to emulate him....is he perfect?  No...but, who could be?  Reese Witherspoon...was she the perfect June Carter Cash?  No but, she brought a vulnerability to the character and I can't imagine enjoying anyone else in the part.  The two brought a lot of chemistry to their scenes together that made them believable.
B0006399FS|4.0|It sounds like the album early U2 would've made for the 21st century. Or is it the album 21st century U2 would make for the early 80's?? No matter. Songs including \\"Vertigo\\", and the transcendent \\"Sometimes you Can't Make it on Your Own\\" prove they are more than still in the game, with great material. Still a great band. 'Nuff said.
B000268QB2|4.0|Good debut!  I like this cd much more than I expected. Definitely very compatible with COLDPLAY and RADIOHEAD style.  I am especially taken by the later tracks - \\"Untitled 1\\" and \\"Bedshaped\\" - which emulate experienced fellow-UK band MARILLION (in fact, I strongly recommend MARILLION cd's \\"Marbles\\" or \\"Afraid of Sunlight\\").  I look to be impressed by KEANE along these lines of greater maturity and depth in sound and style in their future material.  This is a good start and they certainly have my attention.
0380789019|5.0|This is my first Gaiman book and I enjoyed it all the way through.  I don't read a lot of sci fi but I will read other books by this author.  A great twist in the story and very believable characters.  Gaiman is able to paint a really clear picture with his writing.  I was able to see London below and all of the characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read!
B0000071ZV|5.0|Basias voice, his piano, all is good. <br />The sax intro in Good Times is just thrilling. I like to hit the back button 5 or 6 times on that intro before I let the whole song go. <br />One of those cd's I have played 100's of times in a decade of enjoyment. <br />I bought it thinking I just knew one song, knew at least half of them.
B00006GA48|5.0|This tiny trio from Flint Mich. created one of the best classic rock albums from that era,and the featured song is the song I'm Your Captain.If you want to listen to some really good butt-kicking music in your car,then buy this cd. <br />If you aren't familiar with this band allow me to recommend this offering.Lead singer and guitarist Mark Farner's voice his full,on-key and very soulful.The other members Don Brewer on drums and background vocals were very complimentary to Farner,and bassist Mel Schacher completed a very good rhythmn section to Farner's soaring guitar work.If you ever heard the song \\"We're An American Band\\",then this is the band who performed that song however this cd is three albums before that song. <br />Track 1 is also a tremendous bluesy hard rock song.Track 4 is also another very bluesy rock song,but the entire album is a true classic. The bonus items are okay,but not needed. Listen to what a damn good garage band sounded like in the early 70's as the record company they worked for allowed them to kick out the jams.
0393327655|2.0|Harris's claim that most conflicts in the world today are reducible down to differences in religious views is a gross oversimplification. Harris, conciously it seems, sits confortably with Samuel Huntington, Robert Kaplan, Thomas Friedman and others on the political and economic right who wish to demonize an entire culture while ignoring the historical economic and political contributions to these problems. Harris and others have attempted to whitewash how western secularists and imperialists, often one and the same, in many ways brought about the condition in which the current religious extremism is taking place.<br /><br />He does make a valuable point that religions and their accompanying thousands of years old value systems are very much outdated and in need of replacement through thorough rational discourse. As well, these value systems have most definitly contributed to the problems we face in the world today. This is no basis, however, upon which to ignore the complex origin of the problems that are unreducable to any one factor, whether it is economics, politics, race, or religion.<br /><br />While Harris calls Arundhati Roy \\"reckless and disingenuous\\" for her assessment of the west's view of the Pakistani/Indian conflict over Kashmir (pg. 28), I call Harris reckless and disingenuous for ignoring the complex nature of the worlds conflicts by attempting to reduce them to conflicts of belief.
0689878451|5.0|I purchased \\"And Tango Makes Three' for my six year old daughter and we both loved the book.  The illustrations are beautiful, the number of words on each page are age appropriate (not too long or too short), and the best part was that it was based on a true story.  Although my family is the traditional male & female parent household, I want my children to be understanding and accepting of all types of families and I think Tango opens the door to say, it's okay to have 2 male parents as long as they love each other and the child.  Even if you don't want to have a deep conversation with your child about lifestyle choices, you can simply read the story as a cute story about some silly penguins.  I think every family library should have this book!
B0007OCG56|5.0|This is not an Adam Sandler comedy, so don't get this if that is want you want to see. <br /> <br />This is Adam Sandler's first time playing a real adult, a role most Hollywood actors never play.  The theme is responsible parenting.   <br /> <br />If you have ever lived in Hollywood, as we once did, then you can  get a lot of laughs out of Tia Leoni's great comedic performance as a New Age Hollywood wife, and a solid supporting performance by Cloris Leachman.  But the jokes are insider baseball at Hollywood's expense.   <br /> <br />The plot has a few flaws; but it is so unusual to see a couple of grownups in any Hollywood movie lately, that for true movie fans who like really good movies, this is one you shouldn't miss.
B000003N8G|5.0|It's hard for me to think of an album that moves as fluidly from some very structured moments (arranged by Carla Bley) to what sounds to me to be more-or-less completely free group improvisation.  This is music that really travels to some different places, and for what Charlie Haden is doing here he has assembled just about the perfect cast of players, which includes Don Cherry, Gato Barbieri, Dewey Redman, and Paul Motian, just to name a few.  But the player who really brings this album together for me is a one I know little about - Sam Brown - on guitar.  He plays in a flamenco (and jazz) style that works very well in the context of this incredibly intense music.<br /><br />The melodies are based on folk songs from the Spanish civil war, and, as explained in the liner notes, the group was assembled in 1970 to protest the Vietnam War.  Such a explicitly political message is, I think, rare in jazz, but this music is so powerful it just works.  Charlie Haden writes in the liner notes, \\"The music in this album is dedicated to creating a better world; a world without war and killing, without poverty and exploitation; a world where men of all governments realize the vital importance of life and strive to protect rather than destroy it.\\"  It's good to see that Charlie Haden has brought together a new incarnation of this group to protest the foreign policy of George W. Bush.  The Liberation Music Orchestra create then and now important music with a timeless message that exists outside mainstream commercial concerns.
B000E8N690|5.0|Phoenix and Witherspoon really make this film. They are amazingly good performers who between the two of them have built up a remarkable resume of performances and top it off with this film.  Both of them deserved to win Academy Awards for the job they did and the fact that Phoenix didn't is only because P.S. Hoffman also did such a remarkable job. <br /> <br />Anyway, I was never a big Cash fan (had nothing against him, just didn't know much about him or his music) but this film really made you appreciate him and June Carter as people and as performers. For a thought-provoking, touching evening of film, rent this movie. <br /> <br />
B000E33VWW|5.0|Within the first several minutes of Capote, Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the title character reveals itself as phenomenal, the complete transformation in character that most actors could only dream of. Every solitary word, movement, and gesture is flawless, engrossing in ways equal to the best work of Brando, Di Niro, Olivier, and Penn. As far as reviewing films go, Capote plays out like a baseball game where one team scores 20 runs before the first out. <br /> <br />Truman Capote, the (in)famous writer and celebrity gossip machine, was not an easy figure to grasp. He was a brilliant writer and man in general, with no qualms about gleefully showing his genius off. He was also as effeminate as three Miss America pageants, deeply insecure, with a childhood that would outright obliterate lesser men. Early in the film we see him as the center of attention at a hip New York party, but minutes later he pays a bellhop to rave about his works in front of a pre-TKAM Harper Lee.  <br /> <br />Capote is drawn, almost mysteriously, to a small Kansas town where a family was brutally shot-gunned for no apparent reason. The locals do not quite know what to make of him, but he is charming and manipulative in a way they have never seen, and before long he has befriended everyone he needs to, including the sheriff (Chris Cooper). His ability to recall 94% of what he reads comes in handy for both interviews as well as impressing the citizenry. When the murderers are apprehended, he nearly jumps for joy, seeing an opportunity to write an amazing book, a `non-fiction novel'.  <br /> <br />Exploiting someone for material for a book isn't a pleasant experience, even if they are a murderer. Capote, ever seeking approval in a world he can never call home, barely even tries to defend himself when others accuse him of exploitation. When one of the killers asks Capote about the book's title, claims not to know, neglecting to mention that In Cold Blood has been decided upon. <br /><br />He immediately finds himself attracted to Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), a soft spoken but undeniably chilling man with whom Capote sees as both a kindred spirit and a gold mine.  His visits to Smith on death row are light on homo-eroticism and heavy on desperation. Smith desperately needs a friend, and does not want to be remembered as a monster; Capote must balance his attraction and desire to help Smith with the fact that he needs a gruesome re-telling of the murder, and most morbidly, a final ending to his book. Life in prison won't do the trick. <br /> <br />Capote's relationship with Smith and experience when writing his masterpiece becomes all consuming, dragging his psyche into places more horrific than even he imagined. Smith can appear gentle and pained, but the vicious murderer never moves far under the surface.  When Capote finally hears Smith's calm and straightforward description of how he murdered an entire family with no remorse, Capote's soul crosses the point of no return. <br /> <br />Nothing short of spellbinding, gut-wrenching, and brilliant, Capote deserves recognition as an instant classic. Masterfully crafted on every level and with physically palatable power, it epitomizes why the movies are the most poignant and relevant art form today.  <br />
1592401791|5.0|This book is full of great stories about a classic band with amazing songs, a famous producer and a young kid who turned out to be a world-class engineer. Geoff Emerick tells it like it is, and after reading the book, I can never listen to Beatles tunes the same way. It's edgy, agressive and truthful, and I couldnt put it down. Whether you are in the music biz or not, I consider it a must read. Well done....
0977326403|5.0|This was a wonderful viewpoint for church professionals. It really helped make the Good to Great useful for us.  We were able to pick up some ideas from Good to Great. This monograph put some of the principles in language that we could use.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|The point of the show is not sex.   <br /> <br />The real beauty of this show is being able to watch these characters transform from Season 1 to 6, and how flawlessly the writers are able to make these changes, and how the actresses make you belive in these growths.   <br /> <br />The sex scenes are not meant to be erotic most of the time.  They, from what I can remember genreally, are played for comedy.   <br /> <br />And, might I remind everyone, that the forgien press, and not Americans, chose to award Sex and the City with numerous Golden Globes across the six season span, so more people love this show then just its domestic audience.   <br /> <br />Lastly, the fact that these women eat in expensive restruants, wear expensive clothes, and go out every week is not meant to be taken seriously.  The show is not telling viewers: YOU SHOULD LIVE LIKE THIS.  These factors are amplified for artistic purposes, to make the show a heightened reality.  If they didn't go out, and meet new characters, it would be a plotless sitcom.  And, as a minor note, it fits into the diagetic world of the story, being that these women are more on the 'upper class' side.   <br /> <br />But, some people have obviously missed the point.   <br /> <br />Get a grip.  Sex and the City is Brilliant!!!!
0393035158|4.0|Sam Harris does an excellant job of presenting the corrupt ethics of mystic religious faith, or any unreasoned faith, for that matter.  His vision of the consequences of faith to the socities of the world today is rather bleak. The limits of his book are most evident in the lack of a functional perscription for healing the mess.  Lets hope someone, with as much insight, can formulate and communicate a solution to lead us off the path of conflict and distruction so dramatically outlined by Mr. Harris.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Great stuff here.    The title track is without a doubt one of the highlights of the album.. It's one of those strange funk songs that Prince was known for back in the day. Something he really didn't do on this last album. 4/5    Lolita is the second song and it's more pop commerical than the first album.. It's the type of song the girls are more likely to enjoy... Although I must say it contains the nifty line \\"You try and write checks that your body can't cash\\" but it's still a solid track. 4/5    Te Amo Corazon is an extremely mellow latin type of song. It's something that will not appeal to everyone, but it can grow on you alittle if you give it a chance. 3.5/5    Black Sweat is another highlight... It's another song with Prince trying to go back to the glory days with his strange funk. The beat is very catchy and it's a song you can dance to. 4.5/5    Incense and Candles is actually one of my favorites... It's a duet and has a modern feel and almost rap feel to it. I don't usally like these type of songs, but this one works for me. 4.5/5    Love is another dance song with a really catchy beat. I think it might end up being an overlooked track on the album due to Black Sweat and Lolita and some others. The lyrics aren't overly impressive, but I listen to Prince cause me makes me wanna dance=)4/5    Satisfied is like an oldtime blusey soul type of song. This is Prince at some of his most soulful. Enjoy this one very much. 5/5    Fury while not sounding as good as it does live, is still a  monster of a song. A hard rocking funky song with a catchy   beat. Truly one of Princes best since back in the mid 90's atleast.He rocks out on this one and shows he's always been a very underrated guitar player. 5/5    The Word is one of the downers. True, the music is catchy at times, but it isn't catchy enough to tolerate Prince being preachy here. But hey, can't win them all=) 2.5/5    Beautiful, Loved & Blessed is VERY poppy syrupy, but it will make a great soundtrack song.4/5    The Dance starts off kind of boring until around the 2:15 mark and then it kind of picks up when the piano kicks in. 3.5/5    Get On The Boat goes back to the latin type of feel.  Good latin funk jam.. But the horns are kind of annoying here. 4/5     There's only one track that I'd consider a throw away.. And some will even like \\"The Word\\" so it's a great album. Not as great as some his 80's stuff. But it's still worth 4.5 stars. Should be up for album of the year... But with the way music is today, who knows?    Top Tracks:    Fury  Black Sweat  3121  Love   Satisfied  Incense and Candles
B000BB1MIC|5.0|ok this is a good boxed set and season.......At first glance you may absolutly hate Logans guts but in the end you end up loving the guy it goes back to home base and this season brings the Gilmores back to what you know and love.... <br />the sudio is great and the picture is sharp and clear and the blacks are perfect never mind the features do i need to start? Absolute delight all the way around! Very interesting and educational to a Gilmore perspective!  <br />Must have for all fans and a great show to watch with your Mom! <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|all you people with bad things to say about this album should check your ears. Top two album of the past two years, and frankely the man is 63 and still making great music. Every song, is captivating and breathtaking, and with Paul's genious use of every instrument possible wonders the listener. Truly great album.
B00005ATQH|4.0|Like the novel, Kubrick's LOLITA is about a middle-aged man who falls in love with a 12-year-old girl (is she 14 for the movie?  I think Sue Lyon was 16 when she filmed it).<br /><br />So is LOLITA a pedophile's dream?  No.<br /><br />The novel delves deeper into the obsessive love of Humbert for Lolita and sounds closer to a genuinely romantic novel than a sordid, smutty porn story, so most seriously-ill pedophiles will be bored and disappointed by the novel's lack of physical details.<br /><br />And Kubrick's movie?  It can only hint at the relationship, fading out at the beginning of anything controversial and then masking the intimacy in bland dialogue after the fact.<br /><br />So the film becomes the Humbert & Quilty show, focusing on the two men's darkly hilarious struggle to obtain the little girl, even as she grows into her own defiant teenage lover.  James Mason and Peter Sellers were perfect choices to bring these characters to life.  Mason's European manners and emotional collapse make Humbert a sympathetic character and Sellers' zany take on the dark, daffy Quilty is cinematic gold.<br /><br />Shelley Winters is wonderful as Charlotte, \\"the Haze woman.\\"  You laugh at her ridiculous attempts to impress Humbert with her faux sophistication and then seduce him with her misguided wiles--but then your heart breaks when Kubrick's camera lingers to catch her tears.<br /><br />And Sue Lyon is beautiful.  She's a pouty little brat--even though our first look at her is stretched out on a lawn in a bikini--but her knowing little grins later in the film suggest all the \\"growing up\\" she's had to deal with under her stepfather Humbert.<br /><br />(Just my opinion but I don't think another actress really nailed the teenage girl until Juliette Lewis in Scorcese's CAPE FEAR.)<br /><br />Also like the novel, LOLITA the film still causes a lot of debate to this day.
0060763280|1.0|I forced myself to read the first few chapters of this book convinced I just hadn't gotten to the good stuff yet. Well, the entire book is just a collection of feel good positive thinking mumbo jumbo. Complete waste of time. Finally just couldn't take it anymore.
B00001SIES|3.0|Compared to Muse's other CDs (Origin of Symmetry/Absolution) this CD is somewhat of a let down.  It does contain a few songs that are really good, but the rest of the CD does not meet up with the standards I expect from Muse.  Muse is one of the great bands to come out of England, and most of their music is fantastic, but this CD is just not their best work.
B000002KIE|3.0|Let's ignore all the hype about the image and the antics of these anti-social jokers. If you are in the mood for some snarling raucous punk then this certainly will hit the spot. I like it, but I couldn't listen to this or anything like it non-stop. No doubt that God Save The Queen is a punk classic - \\"she ain't no human being\\" - what a hoot.  Bodies, EMI, and Liar will also get your toes tapping. As far as the Pistols being pioneers or godfathers of the punk movement I would say that's a bit of an overstatement.
B000683VI4|5.0|This was a great movie. I would recommend everyone except children see it. I loved it! It was funny at times and sad at others. The sexual scenes were not so distasteful that it was disgusting. It made you feel how much in love the characters were. It let us know that no matter how vibrant and full of life a person is there is no guarantee we will remain this way forever. It can be taken from us without any warning. It made me feel what real love is between two people.
1577311523|5.0|This is a difficult book to read. It reveals the very core of our human condition and strips away all of the pretense and wishful thinking that makes up our corporate religions and other meaningless institutions. It is advanced teaching, and as such, offers no comforting lies to soften the blow of the realization we have, in fact, evolved beyond our usefulness on this planet. We have become insane in our cruel treatment of each other and in the abysmal treatment of our planet. But, there is hope. If we give up our cherished dream of power and control, and let slip away this ego in us who doesn't exist at all in that place, no smaller than the Universe, where the real is unseen, and where the material has no true substance. In that place, joy is all that there is and love is all that really matters.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This remake of a classic is just WONDERFUL !!!  I could not get enough of the love scenes !  Mr. Darcy's eyes were so soulful and meaningful that it captures your whole being as he expresses his feelings to Elizabeth !!!  I don't know if anyone can top the fabulous job that Matthew MacFadyen did !!!  SOULFUL EYES !!! I was captured in their love story !!! A definite must have for anybody's collection !!! Perhaps the same characters can also do Pemberly or Pride and Prejudice Continued by Emma Tennant !!
0316743003|5.0|This is simply the best and most informative book on the development and manufacture and testing of these amazing aircraft from the U2 and Blackbird to the Stealth Fighter F117. It pays homage to the fortitude and determination of a breed of men who would follow their vision through despite official ineptitude and conservatism. Many leading political figures do not come out well. The late Ben Rich and his team are a lost breed now but we owe them a great debt of gratitude. I will keep going back to this book for years to come.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Like the movie, this is pretty delightful and fairly nondescript music - but in a good way.  It's pretty perfect actually.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is arguably Joss Whedon's best work. I loved the movie and also loved the series Firefly (sadly cut down in its prime bu unimaginative network marketing morons, which I had to order on DVD because we don't get to see much that's good here in Australia). The western and space elements are well blended and are only silly when they're meant to be - quite an achievement. The characters are great and the drama and humour are mixed with a skill that Hollywood usually cannot manage. In places it's like Mad Max (Road Warrior to Americans) in space, when the Reavers turn up to terrorize everyone. Joss gives us tough guys and mercenaries and rebel geniuses and space battles and air battles and brawls and assassins and hackers and love and tragedy and humour and rebellion lost causes and lots more. If you don't see this movie you're missing out.
B00008DDHZ|4.0|Even if you are not well-versed in the history of the subject matter you will be mesmerized by the technique employed by Paul Greengrass. It is simply astonishing the level of realism acheived within. Several times I got lost in the story, immersed as if I were watching a documentary and not a staged production. Very engrossing and several good supplements including commentary and a visit to the present-day real-life locations depicted in the film.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|The Sex in the City complete series is a pleasure.  The case keeps everything tidy, the CD set includes special features as well as interviews, plus a great trivia game. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this giftset.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|\\"Contemporary\\" \\"Christian\\" \\"music\\" has no signature sounds and is boring as being slumped over dead in a wheelchair. So it comes as a huge surprise to hear something so utterly creative, so wonderfully genius - from a Christian, no less. I am very impressed. This album is something I've come to appreciate with repeated listens (especially with a good pair of headphones). I can hear why this was lauded to critical acclaim as a best of '05. Terrific arrangements and instrumentation make this one of those records you can \\"find\\" things buried after multiple plays. Great stuff. If ever a remake of Milos Forman's film \\"Hair\\" is ever produced my vote goes to Sufjan Stevens to write the songs and score it.
0307263118|4.0|This is a quiet book--subtle in its intensities, as are most of our lives, but more deeply moving for that subtlety.  It is like a miniaturist painting, one person coming to terms with his own life and his own longings and, most of all, his own mortality.  A wonderful, meditative read.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I bought this movie sight unseen which is something I never do but I had read so many glowing reviews, at more than one site, so I took a chance.  It's the best movie I've seen since the 1995 version of Pride & Prejudice.  Richard Armitage gave the best performance I've had the priviledge of seeing as Mr. Thornton though all the performances were wonderful.  I enjoyed all the scenes Thornton had with his mother as well as the union leader, Higgins, but it is his love of Margaret Hale that drives the story.  The last scene is the most romantic scene I've ever seen on film.  I highly recommend this movie - you won't be sorry.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is a classic. Natalie Portman in an amazing debut, Jean Reno and Gary Oldman are unforgettable. <br /> <br />Be sure to get this extended version of this movie. It's far better than the theatrical version.
B000002B7M|5.0|This is a MASTERPIECE. A Classic featuring the best playing of the time. Rhoads at his best, a ripe Ozzy and a nice Keerslake/Daisley rhythm section. <br />Unfortunately... it was RE-RECORDED lately and re-issued with Mike Bordin and Robert Trujillo taking places over the original bass and drums tracks. The result being horrible, not because of bad playing, but of a very poor production work, ends up being unnacurate, poor sounding, and not tight at all. <br /> <br />Being a musician myself, and understainding Ozzy's position regarding lawsuits, I must admit this is a step towards non-beligerant options regarding the issue of the two first Ozzy-as-solo-artist records. However, even tho I respect a lot Bordin's and Trujillo's work (they are both fine musicians), I find the end result on this reissue simply disgusting. And not being Bordin and Trujillo's fault precisely. There is a SEVERE lack of precision in the production work, being that there are less-than-discreet differences on sound, on TIMING and what was originally played. It is harder to copy or re-create a work done twenty-something years ago on a note-by-note basis, but what else do fans expect? I mean, nobody ever imagined (or wished) a classic album should be re-done on this fashion, but if you EVER had the original recording, and have a little bit of attention paid to the work here, you will find lots of flaws and missing things, or a loose rhythm section \\"following\\" the pre-recorded guitar work, instead of it being the basement for the rest of the music (as it should be...).  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it is difficult to tell this reissue from the original one if you're trying to buy it \\"new and used\\" over a website. I got the reissued re-recording instead of the 1995 edition (with the small artwork over a big blue background) since the seller seem not to notice the difference between them, and am severely dissapointed. A clever example of what should never be done to a classic...
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I was very please with this item.Very surprise with how fast I recieve it. Great condition.Enjoyed the set. <br />will purchase from amazon in the furture.will recommend <br />to freinds and associates. <br /> <br /> <br />                                  Thanks a bunch
B0000029LG|5.0|Michael Jackson may be one of the most mysterious people on earth.  His life and his experiences are probably much more than any of us could imagine, but this album (by far his most personal) gives you a little peak into who he really is.<br /><br />HIStory is aptly named as it gives you a \\"history\\" of his music to date with a greatest hits collection on disk one and then gives you \\"HIS story\\" on disc two.  Disk two is definately my favorite MJ album.  You get the sense that it was written largely as an outlet of emotions that Michael felt after going through the allegations of 93/94.  The album has an angrier tone than his others, and you get the sense that you know him a bit by the end.<br /><br />1. Scream: the album starts with a duet between Michael and his sister Janet.  It's obviously a push by the record company to cash in on the superstardom of these two, and as a result it's a little overproduced and noisey.  But the message is true to the tone of the album and lyrics like<br /><br />\\"Tired of injustice<br /><br />Tired of the schemes<br /><br />The lies are disgusting<br /><br />So what does it mean\\"<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"Tired of you tellin' the story your way<br /><br />It's causin' confusion<br /><br />You think it's okay\\"<br /><br />it sets the stage for the anger of the rest of the album.<br /><br />2. They Don't Care About Us: This song is much better on the production front, smooth background vocals and strings compliment the driving beat well.  The lyrics are clearly meant to cause controversy and grab attention, because Michael loves attention- and there is no better way to get attention than by causing controvsey.  The song is one of my favorites of MJs, and was very successful in some parts of the world- including Brazil where the video was filmed.<br /><br />3. Stranger in Moscow: Quite possibly Michael's best song EVER.  The song is melancholy and shows the sadness he felt after the allegations, \\"Swift and sudden fall from grace/ sunny days seemed far away\\".  Michael has said that he wrote the song in a hotel room in Moscow, while listening to the screams of fans below, but realizing that he was completely alone: thus \\"how does it feel when you're alone,and it's cold inside?\\" it feels like a \\"stanger in moscow\\".  This (or earth song) is probably my favorite MJ song of all time.<br /><br />4. This Time Around: The production on this song is horrible in my opinion.  The \\"music\\" sounds more like noise.  But the lyrics seem to be quite theraputic.  \\"They really want to use me and then falsely accuse me\\".  This song was basically nothing more than a way for Michael to vent his anger over the 93 allegations.  And he seems to vow to \\"stay away from strangers\\" \\"this time around\\" but it didn't seem to stick as he ended up in another mess after being accused by welfare frauds and professional plaintiffs in 2003-2005.<br /><br />5. Earth Song: If Stranger in Moscow isn't the best song MJ has ever done, then this is.  Earth Song may be the most powerful ballad I have ever heard.  Unlike his earlier Heal the World or We are the World, Earth Song does not plead for people to treat the world better- he vents his anger over the damage we've already done \\"what have we done to the world, look what we've done\\".  The song has no words in the chorus- words can't express the pain and suffering humans have caused in this word- the chorus is simply a cry, Michael's expression of the world's pain.  The climax of the song is truly phenomenal, and all you can do is sit back, crank up the speakers and let the emotions pour through you.  The song was a HUGE hit in Europe and Britan, but was never released as a single in the US.<br /><br />6. D.S.: The initials here stand for \\"Dom Sheldon\\" accordign to the lyrics, but anyone who has followed Jackson's legal troubles knows that this song is a thinly veiled reference to Tom Sneddon- the District Attorney of Santa Barbara County, California.  The DA headed up both investigations of Jackson (dropping the 93 investigation when a grand jury said they couldn't not come up with any evidence to indict Jackson even after Sneddon went through all the trouble of strip searching Jackson and having his genitalia photographed and videotaped.  Sneddon then lost the 2003 investigation after a jury found Jackson not guilty on all counts, despite putting 5 prosecutors on the case and spending $6 million prosecuting Jackson).  Jackson lashes out venomously at Sneddon, accusing him of everything from not having a social life to consorting with the KKK (one of Sneddon's sons got into trouble in the late 90s by hanging out with a skin-head gang).  The song's chorus is rather repetitive- \\"Tom Sneddon is a cold man\\" over and over.  But there are many who would agree as Sneddon has been sued for malicious prosecution 14 times during his rein as DA.  The song seems to be meant more for Michael's good than for listeners but the song does have a fun guitar riff and is easy listening.<br /><br />7 Money: This song is clearly aimed at Jackson's accusers \\"they dont' care, they use me for the money/ they dont' care they sue me for the money\\"  \\"lie for it, die for it, you would do anything for money\\".  Ironically enough, Jackson was sued again by Evan Chandler (who made the accusations of molestation for his son in 93) for making this album.  Evan felt the album violated the confidentiality agreement Jackson signed as part of the settlement in 94- saying he would not publicly discuss the case.  But Evan also added Sony to the defendants in his case asking for $60 million.  The case was eventually thrown out of court some 6 years later when neither Evan nor an attorney representing him showed up for a hearing in the case.<br /><br />8 Come Together: Jackson is self-proclaimed Beatles fan and this cover is definately one of the best Beatles covers ever done.  The song was recorded much before most of the other material on the album, and in fact a video of Jackson performing the song appears on the Moonwalker video Jackson released.  The song is a good cover, and gives the listener a break from Jackson's anger in the album.<br /><br />9 You Are Not Alone: This R. Kelly song was a huge hit for Jackson world wide and was his last number one in the US.  The song is a beautiful ballad- radio friendly, but lacks the emotion of other songs on the album.<br /><br />10 Childhood: This song embodies everything Jackson has always claimed about himself:<br /><br />\\"No one understands me<br /><br />They view it as such strange eccentricities...<br /><br />'Cause I keep kidding around<br /><br />Like a child, but pardon me...<br /><br />People say I'm not okay<br /><br />'Cause I love such elementary things...<br /><br />It's been my fate to compensate,<br /><br />for the ChildhoodI've never known...\\"<br /><br />\\"Before you judge me, try hard to love me,<br /><br />Look within your heart then ask,<br /><br />Have you seen my Childhood?\\"<br /><br />The music in the song is absolutely beautiful, the strings and piano tell a story the way classical music does.  You can feel the emotion of the song in the music.  Overall, it may be a bit sappy, but then again- overall, Michael Jackson is a bit sappy.  Jackson himself has said that this song is the most autobiographical he has ever written.<br /><br />11 Tabloid Junkie: Here Jackson vents his anger at the press that continually twists celebrities stories just to make a buck.  \\"It's slander/With the words you use/You're a parasite in black and white/Do anything for news\\"  The song is catchy and has an interesting drum percussion sound that is not a drum, but actually Jackson beat boxing.  Not his best work, but catchy enough to listen to.<br /><br />12 2 Bad: This another song that is a little overproduced and noisey, but the message is what's important.  Jackson again speaks to his accusers, letting them know they havent' won:\\"Look who's standing if you please/Though you tried to bring me to my knees/Too bad too bad about it\\" The song appears in Jackson's short film \\"Ghosts\\".<br /><br />13 HIStory: The title song, is not terribly impressive.  News clips are scattered throughout the song and get a bit distracting.  It's a nice thought but borders on cheesy, but then again, Jackson likes cheesy.  The chorus is beautiful- the smooth vocals and harmony you expect from MJ.<br /><br />14 Little Susie: This song is quite unique.  It's not the type you would hear on the radio, yet it is haunting and beautiful.  The song was written for a little refugee girl from Africa who was adopted by a family in Britan but was locked in a basement and died of neglect.  The song has a gothic feel to it, and the music sounds like a horror movie version of carosel music.  The lyrics tell a sad story and remind the listener how important it is to have compassion and care for others.<br /><br />15 Smile: Jackson is huge fan of Charlie Chaplin, so it only makes sense for him to cover a Chaplin penned song.  He does it beautifully, it may be his best vocal performance ever.  And after the anger and sadness of the album, he leaves you on a high note: reminding you to just \\"smile, when your heart is breaking/ smile even though it's aching\\" \\"Smile, what's the use of crying /You'll find that life is still worthwhile /If you'll just Smile\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend the album, for Jackson fans and non-fans alike.the Moonwalker video Jackson released.  The song is a good cover, and gives the listener a break from Jackson's anger in the album. <br /> <br />9 You Are Not Alone: This R.

0679441018|1.0|This book is not reccomended for any fan of  Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Overly religious, overly emotional, unrealistic and rather disgusting in parts it is definitely enough to put off all but her most ardent fans. Rice abuses the character of Lestat more than ever making him  into a shallow, fanatically religious emotional wreck who uncharacteristically falls in love with  Dora, the religious and frankly rather dull daughter of a wealthy New York drug dealer. The plot is jerky, sentimental, improbable and uninteresting and the book, overall, seems to be liitle more than a showcase for Rice's religious views.

0375805613|5.0|I always loved this book when I was a child, as did my mother, and now my daughter loves it too.  She loves Grover, but then who doesn't, he is cute, adorable, loveable, furry, and blue :)
B00004RJ74|5.0|This film is relentless and very exciting. Some of the CGI effects don't quite cut it, for me, and some of the vampire make-up and acting is a little fake looking, but that aside, there are no other flaws in the film.<br /><br />Great music, gore, acting, and crash and burn style writing!

B000E8N690|5.0|Hearing so many positive and glowing reviews of \\"Walk the Line\\" I looked forward to seeing it, once it was on DVD.  I worried that like many films you anticipate watching, I would be let down.  Happily, I was not disappointed in the least. <br />While \\"Line\\" is the story of Johnny Cash, it is more than just that - - it's really the story of a love affair that not only took ten years to culminate but according to Cash himself, saved his life. <br />Despite the wealth of material to choose from in Cash's life, the film spans basically from 1955 to 1968.  There are several brief scenes from Cash's childhood, establishing his family structure (or lack thereof), his early love and interest in music and a tragic family accident that led to years of guilt for Cash.  The film then flashes forward to Cash being in the Air Force and writing songs, then being married to his first wife, Vivian and attempting to make a go as a salesman.  As we all know, Cash was no salesman, unless it came to his music.  On a fluke, he sings for Sam Phillips and before you know it, he has a record out and is quickly touring with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and June Carter.   <br />In my opinion, these are the best parts of the film.  Cash's interaction with the lovely and honest June, and being part of the tour circuit.   <br />Of course, with all the adulation and success comes the downfalls -- the alcohol, the drugs and the women.  And Cash falls prey to all of them.  His family life suffers as he is away from home touring, and when he is home, he is preoccupied and getting his fix.  Perhaps the weakest part of the film is the lack of development with the storyline on his first marriage.  Obviously his boozing, pill popping and womanizing take a toll on his marriage -- but that avenue isn't really explored.  Cash and Vivian do seem to fight and disagree a lot and eventually they do divorce -- with Vivian taking their children.   <br />June Carter, meanwhile, has had her own bumpy lovelife.  She has divorced her first husband, much to the consternation of some of the strict religiously zealous citizens who feel that marriage should be forever.  She married for a second time, but not happily.  She has two young daughters to raise and she is in love with Johnny Cash.  <br />As Cash spirals downward into drug and alcohol abuse, June is there to help him pick up the pieces.  She stays by his side and helps him kick his dependency.   <br />The movie ends with Cash's live performance at Folsom Prison, before those inmates who can relate to his music, and a performance in Ontario, where Cash proposes to June on stage. <br />This film could have gotten bogged down in detail, or just not clicked.  Biopics are very hard to do - - particularly with such a public figure, beloved by so many.  But this film succeeds and succeeds so well mainly because of the performances. <br />Joaquin Phoenix simply amazed me as Johnny Cash.  I forgot I was watching Mr. Phoenix as Johnny Cash, he transformed himself INTO Johnny Cash.  You could see the pain his eyes, speaking of his brother, his guilt, his dependency on the drugs and alcohol and his deep love for June.   <br />Reese Witherspoon is perfection as June Carter Cash -- her physical loveliness would be enough to make someone fall in love with her, but her strength and heart shine through. <br />Phoenix and Witherspoon's singing together is phenomenal.  I am not a country fan, nor did I know much about Johnny Cash before this film, but I found myself tapping my foot along to the music and looking forward to the next musical number.  Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon shamed themselves in any way by doing their own singing - - they both looked completely natural playing their respective instruments and singing along with each other. <br />This film was an absolute delight and makes clearly evident why both Phoenix and Witherspoon were nominated for Best Acting honors.  You will end the film not only with Cash's songs in your head, but with the deep love he shared with June in your heart.    <br />Definitely one of the best films of 2005.  Highly recommended. <br />
B00004XMV6|2.0|There was absolutely no chemistry -as far I could see- between these two. When  they were together I felt nothing...the sex was intense but there was nothing which leads up to the sex scenes. <br /> <br /> <br />I liked the scene with the ice cube but as a previous reviewer stated the scene when he pasted her with honey had me feeling for a bath..i could just imagine that sticking sweet fly bait honey ...Most uncomfortable! <br /> <br /> <br />This is nowhere close to porn but I can see how it could be a bit risque for the 1986 movie crowd . <br /> <br /> <br />I never watch 80's movie as I find them almost all terribly bad with the music just as aweful. <br /> <br /> <br />This is  not a date movie....so beware of the reviews which say that it's an appropiate date film.
B000E97HIA|4.0|This is quite possibly one his finest works since he released 1996's Emancipation. There is something for everyone on this album. Hard synthed funk, rock riffs, and smooth R&B soul.  <br />1. 3121- The title track is very similar to Prince's Camille era which was roughly 1986-88. Very funky, with trippy layered vocals and a killer rock hook towards the end...reminded me of the Black Album's \\"Rockhard in a Funky Place\\". <br />2. Lolita- This track is almost homage to his late 70's and early 80's danceable synth funk. Very catchy with a great beat and funky lyrics. <br />3. Te Amo Corazon - Very slow latin jam, not my cup of tea, but smooth none the less. <br />4. Black Sweat - Could this be the \\"Hot Thing\\" of 2006? Minimalist funk and the second single. Great club anthem. <br />5. Incense and Candles - Ok track, could have done without the trendy R&B vocoder effect. <br />6. Love - Awesome track with killer blips and bleeps and beats abound. Great dance track that would also make a great club hit! <br />7. Satisfied - Could be a great follow-up to 1991's Insatiable...ironic. Diamonds and Pearls era sound.  <br />8. Fury - Great blend of synths and electric guitar riffs. Anthematic and reminded me of 1999 in some respects. <br />9. The Word - Smooth and funky jazzy, rock infused R&B. <br />10. Beautiful, Loved, Blessed - Duet track with Tamar. Ok. not my style. <br />11. The Dance - Slow ballad...sensual and slick. <br />12 Get on the boat - Funky infused tracks of many rockin Prince elements. Song about unity and fun! Funky closer. <br /> <br />Overall and very solid and cohesive effort. Personally, I found it much better than 2004's Musicology. 7 out of the 12 tracks are  amazing and worth the price of admission. If u like the harder funk and synthier Prince, this album is for u!
B0002CHIJW|4.0|After deciding to take a breaks from the busy city to write a novel Jenny decides to head to the country to settle down and do some writing.    Immediately after arriving at her destination she is harassed by the village nit wits and brutally raped not once or twice but three times but this gang of vagabonds.    The rape scene are especially graphic and so is her vengence on these men.    This is a good film if you love to see good ole revenge films with naked beautiful women seducing men and then ripping them to shreds with sharpe objects.      This is a good film and I recommend it.
B00006LIRI|5.0|Just can't get enough of it. Have listened to it over and over since I bought this CD, and as a proud fan of U2 will get their other albums too.
B000000H48|4.0|Love this album, it completes the story started in the album Them. The music is tough, hard, and it gets you pumped. Some parts of the story are kinda sad and if you follow the story you're in for an emotional ride ending up with a big smile.
B000031XCR|3.0|If you are looking for a 'breathtaking' album, probably this is not it. Has some Celine Dion classics, but other tracks are just.. i didn't like them.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is deffinetely one of my favorite albums, by the rolling stones.  With a song like \\"You Can't Always Get What you Want\\" it  at least earns a good place among their entire career. This is where their career really started to shine if you will. I strongly recomend it.
4789011623|5.0|The best intro for beginers and/or refresher for intermediates I've yet to find. Extremely well done; uses more modern, but still polite, Japanese instead of the outdated wording that most other books offer. Make sure to the use Genki I textbook in conjunction with the appropriate Genki I work book and CD for optimal learning potential.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|I found the film to be good, but not great.  It does not rise to the level of the English Patient, nor sink to the depths of lesser known movies.  It is well done; though it moves a little slowly at times; the scenery is great; it is a story about social conscience; the characters have depth and are extremely well done; the love story is touching.  I liked it (a lot), but didn't love the movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Honestly, this is one of the best sci-fi series I've seen in a long time. The characters and their relationships are extremely well-written. It'll just make you sad when you're done watching the last episode. It's definitely worth owning! ~ Monica
1590581814|5.0|Here's a man who can write, this James Sallis.  Why he isn't perennially on the best-seller list is a mystery in itself.  Maybe not.  This novel is short, intense, laconic and spare with language.  It features a man who you might not want living next door.  He epitomizes the anti-hero in our modern society.  DRIVE is a kind of anti-novel.  The man's name is, well they call him Driver.  Not THE driver, just, Driver.  That's what he does for a living.  He drives stunt cars in Hollywood.<br /><br />It's not a full-time occupation, so he also drives for people who rob banks and other establishments where there are frequently large amounts of cash to be scooped up.  The book is set in Arizona and California, of course.  And it features a classical noir protagonist who never really had a chance, given his background and the people he falls in with.<br /><br />Driver has a conscience and he has a certain ethical creed.  When he drives for a heist, that's it.  He acquires the vehicle, plans escape routes, delivers the bad guys and takes them away after the job.  But he doesn't participate in the planning and he doesn't know who is being robbed.  He's a tightly focused very bright and very experienced specialist who is constantly learning, mostly from others' mistakes.<br /><br />The story begins with a rush and doesn't let up.  Ever.  Sallis grabs you on page one and never lets you go.  Chapter One, first sentence.  \\"Much later, as he sat with his back against an inside wall of a Motel 6 just north of Phoenix, watching the pool of blood lap toward him, Driver would wonder whether he had made a terrible mistake.\\"  Take a ride with a wonderful writer.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Congratulations to Poisoned Pen Press for its willingness to go against the currents and publish fine literature that doesn't quite fit the mold.

B0000CBHOI|5.0|I don't consider this set to be the ultimate, but until something better comes out, it's the best you can find. I would have liked to have seen many more tunes in their entirety, but admit that the tidbits are tasty. The special features are a real plus, I admit, but I was left wanting more. The overall video and audio quality are as good as one could expect for the archival material and are excellent for the current material. <br /> <br />About the cost: The Amazon discount brings this down to 15 bucks per disc and although I love the material, if I'd had to have paid that price, I would have balked. I would understand the price for individual discs in the set being that high or even a little higher, but in a set, I expect a significant discount. These aren't DVDs you're going to watch over and over like you might some movie box sets, so the cost is a real concern. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|There's no doubt why Madonna is here to stay. This is the first Madonna album that I've gotten. I took a chance after seeing the sheer amount of positive-energy reviews here. With Confessions, Madonna has gone back into what she does best, exuberant dance music. Not only that, she futurized it with trancy techno elements. So cool is this album!

B000002G6J|2.0|Hello Friends: <br />My title says it all. <br />The music of Jobim is unparralled. His beautiful songs desereve five stars. <br />However the quality of the sound is very poor.  Possibly produced from old original recordings without sufficient modern technological correction and filtering.  Very poor quality. <br />L.Roly Jobin.
B00005JLR2|5.0|treasure plnet is the best movie ever. I wanted to watch over & over again! it is the a wonderful story. I think it needs to have 10 stars! It's about a boy who go's hunting for treasure, but on his journey he learns something more important. This movie is great!
B00005JNJV|4.0|Darkness, evil, and corruption...thats what you'll get when you watch this movie.  But for all the turmoil in Gotham, there is one beacon of hope, though this beacon is quite dark himself.  Bruce Wayne, played by the talented Christian Bale, is Batman, a hero for the people w/ his own set of problems...dating back to his parents murder when he was just a boy.  Throughout the movie he tries to deal with these issues while saving Gotham from \\"the bad guy.\\"   <br /> <br />The special effects in this movie are incredible.  Plus the batmobile just kicks a**.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for some dark, moody entertainment.
B000667FN8|4.0|Everyone on here keeps going on about how simple plan's not \\"punk\\" and what posers they are. Well, who cares whether they're punk or not as long as they make good music (and i happen to think they do)? Another thing, who decides what being \\"punk\\" entails, exactly? Who defines that?? <br /> <br />You also say that they always write about love and breakups and that they should get new problems. Name any band you consider good, and i bet they've written about love and breakups. And since you all are apparently dead set against \\"posers\\" don't you think it's a little ridiculous to try to say that they should get new problems? If those are the problems they have and know about, then that's what they should write about. I don't know what could be more poser-y than writing about problems they don't have. <br /> <br />Simple plan is a great band. They write about things all teens can relate to. I love both of their albums and I think everyone who likes rock should try them out. I'm sorry for sounding like such a whiner but some of those reviews made me mad. SP rocks.
B000E8NRR6|5.0|i guess i'm a bit confused by some of the previous reviewers' comments.  for instance, the gentleman/woman from montreal says that the dvd-a disc won't play on his/her system but says the \\"dvd-a is underproduced\\"...how one judges the production value of silence is beyond me.  then someone else says it's a rip-off b/c the \\"v\\" stands for \\"video\\"...well, the \\"v\\" in dvd stands for versatile, not video and nowhere on the special addition does it say anything about the disc containing video.  aside from the format wars between sacd and dvd-a, a big reason these formats will fade away is b/c many consumers are ignorant of what exactly it is but anyway... <br /> <br />the disc itself is a what any diehard steely dan/fagen fan would expect:  tight, layered arrangements, flawless production/engineering, and darkly funny lyrics.  there's a couple of tunes that don't grab me, but the rest of the material is so strong, it's more than makes up for it, i.e. h-gang, brite nitegown, and what i do particularly.  like all of the dan/fagen 5.1 discs, this is one that will leave you finding little nuances in the mix for many listens to come.   <br />
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I am not a huge chili peppers fan- I own every chili peppers album except the first three albums that were released in the 1980's.  I hate most music from the 1980's- including the red hot chili peppers music which was released in the 80's.<br /><br />Although I own all of the good albums, I would never go to a live chili peppers show.  I do not enjoy the atmosphere of a live show.  I saw the Foo Fighters live, and they rocked and rolled with authority, but some a------ behind me at the concert kept blowing his smoke in my direction.  I hate concerts because I have never enjoyed myself at live shows...<br /><br />...But this DVD is amazing.  The chilies rule.  The audio is superb- you get a choice of stereo, 5.1 DD or DTS!  The video is also anamorphically enhanced for 16:9 displays- this means you get to watch the show in 480P if you have the equipment.  Buy this bastard- and as the Who proclaim, \\"Long Live Rock!\\"
B00000ILDE|5.0|But this time, it's not The Aliens - I'll let you find that out for yourself.<br /><br />Ripley's back, and so are the aliens, lots of them, and they're hungry (as usual). She has a small army with her this time; for plot purposes, consider them edible. There's also a cute little girl to bring out Ripley's maternal side, for those moments between the shootups and the splatter. They save the best for last, though, with Ripley and the queen in hand to hand combat (not that either is really using hands).<br /><br />For once, the sequel is as good as the first - and the first was great. This is a fitting successor to \\"Alien,\\" which may still be the best scary-space-monster movie ever.<br /><br />//wiredweird

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I recently viewed this movie at a local theater and was so impressed with the movie that I ordered it from Amazon and waited with great anticipation for the delivery to my home.  I have not been disappointed by the DVD.  I ejoy the acting, costumes, music, scenery, and flow of the story.  This is a movie that I will enjoy watching many times.

B000301YY8|4.0|The day I heard the song 'You're beautiful...I grab for the James Blunt pick. His emotional outburst is there in the words....(And I don't think that I'll see her again,But we shared a moment that will last till the end....you're beautiful....) and in Bravery, it's heartfelt pouring of a soldier...(There are children standing here, Arms outstretched into the sky,Tears drying on their face.) His voice vibes with the guitars and makes a spell vibrating the lost love and pain...Its a feeling of a touching soul as he sings...(I saw you face in a crowded place,And I don't know what to do,'Cause I'll never be with you.)I also like Tears and Rain - he sings of his wishes and I ever wish, they be fulfilled! Out of my mind is one track that is a flowing beat and rythm with Goodbye my lover...deep from the heart wishing farewell. Whatever choice picks, I sure like James Blunt for my one of the exclusive collection.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is must, no question about it. Get yourself transported to another place and time. <br />This is the reason we used to go to the movies. You will watch it over and over again. <br />
B000002U8G|5.0|...and by that, I mean that Meddle is when they formed a sound of their own- a sound that would be very recognizable throughout the next several albums. It was explored somewhat on Atom Heart Mother, but even better here. This \\"new sound\\" was more ophisticated and mature than the last couple of albums, but at the same time, it was a very loose and and spacy sound- very enjoyable. It was when Pink Floyd got much, much deeper with their instruments, and made their instruments an actual part of their songs.<br /><br /> I think my favorite song here is One of These Days. It's where Roger's bass really gets to stand out, as do all of Floyd's instruments. And let's not forget about the amazing Echoes, I would never forget this song. Echoes is undoubtedly on of Floyd's best songs- right up there with Us and Them, Shine On you Crazy Diamond, Comfortably Numb, and many more. Pillow of Winds is a terribly underrated song, but it's one of my favorites off Meddle. It's very outer-spacy and, in my opinion, where Rick started to show what he could REALLY do with a keyboard(in MY opinion). Every minute is just pure enjoyment that would be further explored in the next couple ofr albums.<br /><br /> All in all, Meddle is one of their best, and is right up there with Dark Side and The Wall. It's too bad this album doesn't get as much attention as Dark Side, Wish, animals, and The Wall. Don't get me wrong, those album  are f***ing awesome, but there are other great Floyd albums too, like this one. Evey album before Dark Side is terribly underrated, and they deserve a lot more attention then they got back then or that they're getting now, Meddle especially. Go out and buy this if you're a Pink Floyd fan, or a rock fan in general, or someone who has good taste in music! This and just about every other Pink Floyd album out there. Hugely reccomened!!!
B000E994KE|5.0|As this was my first Amorphis album, I was wary. Reviews of their earlier releases mention saxophone, and even farther back, death metal. This does not have either of the two, thankfully, although harsh grunts make their appearance in several songs. These harsh vox usually are coupled with clean singing before and after. This combination adds conviction and power to the songs. In fact, \\"power\\" metal would be a great way to describe the sound on this album. Not power metal in the traditional sense, but metal where each songs leaves a powerful impression on the listener, whether it be from the powerful choruses (this is the case in nearly every song), the subtle yet memorable guitar work, or the effective use of keyboards and piano throughout.     Tomi Joutsen sings (or interperates, if you will) on Eclipse, replacing Pasi Koskinen. Tomi has been criticized by some reviewers for being a cheap Pasi knockoff, but comparisons between the two are folly. For Tomi is one of the highlights of Eclipse, his clean vocals coming somewhere between the lead singers of Sentenced and Danish band Mercenary. The growls don't sound like their coming from some ----head attempting to cover up the fact that he can't sing, these are (once again) powerful, commanding the listener to become almost a part of the music.    The music is melodic, and therefore instantly accessible, yet this is in no way \\"musical fast food\\" as in this will not be in and out of one's CD player in, say, a month. There are many layers to this album. The first few listens are highlighted by the choruses and the singing. After a little while, though, one discovers that there is more to this album. The rhythm guitar work, the soloing, the keyboard work, the instrumentation as a whole just prove that a band does not have to show off to impress, and that strong songwriting is what makes a song worthwhile, not instrumental prowess. Take the leadoff track \\"Two Moons\\" as an example, there is not a particular aspect or section of the song that is a highlight, the song as a whole is enjoyable from start to finish. And then \\"Leaves Scar,\\" which I believe is the single of the album, the harsh vocals are in there, yet not some cheap method to trigger nostalgia from older fans. Middle Eastern melodies and such are an idea that has been done to death in hard rock and metal, yet instead of going for the cheap \\"been there, done that\\" sound, Amorphis is much more subtle. The listener isn't blown away by that Middle Eastern sound, hell they might not even notice it, but by the end of the song, it stays in one's head until well after the album is over.    Surprisingly there are no weaknesses on the album, even the bonus track is worthwhile. I just wish that Amorphis had experimented with an epic song. \\"Empty Opening\\" is over seven minutes long, but much of the second half is just silence, like so many artists like to do for some reason. The only people that I could see not liking this are either people who insist on their music being evil or whatever the hell, or old-school Amorphis who are only looking for a return to their early 1990's sound.    This could be a breakthrough album for Amorphis, and could change the face of mainstream music the way Nirvana did. It almost certainly won't though, not while EMO and Fallout Boy still rule the airways. But what I mean is that this music is instantly accessible; even with the harsh vocals. Yet, even while it is accessible, it yields greater rewards for people like us who don't listen to a song for a month and move on to whatever the next song is to get played non-stop. For people like us who look deeper into the songs, and discover little things; a melody here, a section of a solo there. So turn down the lights, put Eclipse in, and let the music take you on a journey that few albums can.
B000002UA0|5.0|This is aother one of Pink Floyd's forgotten gems, and it that's too bad because Piper is another great album from them. Yeah, it's a little heady and a bit hard to get into at 1st listen, but once you're there, you'll never want to go back. Syd Barret is Pink Floyd's underrated genius, and it's too bad. He was a tortured artist, if you will, and it really shows on this record. It's also Pink Floyd's \\"headiest\\" album to date. Astronomy Dominae is easily one of Floyd's best songs, and my personal favorite of Piper is Chapter 24, wich seems to be the most underrated song here(I've read a lot of reviews saying that it's their least favorite track. Astronomy Domine is probably the loosest and funnest song here- very upbeat and what-not. It seems that every Floyd album before Dark Side had a hint of their signature sound. Each one had more and more songs that boasted that sound. Astronomy Domine was the 1st song Pink Floyd ever made that showed this sound, and that sound was extremely explored on Meddle, and was perfected with Dark Side. I guess you could say that with every album, Pink Floyd matured, and it all began with this album, the 1st, the most underated, and a great album. Get this right away if you're a floyd fan. Trust me, you wont be dissapointed!!!
B000E97HIA|5.0|This is an amazing album and should not be compared to any previous wroks by Prince. This the funkiest thing out there and currently. The album should be seen as a whole instead of track by track. Can't wait for the tour. From beginning to end 3121 is about liberation, salvation, and fun. It doesn't get any better than this. 3121, Don't U Wanna Come? I do and I am bringing a few of my friends too.
B00005JOE8|2.0|I thought after attending the stinkfest \\"Date Movie\\" and the painful \\"Ultraviolet\\" in consecutive weeks I would finally enjoy a movie in V for Vendetta.  How cruel the gods of entertainment truly are.  If I were to watch this film again, I would sneak a sleeping pill about a half an hour beforehand, enjoy the first explosion in the opening scene, sleep through the middle then have someone wake me up for the final explosion.  Explosion, nap, explosion; maybe then I wouldn't have objected so much to having put forth money to see this film.  That wasn't a spoiler either, as we know from the trailers what the ending of the film shall be.   <br /> <br />Natalie Portman plays Evey Hammond, a Londoner who works for the state sanctioned television network.  It's a London with obvious Orwellian rules regarding behavior, and Evey is caught after curfew by some non-uniformed enforcement officers who are preparing to rape her.  V, played by Hugo Weaving, intervenes and incapacitates the men before they can harm Evey.  He's wearing the mask of Guy Fawkes, an anti-Protestant  terrorist from seventeenth century who tried to kill off the protestant government of England by blowing up the Parliamentary building in London. <br /> <br />Soon enough, Evey Hammond is knee deep with V and is forced into hiding after helping V take over a television network.  I guess there's some plot in the movie, since we need to understand how we get from the beginning explosion to the ending explosion.  Fascists are involved, evil pharmaceutical corporations are involved, hypocritical priests and I think they even kill off a Rush Limbaugh type character in the mix.  The message the film sends about the evils of conservatism (of which I personally am one) is heavy throughout the film.  It's an unfair caricature for sure. <br /> <br />The obvious political message of the movie could be forgiven if it were simply a better film.  Natalie Portman's performance is unbearable.  It's hard to believe you're inLondon when the main protagonist can't maintain a British accent.  Portman feels almost lifeless in her role.  I guess that can be understood when you realize the other protagonist is a guy trying to act through a mask.  Hugo Weaving does his best, however it only takes a while to be completed frustrated by the mask.  Not only do we never see any facial expression, Weaving's voice is muffled and difficult to listen to behind the mask.  Eventually it's simply easier to give up trying to pay attention to the dialogue. <br /> <br />Not that the dialogue is bad.  There are some wonderful soliloquies and exchanges in the film.  Some.  V is put forth as an extremely witty and verbose former actor who delivers theatric performances as he's starting the revolution.  Those exchanges disappear about 20 minutes into the film. <br /> <br />There are some action sequences to the movie.  V carries around long daggers with which he fights.  The expectation of these sequences is very high considering the magnificent history the Wachowski brothers have had in special effects and cinematography with their Matrix trilogy.  However, all the action sequences (excepting the explosions at the beginning and ending of the film) come off flat and uninteresting.  The special effects are lackluster.  Huge disappointment. <br /> <br />V for Vendetta is an over hyped movie with occasional brilliance in dialogue combined with lazy special effects, tired action sequences, fatigued performances, plot holes, slow pace and a weak script.  Take a pass and save yourself the time and money.  <br />
B00008D1NF|5.0|What a great CD, each track lets allows you to explore new feelings, and it is a project that is not to be overlooked. The CD comes with lyrics in Portuguese and English, so you are really able to appreciate the music. Each of the voices compliment each other well in every track. Definitely in my collection of favorites.
B00028HBKC|2.0|This film leaves so much to be desired by the time the closing credits roll, you wonder why you sat through it in the first place. It appears to have absolutely no purpose... just meanders along violently... never giving... and there are few stories whether true or fictional that are better more exciting fare for good film-making than this -- so the plot was thick and ripe for an amazing movie experience... but they just didnt pull it off unfortunately. If you love the Jesus story you will be sadly dissappointed by this strange twisted desultory mess of a film.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|Based on the novella by Truman Capote, Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961) is one of those classic, quintessential New York City movies, like Sweet Smell of Success, The World of Henry Orient and Manhattan. It is a snapshot of the city at a particular point in time. It is also one of Audrey Hepburn's signature roles that she will always be remembered for.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn is absolutely adorable as Holly, an irresistible, charming individual. Under Holly's bubbly exterior, Hepburn's performance hints at a loneliness, an inner sadness. She conveys a heartbreaking vulnerability underneath her cheery façade. One gets the feeling that she needs to be rescued, to be saved and this gives the film a melancholic tone.<br /><br />She was wonderful chemistry with George Peppard who plays it cool, downplaying his role which acts as a nice contrast to Hepburn's flamboyance. He has a tough job of playing the straight man to Hepburn's colourful Holly. He is the audience surrogate. However, Peppard is excellent because he knows exactly how to react to all of Holly's outrageous behaviour. At first, his character seems a bit on the bland side but as the film progresses we get bits and pieces of his past which flesh out his character.<br /><br />The extras are a mixed bag at best.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by the film's producer Richard Shepherd. He candidly speaks about his opposition to Rooney playing a Japanese man but Edwards wanted his scenes kept in. There are quite a few lulls of silence between comments which makes listening to this track something of a chore.<br /><br />\\"The Making of a Classic\\" is a retrospective featurette. Shepherd wanted Hepburn to play Holly but Paramount didn't think she was right for the part. Cast members, friends and family gush about Hepburn. Blake Edwards recounts some decent anecdotes about filming and admits that he didn't want Peppard to play Paul but grew to appreciate him.<br /><br />\\"It's so Audrey! A Style Icon\\" examines Hepburn's look in the movie. She was not considered a classic beauty but was very beautiful. She flew against the voluptuous Jayne Mansfield type popular in the 1950s.<br /><br />\\"Brilliance in a Blue Box\\" takes a look at the famous jewelry store Tiffany's. They talk about the famous Tiffany Canary diamond - the largest at the time - and how Hepburn was one of the select few that ever got the chance to wear it. Some of the store's history is covered but this feels suspiciously like a promo for the store.<br /><br />\\"Audrey's Letter to Tiffany's.\\" Hepburn was a huge admirer of the store and wrote a preface for the 50th Anniversary book in 1987. This letter is read by one of the store's representatives.<br /><br />Finally, there is the original theatrical trailer.examines Hepburn's look in the movie.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|If you played the final fantasy 7 game and feel in love with the well thought out plot, endless love story, and triumph of good over evil, then this is the movie of the century for you.  this movie picks up two years after the game ends with cloud running a delivery company.  you see all the old characters eventually including a surpirse shinra person.  the geostigmata is still a major problem because it seems that Sephiroth was not the only one feigning for the \\"reunion.\\"  this movie take you through and hour and 40 mins of pure bliss while it explores the currect problems of Cloud's world and the past from Final Fantasy 7.  the fight scenes are spectacular and they allow you to see what you were doing all those time you had someone attack with their weapon.  if you were nostaglic when you ended the game and while playing, all the nostaglia will come back.  this is a must have for anyone who played the game and is looking to see what the ending of the game really lead to.
0740748475|5.0|I think Calvin and Hobbes is one of the best comic strips ever written, and this collection is the best compilation of strips I've ever seen. It's almost complete (it contains every strip, but some of the art from the paperback collections is missing) and it's beautifully bound. It's hard-covered but not really hard-bound; I wish the pages had been sewn in rather than glued. But it appears to be sturdy enough to last for decades, and if it ever starts falling apart (probably well after I'm dead), some of the plates are pretty enough for my kids to frame. The volumes are heavy; this is for reading on a table or when you're well settled in a comfortable chair.
0800141660|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, not to mention, books.  Emma Thompson does a terrific job of keeping to the original story by Jane Austin.  Each character is very well developed and the cast couldn't be better.  Love it.

B00005MP58|5.0|This mini-series is one of the best I've seen in acting, performance, music and scenery and the best version of Pride & Prejudice available.  It is well done from start to finish and every minute of the 6 hours is necessary to tell the whole story.  I recently saw the 2006 big screen version with Keira Knightley and while it was good and she did a fine job acting, the movie was very rushed.  They jammed far too much material into the 3 hours but left out parts that needed to story to flow better.  I like the A & E version much, much better and it still has fine acting and captures the essence of the book and also captures that time period in England extremely well.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Being first generation in an Asian American family, my sisters and i can really relate to this movie.  We watch it about once a year with our mom (who is Chinese) and we always laugh and cry.  My favorite part is the scene with Waverly bringing home her boyfriend to meet the family and how the cultures clash.  We made our boyfriends (who are all white) watch that scene especially so they know how to act.  The part that always brings the most tears is the scene with June and her mom after the crab leg supper.  Very typical of Asian American families espcially if you are the first born of immigrants.  Recommended for all mothers and daughters to watch.

B000E8NRR6|5.0|Maybe I can shed a little bit of light on the situation regarding the \\"5.1 surround sound\\" of this DVD edition.  Despite the fact that on the cover of the DVD it says \\"5.1 surround sound\\" and inside the case it says \\"this disc plays on all DVD players,\\" these statements can be a bit misleading for those not familiar with DVD-Audio (DVD-A) systems.   <br /> <br />A DVD-A system is an enhanced DVD player that has 6 separate channels of sound output going into a receiver (that has six channel capability), each output channel typically has its own cable from the DVD-A player into the receiver.  The receiver then outputs the signal, usually identified as a \\"six channel output,\\" to the speaker system.   <br /> <br />Your standard DVD player (a DVD-V) does not have this capability.  Even if you are able to output your DVD movies to a 5.1 system using some sort of optic connection, this is not the same as DVD-A system which needs those 6 separate channels. Yes, a DVD-V system will play the disc, but you will not hear the benefit of the 5.1 surround sound - in fact I think the sound heard on a DVD-V system with this album is inferior to that heard using the CD version on a standard CD player. <br /> <br />And as one of the other reviewers stated, there is really not a lot of video images associated with this disc (no MTV-type clips, no lyrics, no listing of musicians, etc.)  So if you do not have a DVD-A system you are wasting your money buying this DVD, stick to the CD only. <br /> <br />HOWEVER, if you do have DVD-A, the sound is fabulous!  Steely Dan was the reason I installed a DVD-A system initially and they never let me down.
B000002UC5|4.0|Paul McCartney's first solo recording signified his break from the Beatles without the stark, bitter tone that punctuated John Lennon's &#34;Plastic Ono Band.&#34; The album's best songs — &#34;That Would Be Something,&#34; &#34;Every Night,&#34; &#34;Junk&#34; and the classic &#34;Maybe I'm Amazed&#34; — remain highlights in the McCartney catalogue. In retrospect, this one-man-band approach holds up better than most of Sir Paul's solo work.
1400032717|4.0|This novel, written in first person, takes the reader into the mind and thoughts of a 15 year old autistic child, raised by a  dysfunctional family in London.  The naive, bizarre, but insightful reasoning of the child is perfectly presented.  One is allowed to share thoughts, feelings and life goals that might never be shared with another person. The author, who has worked with autistic children, obviously has been very successful in presenting a sympathetic, empathetic and odyssey-like adventure.  A must-read for friends and family of an autistic child.

0060012358|5.0|The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents is a great book. There's no denying it. It has a great plot, great characters, and hilarious humor. It has quick and witty jokes and the characters are very beliveable. If you are looking for an original book, this is definitely your best bet. <br /> <br />The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodentsis about a criminal genius talking cat named Maurice and his army of talking rats. There is also a stupid looking kid called Keith and a girl names Malicia who thinks that life is a big story. The Amazing Maurice is working a con where he sends in the rats to plauge the town, then the stupid looking kid comes to the town as a rat piper and the educated rats follow him out of town, conning the towns out of their money. However, when they reach the town of Bad Blintz, a mysterious evil causes problems at every turn. In Bad Blintz, the resident rats have been eating all the food, but when the talking rats show up, they find no rats. There are two sinister but idiotic rat catchers and a strange mysterious voice that controls people. Meanwhile, the rats are struggling to understand exactly how their new minds work. <br /> <br />This book is one of the funniest books I have ever read. The characters' personalitys bounce off each other endlessly, creating many small conflicts that are really funny to read. Even the names in this book are funny. There are rats named Darktan, Hamnpork...and Dangereous Beans. <br /> <br />All in all, I would recomend this book to anyone. It is a great book, and it won the Carnegie Book award for children's literature. The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents should be read by anybody looking for a good book.
B00028HBKM|3.0|This is a disturbing, yet beautifully filmed, brutal, hard-to-watch, makes you think movie, and in a way has it's place as a \\"must see.\\" However, the scourging of Christ here is WAY over the top. I mean he would be dead by the time he started carrying the cross in this movie. He literally has no skin by the time they make him carry his burden and they keep whipping him. By the time they flip him over while he's nailed and raise him up, he'd be a corpse. I know he's the son of God, and it's a modern depiction of the passion play made popular in the middle ages, and the weight of our sins is represented symbollically in the amount of pain portrayed, but it's misleading to say it's historically accurate in this aspect. Yeah cruxifiction was brutal, but this is ridiculous. Gibson needs some mental help.    Besides the gratuitous bloodbath, I think the main thing that keeps this from being a classic is Gibson, after 2 hours of horrifying torture, gives about 15 seconds portraying the most important part of the story: The Resurrection. Yes, Christ died terribly for all of our sins but it's when he RISES from this death that finally justifies his claim as \\"Son of God.\\" Check out the end of \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" to see how powerful the Resurrection can be potrayed, then imagine how great it could've been with this movie's special FX and mood. I just think it would've given more hope at the end, which is the point of the \\"story\\". We watch this man graphically die, now show us the rest of it and how he's MORE than a man. Gibson shows him getting up and running away, but that's it. No ascension into heaven and it kind of loses the spirituality of the conclusion of Christ's time on earth. His greatest moment wasn't the cruxifiction, it was his rebirth and this movie misses the point.  Now if only Caviezal and Gibson would do a prequal, only without the over the top, gratuitous B-horror movie violence that makes \\"Braveheart\\" look like a G-rated kiddie flick.
0385336942|2.0|Cloud Atlast is the story of a WWII Bomb Disposal agent who is sent to Alaska in the wake of Japanese hot air balloon-bombs making their way across the Atlantic at the end of the war.  While there he falls in love with a native Alaskan fortune teller and has various underming experiences with his sadistic commanding officer.  The story is told in a series of flashbacks that mostly deal with his developing psuedo-feelings for the girl, and his increasingly intense experiences looking for these bombs and dealing with his seargant. <br /> <br />The book is a misfire because it is meant to be a character piece where the different elements, (i.e. the absurdity of war, unexpressed love, beautifull nature etc.) add up to an greater and complete whole.  Unfortunately I felt the book fell flat and never reached its potential.  The main character was well developed but turned out to be boring, and uninspired.  His submissiveness and naitivity got old after awhile as I never felt that he really grew from his experiences.  Also his narritive was uneven as his penchant for melodrama resulted in way too many \\"life changing\\" experiences which in effect just diluted the important moments towards the end of the book.  In addition the atmosphere of the book didn't work for me as I never felt any emotional ties to any of the characters. <br /> <br />There are some scenes where the book really works and is laugh out loud funny.  These are mostly Catch 22 meets Apocalypse Now types of encounters and usually involve the mail character and his insane/absurd seargent.  <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  In the end this book was a let down and frequently boring.  I never emotionally connected with the characters and I really can't recommend it.
B00005JOE8|4.0|I thought V for Vendetta was a really good movie, and it now the best of Alan Moore's Work that has now been brought to the big screen.  Yet, I wonder why disowned his name from the credits of the movie. Perhaps it's because the original graphic novel from which the movie was based upon was not only about the message that the masked hero delivered but it was also a little bit more about exploring what V (the character himself) was really all about.  Because by reading the graphic novel and then seeing the movie there were obivous chages made to the original story, but you can tell that the movie didn't spend as much time on the V character like the graphic novel did but it was more about the message that V delivered.  It would be very interesting to hear Alan Moore talk about his reason for not being involved in the movie. Because I thought the movie still had alot that maybe he could still have been pround about.

Donald has once again proven that he is still the musical genius he always was. <br /> <br />I would personally beg him not to wait another 13 years before putting out another project.

There wasn't a dull moment in the film and the characters were involving and interesting.  Nathan Fillion was great - those who liked the Joss Wheedon \\"Firefly\\" series will love this.  It is much, much better.  The only criticism I had was that I remembered some of the same quips from Firefly and this annoyed me somewhat.  I have watched it x 3 already and will undoubtedly see it many more times before I'm done.
B000BISBDY|4.0|I admit that The Legend is not the complete Johnny Cash.  I think you'd have to buy one of his boxed sets to get a good appreciation of his music.  However, with all the publicity the movie Walk The Line(which stars Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny) has generated, I think you'd be wise to pick up The Legend.  This record has some great highlights from Johnny's nearly half a century of making music.<br /><br />The Legend features a lot of great tracks from the '50s and '60s.  \\"Cry Cry Cry\\", \\"Get Rhythm\\", \\"I Walk The Line\\", \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", and \\"Big River\\" all feature the booming guitar licks that Johnny made famous.  Other highlights include the blistering \\"Ring Of Fire\\" and the bouncy \\"Jackson\\"(Johnny's duet with his wife, June Carter Cash).  Johnny showed his sense of humor on \\"A Boy Named Sue\\"(from his live San Quentin record), which was written by his buddy Shel Silverstein.  Johnny continued to have hits in the '70s, including his signature song, \\"Man In Black\\"; the reflective song \\"Sunday Morning Coming Down\\", written by Kris Kristofferson, another one of his buddies; and \\"One Piece At A Time\\", another humorous song.  Though Johnny practically dropped off the charts in the '80s, he had success when he, Kristofferson, and their pals Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson toured and recorded together as The Highwaymen.  \\"Highwayman\\", which became a big hit for the quartet, is a classic song featuring some great vocals and an awesome musical background.<br /><br />Somewhat surprisingly, I am most impressed with Johnny's American Recordings songs from the late '90s and the early part of this decade.  Producer Rick Rubin gave Johnny free rein to do whatever he wanted, and the results are great.  The recent songs which are on here include Johnny's reworkings of his old songs(\\"Delia's Gone\\", \\"I've Been Everywhere\\", and \\"Give My Love To Rose\\"); a couple of contemporary rock anthems(\\"The Wanderer\\", featuring U2's Bono, and \\"Rusty Cage\\", which has some awesome guitar work); and the apocalyptic anthem \\"The Man Comes Around\\".  The song that really aces the record, though, is \\"Hurt\\", written by the Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor.  When Johnny sings, \\"I hurt myself today/To see if I still feel\\", one gets the feeling that Johnny is singing about his own substance addiction.  Though Johnny regularly spoke publicly about his religious faith, he battled alcohol and pill problems off and on until his death.<br /><br />As with any compilation, The Legend isn't perfect.  Though it's impossible to capture the career of a legendary performer in one disc, a couple of my Johnny Cash favorites are missing here.  The Western ballad \\"Ghost Riders In The Sky\\", along with another Highwaymen song, \\"Desperados Waiting For A Train\\", are among the best songs Johnny came out with, and yet this record doesn't include them.

0140177396|4.0|<br />The book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is one dealing with many themes and elements of the story. The action of the novel takes place on or near a ranch in the Salinas Valley of California, south of San Francisco. The time period is never stated, but it is probably during the early 1930s, the time of the Depression. The nomadic wandering, poverty, and despair that George and Lennie embody are all indicative of that time. The dominant mood of the story is that of expectation which is developed through the dreams of the major characters. There are also other moods evoked through the actions of the characters reflecting sorrow, pity, and brutality. The novel ends on a tragic note. The tone at the end is definitely one of depression and frustration. Loneliness is a key element in this story. Many of the characters admit to suffering from profound loneliness. George sets the tone for these confessions early in the novel when he reminds Lennie that the life of a ranch-hand is among the loneliest of lives deep .The fact that they admit to complete strangers their fear of being cast off shows their desperation. In a world without friends to confide in, strangers will have to do. Each of these characters searches for a friend, someone to help them measure the world, as Crooks says. In the end, however, companionship of his kind seems unreachable. For George, the hope of such camaraderie dies with Lennie, and true to his original inference, he will go through life alone. The characters are made helpless by their isolation, and yet, even at their weakest, they seek to ruin those who are even weaker. The novel suggests that the most visible kind of strength, that used to oppress others, is itself born of weakness. The title of the novel, Of Mice and Men, is a reference to Robert Burns' poem entitled `To a Mouse\\". This book is a classic work of literature and one I would recommend to all.  <br />
0790729652|4.0|The movie is good. Given up to 1989, the only other comic book movie that was 'ok' would of been Superman. Even that though, does not come close to Batman. However, in the day and age of Batman Begins, X-Men, Sin City, etc. There are certain flaws that appear here that would only grow bigger in the future.<br /><br />  Batman Begins focuses on Batman, where in this movie Jack Nicholson takes the show. Almost to the point where the movie might of needed to be called \\"Joker.\\"<br /><br />  The movie certainly is dark, but more of a noir dark than todays batman. This is not the vision of the post year one batman, but rather, the batman Bob Kane and Bill Finger had made.<br /><br />If your a die hard fan of the Adam West show, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />  The scenery is excellent, probably the best part of the film. There was some 1940's elements in it, but other more modern as well, so this isn't a time piece. it's a alternate universe almost. The city of Gotham is its own, which really gives it life.<br /><br />  The comic book fanatics will complains about the change of story in some areas. Here is a list of usual complaints. (1: Joker did not kill Batmans parents. 2: Wheres red hood? 3: Alfred seems to easily let Vicky Vale in the cave 4: She doesn't look to surprised to be in there 5: Joker is supposed to be nameless. 6: You do not kill the joker.) The list goes on.<br /><br />  You have to take the movie how it is, Tim Burton and warner did not make it just part of the comics but wanted it to stand on it's own, so it should be viewed with that state of mind. I do not think anything crucial to the actual basis of the psychology of batman was taken away. Which was the most important thing, it was kept the same to the comics.

0887307280|4.0|I had avoided reading The E-Myth for some time, even though I was given a copy of it and even though many people recommended it to me.  My reluctance was twofold:  firstly, as a small-business owner myself, I was afraid of learning that I was doing everything wrong (I'm glad to say I'm not!); secondly, I expected it to be another dry-as-dust how-to business book (it isn't!).<br /><br />Gerber's book is right on target, and I have already recommended it to friends who are poised on exactly the point in their own business that Gerber describes.  The book is entertaining, easily readable, and makes very effective use of story-telling to illustrate its points.  In fact, I can see a danger that some people might miss some of the points he makes simply because it is so entertaining.<br /><br />So why didn't I give it five stars instead of four?  Very simple:  As a coach, I operate a service-oriented business.  Gerber focuses his principles and illustrations around retail businesses.  Of course, most of his principles are easily transferrable, but I would have preferred to see some comments about service businesses as being distinct from retail.<br /><br />In any event, regardless of whether you are an entrepreneur currently (in a retail or service business!), or you think you might someday want to be an entrepreneur, or you work for a small business and want to understand more - or if you're interested in the workings of business - I highly recommend this book as thought-provoking and right on target in its suggestions.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|COADF is just a perfect pop dance cd. It's a type of music that keeps you moving and feeling young. It's fun, energetic and unpretentious. Madonna really did a great job. I enjoy every song except maybe How High, which is still very okay when compared to mainstream music out there. I encourage you all to try this Madonna album.
B0000669JL|5.0|Time magazine may have listed Marley's 1977 album, Exodus, as the most influential album ever, but Legend is the top-selling reggae album in history. This is simply a phenomenal record that even non-reggae fans will enjoy. In many ways a greatest hits collection, Legend features Marley's most memorable songs including \\"One Love,\\" \\"I Shot the Sherrif,\\" \\"Buffalo Soldiers,\\" and \\"No Woman No Cry.\\"  <br /> <br />Bob Marley's musical talent and the social commentary of his lyrics made him an international superstar. Unfortunately, he was taken from the world before his time (much like Lennon, Hendrix, and Valens). It's a sad testiment of the times that artists today care solely about the bottom line (money) rather than using music as a medium for spread of ideas and philosophy. Marley was a rare commodity. <br /> <br />This is by far Bob Marley's best album. You will listen to it over and over. This record belongs in a time capsule to preserve for future generations.
B000BKDOB6|5.0|no argument here...amazing double disc...
0553278223|5.0|First off, I need way more than five measley stars!<br /><br />This is, hands down, one of my favorite books of all time & probably one of the greatest books ever written!  I say that without a trace of guilt.  Ray Bradbury is God!  I have read The Martian Chronicles no less than twenty times and I'm sure I'll read it at least that many more times before I'm through with it.  One of the true masterworks not only of Science Fiction, but of literature in general.  Bradbury is the unofficial spokesperson for the human race here.  Clever and intriguing, with more than a few twists ala The Twilight Zone (which makes sense since he used to write for TZ with his buddies Rod Serling and Charles Beaumont).  More of a collection of short stories than it is an actual novel, The Martian Chronicles asks and answers and comments on so many issues from the destruction of the environment to the rape and pillaging of new frontiers to social and racial tensions.  Free-thinking?  Is that anarchy?  Bradbury asks the questions and gives us his version of the answers.  Usher II is one of my favorite bright spots.  This is tongue-in-cheek Bradbury at full-throttle.  One of those \\"boring\\" books you had to read in High School, The Martian Chronicles was one of the first books that I had to read, that I did read, and that I actually enjoyed.  After that the full spectrum of Bradbury's work became available to me and I couldn't stop until it was all devoured.  Something Wicked This Way Comes, Dandelion Wine, Fareheit 451, The Illustrated Man, R Is For Rocket, S Is For Space... Like I said before, Bradbury is God and The Martian Chronicles is his crowning achievement.  Get your hands on it one way or another.  Lie, Cheat, steal,sell your immortal soul, whatever it takes.  The Martian Chronicles is a masterpiece!<br /><br />Dig it!
B000002KHB|5.0|Machine Head is an essential album. It started the Deep Purple \\"mania\\" here in the States, and by 1973 and '74 they were the biggest selling act in America, and without being a sellout! That's hard to do.<br /><br />Now here's a little background; Led Zeppelin IV, Black Sabbath's Paranoid, and Deep Purple's Machine Head stand as that \\"Holy Trinity\\" of Hard Rock we so often hear about. These albums provided the blueprint for virtually every metal band coming out of the 70`s. Though the least renowned of the big three, Machine Head contains the \\"Beethoven's 5th (da, da, da, daaaaaaa) of all guitar riffs, Smoke on the Water, a song that needs no introduction. The album also features the classic opener, Highway Star, which symbolizes all of Deep Purple's strengths and flexibilities, while showing off the finest soloing duel ever, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and keyboardist Jon Lord. Also, singer Ian Gillan (simply the finest singer of his generation), who blasts out with astonishing authority, range and power all the way through this album. Gillan lets the band take over on the largely instrumental Lazy, which would evolve into an incredible live jam on the Made In Japan disc. The unhurried shuffle feel of Maybe I'm a Leo shows that even the \\"filler\\" is great. Pictures of Home and Never Before remain indispensable, displaying the group at their melodic best. Another fabulous Blackmore riff propels the stunning Space Truckin', a fitting closer to one of the essential Hard Rock albums of all time.<br /><br />Enjoy a milestone album.
B000E97HIA|3.0|I'm a huge Prince fan but I'm not a big fan of his new release.  While the songwriting is very good for the most part, the music sounds pretty flat and repetitive.  The standout tracks on this album are the slow jams and or course Black Sweat. <br /> <br />No offense to those who gave this album four or five stars but, there is no way that this album is up to par with 1999, Purple Rain, Sign o the Times, the Gold Experience, or even the Black Album (which are four and five star albums of top quality).   the same funk, rock, and soul formula he'd been thriving on for so many years is starting to sound dull and empty (since he  did it so many times!). His style of music hasn't changed all that much from the early 90's and now it sounds like he completely ran out of things to offer creatively. <br /> <br />An artist as creatively gifted as Prince can do better than this. I feel he need to revamp his sound and find a new sense of inspiration like he constantly did in the 80's with the Revolution, and at the dawn of 90's with the New Power Generation. <br /> <br />This is an utterly faceless addition in his catalog. <br /> <br />
B000E8QVWY|4.0|I saw Walk the Line in the theater on Thanksgiving Day. Although I am not a country music fan, I have always had a certain amount of respect for Johnny Cash because he was his own man, a true original, and this persona came across in his songs. This element comes through nicely in Walk the Line. <br /> <br />Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance in the role of Cash, even getting the accent right. Reese Witherspoon, in the role of June Carter, also gives an electrifying performance. The two are dynamite together on the screen. <br /> <br />Most of the film focuses on Cash's musical career from its beginnings in 1955 to his concert at Folsom State Prison in 1969. As other reviewers have pointed out, we are only given a very short account of Johnny's childhood and teenage years - but from what we are presented with, Cash had to struggle and scrap for everything he earned.  <br /> <br />What I found most interested about Walk the Line is that it does not attempt to glorify, romanticize, or heroify Johnny Cash in any way. Instead, the director presents with all aspects of the country music legend's life: the good, the bad, and the ugly. \\"The man in black\\" was a dedicated musician and songwriter, and was totally loyal to his fans...but his musical career encompassed so much of his life that his marriage suffered, and he eventually turned to alcohol and drugs to cope with mounting pressure. <br /> <br />The concert scenes with Phoenix and Witherspoon on stage will make you crank your volume to the max. Personally, I think Phoenix deserved Best Actor over George Clooney at this year's Oscars for his performance in this movie. I actually walked away with a greater appreciation for country-western music and a newfound respect for Johnny Cash's musical legacy after watching Walk the Line.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never watched Firefly when it was on originally, but after I saw Serenity, I started surfing looking for more about the characters. I was excited about finding the series on DVD and after buying it I haven't stopped watching it. The concept is great (not to mention yummy nathan fillion and adam baldwin) and the dialogue is classic JW series. I absolutely love this series and I am in mourning that there are no more.
B00005JO9J|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  You can really connect with the characters.  Would highly recommend.

It sounds as if this album was recorded in the 21st century. Bravo Roger Glover!<br /><br />Enjoy a milestone album, twice!!!
B000E97HIA|5.0|You can't hold up Prince to other musical artists since his sound is unique and always has been.  The only comparisions you can make are to other Prince albums, and that is daunting considering the wide range of his output over the last three decades - each album has a distinct feel.  The faithful fans should find his latest 3121 satisfying, and new recruits will recognize a more solid pop experiment in the MUSICOLOGY vein rather than something too outside the pop world (like RAINBOW CHILDREN or NEWS).<br /><br />\\"Blacksweat\\" and \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" have been the two singles so far, both wildly different from each other - one a funky synth workout, the other a beautiful ballad with the strings of Mary Fisher (who's been around since PARADE).  And yet most of the album has a more harder edges rock meets funk feel than those two tracks would have you believe.<br /><br />3121 is a \\"Camille\\" inspired invitation to the rest of the album with distorted vocals over a live drum beat.  LOLITA is a Spanish influenced rocker with a peppy synth line and cool syncopation.  INCENSE AND CANDLES is a unique almost ballad delievered as a duet and half-rapped.  LOVE returns us to the rock meets funk section, and it has a unique bounce that will make it awesome through a loud set of speakers.  It has a great message too.  SATISFIED is a slow bedroom jam complete with organ and wah-wah guitars along with horns.  FURY was heard on Saturday Night Live, and again we have a rock funk song with a Hendrix style guitar weaving in and out.  THE WORD is his religious shout-out which reminds me of a more forward version of \\"Thunder\\".  BEAUTIFUL, LOVED, AND BLESSED is a great uptempo ballad with Tamara.  THE DANCE is a dramatic piano tango mixed with great horns - it's a jazzy cool vibe song.  GET ON THE BOAT is a Jame Brown influenced rave up with full horns led by Maceo Parker, and tympanny drums.  Great way to close the whole joint out on a high note.<br /><br />Very solid CD with a lot more guitars than usual, and more layered jams that all seem jazz influenced.  He's still growing as a musician, and this is a great Prince album that ranks up their easily with 2004's MUSICOLOGY.  Should be great in the car or at a party.  Also awesome for workouts with the iPod.  The best endorsement is it sounds like PRINCE.  Which means it's recognizable, but still dangerously new material that evolves with the man.

0060574216|5.0|Men Are From Mars, Women are from Venus by John Gray PHD is a very good book that keeps your relationship with your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfiend, fresh. I really liked how the book repeated itself, and inbetween paragraphs, had a small sentance that was important to the last paragraph. It really helped me to remember what I had just read, and to go and talk to my boyfriend about it. Every chapter is very thorough, and expresses each idea with examples from other couples John Gray has talked to in his seminars. Also, this book really helps when wanting to keep the argument level down in a relationship. Knowing how to communicate in a relationship, and knowing the differences between men and women are key ways to strengthen your relationship, body, mind, and spirit. I defintely loved this book. I will even go to it if I need some extra guidance.
B000063DFN|5.0|Powerslave (1984.), Iron Maiden's fifth studio album<br /><br />By the mid-1980's, Iron Maiden was one of the top metal bands out there and this was further seen in their great fan following. If being on top of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal scene at the start of the 1980's, with albums such as their self-titled debut and follow up 'Killers' was not enough, the band then made history with the seminal metal classic, 'Number Of The Beast' and then followed it up with the even better (in my opinion) 'Piece Of Mind'. The question was, could this band keep on producing such awesome heavy metal. After a long tour, the band went back to the studio and produced the 'Powerslave' album; their longest work at that point. This album has gone on to be a firm favourite amongst a number of fans but often languishes in the shadow of it's two predecessors. However, is this a fair reflection on the album?<br /><br />'Powerslave' is in many ways, the last of the straight up metal albums for Iron Maiden in the 1980's, as later releases would explore the bands more progressive side. However for me, this album represents the peak of the band's powers. 'Powerslave' is a monster of an album, featuring blisteringly heavy riffs and consitently great tunes. Also though, more so than previous releases, the album explores more longer and epic songs. In many ways, this is where the album succeeds as these songs are able to keep the listener interested throughout, with plenty of captivating sequences. This is chiefly demonstrated with the title track and the 13 minute epic 'Rime Of The Ancient Mariner', showing the culmination of the band's songwriting ability. The album also features two of the band's greatest singles in 'Ace's High' and 'Two Minutes To Midnight'. Guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray are in blistering form throughout the album, jamming out diverse and varied metal riffs and plenty of great solos, most notably in the 'Powerslave' song. Theres great drumming from Nicko McBrain and Steve Harris shows yet again how well the bass can be played (you could almost describe him as the 3rd guitarist in the band - his bass lines are that impressively dominant in the songs). Bruce Dickenson is well... Bruce Dickenson, vocals legendary as usual.<br /><br />Not too long ago, the Iron Maiden catalogue got totally remastered and improved. Hence the 1998 remasters are the way to go. The remaster job is great and all of the songs shine through with no sound glitches but also the recent version features and excellent accompanying booklet. The CD itself also has an enchanced multimedia section and you can view video footage of the 'Aces High' and '2 Minutes To Midnight songs from your PC.<br /><br />The well known opening riff to 'Aces High' gives a classic start to the album. This opener then bursts into top form fast metal from the band. Another song with a World War II theme, which the band are quite fond of in their songs, this is a great start to the song, with the chorus especially the highlight. An even better follow up in '2 Minutes To Midnight'. This is one of the few 6 minute songs that really succeeds as a single. From start to finish, it is an entrancing song with great riffs, fluid bass lines and great vocals. The instrumental 'Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)' is next up. Like most instrumentals, this song is highly underrated. It's another song full of great guitar solos supplemted by a solid bass line. 'Flash Of The Blade', another highly underrated Maiden tune follows. Mellow and deep verse riffs set up a great song and are followed up by another great chorus line. 'Duellists' finishes the first half of the album. This song is mostly instrumental with occasional inspired vocal injections from Bruce Dickenson. The guitar riffs have a heavy but again mellow feel to them, however, it is a style that works very well in this song.<br /><br />'Back In The Village' opens up the second half of the album. Perhaps the work's weakest track, this song isstill no turkey. The song's racy chorus is awesome and the occasional linking guitar riffs are infectiously catchy. However, on this album, the greatest 2 tracks are saved till last. The 7 minute mini-epic 'Powerslave' is the first. The song incorporates Egyptian styled progressions (in tune to the album's cover) which work really well. Bruce Dickenson uses themes of Pharoahs and Gods in what is a great vocal performance on this track. Musically, the song has great chugging riffs and wailing choruses, plus a crazy explosive ending. However the best part of the song is the instrumental part, which has some legendary bass lines from Steve Harris coupled with some killer solos from Murray and Smith. Then, if things couldn't get any better, the 13 minute epic in 'Rime Of The Ancient Mariner'. Some have called this progressive styled song overindulgent (it's Maiden's longest ever song), however there is no doubt in my mind and many others that this is one of the jewels in the crown for the band. Based on a poem by Samuel Coleridge, this epic never loses interest, whether it is in the lengthy verse riffs, the quiet but atmospheric interlude (which features creaking boat sound effects) or during the great harmonised solo section, which is Iron Maiden in full out attack. All in all, an awesome finish to an awesome album.<br /><br />Many fans of Iron Maiden will say that the band's finest works were 'Number Of The Beast' or 'Piece Of Mind'. Both are excellent, classic efforts however I feel that this album tops them both, chiefly in terms of creativity and sheer power. 'Powerslave' is an album which never has a dull moment and represents the great band at their greatest height. 'Powerslave' is a must for any heavy metal fans collection, this is a perfect demonstration of how metal should be played. Don't miss out!<br /><br />MY RATING: 10/10; a classic that rises above the restis awesome and the occasional linking guitar riffs are infectiously catchy.

B0009FU0ZQ|2.0|I liked the premise and thought the movie started good.  It really captured the feel and vibe of a man starting over with his dog...and bottle.  Like a reviewer said, the pace slowed so much I became conscious of it...and that's bad news for a film, especially one on TV.  With commercials interrupting the pace, it worsened.   <br /> <br />Then there was plot holes too big to accept.  This could have been a good movie, but the script was weak and the writing too TV movie-like.  This proves a significant point...no matter how technology advances, it ALL start with writing.  Then you have to have the director to deliver the script.   <br /> <br />Selleck did his part.   <br /> <br />I was slightly embarrassed for him towards the end.  He deserves a new launch of success and finding that next Magnum character is his call.  His appeal just didn't cross over to film...too bad.  He made some decent flicks, but Selleck was made for TV.  He needs his Texas Walker Ranger...and there should be a great team working on this before he misses his last years of his prime.

B00005JOE8|5.0|Today I saw \\" V for Vendetta \\" and I was completely blown away.  I hardly know where to begin with this mastery of film making but where credit is due sometimes brevity isn't warranted.  The camera direction was near flawless and the editing sequence ( in terms of technicality ) was excellent too. I loved the development of each scene and how the movie flowed along. It really is like poetry in motion filled with fine acting and a most exciting and compelling plot!  The lighting was wonderful and the music really set the mood. This is by far the best movie I have seen in the last two years.  The script was so well written.  I will see this movie again. I think Hollywood has gained more respect from me whereas before seeing this movie I was beginning to think all good movies were no more. This movie was so entertaining as well.  Anyone who says this movie wasn't good certainly is either lying or feels offended by the political implications of this movie.  Please check out this movie because unlike so many other movies lately this one is well worth the price of admission.  Before anyone thinks I am not critical of movies and that I give 5 star reviews too most movies please view my other reviews and you will see that i am critical most of the time.
B000002MP2|5.0|Obviously these kid's reviews are totally, utterly useless considering that they probably 2 when Dookie actually came out, if alive at all. Green Day is, sad to say to all you Green Day haters, the most influential band since the end of Nirvana, and this is coming from a die-hard Van Halen fan. Almost every pop-rock band today, like Good Charlotte and Blink-182 would not exist if not for Green Day, and Green Day would not have been a factor at all had it not been for this record.     It was THE record that revolutionized and revitalized punk rock. At their core Green Day was simply punk rock, and Dookie opened the doors for bands to come along now. With grunge fading out after Kurt Cobain's death (only 63 days after the Dookie was released) the world needed something new to latch onto and it was the fresh punk sound of Green Day and Dookie.  Every song on this album is brillinat (with the exception of Tre Cool's wheezing in the last song), and some, like Bascet Case, When I COme Around and Longview are classics. While not as known, every song on the album is catchy, simple, memorable and lovable, as punk is meant to be played.     Dookie opened the doors, and gave pop-punk, pop-rock and punk-rock a place in the late 90's and so far this century. With the release of American Idiot, Green Day strayed away from their Punk roots (which they did before), and garnered the support of critics. Let it be known that since the end of Nirvana and the death of grunge (basically 1995-now) NO BAND, I repeat NO BAND, has been more influential to the landscape of today's music than Green Day, and it started in this classic, Dookie.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Not much more can be said.  Never in my many years have I seen a film as beautiful and touching as Brokeback Mountain.  And although Crash took the gold...Brokeback will always be remembered as one of the most incredible pieces of art to ever come out of Hollywood!  Crash I fear cannot say the same...
B000AP04L0|5.0|I really love this movie.  Its so funny but its very true.  I identify many of the characters out of my own life.  Great movie!  Fast delivery!
B0002FR07O|4.0|Porcupine Tree is a recent find for me. I started with the latest releases and immediately became a fan. As I work my way back I find the previous material intriguing as well, though for me not quite as good. Signify fits in this category for me. There are songs that definitely make the greatest hits list (Dark Matter).  Perhaps I will come to a greater appreciation of the rest on my mellow days.  Regardless, I have yet to find one of their CDs not worth purchasing.
B000E97HIA|5.0|This is one of the best albums from Prince, take my word for it!!! It is raw, funk oriented, with unbelievable drums, bass, synths, guitars, vocals, melodies... It is nothing like \\"Musicology\\". I thought \\"Musicology\\" was decent albeit too calm; this one will blow your mind with its originality and power. I did not expect it be that good, honestly. You can dance to it, you can think to it... It is stunning!!!
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie is great from so many angles. Johnny Depp is wonderful, to spite the small role he plays. The story is one you'll never forget!
B0008ENICU|4.0|This movie is a classic of old cinema.  What great names with Norma Shearer and a young Joan Crawford.  The great thing about this movie is that it really is \\"The Women\\".  You do not see a man at all in this movie, although it is what they talk about.  You have to love a movie that premieres in 1939 and is filled with talk of sex, divorce, affairs, cat fights, and comedy.  This movie is completely worth the time and is a testement to a great movie with a baudy topic, but doesn't have to be rated R to get the point across.
B000059ZLH|4.0|Scenes from a memory is my favorite Dt album, the dvd is also the best of the ones thay have released so far. The show covers the whole Scenes album with some sort of movie footage and an amazing choir for The Spirit Carries on. This deserves 5 stars except for the audio mix available, only stereo. The band commentary is also very interesting and funny.
0553804677|5.0|I've just finished reading my advance copy of The Lies of Locke Lamora, and Scott weaves an exciting and suspenseful tale.  I can't really describe how good it is without giving away plot points or twists; but suffice it to say, it's amazing.  I very much enjoyed my read, and even lost sleep working on \\"just one more chapter\\".  But hey, don't take my word for it; take George R. R. Martin's; his review is here on Amazon, as well as on the cover of the book (at least my copy).
B000BBOUU4|4.0|When I first heard that they were doing a remake I was totally shocked and worried. Gene Wilder did such a good job that I was reluctant to go see this one. But, as soon as I heard that Johnny Depp was playing Wonka and that Tim Burton was directing all my worries just dirfted away. What I like about this one is that it's not exactly the same as the original. After watching the other one a million times . . . I was expecting something different. The sets were real, people. No CGI there. The acting was hilarious and all the characters gave something different to the remake. But, however possible, in this one, Wonka slightly takes on a creepier tone. Gene wilder was playful, but in this one, Wonka almost has a glimmer of sadism in his eyes. Watch the Sqirrel scene, you'll see what I'm talking about. Anyhow, the misfortunes of the children were very funny and gave me back the memories from before. The only thing that I really didn't like were two very distinctive things:<br /><br />One, the oompa loompas were totally wrong. All of them looked depressed or just plain angry. Not like the orange-faced goof balls in the last one.<br /><br />Two, the songs were not as pleasing. They say that the songs were taken straight from the book. The whole movie, in fact is based soley on the book, give or take a few scenes, while the original was made with a genrally understanding of the book. But, all in all, the 1974 WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACOTRY still does better at the songs. That's my opinion. But the movie still is enjoyable.<br /><br />Final Verdict: The Shananigans are back.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0000AFX64|3.0|I watched this show as a kid when it came out and remember enjoying it quite a bit.  I bought the DVD in the bargain bin at my local shop and gave it a try just for the heck of it.  I wasn't expecting too much but figured it would be solid since the original series was rather well done for it's time. <br /> <br />It was really cool seeing some of the characters and ships that I remembered and the first half hour or so of the movie actually held up pretty well when compared to other films of the same genre.  The Cylons are cool villians, Starbuck, Apollo, and Boomer were great main military characters.  Commander Adama seemed to be a solid leader as well.  The sets and special effects, while not ground-breaking were fairly convincing...at first anyways.  So, the movie rolled on but as it did, this is where things got a little dicey. <br /> <br />I noticed that several spaceflight shots and explosions were used over and over again which was easy to see.  Large battles started to get lame as the same camera shots were used over and over stealing from the realism.  The launch sequences of the Galactica fighters also became monotonous after the ump-teenth showing of it.  A few of the space shots also looked terribly dated, but seeing it was made in the late 70's I was not going to hold it against them.  Overall it looked OK, but the repetitiveness of the battle scenes did wear on me after a while. <br /> <br />When the Galactica crew made it's way to the planet Carillon to refuel, regroup, and replan their strategy this is where some of the cheesiness began to rear it's ugly head.  The disco/casino set was about as dorky as possible.  It was like Saturday Night Fever in space.  Also, the bug-like Aliens on thet planet that were seceretly helping the Cylons were a little dumb looking.  Hey, they didn't know any better and it didn't really detract too much from the movie, but it did show just how dated and corny some the older shows do in fact look nowadays. <br /> <br />The story of BG is great with a lot of cool concepts.  You have deception, trust being broken, epic space battles, humanity fighting for survival, etc, etc.  The movie itself could have captured this more but the film did seem rushed at times. The final battle with the Cylon main ship was a little too easy for my tastes and the plan used would not have fooled anyone, IMO. <br /> <br />Still, this IS a classic and is certainly worth watching for the nostalgic value.  However, owning it is NOT neccessary in my opinion since seeing it once will be quite enough.   <br /> <br />So, it is recommended to WATCH but I don't see the need to buy it.
B000E97HIA|3.0|Prince returns with a decent follow-up to 2004's Musicology, 3121.  On the new album, Prince harkens back to the 80's synthesized sound of pops, crackles and squawks.  This is best showcased on the song \\"Lolita\\" which employs a stripped down sound built around a heavy electronic sound.  \\"Black Sweat\\" has a start and stop rhythm with a crackling synthesizer.  The ballads are the weak part of the album with only the sultry \\"Satisfied\\" really hitting the mark.  The best two tracks on the album are \\"Fury\\" and the album closer \\"Get On The Boat\\".  The former is a blistering rocker that recalls his 80's glory days and the latter is a full-out funk jam that features the great Maceo Parker and burns the cd the down at the close.  3121 has its moments and it is a tight collection of only twelve tracks (mercifully he has seemed to stop over bloating his albums with filler) that helps cement Prince's comeback.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|First time I saw it on TV I thought \\"Oh no,not another of these TV series.\\" <br />But after watching it a few times to actually say something about it,I was really surprised.Their language,their acting,everything is just great!Since that day I am really addicted to the \\"Gilmore Girls\\".They are amazing! <br /> <br />Something you really got to watch!!!Don't miss it!!!!!
B000AWYOGE|1.0|When I first picked up this dvd, I had high expectations. Who wouldn't? The review on the cover loudly proclaims: \\"Even Hicthcock Could Not have done Better.\\"<br /><br />That's a pretty bold statement when you think about it.<br /><br />I really tried to like this movie.<br /><br />And, on top of that, after watching it, some would say that it's similar to the Ring. What are you talking about? IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE RING ONLY IT HAS DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.<br /><br />Let's get all the cons about this movie out of the way first:<br /><br />1. 'Dark Water' is not a very original title for a movie of this magnitude.<br />2. All the characters seem bored or uninteresting.<br />3. There were dream sequences that didn't fully contribute to the plot but were more placed there for artistic style pruposes.<br />4. Half of the movie's Theatrical Trailer was an out right lie. A lot of scenes were not even there that got me so pumped up for the movie while watching the trailer. And that is no good at all.<br />5. The screams and shocks were not huge and loud enough.<br />6. Lastly, if you're going to say that Hitchcock couldn't do better, you'd have to really convince me.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. The drama was well-acted.<br />2. The premise was alright but not mind-bending. In fact, the theme has been done before. But you might like it.<br /><br />Final verdict: Dark Water doesn't scare people that easily.
B00005JO20|5.0|This is the best film in years! Way better compared to Steven Spilberg's War of the worlds! The special effects are truly amazing! Get this movie or your not a true Kong fan!
0060751967|4.0|I was skeptical about buying this book. I don't like romance I like horror action. This book was good. It took a lot of time to get started but once it got there it was great. It had aa great story line and I can't wait for the next book

B0000AOV85|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon had a profound impact upon me when I first listened to it 30+ years ago. It was clearly a musical masterpiece and to learn how it all came about was for me extremely interesting. Anyone at all interested in Floyd's musical genius owes it to themselves to spend an hour watching this documentary.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Rusell Davies reinvention of the British classic has been the broadcasting story of 2005. Put quite simply it is the biggest show on Tv in the Uk at the moment. I think that sometimes it is hard for people Stateside to grasp this. This is not a cult hit, one in 6 people in the Uk are watching this.  <br /> <br />This DVD set collects together all 13 episodes from the first series along with a good series of extras (although not as outstanding as we had all hoped) and shows off a dazzling array of inventive and intelligent telefantasy stories.  <br /> <br />Christopher Eccleston nails the Doctor completely and shows just what a good actor he is. Billie Piper is also superb as the companion Rose Tyler. But it is the writing where the series really scores. RTD and his team really show their love of the old show without missing the point that today's Tv market calls for a fast paced modern approach. <br /> <br />This is the show that has redifined TV in the UK, it can be watched and enjoyed by everyone from 1 - 100 and has already found its place at the top of the television tree.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I dont possess the album yet, but I've heard snippets. It sounds beautiful. Im not into deciding what was the best of Pink Floyd or what is to come. All I know is I adore and love the music. David  has done a fab job - thanks David - bravo!
0316172324|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's *Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking* is a fascinating and quick read, saturated with studies and statistics and stories about how our (subconscious) mind works. <br /> <br />Blink takes us into that paradoxical realm where quickness in judgment (\\"in the blink of an eye\\") can be amazingly accurate and we, at a conscious level, don't even know why. The opening story about the Getty museum ancient artifact hijacks your attention. You're caught in Gladwell's grip for the rest of the book. <br /> <br />I like books of this kind because they stretch our thinking and even reverse the settled results of popular conclusions and myths. You meet some unusual characters in the book like Paul Van Riper and John Gottman, Abbie Conant and Paul Ekman. (Each of these are tied to some amazing stories about our thinking processes.) <br /> <br />The chapter titled \\"Seven seconds in the Bronx\\" is worth the price of the book (or read it at your public library for free). It's this chapter which launched my imagination into the Bible's references to \\"the face,\\" whether human or God's. The Bronx story is about tragedy in space of 7 seconds. Yet, the last story of the chapter, about a human encounter in the space of perhaps 1.5 seconds, relieves the tension you feel. 'Nuff said. <br /> <br />Gladwell is also the author of *The Tipping Point.*
B00005JNQS|3.0|I find myself saying what I say about many films these days: I love the visuals, but the story is a bit pedestrian. <br /> <br />This highlights what is so great about Pixar movies. (Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, Toy Story.) \\"Robots\\" is literal and obvious all the time. Take the title: \\"Robots\\". It is literal. The story mainly consists of \\"robot jokes\\". Jokes just based on the fact that the characters are robots. Pixar would have made far less obvious jokes. And they would have made the characters much more interesting, not cardboard. Sorry, tin plate. <br /> <br />Finally, \\"Robots\\" signals all its messages in huge, shining letters. When the characters have a \\"touching\\" moment, their face lights up in close-up, and \\"uplifting\\" movie music plays. Pixar movies don't hit the audience over the head. <br /> <br />Maybe I'll finish the film yet, since the visuals are so wonderful, and it does have the occasional amusing moment. And then maybe I'll rewatch The Incredibles.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I, among others will tell you that this is Eminem's best. At this time he were at his prime. He was still hungry, angry, funny and creative when he recorded this. I didn't think things could get any better than The Slim Shady LP, but he really outdid himself on this one. It was almost to good to be true. Of course he was backed up by a great production team, but he really shines right here on this LP. He spits fire on every track, and his lyrical delivery is amazing. Eminem is a entertainer, that you either love or hate. It doesn't matter that this record became a commercial success, it's still a incredible outstanding record. <br /> <br />All the way from \\"Kill You\\" `till we reach \\"Criminal\\" is a music journey. He doesn't mind if he offend people, he tells you exactly his point of view. If `Em continued on this level later in his career, he would be labeled there in the top three, but I must admit that he has fallen off pretty bad, after The Eminem Show, it really hasn't been to much worth talking `bout. <br /> <br />Album highlights: Kill You, Stan, Who Knew, The Way I Am, The Real Slim Shady, Remember Me,  I'm Back, Marshall Mathers and Criminal. <br /> <br />Even though, this album is kind of played out, there no denying that it isn't a \\"modern classic\\". If you're new to rap and haven't picked it up yet, buy it together with The Slim Shady LP (almost as good) Too bad Eminem couldn't keep up at this high level longer, he were really amazing at this time.    <br />

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is one of those rare films that grabs and haunts you for weeks into months. It is not only about universal love but about homophobia and the closet.  Told in spare, elegant sequences. A rare achievement. AMPAS members (Academy Award members) should be ashamed that they took the safer way out by supporting a simplistic future TV show as Best Picture.
B000E97HIA|5.0|This album is excellent! Every song is a hit. It's a perfect blend to satisfy the new and old fans. The one sad thing is that when it's over...the cd leaves you yearning for more. But there is a solution for that.....REPEAT  and start the party again!! The title song is a sleazy funk groove that easily could have been on the Black Album, Black Sweat is the perfect companion to Kiss, and Fury easily shows you he in deed knows how to rock! If you want an album where you can just hit play and not worry about hitting skip then this it. It's a complete album and the songs blend together perfectly.  <br /> <br />Don't u wanna come? 3121

(that if you can say an illustrated book is gorgeous) <br />If you are a fan of the two characters then this is an absolute MUST!!!  Even not being a fan, you can get completey absorbed.   <br />I would also like to add that Amazon out done themselves totally! Shipping to the UK was in a record time of 4 days.  Amazing!!!
0684824906|5.0|Purchased this book after hearing the author on the radio discussing it. I read a great deal of history and there are a lot of Lincoln Books to chose from. Certainly, I knew the names and backgrounds of Lincoln's cabinet members before reading this, but the different perspective this book takes made the subject of Lincoln and the Civil War fresh and I enjoyed it completely. Recommed it to anyone interested in Lincoln, history or politics.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Dude, for all you people who dont like this album, just shut up. you must not be an iron maiden fan at all to not like this album. Sure, they arent 25 anymore, but damn this was an extrodinary effort. The opener the wickerman, is a maiden classic from start to end. This album contains a couple of songs that you may not hear about in some of the reviews, out of the silent planet, the nomad, ghosts of the navigator, and fallen angel. Those are standout tracks, not hinting that the rest arent good, but those are the ones you'll fall in love with. Sounds a tad different than their classic albums but hey their gettin up their on the age ladder. Great great album, welcome back bruce.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I judge Coldplay on Rush of Blood to the Head and although, I didn't expect something equally as good, I expected something similar in weight.  Obviosly different songs appeal to different people, and the songs on this album are not much less likeable than those on Rush of Blood...  but its the overall feel of the album that I have a beef with.  Besides 'Talk', evey other song on this album seems like a performance rather than sung from the heart, which Rush of Blood seemed to be doing during its every second. Yes the falsetto is there, it just doesn't display as much emotion as as Rush of Blood and that is my only knock on this album, otherwise, to everyone that knows the band will enjoy it.
B000002MP2|1.0|This 1929 album from Green Day is considered to be the first punk album. Many an old man was forced to stop their gramaphone after hearing the shocking filth emanating from the needle. It contains the hit singles \\"Lights\\", \\"Lice\\", \\"Headlice\\", \\"Headlights\\", and of course the classic \\"My Brother Does The Noises For The Talkies\\". Unfortunately the album has dated poorly. For example, while it may have seemed funny and edgy to title your album after a childish slang term for faeces in 1929, by, say 1994 even a mentally normal 8 year old would find it pathetic. So this one is best left on the shelf. <br /> <br />(P.S. I know the Pistols called their album \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\", but C'mon, THAT was funny)
B000E5N62U|5.0|Aside from all that can be said for the technical aspects of overall sound, lyrics, muscianship, and tonal quality of this album, there is one major thing that strikes me the most - this album feels like \\"The Dan\\" of the seventies that I fell in love with so many years ago. That cool, crisp, laid-back, self-assured, \\"I'm on top of the world regardless of the state of affairs\\" - kind of a-feeling. Nothing seems rushed or overstated.<br /><br />The last two Steely Dan albums have had the qualities of great muscianship and impressive orchestrations, however, something felt lacking and in the end the grand sentiment of self-possessed coolness was flattened by a feeling of \\"trying too hard.\\" Now I am at ease once again and I know that Donald can put together songs that are infectious - songs that I feel compelled to sing-a-long to - and ultimately songs that make me feel Oh-So-Hippishly-COOL!(If only I had a convertible).
B000002H2H|5.0|yeah this album kicks some major ass. Not a song on here isnt worth a listen and if you had enough time on your hands could listen to it all the way through and want to do it again. As of now this is my favorite metallica album as well as my favorite album.  <br /> <br />Fight Fire With Fire- wow, this song is fast. great chorus and guitars throughout 9/10 <br />Ride the Lightning- the opening riff is great, and the lyrics are superb 10/10 <br />For Whom the Bell Tolls- Not the most complicated song to play, but it just sounds great 10/10 <br />Fade To Black- if your feeling down or lonely, take a listen, best lyrics on the album 12/10 <br />Trapped Under Ice- James's voice really brings this song to life, like some of the riffs too 8.5/10 <br />Escape- I hear people talk bad about this song and i wonder why, great great chorus 10/10 <br />Creeping Death- Contains the best riff on the album, and some pretty cool lyrics 11/10 <br />The Call of Ktulu- its just another intstrumental, you can judge this one, but i like it 9/10 <br /> <br />to wrap things up, this is a stellar album and it will never be forgotten. if your a newcomer to metallica, you may want to start with this one
B000000WA4|2.0|Call me paranoid, but I think, I THINK, this band and album are just a tad pretentious.    And where the hell is that \\"Bat\\" Song?     Helpful Votes Prediction: Low
B000B8QEZG|5.0|What a smash this record has become. After owning it, I've become clear why. From Hung Up to Like It Or Not, the album proves to be a seamless slide yet each song still stands from one another. I'm particularly thrilled by the slide from Forbidden Love to Jump. Such a goosebump it gives me.
B000002H33|5.0|this album is not overrated nor is it in any sense an average or a good album, this is a kick ass album. Not a song on here that i wouldnt venture to guess could be a single (yeah even orion). so here we go <br /> <br />Battery- similar to fight fire with fire, starts out accoustic and gets fast in a hurry, and the lyrics just make this song a killer track 10/10 <br />Master of Puppets- two of the best solos ive ever heard, and the riff right before he says come crawling faster is one of the best ive heard, and james haunting voice brings this song to life 13/10 <br />The Thing That Should Not Be- this one has a rather cool riff in there, and james shreiks out the vocals and it gives you the chills 8.5/10 <br />Welcome Home (sanitarium)- this song is about a mental patient and his life, and this one really makes you think about how hard their life must be 10/10 <br />Disposeable Heroes- The intro riff has to be the best ive ever heard, and the lyrics are friggin sweet too 11/10 <br />Leper Messiah- this one is kind of funny actually, but besides that its got a nice little beat going 9/10 <br />orion- its an instrumental, cant say much 10/10 <br />damage inc.- nice way to go out, great song to end a great album 9/10 <br /> <br />james and kirk rank high up on the best guitar duos of all time, and lars and cliff (r.i.p.) keep a nice beat going throughout the entire album, nice job guys.
B000002N2P|1.0|Ah yes, this is the album that contains the classic single (and anarchist anthem) \\"Geek Stink Breath\\". I believe it was The Clash who originally penned that one. Or maybe it was the Dead Kennedys. No wait wasn't it the title of a book by that Nietzsche guy. Wow! \\"Geek Stink Breath\\" THEY REALLY PUNK ME OUT!
B000EHRVP6|3.0|This movie is somewhat of a step up from Eli Roth's first uber-terrible and sucky film \\"Cabin Fever\\".  \\"Hostel\\" is the story of three friends that go backpackpacking through Europe. They arrive in Amsterdam, where they encounter all the sex, and drugs that they can handle.  They learn of a hostel just outside of town. They are told that there are beautiful gilrs everywhere you look. And the girls are more than willing to do ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING you ask them to. The guys decide to check it out. Later on that night, the guys go to a club in town and hook up with these two girls that are there. Mad props to the casting director for casting these two girls. They were that hotness. Anyway, back to the review. After the guys meet the girls, things take a visceral, violent turn for the worst.  I had high hopes for this movie because one of my favorite directors, Quentin Tarantino, is one the producers of this movie. I was however, very disappointed. It wasn't even scary!  And the torture scenes weren't even all that bad!  I'll probably rent the DVD when it comes out so I can see the stuff I couldn't see at the theater.  This is DEFINITELY not a kid's film.  I saw this on opening night at the movies, and it was little kids in there.  I know, great parenting, right?
B000063DFN|5.0|god damn this album is good. I got this album from my parents for christmas and as soon as i could went and listened to it. This entire album, beginning to end, is superb; now its not ranked highest on my maiden list, but thats not saying much, considering maidens accomplishments. This is just metal, through and through, the kind of stuff you can't get out of your head, you know, the ones you sing in the shower and your car and hell i was singin some songs in church one day. if i had to pick the best three on the album it would have to be rime of the ancient mariner, powerslave, and aces high. not saying that  the other songs aren't good, but those stick out pretty good. Buy this album, especially of amazon, its like 10 bucks.
B00005JOE8|5.0|V for Vendetta is a story representing a future that could very well come true based on how events could play out.  In fact, the world of \\"Vendetta\\" is very much like what led to the creation of Nazism and Stalinism.  The government uses fear to control and cow its population.  The citizenry cower in their homes and scurry about their business, hoping to remain out of sight and out of trouble.  Isolationism, racism, homophobia, religious radicalism, state manipulation; they all tools used by a Supreme Chancellor bent on consolidating his power and ruling a futuristic U.K. through supreme oppression.      Opposing this oppression is a man, V, who represents another form of extremism.  Sometimes blurring the line between terrorist and freedom fighter, V fights against the state for the freedom of the people, yet is also consumed and driven by his own need for personal vengeance.  Having been a victim of a state-sponsored concentration camp and having been subjected to horrible experiments, V is now striking back against those who hurt him.  As a dark superhero, one wants to support V is his desire to brake the stranglehold of the oppressive Chancellor on the population, yet you are also conflicted by V's methods and motivations.  While V explains that what was done to him was 'monstrous', Evey goes further to state that V, himself, is now a monster.      Evey, herself, is a woman who's life has been torn apart by the government and initially finds herself afraid to stand up against the government's atrocities.  Through V, she both finds personal strength and enhanced wisdom over the need for radical action.  Her transformation is a painful one and again leads one to question V's methods and righteousness.      The last scenes, which I will not spoil, are very powerful.  The symbolism over the fall of government at the hands of the public and the need for citizens to question and act out against an oppressive government are very real ones.  The faceless masses are veryartfully turned into individuals as V brings down the establishment.      In general regards to the movie, the storyline moves along well.  There is action, but not as much as the previews would have you believe.  I found myself not even noticing as the ideas and controversial questions raised by the movie sucked me into the intriguing plot.  Natalie Portman as Evey, is exceptional, and though we do not see Hugo Weavings' face, his voice and body language bring a mysterious quality to V.  And as you'll hopefully appreciate at the end of the movie, V, himself becomes a symbol for all of us.    If you see this movie, think about how close our own society could come to becoming the world in V for Vendetta.  If we allow fear to control us and cause us to give up our own freedom for a perceived feeling of safety, we could find ourselves in a similar world of oppression, fear, and horror.
B000062YB1|5.0|holy crap, dead skin mask, a great song and a great story behind the lyrics, some murderer who killed women and made belts out of their nipples and masks out of their faces. Thats not the best song, but its good, id have to say seasons in the abyss is the best on here, skeletons of society starts out with a nice little riff, great chorus, war ensemble, expandable youth, also very nice tracks. im not going to write a long review on this album because one third of the nation has already done so, so just buy the album somewhere and get a listen in, and you'll see what i mean.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Wow, Madonna has released an album (long time coming) that is worthy of her name and style. Her maturity translates very well in this latest excellent effort. Terrific blend of experience and good-old-fashioned talent. Out of the park!
B000088E6D|5.0|I've heard a lot about Michael Buble on TV and in print...and finally got around to getting a CD. This is just wonderful. I grew up on old movies from my parent's generation and this definitely brings me back. His voice still makes you feel young, yet with a new twist. It's nice to hear music that makes you smile and you don't have to censor! GREAT CD!!!!! I will definitely be buying more!
B000002VCU|5.0|This is THE BEST album in my entire collection of hundreds of albums. It is perfection.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|i only heard his main cd and liked it, but when i heard the stripped cd i liked it even more. the stripped cd is what really makes this such a great compilation. there were songs on his original cd which i thought were ok, but after hearing the stripped version, he makes EVERY song sound good. love it!! i couldn't stop listening to it for days.
B00005JL78|5.0|This is very interesting action movie. Doesn't matter if you are a big fan of Tom Cruise or not, because after this movie you might start liking Tom. YOu really have to watch from beginning to the end and try to put yourself in the real 21 century, then you will understand it completely.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Having missed allot of the 1st season this collection has caught me up on the history of the characters. This is a must purchase for any Grey's Anatomy fan.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|With a lot of hits under her belt and the flop of her album \\"American Life\\", you can bet I was surprised to hear that Madonna would be releasing a new collection in 2005. <br /> <br />Having been a big fan of Madonna since her \\"American Pie\\" days (I was only 11 at the time), I decided to hear a sample of a few of her tracks online and was immediately convinced to buy it when it came out in New Zealand. She was on every radio station and we loved her. <br /> <br />\\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is the kind of musical experience that makes you sink into a rhythm of pure bliss at one minute, pump your heart rate up the next, but also subtly makes you reflect on how hard she has had to work to get here. You can hear her messages and reflections on her life throughout the album. <br /> <br />Personal favourites of mine are \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Issac\\". \\"Forbidden Love\\" has a beautiful, haunting beginning and it deserves a special mention. \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Sorry\\" are songs that need to be heard to be understood. \\"Issac\\" is one that made me wonder about why there was so much fuss surrounding it. The song is beautiful, with terrific instrumentals and the best lyrics Madonna has on the entire album. <br /> <br />I would reccomend this to anybody who enjoys a good boogie every now and then, or to those who just want to have a good time. For me, \\"Confessions\\" is never leaving my iPod.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Perhaps one cannot fully appreciate the universality of Lebowski until one of one's own children joins the fan club. This is the enviable position in which Wanda B. Red finds herself -- beneficiary of THE DUDE  -- as her teenage son self-identifies as a fan. <br /> <br />This is a film for the ages. I cannot claim to have seen it 100 times -- or to have attended conferences on the topic, as have other of the reviewers here. I have seen the film twice. But of course it is a premier cult film. It defines an era. Bunny Lebowski is so nubile, even I -- a post-menopausal (straight) Wanda -- am intrigued by her toes. <br /> <br />But more than that, I bow down to the talent of Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman -- and more than all of those the \\"Jesus\\"! -- John Turturro. <br /> <br />And the genius of Joel Coen. Honestly, it's wonderful to know that the Duder is out there taking it easy for all the rest of us. And I'm NOT kidding. Brilliant....
B0004Z33G4|1.0|First : Where are the special features were available in \\"Special edition\\" Release? <br />Second : There is nothing tempting on these Disks! Nothing. even deleted Scenes <br />Third : They say these movies are mastered in high definition. yes. bitrate is very high. but quality is nothing better than \\"Special edition\\" & they sacrificed DTS sound although all 3 Discs had enough remaining space for DTS! <br />Fourth : DVD Cases are defected. there is no way to remove disks from them without a fingerprint or scratch! Buy it and experience it! <br />Fifth : Print quality on DVDs are as good as Pakistanese bootleg DVDs!

B000002UTO|4.0|Nick Rhodes:  \\"I think from 1986, it was a different Duran Duran. We had a different attitude towards recording, and a different attitude towards life in general [because of the loss of original members, and loss of popularity].\\"<br /><br />Simon LeBon:  \\"We wanted to involve ourselves on the production side of things. I don't even think it was because we felt we had the ideas; we just felt that it was the right thing for us to do. We had to expand. We had to give ourselves a challenge.\\"<br /><br />Warren Cuccurullo:  \\"I think a lot of kind of soul searching was going on and `Big Thing' is a really good record. It's very experimental; there's a lot of interesting guitar on it and synthesizer stuff.\\"<br /><br />Simon LeBon:  \\"All She Wants Is, which is so out there, it was so current, and so ahead of its...of where we were coming from actually. It was the most experimental thing on the album.\\"<br /><br />John Taylor:  \\"'Big Thing' just turned into such a lumbering epic of a record that had such a black side to it that people just were not interested.\\"<br /><br />Warren Cuccurullo:  \\"The unity that we felt as a band at that point, when we decided that we should be writing together more, kind of kept us afloat...as long as we feel that we're doing something strong and we can make something as good as anything we've ever done, that's enough to keep us going.\\"
B000E1YVZU|3.0|Rent is of course the broadway musical thats been around for a long time because its the longest running musical on Broadway. Anthony Rapp (Dazed & Confused, Winder Passing) stars as Mark,  who documents the events all throughout the movie with his camera and who just got dumped by Maureen, played by Idina Menzel (Ask The Dust, Kissing Jessica Stein) who is now dating Joanne, played by Tracie Thoms (Everyone's Depressed, Porn N' Chicken). Adam Pascal (School of Rock, SLC Punk!) plays Roger who's a struggling musician who falls in love with stripper/drug junkie Mimi, played by Rosario Dawson (Sin City, Alexander). Jesse L. Martin (Law & Order, Restaurant) plays Collins who falls in love with Angel, played by Wilson Jermaine Heredio (Flawless, Johnny Was) and Taye Diggs (Equilirium, Way of the Gun) plays Benny the landlord of the building to kick everyone out. Fantastic shots of New York, streets, underground etc. etc. and the performances are great especially by Rapp, Heredio and Menzel...the protest rally scene with her was great. Dawson and Thoms werent in the regular broadway shows and they take the places of other people but they both do wonderful jobs here. The songs are great, sometimes cornish which is basically in the musical vein. \\"The Tango Maureen\\" sequence was one of the best and so was \\"La Vie Boheme\\". This one wont disappoing Rent fans. I've never seen Rent on Broadway but the movie was a winner all on its own. I just want to point this out...it seemed like they put Bon Jovi in the movie (Adam Pascal) heh heh. Also starring Daniel London (Minority Report, Patch Adams), Aaron Lohr (D 2 & D 3: The Mighty Ducks), Mackenzie Firgens (Nail Polish, Groove), Jason Foster (Voices Carry) and of course Sarah Silverman (Jesus Is Magic, Say It Isnt So). No Day But Today.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|The chemistry between the two leads was believable; gotta love actors who do their own singing; good storyline.  I really liked this movie. <br /> <br />Now, although I think Reese is an adorable actress, I do not think she deserved the Oscar and I'll tell you why.  I saw Transamerica at the theatre last weekend and was completely blown away by Felicity Huffman's performance.  I was absolutly mesmerized by her believable portrayal of a transexual.  Don't take my word, rent or buy this movie (if you haven't already seen it). <br /> <br />Back to \\"Walk the Line\\" - I saw Johnny Cash in a small venue about 15 years ago.  It was an amazing show and I felt honored to be in the audience.  Although it wasn't as good as the real thing, I think Joaquin did a very good job.  Hats off!
B000003CKH|5.0|Cake are, to be quite frank, a little bizaar! But very, very good!<br /><br />This album is typical of their sense of humour and musical talent!<br /><br />I can't remember when I first discovered them but I am glad I did and very glad I bought this album. Check out their fantastic version of \\"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps\\" and every other track.<br /><br />I just can't sing Cakes praises enough, buy this and you'll see what I mean!!
B00005JOE8|5.0|This movie was very political, It also was very scary since the government in this film is monitoring its citizens like our government has started to do. Also, the government in this film uses fear to take away the citizens freedoms slowly which our government is trying to do. Now everything that happens in the film is overblown but the same elements from both governments are there. I went to this movie with my father and after we left we were in a pretty deep political conversation, that does not happen very often if ever. All politics aside the film was entertaining and very well acted. All the characters were very rich deep and complex often having a positive side and a negative like real people. There was action in this movie but it will be disapointing for anybody who is going expecting a regular action movie. This was an excellent movie, I can honestly say I have never seen a movie like it. If you can stand the idea of this film challenging the definition of a terrorist than you should see the film. If you are the type of person who calls anyone with a different opinion \\"unpatriotic\\" than you probably will not like this film.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We love this game!!  It is a fun game for everyone from our 8 year old to Grandpa.  It is challenging and expands kids visual perception. Also a round of the game lasts 20-30\\", so you don't need a huge block of time to play.  I recommend this for everyone, and if you want to play with 2 people get the smaller version.
B00005JOE8|4.0|I just saw 'V For Vendetta' today in theatres, and it was absolutely awesome. An very engaging storyline, wonderful cinematography, great action, and a startling realism to real-life issues. It really has it all, and I'm sure whomever sees it will definitely be satisfied. Now, I've read a few things about people be offended that we're 'glorifying terrorism', but honestly, give me a break. This is a movie folks, and we all should be able to enjoy the wonders and fantasy of a great film. If you're like me, and agree with that philosophy, go and see this film.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Love over gold is a great album from one of the greatest rock groups of all time. This masterpiece contains 5 terrific songs and the best songs are Industrial Disease, & It Never Rains.  <br />Go get it with On Every Street.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I really loved this movie.  It is something I don't mind having in the house when grandchildren visit and it illustrates, vividly, a moral that is something for children.  A moral for adults as well, if they're smart enough to recognize it.  This is my second copy of the movie, I gave the first copy to my oldest grandchild so she could show it to her daughters.
B00004XQP4|5.0|To The Infidel. <br /> <br />Your opinion of the band is not needed. Green Day are one of the greatest rock groups of all time. They have lots of talent, they are just as great as Dire Straits, & the great Guns n Roses. This album has great songs like Warning, Minority, Waiting, & Macy's Day Parade. Please ignore the moron below and get this with American Idiot. They rock.
B000002U82|5.0|If you don't understand that then you don't understand music.  I see these kids on here saying that Green Day and My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy are great and Pink Floyd are boring.  Well American Idiot is just the modern day version of dark side.  Its a concept album with some good individual tracks.  My Chemical Romance is a rip off of AFI who were doing the troubled, make up wearing thing ten years ago and doing it much better.  Besides AFI ripped off the Cure, who ripped off Velvet Underground.  Fall Out Boy are a horrible flash in the pan poseur band like the other 99 percent of music out there.<br /><br />When Dark Side came out Pink Floyd was in uncharted territory.  With the exception of Pet Sounds and Sgt Pepper's nobody had tried this before.  That alone wins them points.  The longevity of its success also wins points.  I know that the Red Hot Chilli Peppers are \\"Classic Rock\\" for some people but they're more closely related to Foghat or The Turtles in the History of Rock Music.<br /><br />Bottom line is Dark Side is in the canon of great achievements in 20th century music.  It will be played a hundred years from now as an example of rock music along with the beatles, Elvis and Jimi Hendrix.  It is the pinnacle of 70's music.  It defined its era.<br /><br />The 50's were the RocknRoll of Elvis.  The 60's were the pop of the Beatles and also their artistic and hippy stages.  The 70's were the days of FM radio and album rock.  And it just doesn't get any better than Dark Side.  If you define an era you are automatically in the top ten of any list.<br /><br />These one star reviewers are trying to be cool by not giving this album that everyone else thinks is cool a five star review.  Well its only good to be anti when whatever you're against is worth being anti.  Saying things like Dark side sucks or the beatles are lame or elvis was fat or jimi hendrix was a druggy loser or bob dylan has a bad voice don't make you look cool.  It makes you look young, naive, stupid, and shallow.  Trust me, I bashed Bowie and the Cure for being too (...) for a tough guy until I actually listened to them.  Once I grew up I realized that good music transends genre's and high school cliques.<br /><br />If you kids give some of these classics a chance they might just change your liferust me, I bashed Bowie and the Cure for being too (...) for a tough guy until I actually listened to them.

B00004Y6NW|5.0|This is a good album from Dire Straits, if you like rocking. It contains original classics like Sultans Of Swing, Down To The Waterline, & Lions. Recommended with On Every Street 1991.
B000002UAU|3.0|It's hard for me to give this an under five star review being that I am a Beatles fan but there are just some problems I have with this album.  I think most of the people giving it 5 stars are giving the Beatles 5 stars not the album.  Most of the songs are hokey and throw aways.  Fixing a hole and Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite specifically are weak tracks with nonsense lyrics.  Yes they're catchy, its the beatles, if you want catchy listen to Help or With the Beatles.  A lot of the lyrics are purposefully obtuse to turn of the squares of the time but today sound like some lame inside joke.  The only realy great memorable songs are She's leaving home and A day in the life.  Those two could go on other albums and shine but put lucy in the sky on Abbey Road and it would stick out like a sore thumb.  The other problem is the overproduction.  Hopefully they will someday come out with a stripped down version similar to Let it Be: Naked, which is so great.<br /><br />  Beatles fans seem to come in two varieties Pre Sgt. Pepper's and Post Sgt. Pepper's.  I am DEFINATELY a Post Beatles Fan.  The White Album shines with the sublime Dear Prudence, the haunting While my Guitar Gently Weeps, one of their rockinest songs back in the u.s.s.r, the absolutley bueatiful Blackbird,  the evil sounding Helter Skelter,  and the classic Revolution.  Even the throw aways are good, like cry baby cry and julia.<br /><br />Abbey Road, my personal favorite, is great top to bottom.  Come Together rocks, Oh Darling shows of Paul's pipes better than almost any other song.  Something was described as Frank Sinatra and Elvis as one of the greatest love songs ever.  I want you is so much heavier than anything they ever did. And the ending medley is why people keep writing albums, to come up with something that great.  Don't forget hear comes the sun.<br /><br />Let it be has Get Back, a truly great rock song with the amazing keys by Billy Preston.  Two of us is one of the best examples of harmony vocals ever.  The long and winding road is hauntingly beautiful, accross the universe is a better trippy song than anything on Sgt Peppers or magical mystery tour (with the exeption of Strawberry Fields and possibly I am the Walrus).  Then there's the title track where Paul shines and you can feel his passion.  I dig a pony has some of the greatest John vocals of any Beatles song and a great guitar riff, listen to it again.  Even the one after 909 is a good rocker.  Ok Maxwell's Silver hammer sucks but it would fit right in on Sgt. Pepper's.<br /><br />  I'll never understand the mop top fans.  The beatles were so saccarin sweet they are almost hard for me to listen to for the first four or five albums.  With the Beatles is pretty good and Help has some great hits too.  Rubber Soul is very solid front to back but a little poppy.  Revolver, to me, is their second most overrated album after pepper's.  Yeah its got great tunes but also some throw aways.  And it doesn't have any absolute classics like Come Together or Get Back or Strawberry Fields or Hey Jude or Let it Be.  The sitar stuff gets old quick.<br /><br />  In the moptop years John's songs seem almost out of place because of their honesty and realism compared to Paul's pop fluff.  Listening to Rubber Soul is wierd cause they alternate songs and Paul sounds like he's trying to beat a dead horse and ride their past success while John is making art.  Another reason I prefer Post 67 Beatles is that George is SO much more accomplished on those albums.  A lot of George's songs stand the test of time better than paul's.  Also post 67 at least they had the balls to admit they were using drugs and go with it rather than hide the fact they had been using speed and hash and bagging groupies since the Germany days.  Those early albums are not true reflections of the band because Brian Epstein sanitized everything for the public.  After he died they were on their own and did much better creatively.<br /><br />  I thinkthe reason Sgt. Pepper's gets mentioned as being great so much is because its the last album the mop top fans like and its one of the first albums that Druggie Beatles fans like.  I like it better than their pop bs but not as much as their later stuff.  And a Meet the Beatles, or Help fan can still appreciate the poppy bubble gum songs on Sgt Pepper's like It's Getting Better.<br /><br />  Listen, its a good album and when I was 13 I would have argued it was the greatest ever.  Because of the drug references and the melodies and the wierd effects and the fact it was a concept album and the alblum art.  But since then I've listened to a lot of great music that is better in all of those categories.  If you want a concept album get Dark Side of the Moon.  If you want melodies and harmonies try Crosby, Stills, and Nash.  If you want album art try pink floyd or even tool.  If you want wierd try Frank Zappa.  If you want drug references try anything that came out after this album.  Maybe that's why people like it cause it started the drug music revolution.<br /><br />  I bought this album when I was in 8th grade and loved it.  That same year I also bought Dark side of the Moon and Legend by Bob Marley.  Right now dark side and legend are both in my six disc changer because I can listen to them anytime, all the time and never get sick of them.  I lost my Sgt. Pepper's copy about TEN YEARS AGO.  Never replaced it and never missed it.  I don't plan on buying it anytime soon either.the reason Sgt.

6304698623|5.0|'A Little Princess' is a timeless children's classic that is equally enjoyable for an adult audience. The production values are second to none, the musical score composed by Patrick Doyle is exquiste and Liesel Matthews is magnificent in her starring role as little Sarah.<br /><br />From the opening imaginary sequence in the tropical jungles of India, to the horror of the WWI battlefields of Europe and finally to the elegant but constrained atmosphere of an all-girls bordering school in America, the cinematography is lush, rich and hypnotic. You may start watching this film just to spend some time with your child, but soon you will find yourself drawn into the story for its own sake.<br /><br />One of the great children's films of all-time! Buy this DVD, you'll continue to watch it again and again long after your children are grown and out of the house.

0783226063|5.0|A distant future, another planet. A vast, waterless, desert wasteland where behemoth sandworms roam the sand covered terrain that is Arrakis. These dinosaur-like creatures excrete a substance known as melange or spice, a substance of immeasurable importance, for 'the spice' folds time and makes space travel and interplanetary commerce possible. \\"The Spice Is Life\\" and their are many diverse groups willing to die to possess it. Emperor's, Warlord's, a group of mutant telepaths known as the Spacing Guild and their mystical feminine counterparts, the Bene Genserits conspire against young Duke Atreides and the native people of Arrakis, the Fremen, for the melange and ultimately the rulership of the galaxy.<br /><br />Frank Herbert's epic novel 'Dune' was translated to film by David Lynch in '84 and after one viewing became one of my favorite movies of all-time.<br /><br />Stylish - Epic - Hallucinogenic, there is simply nothing else like it!
B000008LNS|4.0|Toto's only fault, as far as this fan is concerned, is that they tend to need to please everyone.  The first four tracks on this disc rock hard with a meaty bluesy raw edge to them.  Paich plays a gritty B3 on some of these tracks that I dig big time.  Luke can hold his own as a vocalist on the heavier tunes (usually he sings leads on the mellower pop tunes).  \\"Jake to the Bone\\" is a blast. <br /> <br />The band invariabely brings back the layers of synth sounds in much of the album, but so what?  The tracks I'm into are the 35-40 minutes I program into my CD player and they are great fun.  The only other bummer for me is that the recording is a little thin.  Jeff's drums are recorded a little light for my taste. <br /> <br />This is the Toto I have been waiting for.  I am a big fan of \\"Mindfields\\" as well, and look forward to obtaining \\"Falling in Between.\\"  You can often find \\"Kingdom\\" and \\"Mindfields\\" in used CD stores, as well as online. <br /> <br />If you're a Luke fan, you should have \\"No Substitutions\\" and the Paris DVD with Luke and Larry Carlton.  WOW!!
B000E97HIA|2.0|From the very first number--the title track--I had a sinking feeling I'd heard it all before.  And I had: the song \\"3121\\" is a mix of two 90's Prince songs, \\"319\\" and \\"Come.\\"  What follows is a mix of admittedly cohesive, yet hopelessly derivative, songs.  As he did throughout the nineties (when he wasn't singing about --*yawn*--artists' rights), Prince spends an inordinate amount of time trying to justify himself.  In the throwaway pop number \\"Lolita\\", he offers this tired recommendation to the title character: \\"You're much too young to peep my stash/You're writing checks yo body can't cash.\\"  The same can be said for the 2nd single \\"Black Sweat.\\"  A funky percussive beat over horny lyrics...not exactly breaking new ground there (and I know this is trifling, but is a \\"Black Sweat\\" more, uh, sweaty than a regular one?).  The same lyrical limpness plagues \\"Love\\", an otherwise well-intentioned tune which, with its layered keyboards, sounds very much like vintage Prince.  Yet even with his well-known knack for experimentation, hearing Prince's voice through a vocoder (\\"Incense and Candles\\") was a jarring experience.  Ironically, the lovely seduction number \\"Satisfied\\" is the shortest song on the album [insert Viagra joke].<br /><br />The disc's latter half is decidely more spiritual, for the most part.  I read on the npg website that the duet with Tamar is available on her album, so I don't think it was necessary to include it here.  The closing number \\"Get on the Boat\\", a brassy, funky plea for harmony successfully bookends the album by recounting the \\"Don't you want to come?\\" line from the opening number.<br /><br />Prince's detractors having been saying for years that he's tired.  And even the faithful had begun to question him at the start of the new millenium, with the unlistenable \\"Rainbow Children\\" album.  \\"Musicology\\" restored our faith, but this latest offering feels, more than anything, like a batch of songs from Prince's well-known \\"vault\\". . .and most of them probably should have stayed there.f them probably should have stayed there.

Now that the price dropped, after I had paid $105 a season for first three seasons, I ended up buying the whole set and donating the first three seasons to charity, gee after the tax deduction I come out about even for what I paid for the whole set. A heads up, this is not the cheapest you will find the set. Check deepdiscountdvd.com. Not as cool a site as Amazon with its great reviews and many other features, it does offer better prices from time to time. I own the original set, this set, and DS-9. All excellent sets for anyone that likes science fiction. I highly recommend them.
0892818875|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite books on aromatherapy, as it includes not only fairly exhaustive information regarding a variety of essential oils and their effects on mood but how these EOs relate to astrology, mythology and Chinese philosophy.  The book also discusses various techniques employed in using oils and offers clear verbal and visual descriptions of massage techniques.  All in all, I think it's a fascinating and lovely book (there are quite a few full color photographs and drawings).  My only complaint, which isn't much of a complaint, is that Mojay covered \\"only\\" 40 oils.  His descriptions of the oils were so intriguing that I would love to see him publish a completely comprehensive work.
1878424319|2.0|I will never get over remarks of how a book will change your life. Granted, this book made some valid points and surely these agreements can be useful tools towards leading a better life, but I cannot believe the end-all claims this author makes. Like on Page 95, that by following the Four Agreements, \\"you will have a beautiful life.\\" Those of us forced to live in reality know that there is no such simple solution anywhere! It's an OK book, but you'd be better off just borrowing it from the library.
B000002B30|4.0|On the one-star review above, the author claims that the song \\"Walking in Memphis\\" was an E-Street/Springsteen song - that's incorrect. It's actually by Marc Cohn. <br /> <br />As for the album, I love it - this pretty much sums up everything I enjoy about Springsteen's work. My one beef (or two beefs?) is that it doesn't contain \\"I'm on Fire\\" and \\"One Step Up.\\" Apart from that, a great collection.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing both good and bad things from friends that listened to a lot of the same music I do. There aren't many CD's I can put in and listen to all the way through but this one did it for me. I'm not a huge metalcore fan. It Dies Today is about as far as I usually allow myself to go into that genre. But in my opinion BFMV's full length is so much more than any metalcore band has yet to offer. I feel that they blend the singing and screaming a lot better and in a lot of different ways as opposed to just scream the verse then sing a chorus. The screaming on this CD is just brutal. One of the best screaming voices I've ever heard. People have commented that singing is a bit \\"whiny\\". I get where they're coming from but since I listen to bands like From First To Last, Saosin, and Chiodos it was easy for me to look past the tone of the voice and appreciate the melodies. The riffs are just awesome...not really 100% original, but after a coulple hundred years of music who can come up with an original chord progression anymore? Bass just kind of sits there and backs everything up but I'm down with that. Drums are very good...not too technical not to simple. Just enough to compliment the heavy parts, the soft parts, and everything in between. (Reminds me of my style of drumming...which is probably why I like it so much haha) If you're looking for an agressive rock record that doesn't really sound exactly like everything else going on out there, BUY THIS!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best thing I have seen on TV, possibly in my lifetime.  If you don't have this series, please go back to watching television unplugged.  It would be more rewarding. <br /> <br />Fox ordered a cheese burger and Joss delivered fine dining with the Firefly series.  In the Fox executive's \\"make a quick buck\\" mentality, the masterpiece that is Firefly was discarded before the rest of Fox's garbage lineup started to smell bad.  If nothing else, this should teach us something about what television broadcasters care about.  Money, right now.  Even though Firefly would have delivered FAR more in the long run than 15 new trash concepts that would sell well for a few airings, Fox execs couldn't see past their own 15 minute, pocketbook.  Thus, this shining jewel was thrown out with the moldy cheese.  Newsflash, not many big business tycoons care, or will ever care about the content of what they air. <br /> <br />There has not been anything like this on TV.  It takes somewhat of a time investment to fully appreciate.  I have not met one single person who has not fallen in love with this series after a couple of episodes.  This work is inspired.  Also, Joss has stated that he will NOT continue this series under Fox, even if they came begging and pleading back.  The only way we will ever get this back on the air is if another corporation buys the rights from Fox.  This series is so good that the fans alone are trying to raise the money to do so.  The actors love this show too.  Most, if not all, have stated that they would drop everything to go back to Serenity. <br /> <br />If you don't have this, I feel bad for you.

B000E1YW0E|5.0|I heard of RENT about 4 years ago, but never got the chance to see it. I have visited NEW York plenty of times but never got around to it. Since I live in a place where about 2% of the population, my only option was to get the movie. Everything is great about it. I loved it. The movie is heartfelt without a doubt. It sends a powerful message to the rest of the world about AIDS/HIV. I am trying to get others to see it but I live in a reddneck town. RENT won't even think about coming to Tallahassee. Season of Love has to be one of the best in my opinion. I did not like \\"One Song\\" though. Everything else was great. I read about people comparing the movie to the play. However, amazon and the rest of the U.S. needs to know that some of us do not have the opportunity to see the musical. Perfect Cast hands downs. A MUST SEE. Even if you don't like musicals watch the first 5 mins of it. that drag queen is awesome on those with the drumsticks.

B00005JOE8|5.0|I am a huge fan of Alan Moore (and V for Vendetta is my favorite of his works...also liked his run on Swamp Thing and Watchmen)and a bit skeptical about the Wachowski's (The Matrix was incredible...the follow ups, not so much...Bound didn't do it for me either) so I was  not sure how I would like this film. I read several reviews that leaned either towards a masterpiece or the other extreme...this made me really want to see the film. Extremes are one of the things that Mr. Moore's source material dealt heavily with, and finding that opinions pertaining to the film were to the extremes gave me a sense of hope that this would not be a travesty like LXG and From Hell. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. This is the first movie I have seen since Kill Bill Vol. 1 that I would gladly pay full price to see again in theaters, as I do not have the patience to wait for the DVD release. It is everything that Alan Moore wrote, but drastically altered to fit the film media. I loved every performance in this movie, I loved seeing some of my favorite characters from the beginning of the post-modern movement brought to life so dramatically..no they weren't the same through and through, but then old friends are often different when met after a time of absence and I suppose the same holds true for fictional characters. Prothero was nothing like he was in the comic, but he did still collect dolls and his past was the same...Evey wasn't a waifish, naive street walker but her transformation is all the more believable because she actually has some knowledge of the things the state has blacklisted and an appreciation for those things...V, well-he's the same but then he could not be otherwise.  I give this film my highest praise and do believe that if you are a fan of the comic or of extremes you will thoroughly enjoy it. I'm guessing the tagline will be used to sell the DVD...I'll be in line...can't wait for, can't wait for the 5th of November.
B0002XVQPS|3.0|John Q has vomited his invective-filled, nonsensical \\"conservative\\" ramblings all over Amazon, handing out 1 star reviews the way most people hand out business cards.  What's worse than his insane, grammer-challenged rants is his, shall we say \\"creative\\" command of the facts.  Paramount never threatened to sue Fox over the ending fo X2, and contrary to your insane ramblings, the movie was a tremendous success for them.   <br /> <br />As to the set being discussed, it's probably better advised for the dedicated Marvel maniac to buy X2 in the X-MEN movie pack, and pick up the Director's Edition of DAREDEVIL, which is far superior to the released version. LXG isn't worth the disc it's burned on, and is probably better left ignored.  Though I can't recommend the graphic novel enough.

B000ERU9S2|5.0|The definition of the Japanese word ronin describes it as a samurai who has lost his master from the ruin of or the fall of his master. John Frankenheimer (with some final draft help with the script from David Mamet) takes this notion of a masterless samurai and brings to it a post-Cold War setting and sensibility that more than pay homage to the great stories and film of the ronin. One particular story about ronin that Frankenheimer references in detail is the classic story of the 47 Ronin. Ronin shows that in the latter-stages of his career, Frankenheimer was still the master of the political/spy-thriller genre. He infuses the film with a real hard-edge and was able to mix together both intelligence and energy in both the quieter and action-packed sequences in the film.<br /><br />The film begins quietly with the introduction of the characters to be involved. We meet each individual in this quiet 10-minute scene that shows Frankenheimer's skill as a director more than Michael Bay can in two-hours of mind-numbing action. Robert De Niro as one of the two American mercenaries (or contractors) instantly becomes the focal point for everyone. His casual, but attentive reconnoitering of the Paris bar where the first meet occurs helps build tension without being overt. It's with the introduction of Jean Reno as the Frenchman in the group that we get the buddy-film dynamic as De Niro and Reno quickly create a believable camaraderie born of the times for such men during and after the Cold War. The rest of the cast is rounded out by an excellent and high-energy turn from Sean Bean as an English contractor who might not be all that he brags to be. The other American in the group was played by Skipp Sudduth who in his own understated way more than kept up with the high-caliber of actors around him. Finishing off and adding the darker and seedier aspects of the cast were Stellan Skarsgard as a former Eastern Bloc (maybe ex-KGB) operative and Jonathan Pryce as a wanted IRA commander wanted by all. The only break in all the male testosterone in the film was able played by the beautiful, yet tough Natasha McElhone. Like Sudduth, McElhone more than keeps up and matches acting skills with the likes of De Niro, Reno and Skarsgard.<br /><br />The film moves from the meeting of the group to the actual operation which brought all these disparate characters together. Taking a page from Hitchcock, Frankenheimer and Mamet introduces what would become the film's MacGuffin. A MacGuffin being a plot device which helps motivates each character of its importance and yet we're left to believe only that the item is important without ever finding out why. The MacGuffin in Ronin ends up being a silver case which the IRA terrorists, the Russian Mob and seemingly every intelligence agency in Europe wants to get their hands on. It's up to De Niro and his group to steal the case from another party and this was where Frankenheimer's skill in seemlessly blending spy-thriller and action film shows. From the set-up of the team and their plans, to a near double-cross during an arms deal to the actual operation to take the case, Ronin begins to move at a clipped and tension-filled pace. There's no overly extraneous dialogue. Mamet's script-doctoring fleshes out the story and adds a sense and feel of intelligent professionalism to the characters. Outside of the Bean's braggart Englishman who gets his commeuppance from DeNiro's strict professional, everyone in the group had a skill to contribute to the operation and all did it well and believable.<br /><br />The action sequences mostly involved car chases through the narrow streets of Nice, France to the metropolitan thoroughfares and tunnels of Paris. Frankenheimer shines in creating and directing these sequences. Sequences which he'd decided against the use of CGI. Using what he'd learned and perfected from his own past as a former race car driver and from his own classic film Grand Prix, Frankenheimer used real life cars and drove them through real (albeit choreographed) traffic to give the sequences that sense of reality and speed that one couldn't get with CGI. The car chase scene within the Paris thoroughfare tunnel against traffic has to go down as one of the best car chase put on film. I and those I saw the film with were on the edge of our seats as both protagonists and antagonists weaved their way through Parisian traffic at high-speed and gunfire. The crashes caused by this car chase looked believable and horrific yet the audience doesn't glance away from the screen. With just abit of help from second unit directors Luc Etienne and Michel Cheyko, Frankenheimer pretty much did most of the filming of the car chases. At times being in the car itself and doing some of the driving.<br /><br />The story itself, after all the characterizations and high-energy, tense action sequences, was really bare bones and in itself its own MacGuffin. The story just becomes a prop device to help show the mercenaries' special sense of honor in regards to working with people who might've been enemies in the past and the murky world they now live in after the collapse of the black and white sensibility that was the Cold War. One little bit of trivia that I found interesting was the fact that Ronin included quite abit of actors who portrayed past James Bond villains: Sean Bean (Janus), Jonathan Pryce (Carver) and Michael Lonsdale (Drax).<br /><br />In the end, Ronin became the last great film from a great director. I don't count Reindeer Games as anything but Frankenheimer picking up a check and the studio dabbling overmuch in the final look and feel of that film. Frankenheimer's Ronin is a blend of smart dialogue, hard-edged characters, and tense-filled action that he manages to blend together to make a fine and intelligent film.

0399230033|4.0|The colorful illustrations and minimal text allows plenty of storytelling and introducing new concepts as each page is turned. A sturdy enough book to absorb throws. My 15month old loves to 'read' this book as her interest grew in pointing at objects to know what they are called. The book contains enough of a mix of familiar real world objects (moon, keys, banana), and new objects that when she is satisfied with the familiar, she will explore a new thing. The repetition of objects allows her to discover the same new object in several pages and encourages her to search for it as well. To reinforce learning what each animal is called or looks like, I also pull out books with photographs of real animals to relate to ... e.g. a monkey (when reading I use this word instead of 'gorilla' since it is more generic rather than confusing my child with 'chimp' or 'gorilla' or 'ape', etc.).
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Don't get me wrong...I did, indeed like this movie.  It deserved all the acolades it received.  I did make several observations... <br />(1)  If you are looking for an \\"edge of your seat\\" thriller and a new \\"Love Story\\"...this is not the movie...However, it IS a GREAT Character Study / Character analysis.  Ang Lee and the writers did a wonderful job taking what was a (very small) article written in the New York times and expand it into a great film. <br /> <br />(2)  I was very impressed by the cinematography.  The events seemed \\"real\\"..the backdrops and scenery was lush.  It almost made me want to get in my car and find Brokeback Mountain (okay, and a man to go with). <br /> <br />(3)  The movie does have a GREAT ending.  I was stunned.   <br /> <br />(4)  The soundtrack is a great -- please don't listen to it when you are in a \\"down mood\\".  Nonetheless, it's imaginative, creative and worth listening to. <br /> <br />I will wait, however, until this film comes out in full screen version.  For some reason I have an aversion to the \\"letter box\\" format.  It downright drives me CRAZY. <br /> <br />I have to say that while I love Heath in this film, Jake was much overlooked for his character/portrayal.

Instead of seeing costume tests for the movie or background for designs for Miss Hepburn we get a parade of movie clips from Tiffany's and other Audrey Hepburn movies from the studio. It would have been interesting to have some background on the design for the movie and the famous \\"feud\\" of Edith Head signing sketches of Givency's creations (i.e. the \\"Little Black Dress\\") Then there is the commentary by the producer who naters on and on about such things as the use of the typewriter in the movie is so dated and the fact that upon seeing a closeup of Buddy Epson \\"How blue his eyes are\\" and the tiresome \\"in hindsight\\" he wouldn't have cast Mickey Rooney in the comic role of the Japanese Photographer. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to hear Blake Edward's take on it?  And, in fact Blake Edwards Commentary itself? Why Hepburn took the role, how she prepared.  The viewer gets no inside knowledge as to why the movie became a classic in the first place. All we get is \\"Now we are in New York; Now, this shoot is in Hollywood\\".

B000E994KE|5.0|It's difficult to change vocalists and retain the same following, but Amorphis have achieved it. Eclipse is the third chapter in Amorphis' career. When they first started out, guitarist Tomi Koivusaari sang and played the guitar. Then came their amazing second singer Pasi Koskinen, stepping in for their Elegy masterpiece, with both clean and death vocals. The band released a string of successful albums with Koskinen until 2004's Far from the Sun, where they not only abandoned their folky roots and psychedelic backdrop, but also took on a relatively more modern sound. The album was criticised severely by the band's fanbase and led to the departure of Pasi Koskinen who perhaps couldn't summon the necessary inspiration anymore.<br /><br />Enter Sinisthra vocalist Tomi Joutsen, hence the third chapter of the band. Not only is Eclipse a perfect return to form, it also marks the release of their heaviest album since 1996's Elegy. Joutsen is an absolutely stunning vocalist, with so much power and emotion in his delivery. Most fans, myself included, thought it impossible to fill Koskinen's shoes, but the impossible has happened. Considering the songs on this album, Joutsen seems like a much better fit than Koskinen would ever have. Repeat listens reveal Amorphis harkened back to their previous albums, combining the best sides of Elegy, Tuonela, and Am Universum. The album kicks off with the powerful \\"Two Moons\\", showcasing a very strong vocal performance and plenty of proggy keyboard lines. The piece has a strange Elegy feel to it, moreso sonically than musically. With \\"Leaves Scar\\", a song that opens with a folky acoustic intro, the band plays out some great rhythmic grooves, utilising fierce death growls and harmonised back-up singing. Some of the melodies, like the one on \\"Born from Fire\\", are the band's strongest in a long time. Both catchy and intense, this song sounds like a heavier leftover from the Tuonela sessions, except with more throaty vocals. There is a nice piano interlude in the middle that repeats the said melody which is then replaced by a terrific guitar lead.<br /><br />Two songs particularly stand out as catchier and more straightforward than before, especially by Amorphis' standards. \\"House of Sleep\\" is very much like a Sentenced song circa Crimson where they were at their most melodic (and relatively less mainstream compared to the two albums they followed it up with). Even Toni Joutsen sings like Ville Laihiala did here employing an utterly engaging chorus along the way, until the breaking point where Amorphis makes the piece their own with the arrival of a nice piano and synth lead respectively. Much like \\"House of Sleep\\", the closing track \\"Empty Opening\\" features a very Sentenced-like chorus, only darker and more aggressive. This wouldn't seem too out of place on Frozen, easily their darkest and most suicidal release.<br /><br />Those who've been expecting a more psychedelic album a la Elegy will be very pleased with \\"Under A Soil and Black Stone\\", a song highlighted by odd sound effects, whilst those looking for a more Tales from the Thousand Lakes vibe should enjoy \\"The Smoke\\" for its haunting death growls and \\"Brother Moon\\" for its folk meets prog meets death metal approach. This is quite possibly the most progressive song on the album, along with \\"Same Flesh\\", a piece with blazing organ leads and interesting backing harmonies.<br /><br />Amorphis have returned with one of their strongest albums to date.

B000EGF0B4|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever seen bar none. Two children who had never been loved found someone who loved them. Any filmmaker who shows me the kind of joy that these two displayed when they were together will bring me to the box office over and over again. I will bring my children and my grandchildren and my parents and my cousins and my aunts and uncles and I don't care about the sex. I want to see that joy over and over again even when I know it has to end in tragedy. In fact, the more wonderful it is, the sooner and more painful the ending has to be. If this movie has a flaw it is the heart stopping abruptness of the post card with DECEASED stamped across it. I needed some music or something to mark the occasion. To all the movie producers out there, show me the joy of loving another human being and I will make your movie a hit.

I believe it was written for a younger group of people but its been done so well that really anyone could get into it, making it a thoroughly enjoyable series! Its about magic, romance, mystery and action (you cant beat that); but it also tells its story in a way that is different than other regular fantasies, bringing it both life and reality.<br /><br />It doesnt take long to fall in love with this story and while it doesnt take long to finish the book itself- its a thouroghly enjoyable novel. I'd say read a little of it and if you like it- buy the set! Its well worth it. I bought mine used and I'd have to say that it only seems to add to the flavor of the book that its been used and read before- plus it saves lots of money!<br /><br />There's my advise, I hope you enjoy Sabriel and others by Garth Nix as much as my family and I have, and may the Charter preserve us all. *wink
0446577383|1.0|Having taken a few days to let the disappointment pass, I will concede that the story and characters are interesting, but it is all a bit scattered. The politics contained in this novel are completely one-sided which I believe makes it less interesting.    It never lives up to its potential and interesting characters are wasted with story telling that focuses more on the politics of the author than the drama of the situation.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|When tickets to the show Rent first went on sale, I knew I had to purchased them for our family.  By then we were all familiar with the story fo Joanthan Larson who wrote the show and tragically died before the show even opened.  Legends esepcially on Broadway are made of stories like these but for me there was a more perosnal reason to see this show.  Having grown up in the East Village I was familiar with the area and the people who both lived and worked there.  But for several reasons I was disappointed with the show although I loved the music and purchased the album. Then I read a movie based on the show was being made and when I saw the trailers I knew I had to see this again.  I seriously wondered how they would capture the essence of Manhattan and the high energy of the performers. But I didn't have to wonder for long.  From the first scene with the 8 principal actos standing on stage singing Seasons of Love, I knew I was in for a movie treat. Not only did I enjoy the movie, I loved it and plan to purchase it so I can watch it again and again.<br /><br />Based on the opera La Boheme, Rent tells the story of a group of young people living, loving and dying in the area of Manhattan called the East Village.  Known as the hub of the 60's movement 40 odd years ago, in recent years the area became known for squatters and disenchanted young adults. For me, familiar with the area, the movie had all of the energy of this part of Manhattan and the lives of those who live there.<br /><br />Focusing on 8 individuals that included Angel, a drag queen with AIDS, his lover Tom to Maureen a performance artist and finally to Marc, a filmmaker who in the end captured their story for all times.  While the show was loud and at times I felt the performers were shouting over the music, the film was beautifully conceived and allowed the listener to make sense of the words.  The actors, most of them from the Broadway<br /><br />show, were excellent. With the exception of The Sound of Music and Chicago it is rare that I think a movie based on a Broadway musical is better.  But in the case of the movie Rent, I loved every minute of this movie and was sorry to see it end.  The music so poignant continues to play in my head and I am sure the late Jonathan Larson must be smiling down from heaven to see how well this movie was made by Chris Columbus. While the subject matter is difficult at times and at the very least gripping and poignant, I suggest this movie to all who would enjoy seeing an excellent film.f Music and Chicago it is rare that I think a movie based on a Broadway musical is better.

B000002A3T|2.0|This does have some good \\"Floyd\\" moments both lyrically and musically.  BUT IT HAS NO EDGE!!!  I am so disapointed by Gilmour's solo album and by this album now that I've busted it out and tried to give it another round.  It sounds like Dark Side after hearing Gilmour's new album, but it still stinks.  Waters was the edge and the thunder of Pink Floyd and Gilmour is just floating around without him.  It would be like calling The Beatles The Beatles without Lennon.  I've seen Waters live and \\"Pink Floyd\\" in '94 and Waters show had more heart and soul.  The Floyd show was cold and meant for fans who think Gilmour's name is Pink Floyd.  The sum was greater than the individual parts in Pink Floyd and they all continue to show it.  Buy this only if you're desperate-it's worth $5 tops.
B000244FDW|5.0|We thought my daughter might wear out the VHS tape version of this BBC Pride and Prejudice series. Maybe it is not the same quality as the Colin Firth version, but it is the one she loves. Now that we have a couple of copies of the DVD we know it should last until she can show it to her children. It got so that even my son could repeat lines from this version. <br /> <br />BTW - Don't watch this version and then watch Horatio Hornblower. You forget time has passed and people change and David Rintoul matures a lot from P&P to Hornblower. <br />

I love all his 60's stuff as well as almost every album he's ever done.  Sweet Tea is him sounding his best ( a must have in anyone's record collection).  If you've never had the chance to see Buddy live GO NOW!  It's worth whatever you have to pay.  You'll see why Hendrix worshipped the guy.

B00005K9LN|3.0|Judas Priest's 1980 offering 'British Steel' is easily Priest most overrated album. This is still a solid release though. I've stopped reviewing on Amazon for a while since there was insanity going on and I was running out of money. Now after I made some cash Priest's latest release 'Angel of Retribution' inspired me to complete my Priest collection and this was the first album on my list and I tried to but I just don't like it.     This is Priest's 2nd most popular album next to 'Screaming for Vengeance' (which is a step up from this but still overrated and below average for Priest). It's not so much that there are too many lame songs here it's just that (to me) the only 3 songs that worth listening are 'Rapid Fire', 'United' and 'Grinder', all the other are okay but they are not hooking or making me wanna listen to them over and over. The 2 hits off the album 'Breaking the Law' & 'Living After Midnight' infact do rock the house when you're in mood for them but relativly they are bland and in fact are not really metal, more like pop/rock anthems. 'Metal Gods' is goofy despite a good solo.    I think if Glenn and KK worked harder this could have been much better. Now they are excellent guitarists but their work here simply doesn't compare to the work they did on their earlier efforts or on 'Painkiller'. There's too much repetition in riffs and none of the solos here made me think \\"wow that's amazing!\\". Sorry for Rob Halford and Ian Hill who really made here great job and that I can't deny. But another downside is drummer Dave Holland which isn't half-bad but compared to their prevousw drummer Les Binks or to the next Scott Travis he can't really keep up. However the production on this album is one of the best I've ever heard on a metal album, this was the first album produced by Tom Allon and he really deliverd here, unlike on the band's next efforts were the production there is pretty weak.    All in all, this isn't terrible, but it could have been much better. While this is not as dull as Rocka Rolla, Point of Entry, Turbo, Ram it Down or Demolition this is no Sad Wings and it's not as good as other releases in 1980 like Maiden's debut or Sabbath's 'Heaven & Hell' (although I'll rank it above Back In Black). I'll rank this somewhere in the middle in Priest's catalogue.

B00005K9LM|4.0|Judas Priest's 9th studio album released in 1984. Defenders of the Faith is yet another great album. <br /> <br />Many fans consider this album to be Priest last great album or the band's finest hour. It's not quite Priest's best (the title goes to Painkiller) but it's still excellent. In fact this is in my opinion the band's only great album from the 80's, everything else from this era (yep, including Steel and Vengeance) didn't cut. You may ask why. This is basically the album where Glenn and KK became real guitarists, unlike on the band's 3 previous efforts where the riffs were repeated over and the solos were mediocre, here it's not only the guitarist's best work but also some of the best dual-guitar attack I've ever heard, what also makes this the band's 2nd heaviest album (next to Painkiller).  <br /> <br />The album starts off with one of the best Priest album openers, 'Freewheel Burning', which is heavy, thrashy and has an excellent solo. 'Jawbreaker' is pretty good also. The 3rd song is my favorite song on the album, 'Rock Hard Ride Free', while is not that heavy and pretty slow everyone is phenomenal here. It's basically a song about a Harley rider, it has also the best riffing on the album. Then comes a fan favorite, if not somewhat overrated, 'The Sentinel' where Rob does a great job here. 'Love Bites' & 'Eat Me Alive' are groovy and catchy despite what Rob Halford is. Then comes the hit off the album 'Some Heads Are Gonna Roll' which has great chorus but maybe a bit repetitive. The last 3 tracks are 'Night Comes Down', 'Heavy Duty' and the title track, they are okay although I never really cared for them, still great way to close the album. <br /> <br />It could have been better. Therefore I took a half star from the rating. First the production is not great, I don't know if the original version sounded better since I've only recently got this CD. Rob Halford while he did here a decent job on the vocals, this is his worst work and that doesn't say muchwhen it's Halford, but sometimes he uses high-pitched vocals that sound raspy and this is somewhat annoying. The drums here are still mediocre. But despite these flaws it still worths the price. <br /> <br />Favorite 3 songs:  <br />Rock Hard Ride Free <br />Freewheel Burning <br />The Sentinel <br /> <br />Long live Priest!!

B000E1155E|3.0|With \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not,\\" the Arctic Monkeys are probably both blessed and cursed. Blessed to the extent that the band's debut album has caught a wave of hype almost guaranteed to ensure its commercial success. Cursed because no record could possibly deliver on the promises made that this is The Next Big Thing in pop music.    The key here is to approach \\"Whatever People Say ...\\" with an open mind, and ignore the ravings of critics, PR flacks, and anyone else with an ax to grind or a profit to be made on it. That said, this is a decently respectable album with about a half-dozen good songs on it, but nothing that will blow you away in awe at the raw creativity and sheer talent of the group. IMHO, the best tracks are as follows:       * The View From The Afternoon     * I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor     * Fake Takes Of San Francisco     * Riot Van     * Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secure     * A Certain Romance    In addition, \\"Mardy Bum,\\" \\"Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But ...\\" and \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" are not bad songs either. There are a lot of power chords here, and some occassionally catchy guitar riffs and clever wordplay, but it all sounds very primitive and not especially well produced, which is sort of a good thing in a way. A better engineer and more skillful musicians would just undermine the scratchy charm of these simple tunes and highlight their deficiencies.     Other reviewers have compared the Arctic Monkeys to the White Stripes, and there is a superficial resemblance. However, even with their derivative licks from virtually every other metal band of the past 20 years, these young guys from Britain are far more original than anything I've heard yet from the overrated Stripes.    So while \\"Whatever People Say ...\\" isn't likely to end up as an instant classic in the manner of, say, \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" I would argue with my hipster librarian friend who dismissed it as \\"Conspiracy suckola\\"riding a crest of infotainment merchandising and packaged rebellion.    In short, if you tone down your expectations of this record, you could be very pleasantly surprised. Just don't buy into the superlative praise lavished on the band or the album. The lads show they have potential here, but they're hardly the second coming of the Beatles.
B000002BQK|5.0|About nine years ago, Mariah had her first \\"emancipation\\" when she divorced her husband/mentor Tommy Mottola, & took a direct hand with how her music sounded.<br /><br />In the latter half of 1997, Mariah gave us \\"Butterfly\\", a sleek, classy, record that showed an artist aware of her strengths.  At the same time, the record showed Mariah's move toward a more mainstream \\"R&B\\" and/or \\"hip hop\\" oriented sound.  It shouldn't have come as much surprise; her previous album had showed signs of her interest to move her sound into that field.  Specifically, both the hit singles from \\"Daydream\\", \\"Fantasy\\" & \\"Always Be My Baby\\" had equally successful remix counterparts that were more rooted in the hip hop sound & found that the audience embraced this sound from Mariah.<br /><br />Hip hop's finest turned out for this, from Sean Combs, to Missy Elliott, her mainstay collaborator Walter Afanasieff also worked over this record. Mariah was clever in that she didn't abandon her pop sound; so much as infuse it with an urban element.  So, what you have is a record that featured her famous pop leanings with more R&B & hip hop textures. She could also execute these textures as an up-tempo number or in her famous ballad fashion.<br /><br />The first cut & single \\"Honey\\" is a bit more of a groove, but it finds Mariah's voice floating above the sassy samples of urban classics such as \\"Hey D.J.\\" & \\"The Body Rock\\". The song is slinky & rather funky, a tempo slower than \\"Fantasy\\". It also continued in the vein of Mariah's sample-laden lead off singles.<br /><br />Other highlights include the utterly lush \\"My All\\", which found Mariah taking a page from Gloria Estefan's \\"Destiny\\" album the year before. With the actual inclusion of authentic Latin influences, the song has a very subtle, yet passionate feel compositionally. Vocally, Mariah worked out her lower register before taking the track back to her classic highs on the chorus.  \\"Fourth of July\\" was a continuation of \\"Underneath the Stars\\" from \\"Daydream\\", but for some reason here, this track actually works well, better than what she had done with \\"Underneath the Stars\\".<br /><br />Probably the best cut & Mariah's best ever hip-hop collaboration was with Bone Thugs & Harmony on the album center, \\"Breakdown\\". Lyrically, the song tells of the insecurity & desolation that a faded love brings & Mariah delivers it with a conviction that has rarely been seen.  The chorus is delivered in a rapid-fire, almost rap-like fashion, this would become more common place on her post-\\"Butterfly\\" records.  The collaboration itself finds Bone Thugs & Harmony lending background vocals & ad-libs, and then taking the spotlight toward the beginning of the end of cut.  They don't drown Mariah out, like many of her latter day hip hop collaborations would, but actually compliment her by sharing the limelight at the right time, yet staying out of her way to let her do her thing.<br /><br />Her cover of the Prince staple \\"The Beautiful Ones\\", from the album \\"Purple Rain\\", while unremarkable is still a pleasant listen. It would've been more pleasant without Dru Hill's front man Sisquo adding his obnoxious histrionics onto the song.<br /><br />From an image stand-point, Mariah embraced her repressed sexuality & took a direct hand in how image could help her get her music across to new audiences. All of the subsequent videos for this album found Mariah finally becoming more of a \\"video artist\\". She also showed a bit more restraint before taking her look to a more \\"campy\\" style that has characterized her of late.<br /><br />\\"Butterfly\\" was a success, cementing Mariah's musical legend even further with two number one singles & a top five or two.  It showed that she could move forward without her mentor & do the music she wanted.  Though, it seems that Mariah's sales became a bit more polarized.  The 10 million+ sales of \\"Daydream\\" were literally halved as only five million+ copies of this record shifted.  A success, but it showed thata part of her audience, mostly White, had not cared for her embracing more of her African-American audience.  This is more of a personal observation, but I think the sales back me up here.<br /><br />That aside, this record stands as Mariah's strongest record to date, one that she drew inspiration from for her recent opus \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\". From top to bottom, \\"Butterfly\\" truly echoes the sentiments of freedom & hope; with a bit of an edge mind you.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys mainstream pop, R&B, hip hop music.bracing more of her African-American audience.

1573223085|5.0|Ever since Peter Drucker pointed out that the future performance of organizations in the developed world would be in the hands of knowledge workers, we've been blessed with an understanding that the dominant economic focus can shift rapidly into new directions.  Prior to that, the industrial age had lasted for over two centuries.  The agricultural age that preceded it lasted several thousand years, and the hunter-gatherer age had lasted even longer.<br /><br />What is the conceptual age?  It's a time when due to applying all of our brain's many functions and the many advances of technology that we enjoy, a person can imagine totally different ways to serve and entertain others.  Imagination is the limit.<br /><br />A number of people have preceded Mr. Pink's message in partial ways such as those who have written about the entertainment economy, works about serious play, cataloguers of storytelling best practices and those who consider emotional intelligence.<br /><br />But I think Mr. Pink's concept is both bigger and more accurate than that which has preceded this book.  Most methods of making improvements only harness parts of our capabilities and serve only parts of our needs.  Anyone who has sat in a traffic jam recently realizes that.  What good is s beautiful sports car if traffic is bumping along at 10 mph?  Put that same driver into a Grand Prix simulator, and the person comes alive in a way that's almost beyond belief.<br /><br />Mr. Pink points out six key opportunities to supplement traditional, linear thinking.  These are design, story, symphony (integration of disparate elements), empathy, play and meaning.<br /><br />I think, however, that Mr. Pink is wrong about these being the primarily undeveloped senses.  Given what I've read about brain research, I wouldn't be surprised if aroma, physical touch, musical stimulation, simulation and directed meditation didn't end up being as, if not more, important.<br /><br />Some will be disappointed that Mr. Pink doesn't give them a manual to operate in the new age.  Given how little we know about how to engage one another in these other ways, time will have to pass before we have what amounts to instructions.  In the meantime, Mr. Pink does a good job of pointing towards experiences and books that can help with whole brain development.<br /><br />If you think the problem with the economy is that we have too few engineers, you should read this book.  It'll take you ahead into a future you need to start preparing for now.<br /><br />To give you a sense of how important I think Mr. Pink's concept is, I made this book the focus of this week's briefing for The Billionaire Entrepreneurs' Master Mind.ed that Mr. Pink doesn't give them a manual to operate in the new age.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice.  It is probably my absolute favorite book.  I've watched the BBC production of Pride and Predjudice and it was outstanding.  It is hard to imagine a better Mr. Darcy than Colin Firth.  I wanted to share this great story with my 11 year old daughter, and she has tried to watch the BBC production... but at 5+ hours, its very difficult for her to sit through, let alone understand. This latest adaptation is perfect for the newest generation of hopeful Jane Austen fans.  It has characters they recognize and can understand and it is considerable shorter than its BBC counterpart.  The setting and musical score are gorgeous, and although the story is not \\"pure\\" Jane Austen, it comes pretty darn close.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I read \\"Wicked\\" by Gregory Maguire a few years ago, and was tempted to see the Broadway musical, but never did. What a loss! I've lost my chance to see this cast perform.  <br /> <br />Fortunately, I have this wonderful soundtrack to listen to and enjoy. Both Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel have amazing, powerful voices and tremendous range. Their vocal talents, particularly Menzel's, are nothing short of awe-inspiring. The music is dramatic, moody, beautiful, and bold. This CD is pure magic-thank you Stephen Schwartz!  <br /> <br />For those who haven't read the book (read it!) or seen the show (it's touring now, though not with this cast), the song lyrics and the bits of dialogue at the beginning of most of the songs will help you piece together the basic plot. I bought this CD solely on the merits of \\"Defying Gravity,\\" which I heard on Sirius Radio's Broadway's Best. In my opinion, \\"Defying Gravity\\" is the best song on the CD and really gives Idina Menzel a perfect vehicle to show off her powerhouse vocals and stunning range. It actually moved me to tears. But make no mistake: all of the songs are strong, and very good. And it's wonderful to hear the legendary Joel Grey, who must be in his 60's by now, in such great voice as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br />After hearing this CD, I truly regret not seeing this on Broadway when I had the chance. But the dramatic music, the lyrics, and the talents of Chenoweth and Menzel bring these songs to vivid life for me, and for that, I'm grateful. I can only imagine how much more I'd love this CD if I had memories of the production to draw upon! <br /> <br />Buy this CD, play it loud, and immerse yourself in the wonderful, beautiful, dark, and--above all-complex World of Oz.
B00004RF9B|5.0|FORBIDDEN PLANET is an eminently watchable flick in its own right and one of the essential science-fiction movies of the 1950s -- along with THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, and THEM! There are others we love (I myself have a great and abiding fondness for I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE, and some folks swear by WAR OF THE WORLDS), but these five, though they did not exhaust the genre (as Hollywood understood the genre), certainly defined it during their decade and well into the 1960s, until 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. <br />

B00005JOE8|2.0|If V is for Vendetta and T is for Terrorism, what would the questions be?  This is not a critic of the film per say, but instead a critic of the worldview behind the movie.  So many times we accept the \\"signals\\" that we receive from radio, tv, internet, and other popular media, so much so that we fail at times to consider the worldview behind the signals.  Hence this review is not about the movie itself, which I will say is a good movie just like it was based upon a good comic book graphic novel.  Instead, I wish to examine, in this review, the worldview presented--a worldview (or set of worldviews) that we might not consider when we just sit back, eat our popcorn, and watch the silver screen.<br /><br />Where does heroism (with worldviews) end and terrorism (with worldviews) begin?  Who's to say that the terrorists of 9-11 are wrong, but the heroism of V from the movie is correct?  When is blowing up buildings \\"good\\" and when is it \\"bad\\", who's to say, you or I?  That is a strong and complicate question one that we must face today in this post-9-11 world that we live in, especially those of us who live in the United States, a place where so many times we forget just how volatile the world is outside our pristine middle class to upper middle class neighborhoods.  Even the most prayerful of us probably felt an unrealistic tug upon our hearts minds and souls when we watched 9-11 those, about six, years ago.  Now, after the towers fell, we see images of the aftermath, wars and rumors of wars going throughout the middle east, politicians going toe to toe either complimenting the war effort or condemning the war effort, either way using \\"political talk\\" (which to even the most intellectual of us, still can't be figured out).  Where does vendetta end and terrorism begin?  That is a problematic point this movie is trying to make in the worldview this movie is presenting.  Would it not be true to say that, several hundred years ago, our Founding Fathers and the men they commanded were seen as heroes to most of the colonists while seen as dastardly villains to most of England?  One man's hero is another man's cold blooded killer, no matter what flag or religion is being viewed...at least that is what this movie's worldview tries to speak.<br /><br />Yet there is something more problematic besides the ambiguous moral this movie presents to the many theater goers who are enjoying this movie.  It seems to blame, and I would guess that to a point this would be true, that religion and political ideals are the root cause of totalitarianism.  I know that I have heard people speaking against me in the media and internet because I am a Christian, but more to the point, people blaming Christians and all other religions as the reason for problems in this world (at least religions that are not politically correct and haven't gone by the PC checklist of groups like the ACLU).  I say this as someone who says of himself as being a fundamentalist Christian, that is someone who treats the Bible as THE Word of God and that the Bible presents truthfully that Jesus IS the Way, the Truth, and the Life.  Many people, and I think that in some sense being shown in the worldview of V for Vendetta, seem to think that all fundamentalist Christians, of whom I consider myself one of, all want to abolish and destroy everything from homosexuality to abortion clinics.  Which is strange because I've never gone out to abuse anyone who was going into a clinic despite the fact that yes I do consider myself prolife.  Why would I consider myself prolife and applaud those who wickedly bomb clinics?  That just doesn't make sense, but the ultraliberals of the country seem to place me in the same \\"room\\" as those who commit such crimes.  Same goes for homosexuality.  I have many gay friends who know that I have a very intricately woven belief system based upon what I have read and continue to read in the Bible.  Yet those same ultraliberals out there seem to say that I am in the same \\"room\\" as those who attack homosexuals.  Strange, but true, at least when you listen to the ultraliberal elites.<br /><br />Am I saying the movie is Anti-Bush like some other reviewers seem to gain from my review of the worldview behind V for Vendetta, well answer is, who knows besides the minds of the writers and directors themselves.  They may have a slant toward opposing Bush, but alike anyone else seeing the movie, we dont see a dart board with Bush's face on it being used in the local pub as a game of chance (that being darts).  Still, I think that the worldview toward a humanistic utopian is a cliche, that is the worldview that I am gathering from integrating both the comic book graphic novel and the movie itself, pulling together the woven pattern of thoughts and counter-thoughts.  The movie and book seems to suggest that faith and government (at least a conservative form of government) leads to totalitarianism.  Whether you agree or disagree that is yours to hold unto.  I merely, an observer, wish to bring up some thoughts that the movie has awakened unto me.<br /><br />Still.  Let us say that we do outlaw faith and we do end free enterprise and other such evils, at least what is being pointed out as being evil by this movie and many writers and speakers like Sam Harris who wrote the Christianphobic book, End of Faith, and many writers and speakers like Clint Willis who wrote the antiCapitalistic book, The I Hate Corporate America Reader.  Then what?  That is the world the movie V for Vendetta seems to look toward as a utopia.  V for Vendetta, I believe, just as the comic book that spawned the movie, longs for what I would have to say, a true and pure humanistic world ... but who would make the rules of this world and who would be the ones who followed such rules?  Just because you brought about a vacuum doesn't mean that the vacuum won't get stained by the fact that humans are, as the Bible shows, basically evil due to the Fall.  Does nature not abhor a vacuum?  What would take the place?  I would not be surprised to see, in this \\"utopian\\" world that so many people long for roving bands out to lynch anyone who said they believed that Jesus was their Savior, just like they would lynch anyone who would say that free enterprise brings about true economic growth.  Do we not see the lynching already taking place in our school systems and in our universities and in our politik speaks? Yes we do.  Thus, in the end I would have to say the worldview of V for Vendetta spawns more questions than answers, and with each examination of such questions to answers, a greater sense of foreboding and danger arises.as those who attack homosexuals.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|In general, biographical films tend to be troublesome: how do you do justice to ANYONE's life in 120 minutes?  Much less a musical legend with a life full of such intrigue and drama that it could fill several years worth of the National Enquirer, front to back? <br /> <br />First of all I must admit that I am not generally a fan of many things that are front and center in this film, those being country music, musicals, Jonny Cash, and heavily biographical films in which we're shown the rich artist as a poor, lil child, only to turn into a major singer later in life, complete with tough breaks in love and all sorts of drug and alcohol problems. That said, if you're looking at this film on paper, that's pretty much what you get, but if you actually watch the movie, you'll get a lot more out of it, mainly due to the film's two lead actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both of whom take over their real-life counterparts' personas entirely, and deliver two of the most resonant performances of the year.   <br />I found myself utterly swept away with this gritty yet utterly enchanting story of Jonny Cash and the story of the great love that grew between country stars Cash and June Carter during the early years of Cash's career. \\"Walk the Line\\" is the result of intense collaboration between director James Mangold, co-writer Gill Dennis, Johnny Cash, and June Carter Cash. Though both Cashes died in 2003, they oversaw the script's development for seven years. Mangold and Cash's insistence that the film's stars would actually sing paid off. Witherspoon's singing (as June) is lovely, and Phoenix's contains the raw energy and soul that defined Cash's sound. Even as a child on a cotton farm in Depression-era Arkansas, Cash shows a strong interest in music, escaping from his no-frills life and strict father (Robert Patrick) through hymns and listening to the radio. When his brother dies in a freak accident, young Johnny feels responsible, and worries that he will never live up to his brother's goodness.  <br />The film follows Cash through his first marriage with Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin) and into the early stages of his touring career alongside such musicians as Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, and most importantly, June Carter. As Cash's success grows, so does his relationship with drugs, alcohol, and Carter, putting a strain upon his family life. From his initial audition with Sam Phillips of Sun Records on through his legendary 1968 concert at Folsom Prison, Cash is transformed from a hesitant singer riddled with demons to a man whose uniquely bold style would make music history.  <br /> <br />At the film's opening, Cash (Phoenix) sits alone in a side room fingering a saw blade, then flashes back to his childhood on a cotton farm. His overbearing father (Robert Patrick) blames him for his older brother's accidental death, which may or may not have been prevented had Cash been working with him instead of fishing. The severity of Ray Cash's \\"it should have been you, J.R.\\" mentality will stay with Johnny Cash always, creeping into his songs and his medicine cabinet. <br /> <br />The story is simple enough, and at times conventional. Cash's relationship with his first wife, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), is relegated to the standard \\"we can't make rent,\\" and, \\"I'm jealous of those screaming girls on the tour\\" kind of strife, which no doubt happened, but wasn't there something deeper?  <br />Nonetheless, Mangold creates savory moments that not only subvert convention, but yield new insight. Cash's first session with Sam Phillips at Sun Records (a bit part played like a big one by Dallas Roberts) - when Phillips preaches to Cash and his dopey-eyed backup gospel singers about the kind of songs that really save people (the kind that sell records) - is one of the more sheerly fun scenes in film this year; second, perhaps, to the theology lesson delivered by Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne). <br />These moments -what it's like in the car with Cash, Lewis and gang - are the sort of things easily left out of a biography, and they are the kind of details without which a biography seems devoid of the life it's trying to explain. Witherspoon becomes the unlikely anchor of this film - the peg around which all of its honesty is tethered. We see it in the way she responds to a store clerk lecturing Carter on the moral implications of divorce, and in the way she instantly recovers, on the surface, because she has to buoy Cash. <br /> <br />\\"Walk the Line\\" never attempts to paint a full picture of Cash's prolific career, but instead focuses on the passions that drove his music and on the woman who gave him strength. With magical performances by Witherspoon and Phoenix, a haunting and inspiring American romance is brought beautifully to life. All together now, \\"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaw, now wasn't that the cutest little love story?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Walk the Line\\" leaves approximately 35 years of Cash's life untouched, and has gaps in much of the time it does cover. This is a good thing. Many films about legendary figures forget that legends make their own records. These films try to cover too much ground and suggest that all of life's conflicts should be resolved, or reach an end. But the best ones leave an open door, recognizing that legends - the dark parts, happy parts, and all - never stop revealing themselves.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Over the years Hollywood has produced innumerable romantic comedies in which two people, obviously attracted to (and perfect for) one another, are kept apart by circumstances for a couple of hours until the artificial barriers between them are torn down and they wind up in each other's arms. Most of them have been terrible, but British director Joe Wright's new version of the Jane Austen tale which is the granddaddy of them all proves that if you only return to the source, and treat it if not with absolute fidelity at least with respect, the experience can be delightful. This is a lively, colorful, intelligent retelling of the template for all the later books and movies about two people obviously destined to be together who remain apart all too long due to misunderstandings and the machinations of others. Its sensibility is more modern than Austen's, of course, but that doesn't mean it's any less enjoyable on its own. <br /> <br />At just a bit over two hours, this \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" can't include as much of the detail of Austen's original as the well-regarded five-hour BBC mini-series of 1995, which starred Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. But in Deborah Moggach's skillful adaptation it contains enough to convey the flavor of the book, as well as the basic plot, very successfully, though the tone is more overtly romantic; in this respect it's certainly the equal of the famous 1940 film with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. And Wright proves remarkably adept at infusing the action not only with the serenity and charm it needs, but with lightness and vivacity as well, an effect achieved especially by his penchant for fast-moving tracking shots, beautifully managed by cinematographer Roman Osin. Osin's luscious widescreen images have the benefit of focusing on lovely locations and utterly convincing period accouterments; the production design by Sarah Greenwood, art direction by Ian Baille, Mark Swain and Nick Gottschalk, set decoration by Katie Spencer and costumes by Jacqueline Durran are all superb. One could spend one's time just luxuriating in the visual splendor on the screen, made even happier by Dario Marianelli's pleasantly evocative score. <br /> <br />But the meat of the story is in the characters, of course, and here too the film proves outstanding. Keira Knightley makes ample amends for her dreadful performance in \\"Domino\\" by portraying the strong-willed, level-headed Elizabeth Bennet as a young woman of both (dare one say it) spunk and an undercurrent of melancholy. Matthew Macfadyen, happily not a conventionally handsome sort, matches her by capturing Darcy's aristocratic demeanor and his inner conflict nicely. Together they make a couple that emphasizes the youthfulness and relative inexperience of Austen's creations far more than was the case in any of the previous filmizations--which makes the tale not only more credible but somehow more poignant. Their excellence doesn't stand alone; the supporting cast is superb, too, with Donald Sutherland wonderfully unruffled and sardonic as the put-upon Mr. Bennet and Brenda Blethyn keeping his wife--an unsophisticated woman obsessed with finding husbands for her many daughters, and a character that can easily become an irritation--within bounds. Rosamund Pike and Simon Woods make an appealing pair as the secondary couple in the mix, Elizabeth's easily-hurt elder sister Jane and Darcy's more ebullient friend Bingley, and Jena Malone is suitably flighty as the immature Lydia, whose infatuation with the handsome but unreliable Wickham (an appropriately smooth Rupert Friend) causes not only a Bennet family crisis but an opportunity that in time will lead to the resolution of the Elizabeth-Darcy impasse. If one can raise any qualifications about the casting, they'd have to concern Tom Hollander, who gives the stiff, obsequious Collins more of a conventionally comic tone than some might wish, and Judi Dench, whose Lady de Bourgh might seem too much the usual intrusive cameo(and whose final scene isn't ideally staged). But you easily become acclimated to them, and in the end they fit Wright's conception. <br />In fact, when looked at as a whole, there's something just a bit miraculous about how enjoyable Wright's film is. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" may be the same old story about finding Mr. Right, but this movie shows that if your take on the familiar tale is sufficiently deft, it can be as fresh and enchanting as Austen's book itself must have been in 1813.

B000A0GP4K|4.0|I have watched this DVD 3 times since I bought it and still find something new and interesting each time I watch it.  Bob Dylan's life and work are incredible, and this documentary shows an important time in history, both musically and politically.  This doesn't white wash or make Dylan look like something he is not, and that he never was - he is not a God, a Saint or a Hero, rather Dylan was and is a brillant, observant and complicated artist.  I highly recommend this DVD;I only wish I'd bought the DVD verison with the book inside....
0783226845|5.0|Here is a movie in which one scene captures all. Life is made of moments and what lies beneath these moments. Having said that, I will now go on and on about the tango scene, which is five minutes of film worth more than my entire DVD collection. <br />The Colonel approaches the lovely Gabrielle Anwar, charms her to the ballroom floor, controls the pace with passion and elegance, and truly, completely enjoys himself; the only time in the film. The tango ends in an ovation from the crowd, but for the Colonel and also for Anwar and Charlie it is bitterseet.  <br />The Colonel's smile slowly shifts to a painful, confused look. He must once again face his demons. Al Pacino is God.   <br />Anwar seems dazzled similar to the crowd; however, she demonstrates a bewildered presence that may be pity, confusion, admiration, or maybe some tragedy related to her own life. Her brief role here was fantastic. Charlie is the happy-go-lucky chap and gives balance to this perfect but awkward meeting. He, as we know, has the \\"weight of the world\\" on his shoulders. You sense he is growing fond of the Colonel. So we have three strangers and a tango all tangled up. I love this scene and I love this movie. <br /> <br />
0375507256|5.0|Every so often I read a good book, and then mentally file it away in my brain under \\"Good Books.\\"  Cloud Atlas is the first book I have read in a long time (years) that is not just *good* but so good that I have to go around telling people that they simply must read it.  For the first time in my life, the second I finished this book, I immediately turned back to the beginning to start reading it again.  (And yes, I loved it even more the second time.)  After I finished it the second time I even considered reading it again, but decided instead to re-read Satanic Verses to see if Cloud Atlas should surpass it as my #1 favorite book.   <br /> <br />The book takes on a very original six-part structure, consisting of six separate novellas with different narrators.  The first five novellas are essentially split in half, the first halves being told in chronological order, an entire novella marking the center, and then the second halves of the novella being told in reverse chronological order.  If you like books that play with structure, I think you'll find this quite lovely.  Other people have described this book as a \\"puzzle,\\" with each narration adding a bit more to understanding the overall story, even though the individual novellas are quite different.  This is why the book is completely re-readable.   <br /> <br />The first novella is the story of Adam Ewing, a priggish voyager on the high seas, traveling in colonialist times.  The language here is a bit thick, reminding me of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, although it isn't without humor.  I'll admit that this was a bit of a barrier to get \\"into\\" the book, and it might be something you want to start when you have a lot of time, not when you want an airplane read.   The second novella tells the story Robert Frobisher, composer and 1930s badass (my favorite of Mitchell's characters).  Frobisher instigates a parasitic relationship with an admired composer, becoming his amanuensis (yes, actual usage of that word!)  Frobisher is delightfully conceited, the talenteder-than-thou artist type with occasional flashes of raw honesty that are endearing.  Next we move on to Timothy Cavendish, a crotchety old ne'er-do-well running a vanity publishing company who eventually finds himself trapped in an odd situation.  Half Lives, the next novella, tells the story of a reporter at a tabloid who gets entangled in a dangerous intrigue in the 1970s. The Orison of Somni 251, which follows, is a very 1984 futuristic narration with tons of fun diction (i.e. \\"corporacy\\").  The only novella not to be split in half is Sloosha's Crossin', which, yes, is written entirely in some sort of vernacular, which is slightly maddening, but when you get used to it, makes you realize that the attention Mitchell plays to diction is impressive.  In many ways, this part of the book was the most engaging-while there are tons of 1984 type stories out there, rarely do we hear about what happens afterwards.  It played out on the almost universal cultural story of societies rising, then falling, then starting to be rebuilt all over again.  Then Mitchell goes back and finishes out each novella in reverse chronological order, which crazily enough, structurally made sense, and was played out in a way which made the themes of the book resonate.   <br /> <br />Read this book.  Please.  You've never read anything before like it.  Even though it is a massive book (530 pages) dealing with a complicated structure, multiple narrators, a larger overarching story (all handled well, by the way), it was really the little things that made love it.  Narrators that rang true.  Humorous writing.  Amazing attention to diction.  I particularly loved how the last part of the book closed on a theme which was simple, but handled beautifully. I'm very much looking forward to reading Mitchell's other novels.  <br />
B000CPH9I4|4.0|This is a very sweet album that you can sit back and relax too.The vocals are beautiful and the instrumentals great. Unfortunatly the lead singer has become rather greedy. I always enjoyed the duet chorus's, but in this there are few and if there is one the others have raspy little voices that require the sterio to be really loud before it's heard. The Corrs just arn't the Corrs on this album, it's nice and all but there really are no songs that drag you in and make you want to cry or dance. All there albums before this are amazing and I recomend you buy those before this. It's good, but they can do way better.

B0002VYQ2U|4.0|At the time of this writing, there is an option to buy this Deluxe Edition at the \\"club price\\" of $7.99. I happen to own the club edition, and I never bought the original CD, so I didn't end up buying most of the music twice.  <br /> <br />What you get over the non-Deluxe original release is three extra songs and a bonus DVD. The DVD is pleasant, with four performances from a Madrid concert and two music videos. Also included is a 17-minute Norah Jones interview. All of this is non-essential, in my opinion, although Norah's live version of the Gram Parsons song She is a great addition to her expanding repertoire of country-tinged material.  <br /> <br />On the audio CD, two of the three bonus cuts also have a country flavor. Moon Song is superior to those two. It is a sweet little tune that should have been on the original release, as a bookend  to Sunrise. Why wasn't it?  <br /> <br />Oddly, the sound quality of the bonus cuts is more brilliant, dynamic, and immediate than the cuts from the orignal CD release. Puzzling. You may not notice, but careful listening will reveal that this is true.  <br /> <br />Norah's debut was not exactly jazz. But it was more jazz-influenced than Feels Like Home, which tilts toward the folk and country side of the musical spectrum. I cannot give this album five stars for that reason. Norah's talents are greater in the jazz-influenced arena, even though she has an obvious affection for other musical styles as well. I think she would do well to choose more cover songs, rather than originals written by herself and bandmates. They are good songwriters, but not great songwriters. Chances are you'll find yourself getting bored of these tunes quicker than the songs on Come Away With Me. <br /> <br />At the right price, the Deluxe version of the album is the obvious choice. Three extra songs and six videos cannot justify the list price, though.

B00012FXB8|5.0|In the past, I used to watch part of this film, then get bored and stop. The inmates all seemed like one forgettable bunch.    However, watching the assembly version of this film, and watching the DVD extras changed all that.    The added scenes suddenly made the previously faceless inmates into  \\"real\\" people, and this seemed to make all the difference. Suddenly, the very human tragedies that were unfolding as the alien  killed off these people took a more emotional turn for me.    In the end, there is a case to be made that this film and the first alien are the best of the lot (although each film in this quadrilogy are superb examples of the genre) - the dark somber settings, filth, and general darkness of alien 3 emphasized fully the human suffering of the inmates as they died trying vainly to fight the alien. Compared to them, the cardboard character marines in alien 2 were almost cartoonish!    Anyways, a common theme here seems to be of viewers hating the film at first, but then changing their minds after seeing the assembly cut in the quadrilogy editions. I suggest you add this film to your collection, because it is, in its own way, a masterpiece of horror/SF film-making.    Just as in Alien 4, the DVD extras were a treasure trove of intimate details about the movie. In this case, the very frank comments of the staff about the troubles making the movie (The final director, Mr. Fincher, refuses to acknowledge alien 3 up to this day) are put forward for all to view.    I'm not into long expositions, so some spoilers below...    - this movie is about faith #1. the inmates in the prison planet where ripley lands have formed a very weird apocalyptic, fundamentalist religion. however, the film takes great pains to show how useless faith is in the face of the alien abomination, which takes the inmates one by one no matter how brave or full of faith they are.    - this movie is about faith #2. It is about how man (in the fom of an inmate names Golic) can be warped into placing an inhuman alien as his deity because of misplaced perceptions.    - this movie is about bravery and sacrifice. how these bunch of prisoners in the end gave up their lives in an act of very human desperation. they could have waited for the soldiers to come in, but they decided to trap the alien themselves.     - this movie is about the human condition - the grit, the desperation, the blood and sweat and fears of being a frail human being in a cold and uncaring universe.
B00005JOE8|4.0|A mysterious figure known as `V' (Hugo Weaving) begins an assault against England's government led by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt). He saves Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman, from the Fingermen, a covert branch of the government's police force. His first step is to attract the attention of the people and he does this by blowing up the Old Bailey, the symbol of law and justice within England, a system that no longer works. Sutler is outraged and immediately summons a meeting of his inner council, lording over them through a huge video screen. Sutler orders Finch (Stephen Rea), the leader of the police force, to find the perpetrator. As V wears a Guy Fawkes mask throughout, it is difficult to identify him, so Finch zeroes in on Evey.<br /><br />M for Message<br /><br />\\"V for Vendetta\\", written and produced by the Wachowski Brothers (\\"The Matrix\\" trilogy) and directed by James McTiegue is the latest entry in what I hope will be a continuing trend. We all know Hollywood loves blockbusters. Generally, these films are exercises allowing the filmmakers to trot out all of their tricks. Sort of like the old Mickey Rooney - Judy Garland films. \\"Let's put on a show\\" followed by a huge, elaborate musical in their backyard, or the barn, with great musical numbers, full orchestras, but little rhyme or reason. In today's Hollywood, a new film is the excuse to showcase any new special effects or stunts, showcasing the `talents' of everyone involved. Story? Story is unimportant. \\"Look at all of the cool crap we can blow up. Let's put on a show.\\"<br /><br />With \\"Batman Begins\\" and now \\"V for Vendetta\\" (yes, in Hollywood, two films count as a trend. I would consider \\"Terminator 2\\" part of the trend but that was released too long ago) we see a movement to create blockbusters which also attempt to say something. \\"Vendetta\\" tries to incorporate messages about government control, some of which may be viewed as parables for our current administration.<br /><br />T for Thematic<br /><br />Based on a graphic novel, the author has removed his name from the film because he was unhappy with the thematic changes in the story. His graphic novel was created with a critical eye towards Margaret Thatcher's Tory government. I have never read the graphic novel, so I can't comment on any changes, but the film seems to be more a critique of the current British and American governments.<br /><br />There are scenes depicting wire tapping, prolonged wars, chemical experiments which may have lead to chemical warfare, spin doctors, government control in the face of paranoia, political talk show hosts and more.<br /><br />V for Visual<br /><br />The film creates an interesting visual universe blending elements of modern design, the Nazis, Big Brother, the 1940s, and \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". These ideas and images blend together far too easily and help create a world which seems a little old fashioned and a little modern. Visually, this works extremely well with the thematic elements, reinforcing the message for every two steps forwards, we take one step back.<br /><br />H for History<br /><br />\\"Vendetta\\" is set in the future, but as historians will tell you those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. The film begins with a prologue depicting the story of Guy Fawkes, the man who attempted to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605. Moving forward more than 400 years, \\"Vendetta\\" begins on November 4 and as soon as the clock strikes midnight, V blows up the Old Bailey.<br /><br />B for Back-story<br /><br />But we have questions and the questions need to be answered. Who is V? How did he come about? What prompted him to begin his current journey? What is Evey's background? How did the Chancellor come to rule Britain with an iron grip? These are important things for us to know, to help make these characters believable and interesting. And the filmmakers realize this importance. A considerable amount of screen time is spent portraying part of these histories; through a series of back stories and montages, we learn these things, adding depth and interest to the story. If you think about it, few dramas made in Hollywood today devote this much time to the back-story, let alone a big budget `action' film.<br /><br />O for Observer<br /><br />At one point, there may be too much back story. Because so much time is devoted to four or five various bits of history, these serve to take us out of the story, making us an observer, not a participant. We almost, not quite but almost disconnect from the story. Just as V expects British citizens to realize they need to stand up and fight for their rights, the filmmakers expect us to participate in the film. Passive observance isn't enough for this film, yet it almost gets that. One of the back stories in particular tests our resolve; it seems unnecessary to learn about a character we never actually meet the person in the film.<br /><br />G for Good<br /><br />Natalie Portman is good as Evey Hammond, the young woman who becomes V's unwitting accomplice. Initially, she is just like every other British citizen; trying to deal with the past while surviving in the present with little overt concern about the future. How does she do this? She tries to forget the past and complacently deal with the present. As she becomes embroiled in Vs plot, she begins to gain strength, to become an ally to the masked man. It is an interesting performance. Throughout a significant portion of the film, her character is imprisoned, tortured or interrogated. After this, she is still not completely committed to V's cause, the transformation continues. It is testament to everyone involved that Evey never becomes a superhero, always remaining a human being. It is her resolve, her persona that must change.<br /><br />H for Hero<br /><br />Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith, \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy) has the most difficult role; behind a mask throughout, he has to create a character without facial expressions. He does this in a manner of ways, through words, body language, and action. His hands and arms, the cock of his head, his voice, all lend to his character. On more than one occasion, he uses riddles to temporarily perplex his foes. At one point, a speech uses seemingly every word beginning with the letter `V'. This verbal exposition provides a unique, fun and interesting dimension to his character.<br /><br />More importantly, Weaving manages to convey the various complexities of his character. Technically, he is an outlaw, but we see the world he lives in, through his eyes, and realize he is more of a hero. Some of his actions may appear severe, but his character is living in desperate times. Desperate times call for desperate measures.<br /><br />S for Support<br /><br />The supporting cast is universally good, providing an interesting level to the film. Stephen Rea is the standout as Finch, the leader of the traditional police. He begins to realize the problems with the current regime, yet still must carryout his job.

You can buy it from Amazon.co.uk for about £7 (US$14.00-ish), but it won't play on Region 1 (North America, US Territories, and Bermuda) DVD players - only on Region 2 (Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt) or a regionless DVD player, which are available to US customers many places online these days.  (Google for \\"regionless dvd player\\".)<br /><br />The UK version even includes a \\"Behind The Scenes\\" featurette, deleted scenes, and the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Why, MCA Home Video, why have you forsaken us?
B000ASDFJU|5.0|This is a wonderful, beautifully packaged series with lots of pictures and stills from the show. I really liked the show too but I wouldn't give it 5 stars. Even though the show deals with many real problems that women face regarding men, like the episode where Miranda was told by one of Carrie's numerous boyfriends that \\"he is just not that into you\\", I cannot relate to any of the characters. I admire Carrie's, Miranda's, Samantha's and Carlotte's friendship but i don't like their life styles in regards to sleeping with as many men as there are in NYC. C'mon now, they are just fancy drassed easy women, to put it in more appropriate words. Their choice in men is rediculous and their conversations often tend to be a bit juvinille. Carrie spends all of her money on shoes and then fails to come up with a downpayment for her appartment and Samantha sleeps with anything male that can walk. Miranda is too cynical and negative and judgmental. Carlotte is the only likable character because of her belief that love and romance still exist and it's not only about sex. I got a bit discouraged at the way modern women are portrayed in the show. They are everything that i do not want to be.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This is a phenomenal gift for the avid Springsteen fan.  The DVD which chronicles the making of the Born to Run album really gives you a true appreciation for the quality that Bruce puts out.  He does not just throw an album together, but truly puts his heart, soul & reputation on the line for his music.  And the CD in my opinion is the best CD he has ever produced!
B000002AGB|3.0|<br /> <br />This recording illustrates the importance of seeing The Who perform, rather than just listening to the recording of a show. Thankfully, the film of this concert, albeit incomplete, is available to buy. <br /> <br />This recording is scrappy compared to Live at Leeds. There is something of a myth that suggests that Live at Leeds was just a typical 'average night' performance by the band. Those that have had the opportunity to listen to the multitude of bootlegs of the period know only too well that they rarely played as well as the Leeds show. The Hull show that followed it illustrated the variability. <br /> <br />Roger Daltrey bemoaned that the on-stage power of The Who's music was never adequately captured on record. The power of the stage show relied on enormous volume and physical impact, along with the spectacle of the performance. It didn't matter that Townshend missed the beat (or sometimes the guitar) as he ricocheted about the place because the visuals and attitude were more important at the time. However, strip things back to a plain audio recording like Live at the Isle of Wight and you hear the mistakes, the out of tune guitar, the dodgy backing vocals and sloppy playing that you wouldn't have noticed on the night. Without the huge volume of the PA system to carry the day the reality of the performance falls rather flat.  <br /> <br />By comparison Live at Leeds is a much better record. It is true that the energy level dips during Tommy, which is principally why the band was always reluctant to release a recording of this section of the show until the 'deluxe' remaster (which stills changes the running order of the show)double CD was produced. Leeds was conceived as a potential live album and the sound and performance was honed accordingly. Isle of Wight was just a spin off movie of the overall event. This IOW CD is an impressive technical salvage job of a scrappy and poorly recorded show. <br /> <br />However, do yourself a favour and buythe DVD to understand why the playing sometimes came off the rails. The Who were about showmanship as much as the music and often the showmanship came first. <br /> <br />
B0000648WZ|3.0|I watch this movie all the time.  It is so stupid, but it is a hoot to watch.  Girl goes right from high school to a short immersion tour at space academy and immediately becomes not only a commissioned officer but a pilot too.  Meanwhile, her highschool boyfriend becomes a field grunt enlisted man.  The gore was really well done.  Denise Richards is hot but never nude.  The shower scene is a turn-on but not necessarily due to the brief nudity but at the idea that the male and female recruits are so matter-of-fact about showering together.  I am embarrassed at giving this really bad, bad film 3 stars, but it is a fun dumb escape on occasion.
B000001FGG|4.0|Wheels Of Fire, Cream's third LP, was released in july of 1968. The album actually consists of two parts, one recorded in studio, and the other one recorded live (though it is desribed as \\"Live In Filmore\\", only Toad was recorded there; other tracks were recorded in Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco). Wheels Of Fire is regarded as Cream's greatest achievment, and while I don't think it's as outstanding as Disraeli Gears, I don't deny it's an excellent album. <br /> <br />The studio part contains some of the finest music Cream ever recorded. Many of songs from this CD became regular concert staples. Let's see how does the studio part measure up. <br /> <br />White Room kicks the things off. This number opens with 5/4 tempo, and haunting cellos and then builds up into a psychodelic rocker. It is noticable that the song borrows riff from earlier Cream tune, Tales Of Brave Ulysess, but despite this it manages to be an original and inspiring track. Then we have Sitting On The Top Of The World, an outstanding Howlin' Wolf cover. Clapton's amazing guitar work and harmonic tempo changes make this one my favourite. Passing The Time is a bit bizzare composition, but definately a creative one. Slow melodic verses turn into hard-rocking repetitive chorus. As You Said is quite chilly, and it features Clapton on acoustic guitar. Pressed Rat And Warthog, definately the weirdest song on the album (and of the weirdest songs of all), is Baker reciting a strange tale about pressed rat and warthog who closed down their shop with a bizzare melody in the background. Things get back to rock with Politician, a strong blues rocker build around a killer riff. Those Were The Days is another psychodelic rocker with some poetry speaking about the ancient times. Born Under A Bad Sign gets things back to blues; this outstanding blues number never fails to please. Deserted Cities Of The Heart finishes the first half of the album and is one of the most underrated Cream songs. It is a Hard guitar-driven tale with emotional lyrics. The moment when Jack Bruce sings \\"Now My heart's drowned in no love strams\\" is so heartbreaking and dark that I sometimes even shed a tear. A masterpiece. <br /> <br />Now the live part, which is mostly stuff for hardcore fans, with the exception of the first track, Crossroads. Every Cream fan knows this song. It is definately one of the most inspiring numbers in rock history. Clapton shows his mastery of blues guitar, and Bruce and Baker show why they are the most underrated rhytm section in the history! They do incredible jamming during the solo breaks. If I would have to pick my one favourite Cream song, this may be it. <br />Spoonful, stretching to nearly 17 minutes, features some jamming, which, I have to admit, becomes quite boring after a few listens. Traintime is Bruce-Baker duo, with Baker playing the drums and Bruce handling vocals and harmonica. Some may say this song drags on a bit too long, but I like it. It's a good track to listen from time to time. The closing Toad is Ginger Baker showing his abilities on the drums. The song lasts for 16 minutes and the major part of it is a drum solo, but for a hardcore Cream fan, like me, this is something to listen and enjoy. Ginger Baker is one of the most underrated drummers ever, and here he proves it. His solo on drums is creative and inspiring, and it's good to give it a listen. <br /> <br />Wheels Of Fire is a great album, but I don't think it's the band's best. My favourite still remains Disraeli Gears, but WOF is a must have for any Cream fan. If You want to start Your experience with Cream, don't do it with this album - get Disraeli Gears. Still, WOF remains a classic and is a must have for any fan who digs Cream or classic rock, in general.
B0000214F0|5.0|Incredible!  Highly recommend doing an online search of Caligula and reading about his life and short rule before you watch the movie. I went to Google and entered \\"Caligula\\" and immediately was able to read a short one or two page bio on him. If you plan on asking your wife or girlfriend watch with you, she may appreciate the movie more rather than thinking it is just porn if you ask her to read your research too. It is VERY EXPLICIT, however it is obvious the maker of this film was trying to portray Caligula Caesar's life as historically acurate as possible. Somethings are just so graphically portrayed...
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|I was wrong.... <br /> <br />when I first saw previews for Chicken Little in the cinema and on television I was less than impressed with the animation having become used to the clean lines and slick coloring of previous Pixar releases. I thought the titular character looked wrong somehow (the oversized head maybe) and was at that point turned off viewing the movie alltogether. <br /> <br />The kids persisted however and I relented and wasn't dissapointed that we took them to see it on the big screen. I did not expect the cross pollination with War of the worlds, Independence day and just a smidgen of Finding Nemo in the storyline and that the little guy would turn out to be so resourcefull and have such a big heart. <br /> <br />The animation may not have been as polished as what we have seen in the past but worked well in context and did not distract from the film at all and was in fact better than what I had initally expected. <br /> <br />The undelying story of following your instincts and doing what you believe despite the doubts of those who's approval you crave was great and as the father of four I am well aware of how easy it is to want to protect your children and can understand how the father became overprotective after the inital sky is falling incident. Of course the importance of finding the faith in your child and giving them enough freedom to learn and grow and ultimatly succeed under thier own steam cannot be underscored and that is the true meaning at the heart of the story. <br /> <br />The movie also has humor in it's favor and though it may not be as clever as say a Shrek it's the sort of humor that the kids appreciate and can understand. The scene when chicken little belts out we are the champions is a highlight for kids and grownups alike. <br /> <br />The DVD was quite a few nifty features with alternative beginnings rather than the usual alternate endings, a making off documentary,music video's from the films soundtrack, karaoke sing along anda trivia game. <br /> <br />All in all Chicken little is a hit and good value for the whole family. <br /> <br />
B000E33VWW|5.0|When he held aloft the Oscar for \\"Best Actor\\" -- at this year's Academy Awards show -- Phil Hoffman didn't have any time (in a 60-second acceptance speech) to recall the  pleasures of filming \\"Capote\\" here, in \\"the world's coldest major city\\" (according to the American consular service).<br /><br />Winnipeggers fully understood. We're accustomed to this -- a collective cross we must bear - along with consecutive weeks of 30 below temperatures in winter, (compensated-for in summer by a deserved reputation as `mosquito capitol' of North America).<br /><br />And we've served as backdrop to some major Hollywood films lately. Before \\"Capote\\" for instance, \\"Shall We Dance\\" was almost entirely filmed here (including all interior scenes).  But then (as always) Winnipeggers searched in vain for recognition, beyond a line in the closing credits. (There was however a fleeting reference-or-two in the \\"Shall We Dance\\" DVD commentary track from director Peter Chelsom.)<br /><br />But there's joy in Mudville this day (March 21) --  for the just-released DVD version of \\"Capote\\" - with its warmly expressed appreciation for \\"Winterpeg.\\"<br /><br />[This city's previous claim-to-fame on American TV screens? An episode of  \\"The Simpsons\\" -- spoofing \\"internet pharmacies\\" all of which seemed to be based in this city of 700,000 -- and where the \\"Highway 59, `Welcome\\" sign on Winnipeg's outskirts claimed to declare in defiance to rare visitors: \\"We were BORN here - What's YOUR excuse?\\"]<br /><br />----<br /><br />But hey -- it's the `look' of Winnipeg that made it the perfect setting for this great film! In the DVD's accompanying documentary, \\"Making Capote,\\" producer Caroline Baron says that the city and the 'endless prairie' appearance of surrounding farmland and towns, was simply ideal.<br /><br />\\"We were obviously looking,\\" says Ms Baron, \\"for some place economical to shoot, but (which) also had that look of Kansas in the late 50s and early 60s . . . AND that also could double for New York City and Brooklyn at that time - a tall order for (any one) city - and amazingly Winnipeg had that look!<br /><br />\\"The downtown (has) been preserved -- and the towns around it (are) preserved so well . . . we were able to shoot almost the entire film in-and-around Winnipeg.\\"<br /><br />Director Bennett Miller, who shares the commentary track along with his Best Actor Oscar-winner Hoffman, enthused about the local actors and extras who made the most of their moment-of-fame:<br /><br />\\"We found some great faces! 90-percent of the people in this movie came from within a five-mile radius of downtown Winnipeg.<br /><br />\\"We found an amazing local casting director Jim Heber who probably brought more than a thousand people to be considered as extras!  So every single face (you see) was `selected.' If you see a face in this movie -- they were chosen!\\"<br /><br />[Heber told a reporter for the Winnipeg Free Press newspaper, \\"It's very nice to be appreciated (in this way).  You know, when you're making a `masterpiece' of the American cinema . . .  you have to have `due diligence'.\\"]<br /><br />On a separate commentary track (with his cinematographer Adam Kimmel) Director Bennett Miller expressed an appreciation bordering on awe -- for the way Winnipeggers stood in line for hours, in order to comprise the audience at a local theatre for a scene in which the film's Oscar winner Phil Hoffman reads passages of \\"In Cold Blood\\" to a (depicted) Manhattan audience.<br /><br />\\"It's one of those shots,\\" said Miller, \\"that makes me think back very affectionately towards Winnipeg and its people.\\"<br /><br />----<br /><br />After speaking of his personal difficulties in `nailing' the part of Truman Capote during the first week of filming, (\\"That's me thinking, How the hell am I going to get through this movie?\\") Phil Hoffman endearingly points out the appearance of Winnipeg's gift to ballet - prima ballerina Evelyn Hart -- in a party scene:  \\"The one on the right (there) is avery famous choreographer,\\" he says - before director Bennett Miller corrects him on Hart's profession: \\"(She's a) Ballerina,\\" says Miller. \\"Allison Hart? Do I have it right? EVELYN Hart! From the Royal Winnipeg Ballet.\\"<br /><br />Big smiles at that one but . . . there'll be no \\"price break\\" for us - except at Amazon.com.

B000E97HIA|4.0|....let me explain the title    Most would know the deal with the brilliant marketing premise behind this release of sending seven fans for a private show at Prince's home (which bye the bye is terrifically displayed pictorially in the booklet that comes with the CD the man knows what he likes)..... anyway with the Golden ticket on the plastic wrap and the visit to Prince's world up for grabs images of the magical Wonka bars with the golden ticket inside came to mind and when I opened the CD and took out the booklet and saw that something else was enclosed within I thought I was on my way to Paisley Park. Alas it was no more than an advertisment for Prince's latest protege Tamar and so Paisley Park remains out of reach.    Thankfully the dissapointment did not last because I started listening to the music and all was forgiven. With 3121 Prince continues to build on the sucess of his 2004 comeback with Musicology and has delivered another disk that will have his old school fans enraptured and will also no doubt add some new fans to the fold.    3121 is a slow jam psychedelic funky romp that dispels any notion that Prince's devout belief in Jehovah will tame his partying ways....    This is further exemplified with the following track Lolita which is a catchy as all get out and to me sounds like the love child of Pussy Control and Love to the 9's and is one of the standout songs on the album.....    Ti Amo Corazon brings the pace back down with it's lush production and Spanish influence it has a terrific atmosphere....    Of course there's no time to relax when it's time to get the funk out again for Black Sweat which was performed so well on SNL and is currently recieving plenty of airtime on the radio. It is classic Prince and I predict will be a tour staple for years to come.....    Incense and Candles reins things in again a little with it's softer strings though Prince does kick out a rap midpoint.....    \\"Ohhhhh\\" the Prince alternative to Micheal Jackson's \\"c'mon\\" opens Love and it's been too long since we heard it with ommph and agression like this. Good synth and drum underneath this one keep the jam moving to make a solid track....    Satisified is Prince back in the bedroom (check out the artwork in the booklet) and is classic Prince seduction mode. Satisfactorally so......    The other track from SNL was of course Fury which went over as strong as Black sweat and is a good upbeat jam with a killer rhythm and some nice guitar licks holding it all together. Hopefully Prince keeps the ripping guitar solo from SNL in his live performances because he let himself go a little more SNL than he has in the studio....    I'm not sure what The Word is but I don't like the sound of those spider's spinning their webs around us all sounds kinda scary....this is one of the most interesting songs on the album lyrically and musically. Nice loop reverberates throughout and listen in stereo and you can notice how the vocals move from speaker to speaker. Maybe the best song on the album for me....    Beautiful,loved and blessed is another slower song that features Tamar on lead vocals. It's ok but no standout, maybe it needs a few more listens....    The dance is underpinned by a nice piano and is sung with a mournfull heartache which I would not have expected given the title and the albums tendency to go from up to down tempo I was expecting something with more zing following BL&B...given that this is a better song than BL&B I have no regrets.....    Get up, get on up, get up, get on up....that is James Brown's sex machine in case you didn't recognise it.....that's what Get on the boat made me think of at first listen.....it swings it's funky and it definatly hits the right note to close the album out....lot's of horns, sax and drums keeps it grooving and at over six minutes makes for a good party jam Listen for the groove it, groove it fade out at the end.....    So all in all while a Wonka Bar might taste good and offer momentary satisfaction for a sweet tooth it can't compare to an album full of great new Prince beats even if said album didn't hold the golden ticket.
B00002E224|5.0|This is the perfect love story. It explores the interactions of two strangers with such honesty and realism, all in the beautiful Venice landscape. It strips away all the special effects and over the top features of main stream romances and gets real. Give this film a chance to reach into your heart.

B00005JMAH|5.0|I hadn't read any of the Harry Potter books until I saw this movie. I watched the first two in the movie theatre and thought that they were very childish and shallow, though fun at times and certainly worth the time. <br />But when I saw Prisoner of Azkaban I finally came to realize what Harry Potter is about. It's not just about magic and stairs cases moving around and 'what you would imagine a magical school to be like', its a complex story about three wonderful characters. This movie may leave out some of the plot points that I have come to appreciate now that I have read all of the books, and yes I think it might have done well to at least show the stag coming in the second Patronus scene, although you can actually make out the antlers coming out of the cloud so its not like they inexplicably forgot all about it. I think they just had to make sure they covered up Harry completely which is harder to do in a movie than in a book, even though they did defocus the first scene across the lake, as if framing from Harry's point of view as he passes out. And i also think that they could have made the connection to Harry's father, although Black's final speech to Harry about 'those who we love remain inside of us' is still stirring and not inappropriate at all. It is also much better coming from Sirius than Dumbledore (who makes the speech in the book) because Sirius is the one who really knew James and Lilly and misses them so much. <br />I've seen Goblet of fire a number of times and I can recognize that the director of that film - Mike Newell - was impressed by Cuaron's cinematography and tried to incorporate that into his film, all the while remaining oblivious to what really made Cuaron's movie a master piece and by FAR the best movie yet. Cuaron got wonderful performances out of the main three, particularly in the emotional scenes mostly shared by Harry and Hermione. I'm sure that the actors who play the main trio are extremely talented, but they are also so young,and they clearly respond strongly to the director's comments which is why they have very different performances under the three directors. <br />Mike Newell went for the semi-serious teenage boarding school approach which resulted in very static portrayals of the main three. This is especially apparent with Hermione who hardly seems to escape from a perpetual bad mood. Did the director forget that Hermione, although certainly high strung at times, is also so kind and helpful to Harry, and when the chips are down, and Harry is in so much danger, the beauty of her character emerges. She no longer cares about rules, and school and lessons and 'cleverness' she just cares about her friends. Which is no doubt why she is in Gryfindor and not ravenclaw. Getting back to the PoA, Hermione is exactly how she is in the book. <br />The cinematography truly is beautiful in the PoA, but so is the character direction, the innovation of the magical world and even the depth of the story. When Peter Petigrew speaks to Sirius and Remus about Voldemort, we can feel a real sense of dread and history. We see the landscape of Hogwarts, how it is a school of the outdoors as well as of classrooms and hidden chambers. When Harry flies on the Hippogriff we feel his sense of freedom and his desire to escape the prison of the Dursley's as well as the isolation brought from being 'the boy who lived'. It is subtle, there isn't narrative to fill in the gaps or unnecessary dialogue. The film works as a film. It uses sight and sound as well as feeling and dialogue to show us the hearts of the characters which is what I think Harry Potter is about. This films shows us WHY Harry can be the one to defeat Voldemort. Because he is this normal person who has friends and who loves them and whom he equally relies upon for love. <br />The other movies just go through the motions. <br />But there are still three movies to go, and many more brilliant moments to take advantage of, but they need a more talentedfilm director than Mike Newell to capture them as well as Cuaron. Why not bring Cuaron back?
B000E97Y6A|5.0|All this new wave technology...it amazes me. Peter Jackson has shown off his good directing in brilliant films such as LOTR trilogy. This one has so much more, you'll be doing all sorts of things in the theater: laughing, crying, and even leaving for a bathroom break! The movie runs at about three hours and ten minutes. Some scenes are extremely boring, yes, but he makes up for them after showing King Kong. In this movie, King Koong is a little more emotional, considering they can make him on a computer now. He gets angry, laughs, and even cries. The film follows Ann Darrow, whose job as an entertaining actress suddenly ends after her theater is closed down. She is soon confronted by Carl Denham, who is trying to make it big in the movie business, but his main girl ran out on him. When Ann agrees to shoot a movie with him on a mysterious island, they are spotted by the people of this supposedly \\"uncharted\\" island. Once these creepy people abduct Ann, she is made into food for their leader, Kong. But then Kong realizes how much she loves him. It's basically just like the original, with some new twists and new added material you won't be expecting. The film overall was one of the best films I have ever seen.

B000EHRVP6|3.0|I must admit, Hostel had amazing effects. The before-and-after of the people being tortured were simply billiant. However, the movies isn't as advertised. It isn't very scary; no jumpy scenes. It's just like pornography the first forty-five minutes of it, as the guys explore what Amsterdam has to offer them. The,n they stumble upon two girls, who end up being apart of the plan. I think it's nice how it all unravels to where everybody they met were involved in this torture somehow, but what it's about doesn't really fit the screenplay: The movie summarized is about a bunch of college guys going to Amsterdam looking for a good time, and end up being part of a legal torture chamber where people pay to torture helpless, innocent victims. To me, the movie is mostly on the good time in Amsterdam subject. The,n it gets gruesome. Overall, I found the movie average, but the make-up effects above-average; brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

B0006A9FMI|5.0|It is a sad thing, but `Innocence' was not a big commercial hit in Japan where I live despite its wide theatrical release in this country and promotions involving one major convenience store company. But this may not be surprising. Oshii Mamoru's world is made of his philosophy about the cyber world that was also seen in his previous film `Ghost in the Shell,' and he pushed it further in this rivetting sequel of which visuals refuse to be boring, not even a second.  <br /> <br />As the \\"Major\\" Kusanagi has disappeared into the vast world of cyber space, it is Bat and Togusa who play the central roles in the investigation of bizarre murder cases. To be frank with you, in spite of the fierce gun-fights with yakuza and robots, their investigation has no big mystery from the start, and director Oshii is well aware of the fact. In other words, don't follow the story. The film is not about that. It is about its breathtaking visuals and Oshii's own idea about cyborgs. <br /> <br />Even those who is not impressed with the film's thin story would admit the stunning visuals and mesmerizing soundtracks. The production designs are directed by Yohei Taneda, the Japanese designer who made the set of `Aobaya' for Tarantino in `Kill Bill Vol.1.' The soundtrack by Kenji Kawai, especially the fantastic chorus part, perfectly matches the visuals to create the metropolis of the other world.  <br /> <br />The unique but credible world of `Innocence' is based on Oshii's interest in dolls and marionettes in general. Bat, robot detective and Togusa family man co-exist in the same section of the police, and to solve the case they have to cross the line that divides the humans and non-humans. In Oshii's world, the line between them is very thin, or non-existent, and it is suggested that robots can claim love from another - robot or human. <br /> <br />The theme may sound peculiar, but in fact it is not so. (`Blade Runner' is always quoted to tell you this obvious fact.) What is unique about the film is the amount of ideas quoted from philosophy and literature. You don't usually see the characters cite the words from the Bible and Milton as if it is nothing. Even in the original language which I heard, the information given through the dialogues amount to the level that requires repeated viewings, and if you are watching it with subtitles, and think that you cannot follow perfectly what Bat and his sidekick are talking about, remember that that kind of trouble also happened to me. Of course, that doesn't mean the complaints about the subtitles heard in the previous reviews are not justified. <br /> <br />So keep watching it even if you don't understand some part of it. Enjoy the visuals and for those who still remember the relations between Bat and The Major Kusanagi, yes, she comes back though briefly. That brief moment is perhaps better than the long conclusion of the Matrix trilogy, though.

B000AM6OK8|5.0|This 1978 release from The Stones offers an impressive variety of styles, from their take on disco in the sublime Miss You to the humorous country of Far Away Eyes to the rock balladry of Beast Of Burden. Not many Stones albums offer such a variety of musical styles.<br /><br />The rock tracks are tough and uncompromising, like the decadent When The Whip Comes Down, the acidic title track and the anthemic Before They Make Me Run. They also do a brilliant cover of the Temptations' classic Just My Imagination, giving it a much rawer soul sound.<br /><br />It is clear that this album was a response to Punk and Disco, the two styles prevalent from the mid 1970s to the end of that decade. Without a doubt the Stones pulled it off very well as the aforementioned Miss You was a huge hit and has stood the test of time very well: it's mid-tempo dance track with subdued vocals, lovely ooh-ooh choruses and a genuine nightlife feel.<br /><br />The country song Far Away Eyes is equally mesmerising, as Mick sings in a real country accent about a truck driver on the way to visit his girlfriend while listening to a gospel station. Although it's a parody, I find it very charming and very \\"genuine\\" in another sense. It was the flipside of Miss You and probably contributed to this seven single reaching Number One.<br /><br />The songs are uniformly good with great tunes and plenty of attitude. Some Girls may not be considered as one of their top 5 classics of all time but I find myself returning to it again and again. Some Girls is a solid body of work with many highlights.

Overall great show, the crowd was really into it, although this is more evident on the cd's IMO.  I only have two minor objections: 1- MORE BASS!!! kinda quiet. 2- Editing, looks like a toddler on caffine edited it. <br /> <br />Overall Great!

0790729369|3.0|This movie is interesting to watch mostly due to the acting--Meryl Streep is stunning in her portrayal of this character--exhibiting the mannerisms of both an native born Italian who has lived in Iowa for 20 years and has worked as a career homemaker.  Streep completely inhabits this role.  Eastwood is also competent as a supporting actor, playing the lover with ease--an unusual role for him.<br /><br />I watched this because I am watching all of Eastwoods movies.  I really don't enjoy tragic love stories--I think I saw Cyrano de Bergerac too many times when I was younger and I get impatient with people who are nobly self-sacrificial and don't seize their opportunity to be with their soul mate.<br /><br />For me the initial romance was mildly entertaining, but the resulting drama was not.

B000E8QVWY|4.0|I am not a country music fan nor was I familiar with the music of Johnny and June Carter Cash. What I am is a Reese Witherspoon fan. I fell in love with her when she was thirteen years old in MAN IN THE MOON. So, that is what got me interested in seeing this film (not to mention the constant publicity both before and during the Oscars). Now I am Joaquin Phoenix fan as well after seeing this great movie. The acting is phenomenal and I can't say enough about the singing. Both performances are awesome. It is hard to believe that these two actors portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter are not already professional musicians.  <br />I enjoyed the movie although grew weary of all the scenes of Johnny as a drug addict. Surely he had some redeeming qualities; why else would the adorable June fall in love with him? I am afraid that now the image I have of this man in black is of a man high on drugs and I know there was more to him than that. Granted, this movie only covers his childhood to 1968. Perhaps a sequel with a lot of music-- I might become a country music fan!
B0007SMD3W|4.0|Lovely to hear a first rate re-master of a classic disc! \\"from genesis to revelation\\" is a must have for all true Genesis fans. The songs are soothing,gentle, inquisitive, challenging, provocative, moving. Very melodic with a fine mix of arrangement from sparse instrumentation to lush string accompaniment. Gabriels' voice is amazing at this young age. Searching, sensitive, bold! The first disc is true to the original album along with the art design. As a rule I am generally averse to much of the bonus material offered on re-masters. Thankfully all the bonus stuff is on the 2nd ,separate disc. I'll confess I only played it once, but my overall impression was that it detracted rather than attracted. Rough sketches that ultimately interfere with your appreciation of the finished masterpiece. That said I still implore the serious fan to get this important piece of rock history.
0141439807|5.0|After recently viewing a film based on a Jane Austen novel, I was left wanting the real thing, not a lightweight, fluffy adaptation that only slightly resembled the original.  I wanted something beautifully written with some meat!  I have read my beloved Jane Austen's other books many, many times; P & P doesn't even have a kiss yet to me, is the most romantic book I have ever read.  But I had not, I'm ashamed to say ever read MANSFIELD PARK.  I saw the wonderful movie when it came out several years ago and really enjoyed it.  Of course, after having read the book, there are some major differences--see the movie first so you have nothing to compare it to!<br /><br />The reviews that have been written preceding this one are all astounding-- written poignantly and exquisitely by my fellow Jane Austen aficionados.  Some of you all could be authors yourselves.  But I will try to write some of my own musings about this wonderful book.<br /><br />MANSFIELD PARK is not a romance although it does have my 'happily ever after' ending.  It is really a biography of Miss Fanny Price, a young girl who is fortuitously taken in by her wealthy Aunt and Uncle, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram to their large estate, Mansfield Park.  The ten year-old child has left her poor, low class ineffectual parents and their large brood of children in a small, unorganized and filthy home.  Fanny never felt love at home (with the exception of her beloved older brother William) and she has been transplanted to a place that is the polar opposite.  Her new home is magnificent and everything is quiet and orderly.  Fanny is miserable but is saved by the attentions of her adored moral, sanctimonious but very kind cousin, Edmund.  Since Fanny is so painfully shy, she spends most of her day observing everyone else's behavior.  And, with Edmund's influence, Fanny, although very sweet and innocent does have a tendency to be 'holier than thou!'  Miss Price becomes the sole companion to her Aunt Bertram, a sweet, but shallow woman who has to ask her husband if she is hungry.  Fanny's other Aunt Norris is cruel and really contributes to her low self-esteem (as we call it today).<br /><br />Austen always paints pictures of the most quirky and delicious characters.  There is the superficial developmentally delayed Mr. Rushworth who is engaged to Fanny's cousin, Maria.  I laughed out loud reading about this man trying to learn even one line for the play.  There are the Crawford siblings who are not only attractive but seem to always be the life of the party with their charming personalities.  I could go on and on but just know that Jane Austen does a wonderful job with her character development.  Each person has such distinctive qualities that we all know people like that in real life, today, two hundred years later!<br /><br />I really think of Fanny as a duckling who turns into a beautiful swan.  She starts her life as a shy, mousy, introverted little girl who never feels quite at home.  Her face is rarely seen without a blush.  She then grows into a lovely, confident young lady who develops quite a backbone.  During her three months at Plymouth she realizes that her home and all the people she dearly loves are part of her beloved Mansfield Park<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewers when they say that this book is a little more difficult to get into.  For people just starting Austen, read her other novels first and then go to this one.  Give it a few chapters and I promise that you won't be able to put it down.
B0007XT7V8|4.0|This is the second album from Theory of a Deadman, a Canadian rock band with a large following that includes video game and wrestling fans as well as rock music lovers everywhere.  Their popularity has led to two nominations for Juno Awards in April 2006, for \\"Group of the Year\\" and \\"Rock Album of the Year\\".<br /><br />There are several buzz-worthy tracks on this album, my favorite being \\"Santa Monica\\", which is the track chosen for the Juno Awards 2006 CD.  Others are first single \\"No Surprise\\"; \\"Hello Lonely (Walk Away From This)\\"; \\"Better Off\\" and \\"Say Goodbye\\".  The other tracks are mostly your standard rock fare with lots of guitars and drums, but good listening of you're in the mood to rock.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 21, 2006

It was just disappointing that the help he received he denied in the end.

B000E6ESL2|5.0|I, like a lot of people, found this movie to be amazing and extremely thought-provoking. The cinematography was very creative, and the acting was fantastic. I have to say, the dialogue was a little flat, but, other than that, it was one of the best movies that I saw last year. I blame its lack of success on both the horrible, almost non-existent marketing (which is strange for a movie with such a well-known cast), as well as a lot of people's apathy towards movies that require them to think and analyze. I suspect a lot of people who saw this told their friends that it was \\"bad\\" simply because they didn't get it. I will definitely be buying the DVD when it comes out on March 28.

006056251X|4.0|I must say I fell in love with Kleypas' novel Dreaming of You and, while it is still my favorite (how can you not love Derek and Sara?!) this is a close second!<br /><br />For starters the charaters are simply delightful. Sebastian reminds me of a cross between Derek Craven and James Bond (that whole suave I'm-so-hot-and-you-know-it attitude of his!). In fact, I was totally excited when a certain character mentions to Evie that Sebastian reminded him of someone else in another famous club long ago. I was grinning since I thought the same, and of course, any comparison with Derek is ok in my book. Evie is a sweetheart. I'm so glad Ivo's daugther got her own story and paired with the terrible Lord St Vincent no less. She reminds me a bit of Sarah as well so for me this book is and their pairing is nothing short of perfect.<br /><br />The plot is very well thought out. Evie has been brought up by her late mother's horrible relatives who enjoy nothing more than beating and abusing the hell out of poor Evie. Her father, Ivo Jenner (Derek's club rival in Dreaming of You) is dying and her relatives will not let her see him. Instead they make plans to wed her to one of her cousins so they can keep all the fortune she will inherit from Ivo. Horrified at the idea she decided she needs to marry and soon and she comes up with a brilliant plan: to run away, marry the terrible Lord St Vincent and then take care of her dying father.<br /><br />Sebastian Lord St Vincent is as bad as they come. His aim in life is to please himself and he does a darn good job of it! Of course it helps a lot that he is beyond gorgeous (a fact that he knows all too well - modesty is not one of his better traits lol) and women practically fall at his feet everywhere he goes. While he does have the title, he is in desperate need of finding a rich heiress to marry since he has one foot in the poor house (although his lifestyle would make anyone think otherwise but that's the way he wants it). So when Evie turns up at his house one night and offers a marriage of convenience he has no choice but to accept (or there goes the lifestyle he is used to).<br /><br />Evie knows about his debauched reputation so as part of their agreement she establishes one rule: they will sleep together on their wedding night to consumate the marriage but never again after that. She doesn't want to fall in love because she is sure he can't be faithful and will break her heart. She figures once married she can go take care for her ailing father and he can do as he pleases, all she wants is freedom to be able to be by her dad's side.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the story and the interaction between Evie and Sebastian. One of my all time favorite pairs!<br /><br />One other thing about this book is the character of Cam. He is simply adorable and I loved his brotherly relationship with Evie. I loved his interaction with Daisy (the last of the wallflowers) and I was beyond excited thinking they would be the final pair in the Wallflowers series but alas, it seems that was just to throw us off since in Mrs Kleypas site it mentions her and a certain Matthew as the basis of her next book. I have to say I was extremely dissapointed since Daisy and Cam just completely set off fireworks in the brief moment they interacted. I would LOVE to see Cam get his own story. His character is amazing. He is so in control of himself and yet he has such mystic, so much to explore! After Derek and Sebastian he is my favorite Kleypas hero, even if he is a secondary character.<br /><br />I can just hope that Mrs Kleypas feels as strongly about him and decides to gift us with his story as well.<br /><br />Wonderful book, read it and you won't regret it!en Evie turns up at his house one night and offers a marriage of convenience he has no choice but to accept (or there goes the lifestyle he is used to).  <br /> <br />Evie knows about his debauched reputation so as part of their agreement she establishes one rule: they will sleep together on their wedding night to consumate the marriage but never again after that.

B000BO0LLS|4.0|First of all let me say that the service of Amazon was excellent, and I was very saticfied. <br /> <br />About the product itself, I absolutely love Mariah, I think the songs are great, and the dvd too. <br /> <br />What i didn't like is the fact that she didn't put the personal interview with her as part of the DVD, you can only see it on the web.  <br />I installed all that was necessary, in order to see it on the internet, and it didn't work. and to be honest that was the only reason I bought it. If not, i would just have bought the regular cd in store, instead of ordering it from abroad (i'm from Israel, and the combo package didn't get here, only the regular with the new songs). <br /> <br />So that's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you buy it, i hope you enjoy it...

B000E97HIA|5.0|Upon buying 3121, I heard a lot of reviews praising Prince and yet some said that his age shows on this LP. They claimed his music is getting preachy and boring. I am now 10 songs deep into the album and I am enjoying every single track on the LP. He continues to make incredible music. The intro got me tapping my feet and then it went into Lolita which is a hot track and I can bet that it will be his next single. But so far this album is everything that I had expected. Many was comparing it to his 1987 masterpiece Sign O' The Times. I wouldn't go that far though. Thats like comparing a pastor to God. Its no comparison at all but I can say that its a great follow up to 2004's Musicology which, like many Prince albums, I did enjoy. It actually seems more upbeat than Musicology. This LP takes Prince back a few years because he sounds younger and more uplifted as every song plays. Well Ladies and Gentlemen, Prince is here to stay. 3121 further proves that Prince is a legend and his music can compete with the many shallow pop acts surfacing. Whatever you do, get this album!

B0000009SF|5.0|Although TGW is arguably one of FZ's greatest and most cohesive albums, it may not be the best choice for the novice. It's somewhat inaccessible and requires repeated listening in order to appreciate the sheer scope of the bizarre soundscapes. So check out \\"Joe's Garage\\" or \\"Overnite Sensation\\" first if you're new to FZ. However, once you have acquired a taste for FZ, get this one. I own nearly 3/4 of his studio albums and this one is definitely in the top five. \\"Blessed relief\\" alone is worth the price of admission.  <br /> <br />The world needs Frank Zappa and his spirit lives on, even if ugly radio ignores him...
B000002BBY|5.0|This has been one of my all time favourite bands since I was a little eight year old girl in pigtails in the fourth grade. In the twelve/thirteen years I've been listening to their music, not once have I been fortunate enough to see them in concert but I hear they put on quite a show. This cd epitomizes what Oasis is about and gives you a taste of their very best musical talents, even though they have a lot of great tracks in their other albums. <br /> <br />If you like rock and roll, pick up this album and see if you too do not fall under the spell of the Gallagher brothers.
0307276902|1.0|At a time of considerable controversy in the book world - authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail versus the author(s) of Da Vinci code - I almost find this to be a larger example of literary plagiarism. The entire tone and subject-matter are so similar to Ken Kesey's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as to be virtually indistinguishable.
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|This is one of those films which could never be destined for fame.  Its a nice story - but its a story that has been told many times in different ways.  But for all that, it has a couple of new twists (or maybe they are old twists presented in a new way.) It is nowhere as good as Masayuki Suo's enchanting \\"Shall We Dance?\\".  I found that I empathized with several of the characters although there are some very complex characters.  The final dance scene was certainly the highlight of the film for me.  It sparkled and it was kind of fun.  Totally predictable but with a slight twist at the end which provided an outcome with more depth. It proved a nice resolution to the \\"tension\\" that the plot builds up - or is that \\"exasperation\\"?  I know Richard G is a dancer, but somehow he never looks completely confortable in this role to me.  I enjoyed the film.  I guess I would put it in the \\"mindless entertainment\\" category.  The story is virtually the same as the old Australian Film \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" of course and a remake of the Masayuki Suo film of the same name.  For my part, I enjoyed Strictly Ballroom more - even if it did seem slightly less polished acting-wise.  It's good to have this in my collection. I've watched it twice but when friends call over to watch a movie, it's always overlooked.  While it's fun, it doesnt shine out as anything very special. It takes a lot of film to convey the message \\"follow your dream\\".  I find women love it.  Probably our Richard has a lot to do with that fact.
0307276902|5.0|My husband an I didn't have the heart to let our daughter cry it out like everyone suggested we do. Exhaustion was wearing us down, I started searching for other options. Thankfully we found other parents like us who didn't want to traumatize their children for the sake of a few z's. <br /> <br />The no cry sleep solution was a godsend. It showed us that our daughter's night waking was normal, but just because it was normal didn't mean we couldn't change it. Within days our daughter night wakings went from 6-12 time a night to 1-2 times. I can't explain what a difference it has made.  <br /> <br />The strategies are simple to follow and results are immediate. I am so proud of our decision and have recommended this book to anyone with a baby. I know you and your child will benefit. <br /> <br />
B00006JIA4|4.0|From their 70s beginnings, Queen's unique sound and their masterful compositions sounded like they would stand the test of time. As the years go by the Queen catalog seems more and more important to the history of popular music. Rarely does a Queen track sound dated. This is not just a testament to their musicianship and what was always a faultless production, but also to their diversity and willingness to experiment with new sounds.  <br />This should be the ultimate Queen collection: 3 discs of their greatest worldwide hits, and technically it hits the bullseye. The first two discs are loaded with Queen classics from the 70s and 80s. The third disc seems more like an oddity as it contains Freddie Mercury and Brian May solo tracks, remixes, live versions of hits performed with other artists, and songs from their catalog that went unreleased for years, until the issue of the \\"Made In Heaven\\" album in 1995. However, just about any Queen release ever in Europe was a legitimate chart hit, so the title of \\"Greatest Hits III\\" only seems misleading to us Americans.  <br />While most of disc 3 is interesting, some of it is not worthy (to my ears) of being included in this set. And the fact that so many better Queen songs (including some American chart hits) were overlooked for this compilation, it makes the third disc seem all the more inadequate. The addition of \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\", \\"Body Language\\", \\"Need Your Loving Tonight\\" and \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" would have increased this set's value all the more. <br />Still, the first two discs show nary a misstep in the Queen legacy from \\"Seven Seas Of Rhye\\" to \\"We Will Rock You\\" to \\"Radio Ga-Ga\\" to \\"The Invisible Man\\": just four examples of Queen's constant desire to grow and expand beyond what they had already accomplished.  <br />This amazing band's work will only be more revered in the years (or decades) to come. <br />
0553573403|5.0|GRRM's A song of Ice and Fire is hands down the greatest series I have ever read. I have always loved fantasy but for a while I had all but given up on the gnere, until I chanced upon this book, now I can find nothing that even begins to compare with it.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones has a feel to it from the very first page. Just reading the prologue I noticed that Martin's style was exceptionnal, it is full of metaphor wihtout being heavy handed and he is alternately twistedly funny and hanutingly grusesome. The symbolisme that runs all through the books is absolutely brilliantly handled and the reader is not patronized with the wirting.<br /><br />The plot avoids all the usual traps and clich&eacute;s of fantasy. We are in a medieval world that seems almost real and which is untainted by an over proliferation of magic. All the way through you are face to face with a gritty tale that tastes more like an unforgiving medieval Europe more than a fantasy world. The plot twists and turns surprisingly and shakes up the fnasty genre by dooming many of it's characters, heroes and anti-heroes, to die before the end. It is not a predictable tale that spares you from reality and horrors, it is filled with death, betrayal, violence, incest. Here at last is a plot that focuses on the political wars of the high nobility instead of on the struggles of some worthy peasant boy. The lords and ladies are both the \\"hereos\\" and the \\"villains\\". Do not however expect for the division of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" to be that well defined. Just when you think you fully loathe a character the author surprises you and turns it around. The characters are three dimensional and wonderfully intense. The \\"heroes\\" are not always brave and good and perfect and brilliant, and the \\"villains\\" are truly evil, they do not just rule a kingdom wickedly as they would in most fantasy series, they are horrbly twistedly cruel sometimes in a way \\"softer\\" fantasy has never made them.<br /><br />As for the actual plot of the this book, \\"A game of Thrones\\" is set in the seven kingdoms for the most part known as Westeros, fourteen years after the war known as \\"Robert's Rebellion\\" when the new king slew prince Rheagar Targaryen on the Trident for the love of a woman. Now, the wolves, the Starks of Winterfell sit in the North, King Robert sits the Iron throne surrounded by the Lions of Lannister. There political intrigue begins to stir as mena nad women make their own plans for power and the Starks are called to court. But far in the north of the seven kingdoms, beyond the icy Wall, something darker than simple political intrigue is stirring. Across the narrow sea, in the territories of the free cities, hides Daenerys Stormborn of the Targaryen line born even as her family saw it's demise, dreaming of dragons.<br /><br />This series is wonderful that is all I can say about it, it is Fantasy at it's best, most brilliant state.the this book, \\"A game of Thrones\\" is set in the seven kingdoms for the most part known as Westeros, fourteen years after the war known as \\"Robert's Rebellion\\" when the new king slew prince Rheagar Targaryen on the Trident for the love of a woman.

B000BBOUU4|4.0|This remake of charlie & the Chocolate Factory is at first frustrating but that is because you consantly compare it to the original.   Depp's portrayal  is in many ways different than Gene Wilder's but still very entertaining.  I especially liked the revealing look into who Willy Wonka is as a person; a welcome addition to the storyline.
0375701427|2.0|This certainly is a prime example of brilliant manipulative rhetoric by the author, well executed for maximum readerly affect. In some respects thouroughly reprehensible, though. (I do not expect to get a positive response from this review, but that's okay).
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|If you're looking for some rabid machine gun double bass drums, crazy shredding guitar riffs, awesome hair raising solos, and bone chilling vocals, well you've come to the right and I do mean RIGHT place here. Behemoth's brand new full length album entitled \\"Demigod\\" is just beyond amazing, and no words can describe how awesome this album truly is. This was my first Behemoth album I ever bought, and whenever I listen to this, it gives me an adrenaline rush every time, because I just can't get enough of it. Nergal's vocals on here are just awesome and bone chilling beyond words. There's also lots of crazy shredding riffs and awesome solos from him and Seth. Orion's bass lines are very heavy and freaky, and Inferno's wild machine gun double bass drumming is like a race car going at 100 miles per hour. Here is an analysis of my favorite songs.<br /><br />1. Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth - Begins with a soft acoustic interlude, and then the double bass and heavy guitars roar in, and before you know it, all hell breaks loose. Great album opener. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />2. Demigod - Awesome title cut, more great double bass drumming. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />3. Conquer All - Great song with some more bone crushing riffs and a very nice solo. Nergal's vocals are very creepy on here. Rating 5/5<br /><br />8. XUL - Another one of my favorites. Also features an awesome guest solo from Karl Sanders of Nile (another one of my favorite death metal bands). Rating: 5/5<br /><br />9. Slaves Shall Serve - My favorite song on here and one of the fastest on here. Inferno's drumming is just absolutely wild throughout and also some of the best on here as well. I even get chills down my back when I hear Nergal roars out the line \\"Slaves Shall Serve\\". Rating: 10/5<br /><br />10. The Reign Ov Shemsu-Hor - The epic 8 minute + closer. Awesome song, I really like this one. It's also the slowest song on here, but it still crushes you like a bug. Great solos BTW. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />The entire song list and ratings:<br /><br />1.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is my first Madonna album ive ever listened to and let me tell you it is AWESOME!! I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM- i had only heard \\"hung up\\" once- but i only heard half of it and i wasnt really all that into it! I was at the store going CRAZY on if  i should buy Fall Out Boy's \\"take this to your grave\\" or Il Divo's deubt album. i really couldnt decide. for some weeks i had been eyeing that AMAZING album cover Madonna had! the pose was Awsome-and her Red Hair went Perfectly with the black background her outfit and those REALLY Colorful MADONNA letters! AND I BOUGHT IT! i dont know what drove me to buy it! i just bought it! i dont know why! i guess i just wanted to hear something diffrent! at FIRST i HATED THIS ALBUM! i was thinking of ways to get rid of it-because i didnt like it! at that time ALL of the songs sounded the same to me, and it wasnt becasuse of the fact that every song ends and starts the same.- the only song that i could tell apart from the rest was Hung Up. It took me bout 6 listens to really LOVE this album! and i am SO GLAD I GAVE IT A CHANCE!!!  <br /> <br />MY Favorite songs are  <br />Push  <br />Sorry  <br />Let it Will be  <br />Get Togethet  <br />Hung Up  <br /> <br /> <br />1.Hung Up- A great upbeat song that is built around a sample of ABBA's \\"gimmie gimmie gimmie(a man after midnight) a great club song that will have you dancing all night long. If you like this song you'll love the A*Teens version of Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie(a man after midnight) DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!! 10/10  <br /> <br />2.Get Together- I LOVE how this begins with that type of bell and then it quicly goes to this quiet but kind of Mysterious sounding synthizizer!This is a really GREAT SONG! 10/10  <br /> <br />3.Sorry-I love how this song begins with the \\"i heard it all before\\" and MY FAVORITIST line is \\"i dont wanna hear, i dont wanna know\\" this song should definalty go to #1 and when it hits AT40 im gonna support it all the way!. In this song Madonna says im sorryin many diffrent languages. this song talks about how her man is nothing and that hes just wasting his time and hers saying \\"sorry\\". 10/10  <br /> <br />4.Future Lovers-This song is kinda weird Madonna sounds like shes a computerized spa that instead of messeging you she hypnotyzes you into forgetting your problems.This song sounds very Futaristic. Although i REALLY dont like this song i have to give her props for sounding like a computer spa- that was just genius. 2/10  <br /> <br />5.I love New York- Although the lyrics are  very kinda dumb- they do help express how much she loves New York. i dont really like the beat and this song. 4/10  <br /> <br />6.Let it will Be- I love this song. My favorite line is \\"just watch me burn\\" i love the beat and everything- a GREAT SONG. 10/10  <br /> <br />7.Forbidden Love- It kinda sounds like shes saying For bein in Love instead of Forbidden Love. This is just another flaw in this album. Although it is better than \\"future lovers\\" and  \\"i love new York\\" this is still another kinda sucky song. 4/10  <br /> <br />8.Jump- i do NOT KNOW why she might be relesing this as another single- the chorus is so LAME it sound like if it was written by some 2nd grader.\\"are you ready to jump/im ready to jump/get ready to jump oh baby/yes im ready to jump just take my hand\\" that is one of the lamest chorus i have EVER heard besides Ashanti's \\"Baby\\" I like how she sing the chorus but the lyrics just messed it up- the rest of this song is AMAZING- she shouldve definatley written a diffrent chorus for this song. 7/10  <br /> <br />9.How High- In this song Madonna questions how the entratainment buisness will be without her, and just how high she's gotten. I LOVE the chorus because she did a really good job asing the questions and singing at the same time. 10/10  <br /> <br />10.Isaac- although for some this might be a very weird and boring type of song but i love it! i love how she mixes her huuuuhuuuuhuuu with that middle-eastern sounding guy'simah-ninaloh-imah-ninanaeloh in the chorus. that guy's voice was a GREAT input in this really good song! 9/10  <br /> <br />11.Push- MY DEFINATE FAVORITE SONG ON THIS ALBUM- This is Lyrically one of the best songs i had heard in a while. i LOVE THE BEAT AND THE Chorus! Madonna sings about how someone has pushed her through a lot and how she appriciates it! 10/10  <br /> <br />12.Like it or Not-  In this song Madonna explains that she is who she is and that dont dont try to change her because its not gonna happen, And that like it or not shes still gonna be that same person no matter what you do to try and stop her and no matter who you are.\\"This is who I am/  <br />You can like it or not/  <br />You can love me or leave me/ <br />Cause I'm never gonna stop\\". Although Like it or Not and Isaac may not be no so much of Dance songs like the rest ,they still prove to be VERY worthy in deserving to be in  this TOUR DE FORCE Dance Album. 10/10  <br /> <br /> <br />Although Confessions on a Dance Floor May not be the best Lyrically written album of 2005-It still provides REALLY GREAT LISTENS!!!  <br /> <br />The Inside Album has really GREAT AND AMAZING Madonna pictures!!!  <br /> <br />Final Grade 8/10
B00008QSA5|5.0|I had forgotten over the years just how wonderful this album was, so I was thrilled to find it here at Amazon! Granted, it's not the heavy black vinyl with the faded dog earred cover, but this one fits in my car stereo, makes the commute miles fly by and sounds even better then it did long ago! Thanks!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Hey,  <br /> <br />Priest music is a unique class of its own and, has a \\"classical music\\" structure. Only the instruments used are harder. Remember, Rob was formerly an opera singer! So, his influence on Priest music is highly intellectual and most songs of Priest are actually \\"heavy-metal operas\\" (incl. songs of AOR). This explains why very rich musical intelligence exist in most of the Priest songs.  <br /> <br />It is not possible to compare for example, Priest music with Queen. Queen is a popular group, created simple, significant and easily understandable music. Priest, on the other hand, is not. In Priest, one should understand that, the songs are not popular and easily consumed ones. Very hard to understand, but, remains forever great when completely understood !   <br /> <br />For example, one of my best friends was educated on classical music. He has a great archive on classics. However, at age 19, he surprisingly discovered and switched to Judas Priest. The symphonic structure of Priest provided this. He is one of the greatest Priest lovers in all over the world at the moment (36 years old now !).  <br /> <br />So guys, Judas Priest is a classical diamond presented to us as an eternal gift. Only, the interface that they communicate with us is new and technologic.  <br /> <br />Never give up to understand... <br /> <br />Cheers, Ron. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />     <br />
B00000ILGB|5.0|For their first three records - this was the second - Amon Duul II were a tight, imaginative unit that could hold their own with the great American and English bands of the period.  Imagine Jimi Hendrix fronting a more gothic version of Jefferson Airplane with a dash of the Who, but with a unique and trippy lyrical slant.   The first LP here (this was a 2-LP set) has lots of great riffs and tracks, and the second is eerie improvisation.  All in all, a fine record.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Who knew that a certain television network had hands of blue and would yank probably one of the most innovative and well-scripted shows before it had a chance to take off (yeah, a bad pun, I know!)  Firefly the series is the precursor to the feature film Serenity, and what a precursor it was!   <br /> <br />The series, presented on DVD in the proper order of episodes, opens with Serenity, Part One and Two, which provides much of the background for the series and eventually the movie.  The Train Job is third which was actually the series opener picks up the action and carries it forward.  A few of the episodes on Disk 2 were somewhat slower, but it was a series after all, not a feature film.  Object in Space, the final episode, is so incredibly good, I hope that if Joss Whedon ever does get back to a series or another movie for \\"Serenifly\\", that Jubal Early makes an appearance. <br /> <br />If you are in need of entertainment, and have yet to see the complete series, buy this.  You won't be disappointed.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Yes, it's totally original.  The person who made this movie created a whole plot that maybe only he/she would understand.....I had to go on the internet and look up explanations to figure the movie out.  Basically, the hero of the movie is thrusted into an alternate universe where certain rules apply.  Thankfully the director's cut inserts the laws/rules of the alternate universe as text for you to read, which may clear things up a bit.  There's a lot to see in this movie, and a second viewing is helpful or by going to internet descussion sites.  The main characters bunny friend gave me nightmares, very scary.
B0002S947K|1.0|I never heard of R. Lamontagne <br />before I was buying a Gatemouth <br />cd and Amazon pushed his cd with <br />5 star reviews, so I said maybe  <br />another wonderful musician I missed. <br />No, he's not. All the songs are  <br />slow, boring, whiney, nasally  <br />sung tributes to Satan and Evil, <br />masquerading as blues.  <br />Satan is on the jacket, in the <br />blurb inside, and in songs  <br />as the hero. At least Robert  <br />Johnson got some talent for his soul, <br />Ray got Nuttin. Avoid this  <br />10 song lemon. <br />

0684833395|2.0|I am using my mom's account and so this review is by me, not my mom. <br /> <br />I read this book for a book project. I must say that I was misled by the short description of the book that said that it was \\"full of witty humor\\". This book makes very little sense. The order of events is screwed up to the point that I was strongly tempted to rip out the pages and put them in some kind of a rational order. The \\"humor\\" in the book is really not that funny to be honest. The rare moments of true comedy were so scarce as to not be able to justify this books existence. Any morals or \\"big ideas\\" that you were supposed to get out of reading this book are lost in the nonsensical ramblings that I guess were supposed to be the plot. I gave this book a star rating because I was required to. Actually, I have mixed feelings about its contents and can't decide on a good rating. I guess the absurdity of the book could be a comparison to the absurdity of war. <br />
B000002H70|4.0|While The Cure's extensive catalog of releases has on many occasions, depending on what era of the band you are listening to, been hit-or-miss, it was during this late 1980's period that The Cure were hitting their creative stride, climaxing with Wish, Disintegration's follow-up just a few years later, and in my opinion the peak of creativity for the once-upon-a-time kings of synth pop. While Disintegration doesn't quite live up to Wish's superior musically technical performances and production, it doubtlessly lays the roots for Robert Smith's ever advancing songwriting, more than a mere necessity to the music than technical proficiency as atmosphere has always been at the core of a Cure peformance before being able to play fast. <br /> <br />While the whole album is listenable, over time my constant replays have slowly begun to tend towards the second half of the album, beginning with Lullaby, as the songs begin to take on a consistently more haunting feel with the progression of the record as a whole, mainly due to the ever-increasing gloom with each track, giving the listener the feeling that they are constantly slipping further into Smith's love-battered mind, away from the cheery, almost too cliche 80's keyboard sounds of Plainsong until the bleak and dreary picture of lost love on The Same Deep Water As You. As with almost all music released in the 80's, Disintegration's atmospheric tracks are built around the synths of Roger O'Donnell, which while they are entrancing during the latter half of the album, are often grating on the ears during Plainsong and Closedown, maybe just being to cheesey for my picky keyboard tastes. <br /> <br />The production tends to get a bit too glossy on some tracks, the overpowering amount of overdubbed guitars being a little much to take in at points while contributing to the dense atmospheres of other songs such as the title track, one of the albums highpoints along with Homesick, which sounds like an early 80's take of Wish's Trust, and the creepy drug detox anthem of Lullaby, which skips along behind a plucked violin with a unique descending synth track. <br /> <br />As far as technical performances go, some members shine while others lack the dark, emotional drive required of such moody tunes, Robert Smith's incredible vocal performance, Roger O'Donnell's mood-shifting keys and Simon Gallup's fluid basslines which carry many of the songs from start to finish taking the top notches in the performance department, whereas founding Cure member Laurence Tolhurst's presence is essentially at zero and drummer Boris Williams delivers a performance which could easily (and more cost-effectively) have been played on a drum machine, only choosing a select few tracks to deliver any live drum sounds. <br /> <br />Complaints aside, Disintegration is one of the best mood-pieces of the 80's, and Homesick, Untitled, and Pictures Of You are simply blissful. Regardless of the less-than-technical playing, this album cannot be missed, by either the Cure fanatic or casual fan, and the live DVD Trilogy showcases a performance of these songs with more advanced musicianship, so be sure to pick that up as well, but before all else, get Wish, The Cure's finest hour.
B0007TFI92|2.0|Early 70's Pink Floyd is evoked and outright copied here on the first two tracks.  \\"Circulation of Events\\" is a worthwhile piece of dissonent electronic music, foreboding and pulsing.  \\"Wahn\\" is strange manipulation of vocals straight out of Pink Floyd's \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals ...\\" off \\"Ummagumma\\".  Highly derivative. <br />
B000055ZB8|5.0|Excellent 1922 silent horror film, classic storyline, great character plot, and the sepia color added a nice touch to it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes horror or has an interest/appreciation for good film. Though it is old, it is very well done for it's time. Nosferatu beats any new age 'dracula' story, it doesn't focus on fashion nor trend. It simply is what it is.
B00006GFAB|5.0|If you're a KISS fan then obviously you have all these songs but if you're just getting into the hottest band in the world start here. I would'nt say this is THE best of KISS but only some of the best. KISS has tons of great tunes in their catalog like 'Parasite','Within','Psycho Circus','Tears Are Falling','Loves A Deadly Weapon','Hooligan','Hate' just to name a few. Check 'em out.
B000E97HIA|4.0|I deeply dig every song on this album. Trust me, it's been a REALLY LOOOONG TIME since I've said that about a Prince CD! If it's not quite as brilliant as \\"1999\\", \\"Purple Rain\\" or \\"Sign o' the Times\\" IT IS AS BRIILIANT AS (if not better than) \\"Parade\\", \\"LoveSexy\\" & \\"The Gold Experience\\". Also, it's a hundred times more fun than \\"Musicology\\". There is a spirit of joy on this album that hasn't been heard on a Prince CD since the late 80's. I also welcome the message of \\"Get on the Boat\\". It's nice to hear Prince urging unity again. Reminds me of the \\"I wish there was no Black & White / I wish there were no rules\\" days.  <br /> <br />I'm all about calling out Prince when he makes sub-par or overly self-indulgent material but I really can't find any major faults with \\"3121\\". I could nit-pick and say that \\"Lolita\\" and \\"Fury\\" could've used more live ambiance or that \\"Beautiful, Loved & Blessed\\" is only included to help pimp the new CD by Tamar...but that would be pointless. This album is tight from start to finish & I've already given it more spins than \\"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\\", \\"NEWS\\", \\"Rainbow Children\\" & \\"Musicology\\" combined.  <br /> <br />The Kid is in \\"rare form\\" tonight. I say BRAVO!
0694003611|5.0|This was the first book I wanted for my now 4-month-old, and I'm so glad.  It's a definite part of our bedtime ritual (now that we have one), and I've enjoyed reading it to her since she was about 2 weeks old.  Different pages grab her interest at different stages; initially she loved to stare at the cow jumping over the moon, and now it's the last page with the dimly lit room.<br /><br />This book has the best of all combinations:  simple black and white images; bright color combinations; simple phrases; repetition.  And as an adult, I've loved noticing the small details, such as the way the moon travels through the window space and the little bunny changes position to say goodnight to all his treasures.<br /><br />GRAB YOUR TISSUES:  I recently posted some photos of my husband reading this to our baby on a message board.  One of the women there said that the photos brought up some strong emotions, because she could hear her beloved late mother's voice reading those words to her even now.  As I read this to Emily, I realize I may be creating lifelong memories of time with her mother and father.  \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the perfect book for this kind of magic.

B00000254Q|5.0|No album from Santana could top or even match the musical perfection of their 1969-1971 period, but Amigos comes close.  David Brown returns to play rock solid bass, and add the \\"Afro\\" back into Afro-cuban.  Ndugu Chancler does a terrific job of playing drums and timbales at the same time.  He's not as good as Michael Shrieve, but he did good nonetheless.  <br />The album is really good, and it gets even better after each listen.  Dance Sister Dance and Europa are the highlights of the album.  Look Up (To See What's Coming Down) is a great song that resembles almost perfectly to the old Santana.  Let Me is one of three \\"funk\\" flavored songs.  This is actually not that bad of a song.  It's actually pretty good if you listen to it a few times.  Only one song in the whole album is bad, \\"Tell Me Are you Tired.\\"  This album could definetly do without it.   <br />Overall, this album is the damn near closest you can get to the original Santana sound, only Abraxas Pool gets to the same level to the originals.  Nevertheless, buy this album.  You will not be dissappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love Joss Whedon, PLEASE make a second season to fit between the first and the movie!! I've NEVER bought a TV series before, but I bought this one, and I watch it all the time. GENIUS.
B0000027D5|5.0|First off, this album is mostly instrumental.  Only 4 out of 22 songs have any lyrics in them.  But that does NOT mean that the album isn't good.  On the contrary, this is one of the best live albums out there.  This was recorded at the peak of Santana's jazz period, and the songs show it.  Oye Como Va, Samba Pa Ti, Toussaint L'Overture, Waiting, and other songs from the 1969-1971 period are clearly way more jazz influenced, but they still rock.   <br />Special mention must be said toward the pecussion section.  Michael Shrieve perfected beyond compare the amazing style of drumming to seamlessly blend in with the rest of the percussion musicians.  He was the first to do it, and no one else has done it so perfectly since.  The keyboard team of Richard Kermode and Tom Coster further demonstrates the heavy jazz influences.  And as always, Carlos rips on guitar.   <br />The highlights of the album are the long instrumentals, mainly the Shrieve composition, \\"Every Step of the Way\\" and the masterpiece \\"Incident at Neshabur.\\" The whole album is worth buying just for these two songs. <br />To hear Santana at it's best, purchase this album.   <br /> <br />**If you want to hear the original Santana band perform live, purchase Santana III Legacy Edition.  It contains the band's amazing breathtaking performance at the Fillmore West, July 4 1971.  <br />
B000002LFU|3.0|I was in college when this album first came out, and I remember being disappointed overall at the effort -- GREEN was a real departure for REM at the time, insofar as that it largely left behind the jangle and obfuscation of earlier albums in favor of a big, clear and mainstream-friendly \\"rock\\" sound. I remember being turned off by what seemed (at the time) like too-obvious bids for airplay, like \\"Pop Song 89\\" and the awful \\"Stand.\\" I remember the stark contrast between the gentler, more thoughtful songs - \\"Hairshirt,\\" \\"The Wrong Child,\\" \\"You Are The Everything\\" and the goofy, charming \\"Bonus Track 1\\" - and the rest of the album. <br /> <br />And, soon enough, I put the album (or, more accurately, I put the cassette) aside and largely forgot about it. <br /> <br />Fast forward to 2006. I'm looking through some used CDs and find a cheap copy of \\"Green.\\" I figure I might as well pick it up and take a step toward completing my REM CD library. The next day, as I'm driving to work, I slip it into the car stereo.  <br /> <br />And, halfway in, I find myself weeping uncontrollably. <br /> <br />In 1990, when this album was released, I'd heard \\"The Wrong Child\\" as a truly poignant and sad piece of music -- powerful enough to strike a resonant chord with me, but not one that actually related directly to my life as a college kid. In 2006, hearing \\"The Wrong Child\\" again for the first time in years, I find myself reacting as a father of a child with special needs... and I almost wish I hadn't purchased the album. It hurts that much to hear Michael Stipe offering the perspective of a chronically-ill or special needs child, yearning in the most impossible and innocent way to do the simplest things that 'normal' kids do. While he watches other kids \\"jump in the tall grass, leap the sprinklers,\\" ride their bikes and play on swingsets... he is alone. Always, always alone. And isolated. And left to try to find his own kind of solace: \\"I will try to sing a happy song. I'll try to make a happy game to play.\\" <br /> <br />I'm sitting there in my car, listening to this, and tears are suddenly streaming down my face, and I'm doing a less-than-successful job of just trying to blink them away, and then Stipe gets to the chorus: <br />\\"I'm not supposed to be like this.\\" <br /> <br />And I just lose it. I completely lose it. I have to pull over to the side of the road, because I'm crying so hard. Because this isn't just a song anymore: this is something real and painful in a way I'd never hoped to experience -- these are the words of a kid who could be my kid, self-aware of his 'difference' from other kids and so, so very isolated because of it. And, despite that, a kid who still tries to \\"sing a happy song,\\" because that is what kids do. <br /> <br />I'm a different person now than I was when I first heard this album. And I still don't like \\"Stand\\" or \\"Pop Song 89.\\" But \\"The Wrong Child\\" resonated for me then, and now... I don't even know the words to describe how it makes me feel now. I'm not even sure it was a good thing to bring that song back into my life. But anything that can affect you on that deep and profound a level is the kind of art that should be recognized - and respected - as a real achievement.
B0002MG9SI|5.0|If you're not a workaholic, take time to watch sunsets and enjoy simple pleasures such as \\"skipping stones\\", then chances are Amelie will steal your heart.     I don't know, what can I say... Do the French just feel more passionately about life in general? Maybe so, maybe not. But I think this film could melt the frostiest stiff.     Everyone Amelie encounters has such an interesting personality and she brings such a ray of sunshine into their lives. From encouraging her father, by hilarious means, to travel the world, mischievously matchmaking cafe locals and of course her absolutely romantic stratagems she devises to pursue true love, this film breathes humanity. \\"Do you want to meet me?\\"... who wouldn't be curious about that!?    The part where she's day dreaming of Nino sneaking up behind her , running his hand across the beaded curtain, which simultaneously turns out to be her cat, is such a beautiful human touch that I rarely see done in films. Heart warming and genius.    The adorable Audrey Tautou is magical to watch as she brings Amelie to life with caring and compassion. She drinks life so deeply. And being that most of us live in such a fast paced, and self centered society we could learn a few things from Amelie.
B00004RF9G|4.0|Although painted backdrops and cyclorama stand in for the \\"heathered hills\\" of Scotland, M-G-M's film version of BRIGADOON (directed by Vincente Minnelli) does feature Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly in some of their finest work on screen.  Charisse in particular dazzles as Fiona with some fancy footwork in \\"The Heather on the Hill\\", the memorable pas de deux with Kelly.  Dody Heath and Van Johnson provide the cute secondary romance.  The Broadway score of Lerner and Loewe (\\"Waitin' for My Dearie\\", \\"I'll Go Home with Bonnie Jean\\", \\"Almost Like Being in Love\\", etc.) is justly-delivered by the renowned M-G-M Studio Orchestra under the baton of Johnny Green (with arrangements by Conrad Salinger).<br /><br />Originally this film was to have been shot on location in Scotland, but budget cuts under the new studio head Dore Schary prevented this.  The fake sets combined with the CinemaScope ratio spelled disaster for the film technically.  Artistically, BRIGADOON's heart was in the right place and the sincerity of the performers overcomes any of the bigger problems.  Still wonderful.
0399226907|5.0|This is probably my favorite children's book ever. As a graphic designer and illustrator, I love every drawing he creates. it's so simple (even the backgrounds are devoid of info). Every child seems to gravitate to his books, and that's a testament to him being able to get back to the child state that every artist should strive to achieve.
B000C65Z20|4.0|The Constant Gardener is a triumph for Director Fernando Meirelles. The movie, filmed in Kenya and South Sudan, was based on John Le Carre's novel (also set in Africa) of love, intrigue and suspense in the British diplomatic service.  <br /> <br />The story centres on Justin, a mid-level diplomat in the British Foreign Service, he bumbles around not wanting to upset people and just 'does his job'. He meets and marries the passionate and somewhat unruly Tessa, a political activist. Tessa, unknown to Justin, is involved in exposing unethical drug trailing on sample populations of poor Africans by pharmaceutical companies. Tessa's activities begin to embarrass some members of the diplomatic staff, and she is found brutally murdered. Justin, who was oblivious until her death of her attempt to expose the pharmaceutical intrigue, decides to uncover the truth about her murder. As Justin unravels the truth of Tessa's involvement in the exposure of the drug trails, he enters her world and 'transitions' into her relationships. <br /> <br />Ralph Fiennes is well cast as Justin Quayle, the gardener of the title. Tessa is played by Rachel Weisz, who got an academy award (2006) for her performance, and she was absolutely amazing as Tessa. But for my money the pottering, passive Justin was just wonderfully portrayed by Fiennes. He typifies the British 'mustn't grumble' character of so many serving in the diplomatic corps. Also worth noting is the strong performance by Pete Postlewaite as a jaded South African doctor working with refugees, he gives the movie a wry 'reality bite'. <br /> <br />The story is told in 'flash-back' sequences with Justin remembering scenes from the life he shared with Tessa, and the plot moves back and forth from past to present, Africa to Europe, and gradually builds up to a very powerful ending. The music is wonderfully atmospheric and really adds to the slightly melancholy, pessimistic nature of the film. <br /> <br />The intrigue of the plot which involved the British High Commission, pharmaceutical trails, and 'jobs in the UK', really made me ponder the 'ethical investment' policy of the British government in the late 1990s. The movie raises some politically sensitive issues about the collusion of self-seeking individuals in government and pharmaceutical investment. Thank goodness Holywood is at last getting over its, um, 'liberal tendencies'...
0694003611|5.0|What can you say? I think every parent has this book in their library and it's just so fun to read, as well as having your kids point out everything on every page. It's just one of those books that you don't think about having in your home. It's just there period. And if not, you can be sure grandma will get it.
B0000067L4|5.0|Back in the day, one of the easiest ways to start an argument was to pose the question, \\"Who is the best guitarist of them all, Hendrix or Clapton?\\"  In confidence, even Clapton would probably admit that Hendrix was technically untouchable, and completely revolutionary in his approach.  But Clapton, also a virtuoso, was nipping at his heels.<br /><br />It would be hard to find two performers whose careers turned out more differently.  The legacy of Hendrix is based on a meteoric, incredibly brief career, and just three albums.  (All subsequent albums were released posthumously).  Clapton, in stark contrast, is one of the few survivors of that era still performing, and looking relatively healthy at that.  But this is where it gets tricky.  A quick scan of Clapton's post-Cream work reveals nothing wonderful, and much that is just all right.  A good percentage would sound right at home in a doctor's office waiting room.<br /><br />To get an idea of what a young, incendiary Clapton was all about, get hold of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton and play Steppin' Out.  That's two-and-a-half minutes of speed, bite, and raw blues power you won't soon forget, absolutely mind-boggling.  The formation of Cream, which happened soon after leaving Mayall, found Clapton teaming up with two other highly talented players, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker. Baker, on drums, was perhaps a bit more show than dough, but Bruce was a prodigy, and actually the real secret behind Cream's success.  Clapton would say later, \\"I was under Jack's spell for a while.\\"  In addition to his amazing voice, Bruce reinvented the role of the bass guitar, in effect, making Cream a three-person band with two guitars.  Innumerable bands have tried to copy this formula, without success.<br /><br />In one sense, it doesn't matter which Cream CD you buy, they're all great, especially Wheels of Fire which features a live version of Crossroads so dazzling it belongs in the Smithsonian.  In time I may re-collect them all, but I began with Goodbye, primarily for the three live tracks: I'm So Glad, Politician, and Sittin' On Top Of The World.  I'm So Glad is pistol-hot; Bruce is working the bass almost as hard as Clapton is working the guitar.  Politician grinds and bends with an almost unbearable seductiveness, Clapton unloads and simply walks the dog on that one, riveting.  Closing out is a cover of the standard, Sitting On Top Of The World, and it is as close to a perfect example of ramped-up electrified Delta blues as you might ever hope to hear.<br /><br />The studio tracks are fine, but beware, they were written in the days when I Am The Walrus was chic, don't expect meaning or even logic.  Cream had the wit to quit while they were at the top of their game, this CD proves it.  What's ironic is that tracking the post-Cream career of Jack Bruce is much more rewarding than tracking Clapton's.  As far as Baker is concerned, all NYT obituaries notwithstanding, he's still not dead.  Highly recommended.began with Goodbye, primarily for the three live tracks: I'm So Glad, Politician, and Sittin' On Top Of The World.

B000002IZM|5.0|new age is perhaps one of the worst musical tendencies ever existed.  and unfortunately in his time vangelis did contribute to  this tendency. there are many reasons for cultivating an healthy distaste for new age, one being its schmultziness and the other being those who liked it. so, i am the last person to promote a new age composer (if that is not an oxymoron) such as vangelis.<br /><br />the soundtrack to blade runner, however, is an entirely different matter.  it is, in my opinion, one of the best soundtracks ever.  without doubt, it is possible to separate the sountrack from the film and judge the former on its own merits.  but, I don't think we should do that for soundtracks, for they are meant to be unseparable from the movies that they are attached to or produced for.<br /><br />for this reason, the inclusion of dialogue pieces from the movie to the soundtrack does not distract from, but actually contribute to, the soundtrack.  in fact, i would go so far as to claim that they are an integral part of vangelis' soundtrack.<br /><br />here is a soundtrack that produces an effect that is equally postmodern (I am also tempted to say \\"modern\\") and melancholic as the movie blade runner.<br /><br />if you liked the movie, it's a must. if you didn't like it, probably you might not like this one too-though you should definitely give it a chance for it might help you see the movie in a different light. and if you haven't seen the movie,  it might be tough to appreciate it thoroughly.  but, is there anyone out there who still haven't seen blade runner?
B000B8QG4A|5.0|OK, maybe that's an arguable point, but there's no denying that \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" is what Classic Disney is all about.  Every element of this glorious film, from the layouts to the vocals, is spot on perfection.  And what makes this achievement all the more remarkable is that it's an original story, a true testament to Walt Disney's genius for creativity and his understanding of what works for an audience.  'Cause boy, does it ever!  There are so many wonderful scenes, it's hard to pick a favorite.  I'd have to go with the \\"spaghetti kiss,\\" which has to be one of the most romantic, touching moments in all of film.  And major kudos to Peggy Lee and Sonny Burke, whose contributions to the soundtrack are immeasurable.  Watching Peg the chanteuse as Peg the Pooch is pure, unadulterated pleasure.  I've had some issues with the special features on some of Disney's other editions, finding them not so special, too much geared to the rugrats.  But the extras on this 50th Anniversary Edition are everything that an animation geek like myself could hope for: A fantastic making-of documentary, as well as some lovingly reconstructed segments from the Wonderful World of Disney.  Not to mention the usual still galleries, which I always find enjoyable.  If you have a love of Disney animation, or you're looking for a fun, wholesome experience that everyone in the family can enjoy, this DVD is an absolute must-have.
B00062J00S|5.0|This is an amazing story wonderfully told. It looks at life from a higher perspective than one would day in and day out. I was greatly inspired by this story - it's one of those movies that you want to have in your collection so you can be encouraged time and again. <br /> <br />The first half hour goes a little slow by today's standard.
B000E1ZBIQ|5.0|I'm a huge Domingo fan, and own both his \\"Chenier\\" DVDs: the Covent Garden production with Tomowa-Sintov and the Vienna Opera production with Benackova.  Neither is ideal, with Domingo not at his best in one and the soprano a bust in the other.  I was beginning to think that a truly great \\"Chenier\\" might not exist -- until now.  This LaScala performance is nothing short of electryifying.  Most of the credit has to go to Carreras, who gives one of the finest performances I have ever seen, either in or out of an opera house.  Carreras' work has never really been on my radar (I know him mostly from The Three Tenors and his later career), so this interpretation was a surprise -- and a revelation.  Not only is the sound incredible, but his passion and commitment to every moment are simply extraordinary.  For his performance alone you should snatch up this DVD.  Luckily, there are other major compensations.  Marton, although a bit more Amazon than delicate young French girl, sings with equal passion and beauty, and her acting is superb.  (When was the last time you saw an opera singer shed actual tears?)  Cappuccilli, who gives a stunning performance on the Vienna DVD, is not quite as wonderful here.  This was a few years later, and the sound was a little drier, a little more patchy.  But he warms up considerably in Act 3, giving a solid, old-fashioned, powerhouse performance.  The crowd goes wild, with good reason.  (I do abhor his tendency, however, prevalent in the Vienna DVD as well, to milk the applause, smile at the audience and wink at the conductor.  Talk about old school!)  The production itself is lavish and very attractive, and it's all masterfully conducted by Riccardo Chailly.  Bottom line: If you can only afford one \\"Chenier\\" on DVD, this is the one to get, no ifs, ands or buts.  Sorry, Placido.
0385513755|5.0|Well written. The chapters short but desciptive and packed with unusual situations. The special edition is a collectors item for the illustrations alone. I am not sure whether a movie can top it.A film cannot stop to admire the art works.<br /><br />I certainly consider it to be a novel not a historical fact.<br /><br />The best novel I ever read.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Let me start off by saying I am somewaht of a music snob.  If an album or artist is hanging out in the top 40, has found it's way to to mainstream radio, or been seen on MTV outside of \\"120 Minutes\\" ,(still miss that show), chances are I'm not listening.  However, I am ALWAYS looking for a new sound.  A unique but not too wacky group that will either awaken old genres or find new ones.  And in 2001, I found this with \\"Is This It\\".  Despite the popularity of the group at the time, and America's new fascination with garage rock, I still could not stop listening to the cd.  When I finally bought it, I listened even more.  I was less impressed with the second try, \\"Room On Fire\\", but still liked it, and was somewhat happy it's lack of widespread popularity turned many of it's freshman fans away.  But this one... this really IS it!  By far my favorite of the three, every song shows howfar along the band has coma along, and how they have come together as a group.  The songs are tighter, the sound is louder without being redundant, and it flows from start to finish as though there are really no individual songs, just ONE album, which I loved about \\"Is This It\\".  If you really liked the  first cd but not the second, I can understand you'd be less than thrilled to buy \\"First Impressions of Earth\\".  Take a deep breath , get the album, and you'll find yourself rocking out to what I believe the is most talented band out there today.
B000E97HIA|5.0|This is definitely the best album of the year! What a wonderful cd. Prince is the most talented artist of the modern age, he can do whatever he wants with music. <br />He shows the path, the others follow behind. I didn't like at all Musicology, instead this album is stunning! 100% Prince, classical and innovative, traditional and creative at the same time. A must-have it.
B000069HK2|5.0|1. Maybe Memories: 2/5-my least favorite song on the cd.  It does not seem to go at all with the rest of the cd, and more ironically it's the first track.  Ususally a skip for me.  <br />2. The Taste Of Ink: 5/5-A great choice for a first single.  Awesome beat, and memorable lyrics make this a song that you will keep on singing in your head.   <br />3. Bulimic: 5/5-Without a doubt, one of my favorite songs on the album.  Catchy chorus, original guitar part, overall great song.   <br />4. Say Days Ago: 4/5-I'm not in to the whole screaming thing from them, and that's what this song starts out like, but it gets better, but it's still not the best one on the album. <br />5. Poetic Tragedy: 5/5-Sounds a little different from everything else, but in this case it's a good thing.  The song is like a poem in itself, awesome song. <br />6. Buried Myself Alive: 4/5-Again, good choice for a single, great lyrics, but it may get a little boring if you keep listening to it over and over again.   <br />7. A Box Full Of Sharp Objects: 5/5-Fast paced, it grabs you and doesnt let go, and it sounds amazing. <br />8. Blue And Yellow: 5/5-Here's where the cd goes from fast to slow.  This is the slowest song on the cd, and one of the best by far.  Beautiful lyrics, and song, and it shows off Burt's vocal ability like no other song on the cd.  <br />9. Greener With The Scenery: 5/5-I don't know what it is about this song that I like so much, but I just love every minute of it.   <br />10. Noise And Kisses: 5/5-I gave this song a 5 because at the time of buying the cd, I could really relate it to my life, and what was going on at that point, great song. <br />11. On My Own: 4/5-Another slower song, not as good as \\"Blue and Yellow\\", but still a pretty good song, but it may get a bit boring. <br />12. Pieces Mended: 5/5-Good wrap up to a great cd.  <br />
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|Wow, after reading some of the great reviews for this, I feel like I was watching a different movie.  I found little of value about this movie.  Yes it is colorful.  The little red monster is cute.  That's about all I can say that's positive about this.  I personally found all the main characters to be completely unlikable, especially the dad.  This movie simply has no soul.  I guess really young kids who aren't choosy would sit through it, but that's about it.  I suggest renting it first before you buy this one.
B00000JQFM|5.0|This album without a doubt is Joe Satriani's greatest album followed closely by Flying In A Blue Dream and Strange Beautiful Music. This album has everything from the amazing guitar acrobatics of \\"Crushing Day\\" and \\"Ice Nine\\" to the sweet, beautiful vocal-like melodies of \\"Always With You, Always With Me\\" and everything in between. The one thing that is not perfect is the production. At the time Satch recorded this album, he did not have a lot of money to do a state of the art recording. The quality is not bad at all, but not up to par with his later albums. It attempts to be an 80's slick production, but isn't quite up there with the recording quality of it's slick 80's contemporaries. Still, as much as I care about sound and production, that is not enough to take a star off of this album. Satch and John Cuniberti did the best they could with their limited production and it doesn't sound half bad. Some may be turned off by the very 80's sounding drums and reverb and overall feel, but I love it. Well anyways here is the track analysis: <br /> <br />1. Surfing With The Alien 4/5- A rousing energetic rock number that gets you heart rate going with his mind bending solos. Not my absolute favorite on this album, but it is very good. <br /> <br />2. Ice Nine 4.5/5- ONe of the funkier numbers on this album soaked with hard rock. This song also showcases a lot of shred and energy. <br /> <br />3. Crushing Day 5/5- One of my favorites on this album with a lot of shredding. THis isn't the fastest that he goes, but he plays a fast solo for a long period of time for a section of the song. Also, one of my favorite rhythm riffs on the album. <br /> <br />4. Always With You, ALways With Me 5/5- Satch takes things down with one of my very favorite Satch songs ever. It is a very beautiful, emotional song with no shredding, but lots of feeling. Like all the rest of the songs on this album, this has no words, but lets the guitar speak or sing for itself, and it does! <br /> <br />5.Satch Boogie 4/5- A fun bluesy boogie type rocker sprinkled with progressive rock with lots of energetic playing and great tapping. A sure concert favorite.  <br /> <br />6. Hill Of The Skull 3/5- A very slow, haunting, dramatic short song. It is very good except that he ends it after less than 2 minutes. I would've given it more than 2 stars if it would've been longer.  <br /> <br />7. Circles 4/5- Here, Satch goes into a mid tempo song that turns fast towards the middle. He does some serious speed playing in this song. Another great track.  <br /> <br />8. Lords of Karma 5/5- A Middle Eastern flavored track with a sitar and all. It isn't the most hard rocking song and doesn't have the flashiest solo on this album, but it is so cool. For some reason it is one of the more underrated and forgotten tracks on here, by I think it is one of the best tracks on here with such a neat melody and great chord progression. THis track really stands out to me.  <br /> <br />9. Midnight 4/5- This song is a short little tapping piece with a totally clean guitar being played like a piano in the way that it is tapped. It has a very European classical feel and I love it every time I listen to it.  <br /> <br />10. Echo 5/5- Satch closes with this remarkable epic song, also very underrated. It is such a majestic song with a very beautiful chord progression. In this song, he does a great job mixing shred and emotion. THere are times when he shreds, but also many times where he's singing from the bottom of his heart through his guitar. One of my very favorite Satch songs. <br /> <br />This is my favorite Joe Satriani album. It is so diverse with meoldy, emotion, and shred. For people just discovering music, I suggest you pick this one or The Extremist up. For people looking for shred, this one has some of his most shredding on one album. But if you're looking for Malmsteen senseless monotonous speed, then this isn't the album or artist for you. If you're looking for melody and emotion, this album is drenched in it. This album is so diverse that no matter what kind of guitarist you are, you can always get something from this album or any Satch album for that matter.
B0002S64OG|5.0|I got this for my 13 month old, and it is BY FAR the best baby DVD out there. It is very well organized, and the repetitive nature of the scenes and introductions of words is very effective in getting my son to repeat the animal names. The animated nursery rhymes, mixed in with the moving toys, really holds his attention too, and has him bouncing to the beat. Great!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie really is as huge as the hype has made it out to be. First it's really the first gay love story (if you want to call it a love story) to go mainstream, second it's got two pulitzer prize winners and Ang Lee involved, third it's got the best acting I have ever seen on film, and when you mix everything together you get the most professional adaptation of a written work I wouldn't want to say ever done, but it certainly might be.<br /><br />You probably know the story by now, so I won't go on with plot summeries, but I will tell you what made me attend this film 4 times at the theater:<br /><br />As an English major this movie was like literary heaven. After the first time I watched it I was blown away by all the foreshadow, symbolism, parallels, and poetric transitions that this film did perfectly. For instance, Jack always misses what he \\"shoots\\" (coyote, deer) but Ennis hits them. In a sense Ennis has \\"hit\\" Jack, but Jack can never really \\"hit\\" Ennis.<br /><br />At the end of one scene Alma throws down mail and the camera captures an ad for Honey. In the next seen Jack says \\"Honey\\" to his wife. What a great Poetic transition!<br /><br />There are many parallels, most notably that embrace from behind. Jack and Ennis do it twice, once while in the motel and another during the flashback when Jack is \\"sleeping like a horse.\\" Alma also embraces Ennis from behind in the first bedroom scene when she wants to move into town. Even the their two shirts together in the end can be considered an embrace from behind.<br /><br />Jack foreshadows his outcome by wearing purple in one scene.<br /><br />I could go on and on and on with all the fun English and Literary goodies I found by watching the movie--trust me, I took pen and paper into the theater and filled up 5 front-and-back pages of notes. But I think I can summerize how I feel about this film by simply saying it is outstanding, and will always be considered Best Picture no matter what the Oscars have to say.have to say. <br />

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Yes, this film has its flaws, as all remakes do, but it sticks to the main story, and that is what attracts Austen lovers to it.  If you are a real fan, then you will gobble this one up just as you have done the other ones that came out.  At first I did not see Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet either, and the fact that Hollywood could see anyone else as Darcy nearly made me go crazy, but these actors did a great job.  It's a different take and a very well done version for a new audience.  And yes, I have read the book ten million times and own the BBC A&E version.
B00005Y228|5.0|If 'Light Years' was the album that put Kylie back on the pop landscape, then 'FEVER' is the album that solidified Kylie as disco's most loved and pretentious diva--Fever made Kylie a superstar (again). While this album may not be Kylie's best compared to the landmark 'Impossible Princess', 'Fever' is an electro-pop confection that will leave you wanting more as the last song ends. Fever is an all out dance record. Don't look or substance or depth--it's all about FUN FUN FUN! <br /> <br />Kylie, being the showgirl that she is mixes up a concoction of pulsating dance beats to heat up the dancefloor. 1st single 'Cant Get You Out Of My Head' is unarguably one of the best songs of the millenium, the catchiest and hypnotizing in a while. 'In Your Eyes' is a faux dance ditty that is dizzying, swirling full of bubbly synths and tight beats. 'Love At First Sight' is reminiscent of Daft Punk's 'One More Time', already an instant Kylie classic, you'll be dancing and singing along after a few listens. 'Fragile' and 'Come Into My World' offer a look into Kylie's mysterious and sexy persona as she seduces you and coos in the most purring and provocative ways amidst a mystic backdrop of filtered strings, crazy bleeps and throbbing drums. While 'Burning Up' starts with a lazy guitar progression then leads into a frenzied euphoria. However my favorite moment in the album is 'Your Love' a laid-down affair (but still danceable!) complete with Spanish Guitars which makes Kylie's unsynthesized voice as the centerpiece of the yearning piece. I recommend this album to pop, dance and euro-music lovers alike. I guarantee this will not disappoint.

B0007GAERG|5.0|THIS CD IS HOT. I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT I AM NOT ONLY A FAN OF HERS NOW BUT I THINK I'M IN LOVE. I OWN JUST TWO OF HER OLDER CD'S BUT I'M GOING BACK TO GET THE REST.

BUT BEWARE SHE BELONGS TO ME NOW LOL. RUN RUN TO THE STORE AND GET THIS ONE IT IS A SURE THING BABY!!
0393317552|1.0|Loved the topic, and I thought this would be an interesting read. I got through half the book, and now it's been collecting dust for weeks. Too much detail on the domestication of crops and animals. It never seemed to get off the ground before I lost interest.
6304493681|4.0|This is an incredibly conceived animation. I'm intirgued by how it has been dubbed into english, there are lots of blank spaces in the dialogue and stillness in the image that I'm guessing might come from a more involved Japanese original. The effect is that sometimes the pace looses dynamism, All in all though its an astounding vision and what really mkes it is the depth of the surround sound track, alongside some really great drawing of course.
B000001IPL|5.0|It's practically been 12 years and this is still the best Offspring CD and arguably the best \\"punk\\" cd. With the AMAZING guitar riffs and nice drum skills, this CD is worth listening to. You can also hear the bass unlike other poser bands. Buy this CD for the following AMAZING tracks: <br />-Nitro(youth energy) <br />-Gotta Get Away <br />-Genocide <br />-Come Out And Play <br />-Self Esteem <br />-Smash <br /> <br />All the rest of the songs are amazing but are not \\"perfect.\\" This CD is for everyone of all ages, this is Punk Rock at its HIGHEST PEAK.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|I was looking forward to this film and just saw the film.  And let me tell you that I was disappointed.  I have a rule that films over 2 and a half hours, every minute needs to add to the story.  This film has an overabundance atmosphere. <br /> <br />The first hour is one long exposition.  Nothing really happens, you get to meet the cast in detail.  It shows the depression and thirties NYC accurately but this is not neccesary for the story.  This should have been only 20 minutes. <br /> <br />The second hour is Skull Island.  Again everything is overdone here.  There are some awesome special effects but they go on and on.  But here I do give credit to some of the best CGI I have ever seen.  About 90% of the live and CGI mesh perfectly to the point you cannot really tell that it is CGI.  The dinosaurs and Kong had depth and weight. Virtually every other film, the CGI never seemed real because there was no appearance of physical weight to the beings.  They seemed to be floating.  In KK they actually look like they are walking and running. <br /> <br />Now with that said, I must go back to the point that much of the scenes here are overly long.  The scene where the raptors attack the brontosaurs goes on forever (I admit it was great but long).  The scene where the guys are attacked by slugs and bugs at the bottom of the ravine has absolutely no point other than to have more special effects.  Even the scene where Kong saves Naomi from the T-Rex's is incredibly overdone.  He kills each of the three T-Rex's at least three times! <br /> <br />The best scenes are purely with Kong and the girl.  Naiomi Watts is great and this is the only time that I wanted the film to go on.  As a matter of fact, I wish the film was almost of Kong and the girl. <br /> <br />The last hour was back in NYC and was actually just a little long but the story changes lessened the impact. <br /> <br />If you want to see the best go back to the original. <br />

Everything about Michael's legendary life is disclosed. The way he makes music, how he learned to dance, his hobbies, his friends and much more. As he told Oprah in 1993, he if you want to learn about all of the private aspects of his life pick up \\"Moonwalk\\".

B000EGF0B4|5.0|Two Thumps Up!!!! Finally a movie that tells the story Of what real love can be... (be your male or female, gay Or Straight)This movie isn't about being gay or straight IT'S ABOUT LOVE...... And heartache, I felt the pain On both sides of the men and women in the film And the price to pay if you don't follow your heart and live a lie, just because you want the world to except you Yes! two men can fall In Love (and It's not all About SEX)and what people think is right or wrong BUT I think everyone should watch this movie with an open Mind And Heart Strange but two woman can be in Love BUT Not two men Doesn't sound fair to me A heart is a heart , And love is Love Be you're two men , two women Or male and female
1594200653|5.0|About the best one-volume work I've seen that spans Europe's changes from 1945 to the end of the century. Judt does not neglect the long shadow that WWII still cast on the period -- the postwar doubts and guilt, and Judt keeps it distinct from the East-West divide that also dated from then. Highly recommend.
015603008X|4.0|Charlie Gordon a mentally retarded thirty-two- year-old man is chosen by two scientists Dr. Strauss who performs the experimental operation, and Professor Nemor the scientist in charge of the experiment to under go an experimental surgery designed to enhance his intelligence. Charlie was recommended for the experiment by Alice Kinnian Charlie's teacher at the Beekman College Center for Retarded Adults because of his eagerness to learn. After the experiment is done Charlie is asked to keep a journal and the entire book is composed of the \\"Progress Reports\\" Charlie writes.  <br /> <br />The thing that kept me cursing through the book was the problems he faces due to the experiment, his improvement in the way he thinks before and after the experiment. And weather or not will last. One of the quotes that I personally like is  <br /> <br />\\"And I hate school! I hate it! I'll stop studying and I'll be dummy like him. She runs out of the room shrieking: \\"It's happening to me already... I'm forgetting everything... I don't remember anything I learned any more.\\" <br /> <br />This quote comes from progress report 12 one of Charlie's flashbacks to his childhood. Norma Charlie's sister wants her parents to give her a dog because she received an A on her history exam. After her father tells her no because she refuses to allow Charlie to help care for it. Norma feels that Charlie receives special treatment because he is retarded so she says that if she becomes a \\"dummy\\" then she'll get special treatment as well. Although Norma was being absurd and sarcastic it seems for that moment she envies her brother's disability this is the only time throughout the book where Charlie's retardation is perceived as an advantage. Charlie's disability makes his sister miserable. <br /> <br />Norma's remark \\"I don't remember anything I learned anymore.\\" Is a joke to upset her parents also foreshadows what happens to Charlie at the end of the book.  <br /> <br />I hope you enjoyed my review and want to read this book. This book has various lessons that can be leaned. The one that stands out the most to me is the unfairness of life. Charlie was treated unfair before the operation because his mind wasn't as fast as many people his age.  He was treated unfair after the operation because of his rapid increase in intelligence people thought he was even weirder because of the operation. Also he is treated unfairly because of all things he has to go through, through out the book.   <br />
B000BB1MI2|2.0|As a fan of not only Johnny Depp, but Tim Burton as well, I could not wait to see what they had done for this classic that I remember from my childhood. If you are like me, thirty-something and have kids, DO NOT purchase this DVD. Purchase the original from 1971. This version is dark, extremely weird and seems to be the movie that should never have been made. I cannot fathom what Tim Burton was thinking. Did his head get so big that he had to ruin this? Johnny Depp plays a weird, dark and almost child molester-type character. He reminds me of the exact way that perhaps Michael Jackson would play this role. No history, no soul.... just an empty, scary and weird attempt to capture money from an unsuspecting public. The EXACT opposite of the feeling that the original gave you. The 1971 version gave you hope, smiles and tears. This new version just gave me a weird feeling and made me wonder about Wonka's intentions with children. Really! It was that horrible! I am guessing that both Depp and Burton had never seen the original as a child. Any six or seven year old would just be scared of these characters, not delighted as they would be with Gene Wilder! Stay away, stay far away!
B000B2YQX4|4.0|playing the angel is o.k....but their older stuff is far better <br />their live shows are cool, they play a mix of old and new.this record has only 3 or 4 hits....nothing more- mid to late 80's still the best.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I'm seriousally laughing at some of these dudes that give this album a negitive rating. One dude basically says this album is a throw away, and he's a big Brooks and Dunn's fan so you know he has poor taste in music. <br /> <br />Another dude attacks this album but likes mediocre 90's hip hop and says hip hop is about being original.. Yeah, sampling others songs is really original. ANother is a fan of popstars. So keep in mind to  <br />read the reviews of the people giving negitive reviews here. They'll make you laugh with some of the crappy stuff they enjoy. <br /> <br />Only one throw away here and that's the spainish influenced song. The rest is some of the best Prince has done since the early 90's.
B00000K19E|3.0|I'm confused, is the Matrix I saw the same one that everyone has been raving about? You know, the one with Neo, Trinity, the Agents and a decimated earth of the future controlled by robots. Are they both the same movies? They are? Wow, what a let down. Don't get me wrong, I really like the idea behind this movie and the CGI was nothing sort of amazing. Even the acting was sort of good. That's not what I had a problem with. The problem is in the details.<br /><br />The first problem I had was that all the con-fu hand to hand fighting was really, REALLY, fake. It's down right laughable at the end when Neo is fighting agent Smith in the hallway. It was just one of the dumbest things I had ever seen.<br /><br />Another problem I had was that the movie was just too short. I mean one minute Neo is freaking out about being pulled out of the Matrix, the next he's dodging bullets and killing whole swat teams. The movie would have been much better if it had just been a little lounger.<br /><br />My last complaint is a miner one but one I feel almost ruined the movie for me. I thought that the real world was going to have nothing to do with earth or what is in the Matrix, so I was very disappointed to find out the \\"real world\\" was really earth in the future. It would have been much better if, instead of taking shortcuts, the directors of this film would have actually created a completely different would with different laws of nature and everything.<br /><br />I will not deny that this is a good movie, but it is not in any way a masterpiece or worth spending $20 on. Take my advice and rent this movie before even thinking about buying it.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Previous poster (J. Young) is an idiot. Since when do you assess a film based solely on entertainment value? If that's the case, Michael Bay is a genius. I mean really, get a life man. Films just don't seem to be your thing, based on your condescending opinions towards them. As for the film, it's pretty much a masterpiece. By the way, I had your wife . . . she's not that good.

B000EGDC0A|4.0|This record has a sound like no other. Goldfrapp has done a phenomenal job of putting together a smooth and brilliant sound that is perfect for lounging to at a cocktail party, listening to on a treadmill, listening to while lounging on a couch, or blaring on a crowded dance floor. <br />The sound is difficult to label, electro-synth heavy, with vocals that range from soft to husky. The tracks are both up- and down-tempo, with stnad outs including \\"Ride a White Horse\\", \\"Slide In\\" and \\"Satin Chic\\" (my personal favorite).  <br />This is one of the most memorable and repeat-listen worthy records I have heard since Kylie's Fever and Gwen Stefani's Love Angel Music Baby. The genre is electro-dance, but fans of pop, rock and lounge music will fall in love with the sound and catchy beats of Goldfrapp.

0446677450|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It gives yet another perspective on the class you find yourself in and what other classes of people choose to do. When reading this book, you may find yourself thinking that everything you are doing is wrong, or unwise. Just remember, that in the end, all of life is choices. If you choose to manage your resources as suggested in this book, that is a choice. You may have to sacrifice time with your family and friends. If you choose to live poor, perhaps you will have more time with people, but when you pass on you will not leave behind any material items, assets. These are thoughts to consider when you finish reading this book.
B0002YLC24|5.0|See my review for Before Sunrise.  Before Sunset is a perfect sequel to before Sunrise.  A lovely love story.
B0002NRQTS|5.0|(This is a review of the original album as it was releaed in 1989, but I can't imagine remastering it as being a bad thing.)       For sixteen years, Ged, Lerxst and Pratt (sorry John Rutsey) had been growing and changing, each new record becoming exponentially more sophisticated than its predecessor. Synth washes started to come to the forefront on Signals, then began to slowly, but surely dominate the band's sound for the remainder of the decade. Which isn't to say that the quality of their records dropped off, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire all had their highlights, but the band's soul was starting to get as cold as the machines they controlled.         Enter, Presto. Rush, armed with a new label (Atlantic) and a new producer (Rupert Hine), once again embraced just how good they were as a hard rock combo, and bravely shed much of the technocratic mumbo-jumbo. They were veteran performers who had a decades' worth of experience in what can send shivers down an audience's spine and what can pump them up to the point of, well, banging their heads and laughing with pure joy. They were also smart, packing one of rock's most evocative lyricists, not to mention more jazzy, twirling riffs than you can shake a really big stick at!        And, bless their hearts, they ran with it! Creating their most mature, yet most rocking album to date. Gone are epics like \\"Natural Science\\", \\"Freewill\\", \\"The Trees\\" et al. In  their place stand eleven glorious slices of what I can only describe as \\"Hard Rock For Grown Ups.\\"        The band's playing is as inspired and dynamic as ever, but it's all in service to the songs, instead of showy prog-pieces. Geddy Lee's bass crackles like an electric spark, but he's wise enough to know when to back off. Alex Lifeson is one of rock's most criminally underrated guitarists, and his razor-sharp performance here shows how far he's come since \\"Cygnus X-1\\". He's not the only one, Neil Peart seems to have finally learned to control his massive drum kit, rather than vice-versa, he plays his guts out here, but never seems showy, he's `in the pocket' and he never leaves it. There's a lot of synth work here, but for the first time since `Signals' it serves the band instead of directing it.        \\"Show Don't Tell\\" kicks things off with a terse, squalling blast from Lifeson's guitar, then rumbles into life like a clockwork puzzle gone wrong as Lee and Peart's rhythm section try to hold on as the song starts to slip and slide. Geddy's funky, popping and slapping bass solo's worth the price of admission. \\"Chain Lightning\\" stomps into life with a deep bass line poised over Peart's crackling snare, with Lifeson twirling around him before they all dig in and start to rock out. The title track is a tiny masterpiece, with Lifeson's increasingly busy acoustic strumming balanced over Lee's warm, simple bass and Peart's snappy drums. \\"Red Tide\\" is one of  the band's best songs, starting out with a `Power Windows'-era synth blast, then settling down into a brooding piano and bass melody that Lifeson's insistent guitar and Peart's seething drumming slowly begin to push into a corner, the chorus is to die for. \\"Available Light\\", the album's closer, is a moody, bluesy affair, Lifeson's guitar crying softly in the corner as Lee's warm bass and gentle piano fondlings lead into a classic Rush-o-phonic chorus with Peart's tasty snare fill.       The album's masterpiece is \\"The Pass\\", a terse, but elegantly phrased meditation on suicide and the mess that it leaves behind that starts out with a pair of sharp, sliding bass chords from Lee, then begins to slowly evolve into the band's best song in ages. It's here that Rush show us how far they've grown, with Lee's bass snarling softly in the background as his newfound, soulful voice sings Peart's best lyrics to date. Lifeson's guitar shines like a pack of fresh razor blades, his solo all the more devastating for it's simplicity, and all the while Peart's drums purr,snap, and crash at all the right moments.         Did I mention the electric \\"Superconductor\\", the swooning \\"Anagram (For Mongo), the meditative \\"Scars\\" or...well, screw it, buy the CD and you'll see.        This is progressive hard rock with real heart and soul. It's smart, but not brainy or condescending, emotional without being sappy or indulgent, and, most importantly, it rocks! This is Rush at the height of the powers, having the time of their lives.
B00002E224|5.0|I rented Before Sunrise and Before Sunset and I was so entranced by these movies,I purchased both of them through Amazon.  I believe a great deal of the dialogue was improvised or written by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke.

This film is beautifully done and the scenery is breathtaking.  It is a gift to the world.  As a straight white married women I learned that gay love is as powerful and beautiful as mine is for my husband.  I learned so much.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|When I saw Crash early last year, I felt throughout 2005 that it was one of the best films of that year.  However, when I saw Brokeback Mountain late in 2005, I was convinced that it was not only the greatest film of the year, but the most unforgettable film of my lifetime, and if you allow it to, this film can and will transform your life.  The performances, the haunting music, and breathtaking cinematography are the most genius I've ever seen on film.  Every movie I've seen since Brokeback Mountain has paled in comparison.  To truly understand and appreciate this work of art in cinematic history, you need a certain level of intelligence and sensitivity.  Unfortunately, we don't all have that, and we can't open our minds wide enough without being afraid.  When I left the theatre, I felt completely devastated, but soon, this was replaced with a passion for life that I'd never felt before.  And if you watch with an open heart, it will do the same for you.
0553801503|4.0|My first inclination is to defend my favorite author with a fiery brand waving in the air, but the reality is that this book is not for everyone.   <br />Cursory fans will often find themselves bogged down in the characters and slow plot.  While it is unfair to say that nothing happens, the events are often more subtle than an indifferent reader is going to care to see.   <br />The strength of Feast, as in most of Martin's writing, is the character development.  I admit that at times the story seems slower than need be, but even then we are getting to see a little deeper into the people who we've grown to care about.   <br />The biggest problem this book suffers from is that many of the characters are newly introduced as viewpoints.  We came to the table expecting one dish and we got a different one.  The characters are wonderful, once we get to know them, however at first the question that keeps going through the mind is, \\"Who invited Brienne to the table?\\" <br />All in all the feast is good, but it seems to simply make us hungrier for a more eventful meal than to quench our hunger.
B00003CXXP|3.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on the short story \\"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\\" as well as on a screen story.<br /><br />As a very brief synopsis, the movie occurs in the future when global warming is having an effect on the planet.  The movie begins with a discussion between Professor Hobby (William Hurt) and his students on artificial intelligence (the development of machines or programs capable of humanlike thought processes).  The professor announces that an artificial boy will be built who has the capacity to love.  Then we are introduced to this artificial or \\"Mecha\\" (mechanical) boy named David (Haley Joel Osment) who becomes part of a real organic or \\"orga\\" mother and father family. The mother then programs him for unconditional love (that is, to love her no matter what).  However, things don't work out and David is abandoned to fend for himself believing that if he becomes real, the mother will want him back.  Befriended by a streetwise \\"love\\" Mecha named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), the rest of the story is about David searching for the \\"Blue Fairy\\" who he believes has the power to make him real.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is fantastic.  Osment (who was thirteen years old at the time) carries the movie quite well as the artificial boy David.  Jude Law's character of Gigolo Joe is quite interesting.<br /><br />I feel the background music is exceptional.  The movie is also technically superb with amazing images and special effects.<br /><br />Despite all the good things about this movie, I feel it has some problems:<br /><br />(1) The story.  The great Stanley Kubrick (known for his dark movies) worked on this project for a dozen years before his death and along the way decided to let Steven Spielberg direct.  (Spielberg is known for his cutesy, hopeful movies.)  The two collaborated for years resulting in Kubrick giving Spielberg considerable artistic leeway for this movie before his death.  This collaboration shows.  The movie begins (after a brief introduction) as hopeful and cutesy or, in other words, Spielbergish, then gets dark or Kubrickish, then its conclusion (which takes place in the far, far future) is Spielbergish again.  This resulted in an uneven story.<br /><br />(2) I had trouble feeling for an artificial boy.  The result was that this movie, to be sure, was interesting but boring.  Its long length also contributed to it being boring.<br /><br />(3) Spielberg added a character of \\"Teddy,\\" a \\"supertoy\\" and teddy bear that can walk and talk.  It becomes David's companion.  I know this movie is supposed to be a fairy tale but I found this character really, really annoying and even distracting.<br /><br />Thus, this movie can be described as a \\"flawed masterpiece.\\"  That is, it's technically brilliant but with story problems.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to hardcore sci-fi fantasy fans.  Despite the teddy bear, it is definitely not for children.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (Special Edition) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a host of extras that mostly concentrate on the technical aspects of this movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, Steven Spielberg described this movie as a \\"future fairy tale.\\"  If you like such movies, then this is the movie to see!!<br /><br />*** 1/2<br /><br />(2001;  2 hr, 25 min;  2 discs;  wide screen;  32 scenes)<br /><br />+++++rief introduction) as hopeful and cutesy or, in other words, Spielbergish, then gets dark or Kubrickish, then its conclusion (which takes place in the far, far future) is Spielbergish again.

It has a host of extras that mostly concentrate on the technical aspects of this movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, Steven Spielberg described this movie as a \\"future fairy tale.\\"  If you like such movies, then this is the movie to see!!<br /><br />*** 1/2<br /><br />(2001;  2 hr, 25 min;  2 discs;  wide screen;  32 scenes)<br /><br />+++++
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Warm, touching and inspiring, Brokeback shares many similarities to last years masterpiece Million Dollar Baby. They just move you in a profound way while showing you two people are capable of changing each others lives.  <br /> <br />In Million dollar baby, Frankie and Maggie have nothing, no family, nothing, but together they form a wonderful father daughter relationship which changes each others lives. Frankie doesn't just turn Maggie into a great boxer, but Maggie revives Frankie's ability to connect with someone. <br /> <br /> They both help each other psychically and emotionally. Ennis and Jack do a similar thing for each other. Ennis is a quiet, hurt man from a broken family with no reason for living really. But when Jack arrives, all of that changes for the better and for the worse. They both bring light into each others lives but the harsh realities make their mark. Both left me in a state of awe for weeks and raised my passion for human connection. Two people can make life worth living and both masterpieces have taught me that. I have now made a connection with a wonderful girl at my school thanks to these two masterpieces. I have seen the light of human connection.  <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Brokeback will never have the honor of being the academy award winner for best pictur. But the film has made it's mark on many lives an A subjective award will never change that. This movie was announced on dvd yesterday and already many people, affected by it personally have come here to share those feelings with fellow fans. That is what movies are for in my opinion. To generate all your deepest feelings and inspire you to persue them and share them with fellow humans.  <br /> <br />I'm glad my favorite movie of 05 has made it's mark on so many people. I'd like to thank the makers of million dollar baby and Brokeback mountain for breaking new grounds while teaching me human connection can make life worth living but also have it's negative affects. The best film of 05 and perhaps this century. No stars can justify my love for this film.
0792163710|5.0|Shane has such great & noble themes.  I used to think The Searchers was the best western, but Shane beats it hands down. <br />(#2 isn't bad.)  I'm glad I got it.  Good acting & beautiful scenery make it a good movie to see.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|I have watched numerous war films and seriosly thought there would be some kind of enemy battle in the second part of this film.. nothing! This is certainly different for a blockbuster. Another thing, is at times it had a documentary feel to it; which is fine by me. The main thing is that everything worked out well with the good news that they(troops)were going back home. That was reason enough for them to celebrate, drink some booze and be thankfull; good for all of them!

B00003JRCQ|5.0|If period dramas are your thing, then do see this fantastic adaptation of Ms. Austen's Persuasion, starring Amanda Root and Cirian Hinds.  Ms. Root wonderfully portrays the disillusioned yet romantic Anne, and captures the essence of her being, which you can see in the touching metamorphosis she goes through, both  touching and empoworing. Mr. Hinds brings subtlety to the dashing Captain Wentworth and the sense of reserve and resentment he harbors for Anne is all but broken through his acquaitance with her.  But the beauty of the film lies in the way it presents British society, and the interaction between the classes for power, love and money. The supporting cast brilliantly contrasts the fickleness and superficiality of the titled, with the more greagarious, engaging, and friendly non-titled-- the rich landowners, the educated, the Navy, and the working class...   <br /> <br />This gem of a film brought to us by BBC Films is beautifully shot, and the restraint that true lovers have with one another is one of the most poignant episodes in the rocky courtship between Anne and Wentworth.   <br /> <br />Less comedic than Ms. Austen's other works, Persuasion really is about knowing what you want, and be pursuaded to pursue your happiness. <br /> <br />I loved this film for its beautiful lighting, its dialogue,and the way it depicted relationships between people, romance, courtship and marriage, and ultimately society and social etiquette in the 19th century.   <br /> <br />I hope you will too.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|For all of you reviewers who are saying the Beatles suck, are overrated, etc., my guess is that y'all were born after 1980.  If you read your history books, you'd realize that none of the other bands that you claim to be better would have even existed were it not for the Beatles and their trailblazing success.  Saying the Beatles are overrated is like saying that Shakespeare was prone to using cliches, that Beethoven lacked imagination, that Kenny G could outplay John Coltrane if he were alive today, or that Stephon \\"Starbury\\" Marbury is the best point guard in the NBA.  You have no idea what you are talking about!  You have to evaluate the music in the correct context.  Why do you think so many of today's great rock musicians cite Robert Johnson as one of their primary influences or the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" as one of the greatest rock albums of all time?  These people understand and appreciate the roots of rock music.  The next time you run into Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Bono, or the Beastie Boys, tell them that the Beatles suck and see how they react.  Do your homework before showing the public how ignorant you are!
B0000C9ZSV|5.0|BEING THAT THIS IS HENDRIX AND ANYTHING RELEASED IS WORTHY OF AT LEAST 5 STARS, DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK THAT MOST OF THIS SHOW IS DRASTICALLY OUT OF TUNE? I PICKED UP THE UNOFFICIAL 1ST SHOW AND THAT WAS JUST AS BAD (PROBABLY WORSE). JIMI PROBABLY JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TRADE OUT GUITARS IN THE MIDDLE OF METALLIC KNEE-CAPS (FOXEY LADY) BUT IT GETS TO BE QUITE UNBEARABLE AT PARTS. I WOULD THINK THAT OF ALL THE RECORDINGS EVER CAPTURED, EXPERIENCE HENDRIX WOULD RELEASE SOMETHING A LITTLE TIGHTER BY THE GYPSYS. PROBABLY WHY THE 1ST SHOW HAS NEVER SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY, HOPEFULY SOMETHING EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN THE 2ND SHOW WILL BE PRESENTED INSTEAD.

B000003CMB|5.0|This is the finest piece of live southen rock/jazz/blues ever laid down and it is recorded in the highest of fidelity by legendary master engineer Tom Dowd (see \\"The Language of Music DVD\\").  Taken together with the other Fillmore East tracks, Mountain Jam, One Way Out and Trouble no More, from Eat a Peach, you get the best example of what happens when a band achieves the highest form of unity of mind and purpose.  I consider myself one of the lucky people to have witnessed the original Allman Brothers Band perform on September 18, 1971 in Dayton Ohio, just five months after the Fillmore East concerts and five weeks prior to Duane Allman's death.  They played the entire Fillmore East repertoire.  The Fillmore East album had been released just weeks before and we had already worn the vinyl down on our copy as well as the previous two albums prior to the concert.  Without reservation I can honestly say I have never seen a band since that night that has played with such spirit and togetherness.  It is hard to put into words how great the original Allman Brothers were in concert, but this album and the live cuts from Eat a Peach capture it perfectly.  Do not even take a second thought about buying this album.

The book is a great read but be warned it does contain spoilers. Fantastic behind the scenes facts, and full information on various cast members who have played the parts since its opening. A must to go with the Wicked sound track .

078322933X|5.0|This is a great movie and one of my favorites. I watched this movie back in 2002 and bought it a couple of months ago when I saw it at Wal-Mart. The acting is great-- Reese Witherspoon & Mark Walhberg. Highly recommended.  <br />
0385334206|4.0|Reading a plot summary of this book might tell you what to expect, but Breakfast of Champions isn't worth reading for the plot.  Read this book if you have enjoyed Slaugheterhouse-Five and Cat's Cradle and you want to go deeper into Vonnegut's ideas. <br /> <br />The themes that dominate some of Vonnegut's other works -- religion, war, the interconnectedness of humanity -- are a backdrop here for exploration of the relationship of an author to his subject.  Vonnegut is the creator of the narrator-character, who is the creator of Kilgore Trout (the \\"eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe\\"), who is in a sense the creator of Dwayne Hoover.   <br /> <br />This theme is the context for one of Vonnegut's constant preoccupations, the question of free will vs. determinism (or \\"machinery\\").  This question is treated very ambiguously in Breakfast of Champions.  Vonnegut's meaning is obscured by layers of satire.  The narrator nakedly and repeatedly espouses the view that people are just machines, but this view is undermined at the end through the reader's reaction to Dwayne Hoover's insane rampage.  And in the Epilogue, when Trout meets the narrator, the narrator describes in detail his machine-like reflexes to danger, and tells Trout exactly what will happen to him in the future, but he also \\"frees\\" Trout and gives him a symbolic apple -- a common representation of the beginning of free will.  I think the best triangulation of his true position is the explanation of the ridiculous art by Rabo Karabedian, \\"an unwavering band of light\\" within a machine-body that is a slave to determinism, but Karabedian himself is one of the most ridiculed characters in a ridiculous cast.  No matter what conclusion you draw from these scenes, the determinism-free will issue is brilliantly connected to Vonnegut's explanation of various evils of modern American life (or is it really evil, if it's just \\"bad chemicals\\"?). <br /> <br />Breakfast of Champions is Vonnegut's meta-novel.  Comprehension of it is enriched by knowledge of Vonnegut's other interconnected works (plenty of parallels to \\"Listen:  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time\\"), and it's not really the place to start in the Vonnegut universe.  But there is a wealth of satire and symbolism here to unpack, hidden within a funny and fast-moving story.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|For me to admitt to rocking out to Phil Collins the other day takes a lot of guts, and sometimes I feel like his youngest fan (I just turned 21 on St. Paddy's day!) and so beings that my current CD rotation consists of Method Man, Lamb of God, Staind and Keyshia Cole, to add Phil Collins to that mix seems kinda odd (then again Keyshia Cole and Lamb of God...I guess my taste are a bit mixed) anyways...I will admitt that yesterday I finally unwrapped the CD that I had regretted buying, the one that I purchased for some music to play at my parents 25th wedding anniversary and so I decided that I'd give it a test listen...and I actually found myself enjoying myself about 3 tracks in...once he got into 'Easy Lover' and I found my head uncontollably bobbing (I never BOB)  I will admitt that I have always loved 'In the air tonight' but that was the only song I thought I'd enjoy...I mean, isn't Phil Collins the Tarzan guy?  But after listening to this CD front to back I can honestly say (oh my god here it is) that I am a Phil Collins fan...crap...too late...can't take it back.  Easily the best track here is 'Against all Odds' which (bless my soul) I had only heard once before, performed on American Idol (I know I know...what the hell) and even though I liked the song I had never really though \\"I could listen to Phil Collins\\" but after hearing his version of the song I actually replayed it about three times and it is still playing in the back of my mind.  Phil Collins has a one of a kind voice, one that sucks you into every verse.  Songs like 'I Wish It Would Rain Down' really showcase his talent which is enormous.  I would recomend this CD to anyone who is a fan of Phil because it has all of his hits (every track here is listenable, some more than others) and I even recomend this to any lover of music (like myself) because if you truly LOVE music in general then you will appreciate this CD for the talent that is Phil Collins!  (Now why isn't the Tarzan song on here?)
B000BRBA8S|4.0|I know I'm in the minority here, but 2046 impressed me more than In the Mood For Love despite its longeurs and flat patches, which may be blasphemy for most Wong Kar-Wei fans. It helps that it's mixed reception didn't encourage me to expect too much of this almost sequel.     It's not emotionally moving, but that's probably intentional: this is, after all, a story of a man in a state of emotional denial, and it makes no excuses for his selfishness. But nor does it paint him purely in one color: the film's strength is that the character evolves and changes at different points in time and in different relationships - just because he's no good for one person doesn't mean he's bad for another (but then that could just be the fact that the gorgeous Faye Wong just brings out the best in men... sorry, I was drifting off subject there for a moment). Zhang Ziyi, whose previous one-note petulant performances had me dreading her role here, actually is quite a revelation, showing an emotional range, vulnerability and likeability totally lacking in her previous films to have got western releases.     It's not the exuberant Wong of Chungking Express or Fallen Angels, and the layered, sometimes ambivalently drifting nature of the film isn't to all tastes, but ultimately it hit more often than it missed for me.    The extras package on this Sony release is particularly good - 2 long deleted scenes and a brief alternate ending, a 38-minute making of, and interview featurette with Wong Kar Wei, Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi, production featurette, although the absence of any of the film's trailers is surprising.
B00009V7P8|4.0|Damien Rice is a truly inspiring and unique singer/songwriter.  It's almost as if you can hear pain in his voice.  He's brilliant.
B00005BKZJ|3.0|Bagdad Café aka Out of Rosenheim is a German film although it's set in the Mojave Desert with only two Germans in the cast. In a way it's a distant relation of the wave of 70s German independent films starring faded American stars or directors (think Wim Wenders' work with Nicholas Ray and Dennis Hopper for an example) with a touch of magical realism thrown into the comic mix. A big hit in its day, time has been less kind to it and it veers more towards the irritating and overdrawn than the charming as it progresses. The major problem is the slightness of the material, with Marianne Sagebracht's displaced German housefrau doing an underplayed Mary Poppins act on the miserable and worn out employees and hangers on around the dilapidated roadside cafe and motel she finds herself in. Thanks to an open heart, a talent for housework and a box of magic tricks, she turns it into a burgeoning cabaret truckstop venue, bringing out the best in everyone around her (well, except one who leaves because there's \\"too much harmony.\\").<br /><br />Unfortunately, this transformation is very long in coming and less than convincing when it does, and en route Percy Adlon doesn't offer enough development to justify the overlong running time. In fact, the characters are pretty thin all round - a frighteningly genial Jack Palance prowls around in the kind of leather and snakeskin wardrobe that creaks more than he does but is never really given much to do beyond prowling and painting, while CCH Pounder spends so much of the movie as a spectacularly unpleasant and increasingly less credible total misery that you wonder why the hell Sagebracht sticks around. Too many scenes outstay their welcome or simply go over the same ground, and the constant use of the same mournful song over almost every scene regardless of mood gets beyond grating.<br /><br />It has its moments and its heart is in the right place, but a sharper script and a tighter running time would have made a world of difference.

B000E97HIA|3.0|I like the CD and if not for Te Amo Corazon I just might like it much more. I do believe it is worth the buy. Problem is with Prince's albums is that they do not match his live shows. For those who ask \\"where is the funk\\" pick up One Nite Alone...Live! box set and you will see and hear. Prince still does and has always matched his genius funk from the 80's. Prince and his band are the best going today.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I saw the episode of Still Standing where Renee did the musical number at the end of the show & thought to myself 'this can't be real - how can that style & voice be coming from a woman that young'. Was I wrong - she is for real, the talent is for real and listening to this CD is nothing but pure pleasure! I hope Renee stays in the music scene - and television - for many years to come so that I may continue enjoy what she offers.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|When I finally decided to take a look at the movie \\"Serenity\\", I did my usual skimming of the Amazon & Yahoo reviews to see what other folks thought before I fed Blockbuster more of my moola.   <br /> <br />Sheesh!  Based on these reviews, I decided Serenity had to be either the greatest thing since \\"The Matrix\\", or the worst piece of dreck since Hollywood mangled Michael Crichton's great novel, \\"Timeline\\". <br /> <br />So I offered my greenbacks as a sacrifice to the almighty blue & yellow regurged-movie god to see for myself.  Well, it's neither 5-star slobber-worthy nor 1-star venom-worthy(though the Amazon 5-stars DO weigh in at a healthy 77% of the ratings).   <br /> <br />All of that jibber-jabber to get to this:  <br /> <br />IMHO, \\"Serenity\\" was a VERY GOOD, refreshing, 4-star movie on the Amazon scale and an \\"A-\\" on the Yahoo scale.  Here's what I liked about the movie: <br /> <br />1. The MAIN characters were not cookie-cutter, two-dimensional, morally-unambiguous \\"good-guys\\" & \\"bad guys\\".  The crew of Serenity(namely Captain Mal) often had to do some morally questionable things just to survive, which rings so true in this morally ambiguous world of ours.  How utterly refreshing to see fictional characters behave the way \\"real\\" people do. <br /> <br />2. That everyone spoke, well, mostly sweared, in Chinese.  The merging of Eatern and Western cultures made this fictional future/universe as intriguing as \\"Blade Runner\\". <br /> <br />3. The well-written, witty, and perfectly timed-dialog, perfectly executed by a top-notch cast of actors I'd never heard of, who obviously were enjoying the parts they were playing.  Damn refreshing to see genuine actors enjoying and appreciating their craft instead of a bunch of cause-addicted egomaniacs going through the motions for the sake of an inflated paycheck. <br /> <br />4. The ship, Serenity, had that cool Millenium-Falcon thing going for it.  Everything felt real on that ship, wires hanging out, cluttered bridge, grimy engine room and a cute mechanic with actual engine smudge on her.  And the ship just looked cool, especially in the opening and ending sequences. <br /> <br />5. The Parliament's \\"Operative\\", another refreshing character.  This guy was calm, calculating, and truly believed that he was working for the greater good and the end justified his means.  He definitely was NOT the greedy/power-hungry/dark-side-of-the-force cliche I'm so tired of seeing.  The \\"fall on your sword\\" scene in the teaser was just brilliant and really defined his character for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> <br />What I DIDN'T like about \\"Serenity\\": <br /> <br />1. The \\"Mr. Universe\\" character.  He was likeable enough, but just seemed like a plot-driven device in what was(to me) a character-driven film.  He was probably the one cliched character in the movie, basically filling the roll of the know-it-all computer-geek that gets the writers out of a jam. <br /> <br />2. The \\"Reavers\\" seemed a little 2-D to me, and made the ending a little too \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" for my sci fi tastes.  There was some serious logic holes regarding their existence too. <br /> <br />3. Not enough backstory on the preacher(?) and the gorgeous love interest of Captain Mal.  I watched the deleted scenes and think some of the scenes with her should have been left in.  Not just for her incredibly hot looks, but to better define her relationship with the captain.  The studio release of the film made her character look like a \\"generic love-interest for the sake of having a love interest\\" type character.  The preacher just seemed like a generic \\"I am the older and wiser one that everyone respects for no apparent reason\\" character.  I hope there is a director's cut released someday that will do these characters a little justice. <br /> <br />Overall though, I really liked the movie and I'm going to buy it because it definitely has replay value, may even look at the tv series that spawned the film.   <br /> <br />I think I seewhy some folks rave about the movie, it was very entertaining and yes, Ill say it again, REFRESHING.  It wasn't Matrix-good, but certainly beat the snot out of the crap like \\"War of the Worlds\\" that 2005 had to offer.   <br /> <br />As for the venemous 1 and 2-star reviewers, well I'm not sure what to think of these people.  The best they can offer is generic, uninspired \\"it was boring\\" type comments and an almost anti-fanboy like zeal to trash what was a very good movie.  (I suspect these folks LOVED \\"War of the Worlds\\")  Perhaps someone needs to slip a ridilin mickey in their Mr. Pibb when the next decent movie comes out. <br /> <br />Anyway, rent and/or buy \\"Serenity\\",  It's a good movie and I look forward to seeing a sequel. <br /> <br />End of long-winded review. <br />
B000301YY8|4.0|I love this cd, it's perfect for any kind of mood you're in!
0060736267|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but I understand why many would not.  This is a historical novel and one where if you don't understand the language and descriptions used, you will not get much out of it.  Also, this book requires a lot of reading in between the lines and critical thinking.  This is why \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is so often required reading material and also why most adolescents don't like or understand it.  This novel is about a girl living in poverty in the early 1900s.  Simply put, this is about her life and the observations she makes about why people behave the way they do.   There are many historical aspects to the story.  There are references made to the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, and frankly, if you don't know much about the history of the country during this time, you will miss even more still.  If you do not have at least some background and interest in reading 'classic literature' and even history, this probably isn't the book for you.    But if you do enjoy reading good literature, then this is definately the book for you.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and got a lot out of it.  The characters are interesting, and it's an interesting look into human behavior which, despite the times of the novel, still hold true today.

0393312836|5.0|Throughout much of my pre-teen years I had heard much about this story through people who hated Kubrick's film version, naturally this peaked my interest and I really wanted to see it.  This would not happen for a number of years though, as I wanted to respect those I lived with.  So I went out and got my hands on the book by Anthony Burgess, and read it cover to cover in one sitting.  This novella is a highly intelligent, complex and energized futuristic adventure about a brutal fifteen year old boy, Alex, who whirls through the night with his three teenage \\"droogies\\" performing \\"a bit of the old ultraviolence\\" on all the helpless \\"weepy young devotchkas\\".  The language shared by these anti-heroes, called \\"nadsat\\" a mix of British and Russian slang, is ingenious and perfectly illustrates  these hoodlums social pathology. <br /> <br />Alex and his droogs have the time of their lives destroying other people.  Each night they begin their reign of terror in the same way, they assemble at the Korova Milkbar for \\"milk with knives in it\\", which is milk laced with \\"drencrom\\" or \\"synthemesc\\" which would \\"sharpen you up and get you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence.\\"  Upon \\"sharpening their knives\\" they proceed through the streets of a post-apocolyptic & fascist London, where they knife the innocent and rape and carve through the beautiful - howling for joy all the while.  A third of the way through the book, our hero, Alex, is apprehended by the \\"milicents\\" after being betrayed by his droogs and is sentenced to fourteen years in jail.  Here Alex is placed in a state-run program designed to rehabilitate violent criminals through an inhuman conditioning technique.  Transforming Alex into a model citizen, we see how Alex was conditioned to respond to violence, sex and even his favorite music - Beethoven with a violent and surging sickness.  Though Alex is now incapable of violent acts, and so is forced to remain helpless as one by one, his victims perform savage revengeupon Alex's person.  We now see Alex as the victim, crouching over in sickness from the violent thoughts flooding his mind, but incapable of acting upon them.  Upon receiving negative press due to inhuman treatment our protagonist is subjected to, the State turns Alex back into his happy brutal self, freeing him to \\"carve through the litso of the whole creeching world with his cut-throat britva.\\"  This book is a social and moral commentary on society and the nature of good and evil, and the choices between them.   <br /> <br />The one downside to this edition, is the inclusion of the twenty-first chapter.  This chapter should in no way be seen as a part of this story, it is more like a mini sequel, and it does no justice to the story and its subtext.  This chapter was not in the original first edition, and only appeared after the film version, and in a way, it was included solely for the purpose of cushioning the devastating effects that this film apparently had on many viewers.  I feel that this last-minute inclusion of this chapter was a sort of disowning act for Burgess, who never liked his own story, and felt it needed this sort of an ending to redeem the whole thing - which goes against everything he claimed the book represented.  Read it if you like happy endings, but ignore it at all costs if you intend to preserve this book's integrity.  Just my opinion.
B0000019PA|4.0|I always thought I know my indie music but I had never heard of Neutral Milk Hotel who are apparently around since more than a decade. <br />I must say I am pleasantly surprised. Amazon recommended me this album because I listened to Palace and Built to Spill and others. <br /> <br />Songs like King of Carrot Flowers remind me a little of a band like the Decemberists but also Bright Eyes in the way songs are structured and how the songs are sung. <br /> <br />They sometimes sound as a crickety punkband with laziness, coming close but not reaching the genious of Pavement.  <br /> <br />\\"In The Aaroplane over the Sea\\" is the perfect Will Oldham meets Bright Eyes track. Very simple strumming, but simple tunes often are the best.  <br /> <br />This album shares a theme, it's loosely based on World War II. Albums that came out around 2005 also had themes, Bright Eyes about New York and the Decemberists about the Pirates. Makes you think this album is from that same year but it's from almost a decade earlier, making it more astonishing.  <br /> <br />It's very rich in it's instrumentation. Rickety punk, acoustic folk and even sad horn arrangements (The Fool) that could be in a Godfather movie. Untitled has strange synth sounds and something resembling bagpipes (untitled). <br /> <br />Overall, too bad I discovered this 8 years too late but I am glad I did now, it's really good. If you like all the bands I mentioned here you're sure to like this one.
B000002JK2|5.0|Pete Townshend solo albums can be pretentious affairs.  Not that that is such a bad thing, as Townshend had the talents to back up his pretentions in most cases, but it did not always ensure enjoyable listening.  Here he teams with fellow ex-mod Ronnie Lane, late of the Faces for a rather down to earth affair, that I think is one of the best albums he had ever been involved with.<br /><br />At the time Townshend had been painted into a corner with the Who by both his \\"Hope I die beforeI get Old\\" line as well finding a new direction for his aging full time band, The Who.  ROUGH MIX low key approach allows him to blow off some steam without being held to making the big statements expected from the Who a the time.  Ronnie Lane contributes a folksy side that is the perfect balance to Townshend's arty approach.  Lane's NOWHERE TO RUN, ANNIE and APRIL FOOL are beautiful highlights featuring relaxed aucoustic settings.  He duets with Townshend effectively on the closing country standard TILL THE RIVERS ALL RUN DRY.<br /><br />All this is not to take away from Townshend's efforts.  MISSUNDERSTOOD and STREET IN THE CITY are successful visits to his more esoteric range, while KEEP ME TURNING and HEART TO HANG ON TO ARE full blooded rockers closer to his Who nmaterial.  MY BABY GIVES IT AWAY and ROUGH MIX are down and dirty rockers that are looser than his usual fare.<br /><br />ROUGH MIX is a great 70's relic that stands the tests of time and provides a solid look at the fun side of Pete Townshend that he tends to keep hidden.

B00027JZ3E|5.0|I received my movie quickly and it was in excellent condition as promised. I highly reccomend this seller.
B00005JOE8|5.0|This movie makes you think, which is more than I can say about just about every movie that comes out of Hollywood these days.  It follows a stong set of characters who pack a punch into the political tyranny of a futuristic England which is controlled by a leader which presents many characteristics of a futuristic Adolf Hitler.  Now, I have read a review which says something about this movie being anti-bush.  I really dont see how that is.  There is a tie into todays politics, and media more importantly.  The ease to control the masses using fear is a situation we all face everyday.  Being a Canadian citizen, I am less subjected to this fear, but for Americans there is a constant battery of bullcrap news reports about terrorism that never happens.  This is because the government wants you to be afraid so that when they decide that they want to take over Iraq you will support them to do anything to rid yourself of the fear they inpose upon you.  This IS the major point of this film which anyone who found it un-moving or boring obviously failed to recognize.  The future England can be a reality of sorts if this is allowed to go on.  People should not be forced into fearing the world.  Sure terroism is very frightning, but media propoganda is beating people when they are already down.  This has always been a problem, but never as bad as it has been since 9-11.  I appreciate the attempts of the filmmakers behind this project and everyone who understands what Im saying will have loved this movie......
B000301YY8|1.0|This could have been a beautiful first release for a new artist but he ruins it by swearing in every song!
B000E5N62U|5.0|Honestly, I didn't know what to expect this time around, but one had to assume that this collection would be more interesting than \\"Kamakiriad\\". I think all true Steely Dan fans were hoping for \\"The Nightfly\\", the sequel. Instead, what we got is another Steely Dan CD. No, that's not a bad thing. In fact, I'll go as far as to say this could be considered a continuation of \\"Everything Must Go\\", both lyrically and musically. It would not surprise me one bit if someone told me that some of these songs were actually written for the aforementioned disc. That said, this little storybook is a fun, albeit occasionally dark listen from start to finish. Not to worry, even Donald's darker tunes are often bouncy & catchy. He & Walter Becker are but a few who can pull off that feat. (Remember \\"Gaslighting Abby\\"?) There's not a weak track to be found on this slick production. Donald Fagen's lyrics are as biting and cynical as ever. Musically, it's what you've come to expect. Toe tapping tempos, interesting melodies over the occasional unexpected chord progression. That's what makes Donald, well ... Donald. This is one of those albums that you just don't want to end. The title track sets the tone for much of the next 52 minutes & change, but for my money the standout tracks come much later in \\"Security Joan\\" and \\"The Night Belongs to Mona\\".  Dim the lights, pour yourself a cocktail and pop this baby on the tray. It will take you to 40 floors above New York City.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Once again the bad McCartney touch is evident.  No, not the good McCartney touch, the one with his incredible song-writing and vocal and musical talent.  The grudge against John Lennon.  In this documentary, virtually every time there is footage of the beatles concerts, the film is edited to show McCartney speaking for the group, giving the illusion that McCartney was the leader of the group.  Everyone knows that in the early days, John Lennon led the group.  And all the footage of their performances, while they were still touring, was when the group was still in it's early days.  Yet, we see the film cut to show the parts where McCartney is speaking for the group and there is very little footage showing John Lennon speaking for the group, as he did much of the time when they were performing live in the touring days. <br /> <br />It's such a shame that a man with so much talent, so much raw musical instinct and sheer performing genius can still be so upset by being usurped by John Lennon.  Get over it Paul, the man is no longer around.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|When you examine the cd booklet you see Mad Donna in a variety of poses that suggest something animalistic, like a baboon presenting it's enflamed hindquarters as a signal to mate. In Madonna's case I believe it's a case of a woman who is clearly aware that the \\"train is leaving the station\\" if you know what I mean. God only knows how much longer she can pull it off. I am rooting - like a pig - for her to keep it going for as long as digital technology allows (visually and in the recording studio). As far as the music goes...it's a standard in the music industry (with popular music anyway) to start one's album off with a bang. Unfortunately she unwisely cribs from ABBA in hopes of doing just that. It just doesn't work as a single, even though it - like the entire album - is well-produced and engineered. When she's not taking from ABBA, she goes for Giorgio Moroder style flourishes. Occasionally it works. The one song that is absolute garbage is \\"I Love NY\\" - just awful. It's almost a shame that her name is attached to this. I might like this album more were it put out by a rising ingenue / diva. Since it's \\"Madonna\\" she has too much baggage including failed attempts at film acting and a spoiled rotten attitude, and at HER age. My suggestion is for her to beg William Orbit to work with her again, who produced some of her best work.
B000063COX|5.0|Oh man! Does Maiden ever displease? With this debut album, the answer to that question is a big, fat NO! I got this puppy (remastered edition) and was blown away the minute I popped her in. I was literally foaming at the mouth is was so good. The riffs, the drums, the fickin' bass, and Paul's terrific voice just put me into convulsions. I listened to it 4 times in a row, and had to stop for my health's sake. Yeah its that good. All 9 songs are great, and special in their own way. Its impossible to lump any 2 of them together. They all have different, special qualities about them. The one and only con in fact (though it isnt that big) is that the bass drum is unhearable if played at all. Now, I'm a drummer so I'm affected by that, but like I said no biggy!<br /><br />Prowler: Ahh! This is Maiden at their dirtiest, raunchiest, and lowest best! Ya cant get much dirtier that this masterpeice! The riffs, the harmony guitar, and the vocals are really good! Just really good! Love it baby. 9/10<br /><br />Santuary: A maiden classic, and after u listen to the beginning riff i think you'll know why. This live-friendly hit is a work of art, with its lyrics, bass, and sweet drums. A great maiden. 10/10<br /><br />Remember Tomarrow: Crap, this song is good. The guitars start off quite melodic and soothing, with Paul easily singing the lyrics, but dont turn away, because all of a sudden Paul screams at the guitars harmonically gallop to a sweet \\"chorus\\". The solos and interludes are very mezmerizing as well! Check out the Live at the Rainbow track of this song; its quite faster, than it already is! 10/10<br /><br />Running Free: One of my top 10 maiden songs, then again 20+ maiden songs are in my top ten so humph. Anyway, this great little bit is probably just what a teen is looking for so listen to it, love the opening drums and bass lovin', and run free! 10/10<br /><br />Phantom of the Opera: Yeah, i dont need to talk about this song. Only that its one of my top ten, the opening guitars are insane, the solos/interludes are to die for, and the vocals are Paul at his best. It kinda sucks. Ha, good one! 10/10<br /><br />Translyvania: My favorite maiden instrumental, and one of my favorite instrumentals of all time! The opening guitars and the really fast guitars for the \\"chorus\\" are just mind blowing. Just a great song! The drums by the way are some of Burr's most complex works. 10/10<br /><br />Strange World: This slower, more mellow song is much better than that prodical son of Killers, and has much more meaning. Not my favorite on the cd, but still a good song. I dont hate it of coarse, but its not remember tomarrow either. 8.5/10<br /><br />Charlotte the harlot: Another one of those dirties! Ahh, this is a dame. Great bass at the beginning, which moves into Murray's sweet riffs. The vocals are wild, and the interlude is awesome. 10/10<br /><br />Iron maiden: The title track, one of my top ten, and a gem. This killer song is just what the doctor ordered and its got blood to spare. The opening guitars are crazy, the solo is awesome, and the lyrics are sweet. I love the bask up vocals by steve/dennis and love the ending. A great live song also! 10/10<br /><br />Great album, great band, great music, great price. Go and buy it you SOB you. p.s. one of the best debut albums, in my opinion, by any band that I like, probably next to Van Halen and Led Zeppelin.the opening guitars are insane, the solos/interludes are to die for, and the vocals are Paul at his best.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|If the AMPAS voters were too conservative to give the movie an Oscar as the popular version goes, they sure shunned some other veteran contenders and awarded the Oscar to the music.  <br /> <br />The compositions tell the Brokeback story, adding their own lament to its beauty.

B00005JLR2|5.0|*** Spoiler Warning - this review might reveal surprises in the movie *** <br /> <br />First off for a frame of reference, I'm a 30-year old male and a sucker for Disney movies in general. <br /> <br />When this movie came and went to the theatres in a flash, I heard so much bad about it, how it was the worst Disney movie ever, that I actually didn't go see it in the theatre. I regret that now. First time I actually saw this movie was on a 14-hour flight from Los Angeles to London, and I fell heads over heels in love with it! <br /> <br />I adored the original Novel \\"Treasure Island\\", and I believe that Treasure Planet lives up to it. The central theme of Treasure Planet, in my mind, is the boy, Jim, who grows up with only a vague recollection of his father who in the movie appears like a shadow in Jim's faded childhood memories. <br /> <br />I think this particular \\"flashback\\" scene was very powerful, it featured the absolutely brilliant \\"I'm still here\\" track by Johnny Rzesnik, and led the viewer to fully understand Jim's childhood, and to share his teenage frustration and delinquency that stems from his father abandoning the young Jim and his mother. Possibly, I might a bit biased in this respect, since I can strongly identify with this situation as my own father was \\"married to the sea\\" when I grew up, and i can admit that i blubbered like a baby during the flashback sequence. <br /> <br />This is right in line with the core message of the film. A young, reckless and frustrated boy who is taken under the wing of the Old Salt, who becomes his new father figure. He learns how to take orders, work hard, grow, face adversity, and eventually become a man by making tough choices. An excellent message in this day and age, if you ask me. <br /> <br />I also loved the theme the producers chose. A type of anachronistic retro-futuristic design, where we in the future still use old, creaking, wooden, pirate ships, but with ultra futuristic systems. The movie also suspends the viewer from reality in many flavorful ways - for instance when the spaceship travels through the universe, it encounters a pod of whales. Or how Jim takes a dhingy \\"comet surfing\\". <br /> <br />I think this film provides excellent entertainment, suspense and has a great message for kids. But as an adult, I think I also got a kick out of this GREAT and CLEARLY UNDERRATED Disney flick. <br /> <br />SEE IT!
0380789035|5.0|A dark, rich and delightful book that explores a view of Godhood and its relationship to a melting pot culture without roots.
0440180295|5.0|I'm not a very avid reader, but what I can say about this book is that it made me realize that there is some literature out there that I can really appreciate. I was recommended this book by a friend about 4 years ago in college who had similar tastes as I do. Since then I've read it three times among many, many more books than I had read before that.  <br /> <br />The story is unconventional with its mostly unironic WWII/science fiction theme and nonlinear story telling. Its like Vonnegut is saying this time were doing it my way, were doing it Billy Pilgrims way, and this is the story of his life.  <br /> <br />The use of blunt, sometimes vulgar language is one of Vonnegut's characteristic tools that he uses to get at a truth that can only be reached through this type of storytelling. The opening line: \\"Listen, Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time\\" says it all. The tone for the entire book and a mini-summary of it is all in that one sentence.  <br /> <br />This to-the-point style is I think what makes it such and easy and popular read, although it is in no way unskilled. With that I'll just say that I think more people need to read this book. Other five star ratings dont even come close to what this one means.
B00004Y6O9|3.0|This album is a fun reminder of high school that doesn't hold up to the test of time. Van Halen emerged during a lull in the high water mark of hard rock. Aerosmith was self-destructing, Ted Nugent had become self-parody, and countless other rocking bands were too busy snorting, shooting, or chugging to make much difference. Enter the ego-maniacal Edward Van Halen, erroneously credited with inventing a technique he merely popularized to the point that every idiot with a guitar and a can of hair spray thought they knew how to play. Teamed up with the utterly pathetic self-promoting Plant-wannabe with the clever monikor of David Lee Roth, and you had the one-two punch of Van Halen.<br /><br />The song writing is okay but nothing stellar emerges. The best songs are bombastic glory (\\"Runnin' With The Devil\\") and covers (the Kinks) and, more interestingly, give little indication of their predilection for corporate rock, ala Journey, by the time Roth was punching out and Mr. Annoying Sammy Hagar was replacing him.<br /><br />Yeah, Edward is an unbelievably fleet fingered guitarist who has come up with truly unique guitar work. So what? So have countless guitarists who garner half the glory and who handle their fame with much less arrogance than the ex-Mr. Bertinelli.<br /><br />As fame went to their heads, the band increasingly held their fans in contempt, releasing albums that clocked in slightly over a half hour and were chock full of written-on-the-fly garbage that shows all the concern of a band of egotists and self-annointed superstars. Somebody get me a doctor, indeed.
B000002KHB|5.0|No need to say more.  If you grew up in the 70's then you already know about this stellar band and this excellent release.<br /><br />This music is brilliant.  Impossible not to like.<br /><br />Overplayed?  Oh yeah.  But it still sounds great on cd.<br /><br />Buy it to crank up on those Friday afternoons when you're sitting in your car in heavy traffic.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This mini series is for anyone who is a sci fi fan with a Brain and a heart. The Character developement and writing is the best I have seen since the glory days of Star Trek 2nd Generation . Its a mistake that the network idiots dropped this show .

B0001GMIOE|5.0|I had originally order'd the wrong battery. Getting an exchange for the correct one was no hassell.
B000002G7E|1.0|I mean honestly, this album sucks.  I know its supposedly the prototype for punk, but c'mon there are much better examples of proto punk, i.e. The Stooges.  There is just too much heroin on this record.  \\"Sister Ray\\" is a noisy mess.  The only worthwhile track is the title track.  The rest of the album is just an all out attack on quality music.  Don't get me wrong, I love rawness and imperfection in my rock music, but this is just crap.  There are better representations of what the Velvet Underground were capable of and how influential they were for punk and indie music.  Pick up the slightly overrated \\"Velvet Underground and Nico\\" and also the very underrated \\"Velvet Underground.\\"  But skip this one all together.  You'll be better for it.  nuff said
B00005JLEU|5.0|I enjoyed very much this beautiful film, and i'd like to purchase the dvd, but please include a track in spanish, and spanish subtitles.
B000002UA0|2.0|At the risk of being on the outs with my fellow Floyd fans I'm going have to say that is album is subpar.  I know Sid Barret is a talented artist and has all the allure of the tragic rock star but the music presented here is just not all that great.  I don't know, maybe its just because I really don't have much tolerance for quirky pyschedelia, but I just find this album to be trite and unexciting.  I honestly would give this album only one star if it wasn't for the two instrumental pieces, \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive.\\"  These tunes are the only ones that seem to hint at what the Floyd was truly capable of, spacey soundscapes and jazz like interplay. <br />As for the rest of the album it is severly dated.  The songs are cheesy and silly much like the low points on classic Beatles or Cream albums. i.e. \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" from Abbey Road or \\"Blue Condition\\" from Disarelli Gears.  All in all if you're a fan you should buy, but only to complete your collection.  nuff said.
B000002UB3|5.0|During the creation of the album \\"Let it Be,\\" tensions among the Beatles were high. Arguements were very common among them by now. Their creative differences were slowly breaking the group apart. Although \\"Let it Be\\" turned out to be a musical masterpiece, the Beatles just could not leave on a sad note. <br /> <br />That was when they went back into the studio to record their final album, \\"Abbey Road.\\" Although they didn't start recording \\"Abbey Road\\" knowing that it would be their last album, there was a certain feeling among them that this might be the one. Unfortunately, it was, and the greatest rock and roll band of all time broke up. However, they did not go out on a sad note. Abbey Road is one of the greatest albums ever recorded. It has stood the test of time and is still a great selling CD and is a classic. During its production, there were very little arguments or disagreements among the Beatles and they all seemed happy. It is just sad that it had to end. <br /> <br />As with their other albums, all of the Beatles greatly contributed to \\"Abbey Road.\\" John's \\"Come Together\\" is a great addition to the album. Paul's \\"Golden Slumbers\\" is the perfect song to precede the message bearing \\"The End.\\" We also see George's writing and singing style really blossom with \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun.\\" We also see that Ringo still has his playful side with \\"Octopus's Garden.\\" Other standouts are Paul's emotional \\"Oh! Darling,\\" and John's hard rocker \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy).\\" \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" is also another great standout. Every song on this album, really, is a standout. The entire album was well sung, written, and produced. <br /> <br />If you like music at all, then you should definitely pick up this album. Anyone who appreciates good music will greatly appreciate this. After all, this is from the best of the best: The Beatles.
B00009TB5G|4.0|The animated creatures special effects work is very well done in CGI. Still,  I lament that all is made with computor images, and not through stop motion  technique using real models. A computor image can be very realistically  made, but still lacks a certain something, a sense of real  manifested mass and presence. One of the last great stop motion creatures  used on screen was the dragon in the movie Dragonslayer; is was very  advanced and had a computorized mechanism called Go Motion to give it  carefully adjusted movements. Here the computor had, as it should, a  supporting role, instead of totally taking over. It is a pity that this  branch of effects work was abandoned for the less costly CGI. Because the  use of a model gives by itself a sense of presence on the screen, that can't  fully be achieved with the illusion of the computor image. A real model  brings an actuality of sharpness to movements, forms, colors, lights and  shadows. The continuation of the Go Motion technique would have been an  investment for the future, and led to many interesting discoveries  in anatomical and engineering mechanics, developed the knowledge of hard   and elastic complex materials, and would have been a major factor in the  advancement of robotics. Instead the film industry exclusively chose, for  financial reasons, the less costly road of doing make-believe illusions  within the computor.
1401207138|5.0|Wow this was worth every penny.  Even though I already own a TPB of Watchmen this just sounded too good to pass up, and boy was I right.  The larger pages only help the art, the new color seperations make it look even better, but not so glossy as to distract, and all the extras are so in depth.  I especially loved reading Alan Moore's sampled script pages.  The only thing this is lacking is some current input from the creators, but that can't be helped, due to some decades old arguements not worth getting into here.  So barring that one complaint, I would say absolute if definitly how I would describe it.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice was not my favorite, but Rosamund Pike was the best Jane Bennet. In my opinion the best adaptation of P&P is so far the 1995 BBC version with Colin Firth and Jenifer Ehle, however the most accurate to the book is the 1980 version with David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie.<br />Perhaps the thing that I disliked the most about this movie was the fact that they made Mr. Bingley look so goofy, almost like an idiot, and Mr. Darcy was to shy. He did not had the dominant masculine strength that I found so appealing in P&P. I watch just about every adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and it took me a while to warm up to the 2005 version, but after several times watching the movie I learn to enjoy it. I think this adaptation appeals more to the younger generation. Even thought the characters were not very accurate to the book, they all had a charm of their own. My favorite character was Rosamund Pike, she was by far the best Jane Bennet.<br />This was a more modern adaptation of P&P, where the strict rules of the time were not follow as they have should. The fashion was a little bit to sloppy for me, it did not had the clean and tidy look as I would want to see. Usually when I see a modern adaptation of an period novel, I prefer to see it \\"separated\\" from the novel, even when it has the same story line and the same characters. I like to see it with it's own independence, like: \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" or \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" or a more funny adaptation, like \\"Lost in Austen\\", but when they put that modern feel to the \\"period\\" it makes me feel like they have butchered the book.<br />With all this said, I still enjoyed the movie (eventually), and I'm sure the 2005 version with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen inspire the love, and curiosity for Jane Austen novels to many of the younger generation, who perhaps before were looking at Jane Austen as nothing more than just another high school boring assignment.
B000025H0Q|4.0|Honestly, hasn't anyone ever heard of trying something different?  Would you really want him to do the same thing over again?  Or would you rather he explore other areas of music?  In my opinion, that is what a good musician does.  He/she tries to do something different than the previous album.   <br /> <br />I think what people find disappointing about this ablum is that it isn't the Nick Drake they fell in love with.  He's branched out a bit more, and that doesn't sit well with some people.  I'm really impressed with the melodies in this collection and I think it's really beautiful.  So there!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can not believe I didn't hear about this show when it was on the air. What a loss! This was a rare show that was unique, had good charater development, and a great storyline. The show is a mixture between western and sci fi. Man! I can't believe they cancelled this show. I thought the show was better than the movie. I would recommend to watch the show first and then the movie.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|this is a horrible record for fans who waited more than 10 years for original material.  <br />I learned to play guitar with pink floyd and the 2 other solo albums by gilmour. but this is a complete joke. recycled solos, stupid lyrics... i could go on. i don't know what happened. while some guitarists keep their grace with age, like mark knopfler, gilmour and a few others indulge in these beautiful tunes that just make one sleepy. probably the worst floyd- related release ever.  <br />in the first few days, the reviews here at amazon were terrible. now, it's getting a little better. don't tell me that this \\"grows on you\\"...  <br />terrible record. <br />
0307276902|3.0|I'll admit that I chose to review this book out of sheer curiosity, due to all the publicity it's received in the last few months. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it doesn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />A Million Little Pieces is Frey's self-told story of addiction and recovery. It begins shortly before his admission to a private rehab clinic, and continues with his time spent in recovery. Throughout his time there, Frey frequently flashes back to points in his life during his addiction. These descriptions of an addict's life are by far the most interesting parts of the book.<br /><br />I found A Million Little Pieces very difficult to enjoy, mostly due to Frey's extremely disjointed style of writing. His lack of quotation marks and tendency to only write a word or two per line is quite distracting, as is his habit of continuously repeating a word or phrase over and over.<br /><br />Disregarding Frey's writing style, I think that this book would have been more enjoyable had I read it without knowing the history of deceit surrounding it. Knowing that key parts of the book were embellished or made up altogether made it difficult to \\"get into\\" Frey's situation. On the same note, had the book been advertised as a fiction novel and not as a true story, it would have likewise been more enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, I would have to say that I didn't really enjoy this book. Less than halfway through, I had to force myself to continue reading, and had I just picked up this book on my own, I probably wouldn't have bothered finishing it.

B000002LGA|4.0|Add Lou Reed to my list of rock stars it took me far too long to get into (it started with Neil Young). In fact, my Lou Reed Saga began this past Sunday, when I heard Walk on the Wildside on the radio (I rarely listen to the radio, mind you) and loved it, even downloading it. Then I went through my family's Big Book of CD's, because I thought I had saw a Lou Reed disc in there.<br /><br />Sure enough, I came up with New York, one of the best concept albums of all time. But be warned, it's not for everybody, just like the music of Lou Reed's Velvet Underground wasn't exactly for everybody. But there are some great moments, starting with Romeo Had Juliette, a nice vintegette of two lovers in the ghettos of New York. This ghetto theme continues with Dirty Blvd., one of the most angry protests ever recorded. because of the contrast between the music and the lyrics, partially becuase of hte lyrics themselves. In spite of the rage (a poor immigrant's son dreams of killing his abusive father, for instance), it actually is funny in its own, offbeat, Lou Reed-style way. The part about the Statue of Bigotry is grim, yet oddly hilarious. Same with bits of winners Last Great American Whale and The Beginning of a Great Adventure. And there are several other high-quality songs, listen to Dime Store Mystery, Strawman and Christmas in February.<br /><br />Though it's an acquired taste, it's definitly worth it. And I would HIGHLY reccomend you check out the song Walk on the Wild Side, too.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I am beyond surprised by how much fun this cd is! Even the few songs about religion are positive, funky and fun! I think it's very clever how Prince has found new ways to write lyrics that are sexy and sultry without being perverse.     To Joshua Hubeny, the \\"long-time Prince fan\\" that said Prince hated electronic music...perhaps you should spin some of those classic albums a few more times and listen to the songs \\"Dirty Mind\\", \\"Annie Christian\\", \\"AUTOmatic\\", \\"Computer Blue\\", \\"U Got the Look\\", \\"Shockadelica\\", \\"The Future\\", \\"Live 4 Love\\", \\"I Wanna Melt with U\\", \\"LOOSE\\", \\"New World\\" & \\"Strange but True\\". Prince built his career by pioneering the use of synths and drum machines in R&B. He may have thrown out the drum machines for a while in the 90's but the synths have always been there. (The acoustic guitar driven album \\"The Truth\\" even had synth on a few songs). If you want to live in the past and automatically hate everything new, that's fine but to say that Prince \\"is not one for synthesizers\\" in completely idiotic.
B000AXSN5G|1.0|Neil Young. <br />That's all I have to say. <br />There has been no bigger influence in my life as far as music goes.  And other things. <br />Please.  Let the man die in peace.   <br />This album is soooooo bad. <br />Really? <br />I can't believe people love this.  It's almost as bad as Are You Passionate? <br />Folks? <br />Are you babyboomers or what? <br />When will you go away.   <br />And that new movie... <br />Peforming songs from this album.   <br />you'd have to pay me $100.  Then I would go.  Maybe. <br />Neil is back? <br />Yeah, so are the Rolling Stones. <br />Please stop. <br />Let him die with some dignitey.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is the best BBC period piece I have seen to date, and yes I would even rank it above Pride and Prejudice.  Beautifully shot, impeccably acted- this film is a credit to the screenwriter.  Since purchasing this film, every one of my friends who has seen it has bought the dvd for themselves.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I could watch this one once a month, great stars, good story line, and lots of Singing and dancing.
B0000029GA|5.0|I didn't like this album at all the first time I heard it, however after listening every song a couple of times I LOVED it! <br /> <br />There is no bad song in this album, almost every song is a instant CLASSIC! <br /> <br />Nas spits great lyrics. Maybe the best you have ever heard. However the beats are not very good, but the lyrics are so good that I still gave this album 5 stars. <br /> <br />Lyricwise: 20/10!!! <br />Beats: 7/10 <br /> <br />Best song: Represent
B000002OZY|5.0|I hadn't listened to Tommy for years.  My loss as I forgot just how good this album is!  Captain Walker, the Acid Queen, Uncle Ernie, Sally Simpson, they are all still here and greater than ever!  As well as one of the greatest song segments of all time  <br />(listening to you, I get excitement at your feet, etc.).  Do yourself a favor and re-experience Tommy, it is well worth it!
0812550757|3.0|Orson Scott Card's first novel in this series, 'Ender's Game,' was one of my favorite books.  Unfortunately, 'Speaker for the Dead,' the second sequel to 'Ender's Game,' does not live up to the excitement and imagination of its predecessor.  'Speaker for the Dead' is still an okay book, but nowhere near up to Mr. Card's potential. <br /> <br />If you haven't read 'Ender's Game' yet, you should, but don't bother reading this book (at least not yet).  If you have already read 'Ender's Game,' and you really liked the characters, then you might also enjoy 'Speaker for the Dead,' but be prepared to be disappointed.
B000E97HIA|5.0|\\"3121\\" is the album I have been wanting out of Prince for more than a decade now.  \\"Musicology\\" was a step in the right direction, but this album is solid, fresh, exciting, and just an all out fantastic album.  It is very rare these days, that I can listen to an album that has no filler.  McCartney's \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" was one of thost albums and I am now very pleased to say that \\"3121\\" is as well.  Prince's old school funk dominates a lot of this album with tracks like \\"Black Sweat\\", \\"Lolita\\", and \\"Get On The Boat\\".  The ballads, especially \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" are equally as stunning.  Even Prince's best albums such as \\"Sign O' The Times\\" and \\"Purple Rain\\" had filler, yet \\"3121\\" is a solid and flawless R&B masterpiece that deserves attention from all music fans.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Unhappily this CD doesn't have the same great quailties as the first, \\"Michael Bubl\\" .  <br />He's going out of his zone and trying to emulate the same \\"pop\\" sound that has infected so many of the real singers, so that their music is no longer musical , just noise.  <br />Too bad these singers and their managers don't \\"get It\\". People are still listening to Sinatra, Clooney, etc. because they sang songs that had rhythm and flow, and a melody that you could sing along with .The sounds didn't want to make you cover your ears, and the words told a story or made a statement. Are the rappers or the ohhhhhhhhh moaners going to ever be classified as great singers?  <br />Sing it straight Michael, or I'll not buy another of your CDs!
B000BB14YY|5.0|I know that a lot of folks don't necessarily give Kurosawa's later works their proper due.  Choosing to focus on his earlier masterworks like Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Yojimbo, Throne of Blood, The Bad Sleep Well, Stray Dog, etc, which are indeed astounding films.  However, Ran should not be overlooked in the slightest.  Without going into the nitty gritty of the piece it is basically a transposition of King Lear into a period of feudel Japanese history with the notable difference being the presence of three sons rather than daughters.  It is a film of epic scope and contains within a final five minutes that could most likely bring tears to the eye.  Aesthetically, this film is unmatched.  It is gorgeous, colorful and vibrant and yet incredibly dark and cynical.  Humanity does not get any gold stars in this one and justifiably so.  Criterion films are very expensive but as is the case for most of them this one is worth every single penny.  The image and sound are both pristine.  The audio commentary is insightful and Chris Marker's documentary tone poem on disc 2 is worth the cost in and of itself.  As a package it is absolutely stunning.  To say much more would be superfluous as the film is epic, yet intimate, emotionally driven, yet possessed of one the most heart stopping battle sequences I have seen committed to film.  For once you feel the tragedy.  If you are a fan of Kurosawa but haven't explored his later works then do yourself a favor and pick this one up.  IF you are brand new to his work I might start elsewhere with something a little less stylized like Ikiru or Seven Samurai but keep this one high on the list because it is without a doubt another one of his masterworks.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw this on T.V. But I finally picked it up on a recommendation.  It is an awesome series and I am sad that there will be no more episodes.  I highly recommend this series. If you like Joss Whedon's work then you will love this.
0765315246|5.0|Being a budding Sci-Fi writer, I also tend to read. A lot. Just bought a copy of John Scalzi \\"Old Man's War\\". Fantastic page turner. Cracked it open at 9:30pm, had it read by 4am. <br /> <br />It's an occupational hazard of working in IT. I generally go through 1000 pages or so of technical material a week. You get REALLY good a speed reading after a while. Either that or you go into management and hire people like me to do your reading for you. The job also plays well with my complete lack of a circadian rythem. Once my mind gets started on something, I'll go all night, all day, and eventually pass out from exhaustion. <br /> <br />Which is probably why I got married. Having to regularly deal with someone who is actually up in the morning and asleep at night (and coordinating my schedule accordingly) keeps me sane. Okay, not sane, but at least with one foot in the world of the living. <br /> <br />So back on task. I've been making a point to reading newly released science fiction to get an idea for what is being done in this day and age. Sci-Fi from the 50's is WAY different than Sci-Fi today. Our understanding of technology has improved, dramatically. The cultural biases in our everday lives have changed, dramatically.  <br /> <br />Not that the 50s were some kind of golden age. Civilization changes on a regular basis, and like it or not Sci Fi is pretty much a pop culture art form. In some cases, we use in everday life today stuff that a 60s writer would never imagine. (Take mobile phones and the Internet). On the other hand, you sometimes get Gems that are so timeless that we can look past the ... <br /> <br />... Sorry. Let's get back to this book review. <br /> <br />Old Man's War is an extremely well crafted novel. And this is coming from a writing geek. Scalzi's writing style is so gripping and enticing that it took until after my first reading of the book, and a cup of coffee the next morning, for me to do my \\"HEY Wait a minute!\\" about the plot holes, technological \\"don't go theres\\", and various and sundry other crimes against literature. <br /> <br />Keep in mind, I'm a sci-fi geek. I LOVE Asimov, Clarke, and Verne. But as much as I love them, I also know that every author's work is compromise between imagination, market pressures, and the craft of story telling. I have issues with EVERYBODY's stuff. Generally because I'm trying to get in the business of doing it better than they can. I also tend to find editing errors in movies, programming goofs in kiosks, and more or less can find a problem with almost everything up to and including apple pie, capitalism, and motherhood. <br /> <br />It's my job, I'm an Engineer. Granted a college dropout beatnick of one. <br /> <br />As much as I'm and engineer, I am also a fan. Consider it an aspect of Evil Twin Skippyism, you can love something and also acknowedge problems with it.  <br /> <br />I'm going to avoid discussing the problems with the story. They are theological, theoretical, and largely center around \\"If I were to have written the story...\\" As Scalzi says often in the book (when describing technologies) \\"You don't have the math.\\" <br /> <br />And you don't need the Math. Scalzi does a brilliant job of presenting characters, technologies and concepts, and then immediately dropping them into vivid action sequences. The story, while it does suffer from \\"Heinlein\\" syndrome, flows well. Exposition is in small bite sized packets. There is ample character development in the story. And the setting is fluid enough, and so well constructed, that you have immediate buy into the characters actions and motivations. <br /> <br />This is the stuff that makes literature literature, whether you are talking about westerns, political thrillers, or bio-engineered warriors locked in mortal combat with alien races. One can write a work that is completely thought out and self consistent, but (ok with the notable exception of Looking Backwards) if you don't have real characters the work is going to gather dust. <br /> <br />Scalzi's book takes place in a world where humanity finds itself coming of age in hostile galaxy. To meet threats to the Earth and its conquered territories, it has put together a massive defense force manned by Senior Citizens.  <br /> <br />???WTF!??? <br /> <br />Yes, the book is that well written that you buy that. No plot spoilers, but it works. Essentially you live out your life, and can decide to retire to a new life traveling to distant planets, encountering new life forms, and killing them. By means that become apparent in the story, you are given a new lease on life, get strapped to a pile of nifty sci-fi gear, and are blasting buggies faster that you can say \\"HOOOYAAA MASTER CHIEF\\". <br /> <br />Our main character develops a clique during boot camp, and we get to follow the lives (and glorious deaths) of many of these folks through the story. He even has backstories and personalities for the many \\"Red Shirts\\" that pass through the stories chapters. (Though frankly he does tend to make them so annoying that you don't really miss them when they die, on schedule, at the end of the episode.  <br /> <br />One not so spoiler: there is no \\"one\\" enemy. Scalzi does a thorough job of developing several alien races, friendly and not, for our characters to meet. <br /> <br />All in all if you love \\"Enders Game\\", you are going to love \\"Old Man's War.\\" Come for the action and the characters. The technology and setting are just there as a backdrop. <br /> <br />As well the should.
B000E97HIA|5.0|That will be the question at the 2007 Grammy awards for 3121 the latest by Prince. Like others have stated this is a winner of a cd no filler just pure funk and a welcome return to his roots. A must have for all music fans!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I am fairly sure from the comparisons I have made that the instruments were not changed but the albums sounds great, it sounds like a new album and ellufson sound clear. Whatever vocals were changed it still sounds great and Holy wars I am fairly sure was not changed. Don't worry about the people telling not to buy this recording...its not the Ozzy crap...instruments were not replaced.  <br /> <br />BUY IT!

B0007Y08IS|3.0|the movie was very enjoyable to watch. It would be good to watch  with gang of friends. It is definetly R rated. the bedroom scene is not one I would want to have to explain to a child. This is a good movie when a night of no thinking is due.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'm a fan of sci fi films, but I'd be the first to admit that the genre is deservedly under-represented on most \\"best films of the decade\\" lists. Does serenity belong on those lists? Not if you think great film is always high art. But Serenity does what too few Great Films get around to doing - it builds suspense, it makes you care about the characters, it leaves you drained and satisfied at the end - it entertains.<br /><br />The dialogue isn't great art. It's merely witty, brisk, and effective. The acting isn't brilliant, the actors simply enjoy what they're doing and imbue their characters with believable humanity in over-the-top unbelievable situations. The special effects are good, but they don't overshaddow the actors and they aren't the point of the film.<br /><br />The movie starts with a computer recreation of a brother's attempt to save his sister from some seriously bad government bad guys. From the start we know that these two siblings really care about each other. The computer recreation ends and we meet the film's chief bad guy. Within minutes we're convinced that this is one of those really scary villains, the kind who knows that what he does is bad but believes he's doing it for the very best cause. He's not a casual killer, but he can easily kill anyone, any number of anyones, for the sake of his cause. That sense of ultimate virtue drives him until the final minutes of the film.<br /><br />The film is space opera. The brave but damaged captain and his daring but badly flawed crew have taken in the siblings to flee with them across the galaxy as they try to get out of harm's way. Will they prevail in the end and strike a blow against the interstellar government? Of course they will. We know that from the beginning. It's a testament to the creative skill of the director and writer that we know that and are kept at the edges of our seats anyway. This is space opera as it should be, sci fi at its very best. It's a morality play with none of the philosophical, moral, or artistic pretentiousness that afflict most sci fi that tries to be art. It's a great way to spend a rainy afternoon and a fitting cap to the TV series it came from, Firefly.philosophical, moral, or artistic pretentiousness that afflict most sci fi that tries to be art.

B000E97HIA|1.0|[...] \\"3121\\" is dated, and the people who praise it are really praising Prince and NOT this actual record.  Prince hasn't done a great album in 16 years (\\"Graffiti Bridge\\").  \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\" was fluffy; \\"Come\\" was boring; the \\"symbol\\" album was tired, \\"the Gold Experience\\" sounded like RUST; \\"Musicology\\" was OVERRATED.  \\"3121\\" bored me to tears and it's true that he will NEVER do anything as great as \\"1999\\" or \\"Sign O the Times.\\"  Face it, the Short One's days are done!
B000058983|5.0|I'm not going to waste time and space gushing on and on about how great Forever Changes is; everyone else has already done that for me (thanks!).  All I can add--and this is mostly for the people who panned it--is:  You either Get It or you don't Get It; and if you don't Get It, you're not supposed to Get It.  No reflection on you, it's just the way it is, that's all. <br /> <br />I am so glad this album exists.
B000E97HIA|2.0|I knew we were in for another in a long line of disappointments when I saw the video for the first single, \\"Te Amo Corazon,\\" a few months ago.  It sounded, at the time, like a sleep-inducing bore.  When I heard the second single, \\"Black Sweat,\\" I began thinking this album would be worse than I initially feared.  At least \\"Te Amo\\" had a nice live-band feel.  \\"Black Sweat\\" was more of Prince's one-man-jam, stale sounding synth grooves - the kind of thing he can toss off in a couple hours.  Basically, if these were the two songs Prince had confidence would sell this album, I knew to expect the worst.  <br /> <br />Then I saw the SNL performance where a fired-up Prince tore through a hard rocking tune called \\"Fury.\\"  Hmmm, this seemed more like it.  Loved the high energy vocal and (especially) the guitar work.  Maybe I was wrong in my predictions about \\"3121\\" (more on \\"Fury\\" a little later). <br /> <br />Unfortunately, my initial thoughts proved true.  This album is another uninspired bore.  I didn't like \\"Musicology\\" either, and so I am perplexed by the positive reception that album received.  \\"3121\\" seems to be receiving a good amount of positive responses from both critics and fans.  What's going on here?  I know albums like \\"New Power Soul\\" and \\"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\\" were not masterpieces by any means.  But I can't fathom how anyone can find these recent albums to be any better.   <br /> <br />Here are the sad facts:  Prince apparently no longer has it in him to write melodic, structured, memorable songs... AND, the one-man-band approach stopped working for him years ago.  Yes, there are a few tracks on this album with contributions from other musicians, but most of it is just Prince.  The songs are dull, plodding, and rhythmically leaden.  And while I understand some fans find it unfair to compare new Prince material with his prime years, I believe that an artist's best work sets the standard by which everything else is judged. <br /> <br />Looking at \\"3121\\"from that perspective, it fails miserably on pretty much all levels.  Lest anyone think I mercilessly hated the entire album, there were a few interesting tracks.  Even though it can't hold a candle to the absolutely electrifying rendtion on SNL, \\"Fury\\" may just be the best tune on this album.  I wish it had the raw, guitar rock sound that so benefited it live.  But if one song sticks in my mind (so far, after hearing the album only a couple times), it's \\"Fury.\\"  I also liked the album closer \\"Get On the Boat\\" - nothing special melodically or lyrically, but still a nice funky groove with percussion from Sheila E. and a some welcome horn solos.  The album's requisite slow-jam ballad, \\"Satisfied,\\" is also nothing we haven't heard Prince do before (and better, in fact).  But I have always loved Prince's falsetto ballads, and this one benefits from a relatively brief running time (under 3 minutes).  And here's a real surprise, considering my very first reaction to the song: \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" - in the context of a very synthetic, sterile-sounding album - emerges as perhaps the strongest melody, and it's relaxed Latin arrangement (with a nice array of musicians) really distinguishes the track. Oh, and I guess \\"Lolita\\" has kind of a catchy, fun feel (though it's a throwaway). <br /> <br />Well, if you're still with me at this point, hopefully you can see I'm not being a \\"hater\\" or anything like that.  I have loved Prince since I first heard \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" when I was 10 years old.  But aside from \\"The Truth\\" (disc four from 1998's \\"Crystal Ball\\" set), I don't think Prince has issued a truly cohesive, consistant album since \\"The Gold Experience.\\"  But every other one of his albums of the past ten years has contained some worthwhile tracks, and this one is no exception.  I just get the feeling that Prince could definitely do much better if he put more effort into it.

B000AMWIVM|3.0|When you see it you will know what I am  talking about, the goriest part was just absolutely pointless.<br /><br />So other than than it was a mildly entertaining movie.<br /><br />One of the main problems I had with this movie is not setting up danny glover's character, this was just stupid in my opinion.<br /><br />Also the guy running the game was also kind of stupid when you learn all that is going on.  i think the movie would be better if they left some things untold and better involvement for the smaller characters would have helped.<br /><br />Overall gore when they didn't need it, a lot of wholes, and the fact that I never got that tension feeling I was looking for from the 2 main character.<br /><br />Other than that, it was pretty entertaining, rent it don't buy it.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|I remember first seeing this film when I was 10 in 1972 on the telly.  It was somewhat terrifying to me then as a child, but it was a film I couldn't forget once I realised that it was only a film.  This isn't your basic Dracula film and that is what is great about it.  It is different.  Don't take the comedy too seriously as it is rather off beat in spots.  It is more amusing than funny.  This is a good nostalgia film from the 60's with a great music score and some wonderful sets.  It's great for snowy nights.
B000301YY8|3.0|This CD is fantastic.  One of the best to come around in years!  I have a 300+ collection, and since buying this CD, I reach for it most.  Every single song is either thought provoking, sad, witty, all these different, strange emotions at once.  His show at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia was unforgettable.  Don't be put off by the negative reviews.  If you want to listen to something unique and beautiful, buy this CD.  You will not regret it!
0394716787|5.0|I am so happy to finally get my own copy of these tales!<br /><br />I love the stories of Edgar Allen Poe!<br /><br />Only problem with this book, which is very minor, the print is too small.
B00005JOFQ|2.0|All the reviews are sort of funny. I rate movies on their entertainment value. Just because it was the first of its kind or different does not automatically make it any good. Another year of the awards season and another year of great disappointment. Million Dollar Baby last year started the downward slide for me. Everyone talked about it but it really wasn't that good.  Same with this movie BB. For purely entertainment value it has no substance. My wife personally hates any movie that advocates cheating on your spouse behind their back so that does make her a little biased.<br /><br />So from an entertainment value perspective, this movie just doesn't perform. It is a good one to maybe rent for a few dollars, but if you buy it (and you actually have a taste for entertainment), then you will be greatly dissapointed.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Painc! At the Disco is an amazing group. They will be going far and I hope that more people start to listen to them. <br /> <br />If someone likes Fall Out Boy...they will love this group. The fast paced...happy go lucky music is what I listen to when I'm having a bad day.
B00005R2IS|4.0|This movie is so freaking action packed, you actually are asking for a break from it and when you get your break , this movie hits you with one of those really hard to take drama scenes.<br /><br />but the action is the reason to watch this.  The camera work is outstanding the way they follow the motorcycle in one scene is really a rush just watching it.  It opens up with action and gives you just enough to make it a really good movie.<br /><br />One of the MANY reasons I love this movie is the hero.  I watch a lot of kungfu, and this type of storyline for mel is kungfu at it's finest.  He really reminded me of a guy like Jimmy Wang Yu or even one of my favorites Chen Kwan Tai(baddie from crippled avengers).  Mel plays the role just as good as any of them and maybe better.<br /><br />The commentary is also listenable and a pretty good making of.
B00003CXDB|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie as current and as interesting as it was when it first came out. A brilliant director and talented actors contributed, but the most  <br />important was, and is,  the script, still fresh and very much to the point.  One does not quote any more \\"Greed is Good\\" because it is politically incorrect.  But, believe it, it  still rules Wall Street and the corporate world.  The latest news about the selling of America proves it. I can recommend this DVD without any qualms. <br />
B000E97HIA|3.0|Well my first go-round with the CD is.. \\"mixed\\" 2 say the least. However; after listening 2 this CD 4 the past week and a half some songs have grown on me.  The first 2 songs,,, rather good.  But Prince is not one 4 Synthesizers and all that.  I read he once took synthesizers out of his studio and put them in his hallway with a sign reading \\"Old Friends 4 Sale\\".  His reviews compared this CD 2 \\"1999\\", \\"Gold\\", \\"Dirty Mind\\" and I do not agree.  Not enough \\"real\\" instruments and 2 much electronics.  I would honestly say that this is mid-level of his albums as far as my likes.  And I have been a fan since 1980!!!  Die Hard PRN fan!  I know a lot are jumping on the bandwagon and suddenly becoming a Prince fan but I have been here for 26 years!  I probably paid 4 Paisley Park with my $$$!  I have everything this guy has put out and will not stop getting his stuff but this one???  And a female singing co-lead on a PRINCE CD?????  This was not a duet but PRINCE!  Come on man.  Be who u were back in the day when u were original and cutting edge!  When the lingere and the \\"I do not care what people say about me\\" attitude were what was thought of when the name \\"Prince\\" came up.  There are a few good songs here: ie<br />1) 3121.  I think this is hinting towards the New System<br />2) Lolita. Catchy and kinda dancey<br />3) The Word the melody is good but the message is WAY too \\"preachy\\"<br />4) Beautiful, Loved, and Blessed:: quite possibly a new Prince fav of mine?  I suggest seriously listening to the words and u may like it as much as I do.<br /><br />As 4 the others?  Well just ok down 2 sub-par.  The aforementioned songs are the ones that drive this album and make it worth the purchase.  Prince is still the best and always will be.  I just think that the religion factor should be kept out.  We all know u are a Witness Prince no need to try 2 convert us.  Some of us left 4 a reason.<br /> and one or two decent ones but the others are just WAY 2 commercial.  That is my opinion.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I am in no way a paid intern!!!!  This CD is amazing!  Prince has always been the musician's musician.  His music is neither dated or boring and he has been pumping out music for over 20+ years.  But I digress.....3121 brings Prince back to his Pop sexual feeling music and I am glad he did.  All tracks flow into one another and I cannot stop listening to it.  Thank you Prince.
0060736267|5.0|I read this book twice in my early teens. I'm 41 now and decided to re-read it when a friend told me she was doing the same. What a treat! It is just as absorbing for me today as it was nearly thirty years ago. In this latest reading I picked up on more of the adult themes of the novel and could more appreciate Smith's writing style. Francie is among the most fully drawn characters of any book I've read. Smith's attention to detail is exquisite as is her ability to convey the conflicts and longings inside so many of the characters. I was also struck by how many of the passages depicted food--which makes sense, since when there isn't enough of it, it is bound to be a focal point. The ending is so touching that I wept, just as I had as a young girl. This is a wonderful story with universal and timeless themes of loneliness, love, poverty and hope.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Beyond Excellent quality merchandise and superfast delivery.  A pleasure to do business with.  A+++++
0792164903|5.0|This movie starts out with Christopher Lee talking, I honestly can't think of a better way to start a movie like this.<br /><br />So this is a fairy tale that plays out like a real movie, it's kind of hard to explain, but this movie does have  agood realism about it.<br /><br />Johhny Depp has come to town to find the headless horsmen.<br /><br />That is really all you need to know, not every scene is a classic, but the action scenes are wonderful.  The horseman is really bad-ass.  Christopher Walkien plays he horseman with a head, but looks way cooler without it.<br /><br />Some very sick moments, btu only like 1 or 2.  So the kids like 9 and over will probably be ok with this.  Overall the gore is very styleish.<br /><br />I love pretty much about this movie, except for a few scenes that I thought could have been better.  But the music was the best part for me.  It was so loud and strong, it exacted what the atmosphere looked like.  I don't know who scored it but he did an awesome job.<br /><br />The commentary is so-so, better than most.  And the making of is alright, but buy this dvd for the movie.<br /><br />VERY COOL.
B00003CX9S|5.0|The 1980 Oscar Nominations for Best Picture were COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER, RAGING BULL, and ELEPHANT MAN.  (EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was NOT nominated.)       Personally I thought COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER was OK but found RAGING BULL to be crude and offensive (although in it's sincerity an excellent picture.)         Best Actor went to Robert De Niro for RAGING BULL but John Hurt actually was THE actor of 1980.  His portrail of John Merrick was a great moment in Cinematic History.  Robert De Niro gained a bunch of pounds for the part and was loud and obnoxious and did a great job of it for saying \\"F**K\\" but for pure emotional acting ability John Hurt beat De Niro hands down. \\"I AM A HUMAN BEING\\"  (Jack Nicholson was NOT nominated for his part as Jack Torrance in \\"THE SHINING\\")       Anthony Hopkins was NOT nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Joe Pesci won this award for RAGING BULL.  This is a crime.       Best Director went to Robert Redford for ORDINARY PEOPLE.         David Lynch, , Roman Polanski and Richard Rush were also nominated along with Martin Scorsese (sorry for the previous mis-informed info on the Best Director winner)       Best Supporting Actress went to Mary Steenburgen for MELVIN AND HOWARD but what happened to Anne Bancroft?  No nomination for an incredible job which went (even though I really liked Mary Steenburgen) WAY beyond as far as an ACTING performance.        In a world where these discrepancies exist STAR WARS was second to ANNIE HALL for cripes sakes.  How many times have you seen ANNIE HALL ???  How many times have you seen STAR WARS ??  You tell me which was the better picture.  ELEPHANT MAN came up against RAGING BULL and a big left hook sent the pride of 1980 back to the side show.       Do not forget David Lynch and what he did.  Do not forget John Hurt and do not forget in 1980 we had what will be remembered as the BEST movie of the year-hang the Oscars.       By the way the DVD is GREAT and the extras are fine and the price is way too low.
B00005QZWI|3.0|The score goes well when you are watching the movie but on it's own it has basically one theme repeated over and over. It's OK but not worthy of an Academy Award in my opinion. Harry Potter should have won instead. When you consider Howard Shore has won more Oscars (3) than Elmer Bernstein and Jerry Goldsmith put together you wonder whats going on.
B00003ZKS1|5.0|This album is a sleeper. Schenker's debut came out in 1980, a year when more then a few ground breaking albums hit store shelves. Even most serious hardrock/metal fans are completely oblivious to this album, i find this unacceptable! It has never truely recived the credit it deserved, i mean, for it's time, the guitar playing mastery of this man was absolutley unheard of and unapproachable. Micheal's combination of emotion and skill was unbeatable, i will never forget hearing \\"Armed & Ready\\" for the first time, and being blown out the window. <br /> <br /> <br />It is his most important/signifigant album, as it was his first time on his own, having just left UFO and Scorpions, and asembling a new band from the ground up. This first release was his greatest solo album i think, it was like he had something to prove to the world and to his old band mates. It's definatly one of the most underrated albums in rock. <br /> <br />MSG, the follow up, while good, didn't have the same level of energy of spirit as the debut. It was more commercial sounding but in a twisted sence of irony, the production sucked. This album is where he had it all right, best line-up, strongest material, great sound, as it was produced by Deep Purple/Rainbow bassist Roger Glover. <br /> <br />I'm amazed that he has never got his due in America. He was never popolur here, only in Europe. His style could make Eddie Van Halen cry himself to sleep. <br /> <br />Let's also not forget the OTHER virtuoso on the album, the drumming wonder Simon Philips.He is one of the greatest drummers ever. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
0307276902|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  Despite the controversy, I know personally that the book gives good and complete detail on what it is like to go to rehab and change your life.  Maybe the author didn't go through all the situations discussed in the book, but he sure did a wonderful job of protraying every type of individual you meet in rehab.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|In the spirit of full disclosure, I'm a lifer when it comes to Marillion.  I discovered them with Misplaced Childhood, and have been a fan ever since. I own some of Fish's solo albums and all of the Steve Hogarth-era Marillion albums and even a couple of non-Marillion Steve Hogarth albums.  I've proudly pre-ordered Marillion's last two studio albums (Marbles and Anoraknophobia) and I own a few of their DVD's.   Bottom line is: They change, they grow and somehow they keep making beatiful, honest and powerful music and I keep enjoying it.  I don't love every album or embrace every song they put out, but I still count myself as one of their fans. <br /> <br />Marillion isn't a \\"progressive rock band\\" in the 1970's sense because unlike most \\"progressive\\" bands that (paradoxically) don't progress, Marillion actually has.  They make pop songs, they make rock songs and they make long, epic songs that can take the listener on powerful emotional journeys. Every album is different, while still capturing some degree of that classic \\"Marillion sound\\".  That \\"sound\\" is all over Marbles, but this album isn't a retrogressive \\"progressive\\" rock album.  <br /> <br />Marbles is progressive rock in the sense that the band has evolved over the years, and the music itself, a kind of rock, progresses from moment to moment, often defying traditional song structures in favor of a more cinematic approach to composition.  There are a few pop songs on this album, and they're quite good.  But most Marillion fans aren't interested in the radio singles, they're interested in the big, epic songs and there are more than a few on Marbles. <br /> <br />But you don't need to be a music major to enjoy this music.  All you really need is an open mind and a heart.  There are no keyboard solos that make you think progressive rock should be an Olympic sport and there are few jarring turns or pretentious, self indulgient passages.  In fact, part of what makes Marbles an amazing album is that while there ismasterful musicianship going on, the music is so easy on the ears that what you notice is how lovely the songs are, not how skilled the musicians are. <br /> <br />If you're a Marillion fan who lost the thread at some point, Marbles has many classic Marillion sounding moments. It's as strong musically and emotionally as Brave, but the songs stand up better by themselves.  Marbles combines the best elements of Misplaced Childhood, Afraid of Sunlight, Brave and Anoraknophobia into an album with no weak moments. I would say \\"Marillion is back\\", but really, they never left.   <br /> <br />If you're a Fish devotee, give Marbles a try.  Steve Hogarth is an honest and powerful singer and a strong lyricist.  What he might lack (in comparison to Fish) in vocabulary or clever turns of phrase, he makes up for with a stronger melodic sense, and lyrics that are both specific enough to be true, but non-specific enough to allow room for other people to find themselves in them.  Besides, the Fish vs. H argument is kind of done, isn't it? <br /> <br />If you're not a Marillion fan, but you enjoy Crowded House/Finn Brothers/Neil Finn or Tim Finn, you'll find something to love on Marbles.  If you enjoy Coldplay, Peter Gabriel, Pink Floyd or even Radiohead, you'll likely find something to enjoy here too.  In fact, if you like great music made by a real band with real musicians, go get yourself some Marbles.  You won't be sorry.
630460288X|4.0|Oh this was such a great movie.  The sci-fi world is looked at from the comedics point of view and man does it work.  This movie has the same of action comedy element like die hard 3.<br /><br />The director does a good job of making everbody look bad ass and you really don't know what snipes is capable of.  Throw is some really cool stuff, and a lot of things breaking and you will have a fun ride with this.
B0000DZEA1|2.0|All this does is repeat the one theme from the 1st movie. It went well with the movie but just sitting and listening to it by itself it does not hold up well. It is not something I would listen to again.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|I am a huge DM fan.  My first album was Some Great Reward.  I loved every song on that album and every song on all of their other albums up until the release of Ultra.  Then it was just a song here and there. <br /> <br />Since Ultra, the boys seem to have fallen into a rut.  They continue to recycle simple songs and sounds that are just OK.  Nothing new, original or exciting.  There have been no new grab-you-and-keep-you songs like \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" or \\"Something to Do\\" or \\"World In My Eyes\\".  Even their really, really early stuff like \\"My Secret Garden\\" and \\"More Than a Party\\" were better original stand-alones than what they have to offer now. <br /> <br />Most of the songs on Playing the Angel sound recycled.  Let's face it...doesn't \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" sound very much like \\"The Dead of Night\\"?  And \\"John the Revelator\\" sounds like a slightly faster variation of \\"The Dead of Night\\". <br /> <br />While the second half of the album was interesting, I was really disappointed by Playing the Angel.  I had hoped, after thinking that Exciter would be their very last album, that this would be a great resurgence of the complex, passionate, sexy, and provocative music that forever made me a fan.  And while it is still gloomy and dark and better than Ultra and Exciter, there is just a special Depeche Mode element that has been missing for sometime. <br /> <br />Regardless, I still love Depeche Mode and remain a dedicated fan.  I will be traveling to Mexico to see them in May...and then to Chicago the following week.  And if they release another album in a few years, I will buy that one and add it to my DM collection. <br />
B000EOTAM6|2.0|I'm not really a fan of MTV, but Aeon Flux was original and interesting.  Sadly, the movie is not.  The plot had potential--except that it didn't appear until the last 15 minutes.  The writers spent too much time with techno gadgets (YOU ARE IN THE FUTURE) crap, and showing Aeon's acrobatics (ISN'T SHE COOL?) to create any decent suspense.  Charlize Theron, Oscar Winner, is evidently too good to wear the more revealing costume Aeon wore in the series.  Ironic--Hollywood felt the need to put Halley Berry in a cut to ribbons costume when the original Catwoman was fully suited in leather, but they do the reverse here. Go figure.  Overall the movie was okay--a rental.<br /><br />It's these subpar, flighty movies with big name actresses that give Science Fiction/Fantasy a bad name.  And give Hollywood the mistaken impression that the public doesn't want action movies with heroines.  No, we want GOOD action movies with heroines.  And Jennifer Garner, Halle Berry and Charlize Theron aren't talented enough (or too talented?) to supply them.  I guess all my hopes are now pinned on Wonder Woman, please let her be a newcomer....
0446677450|1.0|A long time ago I read the great short book, How to Get Rich and Stay Rich by Fred Young.  To get rich, Fred says you can: <br /> <br />1.  Inherit it <br />2   Marry it <br />3.  Make more money than you spend and invest the difference. <br /> <br />Since 1 and 2 are out for most people, he recommends 3. <br /> <br />And that, in one sentence, is better advice than the whole bloated RDPD pep talk. <br /> <br />You can spend years researching and becoming a good investor.  It's not nearly as easy as this author implies.  There are many good books and authors to guide you.  Peter Lynch, John Swenson, and yes, John Reed, if you are willing to WORK at the real estate BUSINESS.  And it's not an easy business. <br /> <br />This guy is just the latest \\"it's easy to be rich\\" guy.  And how does one get rich?  One buys the many products and seminars that the guy has for sale at absurdly high prices. <br /> <br />For free, you can learn all about real estate, stocks, bonds, and owning a business, all at your public library.  That is what I would recommend instead.
B0000AYL16|5.0|It sounds very good in SACD Format. Also the newly added Songs are good too.
0312995423|5.0|I found this book to be an excellent thriller - and didn't want to put it down - really exciting.
0783219695|5.0|He should have won three Oscars in a row! This is better than Forrest Gump & Philadelphia, it has absolutely everything going for it. Cast, effects, writing, costume, music, cinematography, and most of all the fact that it is based on true events. So even though you know what happened it still is a thrilling ride - right until the end.  <br />If I could give 6 stars for any movie this would be it (maybe Ed Wood too). Everyone in this movie does a perfect job, a perfect gathering of talent. It is so good that everytime I watch this movie I find something else to like about it. this is very rare I think but Apollo 13 sustains interest well beyond the first viewing.
1400049628|4.0|If you like your humor a bit on the dry and cerebral side, then you should give this a read. It is not a novel, but rather a guidebook to surviving zombie outbreaks. Information is presented as though it were completely factual, and not once does the author break character (to \\"look at the camera\\" so to speak). The only giveaway is the \\"humor\\" listing in the title pages, and the fact that zombies don't exist... or do they?<br /><br />Aside from being a humorous look at what life might be like if the undead roamed our streets, this book might also provide supplemental detail to role-playing gamers. Any modern-day campaign with a sci-fi or horror bent could easily benefit from ideas and scenarios presented in this book.<br /><br />This book does not contain tongue-in-cheek jokes, puns or over-the-top comedy of the sort typically proided in humorous texts. The author has completely invested himself in the guise of a survival guide writer. Every last detail is meticulously scrutinized as though your survival depended upon it. I personally found this hilarious and engaging. Scenarios and minor points I never would have thought of in dealing with zombies were presented clearly and with interesting background information.<br /><br />I pick it up from time to time and re-read sections and pick up new and intriguing details. Clearly the work of a (delightfully) demented and obsessive mind!
006056251X|5.0|The sweet and the cute refer to the storyline and the ending, which is one of Kleypas's best.  The gorgeous however refers to Sebastion!  Hahaha, I adore the reformed rake story and Evageline did a great job at it.  She's my favorite wallflower and she tames the baddest of the bad and the dangerously handsome St. Vincent, who isn't such a monster underneath it all.  The Devil in Winter is sometimes funny and has its tender moments, but mostly, it's a great continuation to an entertaining quartet.
B000E97HIA|5.0|The fans have already spoken and this is an album for fans of Prince's most commercial work. As much as I despise reviews that predict the commercial success of an album (an approach that is killing music and ensured that some of Prince's greatest work, including \\"The Truth\\", which is a work of genius, remains unheard by the sheepish masses), be warned: this album is going to be a monster!    In the early Eighties, Prince, as everyone knows, released the legendary \\"1999\\" album, built around the topical and timely concept of an apocalyptic vision of the future in the nuclear age. It was the perfect signifier for his passionate, obsessive themes of eros and thanatos and celebrated a conscious revolution of the sexual, beyond the sexual: a neo-hippy movement (\\"All the hippies sing together\\") which he fathered. That movement became The Revolution (aptly named), evolving into the Paisley Park label, before it finally matured into the New Power Generation. In 2006, Prince has released \\"3121\\", which comments very little on our times; instead, it revisits and revises those themes, both lyrically and musically, which is how this album succeeds.    In the Eighties, Prince's vision of the future truly made him visionary. \\"3121\\", however, is a stunningly vivid collage of lessons of the past. Those seeking the adventure and innovation of masterpieces like \\"Parade\\" will be disappointed; in fact, they may even cry \\"Sell out!\\" But Prince has proven in the past that he is definitely his own man and the fact that this album doesn't sound like anyone else but so-called \\"classic\\" Prince should confirm that, more than anything else, \\"3121\\" is Prince at play, enjoying being true to himself.    A mark of Prince's genius has always been the one song or more on every album that doesn't sound like any other song recorded in the history of music. It is the greatest pleasure any artist can give to the listener: the musical equivalent of a first kiss with your one true love. Can you name any song that sounds even remotely similar to \\"Rasberry Beret\\"? Of course, you can't. \\"3121\\" is this album's genuine original: the funkiest, nastiest, sexiest work Prince has produced since \\"Sexy MF\\". The vocal reacquaints you with the immortal Camille but precious little else is familiar. Although the song casts itself as a \\"futuristic fantasy\\", it is more like a lyrical reworking of \\"Darling Nikki\\" in every respect except for two things: there are oriental, perhaps even taoist allusions; and the fatalism of \\"1999\\" and \\"Purple Rain\\" has been revised with an exhileratingly ominous declaration of our sweet Prince being here to stay (\\"You can come if you want to / But you can never leave\\"). Again, this the expression of an artist who knows he is at his best.    As I'm sure most fans will recognise, \\"Lolita\\" echoes \\"Soft and Wet\\", although the production is jaw-droppingly free of bells and whistles and all their shackles. This may be why it sounds so modern, despite its Eighties-style construction. The song also features the popular catch-phrases of older recordings by The Time (\\"Fellas, how bad is this groove?\\"). Not surprisingly, the song is receiving virtually continuous airplay on Australian radio and would be a logical choice for a third single.    \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" is unique amongst Prince compositions, which is precisely why it infuriated as many established Prince fans as it awed. The fans it infuriated have obviously long forgotten how many of them wanted to throw their vinyl record of \\"Parade\\" against a brick wall before, a week later, they realised, like me, that \\"Parade\\" was and is the man's finest album. \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" is a delicate, layered work of art, further elevated by intimate, insightful lyrics (\\"Once when I first laied eyes on you /I saw heaven and earth anew\\") and typically sumptuous strings.    \\"Black Sweat\\" is the equally attractive cousin of \\"Kiss\\". When you first hear it, you may even think he can do this in his sleep, which is precisely the point.As the song says, \\"I don't wanna dance too hard / But this is a groove\\". Amen to that. Some have compared this mind-scrambling groove to the work of The Neptunes but Pharrell only wishes he could write something this intelligently infectious. Prince's trademark wit (\\"You'll be screaming like a white lady\\"), complete with delightfully deliquent androgeny, again transgresses all the dull, conformity that plagues contemporary radio-friendly hits. This may just be the music they play in neo-hippy heaven.    \\"Incense and Candles\\" is the closest thing to sex incarnate Prince will share these days with anyone other than his wife. Prince used to prefer \\"slamming\\" but now he likes to slow down, take his time and visit, even make, new worlds in the mind. Hence, this song is the centrepiece for the revelations introduced by the title track. Musically, the oriental influences are reintroduced as well. The song would be another worthy single.    \\"Love\\" is an ambitious piece. The arrangement is reminiscent of \\"I Want To Melt With U\\" but the heavy use of reverb delivers on its promise of warmer, engulfing vibes. The message is simple (\\"Love is free\\") but Prince, as usual, makes it sound like it's never been said before.    \\"Satisfied\\" is better than \\"Do Me, Baby\\" ever was at seducing the listener both literally and metaphorically. Prince always wrote, indeed seduced, on an intuitive level, blurting out brilliantly blunt truths along way like John Lennon; now he brings the wisdom of wider experience to his game. \\"Foreplay starts in the mind\\", he sings and how can anyone argue with him?    \\"Fury\\" is one of my personal favorite songs on the album and showcases more than one sizzling guitar solo. It rocks ... hard. The lyric is presumably directed at his lovely ex wife, Mayte, and comments she may have made in the press. Unless Universal totally lose their minds, this, too, will be a single.    Like Dylan before him, Prince reached new heights of unpopularity when what could be termed his \\"born again\\" period began, but it will be difficult for even the most cynical critics to dismiss a song as immaculate, in every sense, as \\"The Word\\". Scored by a subtle electro rhythm and melody, I can't remember the last time I was so moved by a Prince lyric: \\"...the truth has got to told / No matter how shiny ur lips r / They'll never b streets of gold..\\"        \\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed\\", a duet with Tamar, is a case of Daddy Pop and his new protege looking in the mirror and reciting an exquisite affirmation of divine humanism. It is happily aimed at a wide audience and likely to win it.     For some strange reason, this allbum includes, albeit in a drastically improved version, \\"The Dance\\", a song previously released on Prince's criminally overlooked album, \\"The Chocolate Invasion\\", available now through the website: [...] For those who haven't heard it before, \\"The Dance\\" is an epic tale of lust, self-doubt and tortured desire, in the tradition of \\"Something In The Water\\". It is the album's only curiosity but its inclusion here is obviously an indicator of how much Prince personally likes the song. As such, it is best received as a valentine from someone close.    Lastly, \\"Get On The Boat\\", like \\"Dear Mr Man\\" on \\"Musicolgy\\", exceeds all reasonable expectations as the album's political statement. Prince applies irresistible peer pressure on the proles to become conscious(\\"We got room for a hundred more\\"). The James Brown style horns give the song a gospel edge that almost make it the funky equivalent of \\"Purple Rain\\". Maceo Parker has scarcely played better than he does on his solo.    Back in the day, C. Moon loved to tell the story of how he pitched Prince to Warner Bros. He apparently said, \\"I think I've found the new Stevie Wonder\\". Many times, I've tried to imagine the excitement that must have been in the room when C. Moon played Prince to \\"the suits\\" for the first time. Warner Bros must be kicking themselves now because that's just how this record defines itself and the man who made it. If anything, after \\"3121\\", every other artist out there may only be able to dream forever after of receiving the highest of all compliments: to, one day, be called the new Prince.
B000002L61|5.0|This cd is awsome. I don't know why I waited til now to get it but oh well, doesn't change how cool it is. Dio is one of my favorite bands. If you are a true Dio fan you must get this cd.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is that rarest of things- a quiet movie that seems very traditional that is actually quite revolutionary.  It tells a simple story that is actaully very complicated.  It looks like a simple movie yet is filled with subtle brilliance.  Watch it for how a place can become a character.  Watch for how many parallels exist between acts and situations throughout this wonderful film.  It is a joy to have in the classics of cinema.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is a really good album. It is hard for a musician like David Gilmour to create a album that is in the same league as  Dark Side of the Moon or Animals and this one is if you ask me. On An Island bassicly sticks to the classic Pink Floyd formula but is also very original and is well worth the money.

0385486804|4.0|The plot of Into the Wild, written by Jon Krakauer, is quite an intriguing one.  It begins in medias res (in the middle of the story), and therefore is full of suspense right from the get go.  It revolves around a young man named Chris McCandles a.k.a. Alex, who has just recently graduated from college.  He leaves his home in Washington and travels out west in search of purpose to his life.  It is a very interesting recollection of events that occured to him there like his stays in little western towns, or his odyssey to Alaska.  Also Krakauer does a great job of recapping events that had happened in Chris's life before his adventures, and relating other adventurers who went through similar experiences. <br /> Chris becomes closely attached to quite a few strangers during his travels, and learns a lot of the hardships of life.  According to the story he had a comfortable upbringing, but never saw his hard working parents much.  He did anything he tried well, and was great at academics and sports.  However, he turned his back on this and his family, and for more than two years he started to make his own journey.  Krakauer connects himself to this with his own troubles with his overbearing father.  Also how he went off alone and climbed the Devils Thumb.   <br /> Whilst in Alaska Chris did many dangerous things that many have deemed as arrogant and showing naivety.  For one, people first criticized him for calling a caribou a moose, but it really was a moose.  Also he went out into the woods of Alaska with only minimal provisions and could have easily died almost any day.  Krakauer tries to point out some of the intelligent choices Chris made, as to defend him from the bombardments of criticism.  Like how he researched what vegetation was good to eat, and how to prepare the game that he killed with his rifle. <br /> All in all, the story is a great look into the life of a young man, as he is trying to find his bearings.  Unfortunately he meets his death in Alaskaas he hurts his leg and is unable to get the food he needs to survive.  So you could see this as a kind of foresight as to not forsake  good things that come to you in life, and if you try to rush things, they can go terribly wrong.  So we can use what we know of Chris and Krakauer, to make better decisions in our lives. <br />
B000E97HIA|4.0|I rate this 3-1/2 stars. <br />Prince reminds me so much of Eric Clapton - not in a musical sense because Prince and Clapton's music doesn't sound even remotely similar, but it's the fact that both of them apparently cannot reproduce in the studio what they can play live.  I listen to this new album and you can almost hear how much better this material will sound live - a perfect example being Prince's performance of \\"Fury\\" on Saturday Night Live a few weeks ago. I mean, he seriously ROCKED!!! But on the album, the song is just good, but live it was spectacular!  The album as a whole is pretty good with four stand-out tracks - the best   being \\"Love\\", \\"Fury\\", \\"Lolita\\" and the gospel-ish \\"Satisfied\\".  The rest of the album is good as well, but the album as a whole feels like it is missing \\"something\\" and that \\"something\\" is what Prince can deliver live. Can't wait to see you at MSG in a few months!!!
0783240287|4.0|I love this play.  Not being a huge Webber fan it is kind of an abberation for me.  There is something about the many different styles of songs mixed together that just pulls me in.  I really enjoyed this.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|Jarhead, based on the autobiography of former U.S. Marine Anthony Swafford, is not nearly as bad as previous reviewers have claimed it to be. It is important to note that this movie is NOT attempting to make a statement about warfare - neither for nor against it, and it is not providing a commentary on the current situation in Iraq. Instead, Jarhead puts a movie camera in front of a Marine platoon and then lets the viewer decide for himself or herself. <br /> <br />Through Swafford (played by Jake Gyllenhall) and other characters, we are given a glimpse on the emotional toll that life in the armed forces takes on recruits. Being thrown into the midst of a war complicates matters ten times worse. Emotions range from excitement, brotherhood, fear, anger, and alienation. I appreciated the fact that the film tried to get this point across to the viewers. <br /> <br />Gyllenhall gives a great performance as Swafford, but the star who steals the movie is Jamie Foxx who plays Sargeant Sykes, a Los Angeles native who values the corps more than he values his own life. <br /> <br />The movie may not have too many scenes of action, but there is plenty of drama and emotion nonetheless. This is a movie that is definitely worth seeing, but be forewarned...there is a fairly large amount of sexual humor, nudity, and masturbation in this film (as odd as that might sound).
0393312836|5.0|i picked this book up yesterday. and upon initial viewing i was, to say the least, feeling like i might have wasted my money. i viddied the first couple of pages and thought i could never cut through all the nadsat slang, and get to any understanding of the story. this fear quickly disappeared as i found myself finishing it in one night. the language used in this book is both easy to pick up and gives the book a fun, fast driven sort of rhythm. it also serves as a funny inside joke when later in the book, characters comment about how funny alex talks and how they cant understand what hes saying, cause you can. also after reading the real final chapter left out of both the original american release and the stanley kubrik adaption of the book the story comes full circle and give the novel a completely different and much deeper and complete feel. without it, in my opinion, it is a different story. i wont go into it for fear of ruining it for those of you who haven't laid your glazzies on it yet, but i will say that if you have an extra $13.95 laying around (and if you dont, grab some of your closest droogs and steal it) go directly to a bookstore and pick it up. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED
0307276902|2.0|True sobriety is a beautiful thing and will change your life completely.  One of the first steps in achieving that kind of sobriety is soul-searching 'rigorous honesty'.  <br /> <br />Prior to the author's revelations in the media, I bought this book to read while on a cross country trip. Within the first hour of reading I put the book down and left it on the plane. <br />I had no desire to finish it - It just didn't ring true. <br /> <br />Recovery is serious business and people in meetings share from their heart about real experiences. When you hear from them first hand it makes it hard to listen to someone who is manufacturing their story merely for the sake of storytelling. <br /> <br />All the best to those of you who are sincerely trying to work a program in sobriety. However I do not feel this book will be of any value in attaining that goal.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|Any moron can slice and dice newsclips to fit their \\"alternate view of reality\\" - it's a pity that liberals are to stupid to take an objective view of current events.
B00007KWHG|3.0|A lot of the songs on this album are great. Of course, that's why I bought it. However, there are a number of lower-quality songs which I sometimes think would be better off of the album so as to not dilute its class. <br /> <br />However, the album's real problem is it's recording quality. Many, many of the songs, including some that are not so old, possess serious clipping and distortion, and become unpleasant to hear. <br />I started wondering - have these songs always had this distortion, and have I just been ignoring it - or has some form of remastering made this album particularly bad? Possibly this is the case, but the recordings sound very harsh, even for 'Can't Take Me Eyes Off You', which is a surprise given its later recording date. It is a veritable pleasure to listen to 'December, 1963', which is clearly much higher quality recording - much smoother and without any of the harshness of most of the rest of the album. <br /> <br />Still, I don't know if this is a problem that can ever be resolved, so this album may still be the best that you can get for a collection on Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.
B00007JGHM|4.0|A very good romantic comedy, Kate & Leopold, brings to the screen the story of a 19th century down-on-his-luck English nobleman who travels to NY in search of an American bride who can help him pay his debts.

B00004U8PA|5.0|received the film quickly, it was in excellent condition, all in all a good transaction
B000002GQK|2.0|To my ear, this album, while having a few seconds here and there of pleasant music which tricks you into believing something good is about to happen, it instead leaves you waiting in vain for anything enjoyable, interesting or catchy. I bought this album, trusting the band would live up to their name. But a lot of the vocals are sung flat and a lot of the writing sounds like a song-writing attempt of 13 year olds with no musical talent. Steer away from this album. Those who praised it as a \\"masterpiece\\" ... well, I can only conclude that they never heard the album.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|From the opening scene, with Bill Nighy as a brilliantly funny, <br />burnt-out British rock star pathetically groveling (and yet, still finding a way to stick it to the man) for a comeback, this movie grabs you by the proverbial throat (in a good way!) and doesn't let go until way beyond the final scene.   <br /> <br />The all-star (and quite stellar) cast includes Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Laura Linney, the drop-dead gorgeous Brazilian soccer star, Roderigo Santos, and a host of others.  The movie explores love in all its permutations.  This is a movie for those of us who have never quite given up hope of a perfect world and/or a perfect love. <br />

0312958455|5.0|Bosch is back and finally diving into his mother's murder case while he's been place on involuntary leave. Our favorite detective is put through the ringer and has to come face to face with some rather ulgy demons from his past.  One girlfriend hits the road and another is quickly picked up on the rebound.  For a workaholic, Bosch gets around.  This time, however, our rebound chick has some baggage--then again-so did our last girlfriend.  Her husband was a psycho-cop.  So maybe he just attracts women with serious baggage.  Though this was another multi-layered and complex case, I was able to figure out the real killer pretty early.  But with Connelly, the journey is just as intriguing as the destination.
B000002TYK|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been over ten years since this album was released.  Following the death of Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl began to polish and finish what was basically his first solo album (he plays every instrument and sings).  However, for whatever his reasons were, Dave credited  his touring band and formed the Foo Fighters along with former Nirvana \\"member\\" Pat Smear, Nate Mendel and William Goldsmith.  \\"Foo Fighters\\" was released in July of 1995, and immediately hit the radio.  \\"This is a Call\\", \\"I'll Stick Around\\", and \\"Big Me\\" became radio staples, and it was clear that the Foo were more than just the Nirvana drummers other band.  The album differs greatly from anything Nirvana had done, and really doesn't sound like any of the following Foo Fighters albums.  There are \\"fun\\" songs such as Big Me, kick ass songs such as Watershed, lost treasures such as Alone and Easy Target, and just pure signs of Dave's brilliance (For All The Cows).  This self-titled album, while far from there most popular, is in my opinion the Foo's best.  There is not one song to pass over on this record, and the fact that it was recorded in approximately seven days makes that fact even more phenomenal.  For some reason, it seems as if this has become the lost Foo album.  For many non-hardcore fans, if you weren't of the right age at the time of this albums release, you've probably never heard any of the non-singles.  If you fall under that category, buy this album!  You will not be dissapointed.  If your a hardcore, than you know the truth... The Colour and the Shape was not the first great Foo Fighters album.

B000B5UL7G|4.0|This CD contains the newest radio hits as well as some impressive experiments with other styles of music.  Robbie Williams continues to amaze me with his willingness to go beyond pop.

B000DWMN2S|4.0|Everyting is Illuminated is a beautiful black comedy. It's a very interesting unconventional film with jokes about cultural clashes and the serves some shocking and haunting moments of unforgotten memories. The lead characters include \\"Jonfan\\", Alex, Alex' grandfather, and \\"Jonfan's long estranged grandmother are brilliantly writen and portrayed by performances that was funny and touching. The various kinds of jokes between \\"Jonfan\\" and Alex were very funny at times. Even being a vegetarian is something of unconceivable in Alex's world. \\"Jonfan\\" relentlessly search for things to remind him of important events is the main plot, and it's the journey in foreign land that opens him up to the strange and haunting long lost memories of the people he encounters. He subjects himself to another cultural and the object-collecting hobby becomes less important than learning about the lives of the characters through those situations. The film is strange looking based on the style of camera work and flashbacks. The music score is very appropiate for a story like this. There are some beautiful exterior scenes. Considered that I have never seen the supporting actors in this film, I was quite taken by their performances. As for Elijah Wood, it seemed as though this potential star-showcase role had neglected to allow him to show enough range. It's interesting to see him the way he's dressed, makeup, hair, and expressions in this film. Suddenly, I am reminded of similarity between his role and Thora Birch in Ghost World.
0385507755|4.0|The book club that I belong to chose to read James Frey's book \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" despite a lot of negative publicity attached to this work both from exposure on the \\"Oprah\\" show and through other media critics.   The concensus of the members of the club was that the book was a brave and brilliant work, of great worth in terms of the way it could influence young people to stay away from drugs and, while some of the facts were not as factual as the author first declared, that the changes were \\"minor\\" (i.e. did not affect the overall story negatively)  and did not affect the message that came through loud and clear in Mr. Frey's writing. <br />
B000068PQ0|2.0|Other reviewers have pointed out that the first track pretty much borrows its melody straight from Cat Steven's \\"Father & Son\\". No one, however, seems to have mentioned that the only other track with a discernable melody to it , Track 3, lifts it's tune straight from the the 70s America hit \\"I Need You\\". Other than that, a lot of uninteresting studio sound effects & competely inane lyrics amount to nothing too significant going on here. Although I like experimental, trippy, psychadelic-type music, this one misses the mark. Syd Barret they are not.
B000002JOH|5.0|I felt I needed to respond to Soviet Soldier Alexi Volvistov (Stalingrad, U.S.S.R.) - One star?  That's a JOKE. Trying to berate Pantera fans for not agreeing with your assessment is also a joke.  Not sure who those deceased guitarists are you referenced in your rant, but if they played for Gorky Park or are the guys that the guitar dork magazines interview then I don't think that you should be pumping them up too much. The best part about Pantera is that they are not over technical, but groove - i.e. approachable for almost any hard rock fan.  That's why they have #1 albums, that's why they rule.
B000E97HIA|5.0|12 tracks of top notch Prince.  <br />More accessible and public friendly than 2004's Musicology, <br />this one should be all over the radio.  <br />Could easily have five or six singles. <br />First rate musicianship with Prince handling most of the instrumentation except Clare Fischer's strings and the NPG horns. <br />This one will sell itself. You just need to hear it.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|I thought this would be no good because there had been too much hype. Boy was I wrong. This is a great movie. The acting is really axcellent, with J Phoenix and R Witherspoon turning in spectacular performances as Johnny Cash and June Carter.  The actual singing is excellent and the music, under the direction of T Bone Burnett, is really great, very close to the original sound. A must see for music fanatics everywhere.
B00004WG2F|5.0|All around great acting from an outstanding cast.  The plot, while simple, is tidy enough to be worth watching multiple times over the years.  For me, this movie finally convinced me that Pitt was a versatile and extremely talented actor.  The other actors did fine, and Anthony Hopkins portrayal as the Colonel dang near stole the movie out from under Pitt.  This is one of my definite top 25 movies, if not higher.  I highly recommend it.
B000E33VWW|5.0|The most terrifying thing about the film \\"Capote\\", which only began screening recently here in Australia, is that the title of \\"monster\\" is lifted to reveal the whole complex network of influences which play a part in human decisions.<br /><br />Why do killers kill? Many killers kill not because they consider themselves to be killers, but kill because their lives have led them to an increasing lack of respect for life, for the rights of other human beings to live unmolested and unharmed, for the necessity of any violent tendencies within oneself to be disciplined, and perhaps most importantly... for one not to confuse one's own feelings (considering oneself \\"sympathetic\\" and \\"sensitive\\") with genuine empathy, the genuine love for mankind that makes John Donne's famous sonnet with the oft-quoted phrase \\"No man is an island, entire unto himself\\" so stunningly apposite and powerfully true.<br /><br />The two killers whose acts brought murder into a quiet Kansas town became the raison d'être for Truman Capote's new work. Previously, his writing had included lighter pieces as \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" - which is not exactly lacking in darker emotions and complexity, but is more geared towards a serio-romantic tradition. There was nothing romantic in the new book Truman Capote had in mind... the now-famous \\"In Cold Blood\\".<br /><br />This film is about the creation of that book and the nature and character of Truman Capote, increasingly revealed throughout the course of the film as the book and the interviews its writing entailed become all-consuming to him.<br /><br />Capote himself is depicted with brutal honesty - his self-centredness, his egocentric desire to be the centre of attention, his callousness in the face of the desperation desire to live, and to be understood, on the part of the two killers, his uninterest even in the success of his friend Harper Lee in the wake of the publishing of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", and his almost unbelievably expressed desire to have \\"it\\" over with (\\"it\\" being the execution of the two killers).<br /><br />The complexity of this film is remarkably well done. It's beautifully paced, subtle and powerful - I note that some reviewers are dissatisfied with the film on the basis of its being too slow and too thoughtful, too lost in the moment. Perhaps to some viewers, accustomed to films in which hectic car chases follow one upon the other, and accustomed to reading the novels of Matthew Reilly, the film truly MAY be too slow for their liking. I can only say it worked beautifully for me. I was gripped by the story and its chilling unfolding from beginning to end.<br /><br />Capote's relationship with one of the killers - Perry Smith - is especially important. He is accused by his lover Jack of being in love with Perry, but also of using him. Capote is unable to grasp how both of these things could be true - but in the sense of \\"love\\" as understood by Capote's set, there is no difficulty.<br /><br />Perry Smith is a handsome young man, articulate, apparently sensitive, deeply aware of how he's perceived by others, craving respect and understanding. His diaries reveal that he fantasised about being admired by others - note his \\"If called upon to make a speech\\" entry. The murders of the father, mother, son and daughter were not committed out of hatred, desperation, necessity... and this is chilling. The line that divides us from monstrous deeds can be crossed at any moment by a decision or a reaction that takes less than the blink of an eye. And it is in Perry Smith's life that the film shows hints of what led to the murders - bit by bit, Perry Smith descended into increasingly antisocial activity, until finally, the man he'd tied up and was badgering for information on money in the house looked at him with terror. Looked at him with terror... and Perry Smith cut his throat.<br /><br />There WAS no reason. The internal callousness of this young man, who in many ways was sensitive and thoughtful, simplyled to a knee-jerk act - and having committed the first murder, Perry Smith followed through with the other three murders almost as though in a trance.<br /><br />Was he mentally ill? No. Had he been driven to these murders? No. Did he gain anything by murdering? No. There is such a thin wall between acceptable behaviour and monstrous behaviour - and even the committer of the deed cannot explain why he did what he did. He looks at himself and sees, not a murderer, but a man tormented by having DONE something he cannot understand.<br /><br />Drawn into an attraction towards Perry Smith, and yet separate from Smith's emotions by his own insulating case of egocentricity, Capote clearly extracted as much information from the prisoner as he could. It is based upon this intimate understanding that the true chills of the \\"In Cold Blood\\" title of the book makes its most powerful appeal.<br /><br />But in this film \\"Capote\\", the coldness is uncannily apt with respect to Capote's own behaviour and emotions. He desperately wishes for the execution to be over, so that at last he can finish his book. The book MUST end with the finality of that execution - every stay of execution is like a deliberate affront to him, a deliberate attempt to torment him. His masterpiece must be published - this is the pivotal thought in Capote's mind.<br /><br />The cinematography is wonderfully done in this film. The directing - magnificent. I loved the pace of the film. And the acting... is so good that one forgets one is watching actors, not the real people.<br /><br />Having seen the film, I'm ordering the DVD. I can't say it's a \\"feel good\\" film - I can say it is powerful and thought-provoking, and the friend with whom I saw the film and I have found it richly working in our minds so that we have discussed it in depth.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.ghtful, simply led to a knee-jerk act - and having committed the first murder, Perry Smith followed through with the other three murders almost as though in a trance. <br /> <br />Was he mentally ill?

B000E41MS6|5.0|Having barely seen an episode or two on PBS in my youth, I really got into the series after seeing the 1997 US TV movie. I quickly snatched up every VHS tape, and found every other missing episode and unreleased story on bootleg videos, to obsessively have every inch of existing Doctor Who known to man. I preferred Jon Pertwee's Doc the best, with Troughton and T. Baker next. No need to get into the original classic series, so on with the new one.    Right from the start, I really enjoy Eccleston's portrayal of the Doctor. It seems he really did his homework and seems to have found just the right combination of wit and intellect that made so many previous doctors a success. His quick tongue seems to keep up to the fast new pace of the show. While the longer episode, vintage shows had more time for character development and interaction, in today's fast paced world of 32x fast forward speed DVD capability, you can't have 4 to 6 part episodes and expect to keep people's attention to that one storyline. It worked in the 70's, but certainly wouldn't work now.    Vintage Doctor Who always had great supporting casts and guest stars, and the new series is no different. Rose's boyfriend and mom keep up nicely to the pace and plotting of the show. Simon Callow gives a great performance as Charles Dickens in the series 3rd episode.    Episode 1, Rose, sweeps us back into the whirlwind world of Doctor Who that we all know and love. It seems like it nearly skipped a beat since 1989, with only the surroundings and special effects being updated. It also offers enough info to keep a new viewer interested.  'Rose' is very action packed, much more than most vintage Who stories, and I think it has to be in some way to cater to the thrill-a-minute new millenium that we are all now fully accustomed to.    I had seen some sneak preview photos of the Autons before the show aired, and I thought they looked a little awkward and feared they might come across a bit cheesy in live action, however they threw me for a loop after watching Rose, as they looked incredibly lifelike and menacing. Bravo for the special effects wizards who worked on them as they looked brilliant. A superb opening episode to bring us all back into Who!    Ep. 2 kept Eccleston's sharp tongue going, and flew us into an alien space station, complete with just about every new concoction of an alien species one can concoct. Actually, the oddest looking species was the human!! A murderous metallic set of spiders is unleashed on a group of interplanetary oglers, wanting to witness the last moments of Earth. The always fashionably-late-in-saving-the-day Doctor has to come to Rose and everyone else's rescue.    Ep. 3 takes us to familiar Who territory, a period piece on planet Earth. 1869 to be exact, and Charles Dickens is giving a Christmas Eve performance of A Christmas Carol that gets rudely interrupted by a gas powered, walking corpse. The sets and costumes are superb, and this 19th century Cardiff set story is a real treat.    Episodes 4 & 5 are the first two part storyline, which deals with the Slitheen aliens invading Parliament.  It features some hilarious moments when the Slitheen attempt to wear their \\"rubber suits\\" that impersonate humans.    Ep. 6 is what we've all been waiting for:  The Dalek episode.  But alas, it features only one, but that's all it takes for a very strong episode involving an American collector of the future, who happens to have found one remaining Dalek, but doesn't realize how dangerous it really is.  The Doctor, fully aware of Dalek aggression, has to step in and set things straight, with a little help from Rose.    Ep. 7, The Long Game, takes us into a satellite space station where people are not returning from certain floors of the station.     Ep. 8, one of the strongest and certainly the most emotional of the series, sees Rose wanting the Doctor to allow her to see the father she never knew, however she does something the Doctor would never do, andspecifically asks her not to do: interferes with time.      Episodes 9 & 10 is another two parter involves the Doctor and Rose in the middle of bomb ridden London circa 1941.  Captain Jack Harkness is introduced and becomes a rival hero character for the Doctor.    Ep. 11 involves the return of the Slitheen and their plan to destory Earth.      Ep. 12 features a great spoof of reality shows, with the Doctor stuck in the middle.  This episode also features the best cliffhanger of the new show: Rose is kidnapped by the Daleks and the Doctor defiantly proclaims \\"I'm gonna blow every last stinkin' one of ya out of the sky\\".  Something no previous doctor would have ever said, it's a now classic quote and very characteristic of the new Who era, and the new Doctor.      Episode 13, the final battle with the Daleks, is the culmination of startling sci-fi entertainment, and a fine arguement for being the best season in the show's long and storied history.  It extremely disappointing that Eccleston is not returning for Season 2. That is a shame, because his Doctor is extremely well played. Hopefully David Tennant can fill his shoes nicely, and I'm sure the writing will be just as strong as series 1.     These are going to be loaded with all the extras found in the UK release.  They initially released bare bones DVD's on Region 2, in 4 volumes, which is how I got them as I had to have each new Who right away, and I can't wait until May 1st, when I will have the first of season 2 in my hands!!  For now, US fans unable to play or get a hold of Region 2 discs, have the Sci-Fi Channel airings and this new set out in July!!
B000002UB6|5.0|this album is truly amazing, and probably my favorite. it's cool too because the Beatles were recording this live (like the old days, not much editing at all) and they actuallly broke up before its release. Phil Spector received the originally titled 'Get Back' tapes and edited it and released it a few months after the Beatles broke up  <br /> <br />this album has some amazing songs and of course a few sucky ones but you can't avoid that <br /> <br />1. Two of Us 8/10 <br />          A great song by Paul about Linda, a very nice acoustic sound <br /> <br />2. Dig a Pony 9/10 <br />          One of my favorites. This one is by John and he says he wrote it as he went along and I feel it is his views on various subjects such as the Rolling Stones, \\"I roll a stoney, well you can imitate everyone you know (The Stones released \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" soon after the very successful and psychedelic Sgt. Peppers) A very cool song <br /> <br />3. Across the Universe 10/10 <br />          One of the best songs ever written and my favorite on the album. It is also one of John's favorites. It's a trippy kind of song with beautiful words. He wrote this while studying under Maharishi. Also, the line \\"jai guru deva, om\\" means \\"give thanks to Guru Deva (Maharishi's mentor), om (you know the thing they say when they meditate it's hard to explain but really cool look it up) <br /> <br />4. I Me Mine 6/10  <br />         George's first song on the album. It's ok with nice lyrics and melody. He got the idea from watching an Austrian marching band on tv. <br /> <br />5. Dig it 2/10 <br />          Not really a song, more of a tribute to the phrase \\"dig it\\" which the Beatles liked to use at the time. (Originially going to be called \\"Can You Dig it\\") its a random compilation of 12 minutes of jam sessions. <br /> <br />6. Let it Be 10/10 <br />          Wow. Wow. Let it be are you kidding me one of the best songs ever written and in close contention with Across the Universe for myfavorite. This is an amazing one by Paul about a dream he had of his mother giving him advice in a dream. She was hit by a bus and killed ten years before. <br /> <br />7. Maggie Mae 4/10 <br />          A weak song, John was intent on having this song follow Let it Be because he thought it had christian references, and this song is about a hooker from Liverpool. kind of a boring song. <br /> <br />8. I've Got a Feeling 7/10 <br />          A great rock song, and the last one written by John and Paul together. It is a mix of a ballad by John called Everybody Had a Hard Year and a blues song by Paul called I've Got a Feeling. Both were unfinished songs and they were mixed together. <br /> <br />9. One After 909 4/10 <br />          This was written by John in 1959, and you can tell. It can hardly be considered rock, but John tried to get it on an album two or three times throughout his career, and he finally did. <br /> <br />10. The Long and Winding Road 8/10 <br />          Another great ballad by Paul. It's slow, but it has great lyrics and was one of three singles on the album to hit number 1 on the charts (Let it Be, The Long and Winding Road, and Get Back). <br /> <br />11. For You Blue 6/10 <br />          George's second addition to the album. This is not my style of music, as it is a blues song written to his wife Patti. It's still pretty good though. <br /> <br />12. Get Back 9/10 <br />          My third favorite on the album behind Across the Universe and Let it Be, an awesome rock song written as a political satire. It criticizes an immigration law passed in England. Also the original name of the album. <br /> <br />GENIUS. PROBABLY THE BEST BEATLES ALBUM YOU MUST BUY THIS YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH AN THEN SOME.  <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album hails as Madonna's best overall work to date.  I have been listening to her music since her hits in the 80's. I own many of her ablums including singles, soundtracks and greatest hits, but this album has a collection of deep, soulful, hard hitting songs that leave you affected as only great music can!  And even better, each song is a part of the previous and leads into the next--it has an effect that you are listening to the same song but you wouln't notice until the end.  My favorite tracks are 2, 10, and 11.  I'm very glad to have experienced this release.
B000AY807Q|5.0|Beautiful, emotional, life defining music and lyrics for Neil at a difficult time in his life facing the brain anurism surgery, the loss of his father, and the fact that his daughter has reached young adulthood and has moved out to go to college.
B000066C6Z|4.0|This is a hoot.  An undiscovered Val Kilmer effort as a rock star, years before he made \\"The Doors\\".  Look for Lucy Gutenberg's sweater glowing when she rejoins Kilmer near the end.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album is one of my recent favourites. Just good song after good song. The that i find so appealing about his music is that it is just natural and refreshing. Its one of those albums i find i can listen to anytime and any place. I am finding it hard to find decent music at the moment so this changed that pattern. There are elements of rock, blues, pop, funk etc. Two of my favourites are 'Your body is a wonderland' and 'neon'. The way he pieces songs and lyrics together is fantastic. His music consists of many different styles and thats what i think makes it so appealing to such a wide amount of people. I would definately recommend it.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Okay, I watched this last night and I have to say that Hostel is:A- by no means overhyped, B- not for everybody(especially kids), and C- IMO, the best horror movie I've seen in a long time. Without giving too much of the movie away, here's a synopsis. 3 guys, 2 americans and 1 from Iceland, are in Amsterdam looking to get high, laid, etc. They have a grand old time doing all this but get greedy and want more. So some guy tells them about a hostel in Bratislava where the women do anything you want. They go, meet girls, drink, smoke, and have sex, blah, blah, blah. Then, all of a sudden one comes up missing. Now it's investigation time(Quick Scoob, to the Mystery Machine!!!).<br /><br />Anyway, what happens from this point is something that we have all seen in movies such as Hard Target and Surviving the Game. This however, is extremely more brutal than both of those put together. For those unfamiliar with the mentioned movies, it pretty much goes like this......rich folks pay x amount of dough to be able to torture and kill people without any reprocussions.<br /><br />Hostel does take a little while for the goodies to start happening, but there is plenty to keep you occupied until then. If you don't mind the unGodly amount of nipplage(i loved it!!!). And once the nastiness starts...........Damn!<br /><br />Very visual (i.e. gory) film, but what I found even more f'd up was the audio in this movie. These people were awake while being tortured and the screams and pleas of the victims were ultra-unsettling.<br /><br />All said and done, Eli and Quentin did a kick ass job with this movie. Be warned, this is for those of us with strong stomachs and those of us who have a firm grip on reality. Not for kids and not for fans of The Grudge and The Ring(ooh those were soooooo scary). I love twisted horror and recommend Hostel to those who feel the same. I cannot wait to get my hands on the unrated version. I know there has to be some stuff that was left on the cutting room floor(no pun intended). Grow a pair and check it out. You might surprise yourself and like it.ed). Grow a pair and check it out. You might surprise yourself and like it.

0446677450|4.0|This book is not so much a how to, but rather more of a healthy attitude adjustment torwards money.  It has really motivated me to change my spending habits and my plans for the future.  It has also motivated me to purchase other books Robert Kiyosaki.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This film was wonderful to watch. There is a steady undercurrent of strong morality coupled with a deep concern for the environment. One of the best foreign films that I have seen to date. Nausicaa is inspiring and profound. Would recommend to anyone with a penchant for foreign films, or someone interested in Miyazaki's works. Perfect for children and adults!
B000E33VWW|2.0|\\"Capote\\" is one of those films where its so absorbed into its own world that it forgets there's an audience who wants to be entertained.  \\"Capote\\" is a film that repeatedly delves deeper into a mystery only to be met with unsatisfactory suspense.  \\"Capote\\" is the tale of a writer who acheived his greatest work at the cost of his own soul, while also being a tale that takes 2 wasted hours to tell it.  This chronicle of Truman Capote's research and creation of \\"In Cold Blood\\", his greatest and last novel, is similar to its title character in many ways...and that's not a compliment.  As you have probably guessed, I really don't like this movie. <br /> <br />I give all the praise possible to character actor-turned-star Philip Seymour Hoffman, who perfects the mannerisms and motivations of a heartless and cold writer.  Capote, as I gathered from this biopic, was a maniuplative bastard who knew how to write some good literature.  The way that this man could say the most hurtful things to another human being, while lying to them at the same time, is really interesting to watch.  I wouldn't have picked Hoffman to win the Oscar, but he has definitely given the best performance of his career! <br /> <br />What made this movie work so ineffectively for me was the pacing.  It's too patient and quiet.  I didn't want a musical score to undermine the hard-working actors, but there's no sense of progression or control.  The movie isn't all over the place with its plot or unfocused; instead, this is a rare film that is too into the moment.  Director Bennett Miller is interested in the current scene that plays, but misses the big picture.  Miller loves the relationship between Capote and the two Kansas killers, but he doesn't understand that the overall picture does not work because their conversations are increasingly vague and tedious.  Hoffman brilliantly portrays an author who descends into depression and self-destruction, but Miller only lets us onto that when the final act rolls around.  I felt some heartbreak when Capote cries, when Capote drinks, when Capote remains isolated and alone...but why couldn't Miller show us that a downfall was in progression?  Come to think of it, \\"Capote\\" finally has some life breathed into during the last half-hour.  That's a hell of a long wait for Bennett Miller to pull away from the puzzle pieces and show the completed picture. <br /> <br />\\"Capote\\" is not a mystery, it is not a tragedy, it is not a thriller, it is not a love story, and I wouldn't even call it a drama.  This film isn't much of anything: the supporting characters are underdeveloped, the emotion is lacking, the mood is too subtle, the pacing is too patient, and the well-spoken dialogue and well-acted scenes are let down by a poorly-written plot.  \\"Capote\\" is a dreary and dull story that only makes sense when it's over, and only captivates when it's too late.  \\"Capote\\" is not much of anything, which is a disappointing way to portray the origin of one of the greatest works in American literature.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck is what I'd consider a postmodernist, in that, all of his music is a sort of ode to something that came before.  In all of his older albums, Beck built his sound by sampling the sounds of music you'd heard before.  They were original and inventive whether he was delving into country, grunge or hip-hop, but there was a detachment to all of them.<br /><br />Not the case with Sea Change.  In a sense, the folksy style of this album will be familiar to you because Beck is doing what he does best -- taking what's familiar and making it his own.  However, this time he has his own perspective.<br /><br />It's an album dripping in melancholy, yes, but it's a cathardic act because by the end of the album he's expressed every aspect of the end of a relationship and the loss of love. This time around Beck's lyrics aren't just sonic window-dressing -- they are actual thoughts.<br /><br />I think I read somewhere that this was Beck's Blood on the Tracks and that is probably as good a comparison as you're going to get.  Both albums feature two great artists at the end of long relationships.  Both albums musical innovation with honest emotion.  Both albums are classic.

0679422714|5.0|This is a great book that outlines and describes a picture of recent Chinese history in a very stark and revealing manner.  It clearly shows that Mao was the biggest MONSTER of the 20th century! -- and that, is saying a LOT for one of the most bloodthirsty century in human history so far. <br /> <br />One should read it to learn about the level and depth of trauma and torture that Chinese society was subjected to by Mao.  This will also start the reader on the path of learning about the roots of modern Chinese pshyche.  This is especially important to do as Chinese prominence in the world increases.  Also, this is a good lesson on how a totally selfish and ruthless individual can control, rule and degrade Chinese people and society. <br /> <br />This is not a cheerful read, and at times it is quite difficult, because of the level of depravity and ruthlessness that Mao's regime had perpetrated.  Nevertheless, this is a very important, significant and innovative work that is a major contribution to study of modern Chinese history. <br /> <br />I would also like to thank the authors of the book for the original research, work and courage that it took to write and publish this biography of Mao.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I waited a very long time to watch this movie and then only did so at the urging of my local librarian who promised it would suprise me....and it did! <br /> <br />The story is wonderful, Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are fantastic, the child actors are perfect (not too cute or contrived) and Julie Christie is great in the role of the stern grandmother.  <br /> <br />To my surprise I both laughed and cried, many times, throughout this movie.  It's wonderful. <br /> <br />I am anxious to watch it again
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Unlocking her lips, the doors to her secret world Shakira offers listeners one of the most enjoyable hours in current discography. \\"Oral Fixation Vol.2\\", second part to her epic double release \\"Fijacion Oral\\"/\\"Oral Fixation\\" is easily the best album the Colombian superstar has released to date. <br />Smart, fast, creative, emotional and edgy at the same time, Shakira is more gutsy and confident than ever here. <br /> Labelling this as pop music is an extremely simplistic and frivolous approach because this is hardly conventional pop. How many pop artists have been as experimental and artistic as Shakira is here? A lot of the material here wouldn't sound out of place in a Tori Amos album (from her old good days, that is)and Shakira's thorough and powerful form of protest here (on songs like \\"Animal City\\" and \\"Timor\\")is deeply political and never put-on. Also, she knows how to talk about love, in ways few artsts can. She is as revealing and erotic as she wants to be, sounding light years ago from the sappy-or-crude dilemma of modern pop and much closer to Liz Phair than Britney. <br /> \\"How Do You Do?\\" a torrent of worry and doubt addressed to God is chillingly brilliant, powerful beyond belief. If her previous work (and the two translated songs from it here, \\"The Day and the Time\\" and \\"Something\\") was all about hooking up and reaching happiness, this is the opposite, an album on what happens after the happy ending, full of bitterness and irony. \\"Don't Bother\\" is a bitter (albeit addictive) meditation on the status of modern relationships, sung from the position of \\"the other woman\\". \\"Illegal\\", featuring Carlos Santana, is a typical but effective heartbreak ballad, but it's the theatrical rocker \\"Costume Makes the Clown\\" that drives the point home. \\"I'm taking the makeup off my face/before I forget my own features\\", she sings right before tearing her lover apart. \\"Dreams for Plans\\" is another of these tracks, describing the way time affects people and relationships. It is a heartwrenching elegie on disorientation, change and alienation, and Shakira's description is frighteningly accurate.   <br />Shakira alternates with surprising agilty between hunter and prey. On the sexy \\"Hey You\\", she challenges someone in every way, whereas the delicate ballad \\"Your Embrace\\" features a fragile Shakira craving for her loved one. <br /> Shakira has never done better than this, using her mouth to pray, express, cry, protest, kiss and speak freely. But judging from the power of her work on this album, we've seen nothing yet. <br />
0312995423|5.0|This book is a great book! From the moment I picked it up I couldn't put it down until I was done. Dan Brown, Author of The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons (Also a great book) and Deception Point, has shown again that he has the ability to truly hook me on a book. Dan Brown's style of writing is great; he can turn a complicated plot and lets everyone understand it. This book is in the classic Dan Brown style of switching characters that always makes you read the next chapter. <br />When you look at the cover of Digital Fortress its seems cryptic and confusing but I guess its true what they say you really cant judge a book by its cover. The truest sign of a great writer is when I am reading a book and I look at the clock to see it's two in the morning! Even if you don't like Dan Brown's specific style of writing this book is very different from The Da Vinci Code. As with all of Dan Brown's Novels he provides a truly brilliant blend of fact and fiction, this provides you with a sense that you are actually learning something from this novel. Who would of thought that I could be so interested while learning!  <br />Whether or not you like mystery or The Da Vinci Code this book has a bit for everyone from the math nerd to the curious sleuth, this is ultimately one of Dan Browns finest and a great book whether your looking for a quick read, a terrifying thriller or a cryptic mystery this book is for you. <br />

0740748475|5.0|I loved Calvin and Hobbes when I was in High School. A friend of mine would bring in the newspaper each day and I would borrow it just to read this comic adventure!<br /><br />I have never found any other comic to be so well written, thought out and just completely charming as this one. Many people over the years have tried to imitate it but have not even come close. The wild wagon rides, the great crazy dream sequences, teasing Susie, Rosalyn the babysitter, the transmogrifier and duplicator (all in one cardboard box!), Spaceman Spiff and so much more. Anyone can find a piece of themselves in Calvin and his adventures.<br /><br />Calvin was always pragmatic - and then there was Hobbes. He was calm, the great thinker, the voice of reason and sanity - and he did all wearing his great jams!<br /><br />Just writing this makes me remember how much I always enjoyed reading this classic (and I mean that in every sense of the word!) comic and how much it will always mean to me. It's definitely worth the time and money - you won't find anything else even close to its creativity and just plain genius. Thank you Bill Watterson!
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|While the A&E version is delighfully over the top, this P&P is darkly under the top. The main characters are too sweaty, too poor, and too coarse. I often wasn't sure if I was looking at servants or the gentry. Although historically accurate, dirt and sweat are more of a Dickens theme than an Austen. They don't accentuate the story, just make it more improbable. <br /> <br />Jane looked the part, the mother was an interesting interpretation of the character, the father bordered on senility, Lizzy came across as an average girl and Darcy had deadpan eyes that made me as bored watching him as he seemed to be with his part.   <br /> <br />If the A&E and this version of P&P were put on opposite ends of a spectrum, the ideal would be somewhere in between. As it stands, watch the A&E if you can spare the time and turn off this one after Darcy proposes and Lizzy accepts.
0887307280|5.0|I am almost finished reading The E-Myth Revisited and it has been a transforming experience for my small business. The principles author Michael Gerber illustrates through real-life stories and personal experience are so very practical and life-changing. Sometimes you'll wonder, \\"where is he going with this\\", and then BOOM, he'll tie it all together and it creates a light bulb moment, an ah-ha moment, whatever you wish to call it.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this goldmine of information to wanna-be entreprenuer's, beginning entrepreneur's, and established entrepreneur's. You'll discover that your business does not own you, you own your business and you have the power to structure it according to who you are and what you want your life to look like.<br /><br />Thank you Michael Gerber for the transforming power of systems!
B00005JOE8|5.0|This was a great movie for those of us who like are brains to work while and after you watch movies. For people who dont like to think dont watch the movie. This is the the best movie of the year so far. Watch V for Vendetta.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|This film seemed to be more of an overview. It focused more on his exploits and early life.<br /><br />In the film we see that he drank, smoked, did drugs, cheated on his wife and wore a lot of black clothing. More could have been done to show - OK he had his vices, he pulled himself together,created great music and here's how. Also we did not see anything about his later life and marriage to June Carter. Why was this completely left out and so much of the early problems shown?<br /><br />The acting in the film was great and the film is entertaining.  The writers had an opportunity to show that even though Johnny Cash had problems through out his life that he overcame them, moved on and even more. Instead they sold out and gave us sex, drugs (and in this case) Country Music.

B00000BKDZ|4.0|Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son (1988.), Iron Maiden's seventh studio album<br /><br />Throughout the 1980's, Iron Maiden were a band that were hard to match. Every one of their releases were great, whether it be the definitive metal album in 'The Number Of The Beast' or the monstrous epic that was 'Powerslave'. The band had led the way in influencing many a metal band and had also along the way built up a massive fan base. With the band's previous effort, 'Somewhere In Time', Maiden's progressive tendencies became much more apparent. The band began to experiment more and more with epic tunes as well as the usage of synths in their music. When Iron Maiden released 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son', their popularity couldn't have been greater and the album duly debuted at #1 in the album charts. 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son' is another of Iron Maiden's highly praised efforts and is also regarded as one of their more accessible works. So how well does this concept album work?<br /><br />Eventhough I wouldn't quite say this album is in the league of the band's earlier masterpieces such as 'Powerslave' or 'Number Of The Beast', there is no doubting this epic and greatly assured album succeeds on many levels. The album demonstrates the classic Maiden line up on top form, something which would not be seen for a long time after this album, as guitarist Adrian Smith would leave the band following the tour for the album. For a concept album, this album is remarkably accessible, as many fans have pointed out. Hit staples such as 'Can I Play With Madness' and 'The Evil That Men Do' are great tracks that succeed without consideration of the album's concept. All of the songs on the album are quite easy to get into, even if you don't get the album's concept. The concept of the album itself is built around a child born with mystical powers who is tempted by the good and the evil. The storyline works very well in the album - to date Maiden's only concept work! The other great success with this album is the integration of synths (played by Steve Harris and Adrian Smith) into Iron Maiden's heavy metal sound. The synths add a bright texture to the music but at the same time don't burden or cloud the band's metal sound. The work is distinctly Iron Maiden, through and through.<br /><br />Not too long ago, the Iron Maiden catalogue got totally remastered and improved. Hence the 1998 remasters are the way to go. The remaster job is great and all of the songs shine through with no sound glitches but also the recent version features and excellent accompanying booklet. The CD itself also has an enchanced multimedia section and you can view video footage of the 'Can I Play With Madness' and 'The Evil That Men Do' songs from your PC.<br /><br />Iron Maiden kick off their great concept album with 'Moonchild'. A spoken opening from Bruce Dickenson sets the scene for the album, before the synth heavy riffs kick in. This is a great opening track, and one of the best songs on the album. The song has a great riff and is really well underpinned by an insanely fast bass line played by Steve Harris. The song also has a really atmospheric bridge section with great vocals from Dickenson. 'Infinite Dreams' follows; a very underrated Maiden track. This song incorporates softer, synth filled passages which are contrasted well with heavier sections. The song fades out quite cleverly into 'Can I Play With Madness', one of Maiden's more famous songs. A great song, perhaps just a little overrated. Still it is really catchy, has a great chorus and keeps the album theme running very well. 'The Evil That Men Do' follows and what a track this is. The song has darker undertones and this is reflected in Dickenson's snarling and biting vocals. Again, a song with a great chorus line, which made it an instant successful single.<br /><br />The second half of the album gets underway with the title track epic. This is a phenominal song filled with differently styled sections. The chorus is grand and strong and the interlude is soft but atmospheric and captivating. However, the song get's really special towards the end where the band let rip racing guitar lines, solos and great synth effects. 'The Prophecy' follows, a weaker track but still good. The opening is great however the following call and response styled verses get a little repetitive. Still, the song has a grand feel to it. 'The Clairvoyant' follows; a great progressive song. The bass opening is entrancing before the guitars steadily build to a great climax. Bruce Dickenson gives an inspired performance throughout over some timeless guitar riffs. Next, to finish the album is 'Only The Good Die Young'. This song is an OK closer, although the band have done much better and there are certainly plenty more superior songs on this album. The guitar work is great but you can't help but feel the song could develop a little more. The song closes with another Bruce Dickenson spoken passage.<br /><br />So there you have it, Iron Maiden's concept album. 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son' is a awesome album which for me only marginally falls short of being a masterpiece due to a couple of average tracks. This aside though, this album has some thrilling stuff and also is a great mark of Iron Maiden's development as a band into progressive territory. Any fan of the band should definitely own this one. This is also a very accessible album and is one that even more casual fans of the band should fully appreciate. All in all 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son' is the final mark of the great innovative heavy metal that Iron Maiden put out in the 1980's.<br /><br />MY RATING: 8/10e is soft but atmospheric and captivating. However, the song get's really special towards the end where the band let rip racing guitar lines, solos and great synth effects. 'The Prophecy' follows, a weaker track but still good.

B000002KXV|5.0|Although I was around in the 70s, I was not fully aware of Donald Fagen/Steely Dan until I heard Donald Fagen's \\"Nightfly\\" in the 80s.  I was instantly impressed because I had never heard music quite like this.  Fagen has such a unique style that is unmistakenly identifiable in all his music and this album's music and lyrics are so captivating because of the mood that it creates....that of a time so long ago (the 1950's).  From the time that I first heard this album until now, I have collected every Fagen/Dan piece of music that I could possibly get my hands on.  This is a truly great album and I recommend it to anyone who loves great music, particulary Steely Dan Music. <br /> <br />P.S.....I love Donald Fagen
B00005JGAB|5.0|The band that brought punk rock to this world. The Ramones deserve ALOT and lots of credit for what they did. This is the album that started it all. All the songs are absolutely great, especially the first three songs. Without this album and band, there wouldn't be The Sex Pistols, The Clash, and other future punk bands like Green Day(Which they are one of my favorite punk bands). And also, don't listen to that moron below me who says that The Ramones are HEAVY METAL???? HAHAHAHAHAHA, what a moron. So if you have left over money, spend it on this album, it is worth your money.
B000063DI9|4.0|Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son (1988.), Iron Maiden's seventh studio album<br /><br />Throughout the 1980's, Iron Maiden were a band that were hard to match. Every one of their releases were great, whether it be the definitive metal album in 'The Number Of The Beast' or the monstrous epic that was 'Powerslave'. The band had led the way in influencing many a metal band and had also along the way built up a massive fan base. With the band's previous effort, 'Somewhere In Time', Maiden's progressive tendencies became much more apparent. The band began to experiment more and more with epic tunes as well as the usage of synths in their music. When Iron Maiden released 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son', their popularity couldn't have been greater and the album duly debuted at #1 in the album charts. 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son' is another of Iron Maiden's highly praised efforts and is also regarded as one of their more accessible works. So how well does this concept album work?<br /><br />Eventhough I wouldn't quite say this album is in the league of the band's earlier masterpieces such as 'Powerslave' or 'Number Of The Beast', there is no doubting this epic and greatly assured album succeeds on many levels. The album demonstrates the classic Maiden line up on top form, something which would not be seen for a long time after this album, as guitarist Adrian Smith would leave the band following the tour for the album. For a concept album, this album is remarkably accessible, as many fans have pointed out. Hit staples such as 'Can I Play With Madness' and 'The Evil That Men Do' are great tracks that succeed without consideration of the album's concept. All of the songs on the album are quite easy to get into, even if you don't get the album's concept. The concept of the album itself is built around a child born with mystical powers who is tempted by the good and the evil. The storyline works very well in the album - to date Maiden's only concept work! The other great success with this album is the integration of synths (played by Steve Harris and Adrian Smith) into Iron Maiden's heavy metal sound. The synths add a bright texture to the music but at the same time don't burden or cloud the band's metal sound. The work is distinctly Iron Maiden, through and through.<br /><br />Not too long ago, the Iron Maiden catalogue got totally remastered and improved. Hence the 1998 remasters are the way to go. The remaster job is great and all of the songs shine through with no sound glitches but also the recent version features and excellent accompanying booklet. The CD itself also has an enchanced multimedia section and you can view video footage of the 'Can I Play With Madness' and 'The Evil That Men Do' songs from your PC.<br /><br />Iron Maiden kick off their great concept album with 'Moonchild'. A spoken opening from Bruce Dickenson sets the scene for the album, before the synth heavy riffs kick in. This is a great opening track, and one of the best songs on the album. The song has a great riff and is really well underpinned by an insanely fast bass line played by Steve Harris. The song also has a really atmospheric bridge section with great vocals from Dickenson. 'Infinite Dreams' follows; a very underrated Maiden track. This song incorporates softer, synth filled passages which are contrasted well with heavier sections. The song fades out quite cleverly into 'Can I Play With Madness', one of Maiden's more famous songs. A great song, perhaps just a little overrated. Still it is really catchy, has a great chorus and keeps the album theme running very well. 'The Evil That Men Do' follows and what a track this is. The song has darker undertones and this is reflected in Dickenson's snarling and biting vocals. Again, a song with a great chorus line, which made it an instant successful single.<br /><br />The second half of the album gets underway with the title track epic. This is a phenominal song filled with differently styled sections. The chorus is grand and strong and the interlude is soft but atmospheric and captivating. However, the song get's really special towards the end where the band let rip racing guitar lines, solos and great synth effects. 'The Prophecy' follows, a weaker track but still good. The opening is great however the following call and response styled verses get a little repetitive. Still, the song has a grand feel to it. 'The Clairvoyant' follows; a great progressive song. The bass opening is entrancing before the guitars steadily build to a great climax. Bruce Dickenson gives an inspired performance throughout over some timeless guitar riffs. Next, to finish the album is 'Only The Good Die Young'. This song is an OK closer, although the band have done much better and there are certainly plenty more superior songs on this album. The guitar work is great but you can't help but feel the song could develop a little more. The song closes with another Bruce Dickenson spoken passage.<br /><br />So there you have it, Iron Maiden's concept album. 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son' is a awesome album which for me only marginally falls short of being a masterpiece due to a couple of average tracks. This aside though, this album has some thrilling stuff and also is a great mark of Iron Maiden's development as a band into progressive territory. Any fan of the band should definitely own this one. This is also a very accessible album and is one that even more casual fans of the band should fully appreciate. All in all 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son' is the final mark of the great innovative heavy metal that Iron Maiden put out in the 1980's.<br /><br />MY RATING: 8/10soft but atmospheric and captivating.

0307276902|2.0|I think it is remarkable that frey save himself from his destructive self. But why would he trashed the 12-step programme as sissy when he himself was helped by the programme. What an ungrateful prick. Just because he wants to make his life seem more dramatic so that he can sell a few more books doesn't give him the right to trash the  programmes that try to help so many alcoholics. Moreover, 12-step had helped so many others and give many people a new lease on life which frey himself is never capable of in this of his self-centered-i'm-so-talented lifetime.  <br /> <br />As flair as his writting can be, i have no respect for this guy as a memoir writer or a person. He may be a \\"tragic hero\\" that he perceived to have single-handedly save himself but he is more of a ungrateful hypocrite who bears no regard to the people and programme that had helped him through the darkest period of his life. It is one thing to tell harmless white lies every now and then but to trash the programme which had gave you a hand at the lowest point of your life is just WRONG and ungrateful and hurtful.  <br />  <br />And putting on an image as the-tough-guy-who-rescue-himself-from-his-own-path-towards-destruction, <br />i think frey is more of a regular hypocrite who have complete disregard for others that had struggled through the 12-step and came in sober. If it were up to me, i rather use his book as log to keep the fireplace burning. Maybe that will keep some  people who are shivering from alcohol withdrawal warm!!!
B00005JO9J|5.0|This show has redefined Sunday night television and sucked me into the drama like no other show in a long time.  Finally, a show that caters to twenty-somethings!  This show has a way of creating a feeling of attachment to these characters... you really do care about them on a more personal level.  I am so happy with my purchase.  The shows keep getting better and better!  I highly recommend this show to anyone - it is much more than just another medical drama.  It's funny and clever!  I love it!
B0006399FS|5.0|When I first heard this CD I HATED it! But now, it's one of my favourite U2 c.d's after Unforgettable Fire.  <br />The accompyaning DVD is unintentionally hilarious (thanks to Adam Clayton, who should have been in Spinal Tap) The Edge and Bono do an excellent cover of Vertigo with a mandolin (I think.) <br /> <br />I reccomend this C.D. Give it a chance, it's really good.
0066620996|5.0|It doesn't matter what you do for a living, this book is for you.  It's easily one of the best three books I've ever read, hands down.
B000021YQV|1.0|I bought this when it came out because of all the hype, I really hadn't heard them on the radio as yet. After one listen I was disappointed..........and two listens I was pissed........after 3 listens I wanted my money back. The lead singer has got one of the worst, off key voices I've ever heard. The instrumentation is far superior over the vocals. I don't get why this band is so popular but to each his own.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|If you loved them from the albums in the 60's, always wished you had the chance to see them in all their glory. This is a timeless classic, and a chance to catch a glimpse of the past. No, it's not the same, and after all these years I would be disapointed if it was. They all bring their pasts with them, but when they get on a roll it's like nothing changed. Personally, I love 'Badge' it's short - none of the extended jams elsewhere on the disc-, but it seems all at once to be new, old, timeless, and beautiful.  It is what it was, a chance for 3 guys to play music they loved, and share it with an audience. Now they reunite to share the love again, and I could not be more happy!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera tells the story of a disfigured genius hiding from the world behind a mask living in the cellar of an 1870 paris opera house, when he falls in love with the beautiful orphaned sorprano singer Christine Deaa, he will enter into a new world filled with happiness, hatred, and disaster. Prepared to be swept away into a world of love, tragedy and revenge known as the phantom of the opera.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|First, what is wrong with all of you? This is the most spectacular Daft album ever... It's simply dextaciluar!! and thats being mild... I love this album, nothing embodies the final and benevolent conclusion of the almighty Daft, and I hope this is not the final, please, please, let it be not. But something tells me it might be... since as far as I can remember, when all the other groups over the years start talking (or expressing) about the human condition, they magically disband into thin air. Like mighty, mighty sages gone into the very soul of the unborn.
0345457684|5.0|Let me point out right from the start that have read sci-fi most of my life, but I do not closely follow the genre of sci-fi that many people have put this book into, cyberpunk, call it what you will.  That said I can not really compare it, nor do I care to.  This an entertaining read with some great ideas in it to keep you thinking.  Plus, it's not straight up sci-fi, it's a crime drama too.   <br /> <br />The idea of storing ones memory and even personality in a microchip is not new, but I love what author Richard Morgan does with it.  What if your body is destroyed but you have enough money to buy another body and have your chip, or your `stack' as Morgan calls it, placed in a new body or even a clone of yourself?  What if you have enough money to do this indefinitely and find yourself hundreds of years old?  What is life like, marriage, your sex drive?  Morgan touches on some of these though he really leaves it up to the reader to do any of the deep thought.  His characters are too busy carrying out their deceptive plans and trying to find ways to permanently kill each other, referred to as `Real Death', to get too philosophical.  And that is just fine as the story moves along at an exciting pace that left me wanting more.   <br /> <br />The protagonist, Takeshi Kovacs, is a man of experience when it comes to dying and being reborn.  He was a professional at it as a member of a highly trained corps of fighters.  Which of course begs the question, how do they ever finish a war?  But that is another book.  For now, Kovacs is forced into the employ of a millennia old man who thinks he was murdered and wants to capture the culprit.  Kovacs is compelled to gumshoe it for this wealthy man or face having his stack put back into storage.  Apparently used in place of prison, stack storage takes up a lot less space than those prisons we have now and frees up a lot of bodies for use by others.  And by others I mean Kovacs and his enemies who shoot, burn and blow up a lot of them throughout the story.   <br /> <br />Morgan does a nice job of creating a lot of history behind Kovacs and in turn allows Morgan to create a lot of threads to weave into this story, giving Kovacs depth.  The society here on Earth is quite interesting as well and Morgan does take some time to describe in detail his vision of the future.  And it ain't pretty being easy.  The sex trade reaps the benefits of disposable bodies, clones and custom genetic engineering.  Sometimes the scene shifts are a little too abrupt and there are a lot of characters to keep track of, but it all comes together for a flashy and satisfying ending <br />
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I think that this was very very good in most ways. The singing was very good as were the special effects, but I really don't like Raoul and Christine. Raoul is a total fakeout stupid person and Christine has one expression: Sleepy/Crazy. She appears to be: a) too tired to continue acting, b) in love with the Phantom, or c) extremely bored. Other than that, it was a very good movie overall.
0446677450|4.0|This book should be required reading for high school students.  The stories and anecdotes Mr. Kiyosaki uses in this book bring across his ideas very well.  Most people don't learn these simple concepts early enough in life when they can be of the most benefit.   <br /> <br />That being said, the concepts that Mr. Kiyosaki mentions are not new.  The idea of investing your income in assets that, in turn, provide additional income is key to building wealth and it's been around since the industrial revolution.  Unfortunately, most people choose to spend their income on 'doodads', as Mr. Kiyosaki refers to them, even going into debt to pay for them.  The end result is ongoing debt, and a paycheck-to-paycheck existence.  Mr. Kiyosaki reiterates this point very well. <br /> <br />I don't agree with the subtle recommendation that you quit your \\"day job\\" and go into business for yourself.  While being in business for yourself has advantages, your 'day job' can, and should, provide the financial 'fuel' to get your business or investments off the ground.  Going into a side business while keeping your current job is another option.   <br /> <br />On the whole, it's a good read, especially for those just starting out in life.
0156027321|1.0|I received Life of Pi for my birthday and jumped right in, reading it in two days.  I had heard good things about it so I kept reading until the end.  I would catagorize Life of Pi as a fantasy adventure which is not my typical read.  The book is well written and literate but the plot is very weak.  Given the same outline of events a lot more could have been done with the story.  The fact that the plot was totally implausible made the read very painful.  I stuck with it so could discuss it with others.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Rod Stewart just seems to get better.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Ok I bought this on a whim.  I hadn't heard any of the track but I was like hey it's Prince.  I am so glad that I did.  This CD is like that.  It flows from beginning to end and it gets your head bobbin'.  From the beats you can tell how talented Prince.  I could just listen to the instrumental version of the CD  You can listen to it over and over again.  The tracks I like the most are Black Sweat, Incense and Candles, Beautiful, Loved & Blessed, and The Dance.  I definitely recommend this CD.
B000089RV6|5.0|BACK IN BLACK is the best AC/DC album from the Brian Johnson era along with RAZORS EDGE and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK.This terrific album features huge hits like HELLS BELLS,YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG and the awes title track.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000002UAO|4.0|Since I'm American I was introduced to the the US version of Rubber Soul. Although The Beatles actually wanted these songs on this album, I \\"personally\\" find the US version vastly superior (due to the song mix). I bought this album and burned my own US Version using other Beatles Albums which contained the necessary songs and omitted whatever was on the UK version that was not on the US version (these songs are good, btw). Not a problem. Not sure why they don't have a US version since many prefer that one.

B0002DKCMG|3.0|Although this movie doesn't beat the old \\"European Vacation\\", it still has a couple of scenes that had me falling out of my chair laughing.  I definitely recommend it as a solid comedy.
B000BKDOB6|3.0|Horses is one of the seminal \\"albums\\" from my youth. I loved it, and played it a lot, usually alone, since my peers didn't have the same reaction to it. One of my all-time, core favorites. For some reason, I've never replaced my original vinyl with a CD. When I saw the remastered version, I had to have it. I wished I could have gone to the 2005 concert, so thought I'd really enjoy the double CD with the live version. Reviews here and on iTunes talked of how amazing the live version was, and reinforced my thoughts, so I went for the double CD. Listening to the studio version was just as fantastic as remembered. Not at all faded by time. Unfortunately, I can't say that about the live version. I don't like the live version. At all. I feel a weird sense of disloyalty saying that, enough that I didn't want to admit it at first. I kept at it, with repeated listenings, hoping I'd warm to the differences. But...no. I'm forced to say that I much prefer the studio version. No, worse than that, I dislike the live version. So much so, that I no longer have the live versions on my iPod. Maybe it's that effect of liking whatever version of a song you hear first, or possibly, since this was such a central album in my formative years, the original sound has too much meaning for me to like anything else. Whatever. I would have been better served by the single CD version. Since that makes me feel older and more inflexible than I want to believe I am, I wish I hadn't bought it. Then, my reminisces wouldn't have any negative tinge. Oh well. I'll live. But, save yourself. The studio version is 5+ stars excellent. Buy it.

0977326403|5.0|Many of us who work in the social sector-in my case the United Methodist Church-were encouraged and inspired by Jim Collins book Good to Great.  We worked to adapt the methodology to our work, but some parts didn't fit.  Collins realized from the feedback his work was getting that a large number of his readers needed more specific research into their context.  This monograph is a first installment in addressing our need.<br /><br />The underlying principle of the book is that we don't need to impose the language of business on the social sector, but develop a language of greatness.  He does this by focusing on five issues that surfaced during the Good to Great research and tweaking them for a different mission and context.  They are:<br /><br />1.  Defining Great-How do we calibrate success without business metrics?<br /><br />2.  Level 5 Leadership-Getting things done within a diffuse power structure<br /><br />3.  First Who-Getting the right people on the bus within social sector constraints<br /><br />4.  The Hedgehog Concept-Rethinking the economic engine without a profit motive<br /><br />5.  Turning the Flywheel-Building momentum by building the brand.<br /><br />The monograph is a first look at applying these five good to great concepts to the social sector.  I found it to be exciting, invigorating and one of the best things I've read in a long time.  I think this is essential for non-profit leaders-especially church leaders-who want to build great organizations and build accountability within the constraints of structures that we can't change.
0783222149|5.0|This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The suspense and action is a must-see, and the scenery is absolutely beautiful.  The way their ride through the rapids was filmed is fantastic!
B000E33VWW|3.0|There's an old joke that goes \\"I saw \\"The Buddy Holly Story\\" and \\"La Bamba\\" on a double bill the other night, but I ended up demanding a refund, you wanna know why? THEY BOTH HAD THE SAME ENDING!\\" (Insert rimshot here). There don't seem to be too many reviewers who have addressed this issue (maybe I'm just showing my age), but anyone who has already seen Richard Brooks' 1967 theatrical treatment of Truman Capote's true crime masterwork is bound to watch \\"Capote\\" with more than a little sense of deja vu. Yes, I know we are talking apples and oranges thematically-\\"In Cold Blood\\" was a psychological study of the killers, \\"Capote\\" is a psycological study of thier biographer. Still, \\"Capote\\" begs comparisons (especially when its final shots are basically a frame-by-frame recreation of \\"In Cold Blood\\"'s closing scene.) If you can get past that (I guess I couldn't), there are excellent performances here (Phillip Seymour Hoffman's immersion into character is spooky good as always), but they are somewhat tempered by the film's deliberate, glacial pacing. Not that I was expecting car chases, but in my viewing experience, movies that attempt to dissect the writer's mind tend to run into a bit of trouble in the narrative department (witness \\"Henry and June\\", \\"Naked Lunch\\", \\"Adaptation\\", \\"Barton Fink\\"). Somewhat absorbing, but not compelling enough for repeated viewings. A guarded recommendation.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I was going to give this CD a 4, but I learned my lesson with The Rainbow Children. I realized after a couple of hearings; songs I thought I did not like grew on me. So I'll go ahead and upgrade 3121 from 4 to 5 right now.  I purchased and listened to it 2x today. <br /> <br />So - It's really, really good. It's true Prince.  He has a way of taking old school and making it sound new.  I love the way he samples, so to speak, from himself.  His music is like one huge color palette; he grabs a little from here and there and suddenly a new creation, with familiar colors and tones.   <br /> <br />3121 - Funky, opening sounds like Mary J. Blidge's \\"Love @1st Sight\\"   <br />Lolita - Pop, I agree with others, it's like a clean Soft and Wet for 2006. <br />By the way I love the clean, happy, up lifting Prince. <br />TAC - Mellow, feels like \\"And God Created Woman\\" - Growing on me, Love the video. George Benson feel to the guitar arrangement. <br />Black Sweat - Funky, Did not like at first, Growing on me. <br />Incense and Candles - R&B, lovely. Seductive - The appropriate art image in the booklet. <br />Love- Techno/Funk - perfect for a movie soundtrack <br />Satisfied - Bluesy - Nice. Loved it from when he sang it on the Vanguard Awards. <br />Fury - Rock, Like \\"Baby Knows\\" mixed with \\"Beautiful Strange\\" <br />The Word - WOW - The opening horns, the sentiment, just makes you want to drop the top and circle the beltway.  I could listen to this over and over. Tears to my eyes. <br />BLAB - Good R&B, would like to hear a Jill Scott or something on the vocal. <br />The Dance - A little disappointing after the dramatic opening. Was expecting something darker, more mysterious. It's growing on me, but too mellow.  It's a good companion to TAC. I could see this video completing TAC. <br />Get on The Boat - James Brown inspired - Love it - up lifting, sounds like \\"Prettyman\\" from Rave. <br /> <br />Okay - Where's the hidden track?????? <br /> <br />Lastly - Prince's beliefs have made his music better. I can't imagine what would have happen if he just continued with the sex, shock, cursing stuff at this age.  Hopefully he stays faithful, happy, beautiful, loved and blessed. <br />
B000005HBI|5.0|Repeatedly unexpected.  Spare, care-ful arrangements, each specifically formulated for each song, each matching her rich, dark alto.  First and foremost, serious jazz, but also something entirely different, reflecting an eclectic song choice (e.g., Robert Johnson, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Ann Peebles, herself).  Sometimes a primal awareness, but mainly a remarkable artistic sensibility.  She DEMANDS attention, completely remaking even old favorites into something totally new.  S:  tr 2-Come on in my kitchen; tr 4-Children of the night, tr 5-Hellhound on my trail; tr 7-Sankofa; tr 10-Tupelo honey.
B00003003R|4.0|I generaly don't care for live albums but I really like this one. It's full of good energy from the audience and good music. The songs don't follow a timeline from their early days to their later ones so one song will be from their earlier days and it will have a raw sound to it then the next song will be from a later concert and it will have back up singers, horns and the piano. I like that aspect of this album but it might bother some listeners. Whether you're a casual fan like me or a die hard fan you should get this album.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|I could rant about a lot of things in Troy: when I originally saw it I wrote a four page rant in which I detailed everything they got wrong, even things as simplistic as the ancient Greek burial ritual.  And now I could list even more since I've studied early civilizations a bit and know that the Iliad would have taken place during the Greek Dark Ages and thus the battle tactics shown were incredibly anachronistic.  But I think that a review on what bothered me the most about the movie will suffice. <br /> <br />Menelaus has always been my favorite Iliad character: perhaps my favorite mortal character in all of Greek mythology.  When I heard about Troy coming out, I was excited.  Then I saw the casting.  The minute I saw Brendan Gleeson's face peering back at me, I knew Menelaus was going to be villainized.   <br /> <br />Okay, it is a sign of bad writing when a movie needs to villainize the second guy in a love triangle in order to make the audience root for the other one.  Think Cal in Titanic.  Troy's portrayal of Menelaus makes Cal look like Prince Charming.  At least he was good-looking.  Menelaus, originally a younger, handsome warrior whom Helen CHOSE TO MARRY out of FIFTY suitors was warped into an old, brutish jerk who, just to ensure the audience felt no sympathy for him, was a philanderer as well.  And then the audience is made to think that poor Helen was the child bride of this old man.  Just so we think that Paris, played by Orlando Bloom with all of the depth and charisma of a noodle, is the love of her life.  And not the honorable man she chose to marry. <br /> <br />Troy doesn't even stop there.  It villainizes all of the Greeks, particularly Agamemnon, who apparently isn't shown as enough of a jerk in the myths when he sacrifices his daughter.  No, no, now he has to be a megalomaniacal oaf who hurt the poor Trojans for no reason.  Ignoring the real reasons the Greeks invaded Troy.  Yeah... Oath of Tyndareus, anyone?  Curse of the House of Atreus, anyone?  Pfft. <br /> <br />And then Troy gets even better by making HECTOR think Menelaus is a lousy jerk and his brother is wonderful!  When in the Iliad it's the total opposite.  He even refers to Menelaus as \\"the honorable man who you wronged.\\"  Hector kills Menelaus for Paris in the movie.  Hector would NEVER fight his brother's battles for him.  He hated his brother. <br /> <br />In the myths, Helen ends up missing her husband and even yells at Aphrodite for having enchanted her.  Not so in Troy; in Troy, she genuinely loves Paris!  Gag me.  Seriously.  Why does she love Paris, because he's young and hot?  Because he's a disgusting person, and a coward. <br /> <br />See, it's not poor Menelaus's fault that Troy's writers suck.  And that Helen and Paris were such a terrible couple, with such bad chemistry, that the writers needed to make Helen's husband a worse alternative.  Yes, I am aware that he is not real, but is it not a crime to defile a great literary character?  I will never forgive Troy for what it did.
B000002OX7|5.0|This is an amazing album that anyone should own. On this album The Who doesn't have a very poppy tune as they did in their earlier work and you get more acoustic guitars,synths and piano which what helps make this album good. Another way to know how good this album is that most of their songs played on the radio come from this album. The raw power of this guys from their guitars, drums, vocals and everything else is very energenic and inspiring. Now I don't own this disc but I own the tape so I can't really comment on the extra songs but I'm sure they're good. I hope that one day I will actually go out and buy this cd which is something you should be doing right now.    I finally got this cd and I must say I was even more blown away by it than I was with the tape. The power of this cd is just awesome and I fell in love with it all over again. The song pure and easy is a bit different from the original and the extra songs are full of great rock energy which just add to this already great album. The song water is live and you also get the original version of behind blue.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This is Robin Williams at some of his best.  Thought provoking, soothing, and at times even disturbing, are some of the experiences I've had each time (3) I've watched this movie.  It is an excellent portrayal of the idea that Heaven is a wonderful place where we exert tremendous influence.  It also poignantly captures the notion that we can create our own hells.  I highly recommend it to you.
B000093BDX|4.0|I'm only a casual fan so I decided to buy this best of cd which contains 30 songs. Most of the songs are pretty good and some of them get on my nerves but for the most part this cd is enjoyable. The music is mostly about surfin' and hangin' out at a Southern Californian beach and it will make you feel like you were at the beach having a good time with them. So if you're only a casual fan or a new fan then I would suggest that you get this disc. I saw this cd at wal-mart and it came with a dvd with some concert footage but the dvd doesn't come with this one.
6305128952|1.0|I dont know how many people are aware of this but Betty Buckley played the girlfriend of Robert Redford's character. This was during her run on Broadway of Sunset Boulevard.  Because of the length of the film, all her scenes were cut. I would love to see the deleted scenes of those on a DVD. Then maybe I would buy it.
B00000JNO2|4.0|This album has a country sound to a lot of their songs which I really enjoyed. Some of the more rockin' songs are Gimme back my bullets and double trouble. I got the same old blues is a slower song with a nice groove to it and a harmonica solo. Some of the songs have female vocals, like on double trouble, which are enjoyable. If you want to hear a more country sound from lynyrd skynyrd then you should defenitly check out this cd.
0525457585|4.0|Well, I watched the Neverending story constantly as a kid and still love the movie today as one of my favorites. The book starts off great in my opinion there were some small differences with names and things like Fantastica instead of Fantasia but halfway through the book it is pretty much where the movie ends. But, the book keeps going and Bastian takes a whole seperate adventure it is almost like two books. I could be biased from watching the movie first and not reading the book but. I still enjoyed the first half of the book but the end seemed to drag and I found Bastians adventure kind of boring.
B00009NHC5|4.0|I found this movie every bit aa suspenseful today as when I first saw it in 1967 - Love Hepburn.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I would order this again, i really enjoyed star wars.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Has it all: blend of thrill, action, adventure, elements of friendship and love. Recommended highly.
B000006MS3|3.0|Kate is dreaming on, so not the highlight like Hounds of Love. <br />Just a well made album with the same sound as Never Forerver. <br />So the songs are well made, well preformed and it's well produced, but it never hits me like some songs on Never Forever.
B00003CXDB|5.0|Proves the point: Grees is good at times !
B00000DQSS|4.0|Kate could write a great song, that we knew. On Never Forever she reinvents herself; Breathing and Delius show a more experimental Kate without losing the feel of earlier great work. <br />Babooska and Army Dreamers show another example of her emphasis for feelings. For some too sweet, but they are for real and that you can hear. The forementioned songs are great but not all are of that same level. So not a 5 star.
B0001KZM3O|2.0|Not a die-hard Pink Floyd fan, I started seriously listening to their music about a month ago and moved through their discography an album at a time. The Final Cut is remarkably the opposite of what I look for in Pink Floyd. Meddle, for example, is dominated by  great understated instrumentation, beautiful music; The Final Cut, I feel, is all about dramatic presentation. The music is good at points, but their constant switch between soft, gentle playing and screaming-their-head-off anger(?) (indignation, maybe?) is too jarring for my taste, and makes the good lyrics and songwriting a bit hard to listen to. <br /> <br />Now I realize the two albums came in different times, that The Final Cut was made during some sort of power struggle or something between Roger Waters and David Gilmour. And there is some good music on here; the saxophone which makes a couple of appearances, especially on the last track, is very good. But it's just not the same side of Floyd I grew to like without giving it some serious replay and re-listen.
B00004R7TP|5.0|A True Masterpiece in every way. The songs are Great and different in style, though real Kate. The production is outstanding for 1985. <br />Kate is sensitive, so is the album. <br />Kate is experimental, so is the album. <br />Kate is A Perfectonist, so is the album. <br />Kate proved with this album she is the best female artists the UK has to offer(and probably worldwide). <br />Kate captured the 80's but this album has proven to be timeless. <br />And it still grows on me. <br /> <br />Now about this Remaster; Back in 1985 I worked over at the Dennon dealer for the Benelux and this was one of the standards for listening and reviewing. <br />And CD was still a new item back then. <br />Listening to this Remaster, there is a more booming sound than earlier. But Drums do Boom (in real life!), so this is a more acurate presentation. <br />I Like It, I Love It! <br /> <br />Also the bonus traks are a real treat.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I never look to a solo album hoping it to sound like Pink Floyd.  That's a mistake to do so.  Howerver, I hear snipets of Floyd in this fine, fine album.  I hear Fat Old Sun, I hear Echoes, and Obscured by Clouds.  But yet, I hear pure Dave Gilmour.  I think it's the finest of all solo albums and I am a HUGE Waters fan.  It's defnitely mellow but beautiful. The guitar work is magical.  His voice clear and methodical.  It's the type of music you put your headphones on and drown out the world.  Calm yourself, and enjoy the sounds, the smells and the memories that will appear in your mind and \\"Take a deep breath now.\\" ; )
6305078491|5.0|This is a wonderful film,it is a vision of dream like<br /><br />moments for cobweb eyes. I being a horror fanatic have<br /><br />always read about this in spooky books,and had to see<br /><br />what all the hype was. It is not hype but fact. It is<br /><br />truly a masterpiece in the true sense of the word.<br /><br />The grain & hair particals on the film just inhance<br /><br />this even more,you really are in Carl Dreyer's world.<br /><br />The world of the supernatural.Please when watching it<br /><br />forget it is 2006 and pretend you are watching it in<br /><br />1932.What a (trick or)treat it must have been the first<br /><br />time it was shown.This jewel has everything and to copy<br /><br />a famous saying it has WALL TO WALL CREEPS AND HOT & COLD<br /><br />RUNNING CHILLS....THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW............<br /><br />NOTE:IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS THIS BUT UNLIKE THE OLD<br /><br />DARK HOUSE(1932 MASTERPIECE)THEY COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER<br /><br />JOB,HOPE CRITERION COLLECTION READS THIS.
B000089RVX|5.0|Wow, I love Amy Lee. I love this CD too and the live version. In fact, I love every song that Amy Lee has ever sung. I think that this is the only CD I own that I know every single word to every single song. The lyrics are captivating and it sends chills up your spine because you know that when she sings it, it sounds true, it sounds like she really means what she's singing. I can't even begin to explain how Amy surrounds me in her world when I'm listening to her. Her voice is so beautiful, she adds soft gentleness to rock music. It just flows so well. Evanescence is my favorite group and this CD is awesome so I recommend it to all you rock fans out there. You haven't heard anything until you've heard this angel sing.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Never thought he would come this strong again.  His last few albums have been good, but THIS is what I LOVE to hear from this man.  Prince's new album is incredible.  \\"3121\\" is a throwback to his 80's style, but updated with the sound of today.  BRILLIANT!!  If you download this album instead of buying you ought to be ASHAMED of yourself
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt is gifted.   No.    Loreena McKennitt is a gift.    No.    Loreena McKennitt is a treasure.    Yes, that is closer to the mark.    She has as beautiful and clean and pure and clear and sweet a voice as I've ever heard.  Ever.    These days, I'm not easily impressed by much of anything, but Loreena's songs actually make me shiver and my throat swell with emotion.    If I could choose one voice in all the world that would be able to descend into the very pits of Hell and soothe the tortured souls of the damned, it would be hers.    Even if she made an album accompanied by a kazoo, a rubber band stretched across a rusty can, and backed by a chorus of barnyard animals, her voice alone is worth 5 stars.  And of course, to the reviewer therein lies the problem.    Happily, Book of Secrets is NOTHING like that!  Accompanied by musicians noted around the world for their skill, and recorded at a studio with production equipment of the very highest quality, Book of Secrets is a musical and, maybe more importantly, a spiritual journey that Loreena has shared with the rest of us.      Until Book of Secrets, when I thought of Celtic music I thought of Irish music.  Not so.  As Loreena so beautifully demonstrates, Celtic tribes originated in the area of Eastern Europe/Western Russia/Persia centuries before the birth of Christ and migrated west (eventually stopping where Ireland/Britain is today).  She traveled personally to those places to find the roots of Celtic musical origin.  Book of Secrets is the result.      Some songs have a world music fusion flavor, some have a Middle-Eastern flavor, and some have a traditional flavor. But in each song, Loreena's unsurpassed voice, and her Celtic roots provide unerring direction on this musical journey.    At over 53 minutes and with 8 songs (average of nearly 7 minutes per song), each song is allowed to breathe and develop fully and to completely express the musical message Loreena wants us to hear.    1. Prologue.This song acts as kind of an overture for everything that is to follow with bits and pieces of the flavors of each.  2. Mummer's Dance. An achingly beautiful melody. Shivery for sure.  3. Skellig. A haunting and melancholy and lovely song with that touch of sadness that Celtic songs are famous for.  4. Marco Polo.  An exotic and pulsing instrumental with a definite Middle-Eastern flavor. You can easily imagine Marco Polo and his caravan journeying into strange and wondrous lands.  5. The Highwayman. This is a famous poem written by Alfred Noyes in 1836 (sometimes taught in high-school English classes) that Loreena has created music for.  So sad.  So beautiful.  If you read the poem as she sings, I guarantee an emotion-choked experience.  Probably my favorite song on the album.  6. La Serenissima.  A soothing instrumental featuring Loreena playing her harp. Soft and sweet, it flows like a gentle lullaby.  7. Night Ride Across the Caucasus.  The Caucasus Mountains are located near present-day Armenia.  This song is hardest for me to describe.  One thing is certain, it is beautiful.  The percussion is like horses hooves rising and falling through the mountains during a night of clouds and moon.  Her voice carries you along.  This was the very first song I ever heard by Loreena so it holds a special place for me.  8. Dante's Prayer.  A very spiritual conclusion to the musical journey Loreena has shared with us.  A musical prayer with strong vocal and choral elements.  Lovely and powerful.    In today's world of lies and violence and corruption and computer-generated-imagery (that is to say, made-up ****), Loreena McKennitt and Book of Secrets is NONE of those things.  This album is as honest and sincere and genuine as anybody could ask for.  I give Book of Secrets my highest recommendation.
0307276902|4.0|I bought this before all the hoopla over whether it is factually true or not.  Well, in my opinion, this a very well-written, harrowing account of addition and recovery.  Whether every fact in the book is correct or not does not alter the story.  I was gripped from beginning to end.  I also have a whole new compassion for recovering addicts.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Simply a transcendent and sublime work of art! Kudos to Annie and Larry and Diana and Ang and Heath and Jake and Michelle and Ann and Randy, et al, for their unflinchingly honest, life-affirming, and life-transforming achievement. For they have persuasively and hauntingly demonstrated by it that love is indeed a force of nature; an indomitable, primordial, and joyous force that can be misguidedly suppressed, but never actually bridled - either by those in its thrall or by any outside agency. As Ennis stated it, with characteristic brevity, to Jack in the film: \\"Ain't no reins on this one.\\"
B0001FUHV6|5.0|I think there are very few film scores that make a lot of sense without the movie.  This music is beautiful and timeless whether you have seen the movie or not.  But you should see the movie!
B000ASATYO|5.0|I've always enjoyed this movie and a couple of times a year I want to see it so I finally bought it.  Then realized that this was Peter Jackson's (of LOTR fame) first big movie (I believe he'd done some independent films earlier).  There is even a cameo of the director himself.  The special effects are amazing for the time it was done (and are still very good). Michael J. Fox is great as is the entire cast (including Jake Busey and some other recognizables).   Some deleted scenes are added back in.  It's a really fun movie.
0307165485|5.0|I read this book to my son when he was little and just bought a copy to share with my granddaughter.  I also sent a copy to my aunt to read with her grandson.  Kids just seem to love this book.  It really helps the little ones learn colors, numbers, vocabulary, etc. and have fun doing it.  And grown-ups never get tired of it because there is so much to it.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album blew me away too. I can't remember the last time I felt so emotionally invested in music. I also just picked up the latest cd from another Canadian, Andy Stochansky, called 100. Not that the sounds are anything alike, but it's definitely worth checking out too.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Everyone is reviewing the movie - it's incredibly hard NOT to, but having bought an advance copy of the DVD today (legal), AND having seen the movie, I'm glad to say the DVD transfer is gorgeous - they did it right.  Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is breathtaking and spectacular, while at the same time being almost Zen-like in its unhurried beauty and tranquility.  \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is destined to be among \\"Dances With Wolves,\\" \\"The English Patient,\\" \\"Out Of Africa,\\" \\"At Play In The Fields Of The Lord\\" and other sweeping, epic visual classics.  This film deserves to be watched on as BIG a screen as possible for its sheer, scenic beauty alone. I haven't seen \\"The Memoirs Of A Geisha,\\" (which won the Oscar for Cinematography), but they should have declared it a tie.  I was a little disappointed to discover that the film was shot at some of the highest points in Calgary, Alberta (Canada) - couldn't director Ang Lee find the same majestic beauty here in the good ol' U.S.A.?  And, if Universal Studios is listening, though the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is excellent, DTS sound on this DVD would have been outstanding.  I'm sure the out-takes would have been a lot of fun to see as well!  A few music videos (the score won an Oscar), could have been included.  Maybe all of these and more in the \\"Special 2-DVD Collector's Edition?\\"<br /><br />Since we're in Oscar territory, having seen both \\"Capote\\" and \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" while Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance was undeniably brilliant, (IMHO), Heath Ledger deserved to win Best Actor for his remarkable, INCREDIBLY understated and restrained portayal of Ennis Del Mar (still, all the while ticking underneath like an emotional time-bomb.)  Larry McMurtry (co-writer of the screenplay), wrote to Ang Lee and mentioned (between actual cowboys), \\"how important the non-verbal communication was just as important as what is spoken.\\"  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal GOT that completely - and they DIDN'T learn it from \\"Cowboy Boot Camp,\\" where they both actually went to prepare for their roles.  Their commitment was bringing the script to life (and the love between their characters contained within), as often what is NOT spoken between them means as much as what IS - for example, the tender way Ennis embraces Jack from behind by the fire, quietly telling him, \\"You're going to fall asleep like a horse standing up,\\" then gently rocking and humming to him.  Scenes like that are repeatedly and each time beautifully conveyed not only by them, but by ALL of the outstanding actors.  Michelle Williams as Alma (Ennis' wife), deserves special mention - a superb \\"quiet storm\\" throughout, the look on her face when Ennis is about to \\"go fishing\\" with Jack the first time is worth a thousand words.  When he closes the door to leave, you can see AND feel all of her hurt and pain as her world (and the man she thought she knew), is literally turned upside-down.<br /><br />Next, on a lighter note, let me put to rest the answer to a burning question on MANY people's minds, \\"Was that Jake and Heath jumping off the cliff (naked?)\\"  Upon careful frame-by-frame inspection, the answer is no, they were BOTH doubles.  (That's okay.  Some things are better left to the imagination!)  :-)<br /><br />In the DVD extras, it was very interesting to discover that screenplay co-writers Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry were trying to get this film made for years (since the debut of the short story in 1997), \\"but no one would touch it.\\" (It was known as \\"The Greatest Unproduceable Screenplay Ever Written.\\")  Focus Films producer James Schamus also said (when he was an independent producer), \\"I wanted to produce this film for years, but the world wasn't ready for it.\\"  And how Diana and Larry used virtually EVERY sentence in Annie Proulx's thirty page short story of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" in their screenplay, then \\"fleshed out the characters' lives,\\" to bring it to fifty pages - and then had to \\"make up the rest,\\" as they needed twice as much for the movie (and the flawless job they did winning them a well-deserved Oscar.)  What was most touching though, was what they said upon its release: \\"We are stewards of the story.  It's like raising a child, you hope the child is accepted and successful, and you send it out into the world and it ceases to be yours.  It becomes everyone's story.\\"<br /><br />The DVD interviews show it was so very obvious how EVERYONE involved in this film TRULY viewed it as a labor of love, and what drew everyone to it was the honesty of the characters in the script that made every perfectly cast actor want to bring their role to life (so brilliantly, I might add - after seeing it, you can't imagine ANYONE being anyone else but who they ARE in the movie!)  As Heath Ledger said, \\"I always like to try and bare my soul a little bit.\\"  Jake Gyllenhaal added, \\"I'm always looking for films that go after an emotional journey.\\"  When Ennis DOES bare his soul - when Jack leaves him at the end of their first season on Brokeback, and he doesn't expect the rush of feeling of emptiness he feels; when Jack tells him, \\"I wish I knew how to quit you, Ennis Del Mar,\\" and Ennis tells him to \\"go ahead and LEAVE me alone,\\" then completely and totally breaks down, emotionally and physically, because that's the LAST thing he wants Jack to do; when he visits Jack's room, then discovers how much and how deeply Jack always loved him (and in its symbolism, always wanted to protect and take care of him), to name only a few, are nothing short of completely DEVASTATING, and in these moments YOU are experiencing the same \\"emotional journey\\" Jake Gyllenhaal so accurately described without even THINKING about it.  To become so enamoured with these characters (their lives and their surroundings), that you didn't even know you were being seduced - therein lies the real beauty of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" - and a testament to the labor of love from everyone who brought it from thirty pages to the screen.<br /><br />In this epic, all-American love story that knows no preferences, boundaries or gender (only that of love itself), everyone can take that \\"emotional journey\\" that Jake and everyone succeeded in making with this timeless, outstanding film and DVD release. Not only will Heath Ledger (who tragically left us all too soon in 2008), be remembered for an Oscar-worthy performance and one that will always remain a legacy of his, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is destined and deserves to become an American classic and legacy that thankfully, the world finally seems ready for.ovie (and the flawless job they did winning them a well-deserved Oscar.)

B000EGF0QY|5.0|I've read all of Sedaris's works and \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" is by far his best.  David Sedaris can write a story about himself like no one else can.  He combines different essays explaining hilarious mishaps he has endured and the telling alone would be enough to give this five stars, but oh, the humor!  Sedaris's conflicts are hilarious and his take on them only makes them more so. From his childhood in North Carolina, to his trip to France, he explains all kinds of mishaps he has been in and works them in a whole-book. If you enjoyed J.T.Mccraes_Katzenjammer_book with its hilarity and off-the-wall humor, then \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" is one for you as well.

B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I imagine that James Dobson has ground his teeth down to the gums about Duncan Tucker's \\"Transamerica,\\" and I only wish I'd been around to see it. Tucker deftly tests the limits of the idea of the non-traditional family as he tells the story of Bree, a pre-operative transsexual in L.A. who suddenly discovers that--in her previous life as Stanley--she fathered a son. She heads East to find that son, Toby, who is now a 17-year-old New York street hustler with ambitions of going West to become a gay porn actor. But just when you think John Waters and Divine are going to show up, Tucker turns the tables on us and transforms the story into a sweet, if somewhat skewed, road trip movie about how family members both harass and nurture each other. The trip is far from a joy ride: Toby has a major attitude problem (as well as a nascent drug problem), and Bree, obsessed with getting back to L.A. and her scheduled operation, tries to keep her true identity a secret. The ups and downs of their trip and its aftermath, however, keep the film funny, fresh, and above all moving. Felicity Huffman won a ton of awards and critical plaudits for her performance as Bree, and she deserved every one of them. The astonishingly handsome Kevin Zegers portrays Toby's confusion and anger with touching realism. There are also fine supporting performances from Elizabeth Pena, Burt Young, Carrie Preston, and especially from two of the all-time great character actors: Graham Greene, as a friendly Navajo rancher, and Fionnula Flanagan, as Bree's toxic smotherer of a mom. \\"Transamerica\\" contains a few missteps (I'd have to recount far too much of the plot to say what they were), but they are minor. On the whole, this is a road trip you'll be glad you took, with characters you'll be glad you met.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|After seeing and loving \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" (five viewings?!), I embarked on a Jake Gyllenhaal mini-film festival, starting with \\"Jarhead\\" (BLECH). <br /> <br />Since I've been hearing about \\"Donnie Darko\\" since its release, mostly from slightly eccentric, highly intelligent people who mostly share my taste in movies, I rented it (The Director's Cut). <br /> <br />OHMYFREAKINGGOD. <br /> <br />From the first moments, I was completely and totally drawn in to this completely original, yet accessible film.  The plot has been discussed in countless other reviews, so I won't get into it here, save to say that is both bizarre and resonant.  Things are purposefully left ambiguous, yet there is an undeniable internal logic that holds the many threads (and clashing movie genres) together.  Visually this film is a stunner, with wild effects merging seemlessly with domestic and school scenes that seem perfectly normal but just a little bit \\"off.\\" <br /> <br />Everything in this movie has a double or a triple meaning, and virtually everything is symbolic or foreshadows something later in the film.  Frank the Bunny's line \\"Pay attention, you might miss something\\" applies to Donnie, but also very much to the viewer.  This is an incredibly \\"dense\\" film; cross James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" with Kubrick with \\"Requium for a Dream\\" with \\"Ordinary People\\" with any John Hughes teen angst movie and you end up with \\"Donnie Darko.\\"  That is, if you're an incredibly gifted screenwriter and director like Richard Kelly.  This film DEMANDS repeat viewings, as it reveals entire layers of meaning each time you watch it, and can easily make you obsessed.  A cult has formed around it, and there is a cryptic website as well as a multitude of \\"Donnie Darko\\" internet communities, FAQs, blogs, etc. <br /> <br />I noticed that many of the negative reviews were from people who'd seen the original and disliked the Director's Cut.  The criticisms mostly stem from the fact that Kelly explains a bit more in theDirector's Cut, but I can tell you, as a virgin viewer, it STILL requires a lot of puzzle solving and analysis; once you've seen this film, you just can't stop thinking about it.  Also, people complain about different music choices, and some additions and missing lines (particularly a key line from Frank in the movie theater).  Shoot, now I have to buy BOTH versions! <br /> <br />All of the actors are superb.  Both Noah Wylie and Drew Barrymore give the performances of their respective careers, Maggie Jyllenhaal, Jake's real-life sister, is wonderful as Donnie's sister, and the rest of the cast is equally good. <br /> <br />However, Jake Gyllenhaal really shines in the title role, as a hesitant teen with family troubles and a tough time socializing who is 1) either caught in a wild time-travel loop where only he can save the world, or 2) a paranoid schitzophrenic.  His halting manner, his hesitant voice, his odd tics, and most of all, his incredibly expressive eyes manage to convey a very troubled teenager who you can still empathize with.  Because you so feel for this character, the ending is both disturbing and deeply sad.  It's a tour de force performance, particularly from an actor that was only 19-20 when the film was shot. <br /> <br />This is no mere intellectual exercise; many \\"puzzle movies\\" engage the mind but remain emotionally cold and detatched.  Donnie Darko is the rare film that manages the nearly impossible task of having a mind, a heart, and a soul, in roughly equal measures.  DO NOT MISS THIS, I wish I'd discovered it sooner. <br /> <br />A definite 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I believe that true love, when it is discovered, is unescapable. I also feel the same about great movies. Sometimes in life an experience will come along that will change, if not define, an individual's life. Regardless it's content a deeply moving experience will forever rest inside the individuals soul, as will Ennis' love for Jack and this movie will for me.  <br /> <br />'Brokeback Mountain' is one of the finest American love stories I have encountered in some time. It's passion is intense and palpable. The character's of Ennis and Jack, as portrayed brilliantly by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, are caring, passionate, loyal, and tortured souls. Where Jack is more willing to accept his feelings and spend his life with the one he loves in this case Ennis, whom he falls in love with while watching after sheep on Brokeback mountain, Ennis lives with the fear and frustration of knowing such a courtship will not be accepted by the masses in Wyoming.  <br /> <br />Instead they go on with their lives, doing the proper things; get married, have kids, work hard long jobs. Their only solace coming from an annual fishing trip that allows them time alone to share their true emotions. The two men age and their lives fall apart around them, only their feelings for one another remain.  <br /> <br />I've choosen not to give too many details away about the story and the film. I recommend any one interested to see for themselves. 'Brokeback Mountain' is one of the most moving and haunting films of the past few years. It's a true work of beauty about love, loss, and the human spirit.  <br /> <br />'Brokeback Mountain' is many things to many people. Most of all it is an unescapable example of a love void of boundaries.

B000BSNPR6|5.0|This is a great DVD package: Live show on DVD, \\"Behind The Scenes\\" stuff (182 minutes!, that's a lot of BTS... :-)) ) and a live show on CD.  Unfortunately, it's not available here on Amazon (unless you buy it used), but it is well worth your money and time.  Good band (not one of my top 5, but good nevertheless), great DVD.
B000AA305M|3.0|He might have The Daily Mirror (`A masterclass in songwriting'), The Daily Telegraph (`A lush, expansive collection') and The Evening Standard (`Right now Britain's leading male singer songwriter has no peers') bowing before his gold-hemmed slippers, but the averagemusic buyer isn't going to prove as easy to win over for David Gray as he unveils his new release Life In Slow Motion. Sure, his fourth album White Ladder proved to be a surprise slow-burner success after its 1999 release, yet its emotive textures were undercut by moments of dull instrumentation and bedroom production. Recorded in the wake of his father's death, 2002's A New Day At Midnight was predominantly overlooked due to the absence of radio fodder, but actually stands up as a far superior and more enduring album than its predecessor.  <br />Three years on and with James Blunt nipping at his 10 million plus sales figures in the adult contemporary market, English-born and Welsh-raised Gray has finally upped the quality of his musical presentation with lavish strings replacing his regular beats from a 50p drum machine. Initial single The One I Love showcases the step into more bountiful arrangements, with Marius de Vries (Madonna, Bjork, Massive Attack) handling the increased instrumentation on a number of Life In Slow Motion's finer moments.  <br />For all its increased perks, there remains something inordinately dull about David Gray which, save for his bleating vocal style, leaves Life In Slow Motion a somewhat unconvincing return: Lately could be Keith Urban, Now And Always delivers an almost trancelike hum and The One I Love risks becoming a cover of Bruce Springsteen's Brilliant Disguise at any moment. However, even with a few plodding moments marring the album, Gray manages to subversively inject a spellbindingly ominous tone to proceedings, instilling Nos Da Cariad with an underlying darkness that aligns itself with the ominous sound of previous record A New Day At Midnight. Undemanding and easy to digest, Gray's surname remains one of the best summations of his sound, yet Life In Slow Motion still manages offer a handful of impressive tunes. Pack your bags, Mr Blunt, the professional troubadour has returned.

B0009YA386|5.0|Fresh-faced Brummie act Editors are proving to be Birmingham's most riveting musical export since Black Sabbath. Formed in 2003 and evoking the jagged guitar pulses of the current new wave insurgents without sounding derivative, the winning Editors blueprint is partially down to the distinct vocal style of frontman Tom Smith. Powerhouse The Back Room opener Lights finds Smith's deeply resonant voice intoning `I've got a million things to say' and quickly making his audience prick their ears to hear what's in store. Offering a taste of Interpol's cool sheen but adding statuesque melodies that adds the dramatic nous of Coldplay and U2 at their most epic, Editors appear intent on cutting out the middleman and making a lunge from dingy clubs straight to stadiums. If their live shows match the insistent sounds of Fingers In The Factories and its powerful guitar and drum tracks, as well as the lengthy and sinister trawl through Joy Division territory on Open Your Arms, it's highly possible these young guys will slaughter Coldplay in the capacity-crowd stakes before Chris Martin can even raise a limp textaed fist in retaliation. A debut as conclusively rich in quality as this will be hard to find when 2005 is done and dusted.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Five 'PURPLE' Stars!! Prince proves once again that he's one of the best ever and you can't improve on what works best. I bought the new single: \\"Black Sweat\\" (PG lyrics, thank you), on ITunes, a month before this release . And then I bought \\"Te Amo Corazon\\"and was amazed at the change in tempo and attitude. These two songs could just as well have been on \\"Purple Rain\\" in the 80's as well as on \\"3121\\", because Prince's music is TIMELESS and INNOVATIVE in his world of music.  <br /> <br />'Pieces De Resistance', the best of the best, are the songs we have already heard for a month: the super funky \\"Black Sweat\\" with unison handclaps and unison voices over the single stops on the bridge is as good as anything out there today. And the high-flying bossa-tinged \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" is pure hip beauty. Loved it, the story, and the hip latin band! Makes sense that the Purple One would dish up the best stuff first. Prince's music is like 'Stream of Conscience' music, totally integrated and telling a story from start to finish. This CD is a 'continuation', not a return, Prince is always around and always pushing the envelope, 'His Royal Badness' is BACK. Five Funky Stars!!!
B000A7S4B0|4.0|With Black Rebel Motorcycle Club frontman Peter Hayes' days in the Brian Jonestown Massacre having now made it to the bigscreen in the shape of intriguing documentary Dig!, it seems rather appropriate that the third album from his post-BJM trio would hark back to his acoustic past rather than the regular swathe of Jesus & Mary Chain sounds which previous albums BRMC and Take Them On, On Your Own preferred. <br />Almost five years on from their BRMC debut, Howl marks a Black Rebel Motorcycle Club epiphany that sees them discarding their sinful electric past and going for a walk on deeper water. Harmonicas, acoustic guitars and a whole lot of hootin' and hollerin' are all present from the outset, with the band offering praise to God instead of pretending they are gods. The religious mantra of opening tune Shuffle Your Feet is continued on Devil's Waitin', with the sombre Johnny Cash style of the lyrics and backing choir adding to the hymnal appeal of Howl. Simple acoustic style of songs of Complication Situation and Sympathetic Noose sound like weary acoustic takes from early Bob Dylan or Neil Young albums, but the rolling keyboard style of title tune Howl and the string additions of Weight Of The World prevent this album from sounding like a four track demo laid down on a Southern porch. With offerings such as the Lindsay Buckingham-influenced Fault Line and Gospel Song now offering a sound more spiritualised than Spiritualized, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club have taken a thrilling new turn with Howl. They might have ditched just about every former BRMC ingredient bar the tonal sleeve design, but this bundle of redemption songs is a potent new chapter from a band keeping the faith.
0385513755|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a novel that will make the world make a little more sense after you have finished reading it. This novel combines intelligent writing with strong religious content, and has more incoherent plot twists than a Spanish soap opera. This novel can very well be one of the best novels that I have ever read.<br /><br />  The novel's strong religious content has the ability to  grab you and keep you reading for hours,(because, one thing is for sure,I know that I did).<br /><br />  The Da Vinci Code also features the protagonist, Robert Langdon, a professor at the university of Harvard, getting an urgent call from a religious scholar named Jacques Sauniere, to have a meeting with him at the L'ouvre museum in Paris. Once Robert Langdon arrives at the museum, he meets a Paris police officer, named Capitain Fache. Fache is investigating the murder of the scholar Jacques Sauniere, the very same person that had contacted Langdon!<br /><br />  Once the two have met, they begin to search the museum for clues to help them solve the murder and discover what has truly happened.<br /><br />  As mentioned above, The Da Vinci Code has many twists and turns in its' great plot. At more than one moment in the novel, you think that you may know a character very well, and at the next, he may be a formidable antagonist. The novel is extremely well written as well, and will most likely keep you hooked from the very begining. The book also features references to Leonardo Da Vinci, Sir Isaac Newton, and, to my surprise, even Walt Disney! This novel also has lots of surprises in store for you.<br /><br />  Now, I was very lucky to read the Special Illustrated Edition of this great novel. What this special edition has is remarkably detailed photographs and illustrations which are  rendered in full colour, almost on every page. This is extremely helpful because the novel uses an advanced vocabulary, and I could not have understood some of the more advanced words, such as pentacle or what spread-eagle means. The novel also uses a bit of french from time to time, but it is very basic, and should not give you a hard time. As I have said, the illustrations help a great deal in making more sense out of the novel, and to paint a picture in your mind of what the novel is trying to tell you. Depending on your vocabulary, though, it would be safe to say that the Special Illustrated Edition would be well worth picking up.<br /><br />  Now, I would like to say that this is the best novel that I have ever read, no questions asked. However, this book is not reccomendable to everyone, which is it's only drawback. I say this because, as stated before, the novel contains religious content that may not be suitable to people of all ages, as some people may become offended by the theories it presents. Other than this rather small drawback, this book stands out to me the most, and highly deserves all of it's critical acclaim. It also grabs people who have never been that interested in reading, like myself, and keeps them hooked. I would give this amazing novel five out of five stars.he more advanced words, such as pentacle or what spread-eagle means.

B000B19BCG|4.0|Kaiser Chiefs have stolen their `cheeky scamps' media ruse, Bloc Party have pilfered their blueprint of energetic bursts and God has thinned their hair, but Supergrass have used these obstacles to their advantage on their fifth studio album. Having debuted some of Road To Rouen's tracks on support slots with Coldplay over the European summer, the follow-up to hits compilation Supergrass Is 10 finds the Supergrass japery of old well and truly exorcised. With the band now into their 30s and a long way from the days when Steven Spielberg wanted to create a Monkees-style television show around their chummy tomfoolery, Road To Rouen ditches the high energy pop of old favourites Going Out, Pumping On Your Stereo and Mary in favour of mellow paeans questioning where the band stand in today's pop world. The fact that this is the first album not to feature portraits of the quartet on the cover acts as an initial pointer to a change within the Supergrass world, with the forlorn lyrics of Road To Rouen finding the band apparently less self-assured than ever before. Once the grinning star of memorable video clips such as Alright and Caught By The Fuzz, a shell-shocked Gaz Coombes now sings lyrics such as `Before you know it's gone, turned to dust' on Sad Girl, `You cut me down, but there ain't no use in crying' on Kick In The Teeth and `I'm going nowhere fast' on the title track with a sense of paranoia and anxiety. While the harpsichord cool of St Petersburg and the spaghetti western instrumental of Coffee In The Pot ease the tension, it's hard to avoid the feeling that Supergrass are feeling spiritually detached from expectations, even noting `We hail commercial suicide' on explorative album opener Tales Of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 And 6). Strangely, moving from chipper to chip-on-shoulder has done wonders for the band, with the pitching of pop shackles creating Supergrass' most fulfilling album yet. Far more downbeat than even Life On Other Planets' black moments, Road To Rouenfinds Supergrass back on track and offering a great collection of tunes -  no matter how grey they fear their future may be.
6304493681|5.0|In Mamoru Oshii's outstanding Ghost in the Shell (1995), the director/writer gave himself little time, at less than 90 minutes, to explore the many questions he raised in that script.  With his long-awaited sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, he succeeds in answering many of these questions whilst at the same time giving us many more to ponder, in a film that, though flawed, deserves a 5 star rating. <br /> <br />Rather like a Disney animation, the film can be viewed on more than one level by more than one audience.  On the surface it is a sumptuously-animated film in which a fairly conventional who-done-it plot unfolds; robots are murdering humans, and a crime specialist is brought in to solve the case.  Period.  We have already seen equivalent plots in films such as Blade Runner or I, Robot and this film has nothing new to add to the basic idea.  However Oshii's world is far more disturbing and complex below the surface.  He subverts the ending of the film which, could be taken as a triumph of good over evil.  However, when distinctions between robot and human become blurred the central notions of good and evil in the film fall down.  He pulls other tricks to undermine our assumptions about humanity; at one point the main cop character puts a coat over a robot to hide its nakedness; another time a robotic character philosophises over the meaning of existence, whilst chain-smoking.  It is in the director's treatment of the paradox of what it means to be human that the film's value lies, not the superficial plot.   <br /> <br />Characterisation is a little scimpy (with the notable exception of the depiction of Oshii's own basset hound, which is drawn with clear devotion) but visually the film is stunning.  Oshii is one of the few directors able to practice the delicate art of inactivity on screen.  He is not scared to abandon the plot for minutes on end to luxuriate in, for example, an extended arial shot of a city, or to dwell on a completely motionless face whilst we register its owner's emotional state, or to allow his main characters, motionless on the screen for what seems like ages, to quote western philosophical and religious texts.  None of these scenes moves the plot forwards and yet the film would be immeasurably poorer without them.   <br /> <br />Too many sequels to outstanding films try to provide glib answers to the issues raised in the original and most fail by this approach; examples such as 2010 and Matrix Reloaded spring to mind.  With this film Oshii has avoided this pitfall and given us a rare sequal, that takes the theme of the original and finds something fresh to say.    <br /> <br />In summary, the film deserves a 5 star rating, but I think that it falls short of greatness.   <br />
B00006DEFA|5.0|For years, I hesitated to write a review of this film because I always thought I could never give it the justice it deserves.    When I first saw this film on HBO in the mid 1980's, I fell asleep.  The second time, I was fortunate that it happened to be on while I felt like sitting and watching something.  I was lucky, and I was entranced.    Besides the obvious incredible acting and scenery, and even the tiny details you come to appreciate later (like Salieri's self-professed suffering for 32 years - the same length as the entire life of Christ), you really learn things watching this movie.  My own narrow world of contemporary music was forever changed.  Vienna and Prague are on my list of cities-to-see-someday.  And what has changed the most is my perception of the boring-looking, flatly painted faces of centuries-old composers with wigs.  They were people just like those we know today - and often even more full of life than most of us.  No one else in the world of entertainment can possibly hold a candle to the genius and accomplishment of WA Mozart.  His rival at the time, Antonio Salieri, knew it then - and he knew that people in this century would still regard Mozart as the finest composer of all time.  The story supposes that Salieri desired that distinction for himself since he was a child, and indeed, he did become very famous composer.  Yet his unique ability to recognize Mozart's timeless talent and genius (not only in musical composition but also in the writing of moving and evocative opera storylines) became Salieri's own curse, his private hell, and it provided the substance and allure of the original play and film.      Although we all know that life can be largely unfair, few of us can imagine our life-long work, art, and talents -- which we prayed to God for -- being compared to that of Mozart.  It was too much for Salieri to bear, and so he plots to ruin Mozart.  His attempts not only fail but usually backfire (often comically so), and he eventually plots to kill him - but not before getting him to write his own Requiem (funeral) Mass and stealing it as his own, to triumph but once over Mozart -- and more importantly in the story, over God, whom Salieri believes is deliberately behind the unjustness of giving Mozart (a boastful, lustful child) \\"the voice of God\\" and the upright Salieri only the \\"ability to recognize the incarnation.\\"    After watching this movie many times, I also came to appreciate the weaving of God's supposed intentions in it.  Salieri asks himself \\"What was God up to?\\" and nearly answers his own question.  The first words uttered in the film are Salieri's asking Mozart beyond the grave to forgive him when, of course, it is too late.  As he tells the whole tale to a priest in his old age, it is obvious that he knows Mozart was robbed of a normal childhood and was possessed by his demanding father as prices for his talent.  At the time, he believes he is jealous of that price and its resulting rewards.  But Mozart's final words to Salieri are also \\"Please forgive me,\\" to which the startled Salieri never responds before Mozart dies.  As a child, when Salieri prayed earnestly to God to make him immortal through his music, he promised in return, among other things, his \\"deepest humility.\\"  At one point, he supposes that perhaps it is God after all who wants to test Salieri's humility by giving him the ultimate challenge:  to overcome his jealousy in the face of anything and forgive his archrival Mozart.  In the end, Salieri jokes at the priest's own mediocrity, not being able to discern what God was up to.    A few words about the different versions:  The Director's Cut is worth buying for the added features, for the entire movie on one side of a disc, and to see the additional deleted scenes.  Some scenes in the newer version add to the film (such as one where Salieri and Mozart joke at lack of talent of other musicians and some where Salieri is praying).  But the scenes where Salieri propositions Constanza in exchange for helping to secure a royal post for Mozart spoil the secrecy and aloneness of Salieri's struggle in that he voluntarily exposes too much character flaw to her.  For me, the film thrives on Salieri's outward appearance as an upright individual.  Those scenes (as improbable as they are in real life) also make it improbable that Salieri would refuse to leave Constanza's home at her behest in the final scenes or that he would be one of the few people, along with the grief-striken Constanza, attending the departure of Mozart's body from the city gates.  The scenes in Mme. Cavalieri's dressing room and where Mozart tries to school a pupil in an impossible situation are unnecessary to the plot and overdone; the innuendo alone was enough and was more artistic.  Still, I have both versions and would recommend them both.    A few final thoughts:  We know that while much of the story is true and some of it is based on rumor and conjecture, the commentaries make it clear that the writer took much creative license to make this masterpiece.  Some people felt as though it unfairly maligned Salieri; but ironically, Salieri finally become almost as much of a household name as Mozart due to this film.  Even I became interested in his works, and I noticed our public radio often playing it.  And as much as the rivalry between Salieri and Mozart is entertaining, I found the scenes where they get along and talk frankly to one another to be particularly delightful.  Finally, sparking an interest in appreciation of the art of classical music is the ultimate gift this film has.
0823023494|4.0|What a fun and exciting view of character creation. Excellent for ideas and a step-by-step process.
0307276902|4.0|Despite the publicity which started when I was 1/2 way through the book, it is a very gripping book.  Knowing that it isn't all truthful and an actual memoir, doesn't take away from the intensity of the book.  I read it for a good read, not for wether or not it was of actual events.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I love all the songs on this album. The people who are saying that this album is missing whatever-- you're wrong. True, Prince can never match his genius funk from the 80's, but 3121 is a rad album. Love the electronic kind of beats!! Anyone would like this album, Prince fan or not.
0451216725|1.0|What a waste of time this one was. I have never read any other books by Ken Follet and probably won't after the expierence I had with this one. I kept reading thinking at some point it would get better but it never did. Fortunately it is a rather short book. Some of the plot lines make no sense in the real world. None of the writing made me care for any of the characters. Seemed like this one was churned out to get a book to the publisher.  <br /> <br />Spoilers : <br /> <br />Things I thought were absurd. <br />1. Two couples from college who are double dating at the beginning of the book all decide to become spies when world war 2 breaks out. I am sure it happened all the time. <br /> <br />2. The hero of the story is willing to give up his entire college career and girlfriend for some girl he drove home in one night. No time spent building a relationship between the two. <br /> <br />3. The russian spy tries to cover up things by wiping the memory of the hero at the very same hospital that one of the other four friends works at. Of course that friend is conviently sent home that night. <br /> <br />4. The hero finds out his wife had a tubal ligation prior to thier marriage from a letter conviently left out at just the right time. And this fact allows him to make the jump from my wife lied to me to she's a russian spy. <br /> <br />5. Why even wipe the memory of the guy from the beginning, just kill him and be done with it. <br /> <br />6. The hero calls several people and explains his memory has been erased and that spies are after him. No one ever questions this guys sanity everything is just accepted as matter of course. In fact his wife says she can't come out and see him because she is too busy at work, that should have been the tip off that something was wrong. <br /> <br />It just goes on and on. I felt like I was reading something I would have come up with in the 5th grade. <br /> <br />Thanks for nothing Ken.  <br />

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Not just this album but I have seen reviews on albums for A Perfect Circle that say that this band is a Tool ripoff......do you guys want to know why this sounds like it's ripping off tool? because it is ripping off tool. Do you wanna know the reason why A Perfect Circle has the right to rip off tool? because the lead singer of A Perfect Circle and the lead singer of Tool are both the same person  =O (GASP!!) so stop posting crap and go do some more band research....A true fan of tool would have known that Maynard has Moved to A Perfect Circle......don't keep posting tool ripoff reviews and quit saying that Maynard should go back with Tool because he is back with Tool as I am typing this review.....Tool is coming out with a new album anyway so post on there and stop bashing this band. Don't getme wrong I love Tool, in fact Tool is the band that got me started with heavy metal and Ithink I speak for every Tool and A Perfect Circle fan when I say that Maynard is an extremely talented and creative vocalist and artist. He continues to show his talent in this band too including in this album. I think every song on this is great so Maynard if you are reading this don't listen to people who bash A Perfect Circle you can do whatever you want with your career and a true tool fan wil respect any decision you make. And I can't wait for Tool fo come out with their new album....I'm gonna buy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />As far as this CD goes it is GREAT work and is deserving of every penny, the unique guitar riffs and lyrics is what really got me into this album.
1577314808|1.0|Another adaptation of old ideas of Zen into the modern quazi-spiritual blubber.  <br /> <br />The very idea of enlightement is distorted and misunderstood. It's like suddenly getting this state of mind - and that's it, from now on life is just great: you are cool and wise, like a Chinesse sage. No, the idea is in the present moment, not some goal of spiritual liberation that must be achieved. <br /> <br />You want the \\"now\\" - start meditating. And if you want guidance, rather read \\"Hardcore Zen\\" by Brad Warner or \\"To Meet the Real Dragon\\" by Gudo Nishijima. Much less hype and much more substance.
0895260131|4.0|This book insults Islam on several levels.  Lets start with the series title's anachronim, the Politically Incorrect Guide, or PIG. Throw in the cartoon pig on the cover, and Muslims either cannot help but feel that their religion and themselves have been defiled, or those are Islamic apostates who will be appropriately dealt with.  But wait!  It gets worse!  This book is unbalanced because it reports the negative--true stuff, but only the negative.  What makes something an insult to Islam is how a Muslim man feels about that thing--doesn't matter if its true or not, NOBODY is allowed to \\"slander\\" Islam and live.  I'm not very clear on what objective standards govern this yardstick, and I've studied Arabic, read the Koran (old spelling, I know), and spent eight years in the Middle East.<br /><br />Like all religions, some Muslims are \\"more equal than others--\\" which kind of takes away the special status of Islam.  Did Spencer mention this?  I missed it.  In Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco, and Egypt, one's social status determines who is more Islamic and who is a traitor--but being born rich and powerful is Allah's will and is not questioned (or ELSE!)  That's no different than Communism, or any other religion.  The big boys make the rules.  Everybody else is wrong.  Period.  No discussion permitted.  That's why Islam is only a religion of peace in nations where Islam lacks power and influence.  Once the power to act is there, the Koran demands that three things be done with unbelievers: slay them, enslave them, or convert them to Islam.  Not that conversion will make these former unbelivers the equal of those born into the faith, mind you, but being a minor Muslim is better than being outside of Islam and having no rights.  That's the reason Islamic women support their own enslavement--they are only next to nothing in Islamic countries.  Us unbelievers are nothings.  The top of the heap are Arab Muslims, despite the power and influence of the Egyptians.  Are you \\"Islamic enough?\\"  That depends upon how much power Allah has given you on Earth.<br /><br />Spencer put a lot into \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (And the Crusades)\\" and I have only covered the surface, and one item that I didn't run across (about inequalities in Islam).

Ennis spends the rest of the film working on a cattle ranch and Jack spends a good deal of time as a bull rider in the rodeo, before he marries and joins his father in law's business.  In other words, they were cowboys.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|\\"Extended Edition\\".  Sure.  This is why we'll go ahead and chop out this and that.  An exceptional disappointment. <br /> <br />Best bet is to get one of the 'spliced together' versions out there.  Take the previous Dune DVD release and this extended hack and build your own version representing the best of the widescreen footage. <br /> <br />DeLaurentis can go jump in a lake for all I care.  At least the Sci-Fi channel version got the story right.
1878424319|5.0|This book is an easy-to-read, handy guide to de-programming ourselves from the negative thoughts and ideas that are limiting our lives.  Ruiz writes simply, profoundly and compassionately.  I keep a couple of copies of this book around for when I think someone might need it.
B00007GZR5|5.0|The film is one of the few that I enjoy immensely under repeated  viewings. In very basic  terms, this is a romance, a love, persisting through time and space. Based on a 1978 Matheson book, it takes some liberties with the book's story line, but in the end it produces a great story. Whilst the FX is very heavy in the movie, it is a necessary addendum to the story. In fact, wonderfully so. As is noted in the commentary, both Williams  and Sciorra have worked together before, and it shows.  The chemistry they have, Robin Williams' intensity, especially  with the script comment \\"It's not about understanding, its about NOT GIVING UP\\"; all in all this film is a rare work that illustrates the power of persistance, and the power of a love renowned for beauty.  The key extra is the commentary; the director provides some great insights into the film. And the feature which is short, covers some good points. I personally love the commentary comment that  says  \\"I spent some time in Australia for my sins\\". Tasmania excepted :-).  All kidding aside, this is a masterwork, for this life and the next, wether you believe it or not, once you see the film, you may just see once the film takes you to the Gateway of believing.
B00003CY6M|4.0|This movie is definitely a must-have for John Cusack lovers! Yes, it's a bit cheesy here and there, but overall it's a nice story with a great cast!
B00003CXTG|1.0|When a film went so horrendously wrong (examples: Pearl Harbor, Armaggedon, The Rock) that even an Alan Smithee won't do, there's only one name that will.  Give it the ole \\"Directed by Michael Bay\\".    C'mon seriously, you didn't believe there was one guy who would create all these horrible movies, be able to keep his job and wish to claim credit on them all?
0446691437|5.0|As a struggling artist, I've read a lot of artistic \\"self-help\\" books. This one is the best, hands down. It doesn't coddle you, or gently lead you along like you're a kindergartener. Steven Pressfield has fought all the creative battles imaginable and is living to tell about them. A must read for anyone who considers themselves an artist.
B00000F14B|5.0|This is the classic Music Man with Robert Preston, as you are taken aback to a simpler time and place. The wonderful tunes, all star cast, and songs that those over fifty can sing along with, make this a great addition to any collection.
0201633612|5.0|\\"Design Patterns\\" provides an excellent introduction to design patterns through a running example using a number of different patterns.  Further it provides very well-structured descriptions, diagrams, and example source code for the 20some widely used patterns in its catalog.
B0000033WC|5.0|5 Stars for the original, even if Lou Reed hated that mix. If Evan McCausland implies that Moe Tucker only ever did a turn at vocalizing w/ the VU on this overloaded version of \\"Loaded\\", I must ask:  Who do you think sings the vocal on \\"Afterhours\\" from the eponymous 3rd album? Many of these extra tracks are found on Lou's first RCA solo album (the one w/ the kinda Faberg&eacute; egg on the cover) and \\"Sad Song\\" ended up on \\"Berlin\\".  Call me crazy, but I haven't found any of the VU digital remasters to sound anywhere as good as my original vinyl copies.  My mom threw out my copies of the first album (\\"the Banana album\\") 3 times.  And why doesn't the banana peel off the CD version like the LP version did back in 1966?
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Until I bought this album, my favorite album in the world was \\"Origin of Symmetry\\", Muse's previous album.  Admittedly, I'm a Muse disciple.  Most of my apologetic energy spent defending \\"Absolution\\" has been devoted to convincing other Muse fans that it's better than \\"OoS\\".  Within the circles of Muse fans, many claim that they have sold out and overproduced an album that was designed to cater to more mainstream sensibilities, and maybe even garner some U.S. radio attention.  The fact that Muse has jumped the pond and joined a U.S. label doesn't hurt their argument.  And while I'll grant that \\"OoS\\" was more achingly raw and purely emotional, the grander sense of purpose of \\"Absolution\\" puts it in the separate category of one of the best rock albums ever made, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Muse have now perfected that baroque, supremely theatrical, over-the-top essence that Queen first patented.  Where Queen tapped a more carefree, playful operatic, Muse in \\"Absolution\\" harnesses the important, *urgent* excess of apocalyptic proportions - literally, the album is about the end of the world.  Everything is so vitally important in this gorgeous theme album.  The end of the world is the perfect backdrop for Bellamy's soaring vocals and classical counterpoints.  The Rachmaninov interlude in \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" is Matt Bellamy's gutsy dare for anyone to not take his musical chops seriously.  My only concern is that, after this album, anything else Muse does will just seem silly in comparison.  It's hard to find something more important to urgently lyricize than the end of the world.
0064430227|5.0|My kids never get tired of this book....and to be honest I don't think I do either...Great book
B000AMWIVM|4.0|These two guys wake up chained up on opposite ends of a dirty utility room.  Whoever chained them up was brilliant, because the hand saw they are given doesn't cut through metal, but goes through flesh and bone.  They wonder why they're there.  One is calmer than the other.  In the room with them, there's a dead body, and in each of the hands there is a tape player and a handgun.  The two guys each have a tape with instructions on what to do in order to stay alive.  The madman behind all this is nicknamed Jigsaw, and he put his victims in these situations so to show them how precious life is.  In his eyes, people are killing themselves with drugs and whatnot that they don't take time to appreciate their own lives and what they got.  As the movie goes on, we, the audience find out information on the two guys.  One of the guys is a doctor and doesn't spend enough time at home with his wife and daughter.  The other is a photographer who, throughout the movie, we find out that he's been secretly taking pictures of the doctor. <br /> <br />This movie isn't as scary as I thought it would have been, but it is pretty disturbing and intense.  I'm pretty good at watching blood, but when the part where he had to saw his own leg off to free himself from the chain, I had to cover my eyes.  This movie made me think a lot.  Life is too short, and this movie will tell you to savor each breath you take.  <br />
B0009K8L5W|5.0|If you are expecting songs like the way-too-Estefan-ized tracks from Laundry Service and Fijacion Oral, look elsewhere.  This album is not really Shakira's debut, but it is the album that launched her to superstardom, and for a good reason: it has good songs.  Most are romantic ballads with lyrics that somehow apply to everyone's relationships, but check out \\"Un Poco de Amor,\\" a reggae-laced pleaser that will have you singing along.  Then try \\"Quiero,\\" a masterpiece of simple elements that progresses to a fast-paced chant.  Of course you'll like the singles too: \\"Antologia,\\" \\"Pies Descalzos,\\" \\"Donde Estas Corazon,\\" and \\"Estoy Aqui.\\"  This is pure Shakira, before she sold her soul and greas to the US market for a bleach job and a Cristina Aguilera-style wardrobe.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Excellent purchase.  I love the Eagles and the concert very much. <br /> <br />Pleased as punch.
B000244EMO|5.0|Excellent to watch on a rainy day even after you've seen it a dozen times!
B0002OERI0|1.0|Macy Rockaway, this includes you! This album is so stupid. American Idiot is yet another cash-in on the entertainment world bashing on President Bush. The title track was crap. Boulevard of Broken Dreams s*cks. Wake Me Up When September Ends is just awful. Billie Joe is a woman in man's clothing as he wears mascara and eye-liner. Is he gay? Buy Pink Floyd's The Wall instead as that was a true concept album, unlike this trash!
0790729393|4.0|DeNiro was awesome as always.  Good surprises. Very entertaining and makes you think. Excellent cast. Brad Pitt doesn't ruin it but kept me from giving this a 5.
B00004XQP4|1.0|Green Day devolved from fake punk to a band singing songs in Grease. American Idiots describes these clowns. Warning did not do well and I can see why, it sucks. Radiohead unleashed Kid A the same day and yes it KILLED this album in the US hitting #1 whilst these bozos sank from popularity only to come back thanks to poseur kings eMptyTV and bashing Bush which seems to be the typical thing one does today.
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|When this DVD is worn out, I'll buy another and wear it out too.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|You call yourself a Dire Straits fan, you are full of it. You probably are some punk kid who j**ks o** to Britney pictures. Anyhow, all 5 of Dire Straits' albums from 1978 to 1985 were classics. However, On Every Street S*CKED!
B00005Q4CS|1.0|I have had a crush on Jennifer Connelly for years.  In fact, I married a girl named Jennifer and forced her to have plastic surgery to look like Jennifer Connelly.  No just kidding.  I did buy this movie for her though as she has been so awesome in her other roles.  She did a fine acting job...the movie just sucked!  If you plan on buying it, at least rent it before you buy it.  Of course, if you decide to buy it, drop me a line.  I watched mine once and don't think I could stomach it again.
B000AADYYO|5.0|The previous reviewers can go f*ck themselves. These are some of the most passionate and intellegent musicians around these days and this record is excellent-sh*theads.
0739316478|3.0|If you're a Grisham fan and are reading all his books, you might as well read The Broker.  It builds steam early with an interesting premise, but as others have written, it descends too quickly into a tour of Italy that takes up most of the book.  The end is strong, but all in all, The Broker is relatively a bore - especially compared with all Grisham's other books.  I listened to The Broker on unabridged CD, and while Michael Beck does his usual great job narrating, he can't add any real vigor to what's ultimately a tedious exploration of Grisham's love affair with Italy.  If you've visited the city of Bologna Italy, I imagine the Italy part would be a fun read.  For most others I think it will get old fast.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is populated with a great cast, interesting story lines, and nicely done SFX. <br />Don't miss the movie Serenity all the characters from the series are in the movie and it too is Five Stars!
0201633612|5.0|This book gives a nice overview of what high-level abstractions to think about, mostly when writing new software. It is used extensively as a college undergraduate textbook for team-approach programming courses in order to supply a vocabulary for student discussions. Some of the concepts are outdated by now (2006), and are not domain-specific enough for some purposes, but as an overview or first approach to the subject of patterns it is the gold standard.
B000E5N62U|5.0|First off, I am a huge Steely Dan fan and I like DF's solo ventures as well.  I loved the Nightfly,  but was a bit disappointed in Kamakiriad...thought it was a little bland.  I was even slightly disappointed with EMG, but I loved Two Against Nature, so I wasn't sure what to expect from Morph.  Rest assured, this album is great and is destined to become a Fagen classic along the lines of Nightfly. <br /> <br />As with most Steely Dan/Fagen work repeated listenings pay off immensly.  At first listen I liked Morph The Cat and What I Do the most, but now after listing about 10 times I can truly say that each song is excellent and satisfying in its' own way.  The lyrics are sharp and the melodies are layered beautifully and Fagen's voice do each song justice. <br /> <br />If you like great, sophisticated music or would like to be introduced to it, go out and buy this one...you won't regret it.
B000BB1MHS|5.0|I've been a fan of the original Willi Wonka (book and movie) from the time I was a kid many, many moons ago.  So I was skeptical about a remake.  Johnny Depp is fabulous and reinvents his own wacky Willie Wonka, rather than just recreate Gene Wilder's.  Lots of subtle adult-type humor, but the movie is just fine for the little ones too.  Mine--ages 2, 5 and 7--really enjoy is as well.  And of course the sets and the effects are fun too.  Although I prefer the original Oompa Loompas!
B00000DGUM|5.0|Excellent compilation of the greatest hits from this rock band.
0743265289|5.0|I had done a bunch of studying before this book (beginning with Princeton Review, then \\"math workout\\" books by Princeton Review and GMAC, methodical plowing through the official guide, and even some surreal time spent with crazy Barron's GMAT prep).  This was just what I needed to regain some humility a few weeks before taking the test.  The questions are indeed hard and I got a lot of them wrong.  To me, that was a really good thing.  You can lull yourself into a false sense of security with the other books because they are geared for 600-650 scores.  Don't get me wrong - those are good scores - but if you are determined to break through 700 then you need a book that will light a fire under your rear.  The reason I say this book is silly is because throughout the book it has these tips that use the language: \\"An 800 test taker recognizes...\\" or \\"An 800 test take is able to...\\"  To me, that's a little corny and insane.  But after you start to feel a little bored by the other books, give this one a try.  You can get through it in very little time (the type is big and the margins are wide) - even though it's thick, it goes very quickly.
B00007JVBI|5.0|This CD is definitely in the running for my favorite album of all time.  Every song on it is beautiful and I find new things no matter how many times I hear it.  It goes with every mood I have.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Well, I've always had a deep respect, and I  mean that most sincerely.  But, nothing on this CD grabs me.  Nothing on this CD makes me want to drag a friend home to hear this music or discover its allure.  It's flat.  I don't understand the lyrics.  I really am disappointed. <br /> <br />I have been a Floyd and Gilmour fan from the beginning.  My wife as well.  We just looked at each other in dismay as we listened to this the first time.  I don't doubt that my copy will gather dust on a bottom shelf somewhere.  Sorry. <br /> <br />I give it 2 stars for production quality and packaging.  Have a cigar....
B000ASATZ8|5.0|All the grabboids and ass-blasters that your little heart desires. Campy sometimes silly series of movies about prehistoric creatures and a core group of people who learn to capitolize on them to save their little deadend town.<br /><br />Good light hearted entertainment.
B0007GAERG|2.0|This has got to be the most derivative stuff I have ever heard pass for a \\"great album\\". <br /> <br />There is not a single memorable melody on the album.  And she needs to leave the hip-hop singing style on the shelf. The unison line with the high hat thing is for kids and people with no singing talent. <br /> <br />Who mixed this down? The piano and keys are buried in the mix.  Maybe there are melodies, they just buried them in the mix. <br /> <br />The young Michael Jackson thing is right on. Exactly what she sounds like.
B00005JOE8|5.0|To start off...where do you get that this film is ANTI-BUSH? This film had nothing to do with Goerge Bush ((for those of you who cannot tell I am bashing the review V is for Vendetta, T is for Terrorism.)) It is not against Bush, and it DOES NOT portray the gay life-style as the only worth-while lifestyle. For that we have Brokeback Mountain. But! On another note, this film has it's ups and downs. But this is a great movie, I highly recommend it, compared to the graphic novel, I prefer the book but this movie has its own sequences which are very tru to the comic. The ending, the 'V' domino effect. If I could I would give it 10 stars.
B000E97HIA|3.0|Nothing special here.  Musicology was much better.  He has some nice tunes, and I am sure his tour will be rockin' as always, but a pretty pedestrian performance by the Man, the Myth, the Legend. <br /> <br />I will still go see him live, you cannot beat it.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is a wonderful book, engaging the reader, enabling them to watch these people live, as if right by their side.  At first, I was a bit taken aback, wondering why in the world someone would recommend this book, but the reason soon became clear, diminishing any previous doubts.  Heller is able to bring these characters to life, using his words to create realistic imagery.  The characters become real, living, breathing people in your mind as you join them in their missions.  It even leaves a sort of mystery until the last page or so.  As much praise as Catch-22 deserves, however, there will be some that will argue, saying the language is too harsh, or the context too mature, but it is well written, and a true depiction of the lives of the people at war, or during the time.  With all of the seriousness, though, Heller provides comic relief through Yossarian's sarcastic antics, making the novel somewhat hilarious.  A person expecting a fairy tale, or an easy read, probably should not read this book, but I would still recommend it for readers of various sorts, whether you like action, war books, or not.  It really is difficult to go wrong when choosing to read Catch-22.
1560100842|5.0|I got this book for my first traditional animation class and have found it to be very useful! Blair explains and shows how to draw actions of both humans and animals in all different types of cycles (walk, run, sneak... etc cycle). A great book to help you get started on learning and understanding animation.

B00005JLYW|1.0|Horrible, truly horrible. I lost a little more faith in the human race after sacrificing 90 minutes or so of my life on this assault on the senses. I hope this movie wasn't intended for the over 10 crowd. Any homosapien with a working brain that enjoyed this should be donated for use as human shields. American movies just get worse and worse. It's an insult. By the way I'm sure they will make a third one of these steaming piles of horse manure. Outside of this drek the new thing now is just taking any old TV show or movie and, drumroll........REDOING IT! WOW, WHAT GENIUS! The way they make it DIFFERENT though is the make it much WORSE than the origional. You see how they pull that off? Great huh? Just yesterday in the same breath I heard of the two latest redos. Dallas and get this, The Dirty Dozen!?! Now is NOTHING sacred any longer? Can't wait for Miami Vice (sic) I'm sure that will be just great. At what point did they stop even TRYING to make good movies. They have become just sheer product with no artistic merit whatsoever. I don't bother to go the movies any more. $9.50!!!! No thanks, I'll stay at home and watch Full House reruns on Nick at Nite before I'll do that. My last point going back to the Charlie's Angels movie, this thing plays like a 90 minute inane music video. Enjoy.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This is a horrible movie. As an American Moore should have more respect for the man that represents our nation. Even if Moore doesn't agree or like Bush he should not have gone so far as to make such a film. Moore should be imprisoned for this film. I whatched about 30 minutes of the film and walked out, not because I support Bush(which I was nuetral about in the election) but because it is terrible and unamerican to do to our president. Just because you don't like him doesn't mean a movie should be made. Moore should had thought twice about making this film.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I had mixed expectations about this movie. It sounded like an Oscar vehicle with an overly GLAAD oriented story line. When I heard Ang Lee was directing however I was compelled to see it.  The movie is from start to finish a through and through work of art.    It's touching without being heart-stringy, presenting believable, well developed human characters in realistic situations. It's well paced, allowing situations to evolve organically without lingering too long or jumping away too quickly.    In terms of acting I was most surprised. Before this movie I would tell anyone that I hated both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal (especially Bubble Boy), but they were too believable in this movie. Their performances were good enough to make me, probably their biggest detractor, praise them for Oscar worthy jobs.  Without gushing too much more, the movie is (like all Ang Lee movies) a technical masterpiece, with beautiful stark cinemaphotography, fluid editing and exceptional use of sound. In shot, buy it.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Great series!  I have to admit I was not a series fan, nor did I even know that it existed, until I saw the movie Serenity.  The series gave a great history to the movie, and even more information about each of the characters.  Love it!

B00005J6T0|3.0|I would like to fancy myself as one of Madonna's biggest fans, but this album is just not one of my favorites. I was really disappointed in this one and I'll tell you why. It starts out great with \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" which has an awsome dance beat. Then \\"Open Your Heart\\" another one of my faves, I like \\"White Heat\\" but could do without the James Cagney sound bytes in the beginning and middle. \\"Live to Tell\\" is a beautiful ballad, (got me through my lonely teenage years). \\"Where's The Party\\" is bad. If I was invited to this party I'd skip it. It's just so bland and it has this beach party feel to it-not cool. Next is the worst song ever- the title Track-\\"True Blue\\"- it's so annoying and cutesy, I guess she was trying to get that \\"doo-wop\\" effect-anyway it just comes out bad. \\"La Isla Bonita\\" is ok, very cliched, though- it sounds like something Cher would do. \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" is annoying annoying- She must have been chanelling Cyndi Lauper for this one. The last track \\"Love Makes the World Go 'Round\\"- sounds like she went to the Islands for a vacation and couldn't get the island rhythms out of her head! The remastered Disc has a remix of True Blue- but nothing can make this song any better-IMO, and an Extended mix of \\"La Isla Bonita\\"- which can be done without. I will keep this because I am completing my Madonna collection, but it's one that will collect a lot of dust on my CD rack. If you're not a serious Madonna fan like me-skip it.
B0002EXH54|5.0|Megadeth has had almost as many lineup changes as Iced Earth, but before they became known for having countless lineup changes', megadeth created some of the greatest thrash metal records of all time. Peace Sells...But Who's Buying is a phenominal record. This album made me a fan of megadeth. Songs like \\"Wake Up Dead\\" \\"The Conjuring\\" and \\"Peace Sells\\" are just some of the tracks that show off the great musicianship the original megadeth lineup had. The chemistry Mustaine and Poland have is amazing. This album truly gave Mustiane and Poland guitar god status. Dave Mustaine, Chris Poland, David Ellefson, and the late Gar Samuelson truly make this album a classic. Pick up this album if you don't have it. It is truly a must have. And as for that stupid i love fall out boy braud, shut your mouth. Go shove those stupid fall out boy cd's up your A**!!!!!
B000AGTPUA|4.0|Not only my children, but also my husband and I enjoyed watching this.  It is fun and has the nice holiday spirit running through it.  I only gave four stars though because it does get a bit intense in some parts and my younger children were frightened a little.

0307276902|5.0|Even though most of the events written about were found to have been  embellished by the author, it was still a great read.  I was required to read this book for a Masters level forensic social work class, although I was going to read it anyway.  It gave me, a person who doesn't understand that level of addiction, an inside look at drug addiction, alcoholism, treatment, and recovery that I would not otherwise have had.  Whether the story was completely true or not, it was a good book and deserved to be on Oprah's book club.

6305428050|2.0|I bought this DVD based on the 87 good reviews. There was a one-star rating, but I thought it was an odd data point. I forgot what my HS history teacher told us: 50,000 Frenchmen can be wrong. Frankly, those who thought it was a 5-bagger must have all their taste in their mouths. I also question their sense of humor: there's not much that's funny about this film. <br /> <br />Still, if you are dying to watch a movie, and it's the only thing on TV, go for it, but don't waste your money buying it. <br /> <br />PS. Some of the language is a bit hard for a PG-13 rating. I don't advise watching it with kids. <br /> <br />PPS. The poster artists' immagination never ceases to amaze me. There is nothing in the movie that even comes close to the picture on the cover.
B00012QM8G|5.0|A great insperation film that should be watched by everyone. The film is great from start to finish with great performances and a great story. The movie is also well made becouse it's in blacka nd white which it self makes it a classic. the directing is great from speilberg. The film won best picture and is on many critics list as one of the best films ever. I would say it's a good film but not the best film ever but it's a must see film for everyone to see.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie surpassed all my expectations, so I was moved to write a review because I figured there would only be a couple if any of this little known movie. And to my great surprise it has over 300! <br /> <br />    So I will cut it short and simply say that you should give it a chance. You will be glad you did.
B000E33VWW|5.0|CAPOTE is a great movie.  Let that be said at the beginning of this review.  The superb screenplay by Dan Futterman based on the book by Gerald Clarke in turn based on that part of the  life of Truman Capote when he was obsessed with writing his final and finest novel 'In Cold Blood', and the extraordinary directing by Bennett Miller who influenced a fine production crew and coaxed brilliant performances from his cast is all a well established fact.  That all of this could be brought together in the featurettes that accompany the film on the DVD release is an example of just how fine additive commentaries can be. This is not only a superb film; it is also an equally superb DVD package.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman as the idiosyncratic author Truman Capote probes the psyche of this strange but gifted writer from his first newspaper clipping of the November 15, 1959 brutal murders of the Clutter family in Holbrook through his immersion in the tiny Kansas town accompanied by his friend and fellow writer Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) absorbing the atmosphere where such a deed could happen, ingratiating himself with investigator Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) and his wife Marie (Amy Ryan) to gain access to information that will eventually result in material for his projected book.  He becomes obsessed with the murderers Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), connecting with Smith in particular on a very basic level and providing the men with lawyers to appeal their conviction for a long enough time to eventually hear the truth of the night of grisly mayhem that fascinates Capote so. The story ends with the execution of Smith and Hickock in 1965, an occasion that further bewilders the now fragile mind of Capote as he gains the end to his story while simultaneously watching the loved Smith dangle from the scaffold in death.  Each actor is exceptional here: Hoffman does indeed deserve his Oscar for a brilliant portrayal.<br /><br />But it is the aftermath that brings even more poignancy to the film.  Hearing Bennett, Clarke, and Futterman discuss the origin of the cinematic idea blends naturally with the production crews' commentary about the choice of Winnipeg, Canada as the location to depict Kansas, the thorough preparation of the design and costuming and color palette and camera techniques, and then the comments by four of the main actors (Hoffman, Keener, Cooper, and Collins) illuminate not only the characters they depicted in the film but also the dynamics of entering into this strange world of bleak winter murder.  The effect of the featurettes is staggering and makes the viewer want to immediately replay the entire movie.<br /><br />This DVD package should serve as the template for future releases: the disc in its entirety is an art form that has few peers.  Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, March 06h that brings even more poignancy to the film.

B000E97HIA|1.0|The 5-star reviews are from record label interns desperate to hype up this record, but I'll give you the truth: this record is very dated.  Prince has always been a weird one.  He's been completely dethroned by a slew of better, more talented artists: Britney, Kylie, Beyonce, Justin, and Jessica.  The list goes on.  I'd stay away from this turkey; it isn't any good.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Definitley, I have no complaints on this one ! He finally did what he was supposed to do \\"Finally\\"! Musicology was a good cd but we had heard it all before. After \\"Emancipation\\" it just seemed like prince had just start making retreads of his better days. Especially on \\"Rave un2 the joy\\" I personally thought that was demo material. Rainbow Children was a experimental Jazz effort but wasn't true Prince. \\"Musicology\\" was about the best he had done in a while and at least was  a return. But Musicology's songs were not fresh they still sounded like something we had heard before with little experimentation.  <br /> <br />  But Noooo, Not 3121 this is a serious effort. I haven't heard anything like this from Prince before. This album sounds like the man that we loved so much. Not a retread but a continuation of his  versitile and creativeness he had in his late 20's early 30's. This album would have fit in niceley in his Warner Bros era ! For years prince had stop experimenting with electronic's, reverb, vocorders and synths ! And I think that is what killed his sound and made it alot more flat and boring ! On \\"3121\\" he brought all of it back I love Prince's electronic sound on his albums. All the horns and jazz renditions are cool. But unless he plans to sell records to the older crowd, this is where he need to stay. At 47 years old I think Prince is amazing to have the ability to come out with something like this. The only person I know that is remotely still rockin at that age is Madonna. \\"3121\\" is amazing I had my reserves  about purchasing it after hearing \\"Te Amo Corazon\\". Because I really felt that was extremley boring ! And I know Prince is not very inconsistant with what people feel. So I felt 3121 was going to be off on some jazzy smooth R&B. But boy was I wrong I really feel bad now. <br /> <br /> \\"3121' opening track its a jam, serious jam with eletronic Camile vocals. \\"Love\\" is just classic electronic Prince at his best if TLC were still around they would try to cop that ! \\"Fury' is just a simply amazing song, the guitar work is incredible ! And it just has this classic groove to it that only Prince can make ! \\" The Word\\" is another electronic bangin beat with a orchestrated flare to it ! \\"Lolita\\" is just classic Prince,very electronic it also reminds me a bit of 'Soft and Wet\\".\\"Insense and Candles\\" is a nice mid tempo cruising track with electronic vocal effects ! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, this is the best album Prince has done in 10 years. Just go and get it, it is worth the price ! I am very pleased to know that he still has it to make Fun, up to Date electronic funky music . I really hope this sells alot more than Musicology because it deserves too. This it the Real Prince finally ! <br /> <br />Thank you !  <br />For listening too your fans !
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Terri Reardon is at it again with her jealous rant against Britney.  It's getting old real fast.  Just get this thrilling masterpiece and avoid classic rock.
B000BJ7BCA|4.0|I saw this movie with pretty low expectations and it blew them away! This is a very good movie! Kurt Russell was in some Disney superhero movies in the late 70's and this is a kind of a modern version of one of them! The story is overall good and yes it is somewhat predictable, yet I was drawn in by some of the characters and to their lives. I felt some of their struggle.<br />Yet at the same time this movie does not try to be serious at all and that is the fun of it!<br />Very funny and engaging and wholesome family fun! Check out the DVD for more extras etc. I hope I'm not a sidekick!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand by Me is a necessary viewing film because it highlights the impact our youth had on our adult lives. In addition, the values of friendship, loyalty, perseverance and bravery are hallmarks of the film. It comes highly recommended.
B000001F9E|5.0|This cd is great old rock and roll, it brought back a lot of memories.  I enjoy it as much today, as I did way back when.
6304493681|5.0|This is one of the best anime's of all-time, not only for the animation, but for all the layers of psychology in the story.  Sometimes it's hard to know what's going on, but that's part of the amazing atmosphere.   <br /> <br />Plus, the whole idea of The Puppet Master has to be one of the all-time great concepts for a villain.  The notion of a hacker using you and not only wiping out your real memories, but also creating false ones really plays out in a terrifying way in this movie.   <br /> <br />The music is also killer, and the English dub is much better than is typical for Anime from the nineties. <br /> <br />If you're into anime, this is a must-have. <br />
0425205061|5.0|This is the first Jack Reacher novel and a fine thriller it is. The hero is arrested for murder without knowing why in a small town in Georgia. The twists and complications build up from there and are the harbinger of a writer who keeps on writing action filled books with intelligent plots and who hardly ever dissapoints.
0060899190|5.0|I love this book, so moving and emotional. I open up to any page and see a secret that I have once felt. Great book!
0895260131|1.0|(This review is of the CD audio version)<br /><br />If you already believe or want to believe that Islam is evil/violent/etc., this will give you lots of ammunition, in a package that will sound scholarly to the nonscholarly.<br /><br />If you want to see how the far right's propaganda works, this is a great example. Most of the language is that tired old \\"Liberal media and leftist academics don't want you to know this, but the Truth is...\\" stuff.  Rather than a guide to Islam, we get a steady stream of \\"PC Myths\\", \\"Jesus versus Mohammed\\", \\"Book You're Not Supposed to Read\\", and \\"Some Islam Apologists will tell you that...\\". In other words, the audience for this work is not someone who wants to learn about Islam, but rather the conspiracy theorists who've arranged their belief system around that \\"liberal media\\" strategy of the right wing propagandists.<br /><br />The sections begin with phrases like \\"Islam: Religion of War\\" and \\"Islam: Religion of Intolerance\\", with cherry-picked quotes to support the claims. They hired someone with an intelligent-sounding voice to read it, but the content is ranting, and as another reviewer pointed out, repetitive. The author crammed a half a CD's worth of material onto seven CDs.<br /><br />I'm very open to the possibility that Islam is, at its core, violent. I suspect that it is (though I wouldn't claim to know), and was hoping to learn something about that question. But this work is so obviously just shallow propaganda, transparently aimed at persuading gullible readers against Islam, and so undermines its own persuasive goal if you're a fair-minded reader. You're more likely to come away thinking less of Christianity in light of the shamelessness of the author.<br /><br />If you want to learn something about Islam, don't bother with this. Despite the title, the work is raw political correctness, and not a good source of information. However, again, if you're interested in the nature of right wing propaganda this is a solid example.is a solid example.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Another genious album by Prince, enough said. Favorite tracks: <br /> <br />Te Amo Corazon <br />Black Sweat <br />Love <br />Fury <br />The Word <br />The Dance
B000B8IA2G|4.0|I became a fan of \\"Stargate Atlantis\\" through \\"Stargate SG1,\\" which I think is a better show. But Sheppard is starting to grow on me, though I wish something would happen between him and Tayla. But I digress. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the show, this is a great set to have. The set also include the two-hour kickoff show, so you don't need to buy that separately.  <br /> <br />However, I have some criticisms of the DVD set itself. I think it was cheaply made, because you cannot return to the menu if you are in the middle of watching a show. So if you lose track of which episodes you've already seen on a disc and start to watch one you've already seen, you must fast-forward to get to the end of the show so you can get back to the menu and pick a different one. That wastes a great deal of time. <br /> <br />I like that the people who made the set tried to come up with an interface that looks like what you'd get if you were flying a puddle jumper. However, they made it too confusing. I still haven't been able to find out if there's a commentary track for each episode, like there is for many of the \\"Stargate SG1\\" episodes on DVD.  <br /> <br />If I could give half-stars, I would give it a 3.5 because of all the difficulties in actually using the DVD. The shows, however, rate a 4 or 4.5. I just love scifi, and \\"Stargate Atlantis\\" is shaping up to be a good show.
B00005ARDC|5.0|If anyone has every done any psychodelic drugs out there (and I know there's a few you that have), you will immediately recognize this band's angle.  The album comes in slowly, becomes intense, and leaves as slow and easy as it started.  Each song is a new feeling or idea that becomes intense and wrapped up in emotion.  The music captures perfectly the pace of life, and how we as humans deal with life.  The lyrics are just simply brillant.
B00008AY3L|5.0|I thought that this cd was great. I really wish he would put Diamonds On The Inside on one of his greatest cd's.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Walk the Line has already been well-reviewed; as others have said, this is the poignant story of Johnny Cash's rise to fame and the origins of his life-long love affair with his second wife, June.  Leads Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon each excell in their roles, with respect to both their acting and their singing.  Phoenix's performance in particular was reminiscent of Val Kilmer's portrayal of Jim Morrison in the movie The Doors, so fully does he embody his character.<br /><br />This movie was well-done overall, but some of the deleted scenes, while brief, so enhanced the film that I wonder at the rationale which caused them to be left out of the theatrical release.  Specifically, several scenes expand on the relationships amongst the main characters, from showing Cash's first encounters with Jerry Lee Lewis and the Carter family to providing glimpses into tender moments between Cash and his first wife.  Perhaps the producers were reluctant to add to the movie's already lengthy running time (135 minutes), but honestly, the story was so engaging that I never once looked at the clock.<br /><br />If you missed this film in the theater as I did, don't hesitate to try the DVD version--I promise you won't be disappointed.
B000E97HIA|5.0|This record has a open, free feel to it that has been lacking in most of Prince's recent work. The foundation is classic Prince, yet it sounds modern, it's not similar to any of his previous records, it stands alone. For the first half of the album, the song's fun and energetic, the second half reflects more depth and spirituality. <br /> <br />Great Album!
0783219695|4.0|This one is a fun watch. It isn't Great Cinema, but who cares?
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|This took a little longer to receive than I thought it would.  It arrived in great condition though!!!
B00000G3I2|4.0|While I get a kick out of watching younger versions of Glenn Close, Kevin Kline and JoBeth Williams, this movie just makes me feel OLD. Maybe that's because I AM old. Kind of dated plot, themes, music, etc. Nostalgic for some, but I didn't think Meg Tilly was as hot as the film thinks she is.
0812975219|2.0|There is no common theme running through this book. The reader is just led along as Taleb spews forth incomplete philosophical blather, and comes across as someone who likes to hear himself speak.  The reader endlessly wonders what the point is, especially after the first few chapters of the book where Taleb is constantly reminding you that he'll make his point in a later section.  It becomes a lot to wade through; it could have been edited down considerably to get at his main points. <br /> <br />However, at least he attempted to tackle the idea of randomness, which is admirable.  Still, I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody.  It's just too directionless.

B000BMSU68|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off <br /> <br />Today Mathew Broderick is setting record-breaking ticket sales on Broadway for his performance in the highly acclaimed hit The Producers, myself and a few others will always remember him as the kid who could not be caught, the inspiration to any teen in high school, the icon, the one the only, Ferris Bueller! I know... a little too dramatic. It just goes to show that John Hughes in his prime is to this day the most inventive writer and director of teen comedies, and even though the generation has passed, his films, especially this one will live forever. <br /> <br />Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broderick) is an innocuous fast talker; he knows how to handle every situation that is thrown at him. One school morning he fakes an illness convincingly to his loving but simple-minded parents and convinces them to let him stay home. He enlist the help of his hypochondriac best friend Cameron, (Alan Ruck) working together they con their high school principle Ed Rooney (Jeffery Jones) into excusing Ferris's girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) from class. The three of them, plus a priceless Ferrari, which happens to be owned by Cameron's short-tempered father, embark on a downtown Chicago adventure. <br /> <br />We come to realize that Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron might not get away with playing hooky. Ferris's sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), is determined to prove that Ferris is faking sick and make him pay for it, while Rooney does not want his reputation tarnished, he knows that Ferris has got something up his sleeve. What we get is a hilarious comedy that is well acted, well written, and confidently directed. <br /> <br />What is remembered in this story is the characters; they all have personalities that every person can identify with, the \\"know it all\\" teen, the uptight friend, the angry sister, the simple-minded parents, and the incompetent but determined principle. All the characters are complete opposites and Hughes compounds each element of personality real well. The writing is certainly not forgettable; it is still quoted today in high schools especially during role call. \\" Bueller...Bueller...Bueller?\\" <br /> <br />What happens to the audience is that a form of sophistical pleasure evolves from the film; they know it's wrong what Ferris is doing, but they can't help themselves laugh in what he is accomplishing. This credits to good filmmaking, and any age group can enjoy Ferris Bueller's day off. No matter if you're 12 or 60 this story will affect you in someway, and most of the audience will see it differently just like the characters in the film. <br /> <br />In today's teen comedies, teenagers are likely getting drunk, breaking laws, or doing wrong things with pies. What emerges in Ferris Bueller's day off is a hilarious plus emotional experience about life, watch carefully the surprising scene of Cameron's character going through a phase where he has to prove that he stands for something, also from the scene is typical John Hughes humor that is blended perfectly. Hughes proves that teen comedies don't have to be idiotic.
B000009PNY|3.0|LIKE MANY TRIBUTE ALBUMS THEY ARE UNEVEN OR JUST SUCK CUZ THE BANDS ARE ALL UNKNOWN GARAGE BANDS. I FEEL THAT A TRIBUTE ALBUM SHOULD BE AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL RECORDING IF NOT BETTER THEN THEN ORIGINAL. SOME OF THESE BANDS KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK AND OTHERS JUST STRIKE OUT.  HERE IS MY QUICK SUM UP. <br /> <br />         <br />1. Never Let Me Down Again - Smashing Pumpkins (THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS CD, AND WORTH EVERY PENNY JUST FOR THIS SONG)  <br />2. Fly On A Windshield - God Lives Underwater (IT'S NOT BAD, BUT IT'S NOT GOOD EITHER. IT'S TOLERABLE.) <br />3. Enjoy The Silence - Failure  (A STAND OUT HIT, IT DID JUSTICE TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION) <br />4. World In My Eyes - The Cure (I EXPECTED MORE FROM THEM, BUT A 3 STAR RATING FOR THIS SONG) <br />5. Policy Of Truth - Dishwalla (THIS BAND SURPRISED ME, THEY REALLY KICKED ASS ON THIS PIECE OF WORK) <br />6. Somebody - Veruca Salt (IT'S OK, A LIL ABOVE AVERAGE, BUT I DOUBT IT WOULD BE ANYONE FAV. SONG COMPARE TO THE REST OF THEM)   <br />7. Everything Counts - Meat Beat Manifesto (I FIND THIS SONG ANNOYING COMING FROM THEM) <br />8. Shake The Disease - Hooverphonic (IT'S A BIT ADDICTING, ONE OF THOSE TYPE THAT YOU CANT GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD) <br />9. Master And Servant - Locust (BORING, WAKE ME UP WHEN IT'S OVER)  <br />10. Shame - Self (ANOTHER SUCK ASS SONG) <br />11. Black Celebration - Monster Magnet (I HATE THIS BAND, BUT FOR ONCE THEY GOT IT RIGHT)   <br />12. Waiting For The Night - Rabbit In The Moon (I RATHER BE KICKED IN THE BALLS THEN TO LISTEN TO THERE VERSION OF THIS SONG)  <br />13. I Feel For You - Apollo Four Forty (ANOTHER CRAPY BAND MESSING UP A GREAT SONG. WHY DO THEY EVEN BOTHER???)  <br />14. Monument - Gus Gus (I HATE THIS SONG TOO, LOOKS LIKE ALL THE A MATERIAL IS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE CD.) <br />15. To Have And To Hold - Deftones (FINALLY A GOOD SONG, IT'S IT'S LOUD, IT'S GRITTY, IT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM THIS BAND.) <br />16. Stripped - Rammstein (THE ONLY ENGLISH SONG THEY HAVE EVERY CAME OUT WITH, AND IT BETTER THEN THE ORIGINAL) <br /> <br />I BOUGHT THIS CD TWICE, SO IN MY BOOK IT'S WORTH BUYING IT. BUT AS I SAID BEFORE, 1/2 OF IT IS GREAT THE OTHER 1/2 SUCKS. BUT IF YOU CAN DEAL WITH THAT THEN GO FOR IT.    <br />
B000E97HIA|5.0|If you put Britney down as talented then you ahve to be 12. Plz this album rox my sox and I'm not no Intern. I havn't been a die hard prince fan since I was 16 because I was branching out to other music and I was like o great another Prince album when my mom told me. So I was thinking should I buy because it's been 6 years since I actually brought a Prince album I'm 22 now and I love this album top to bttm it's just awesome and the Dance OMFG the dance Is like the song. So if you like a album that has everying in it Funk, R&B, Pop, Blues,a nd rock get this album. If your not a prince fan get this album you'll become one. If your a Prince fan and havn't listened to him in a long time like myself GET THIS ALBUM. <br /> <br />3121 Is the place to be Trust me.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I've always had a soft spot for Korn, since they were the first heavier band that I ever listened to.  I was the most loyal fan you'd find, through 'Korn' to 'Issues'.  My disappointed for the band began with Untouchables.  Now don't get me wrong, it was a nice addition to the collection, but it lacked feeling.  It didn't deliver the same bang as the other releases.  Then we got Take a Look in the Mirror.  Talk about slitting your wrists, musically speaking.  This album was what I thought would be the downfall of Korn...the end, that's it, done.   <br /> <br />That is until they released their Greatest Hits...I began having a bias against the band - I wasn't sure whether or not I had grown out of the band, or simply just realized the music was crap.  But the Greatest Hits brought 'Word Up' (a Cameo cover song) and 'Another Brick in the Wall' (needless to say, the Pink Floyd classic).  When I heard these renditions, I realized Korn had something still in them...but they made it quite evident that they had to take a new direction.  After hearing 'Word Up' I realized they could pull off commercial pop music, and get away with it. <br /> <br />So now I had a little bit of hope in me, eagerly awaiting See You on the Other Side...which would make or break my love affair with Korn.  Now at this point, I realized Brian Welch (Head) was leaving the band for Jesus-purposes, and this put doubt in me, but still, I had to give them a chance.  Now I'm not proud of what I did, but to be safe, I downloaded the leaked version of See You on the Other Side (and it's accompanying bonus disc).  Beforehand, I heard Twisted Transistor, the album's first single, and didn't like it much.  Can't say the same about the rest of the album though... Two words; \\"Holy Crap\\".  This album is amazing.  Granted, it's pop-metal, but wow, they really know how to do it.  It's so catchy, yet still has a few signature Korn sounds...So it's like, Korn for the average person.  They've broken their shell. <br/> <br />This is the amazing part - Korn, once a metal band who focussed on depression, suicide and death...is now Korn, the pop-metal band that focusses on generic issues, and creates catchy music that anyone can sing along to.  Like Jesus, I'd give this record to my mom, even my grandma, that's saying a lot! <br /> <br />If you've always wanted to check out Korn, I'd say pick up their self entitled album, then this one, at least see the evolution...Otherwise, just pick this up, because it's a fresh start, and an amazing sound. <br /> <br />I give it five stars, or 11 out of 10.
0785814531|5.0|Few authors (perhaps only Stephen King) have consistently tingled the spine like Master Poe.  While two centuries have passed since his tortured life and twisted pen have graced our old world, his fame has endured, and this inimitable collection reminds us why.  All the great stories are here:  The Tell-Tale Heart, The Pit And the Pendulum, The Cask of Amantillado, The Purloined Letter, The Murders in the Rue Morgue, etc., etc., as well as all of his published poems and even some other of his writings thrown in for good measure.  A must to add to the collection of any bibliophile.
B00005JOIF|3.0|`Munich' starts with a gripping and hauntingly realistic opening sequence about the terrorists attack. The atmospheric film has also some effective moments as thriller, that easily testifies to the fact that Spielberg is one of the greatest storytellers in the world, if not the greatest film director. Still, `Munich' is a failure as thought-provoking drama that it clearly attempts to be. <br /> <br />Ethically questionable, but Hollywood (or any other filmmakers) are certainly entitled to making a thriller out of the real-life tragedy, this case about the shocking deaths of the Israeli athletes. However, you cannot make a film which claims `inspired by the real events' with a clichd plot device like a mysterious French guy `Louis' who sells information like in a spy novel. The assassination team has virtually no trouble in finding out the targets, which is quite unlikely, and though each set-piece is well-constructed, the discerning eye would spot the hackneyed ideas here and there, which are all insult to the intelligence of the audience.  <br /> <br />Yes, I know. The film is based on George Jonas book \\"Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team.\\" As I haven't read the book, I can make no comment on the original source, but judging from the film Spielberg directed, the clandestine team consists of familiar `types' of the characters -- Newly-appointed leader (Eric Bana), trigger happy young male (Daniel Craig), cool and determined veteran (Ciaran Hinds), slightly geeky bomb maker (Mathieu Kassovitz), etc. Luckily the superb acting from the supports (not the lead) such as Ciaran Hinds and Hanns Zischler saves the film's main characters from stereotypes. <br /> <br />As to Eric Bana, though he is no doubt a very talented actor, he was disappointing. Eric Bana plays Avner the leader of the team, who has a pregnant wife at home. I would choose a single, unmarried male for doing such a very dangerous job like assassination, but Spielberg must have thought otherwise. Anyway, Bana's Avner is only a boring presence beside the more authentic and nuanced acting from Hines and Geoffrey Rush, and Avner's changing attitudes to the cause of the mission and his identity are barely credible but predictable. <br /> <br />I know some people (who noticed the WTC in the film's New York scenes) argue that the subject matter of terrorism and revenge is very immediate to us. I agree. But still I firmly believe that it is hard for that immediacy to co-exist with the film's entertainment value as thriller which is considerable. Now I come back to the film's great opening and three flashbacks showing what happened to the victims, of which effects are just terrifying because we know the terrible accounts are true. However, for all the insistence to the realism of Spielberg, the following story about the counter-terrorism team lacks the authentic voice of them.
0553801503|4.0|Obviously no one in their right minds is going to begin reading a multi-thousand page opus on book 4 - so any review will have to be made based on a fan's eye view. Yes the book was split in two, yes many favorite characters were left out till next time and yes no real progress was made plot-wise. On the other hand it still was full of cracker-jack writing, tense moments and is deserving of a read. Consider it an \\"appetizer\\" to whet your appetite until book 5 (early 2007).
B000026X5A|5.0|These songs are no less than majestic, lyrically and melodically. The singing and playing are equally impressive and convey the various moods of the album so well. The ecstasy, the joy and the sadness of life are captured here with an honesty very rarely matched in the history of rock.<br /><br />The Ties That Bind, Sherry Darling and Hungry Heart are passionate rockers, while Independence Day is a mournful ballad full of memories and regret. Point Black is a slow ballad, whilst Cadillac Ranch and I'm A Rocker are blistering slabs of energetic rock. Fade Away is a slow and anguished ballad with beautiful piano work and a stirring arrangement, while the sad and fragile Stolen Car almost sounds like something from Nebraska.<br /><br />Traditional rock `n roll rears its pulsating head on Ramrod, while the next three songs all have cars and driving as their theme: The Price You Pay is sombre and melancholic, Drive All Night sad and soulful, and this masterpiece of an album concludes with the sorrowful Wreck On The Highway, one of Springsteen's most moving songs. In its dignified resignation, acceptance and the renewed appreciation for loved ones that it inspires it reminds me of Lou Reed's The Bed or Song For My Father by The Angels Of Light.<br /><br />The River is such a great album that it's almost too much to digest all these wonderful songs in one uninterrupted listening session.
B00006M183|5.0|To say that Riot Act is a \\"flat\\" album is a tremendously ignorant statement to make.  Pearl Jam, as always re-invents themselves without changing their identity... when you hear it, you know its pearl jam just by the tone and the vibe.  The re-invention to me felt much like an \\"art-rock\\" approach (for lack of better word), Matt Cameron's song, \\"You Are\\" is possibly one of the best songs Pearl Jam has ever written.  Cropduster is deep, full of concept, and uses engenius guitar tone & texture.  Stone Gossard's \\"All or None\\" is a particularly moving song, lyrics & chord progression make this song the kind that I play over and over again. <br />I give this album 5 stars because it demonstrates Pearl Jam's amazing ability to do something new with their sound while still retaining their signiture approach.  They're an amazing group of musician's that set quite an example!
B000AARKOO|3.0|Kingdom of heaven is a wonderful exercise in fantacy. Ridley Scott has made a good movie about what he thinks should be the role of a knight and has chosen a figure from history to mold the clay of the character. The Technical aspects of this movie were a marvel down to the last detail, the acting was superb with solid performances from supporting cast and main actors alike.  this would have made a great story if it were true...it is not historically accurate.  If one takes all the time to make sure that the armor is historically accurate and that the events show a period accuracy why not tell the real story... well, because Knights of a code were an Ideal to be strived for... not part of reality.  Had this been about a knight of fiction and the events steaped in myth I would have rated this movie a 4 or 5. I like my history as it is, not well stired and doctored with spice.

We decided not to continue in a straight setting as the movie stars in this movie did, we divorced and lived happily ever after-32 years now. Our prospective families and children love us both. No regret,no mistake! We made the right choice and the movie is the right choice!!!!Unlike hiding love and loosing that love without resolution as in the movie, we will be buried together and God loves us too. I don't think I'll see people who hate and judge (as only God is impowered to do} in heaven. Buy the movie,open your eyes, you MIGHT JUST GROW IN LIFE!

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is the kind of movie that stays with you long after you have stopped viewing it. Ennis and Jack, the two main characters, are thrown together in the summer of '63, tending to sheep on Brokeback Mountain. One thing leads to another and both are forever changed. I know some have completely oversimplified this movie as a \\"gay cowboy\\" movie, but that is so far from the core of it. BBM is a love story, an epic one, which has never been done in gay themed movies (usually movies with gay characters as the focal point do not span anywhere near 20 years). It deservingly is the most acclaimed film of the year and should've been named best picture of the year by the academy, but who cares what they think. The performances are amazing. Heath Ledger is breathtaking. He totally became Ennis Del Mar. The same can be said for Jake Gyllenhaal, who is brilliant as Jack Twist. The supporting cast is also great. I would recommend this movie to anyone, not just fellow members of the gay community, but those who enjoy a movie that is heartbreakingly beautiful and will move you to tears.

I then found out that I had missed the first season, so I ordered it and am now completely caught up on the background of the show. I work as a nurse in a general hospital and deal with residents everyday. I can tell you that residency is no picnic and they tend to \\"hang\\" together just like on the show.  <br />This is probably one of the best series I have seen in many, many years!

0375760067|5.0|The first book I read out of Thomas Hardy's many works was \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" back in my secondary school days. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. Reading \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" only confirmed that my liking for Hardy's works was not misplaced. The Mayor of Casterbridge is absolutely brilliant as the author uses his perceptive insights into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalities. For example, Henchard is an alcoholic who suffers from many of the accompanying afflictions that include low self-esteem, shame, guilt, self-castigation, self-punishment, loneliness, a death wish, and a tendency to depression.<br /><br />The book starts in the first chapter with a dramatic masterpiece that perfectly sets the tone and theme for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work. They go to a country fair where Henchard, an alcoholic, gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Once Henchard sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family. Abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life.  The story unravels nineteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, Henchard who was now the Mayor of Casterbridge falls from grace, this being a result of his own character flaws and the hand of fate.<br /><br />I enjoy reading Hardy's impressive prose, which is strong, sharp and descriptive. The various scenes the author describes are filled with vivid and compelling imagery that leave one wanting to read more and more. Thomas Hardy is especially adept at describing the environment which he has a deep seated love for. The ironic twists of fate provide a setting that demonstrates the brilliant writer that Hardy is where he expertly weaves a plot that shows the themes of the balance between fate and individual choice. That makes The Mayor of Casterbridge very pleasant to read despite the sad story.<br /><br />For those who wish to study English Literature, The Mayor of Casterbridge is on the top of the recommended list. The book provides exceptional descriptions of England and its culture as well as exposing the student to themes of profound gravity and importance. The book provides clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy. It is well-written, is easy-to-understand and to follow.the themes of the balance between fate and individual choice.

B000002UA9|5.0|The world changed forever in 1963 with the explosion of Beatlemania and the ensuing British invasion. Almost instantly the Beatles become the world's most popular band, releasing critical and commercial smashes throughout the decade. The Beatles debut \\"Please Please Me\\" (1963) is the album where it all began.<br /><br />Is \\"Please Please Me\\" the Beatles best album? No. Compared to such classics as \\"Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" (1967) \\"The Beatles\\" aka \\"The White Album,\\" (1968) and \\"Abbey Road\\" (1969) among others, \\"Please Please Me\\" seems trite and one-dimensional by comparison. But as the saying goes, Rome wasn't built in a day. The Beatles had to start somewhere. And while the Beatles later work is in most regards superior, the output of the Beatles early albums has much to offer.<br /><br />Some detractors have commented that the Beatles were a \\"boy-band\\" of their day. This is somewhat accurate in a superficial sense. Their music was infectious, poppy, and radio-friendly, the girls screamed and their image was pretty clean-cut. But unlike, say INSYNC or the Backsteet Boys, the Beatles actually played all their own instruments and wrote a lot of their own material. And while about half of their songs early on were written by other people, they weren't written by professional hit-makers, they were written by artists that the band loved. But the biggest difference between the Beatles and later-day boy bands is that the Beatles wrote and covered authentic rock n' roll songs. Everything about the early Beatles was authentic, sincere, and organic. \\"Please Please Me\\" and the Beatles other early records wasn't mass-produced schmaltz, it was something real.<br /><br />Part of the charm of \\"Please Please Me\\" is its nativity. Released in 1963, the 50s was just a glance away in the rearview mirror. The real 60s, with all its turbulence, activism, protests, and social progression, had not yet begun. \\"Please Please Me\\" reflects the era of innocence in which it was released.<br /><br />While the technical and studio wizardry of the Beatles later work is undeniably groundbreaking and impressive, there is much to appreciate and enjoy from the organic meat-and-potatoes early albums. For the classic rock purist, it doesn't get much better than this. Being that there was so much hype and frenzy at the time of Beatlemania, and that so much has been written about the band since, it's easy to forget what all the hype was about; a really great rock n' roll band. Rooted in the gritty rock of the 1950s, the Beatles took the R&B based formula of such greats as Chuck Berry and Wilson Picket, and molded a sound of their own. The Beatles carefully and meticulously crafted songs that were infectious, melodic and full of lush harmonies. One of the great things about these early albums is how organic they sound. They just sound like four guys playing live in the studio, without a lot of overdubs, doing what they are do best.<br /><br />The chemistry of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr was, pardon the tired clich&eacute;, magic. When these four went into the studio together and made music, there was just something wholly unique and special about it. The sound of the Beatles was pure, fresh, and it just made you feel good. It's no small wonder why even the worst of the Beatles is still better than 90 percent of what has been popular ever since.<br /><br />While much of \\"Please Please Me\\" are cover songs, unless you look at the credits, it's hard to know which are covers and which are original compositions, as the Beatles had a way of making anyone else's song their own. And while later-day Lennon/McCartney songs were written, more or less, by one or the other, on these early albums, collaboration between the two is more apparent. Even at a very early age, on their first album, the pop-craftsmanship of the two shines bright with such classic songs as \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"Love Me Do.\\"<br /><br />There are some bands where all you really need is the \\"greatest hits\\" or where you need only a few essentials, there are some bands, however, where you need to buy the entire catalogue, and the Beatles are one of those bands. While \\"Please Please Me\\" may not be their best work, it's still a classic album that offers some of the best compositions and covers of early 60s pop.here are some bands where all you really need is the \\"greatest hits\\" or where you need only a few essentials, there are some bands, however, where you need to buy the entire catalogue, and the Beatles are one of those bands.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|I first watched this superb film on a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to buy the DVD. What a good buy.<br /><br /> \\"Jarhead\\" is a film directed by Oscar winning Sam Mendes. It is about a US Martine Unit that participated in the first Gulf War. It shows the hard, intense training that takes place before armed conflict, particularly for those who make it to the US Marines. However, after the training and after more training, there is a long period waiting for action whilst politicians try to make up their minds about whether on not they should embark on this particular war. For guys that are roaring for action, this is a period of utter and intense boredom.<br /><br />The US Marine Unit arrived for duty in Kuwait and waited for hostilities to commence. During this long and boring period of waiting, soldiers engage in all sorts of things like watching dirty films and trying to create some sort of fun in the hot and desolate desert environment.<br /><br />Finally the war breaks out. This is accompanied by intense fear that Saddam Hussein's troops might use chemical weapons. After all, the Iraq leader had used it with devastating results against his people. Happily for the Marines, Saddam wisely decided not to use the weapons. However, Iraq troops unexpectedly and inexplicably set oil wells on fire creating an inferno which is like hell on earth.<br /><br />This is an interesting film based on the military memoirs of former marine Anthony Swofford. The film is essentially highlighting an anti-war message. This then makes it more than just a film about a specific war but rather has a message about all wars which share a lot in common, particularly their ultimate futility with no winner but lots of suffering by innocent civilians and wanton destruction of property.

B00005NGZX|5.0|This album one of the most brutal hardcore/metalcore albums of all time! Jacob Bannan doesn't even sound human. He literally sounds like he's in hell. And Kurt Ballou sounds like a psychotic combination of Kerry King and Greg Ginn. To say this band is the modern Black Flag or Minor Threat (I've heard people call Converge both) is to miss the point. 10 years from now, some hotshot band will be called the modern Converge. These guys have come up with and continue to develop a totally original sound. How anybody can say they sound like the Dillinger Escape Plan is beyond me (that said, D.E.P. is just as strong a band, just in their own way). Nobody sounds like Converge. Nobody!

B00000J7J4|4.0|After a long downhill run beginning in the 80's, Santana came back with unbelievable force into the music mainstream with the 1999 release Supernatural.  The album gave the band numerous Grammy Awards, and A LOT of recognition and a sort of rebirth of interest in the classic Santana songs.   <br />Supernatural is the first of three albums in which Santana collaborates with numerous artists.  Being the first, it was somewhat revolutionary and very creative at the time.  However, it's sequels Shaman and All That I Am have overused the concept of making duets with other artists. <br />The music of Supernatural is mixed.  The best songs are the ones performed by the Santana band by itself.  Da Le (Ya Leo) is one of the best in the whole album, along with Migra and Africa Mamba.  <br />Corazon Espinado, Put Your Lights On, The Calling, and Do You Like The Way are some of the best collaborations with other artists.   <br />Some songs are way too radio friendly, counting more as pop than classic Santana. (e.g. Smooth, Maria Maria.)   <br />Overall, this album is recommended.  Carlos soars on guitar and Raul Rekow and Karl Perazzo play percussion masterfully.  Chester Thompson is somewhat dwarfed by everyone else, being seldom heard throughout the album, having almost no keyboard solo's in the songs, and one the keys to a great Santana sound is having a solid keyboardist. <br />
B000E1155E|5.0|I don't know about you but I think there's another British invasion in the works right now. First The Streets took over, Kano, Lady Sovereign; then James Blunt, and now Arctic Monkeys. There are few albums out right now that rock out with this level of passion and dedication. The vocals wail with bittersweet emotion and small-town sincerity, continuing with the renewed spirit of \\"singing with feeling\\" as opposed to \\"singing like it ain't no thang\\". Laced with his distinguished Shefield accent makes his vocals that much better, too.<br /><br />The album is divided into two parts, the first half being notably heavier than the second. I prefer the second half: its mellow, more ambient vibe makes it a nicer listen and better highlights the band's chemistry. Parts 1 & 2, however, are both driven by the groups' insanely talented bassist. Whereas I've noticed a lot of groups of late using the drums as the backbone of their music, the Arctic Monkeys' heart and soul lies in their bass riffs.<br /><br />Rock & roll comes a dime a dozen these days, so this album is a total breath of fresh air. Despite selling more albums in their opening week than any other band in British history - which would alienate most too-cool-for-school listeners right off the bat - this albums deserves your attention and money because they have put together an amazing album free of the kind of bells and whistles that would normally make me sick to my stomach. They have the same effect as The White Stripes do: mega-millions sold yet totally unpretentious and uber-talented. This is the rock & roll of the moment.
020161622X|5.0|The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master, should be read by anyone involved with the software industry. The tone of this book is casual and often humorous making it fun, enjoyable and easy to read.<br /><br />As the title implies, this book is targeted towards the programmer or developer (the construction phase of software engineering). The text outlines principals and practices that are common sense, but that every practitioner SHOULD be aware of. However, in reality most of these principals and practices are overlooked. The book borders on the obvious, but keep in mind that \\"the obvious ... is never seen until someone expresses it simply.\\" (Kahlil Gibran) The authors express good programming principals, outline the collection of tools every practitioner should have, and offer priceless advice in a simple manner.<br /><br />I found the authors offering a lot of \\"Hows\\" and \\"Whats\\" with out answering the \\"Whys\\". [[ASIN:0735619670 Code Complete [Steve McConnell] ]] answers most (if not all) of these questions and in doing so, is three times the size. The Pragmatic Programmer is also somewhat short-lived - a new edition should be in the making. For example the collection of tools described within the text is changing (Subversion seems to be replacing CVS, etc...).<br /><br />It's interesting to note that both authors (Andrew Hunt, David Thomas) are authors of the Agile Manifesto, and have a series of Pragmatic Programming books (Pragmatic AJAX, Agile Web Development with Rails, Programming Ruby, etc...).<br />Their other texts are equally humorous and easy to read.<br /><br />The Pragmatic Programmer makes an excellent prerequisite to [[ASIN:0735619670 Code Complete]]. I can attest the \\"[Pragmatic Programmer] will help you become a better programmer\\" (Preface), but reading additional software engineering resources will make you an even better programmer.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is a beautiful piece of work - a musical and lyrical metaphorical island where man is immortal in the thoughts and dreams of the living, where heaven is found in a spark of existence.  I've just read some of the previous postings that pose as reviews but are actually abusive attacks on Polly Samson who wrote the lion's share of the lyrics both here and on Floyd's Division Bell.  These one-star-ers imply that because she's Gilmour's wife she is somehow unqualified to write.  These people should look beyond such ignorant sexism as she is a professional and published writer of literary fiction and was a high-profile and resected writer in England long before she met and fell in love with Gilmour.  And by the way, John Lennon's best and most interesting work was during the Yoko years but she happened to be female too.  Man meets woman, music meets words - sounds perfect to me and life on this island is sweet and inspiring.

B000002KDG|5.0|Both a soulful unplugged masterpiece which demolishes any Bob Dylan album as well as an electric rocker on par with the intensity of any hard rock created before it or since, Rust Never Sleeps is a thematic and expertly-crafted Neil Young record which is a true testament to the two dominant sides of the eclectic artist's songwriting techniques: the acoustic-playing loner poet and the the frenzied feedback rocker of Crazy Horse. Opening and closing with the same song, albeit with vastly different takes, Rust Never Sleeps starts and stops on the track My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue) and Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black), respectively (or is it the other way around?), one of the most scathing, yet later reassuring commentaries of the rock and roll scene which Young has been so instrumental in forming. These two song(s) set the tone for the amazingly conceptual album which is no less than a study of relevance, love, progress, and getting old. <br /> <br />Young explores all of these topics which become stale in the hands of many uninteresting songwriters with a refreshing vigor, speaking with the wisdom of a man who has seen both the ups and downs of life and is now in a position to freely command both ends of the spectrum and their effect on the human condition. Aside from tackling the tough issue of \\"where is rock and roll going?\\" on the albums title tracks, Young also delves into more personal territory on The Thrasher, an examination not only of his strained relationship with Crosby, Stills, & Nash, but also a metaphor for that thrashing beast known as progress. As society and all its destructive vices such as construction companies and pollution tear across the natural world which has been here long before the human race, people rarely stop and take a breath in this fast-paced world to look around and question what the purpose of all of it is, a topic which Neil is not afraid to confront. The song's ability to speak to the listener and leave it to their own interpretation is beautiful and has since become a lost art in the world of commercial rock. The theme of progress and it's trail of destruction is further touched upon in Pocahontas, a song of sympathy for the tragedy of the American Indian and a brutal description of the cruelties the Europeans have inflicted on North America's natives, in the same vein as Cortez The Killer was used on the Zuma album. <br /> <br />As the album progresses and Neil Young's brilliant acoustic strummings give way to the powerful electricity of Crazy Horse, the subject matter begins to harken back to the days of Tonight's The Night (an album in which Young performed the same reprise effect with the title track(s)), using storytelling to relate the singers view of the popular drug culture of America on Powderfinger and Sedan Delivery, politics not being spared on the rocking Welfare Mothers either. <br /> <br />Crazy Horse is truly in top form here, even though the entire band only appears on the latter half of the album, putting forth an energy and honesty which is rarely matched in the rock world anymore. Young has created some truly amazing and powerful albums over his long and epic career, but in my opinion Rust Never Sleeps ranks above the best, right along with Tonight's The Night, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, and Comes A Time. If you like good, genuine, honest music you would be wise to pick this one up, I can guarantee your complete lack of disappointment.
B00005MP58|5.0|Review of the TV production of 'Pride and Prejudice' starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle<br /><br />I have long been a devotee of Jane Austen's novel and I am always interested in dramatizations of it. This TV production is certainly the best I have seen; and contrasts very favourably, in my opinion, with the film that was recently released.  It is always a challenge to turn a novel into a film, especially when the novelist is as great a wordsmith and stylist as Jane Austen.  How can a dramatization, which must entail the abridgement of the words to a serious extent, succeed in presenting a meaningful interpretation?  And how, in a production aimed at a wide audience, is the apparent gulf between the contemporary viewer and the language of a late 18th/early 19th century novel to be bridged?<br /><br />The most obvious point of contrast between this production and the recent movie lies in its preservation of much of the original dialogue, and hence, not only of the nature and depth of the personalities of the novel, but also of its central theme: the painful and humiliating process of enlightenment which Darcy and Elizabeth must both undergo in order to merit their happiness.  The easy path, followed by the movie, of modernizing (and frequently replacing altogether) Austen's language, is fortunately avoided here.<br /><br />Firth and Ehle bring to their parts a crucial ability to communicate intelligence and depth of feeling, and give us the clear impression that they have thought seriously about the nature of the characters they are playing.  The challenge presented here to Firth as the actor of Darcy lies in the fact that in the novel we are never given Darcy's view of events except in an oblique way.  Firth has clearly endeavoured to create Darcy's own inner narrative - and I find his attempt interesting and convincing.  Whole scenes are added to provide additional insight into the 'missing pieces' of Darcy's personality and experience, and the viewer must make up her mind whether these are successful (the famous 'diving scene' at Pemberley, and the fencing lesson are two major examples).<br /><br />In fact, it is easy to identify differences between Firth's own view of certain scenes and some explicit descriptions in the book.  An important example is the early interaction between the two at Netherfield, where Elizabeth indirectly accuses Darcy of pride.  In the novel, the exchange is conducted at a playful level, and Darcy's growing attraction to Elizabeth is not yet a matter of serious anxiety to him.  In this production, on the other hand, Firth's Darcy is visibly disturbed at his emotional response to her; and the exchange is fraught and intense.  Whether Firth's deviation from the overt intention of the author, here and elsewhere in the production, amounts to any kind of challenge to Austen's own judgment in building the story, or should rather be viewed as a side-effect of translating the story into a visual medium (perhaps that is why it was thought necessary to spell out the birth of Darcy's conflicted passion for Elizabeth in a more obvious way) is an interesting question to consider.  In any case, the quality of Firth's acting ensures that the scene is successful.<br /><br />On the whole, I think the director has done an admirable job of making the novel entertaining for a contemporary audience, and at the same time preserving the essence of Austen's novel.  A clear example of the superiority of this production to the recent movie, is the 'second proposal scene', where Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy.  The scene is plausible and dignified, and the actors understand, and manage to recreate for us, the mixture of restraint and profound emotion, of propriety and daring, that Austen creates on the page.  In the movie, by contrast, the interpretation of the scene is so loosely 'adapted' that nothing is left but a sweet and banal love scene between characters who merely happen to share the names of Austen's characters, and look nice in their period costume.  An adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice' should surely strive to present the novel's inner substance, and not just its outer shell.  By this measure, it is the TV production that succeeds.'s characters, and look nice in their period costume.

How could this miscarriage of justice by omission happen?<br /><br />Many say that Sarah Vaughan was the greatest pure singer of all jazz singers, past or present (And I mean that literally; not the greatest jazz singer,necessarily, but the greatest pure singer who sings or sang jazz).  I wouldn't dispute it; and I'd hold this c.d. up as a good example of that proposition.  Never was there a jazz singer who sang more consistently beautifully than Sassy; and never was there a jazz singer who had a wider range of beautiful tones in her or his singing voice.  Whether in her chest or head voice, she just sounded gorgeous.  And this c.d., recorded in 1954, captured her in her prime.<br /><br />As I listen and re-listen to this, I wonder why the world's finest don't have this on the same level as John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman, or Sinatra's \\"Sings for Only the Lonely\\", or Carmen's \\"Sings Songs of Billie Holiday.\\"  Here are two possibilities:<br /><br />1)  The version of this c.d. I have is not this one, but one released on Comet Records entitled \\"September Song.\\"  The sound is subpar.  The piano sounds tinny; and in this day of sound engineering, there's no excuse for that.  Perhaps the world's finest were listening to the wrong reissue of the album.<br /><br />2)  Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown are about two levels above the other 5-6 musicians on this date.  It's not that they are subpar, by any means; but listen to Clifford's solos on \\"Jim\\" or \\"April in Paris\\", for example, compared with the others; he just takes over the bandstand.  He has a fatness and a richness of sound that is matched on this date only by Ms. Vaughan. In contrast, for example, on the Coltrane-Hartman date, Tyner, Garrison and Jones were every bit the equal of the two principals.<br /><br />Well, whatever the reason, I respectfully disagree.  This is one of the all-time greats from one of the all-time greats, and ought to be in the top 10.  RCyner, Garrison and Jones were every bit the equal of the two principals.    Well, whatever the reason, I respectfully disagree.  This is one of the all-time greats from one of the all-time greats, and ought to be in the top 10.  RC
B00006674X|4.0|HELLO. WITH REGARDS TO THIS MOVIE ( CHANGE OF HABIT ) STARRING ELVIS PRESLEY, IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS WAS ONE OF HIS BEST MOVIES. ALMOST EVERY OTHER MOVIE HAS HIM SINGING REALLY DORKY SONGS. THIS MOVIE WAS NOT BAD. IT ALLOWED HIM TO ACT AND SING SONGS THAT WERE NOT THAT BAD.  <br /> <br />PAUL SUMMERS
B00005JO9J|5.0|I've never been a fan of any tv series... but this one.. uff is THE ONE.. just like Friends... those that you have to follow week by week.  Thanks ABC!

B0000542D2|5.0|I ordered this movie after Christmas, and it came in just in time for my birthday. I loved this movie. I've watched it so many times now. All four were great actors in this movie, and it's really witty. Plus the songs are great. The DVD itself could have been a little better-the behind the scenes features aren't that great, and I found some of them to be sort of boring. Some of the features need to be viewed by PC, and my computer was unable to download the special viewer needed to watch them. So rating on the Movie...5 stars-easily. The DVD..I'd say about 3. (the quality is VERY good though.)

B00005JOE8|5.0|V for Vendetta is giving everyone what they expect, but with a little extra. While you watch, you wonder has this happened before, or is society on the verge of this now. V for Vendetta starts out showing us what the surroundings are like and what kind of monsters the villian has created. Soon after showing this, we get to meet out hero who is only known as V. After the movie's over, you realize V stands for so much more than vendetta. When we meet V, he's so much more intelligent than other heroes. he speaks with alliteration, and a genuine gentleman-like gusto. Once again Hugo Weaving is associated with the Wachowski Brothers from playing Agent Smith in one of Hollywoods biggest trilogies. They only write and produce this gem, why they didn't direct, I haven't the slightest idea. The villain in this movie is only a face projected on a wall sized screen. This man ,played by John Hurt, is so openly a mimic of Hitler, a man the audience already loathes and hates. His name is even Sutler, and he is, like Hitler was, only known by a single name. Through the many rises and falls of the movie, we learn the harsh past of V, and Sutler, and Sutler's sad followers. Sometimes the audience may find V's actions a bit bizzare, and heartless, but this is what breaks this out of the comic book cookie cutter genre that it gets associated with and locked into.  <br /> <br />Natalie Portman is just rolling off the Revenge of the Sith Star Wars pedestal, but instead of taking a step down off her high beam, she gracefully takes a step over. People should recognize her in films of this sort instead of only looking where drama is so often found.  <br /> <br />V for Vendetta is the movie we all wished so many could be. This is another mark hit for the Wachowski Brothers' writing. Without the writing this movie would be dust blowing down Main Street. Step away from Superman, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Daredevil; and step into V for Vendetta and find out why we should all remember, remember the 5th of November.
B000E97HIA|5.0|This is a great new release from Prince.  If I like a cd on the first listen, I know I'm gonna love it by the second and third and onwards.  I did love it from the first listen and now I cannot stop playing it.  I especially love the beautiful ballad Te Amo Corazon.  It's stunning.  The Word is another favourite; this time around it's very hard to pick one stand out favourite because he has totally outdone himself with excellent songs that mostly all have great lyrics and catchy beats.  This is going to be a smash hit cd from Prince.  It's definately his best work in many years and I hope he follows this up with a tour.   <br />Even if you aren't a major (or even minor) Prince fan, this will change your mind if you give it a chance.  It's fantastic.
B000001FN3|5.0|This CD includes intricate details and exact content of Edgar Alan Poe's many stories.  It portrays the stories well, and I am very pleased with the production of this CD.
B000059TEQ|5.0|The picture holds up, that is, you may hate it but it hardly ever looks \\"60s\\" or \\"70s.\\"  Both O'Neal and MacGraw are rather good, I can't imagine what torment Arthur Hiller put Ali MacGraw through to get her to deliver those line readings which, by and large, are pretty appropriate and hardly ever wooden as she usually is in other vehicles.  I femember years later watching the miniseries THE WINDS OF WAR in which she plays Natalie Jastrow and thinking, in retrospect, that Arthur Hiller deserved an Oscar for making her seem like a human being in LOVE STORY.  There's one scene in which she opens an invitation for Oliver's father to his 60th birthday party, a sign she thinks that her father in law might be melting in his opposition to their marriage, and yet she can't make Oliver understand how much this means to her and how very much she wants to go to the party.<br /><br />Instead he coldly forces her to RSVP and say that they won't go.  Her frustration and pain while she's dialing the phone are palpable, real.  PLUS she's dressed exquisitely, in a khaki green miniskirt with a metallic green and black belt that would look perfectly in vogue today.  It's the kind of scene that sticks with you, especially in a movie so universally reviled, a movie that has millions of fans and yet, for others, it seems to have gone down in history as the sappiest and stupidest movie ever made.<br /><br />What is with the actor Walker Reynolds, who plays Ryan O'Neal's best friend and racketball partner?  He's like a blond, somewhat stockier Illya Kuryakin.  The racquetball scenes with the two men in crazily tight white cotton shorts and T-shirts is like something out of a Bruce Weber campaign, and their subsequent shower scene should be frozen forever as a certain kinf of Abercrombie & Fitch porn.  The actor is appealing and yet, apparently, never made another movie before or since.  You wonder why he was even in the picture at all.  (He plays \\"Ray Stratton.\\")  The focus of LOVE STORY is almost entirely on one or the other of the two leads, and Jennifer appears to have no girlfriends at all.  She exists in a cocoon first of forbidden love, and then in a hospital bed, after an interlude of watching Oliver skate in a white cable-knit sweater, then they go out for cocoa, and then he asks her what they should do for the rest of the day, she says, \\"let's go to the hospital.\\"  The two of them stagger in a long shot out of Central Park into a cab.  It really looks as though she's going to die in the snow, her legs crumbling in on themselves like Bambi trying to stand up.  When she made it into the cab I was sighing real relief.  I guess somewhere along the way I started to fall for the two lovers.  Her snotty, tart, foul-mouthed \\"attitude\\" didn't bother me, though it remains startlingly unsaccharine, as though Ruth Gordon should have been playing the part.<br /><br />One more scene deserves admiration, the one in which Ray Milland, having written a check for Ryan O'Neal for $5000, money to secure an abortion for another girl (or so Milland thinks), sits there ruffling his checkbook after his son has left him with the unexpected words, \\"Thank you, Father.\\"  The expressions which play across Milland's bemused, wrinkled old face are priceless.  You can read his thoughts with a radical transparency, it's a tough acting job and he excels for a minute.  Otherwise he's hampered by a script filled with Freudian cliches.RY is almost entirely on one or the other of the two leads, and Jennifer appears to have no girlfriends at all.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is, of all things, not dissimilar to \\"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\\" or \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" in that it casts its spell so deliberately and carefully, you have to pay extra-special attention to it during the set-up.  Some will react with impatience, finding the opening scenes between two taciturn ranch hands meeting and not saying much to each other over a long summer herding sheep in the Wyoming mountains (actually filmed in Canada) too deliberate.  But when the dramatic moments come, they come like a prairie thunderbolt, and you realize with a shock how carefully Ang Lee and his brilliant cast (all sensational, but Ledger and Gyllenhall are iconic) have set up your expectations, have hooked you so throughly that you are hit as if it were a sucker punch.  The longing glances, the quiet moods, the mournful soundtrack, the pristine vistas all contrast with moments where the characters' passions explode--into love, into violence, into heartbreak.  Jack and Ennis' tragedy spills over into the lives of almost everyone they touch, due to societal pressures and the overwhelming suffocation of silent conformity; when, late in the picture, one realizes what his life has been come to and what has been lost, it's a 3-handkerchief moment.  Yes, there's about 1 minute of implied sex--much less explicit than your average PG-13 movie with a male-female couple--but it's the moments before and after the coupling that haunt you: Ledger getting the first kiss of his life, and finally realizing that someone truly loves him; Gyllenhall's amazing tenderness and strength as he tries to corrall a man who's even more resistant than the wild horses and bulls he futilely tries to tame.  Again, this is a movie that fits Ang Lee's oeuvre of charcters at war between their inner passions and desires and a community that encourages conformity and self-denial; it will make you work, and demand much from a filmgoer.  But after a cautiously positive reaction seeing it the first time, I found myself seeing it again and being overwhelmed by its emotional impact, to the point where I actually think/thought about the characters as real people.  Oscars or no, the 22+ organizations that named this the Best Film of 2005 weren't wrong: it wraps around you like a pair of strong arms encased in a warm flannel shirt, and doesn't let go.  This is a love story for the ages.I found myself seeing it again and being overwhelmed by its emotional impact, to the point where I actually think/thought about the characters as real people.

B000E97HIA|5.0|\\"3121\\" is a perfect spring/summer release. It's funky and fun and makes you excited to drive around with the top down, blasting cuts like \\"Lolita,\\" \\"Love\\" or \\"The Word\\" at full volume. <br /> <br />It's obvious that Prince put a great deal of care into crafting these 12 songs, but they feel spontaneous. Nothing seems labored or forced here. \\"3121\\" easily flows from one feel-good track to the next, keeping your toes tapping and your face smiling all the while. Great job, Prince!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I do not pretend to be intellectual and there is no ego involved in this review. I say buy this movie and enjoy it. Forget that it is humorous while still touching on sensitive subjects. You do not even have to enjoy the incredible photography. This is one of the most redeeming films I have seen in thirty years. The movie is a splendid journey into understanding the past while giving hope for the future. It is not often a dog steals the show, but humanity comes out the winner. You will never forget or regret spending the time to watch this movie...repeatedly!
B00000DHRX|5.0|I can't believe those two editorial reviews actually saying the first disc is bland. I love it. It really is from the heart and for the heart. And it really showcases Michael's beautiful voice. I highly recommend this album.
B000002HPT|5.0|Let's face it: everything these guys release is awesome! Dream Theater are a band that produces intense music and this CD is as good a place to start as any. I've decided to review this one because it was the CD that got me into Dream Theater. This CD polarised alot of fans because of the alleged influence of a producer outside of the band but I don't know what the fuss was all about. This is unbelievable music played with precision. It is also alot more song orientated than other DT releases. By that I mean that their virtuoso skills were used to produce great songs rather than musical exercises as they sometimes fall into. In addition, this CD contains the epics \\"New Millenium\\" and \\"Lines in the sand\\" and \\"Trial of Tears\\". There's no turning back once you've heard this stuff!!
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|A wry and funny look at the perennial Chicken Little tale, with a twist and 3-D imagery.  This is a great movie for the kids; mine loved it and it kept their ineterest all the way through.  The look of the movie is much different than you're used to, but it comes out a winning style that is easy on the eyeballs.  Disney has done it again. I am certain that I heard Adam \\"Batman\\" West's voice in there.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Yes...I must admit...I've been a huge SG1 fan for years and I own all the DVD's...but Stargate Atlantis is a stand alone show that will capture your imagination with a great collection of characters and interesting stories.  You will not be sorry when you buy this DVD set, it is worth every penny and you will get endless hours of enjoyment from it....
B000E5N62U|3.0|Sadly, although it's clear Fagen was trying to create another \\"Aja\\" here, it's just another of his post-Steely Dan efforts that lacks creativity or freshness. A disappointment to this faithful Fagen/Steely Dan fan.
0679729895|5.0|If you like short stories you should love Roald Dahl's \\"Tales of the Unexpected\\" I bought this book having already read some of his short stories years ago and read the entire book the next day because I just couldn't put it down. Every story end with a shocking and original twist.
B0002MB7R6|3.0|Despite all the overblown pseudo-scientific propaganda, this film is nonetheless enjoyable, if only for the special effects.  However, it does require suspension of disbelief.  The premise is outlandish, and a great many sequences don't really make sense, but for those who enjoy some over-the-top special effects, it's worth viewing.  Just as one should never look to Hollywood for historical information, the same is true for science; Hollywood is out to sell movies, not educate the public.  So just get some popcorn, settle back, and enjoy this film for what it is.
0307276902|3.0|This is a great book but now we know that all of the facts are not true as described in the book and some are just there to make the book better.  I found it was a fast read though and I read it before I heard that it was not all true.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I have always been a big fan of the play and soundtrack (with the original cast), so I was quite impartial when first watching this movie. At first, I was disappointed that some songs had been cut out (Contact, Christmas Bells) and the plot has been restructured to fit a movie timeline. Some more of the plot makes sense (Mimi and Angel's relationship) while some details have been trimmed out. Regardless, I ended up loving the movie after watching it again.  <br /> <br />The music is great! Rosario Dawson does a superb job as Mimi, and I love the original cast--Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Jesse Martin, etc. The film was filled with such vibrance and life. I loved every part about it!  <br /> <br />I think the reason this has received a few negative reviews, both by people and critics, is because its being compared to the play. I think that filming it gives some tools for the director to expand upon it (like with the scene with Joanne and Mark, \\"Tango Maureen\\") and Columbus really capitalized on this. Yes, its not exactly the play, but I'd argue it achieves the same message. I think this is a wonderful complement to the play, though I'm not sure how those who haven't seen the play would like the movie on it's own.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Closer is a movie about relationships.  The title refers to getting close to someone.  This film takes place over a period time.  It is not apparent from a first watch but you will notice this on a second look.  The screenplay was adapted from Patrick Marber's hit West End Play (I saw it in Los Angeles at the Mark Taper Forum.) <br /> <br />Dan Wolf (Jude Law) is a wannabe writer who is currently writing obits.  One day he is walking down the street when American Alice Ayers (Natalie Portman) crosses the street and is hit by a taxi.  Dan rushes Anna to the hospital and this starts their relationship. <br /> <br />Passage of time, Dan and Alice are now married.  Dan has written a book based on Alice.  He is sent to have his cover picture taken by Anna Cameron (Julia Roberts).  He has an instant connection with her but she resists because he is married. <br /> <br />Passage of time, Dan is surfing in a chat room and pretends to be a woman.  He is chatting up Dr. Larry Bagley (Clive Owen) who is bored at work.  In the end, Larry asks to meet up.  Off the top of his head, Dan agrees to meet Larry at the Aquarium and tells him his name is Anna. <br /> <br />Next day at the Aquarium, Larry finds Anna (she mentioned to Dan that the Aquarium is her favorite place to go and meditate.)  But of course, she has no idea what is going on.  That is until Larry tells her about the chat room.  Anna puts two and two together.  But she likes Larry, so no harm. <br /> <br />Passage of time, Anna is having her first showing of her photographs at a gallery.  She has married Larry.  Dan and Alice show up.  While Dan is chatting up Anna, Larry is with Alice. <br /> <br />Passage of time, Larry has returned from a medical convention to find Anna out of sorts.  It turns out that Dan and Anna have been having an affair ever since the showing.  Simultaneously, Alice finds out about the affair and leaves Dan. <br /> <br />Passage of time, Larry has given into his baser desires and is now frequenting strip clubs and finds Anna performing.  He becomes fixated with her and tries to get her to go home with him but she is still in love with Dan. (This is Natalie's best scene.) <br /> <br />Passage of time, Dan and Anna are on the outs and Dan confronts Larry.  Larry baits Dan and he leaves in a rage.  In the end, Anna returns to Larry but Dan is not so lucky. <br /> <br />The final scene has Dan back at a park by the hospital where he took Anna and finds out one of her secrets. <br /> <br />Mike Nichols is the one of the great directors who has not had a hit in years.  This definitely broke his dry spell.  This film had a definite edge but with a lesser director it would be tawdry, with Nichols it was perfection. <br /> <br />Clive Owen received a long overdue Oscar nomination and should have won (but it was great to see Morgan Freeman finally get his recognition.)  Julia Roberts showed why she is the number one actress working.  Anna is an extremely complex character and she handled every scene with extreme talent.  This was Jude Law's year for roles (he had four films that year) but Dan is not a likeable character so he was greatly overlooked.  Natalie Portman also received an Oscar nomination for her deft work as the quintessential \\"other woman\\". <br /> <br />This is not a film for the prudish or faint of heart.  This is an all out attack on your senses and a lovely attack. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: Music Video - The Blower's Daughter - Haunting in the film but does not stand up as a solo song. <br /> <br />
0385338082|5.0|I love a good chick lit novel every once in a while, and Kinsella never lets me down. Some books are just unbearably bad--flat characters, overdone dialogue, and insufferable narration.  <br /> <br />Although Kinsella's books sometimes harbor these pitfalls, her plots are always so engaging, and this one was no exception. I found myself reading through the night, to get to the end! Its a quick enjoyable read that will have you rooting Emma on. I even found myself bursting into laughter at some points of the book--it was that funny. I highly recommend this for a casual read!
B000980GRU|5.0|Will Smith stars in this funny film about dating and falling in love.  Smith stars as Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens, the \\"Date Doctor\\".  He helps men find dates.  He has been rather successful at his work, as evidenced by the pictures of couples he helped get together hanging on his wall.  Hitch may have finally met his greatest challenge in Albert Brennaman (Kevin James).  Albert is a junior financial offecer who handles the account of heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta).  Albert is desperate to have a relationship with Allegra, so he goes to Hitch for help.    Hitch is skeptical at first, but he decides to try to help him.  This is the beginning of a friendship between Hitch and Albert.  Soon, Albert is going to fancy art galleries and New York Knicks games with Allegra.  Meanwhile, Hitch has found a woman that he likes.  Her name is Sara Melas (Eva Mendes).  She works as a newspaper gossip columnist. Hitch is immediately attracted to her, and the two begin dating.  In the meantime, Sara has seen the photos of Allegra and Albert that have been appearing in the papers.  Intrigued, Sara decides to do some investigationg of her own to find out why a socialite would be dating a junior accountant.    What she finds out doesn't bode well for Hitch.  She finds out that he is indeed the infamous \\"Date Doctor\\".  Feeling hurt and betrayed, she breaks up with Hitch.  But is this really the end for them?  What will happen with Sara and Hitch and Allegra and Albert?    This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite a while.  Will Smith was the perfect choice for the role of Hitch.  His funny disposition really makes the character shine.  Kevin James does an equally outstanding job as the bumbling but lovable Albert.  You can't help but root for him to get the seemingly unattainable \\"trophy girl\\".  Eva Mendes and Amber Valletta are also very good as Sara and Allegra.    I recommend this movie very highly.  I'm a fan of Will Smith's music and movies, and he delivers perhaps hisfinest performance in this movie.  This is the perfect \\"date\\" movie, so if you're looking for something fun to do on date night, put this movie in, relax, and see a really great romantic comedy.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Believe it or not, I was probably one of the few who didn't know about Desperate Housewives during its first season. It wasn't until the First Season DVD's came out that I had a chance to see this show. From the very first episode, I was hooked. I spent that weekend in my room glued to the TV wathcing the entire season. I couldn't turn it off. This show is so fresh and entertaining. The characters are hilarious and the actors are superb. This show deserves all of the critical acclaim that it has recieve. I can't wait for the Second Season to find its way to DVD.

B000A2H812|5.0|This is my new favorite band since I heard them on Fungus, XMRADIO!!! I just ordered all their other cds, but you should start with this one. My friends think I am crazy, but there is something very addictive about this music. Perhaps it is causing brain damage but even without alcohol added, as recommended by Eugene Hutz, it does seem to fix most problems. Check out the web site, [...] they are on tour and see them live if you can for added impact.  'All your sanity and wits will vanish I promise, its only a matter of time'.
B000062YAZ|5.0|i have been listening to slayer for nearly 20 years, and i never get tired of them. this band has staying power. they are raw electric guitar power. the thunder of dave lombardo's double bass drums. the squeal and rip of the double threat of jeff haneman's and kerry king's guitars. the power of tom arya's lyrics and vocals. it's slayer, do i need to say anything more?
B000803PKY|5.0|I spent several hours comparing the sound of my original LP phonograph record of Running on Empty with the CD and two-channel DVD Audio disks included in this package.  I wasn't able to sample the multichannel DVD Audio. <br /> <br />The music and tempo are identical on LP, CD, and DVD-A, but the sound is quite different.  The LP and the CD sound very similar, and are apparently from the same original mixes for these tracks.  However, the 192kHz 24-bit two-channel DVD Audio tracks are apparently a completely new mix, probably made just for this release.  The differences are very interesting: the CD/LP mix at first sounds much clearer and brighter than the DVD-Audio, just the opposite of what I would expect.  Also, in some portions the CD/LP contain reverb of Browne's voice missing on the DVD-Audio.  By direct comparison, many DVD-A vocals at first sound muffled compared to the CD/LP mix. <br /> <br />However, a closer audition reveals that DVD-A often has more content than CD/LP.  For example, a backup vocal barely audible on CD/LP is clear and distinct on DVD-A.  And left-right channel separation is usually better on the DVD-A.  (By the way, many DVD-A tracks also have much more leadin material). <br /> <br />I can only conclude that the originals were recorded with multitrack equipment and the DVD-A is taken from microphones that the original album obscures with material from other tracks.  It sounds to me like the CD/LP uses microphones that recorded sound coming from stage speakers, and the DVD-A favors the musicians' microphones instead.  Also the equalization is probably boosted on the CD/LP to compensate for typical record players of the 1970's, making the sound artificially brighter, but obliterating much detail. <br /> <br />The CD/LP sound is as you may remember it from the radio, the DVD-A sound is quite different.  Browne himself runs a sound studio, and probably had a hand in mixing the DVD-A.  In a recent Stereophile magazine he says the surround DVD-Ais remarkable.  Possibly the two-channel DVD-A is derived from this mix. <br /> <br />So, the two channel DVD-A mix should be regarded is a separate work from the LP/CD.  Therefore, if you're hoping DVD-A is an enhanced version of the original LP/CD mix, you'll be disappointed (as I initially was).  However, the DVD-A, though not as bright sounding, is possibly even better than the LP/CD.  I'm still deciding. <br />

067175274X|4.0|Of the many recollections and diaries of survivors of WWII, none has so captivated the Western literary world as the Diary of Anne Frank.  Published posthumously by her father, this book details the day-to-day experiences of a Jewish girl and her family in Nazi-occupied Holland over several years.  Anne's family hid in the 2nd floor of a store owned by friends.  Anne explains the tribulations and troubles of living as fugitives.  This includes talking to only certain people, turning of the lights at night, not flushing the toilet at certain times, being able to cook only at certain times, and being cooped up in a space too small for her family.  This book also describes the maturation of a girl into a teenage woman under duress.<br /><br />Overall, a good book to read to understand the Nazi occupation of Europe, the plight of Jews, and what war does to civilian populations.
B000EJ9VUW|5.0|If you've been following the career of the Liars (and who hasn't?), you probably know they started out in New York, but recently moved to Berlin.  They also started out playing noisy, angular but funky post-punk on their debut album, \\"They Threw Us All In a Trench and Stuck a Monument On Top.\\"  Album number two, 2004's \\"They Were Wrong, So We Drowned\\" boasted a different rhythm section and created a concept album about the German holiday Walpurgisnacht that was radically...different than the debut.  Vaguely tribal, very arty and noisy all over, it alienated many of their fans, except for those who listen to things like Wolf Eyes for fun.  You know who you are.<br /><br />The new album, \\"Drum's Not Dead,\\" is another sharp left turn into uncharted territory.  The move to Germany seems to have been on purpose; the spirit of Krautrock bands like Can and Faust is all over this album.  On the first listen it seems experimental and willfully \\"difficult,\\" but repeated listens will focus things a bit.  Overall it's a lot quieter than previous efforts--there are moments that recall Sigur Ros and post-\\"Kid A\\" Radiohead.  Not leaving New York totally behind, other possible reference points could be Black Dice, Animal Collective and of course Sonic Youth, so when I say \\"quieter,\\" I don't necessarily mean \\"soft.\\"  Many songs feature Japanese Taiko-style drumming and atmospheric washes of guitar.  Sometimes things get noisy, but nothing that'll get you evicted.  Oh, yeah, and did I mention that it's another concept album?  The \\"story,\\" and I use the term very loosely, revolves around a pair of characters called Mt. Heart Attack and Drum, who represent the yin/yang duality of a person.  The former is stress and self-doubt and the latter is creative energy and productivity, or something like that.  It's actually pretty vague and the album as a whole doesn't have any kind of operatic flow (i.e. overtures and multi-song suites), instead going for a less linear, avant-garde kind of experience.  Of course, with song titles like \\"Be Quiet Mt. Heart Attack\\" and \\"Drum and the Uncomfortable Can,\\" there's obviously something going on.<br /><br />Something like a DVD that comes with the CD, which has the entire album three different times (!), each one containing videos for all the songs.  Whether or not you want to watch all of it is up to you, but you can listen to the album in an optional 5.1 mix, which really made the album come alive for me.  Some of the videos make creative use of animation and even claymation, some use live and in-studio footage, and one seems to be an album-length document of a snail, which confirms that whatever else you can say about Berlin, they must have mind-blowing pot there.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Drum's Not Dead\\" is a firm rebuke to the naysayers who declared the band lacked direction.  If anything, they seem to have dozens of directions, and ambition to match.  If the album's symbology holds any water, I guess that means Drum has beat Mt. Heart Attack.  While I still prefer the noise-rock of the second album, this one is weird 'n' wild enough to choke me up like Jimi Hendrix after an all-night drug binge, and that's no lie.xperience.

B000E6UK5K|1.0|This album has the standard Gilmour formula. Intro guitar Solo + Voice + Outro guitar Solo. All four of them are a spent force as Roger himself put it. Why milk the public with more existentialist crap? Who wants to know awhat a stonking good time Dave is having on an island and he is running scared of the fact that he is going to conk soon. If the Wall was Roger's indulgence in the red, then On an Island is Gilmour's indulgence in the blue. Only difference being Roger's indulgence seems pretty common to humanity across the board and it was bloody good. If you are planning on cutting your wrists, show me the blade, pal.
B000001GQB|5.0|Precision.  That is what comes to my mind when listening to a Karl Bohm interpretation of Mozart.  Mozart's final symphonies are ageless masterpieces of music.  Anyone can recognize the opening Allegro moto of Symphony No. 40 in G-Minor (one of Mozart's only symphonies in a minor key).  Just finding a collection with these wonderful symphonies is a great find. <br /> <br />As to the sound quality, Deutsch Gramophone spent extra time and resources into reissuing these originally analog recordings.  It is nice to be able to hear every woodwind in balance and the string sections in their glory.  The sound does not seem forced or artificial and the quality is absolutely superb. <br /> <br />These recordings were completed during the height of Bohm's time as a conductor.  His interpretations are truly \\"viennese\\" in that tempos and structure are very precise and meticulous.  Some may think his tempi are slow or plodding, but they offer a very nice interpretation that perhaps was accepted in Mozart's era.  The 35th, 39th, and 41st symponies in the set are my favorites. <br /> <br />I would also suggest looking at George Szell's performances with the Cleveland Orchestra, for they offer a different interpretation but are also superb. <br /> <br />
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Man, I figure this album would have had all five star reviews, oh well, you can't [lease all the people all the time. This album is incredibely diverse and technical without being unlistenable and without losing any of this bands infamous brutality. I really can't think of a con to put for this album, OK, they are pretty right wing conservative guys, and Pat O'brien is a giant doucebag, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an amazing album.
B0000669JL|5.0|The undisputed \\"King of Reggae\\". His expansive musical style remains powerful and he demonstrates why he was a musician who was a consummate master of technique and artistry. Each time I listen to this CD I find myself drawn into his  melodies and escorted to a distinctly separate rhythmic demention.   <br />
0307276902|4.0|I found the first part of the book dull not writing in sentences.  I couldn't believe that everything that was in the book was true as I read it because my Son had been in rehabilitation and had an addiction problem longer than the author and didn't go through anything like that nor was he treated like the author.  I also didn't like the fact that he was against AA because that is a tremendous help to alcholics. My Son has helped many people through AA and people should be encouraged to use that program. To bad the book was found out to be full of lies.
B000002JR8|4.0|Mister Nick, don't comment on music when you dunno anything about it. I also really enjoy Avenged Sevenfold, they've got a nice catchy and unique sound all through their 3 albums, even though their music changed alot, I still really enjoy them. They also give one of the best show for low prices still, even if they're now pretty huge... but anyway... <br />Now about Pantera... I personally am not a fan of this band, not my kind of music, but it's far from being musically BAD. Most of Pantera's stuff is 100 times more challenging to play than probably 90% of what you listen to. So PLEASE quit dissing what your sensible ears can't take.  <br /> <br />Oh yeah, Pantera is really far from being what we call extreme music or just Death Metal. In my opinion Pantera's got alot more from 80's hard rock than death metal. So for your further interventions, please have a minimum of knowledge on the subject. <br /> <br />Finally, you should check out Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, Necrophagist or Behemoth... Those are bands associated to Death Metal... a light difference with Pantera no?
B000AGTPUA|1.0|I watched the Polar Express waiting to be blown away by the stellar computer animation and special effects. Instead I found the Polar Express to be an eerily creepy animated film  wherein CGI characters replace human beings with a mannequin-like unnatural quality I found unsettling. The worst animated character was Santa who didn't look very jolly at all, and seemed to scowl and frown for most of his appearance in a stern manner I found unpleasant.<br /><br />At times the computerized nonsense reached a new height of frenzy (such as the hot chocolate scene) which might appeal to children but made me want to reach for the fast-forward button.<br /><br />The only character which I thought seemed natural was the black girl, whose personality and character stole the show.<br /><br />1 star. Huge disappointment. Creepy moppet-like characters, frenzied animation and no plot to speak of. May appeal to really young kids.
0670034711|5.0|I was drawn to the cover of this book in my local bookstore because of its beauty and simplicity.  As I read the jacket and introduction I was intrigued by her idea of spending 4 months in each of 3 countries, thoroughly experiencing what each is known for.  I loved the organization of her writing the 108 + 1 brief chapters as if they were beads on a jupa mala.  Finally, as I began to read the book, I knew that I must own it and read it. <br /> <br />Some people will simply not \\"get\\" this book, I suppose.  As for me, I thought the author wrote very clearly and directly about some complicated and difficult subjects.  The book is indeed a journey, through mind and heart more than time and space. There is a great deal of wisdom in this book, for those who can see it.  People who have found it shallow clearly did not understand it or stay with it long enough. <br /> <br />I loved every minute of reading it.  I felt very good when had I finished, but at the same time I was a little sorry to have come to the end.  I will definitely be recommending it to my friends! <br /> <br />
B000BT97AO|3.0|I love the comic book work that Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean have done together. I think that Mr Punch is one of the best things I've read. So naturally I was interested in Mirrormask. <br /> <br />Well... It looks gorgeous, much of the time, but it's really a Labyrinth rehash. Almost every single plot point was in Labyrinth too. In addition, many of the jokes fall flat. And what sinks the film for me is that there's no sense of urgency; McKean's direction seems to have been focused on what looks good so much that it's detached from its characters. The actors do an adequate job, but the film doesn't seem interested in them. <br /> <br />The DVD's nicely produced, though, and the extras are definitely interesting. Still, I can't really recommend this, except to big fans of the two.
0307276902|5.0|I am blown away, on how much i can relate in this book to my own experience. My child is an addict fot he past 11 years. This is the only book, that i read, that resembles reality of an addict. I would recommend this book to every parent, who is strugling to understand every day is \\"why\\". I do not care about controversy, it is not significant in comparision with the rest of the content. I also heard from addicts, validating similarities with their lives.  <br />I am greatfull to have more understanding after reading this book.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|This was an awesome box set and you can't beat the price. This isn't your everyday drama.. It's witty and smart. The characters are well written and The actors do an AWESOME job. Be prepared to cry,laugh and get very involved in the story... Not only for teens everyone can watch this
0393035158|5.0|Harris gives a provacative and reasoned story on the downside of religions of the world. His arguments supplement and reinforce similar ideas by Bertrand Russell nearly 50 years ago. The chapter on Islam is expecially helpful to understand the threats to the world caused by words written in sacred documents and believed by the faithful. Read this book if you want to understand why many people do not put their trust in religions of the world.
B00000634J|5.0|If you are a fan of music, this is a cd to listen to consistently. It will broden your horizons. John's lyrics just are that way. He's amazing lyrically and an amazing conmposer. The music is just as beautiful as the lyrics. Highly recommended!
B00025ETIW|5.0|I thought IBYMBYBMYL was their ebst, this one wasn't as good, but still great. One of the best CDs i have heard. The entire album is a rock opera.<br /><br />1. Helena: 10/10: A great fast paced opener. The 2nd single off this CD.<br /><br />2. Give 'Em Hell, Kid: 10/10 Very insanely fast paced. I love the lyrics.<br /><br />3. To The End: 10/10: A sad song, but still great. Just gotta love the guitars.<br /><br />4. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison: 10/10: Love this song! I love to rock out to it.<br /><br />5. I'm Not Okay (I Promise): 10/10: Awesome song about the main character in the story apologizing to his wife in heaven. 1st single.<br /><br />6. Ghost Of You: 6/10: Not Bad. Could be better, though. 3rd single.<br /><br />7. The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You: 8/10: I really love this song. Kinda like Hang 'Em High.<br /><br />8. Interlude: N/A: An intermission, dosen't really matter.<br /><br />9. Thank You For The Venom: 10/10: One of the best songs off the CD. I made an FF7 music video for it.<br /><br />10: Hang 'Em High: 1000000/10: My favorite song off of the CD. Reminds me of Squall from FF8. I made an FF8/FFX video for it.<br /><br />11: It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's A F-cking Deathwish: 9/10: one of the best songs. Just love to rock out to it.<br /><br />12. Cemetary Drive: 10/10: I love this song. Just makes me depressed (lol).<br /><br />13. I Never Told You What I do For A Living: 10/10: What a great song. Kind of Tear-jerking. Plus, the last line in the song is the best on any song.<br /><br />Buy this CD today. One of my faves!
0375831002|5.0|I am not going to tell the plot of this book yet again, Amazon and some other reviewers have done it quite well...I will tell you that this is an astounding book, a beautiful book, and a book that I know I will read again and again...... <br />I read a lot, two to three books a week, my family makes fun that I \\"love\\" so many that I read...but in the past few years there have only been a handful of books that when I finish reading the book I sit and try to think of who I can send a copy to, who can I share this wonderful experience with. A book that when I finish, I want to go back to the beginning and start over. <br />I am a little sorry it is listed as a young adult book, I feel that if the bookstores put it in the young adult section, so many people will be missing out on a wonderful experience. Yet it is important that younger readers, high school readers, read this book too. When I was growing up, I remember reading Diary of Anne Frank, and the feelings I had when I read it...and understanding the importance of everyone reading that book. Well, this book is that important, this book is a must read. <br />I am going to go back and read this author's other book, I don't know how it can measure up to this one, but if it is half as good, I am in for a treat.  <br />
B00006EXL5|5.0|MCR's IBYMBYBMYL is the best MCR album yet. MCR are one of the best emo bands out there, alond with Coheed and Cambria and Fall Out Boy.<br /><br />This album is filled with great songs such as \\"Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough For The Two Of Us\\", \\"Drowning Lessons\\", \\"Vampires Will Never Hurt YOu\\" and \\"Headfirst For Halos\\".<br /><br />If you hate MCR, [...] off! MCR are one of my fave bands. If you love this one, get their follow up, \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\".
0060755598|1.0|If you have any basic business intelligence you will find this book will not offer insights or methods that will make a difference to you.  The author consistently uses examples that are too general in business scenarios that apply to only a fraction of the population (\\"pie shops\\", for example).   <br /> <br />I have a professional services company and bought the audio book to listen to while I drive to work, with minimum expectations; I would have been satisfied with even a few insights that could potentially be productive practices for me or my employees.  I was stunned at the absolute lack of any ideas with substance or direction. I have had conversations with students and blue collar workers who are more interesting. <br /> <br />The fact that the author promotes his own consultancy business is comical.  Talk about low hanging fruit...I'd like to get access to that client list for prospecting!
0761129235|3.0|The book is filled with good ideas packaged in a 21st Century manner, but offers little original thought.  Still, it's worth the read and could make a difference in the truly motivated.
B0006213WG|3.0|Sum 41 seemed like they were on a high when they busted out in 2001 with \\"Fat Lip\\" and \\"In Too Deep\\", which in turn resulted in good sales of their second album All Killer No Filler. But when they came back with Does This Look Infected, somehow it wasn't the same effect; they'd kind of turned into just another band. Maybe Deryck and the boys figured that the punk-pop scene was too disposable, which explains why they have a more mature sound on Chuck.<br /><br />This album was released rather quietly (yeah, let's go with that), but it's still pretty above-average. There are still some songs that stay true to the band's original style, though, especially in my favorite song, \\"Pieces\\". But then they experiment with heavier metal-like sounds, too: check out the guitars in \\"No Reason\\" and \\"88\\".<br /><br />But the problem lies in what other reviewers have said: they rely on other bands' ideas too much. \\"There's No Solution\\" sounds like Linkin Park's \\"In the End\\"; and sorry, but \\"I'm Not the One\\" completely rips off Limp Bizkit's \\"My Generation\\". Even \\"Open Your Eyes\\" sounds like their own \\"Hell Song\\".<br /><br />While Chuck didn't really do much sales-wise, it shows that Sum 41 have grown in their music. Let's hope that they start relying more on their own ideas in the future, though, so they can be taken as a serious band again.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
630469654X|1.0|This review is for the DVD only.  The film itself is wonderful, one of my favorites of the whole decade.   <br /> <br />The DVD is two sided (one side is widescreen -the other is standard).  Besides the poor quality of the video (definitely not remastered for DVD), the widescreen aspect is not truly widescreen.  The whole frame is displayed, but when I set my TV's screen size to \\"Natural\\" it shows a standard window (i.e. black bars on the sides produced by the tv) with the widescreen picture in it (i.e. with black bars on the top and bottom produced by the dvd).  So you're essentially watching the widescreen film, fit into a standard frame, in the center of your widescreen tv.  If I set the TV screen size to widescreen (with the widescreen side of the dvd) the picture is stretched horizontally and has black bars on the top and bottom.   <br /> <br />It's such a shame because I love this movie and would like to see it in digital glory.  Guess I'll have to wait til it comes out on HDDVD/BlueRay and hopefully they will fix thisproblem by then.

B00013F35I|5.0|I admit that I'm a Bruce Springsteen fan, but I don't necessarily like all of his music.  I had taped this concert, or at least an edited hour of it, on network television over a year ago.   While I was off for about 2 1/2 weeks over this past Christmas holidays, I reaquainted myself with it.  I watched parts of it over and over even though I had bought 5 concert DVD's that I'd planned to watch over the holidays and hadn't even watched 3 of them.   I thought the concert was great, with the songs being in the same vein as his Tunnel of Love CD, which I really liked.    <br /> <br />While I was watching the Texas - USC game in the Rose Bowl, I mistakenly put this tape in the VCR to record that night's episode of Law and Order.   I was in grief when I realized that I'd recorded over the concert.  I tried a couple of different sources to get another copy of that concert with no luck.   I didn't know the concert was from his tour of The Rising album because I'd never heard the CD.  I checked out a copy of this CD from our public library and saw that it must be, and that Amazon had a concert of this album that was recorded in Barcelona.   I took a chance that this was the concert that I'd recorded and was overjoyed when I found that it was.   <br /> <br />I have Springsteen's Complete Anthology and Concert in New York DVD's, but I like this one way better.  Knowing that many  of the songs are about 9/11 and understanding the context of the lyrics makes the concert even better.  Clarence is in fine form on sax, plus I liked his wife Patti's and sister Soozie's performances.  They all just love the audience going crazy over the concert.  Great concert!
0345457684|3.0|There must be a formula for this kind of book at this point:<br /><br />1. Thematic technology - check (\\"altered carbon\\" refers to storage media implanted in people's brain stem to \\"store\\" their memories and psychic being)<br /><br />2. Noir-ish characters and plot - check (It's Sam Spade meets Ripley meets Johnny Rico in this case, if you can follow that chain of associations)<br /><br />3. Tech based adjectives piled on thick enough to connote culture shock - check<br /><br />4. Virtual Reality - check<br /><br />5. Lots of blood. - check.<br /><br />Okay, it passes muster for Cyberpunk.  Hower, comparing even the seminal books in this ouvre (Gibson, Sterling, etc.) with truly visionary voices in SF, like A.E. Van Gogt or Bradbury, and you begin to realize that Cyberpunk is to really good science fiction what bands like Blink 182 or Sum 41 are to The Clash and The Sex Pistols... a bit of a good thing gone bad.
B00005JO20|5.0|critics criticise the story . but this is an adventure movie and there is a lot of good action. this is not brokeback mountain. thanks god some people like jackson make movies for the big screen if not the cinema would die . <br />sick and tired to hear stupid comments about the length of the movie . and yes the beginning of the movie introducing the caracteres needs it and is not lengthy. <br />as far as the trex scene , this was very exciting to follow unless you suffer add. attention deficit disorder.so could not do any better . much better than the war of the world which was really disapointing and a good adventure movie in the line of what it should be on the big screen. a shoter king kong would have been no story at all. and there is more than kong in the movie and that makes it even more interresting. <br />so thumbs up for jackson. <br />and enough of the boring sml production movie that hollywood is making to believe we should all watch them and nothing more. let us free our imagination and be entertained , not mind analysed all the time .like there arent't enough of the real tv show out there to watch .
B000002UA9|4.0|Geez, can't anyone hear McCartney's count-in that opens the first track, \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\"?  It's \\"one...two...three...five!\\".   <br /> <br />This album is bookended by two of the best rock'n'roll tracks ever recorded:  \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" showing the band in top form on a timeless McCartney classic, and \\"Twist and Shout\\", a cover which blows away the original and features Lennon in top vocal form, and one of the best rock vocals ever recorded.  <br /> <br />In between is a mix of originals and cover tunes, including the excellent \\"Please Please Me\\".  The Beatles were not going to be so bold as to release an album of all original material on their first outing.  But we get a first glimpse of the Beatles, and they were very tight from the get-go, with excellent vocals throughout, both solo and harmony, George's excellent lead guitar, and Lennon's accomplished harmonica parts.   <br /> <br />This did not even give us a hint of what was to come as they grew musically, honed their songwriting skills, and eventually gave up live performance to venture deeper into the possibilities of the recording studio.  But taken on its own, it is an excellent debut album that shows a wide range, from wild rock'n'roll to mellow pop music.
0684833395|5.0|Before writing a book review, I always attempt to determine what the intent of the author was and how successfully the desired effect was achieved.  So what, exactly, is the purpose of Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22?\\" <br /> <br />Is it to provide a biting satire of the reputed leaders of the Armed Forces?  Is it to illustrate the dehumanization of war by a blind bureaucracy?  Is it to entertain us with a dark comedy and clownish, cartoonish figures like Colonel Cathcart?  Is it, perhaps, to parody the excesses and extremes of capitalism and communism through Milo's syndicate?  Is it to illustrate the horrors of war in graphic detail?  Is it to convey the inevitability of death and futility of escaping your ultimate fate?  Or is it simply an exercise in paradoxical reasoning and illogical logic? <br /> <br />The answer, of course, to all of these questions is yes.  Heller has delivered a masterpiece of a novel, one that works on many levels.  His unorthodox methods prove triumphant in the end.  Through light comedy, absurd logic, and haunting flashbacks, Heller presents a war, which may be fought for idealistic purposes, but is executed in an arbitrary and self-defeating manner, whose only glory lies in the odious commanders.  Although this is not an anti-war novel, it certainly criticizes how the war is fought.     <br /> <br />Catch-22 could be divided into two parts.  The first 2/3 of the book provides a circular timeline, as the non-sequitur chapters help to paint a vivid picture of the lives of Yossarian and his comrades.  At first, only minor details are revealed.  As the chapters progress, though, the details are filled in, like an intricate jigsaw puzzle, and the reader is left to ascertain the meanings of earlier, cryptic inferences and allusions.  In these chapters, a light comic mood prevails, interrupted periodically by such accounts as the siege of Bologna.  Indeed, some of the chapters are high-comedy.  If M*A*S*H wasn't inspired by this novel, it sure borrows some of the same comic elements.  However, Heller reminds the reader that there is still a war going on, as death and destruction come into the forefront periodically.  The last 1/3 of the book provides a linear timeline and marches incessantly toward the final climax.  In these chapters, the mood turns much darker and sinister, as the deaths pile up and the humor dissipates.    <br /> <br />Heller provides a portrait of each of Yossarian's comrades in the squadron.  Some, are comical and absurd, such as the enigmatic Major Major, who only allows people inside his office when he is out of the office.  Some are idealistic and sympathetic, such as Clevinger and Nately.  While others are boorish and brutish, such as Colonel (take your pick).  However, the narrative is told from Yossarian's point of view, so, although we are never told specific details about him, the reader can delve into his mind and discover the kind of person he is. <br /> <br />Overall, Heller delivers a masterpiece.  Catch-22 provides an entrancing, enthralling and interweaving narrative of details and ideals that paints a glorious picture of a war-time bureaucracy gone amok.  If you haven't read it yet, please do.  And if you've already read it in high school or college, read it again.
B00006AVRK|4.0|I loved this set!  It is extremely funny and witty.  The British comedy is simply hilarious.  The set focuses on Bertie Wooster, a rich British gentlemen who tends to get himself into sticky situations, only to be rescued by his extremely suave and knowledgable manservant, Jeeves.  The sound and picture quality is good and the menues are easy to use.  I would definitely recommend this set to anyone who is looking for a good laugh.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|One of the best family films I have seen in a while and entertaining for all ages. It also subtly hints at a very enlightening view of environmental ecology that I believe was thought provoking for my kids, while at the same time conveying a positive moral message. Whoever created this film was with no doubt in my mind a philanthrophist.
B00007L4MJ|1.0|I bought a copy of this film, but was disappointed to find that I couldn't watch past chapter 22-23; the image wouldn't play, no matter what I did.  So I bought another.  Same problem.  There's a line across the top of the DVD, so there's likely something wrong with it.  I'm not sure if this is a problem with every disc, but I bought 2 faulty ones.  I hope yours isn't messed up too.  The movie is 5 stars, but I give it 1 star since I couldn't finish the film due to technical problems - there is no excuse for this.

B000E8QVWY|4.0|As it seems that biographical movies are the way to go lately, first Ray, then this movie, I'm not surprised to enjoy and look forward to more. What I was surprised at was how they didn't follow the Ray formula...and just gave us a glimpse of Johnny Cash's life.<br /><br />Yes, you saw tragedy in his youth. Yes, you saw that he was an enlisted man, and yes you met his first wife and children. You saw his falling in love with June, and then, the end. That's it. Nothing else happened?<br /><br />Nods to the actors, although Joaquin Phoenix was a little smaller, size wise, then the original Johnny, he still did wonderfully. And his voice was spooky, that was where they seperated from Ray. Just wish we could have gotten more story. You'll like it though.
B000A6T29E|4.0|I'll rate this UMD 4 stars, as opposed to 5, since it contains just the movie without any special features, bonus material, etc. I'd give it a 4.5 rating if I could. But most UMDs I've seen are this way. It's not a bad thing.<br /><br />However, this is the Director's Cut (so I'm assuming that means you get extra scenes, etc.). Without knowing the original version, I couldn't tell you what's different about it. This version of the movie is only about 95 minutes long.<br /><br />The Warriors was filmed back in 1979 and tells the story of a street gang from Coney Island (\\"The Warriors\\") that spend a night fleeing from every other gang in the city. There are lots of memorable one-liners, gang costumes, and characters.<br /><br />The film is based on a novel that told the story of Greek warriors trapped in Persia that had to fight their way back to their homeland. In the opening minutes of the movie, they explain this, and say: \\"this is a story about courage\\" (or something like that, to paraphrase).<br /><br />I bought this movie because it was relatively well-reviewed (see Rotten Tomatoes). I can see why. It was sort of a cross between a Broadway play and an old-school fight movie. While you don't get the action-per-second and super duper special effects of a modern movie, it was a breath of fresh air to see a film like this. It sort of took me back in time.<br /><br />You should pass on this film if you're expecting something modern and flashy. If you appreciate the Greek analogy, and you want to see a stylistic portrayal of late 70s urban heroes, then you'll want to give this one a try.
B000E97HIA|5.0|3121 does not dissapoint. Not too many things by my baby do. I love the whole CD all the way through. My favorite track is \\"Black Sweat\\". I can only hope he goes on a tour with 3121. Prince is still at the top of his game, so haters hate on. Almost 30 years in the game and STILL better than many artists out now!
B0002IQMKM|4.0|This is a good collection for the casual fan, but Sand in the Vasoline is the better \\"Best of\\" collection. Don't get me wrong, there is a collection of great songs here, but it doesn't have some songs. \\"City of Dreams\\" is a great song and sadly isn't included on this record. Between the two, I'd say \\"Sand\\" is better
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Briefly: Brokeback Mountain is about two men truely in love with eachother. They decide to move in different directions with their lives, knowing that a relationship of this kind is not acceptable in Wyoming(time is 1963). Their lives become consumed with family & work being the proper thing, but still never forgeting eachother. <br /> <br />I believe true love with that special somebody can bring so much more happiness and fulfillment into ones life. For myself this film clearly shows this, and what true love can bring on the flipside. Now that is untouchable! FOOGET ABOUT IT.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|This is my first review here and I decide to write it on this over hyped movie. I thought the plot was non-existant and very lacking in actual comedic substance. The characters were unique and pretty well made up, however they did nothing. I am a big comedy freak, but there is tooooooo much hype on this movie. I would watch a sequel to this just to see what they do to the characters, but this one was a disapointment.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Make no mistake about it, this is a superb piece of work. The entire album glows with a strange moonlit quality that seeps into the psyche with repeated listens. The title track alone is worth the price of admission. Gilmour's solo, particularly the fist solo break, certainly ranks with his best work-focused, lyrical guitar playing at its best.  <br /> <br />This work was obviously a labor of love for D.Gilmour. The dreamy quality to much of the music that is so strangely off-putting to many reviewers, is powerfully evocative of a certain time and place in the man's life. Contrary to many reviewer comments, the lyrics have a poignant, timeless quality that speak volumes if you have the patience to dig beneath the surface.  <br /> <br />As to all the negative reviews, I'm not sure what to say. I'm tempted to go off on a rant but I'll restrain myself. I sense that the bulk of the criticism comes from an inability to view a work by an artist of Gilmour's stature with any objectivity. This music was obviously not intented to be a head-banging affair. Much of Pink Floyd's best work has this same slow, quiet, haunting flow. I'm not sure if I'd characterize 'Echos' or 'The Great Gig in the Sky' as  energetic. <br /> <br />At any rate, if you can't 'get' this music-your loss.
B000002O4X|5.0|The sound track is wonderful to listen too.  As I really enjoyed the movie, I also enjoy the soft sounds of the CD.  Using the various intruments to compose the different melodies, the composition was beautifully developed.
0884271536|5.0|This book was recommended as an optional read for my Project Management Class at Herzing College. This was a great book, but I wish that I had read The Goal first. It is not required, but I think that it would have been helpful. Goldratt's theories appear to be dead on. I wish that I had read this years ago.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem has proven to be the most popular rapper to date, for many reasons, and although it's thought it's because he's white if you really think about it, it's because he's talented.  Eminem happens to be one of the most talented rappers out there because he knows how to rap about matters of importance, always putting in some humor and did I mention that he can flow?  'The Eminem SHow' is the best this guy has ever released, from start to finish squashing any rumors that he won't last or that he's a one trick pony...Eminem proved with this SOLID album that he is and will always be remembered as a rap icon.  Tracks like 'Cleanin Out My Closet' and 'Sing For the Moment' are two powerful singles where Em spills even more blood on the childhood he loathes and in the opener 'White America' he tells off the media, the political parties and call out the racism that made him as famous as he is...I mean come on, it does have to piss off quite a few that a white guy sells more than any other rapper.  'Soldier' and 'Till I Collapse' are probably the strongest songs on the record and really showcase the power behind Eminems words.  'When the music stops' & 'Say Goodbye Hollywood' are Eminems protest's over the downside of fame, and he does this perfectly showing how much it hurts to hate something you love.  Eminem hasn't gone completly serious, he still cuts up on 'Without Me' and 'Superman' sucessfully and then unsucessfully on 'Drips'.  'My Dads Gone Crazy', another funny track, is one of the best tracks here, sporting a chorus sung by his daughter.  This is Eminem's finest hour, and while he fails to impress on one or two tracks ('Drips' and 'Say what you say') he nails every track surounding and still comes out on top!
B000067DNC|5.0|I have watched the DVDs 5 to 10 times and enjoyed them very <br />much.  I plan to purchase seasons 4 thru 7 when I save enough <br />to buy them.  Your service and delivery time were outstanding. <br />  My wish list is building and soon I will be getting more. Again I wish to thank you for the quick response to my order.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie is beautiful in every way possible, from the amazing portrayls of Austen's characters by the actors to the breathtaking scenery. You cannot help but be sucked in by the romance of the movie. Beautifully made, beautifully acted, you cannot help but love it. The movie will definetly leave a smile on your face after you've watched it. Everyone should see this movie it is flawless.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I like this DVD very much. I am very happy with it.....it has many special features on it that make it worth it's asking price, beyond just the movie itself. However, the movie itself, happens to be one of the best ones I have ever seen.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|this is the super stylish, chic original.  a must for a dvd library.
B000002JS6|5.0|Back in Black is one of my top ten all time favorite CDs.  This is what rock should sound like, and Johnson sounds better here, in my opinion, than on any of the later releases (less over the top anyway). Here's my ratings of the songs, in order of my most to least favorites: <br /> <br />Shoot to Thrill, Hells Bells, Back in Black, What Do You Do For Money Honey, Shake a Leg:  10/10 <br /> <br />All other songs: 9/10, except for... <br /> <br />Have A Drink On Me : 6/10 <br /> <br />This has to be one of the greatest 'Drive down the road and crank up the car stereo to' CDs ever!!!  Enjoy!!!
B00009V7ON|4.0|I really like this movie. It says to me that after times of very severe troubles, there is still the possibility of a good life. <br /> <br />The extras show how this movie is made, and they reveal where special effects were used, and in some cases, where the special effects (at least to me) looked seamlessly real. <br /> <br />This movie shows how good an actor Mr. Hanks is. <br />
B00005JOWF|1.0|I didn't expect the film to rise to grandiose heights, but I didn't expect it to be this BAD.  And it's no fault of Milla's, whose scenes with the child that she is protecting actually do evoke an emotional response to the parent in me.<br /><br />However, the rest of it is just plain awful, especially down to our nemesis.  At any moment, I expect one of his subordinates to hesitantly cut in, \\"Sir...ahemmmm...excuse me, sir?  That's not how you wear a nasal strip, sir.  You still snore at night.\\"  Yes, I have a hard time not laughing at the bad guy, especially considering the amount of gratuitous olfactory close-ups that subject us to realizing that there is WIRE MESH on his \\"nose plugs\\" which supposedly keep him safe from harm.  Now that it's said, I need to tap the director on the shoulder in order for him to realize that he could still catch airborne illnesses through HIS MOUTH.  (rolls eyes and hammers desk triumphantly).<br /><br />Perhaps it would have been funnier if our \\"bad guy\\" had more lines with the letter \\"s\\" in it.  \\"Are you inthane?  How thupid are you?\\"<br /><br />Admittedly, the action scenes are incredible, but after about 10 minutes, one gets the impression that Violet is so invulnerable that any action scene involving her lacks the suspense to carry the action forward.  Her role is simply to dance around in a circle in a dazzling array of gunfire that takes everyone out and leaves her unscathed.  Somehow, her concern for her well-being seems entirely misplaced given that taking out 20 guys gives her a good workout and a couple stray stands of hair for \\"injuries.\\"<br /><br />The effects and visuals are also a feast, but there are times it's overdone to the point of annoyance.  The whole scene involving Violet's ever-changing clothes and hair was downright exasperating and the part where the purple sparks dance from eyelid to eyelid almost made me inadvertently laugh--I'm sorry, was this Xanadu?!?  The over-saturated, candy-brilliant colors have been done before, as in \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\", not to mention others.<br /><br />The film starts off with Milla narrating:  \\"I come from a world that you may not understand.\\"  The way she reads the line, one can almost hear it coming across apologetically.<br /><br />Give this film a decided, and earnest, MISS.tain and the World of Tomorrow\\", not to mention others.

B000EGF0B4|5.0|I first saw the preview for Brokeback Mountain while I was in the theater for another movie. After viewing the trailer I felt as though the wind had been knocked out of me, I was so taken aback. Suddenly, I did not want to view the film I had come for but rather longed to see Brokeback. I had already read the short story by Annie Proulx several times and was excited to discover that it was  adapted to film. <br /> <br />The movie was not released for a couple of months, and on its opening day in my town I was one of the first to purchase a ticket to the showing. It was at a small, independent theater; there weren't a lot of seats; the screen wasn't very large; the sound wasn't quite up to par. And yet, the experience of seeing this story come to life on the big screen was so overwhelming it is almost indescribable.  <br /> <br />Larry McMurtry, Diana Ossana, Ang Lee, the incredibly talented cast of actors - including Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger (who gave the performance of a lifetime) - all brought this short story to life in a brilliant way. It was not just the amazing acting, or the fact that the screenwriters could take thirty pages of plot and successfully turn it into a full-length feature film, it was also the breathtaking cinematography: I could almost feel the cool wind against my face, smell the rich dampness of the earth, taste the biting cold of the rushing river. The acting, the directing, the cinematography - all of these things, together with a beautiful original score by Gustavo Santoalalla, produced - what is in my opinion - one of the greatest films ever made. <br /> <br />I have to admit that for days - even weeks - following the initial viewing of the film I was haunted by it. Images slammed in and out of my head like firecrackers, invoking sadness, beauty, emptiness and honesty - emotions on every level, emotions I had not felt for quite some time.  <br /> <br />I have now seen it several times and look forward to its release on DVD. My emotional attachment to this film and to Annie's beautifully succinct love story has not yet worn off. Perhaps we all have our own Brokeback Mountain - tucked away, deep down inside us. Perhaps we push our emotions so far down that nothing can ever penetrate the surface, nothing can really touch us until a movie, or a story, or a simple sunrise suddenly sparks a memory, a feeling. I guess this story has provided that for me. A realization that life hurts, even when you've worked hard to deny it. <br /> <br />The media has so often tossed around the term \\"gay cowboy movie\\" when describing this film. In my opinion it belittles the point. This movie (and the story) embodies so much more than that. It is a stark look into the hollowness of our own existence, and what can happen when we deny ourselves truth. As Ennis so poignantly put it: \\"If you can't fix it you've got to stand it.\\" <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who has the capacity to understand the human condition. And if you aren't one of those people, then perhaps this movie is the key to breaking down barriers and discovering truth and compassion. We all have it within ourselves to love - sometimes we just need a little nudge to bring it forward. <br /> <br />
B00005JOGU|4.0|\\"Capote\\" tells the story of the writing of the author's masterwork, \\"In Cold Blood,\\" which itself narrated the aftermath of the brutal shotgun murders of a Kansas family of four by two drifters in November 1959. Inexplicably drawn to newspaper stories about the murders, writer Truman Capote begins what will become a 4-year odyssey to write about the murders and maybe become/stay famous as a result. Using his reputation as a famous author, as well as his considerable personal charm, Capote works his way past accepted social boundaries. He brazenly walks into the funeral parlor to personally view the corpses of the deceased. Invited into the local sheriff's apartment (via a link to the sheriff's wife, who is also a writer) he manages to make contact with one of the killers, imprisoned (weirdly) in a cell built into the kitchen. By fair means and foul, Capote lies, charms and ingratiates his way into obtaining the material he needs for his book -- all except for the crucial details of what happened on the night of the murders. His continued efforts to keep everyone feeding him sensitive and even damaging information -- while simultaneously reaping the benefits of public adulation -- is creepy in the extreme.<br /><br />Yet Capote is affected by his contact with the townsfolk and with the prisoners. He is tortured by the legal continuances that prevent him from getting closure. His desire to end the book becomes a means in itself, though it means the death of people he has come to care about.<br /><br />\\"Capote\\" teaches a bit about the author's life, but much about his soul. If the film is true to life, Capote was transformed from a man-about-town into a caring human being who was all but destroyed by the experience of writing his book. Given Capote's insouciant reputation in later years, this was one part of the film did not ring true.<br /><br />Still, Philip Seymour Hoffman did a very fine job portraying the author's talent, intelligence, single-mindedness...and duplicity. If anything, his portrayal was rather restrained, given Capote's extravagant persona. Catherine Keener's portrayal of Capote's friend, author Harper Lee, was solid and grounded the movie in reality and a modicum of period social morality. Clifton Collins, Jr. gave a phenomenal performance as erudite, sensitive killer Perry Smith. The film was ensemble work of the highest caliber. I do wish the filmmakers had been bolder about placing Capote in relation to the morality of the late 1950s, which were notoriously less tolerant of rule-benders like Capote than we are today. Had the film been a bit less restrained, it might have been a shoo-in for the \\"Best Movie\\" Oscar.<br /><br />As it is, though, the movie tells a chilling and compelling tale of the writing of one of the 20th century's ground-breaking books. The movie's success can be measured in my visceral lack of interest in reading \\"In Cold Blood\\" in the foreseeable future!d duplicity.

1860498825|3.0|As I began reading, this novel could not have been more involving...what a find. And Waters' ear for language, for dialogue is astonishing, at times. So a great combo: narrative drive and delectable prose.<br /><br />The book was slightly marred for me, though, by its predictable anti-male attitudes. All the men in this book are vicious, weak, or misogynist. (Or all three.) I didn't find this a problem in Waters' two other books, the wonderful Tipping the Velvet and Affinity.
0060977493|4.0|The prose may be a little hard to read but if you stick with this book, you will be rewarded by the end. Roy does an outstanding job in developing the characters and taking you into the children's world. I found myself having to go back to review earlier parts of the book as I read along. She lays out the story not in chronological order, but by the end everything will become clear and the patient reader will be satisfied. I can certainly understand how her style may annoy many readers. As many readers have said you may feel the urge to re-read the whole book after you finish it. 4 stars is a very good rating for me - I rarely give books 5 stars.
0451529065|2.0|The first book I bought was the paperback edition - the print was too small for me to read.  I then purchased the hardback edition - the print was fine on this one.  The overall material is good for a reference since this book is referred to often in the field of evolution.  However, Darwinism is just a theory with no credibility, in light of recent findings in astrophysics and microbiology.  As Darwin says in his own book - if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.  The Big Bang in cosmology, irreducible complexity and DNA information coding in microbiology make Darwin's theroy break down.  I recommend the DVDs Unlocking the Mystery of Life and Journey toward Creation as supplemental material.  Also the book by Michael Denton - Evolution: a Theory in Crisis.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I am truly a \\"Johnny come lately\\" here as I just brought this mini-series and saw for the first time just very recently. I must say that I was totally impressed by the entire series. I have read many hypes about this mini-series. Many have wrote that this mini-series is perhaps the best ever made for TV next to the Band of Brothers. For once, the hype is true. This mini-series traced in twelve parts, the history of the Apollo space progam. The men and women who made it worked, made it happened along with disasters and mishaps. Outside of one episode, all others relating to the Apollo programs appears to have a great deal of historical accuracy.<br /><br />I have read the previous review about the widescreen conversion. I think there's a merit to that but I wasn't thrown off by it that much to make a difference to me. For me, it was the story that totally engrossed me. Another thing I like about this mini-series was that it didn't try to compared with movies like the Right Stuff or Apollo 13 but instead work around these two movies. Thus, if you watch Right Stuff, Apollo 13 and this mini-series, you will have a definite visual understanding as drama can have it, of United States entire space program until the end of the Apollo missions.<br /><br />The mini-series come highly recommend, almost a mandoratory viewing of any Americans who still can take pride in what we can do and accomplished if we put our collective effort into it.

B000001ESJ|5.0|I have to admit to hating Geddy Lee's voice at first.  I even managed to return this record (unheard of those days) after giving the record store owner some bogus story of the vinyl being warped.  Not long after returning the album I somehow ended up with a homemade cassette of 'Kings'.<br /><br />I'd give it a listen from time to time.  Being in the 7th or 8th grade I had plenty of time to listen to music.  It started to grow on me.  Before I knew it I had '2112', 'Fly by Night', Exit Stage Left', and 'Permanent Waves'.<br /><br />The world of Rush is rich.  Rarely does one find this type of devotion to music (and this much expertise).  Neil Peart still manages to amaze me today.  'Kings' is a great place to start your Rush collection.  Don't worry.  You'll want to fill in the collection soon enough with all their other stuff.<br /><br />If you're a fan and don't have this gem why are you waiting?  This is an essential Rush purchase!!

0393327655|5.0|This brave book is clear and explicit about how regligion prevents reasonable solutions to the world's problems.  When an group of people insist on basing their entire world view on a set of unverifiable precepts and calls them 'facts', they are bound to come into conflict with some other group of people who cherish their beliefs with equal fervor.   <br />The crisis in the middle east is but one of a myriad of these conflicts that Mr. Harris mentions.  Every day we have more examples of the ways in which regligion gets in the way of human harmony.   <br />I would heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in exploring ways out of our current religious wars.
B000002P72|5.0|B.B. King was, is, and always will be a helluva performer. Take it from me - I've seen him twice (in his later years, mind you!), and he hasn't failed me yet! This is probably his most popular album, and I'm not surprised why. There are killer cuts aplenty, the best being Sweet Little Angel, How Blue Can You Get, You Upset Me Baby, Worry Worry and Help the Poor. His guitar's at its usual high point. The band is great. Plus, the stories are HILARIOUS!!! If you don't have this album, I don't know where you've been. Rush out, and pick it up. Then get tickets for the next B.B. King concert. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.<br />It's worth noting that B.B. recently retired from touring - damn shame, but come on, the guy was 80 when he stopped. So if you're a fan of the blues and haven't seen the guy live, do the next best thing: buy Live at the Regal.

B000E5N62U|5.0|This is a gorgeous album and proves that DF hasn't lost his magic.  Like a few other reviewers I was bored on the first listen but as many of us know you can't judge a work like this on first impressions!  Listen to the album all the way through about 4-5 times and you'll get what I mean.  This is a TOP-notch band.  Luscious, rich horn parts and vocal harmonies, brilliant lyrics and a timeless concept holding it all together.  This is up there with Donald's very best work but you have to let it work on you for a while first.  Highlights include Donald's conversation with Ray Charles (`if you want that sugar to pour..' - beautiful),  wondering what happened to `that sunny giiiirl we used to knooow..' (Mona),  the bonafide FUNK of Brite Nite Gown (`10 milligrams of Chronax..'),  the 5-note tribute to `IGY' at the conclusion of the Morph reprise (essentially completing Fagen's `trilogy'),  etc, etc.  The only weak numbers (IMO) are H-Gang and Security Joan.  Everything else will grow on you, including the title track, until you are humming it in your sleep.    I saw Donald last night on his Denver tour stop and he performed a couple of these tracks live.  If you get the opportunity, see the show!  This band playing this material live is as close to heaven as some of us will ever get.
0634022296|3.0|I believe this book is a must for any musician or Beatles' fan. The chord diagrams are easy to understand, and even a Beginner can start strumming one of their favorite tunes in just a few hours. <br /> <br />I would have loved a little bit of history about the particular song before going right into the lyrics/chords, but I understand that was not the main focus of the song.  <br /> <br />What I did find lacking was a strumming pattern for each song. Knowing how to strum or slide or bend can make all the difference.

0525948023|3.0|In this book Ekhart expands greatly his previous books with a great increase in words. Yet his message is the same. I enjoyed it to begin with until it became repetitive and concluded with the re incarnation theory.i.e. the soul finding another body after death. He  sets himself up by making statements like this without any evidence  Or his statement the purpose of life is to awaken. So many words to try to get across something simple. So much promised at the start of the book like all the enlightenment books. Another disappointment in the end but better than his previous attempts.
B00005JLEU|5.0|A poignant tale of a young girl discovering her inner strength and courage. Funny, detailed, touching, spiritual, beautiful; all these describe this movie. The story has so much depth and is so beautifully animated, you don't mind watching it over and over, and indeed you have to. The behind-the-scenes look and interview with the Hayao Miyazaki are also informative and interesting. Highly recommend this and all of the Master's work. Inspired and inspiring.
B00000ILDF|4.0|The film starts out just as good as the previous two. The atmosphere is great, claustrophobic, and isolated. The practical Alien effects are excellent, but during the last 30 minutes, there are many shots of the Alien in digitized form, and they look really fake and cheesy, and they really start to ruin the mood of the story. If you could remove all of the digitized Alien effects, you would have a much more exciting and genuine film here. Also, the last shot of Ripley falling into the pit of fire looks really fake, it seemed to me that she should have been enveloped in the flame much earlier which would have made the special effects in that sequence successful.<br /><br />After watching the movie, I felt a little ripped off that there is only ONE Alien in the whole film. There was also a huge plot hole which bugged me through the majority: Why does it take so long for the Alien inside Ripley to birth, when she was obviously infected well before the dog, whose Alien birthed quite rapidly?<br /><br />It's not a horrible film at all, the atmosphere, mystery, and terror is all there, but the cheesy computer effects force this entry in the Alien series to be known as the worst of the four.<br /><br />THE DVD (non-collector's edition): There is a short documentary shot before the release in 1992 which is not very informative, but is still worth a viewing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As the title states that is the truth.  I, like many did not even know this show existed until the movie Serenity came out.  When I saw the movie and I told a friend of mine he said you if you liked Serenity then you must buy the DVD set Firefly.  I did and loved every single episode.   <br /> <br />I can't really highly recommend it or say more than everyone else has said already about the show.   It is one of my favorites of all time and could never get tired of watching it.  It has such an appeal and you can relate to every character in many ways.  It is the best.   <br /> <br />Well?  What are you waiting for?  Buy the DVD set now!
B000002KMY|5.0|Now THIS is 'metal done right' from the heyday of truly great world-class hard rock/metal.  Heavy, bombastic, plodding, gritty, dark, impending doom only as Black Sabbath can deliver.  Everyone else is a pale substitute.  Ungodly riffing and emotive lead guitar excursions by the 'high priest' of metal guitar himself, Tony Iommi.  At age 44, I still listen to this masterpiece a quarter of a century after it was released with my jaw agape.  Talk about 'standing the test of time'!  Long live Black Sabbath!
0140120416|4.0|I'm using this text to teach a first semester Russian course. I chose it in preference to a much more expensive standard text. My library includes at least a dozen Russian books meant for the beginner, and I think this one is the best. The vocabulary is useful (with a few exceptions - the complications of the Russian word for \\"Welshman\\" aren't even of remote importance to me), the order of presentation makes very good sense, and we don't dwell on minor points of grammar until the larger points are dispatched.<br /><br />The book has some deficiencies as a primary textbook, e.g., not a very wide variety of exercises, a lack of charts to summarize cases for nouns, adjectives, possessive pronouns, etc., but I've managed easily (and cheaply) to compensate for those with handouts. My students find it to be a generally friendly, understandable text. It doesn't make Russian easy (nothing can do that), but it does make it seem learnable. The author displays a wry sense of humor (\\"The grammar or Russian numerals has other intriguing complications.\\" At that point one of my students nearly wept) to go with his command of the subject matter.<br /><br />I don't care for the author's pronunciation guidance - his English accent is obviously far from our Louisiana-Texas drawl. I think an American student would be well advised to buy some tapes for beginners and not rely on this book to learn correct pronunciation. But that's a minor point. If I were trying to teach myself Russian (which thankfully I did not), this would be the book I'd choose. It gives a lot of bang for the buck.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|While the story diverts from that of the book, it is addicting to listen to. Kristin Chenoweth makes a perfect Glinda and Idina Menzel is just \\"wonderful\\". Just listen to this CD you can almost envision the expression on their faces.
B00005JMX6|1.0|It was a while ago, but somebody came up with a painting that contained everything Americans like about art.  The painting, as you would expect, is horrid (i.e. animals, little kids, sunsets, etc. all thrown into a jumble.) Well, this movie is just like that painting.  It's got all the stuff folks are supposed to like about teen movies, but it's an incoherent, idiotic mess full of horribly, uninteresting and cliched characters.  Go watch Risky Business, even it's for the tenth time.

B000EGDC14|5.0|Good joyous goodness they've created another excellent album.  Alison and Will, just keep pumping out these babies and we can be distracted from all the tripe out there.  And in an odd way, I'm actually glad there's that idiotic mp3 revolution.  As an audiophile who considers Alexis Park during CES to be heaven (with different degrees, of course), I recognize that it's forced labels to put a lot more effort into releases.  Hopefully the same thing eventually happens with the film industry and they get off their butts and adopt Maxivision 48, but I digress.  This is one such release that makes itself well worth the purchase.  Even the 16/48 LPCM stereo studio mix is a big deal compared to the Red Book disk.  There are also no transmission restrictions on it, so you can send it to an external DAC/Receiver with zero problems.  The downside is only that the original mix was a bit heavy on the infrasonic end compared to the CD master, but Red Book simply lacks the refinement of what they had in the studio.  On extended-range speakers the studio LPCM sounds better.  I would imagine the Koss electrostatic and my ER-4S would also work well.  The CD (and the singles) are good matches for warmer \\"dynamic\\" headphones where the LPCM DVD mix's extreme low-low end can be excessive.  And Mikey Stent, YOU STILL THE MAN.  Nice to also see Dave Bascombe contributing on Number 1.<br /><br />The tracks that hit me hard right now:<br /><br />Ride A White Horse<br />Fly Me Away<br />Time Out From The World<br />Number 1<br /><br />I'll review the rest later.<br /><br />Update: The DVD video extras are beyond generous.  The music videos are reference quality anamorphic transfers that showcase the art form better than anything else I've seen.  They look perfect to me.  I did notice some pops at the end of some of these.  I'm not sure if it was my workstation or the disc, but I hope my imported & driver-matched headphones weren't damaged.  I went through multiple pairs of the same model before finding the one I liked the best and I only use this one for recreational listening.

B0000DD79B|3.0|Simon & Garfunkel are one of my all time favorite groups. They rank right up there with Zeppelin, Dylan, The Beatles, The Who, the Stones, Queen and all my other favorite musicians.<br /><br />I loved my very first S & G cd, \\"The Best Of Simon & Garfunkel\\". Since that collection had but a mere 20 songs and had a somewhat short running time of only 64 minutes, I felt I hadn't gottent the full extent of their work. I thought I'd get a far greater view with the two cd, 31 song \\"The Essential Simon & Garfunkel\\". Unfortunately, I was wrong. Why? Read on for the positives and the negatives.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />-You do get the most well known hits from the band. \\"The Sound Of Silence\\", \\"Homeward Bound\\", \\"I Am A Rock\\", \\"Scarbourough Fair/ Canticle\\", \\"Hazy Shade Of Winter\\", \\"The 59th Street Bridge (Feelin' Groovy)\\", \\"Mrs. Robinson\\", \\"The Boxer\\", \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and all the rest of the band's biggest hits are here.<br /><br />-A few underrated gems are included as well, such as \\"Keep The Customer Satisfied\\", \\"So Long Frank Lloyd Wright\\" and \\"Baby Driver\\".<br /><br />-Good sound quality.<br /><br />-Affordable enough.<br /><br />-Easy to locate.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />-As many reviewers pointed out, several of the songs are different than the original versions, most notably \\"Homeward Bound\\", \\"The Sound Of Silence\\" and \\"I Am A Rock\\".<br /><br />-Too many live versions!

0448060191|5.0|This timeless children's classic is read and enjoyed by many adults as well as children.  Unlike most classics considered children's works today, Little Women was intended for an audience of children.  It takes place during the Civil War and the years following, and narrates the story of 4 girls as they grow up, including their friends and their family.  Louisa May Alcott based this work in large part on her family, although many of the events are born totally of her imagination.  Jo is based on Louisa May; Meg is based on her older sister Anna; Beth is based on her younger sister Elizabeth, or Lizzie; and Amy is based on her youngest sister May.  Because the character Jo is based on the author herself, she is the most well defined character in the book and the one most children identify with.  A tomboy, a writer, and quite determined, Jo is the central figure in the book and most events center around her growing up, but all of the other girls get special attention in stories particularly about them from time to time. <br /> <br />There is a great sense of morality in the work, but it is never treated in a 'preachy' manner.  Values and morals are taught and absorbed by the reader as the girls learn them through various trials, some funny, some sorrowful, some frustrating.  There is likewise a very strong emphasis on God.  Much of the first half of the book centers around concepts found in the Puritan work, Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan.  The girls are often pointed by their mother toward God and placing their trust in Him and seeking His aid in various situations.  Louisa May Alcott was also a transcendentalist and her family was close friends with Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne.  Because of this, there is a sense of joy found in nature as well as respect.  In addition, Louisa May was an avid feminist in her day, although not in the sense of feminist that many think of today.  She believed that women should not be barred from admission in the workforce, or limited to work as seamstresses or governesses, nor should marriage be their only avenue of insuring a stable and secure future.  She did not get married, but did raise her sister May's daughter after May died.  Little Women is definitely not anti-marriage, but some of the characters dream of becoming well-known in their favorite fields; also, some of the characters speak about how the only way they can insure a positive, pleasant future is by marrying well, which is later rejected in a way that asserts that women should be able to choose marriage freely for love, not for position or money and likewise free to choose not to marry. <br /> <br />This book is well loved by so many.  It spurs many children on to become strong readers for life and the childhood copy of Little Women will become worn from much loved reading.  This book will be loved by most girls, but boys will enjoy it as well.  Jo's tomboyish behavior and the neighbor boy, Laurie's presence will attract the attention of boys.  It makes a great choice for bedtime reading with chapters of perfect length to read one per night and short enough that if begged by the kids, you can read two.  In addition to Little Women, it would also be beneficial to read a biography of Louisa May Alcott. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend an unabridged version.  Don't miss out on the well-known sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys.
B00003CXCW|5.0|The final line in the movie which leads to the climax for a glamorous silent film star, Norma Desmond, who seeks a way back into the motion picture business many years later. <br /> <br />Not so much drama, or suspense typical to film noir movies, this film plays on chance, accident and twists of fate to illustrate the plot which unfolds between Norma and an aspiring script writer, Joe Gillis, who is pursued by debt collectors and casually rolls his car into Ms. Desmond's garage to hide it.  What happens after this point can't be retold properly without doing the movie a disservice.  Needless to say, the complex relationship which develops between Norma and Joe has some disastrous consequences which play out in the end and make for a great film and an intense viewing experience. <br /> <br />If you've seen the Webber musical, you'll understand what goes on, but the film is rich with alot more detail which makes it that much more enjoyable. <br />

B0008ENIAC|5.0|Another great film noir, that takes a little different approach to things than others.  This time, its told from the woman's perspective.  Joan Crawford starts out as forlorn woman, whom, you're not quite sure what she's going to do. <br /> <br />The story plays out, single woman trying to make good trying to make ends meet and give her children everything she never had, with a scheming, spoilt daughter that knows exactly how to get what she wants. <br /> <br />Problem is, a body has been found, question is, who did it? <br /> <br />The details are recounted while Mildred delivers a narrative of events to the local police.  While the viewer might be able to work it out by about the half-way point, the enjoyment in the film comes with how the story plays out and exactly who does what to get to the end and what the consequences are.

B000005RS0|5.0|I purchased this item because it was said to be one of her best.  The people sure knew what they were talking about!  This album provides smooth Tina pefection all the way.  From the upbeat great grooves of \\"I Might Have Been Queen\\" and \\"Steel Claw\\"  to the sexy title track \\"Private Dancer\\" to the classics \\"Whats Love Got to Do with It?\\" and \\"Better Be Good to Me\\" this album is rocking! It's nice to have the extra tracks and extended version (even though they really aren't THAT much longer) they're a nice touch.  All in all, Tina fans will love it, people looking for some 'good time' music will appreciate it, and anyone looking for some 80's fun will have stuck gold.  This is a timeless great album.
B00062RCBW|5.0|For those who enjoyed the original series this set is the thing for you.  Here like the original series it too takes you where no man has gone before except this is more into the future than the originals.  But don't worry a few oringinal characters make a guest appearance in a couple of episodes.  My favorite guest characer appearance was Scotty in the episode \\"Relics\\" when he was talking to some crew members about some adventures on the old Enterprise as well as recreating the old bridge on the holodeck; this was like looking at my memories from the old series which I have seen dozens of times.  In TNG some new characters along with new visitors take place on a new futuristic Enterprise, more advance than old one.  My favorite visitor was Lwaxana Troi in her several episodes thoughout the series.  Some other favorites that I included \\"Cause and Effect\\", \\"A Fist Full of Datas\\", and \\"Q-Who\\".  By watching this series I it just like taking a cruise to unknown worlds on a little vacation like I did.  After all it was winter outside and there was nothing to do because of the cold and snow and was the perfect time to watch this. <br /> <br />     The things that I did not like about the series is the seasonal finales at the end of several seasons.  What has gone wrong the producers and writers?  When it aired on the FOX network it was even worst.  One episode \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" started off very good and I kept wacthing it and watching it.  The the captain was captured, they tried to rescue him but failed, and when Riker gave the order for Date to fire an energy weapon the picture goes dark followed by \\"To Be Continued\\".  I was furious and when I wanted to next part it nothing but reruns.  This was ridiculous because they should ended the season with part II or begin the new season with part I.  But anyway with this set I can see both parts togethor in one day not twelve weeks.  Another thing I did not like about the set is the outragous prices costing hundreds of dollars compared to other series.  Like before Paramont has done this to Trekies before such as forcing them spend amost ten dollars to go to a movie theater to see a TV show that is supposed to be on television.  Meanwhile other TV movies such Perry Mason and Columbo played on television right where they belong.  As for me I quit seeing Star Trek at the theatre after Star Trek VI.  So therefore is up to you to make that choice yourself.
B00007LTIA|5.0|As a kid, I was into classical music so Yes appealed to me if only because the songs were long and complex. Being the longest and most complex of their albums, I obviously liked Tales. I listen to the modern groups but, to this day, Yes is the only music I never tire of. There's something pure and smart and \\"nice\\" about it. Some people listen to music that makes them want to commit suicide. Yes makes you want to live.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004TX5F|2.0|Two stars not because of the film itself (it is magnificent), but because of the very poor picture quality of the DVD. Scenes with slow movement (see, e.g., the last one, where he rides away into the landscape) are full with artifacts, probably due to poor coding. Btw, it is not the player, which might have problems with NTSC, other NTSC DVDs play perfectly.
B00005JOE8|5.0|This could be the most dangerous movies of 2006.  How is that?  Well, for one thing it's main charachter is what you could call a terrorist.  Second, the film takes a hard look at the world as it may come to pass, a world where individuals set aside freedom in the name of security and peace.  If nothing else, V for Vendetta is the film that revolves around Benjamin Franklin's saying, \\"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\\" <br /> <br />V for Vendetta (VFV) is a creepy movie.  How so?  It shows just what could happen if Hitler and the Nazis suddenly returned, regained power and established a new dictatorship governement.  It's big brother for the twenty first century, and it's chilling.  The government is made up of cold and emotionless police and government agents who do thier job (kidnappings, beatings, etc.) with chilling efficency.  Propoganda is played on the television.  Curfews are in effect every night.  And let's not even start talking about the detainment centers... <br /> <br />Seeing this big brother government of the twenty first century is chilling.  It resembles our current state of affairs pretty well, except for all the nasty dictator stuff.  The arrest scenes (where police break into homes and carry away ordinary people) are downright chilling.  This is NOT a place you want to live.  Yet it's a fascinating look at what may happen.  The story takes place sometime in the early-mid twenty first century.  The united states has broken up into civil war over the war in the middle east which has lasted for decades.  Religious fanatics have poisioned thousands in Briton.  The movie is a fascinating study into how fear will make people do crazy things to feel safe again (such as elect power hungry maniacs who promise peace).  At one point early on, V (the title charachter) tells the public to simply look in a mirror to see who is responsible for what has happened.   <br /> <br />It isbecause of this that VFV is a warning to us, that if we give in to fear, this just might happen.  But it doesn't stop there.  Oh, no, it doesn't stop there by a long shot. <br /> <br />VFV is very deep on many levels.  When you see it the first time, you can tell that there's a lot here, yet you only get a glimpse at it.  When you see it a second time, you get a better grasp of the messages being put forth, yet there is still more to see and more to discover.  In many ways VFV is like the first matrix movie.  The deeper you go into the rabbit hole, the more you are going to find. There's even a great idea behind V's mask and his face, but i'll let you figure that one out for yourself (it's fantastic, I will say that much). <br /> <br />Arguably the best part of the entire film is V himself.  Not since Hellboy has the silver screen seen such a fascinating comic book charachter come to life.  V is intriguing, a very polite gentleman (when he's not out killing people), a fan of movies, a good cook (very amusing scene by the way), and always has that oh-so charming smile on his face (granted it's a mask, but it works so well).  His actions make him a Han solo charachter, not totally good, not totally bad.  He can be both a freedom fighter and a terrorist, depending upon how you see his actions.  Which one is he?  The movie lets you decide that for yourself, though it does lean towards freedom fighter.  With his charming personality, black cape, black hat and that awesome mask, V is an utterly fascinating charachter who is a delight to watch. <br /> <br />The movie even touches upon the subjects of religion and homosexuality in a way that can best be described as creepy.  Because religious fanatics (the film does not say what faith these fanatics were) have apparently done so much damage that religions are now completly banned.  The issue of how homosexuals are treated is truly disturbing.  In this horrible future, homosexuals are routinely arrested and have all sorts of...well, i'll let you see for yourself. It is my hope that this world does not descend to this level of barbaric cruelty. <br /> <br />While VFV may be a movie about revolution, dont go in expecting lots of action.  This is a movie about ideas (this is one of the main themes) and how ideas affect people.  That's not to say that there is no action, for there are some really well done sequences (especially a big fight near the end where V really gets to show off his fighting ability with knives).  There's also some very cool shots of huge crowds at the climax, though i'll let you see that for yourself. <br /> <br />Even with all the gloominess and dictatorship going around, VFV does have some very effective humor sprinkled in.  There's a fantastic moment where V cooks breakfast for Evey, and there's an absoloutly hilarious TV special halfway through the movie that had me laughing in the theater.  It's so funny that it would be a crime to reveal what it is, so i'll let you find out for yourself. <br /> <br />In the end, VFV is a movie about ideas.  What can happen to those who are afraid, and how ideas are things that you cannot control or kill (\\"Underneath this mask is a face and underneath that is muscles and bone.  Yet I am more then that\\").  It's a very thought provoking movie, one that is chillingly familiar to those of us living in this age of homeland security and the conflict with terrorism.  Highly recommended.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|In the adapatation of John Le Carr&eacute;'s muckraking novel The Constant Gardener, Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles  and cinematographer Cesar Charlone shot the shantytown of Nairobi (and a range of other locales) like the favelas of Rio in their much-lauded \\"City of God.\\" As Justin Quayle, Ralph Fiennes suffers some more (yes, he does it well, having had a whole lot of practice) and (less usually) is stirred to action after the murder of his beloved wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz in a part for which she won a best supporting actress even though she is the female lead and almost the only female character). Well, nominally it was an automobile accident, though she was raped and mutilated, because \\"there are no murders in Africa, only regrettable deaths.\\"<br /><br />I don't think that it is a secret that the nefarious conduct of clinical trials in Africa is the muck Le Carr&eacute;'s best-selling book raked. The movie's editing seems to be to be unnecessarily jagged, but I soon was able to sort out the chronology of the flashbacks and the transformation of the ever-so polite low-level British diplomat (Fiennes) pulled out of his garden.<br /><br />As a \\"thriller,\\" the movie takes its time getting going, but Le Carr&eacute; is not the typical \\"thriller\\" writer. And his romances generally seem more schematic than heartfelt, which is exacerbated by the casting of the cold fish (if often yearning) Ralph Fiennes.<br /><br />The DVD bonus features have considerable overlap. The best is the one that focuses on Le Carre, who pronounces himself more satisfied with the adaptation than of any of the other (many!) screen adaptations of his novels. (I'll stick with \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" for that accolade, while wishing that \\"The Little Drummer Girl\\" was both a better movie and that Le Carre's book was read more these days,  as it is even more relevant than The Constant Gardener .) Also notable is that Ralph Fiennes has a smile other than the pained one he usually delivers in movies.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|Usually I hate on albums with less that 15 tracks. After giving this album a really good listen on a long ride to grandma's house, Ms. Corinne Bailey Rae is forgiven. First of all, I love her name. Secondly, this album is beautiful. Her light voice puts you in the mind of all that soft soul from the old school. The lyricism is incredible; each track literally paints a picture for you. I turned this album on last night as I was going to bed, closed my eyes, and let her soft voice take me away. . .definitely worth the purchase.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I saw this film recently, because it started showing last week in Japan, I feel this is very unusual film as an American film not only because of gay cowboy story. This film tells about a beautiful tragedy of painful love.    I hadn't been satisfied by serious love stories by American films while I love American romantic comedies. I had been feeling there was something missing, something deep, wet, pain, hiding in words.. I am not sure. So I prefered Europian or Asian films for serious love story.    \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is going to be exception for me, that you can see emotion of the characters which is not talked by words.  I read the original story by Annie Proulx in advance, and another surprise was the film was so close to the original.     When novels turn to films there are some differences and usually the film is not good enough to show the world suggested by the original story. Of course there are some differences between them in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" but this is a rare film that neither dissapointed me nor made me feel strange.    Annie Proulx says she put the climax of the story in Motel scene where Ennis and Jack get together in four years, but Ang Lee put the climax in their last painful meeting. I think Ang Lee got the point. For me, it was the scene impress me the most during reading the story. And it was good starting at the first meeting Ennis and Jack while the original story starts with Ennis's suffering life after Jack's death.    I recomend you to read the original story that help you to feel more power of Brokeback Mountain than just seeing the movies.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I've never seen the BBC mini-series version, so I can only compare this to the book.  Naturally, large parts were cut or reduced (such as Wickham and Collins' parts).  All that information cannot be faithfully reproduced in the short time span of a movie, as it can in a miniseries.  However, the filmakers hit all the right notes in what they chose to include and how well it was rendered.  The movie focused on Lizzie and Darcy, which is of course the heart of the novel.<br /><br />The acting was top notch, especially Keira Knightly.  She deserved the Best Actress nomination as she fully embodied Lizzie.  I disagree with the reviewer below about Darcy's \\"deadpan eyes.\\"  They lit up like the sun in the closing of the movie when his love was embraced by Lizzie--he was a misunderstood person and Matthew Macfadyen conveyed that.  Additionally, it was nice that for once Darcy didn't have to be a \\"pretty boy.\\"  Rugged good looks can be just as dashing!  Donald Sutherland was a delight as Mr. Bennett, conveying his love and exasperation for a family of women with charm and dry wit.  He is a superb actor, and you could see that he truly cared about these women (and the actresses who played them).<br /><br />While the movie was spectacular, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired.  There are four main featurettes, but there is a lot of repetition between them.  The viewer need only watch \\"Behind the Scenes at the Ball.\\"  The interviews with the cast in it are repeated for \\"HBO First Look\\" and \\"A Bennet Family Portrait.\\"  The small biopic on Jane Austen was nice, but not very informative--focusing mainly on her home and where she wrote her novel.  Why not a complete biography?  And where are the deleted scenes?  Filmakers are notorious for filming more than they could ever include.  During the commentary, the filmakers mention that the dancing scene at the Ball between Darcy and Lizzie was completely recut and edited.  Why not show the original cut vis a vis the theatrical cut?  This film deserved the two-disk treatment--no doubt we'll get that in a year or two after we've all bought this version.  Hollywood sure knows how to treat the fans.This film deserved the two-disk treatment--no doubt we'll get that in a year or two after we've all bought this version.

B00005JNTX|3.0|Rating: 3.5<br /><br />This was the first movie I had seen based on a graphic novel. The film is very different; a cross between the old Batman TV series and an adult rated Anime Cartoon (Jessica Alba in tight clothing is thrown in for an added bonus!).<br /><br />I know someone who reads graphic novels and he loved this film. My stand point is from that of someone unfamiliar with the genre. It seemed that the unique visual aspect of the movie overpowered the plot/storyline. The story line(s) can get a bit blurry at times and you are then flashed with a grand visual display. It was made to truly be a \\"graphic\\" novel for the big screen. I saw them movie twice and now still have a hard time remembering all the storylines. What stands out in my mind is how visually powerful the film was.<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie that is fast-paced, fun and at times racy (my husband truly enjoyed Jessica Alba's \\"acting\\"), this film is for you. I did see V for Vendetta last week (this film was also based on a graphic novel) which visually could not compare to Sin City, but had a more of a true story line, was suspenseful, bold and even somewhat political and moral. Of the 2 movies I can say I enjoyed V more overall, but was glad I saw Sin City for its visual appeal.
0156421178|5.0|George Orwell's HOMAGE TO CATALONIA is an example of prose writing from a master.  Orwell's memoirs of his experience in the Spanish Civil War shows not only good writing but also knowledge and clear thinking.  This reviewer considers HOMAGE TO CATALONIA to be Orwell's best nonfiction work.  Readers would be well advised to read this book to get a better understanding of how political power  actually works.  Orwell volunteered to fight with the POUM units which were Marxist and Anarchist.  Orwell admits this selection was by chance, and he never regretted it.  Orwell was motivated his opposition to Fascism and idealism.  Orwell begins this book by impressions upon his arrival to Spain at the beginning of the civil war between the Spanish Republic and Franco's Phalangists or as some called them fascists.  Orwell's description of Spain during the civil war (1936-1939)undermines the false views presented by journalists too lazy or too cowardly to reveal events of this important episode in 20th century Spanish history.  Orwell's description of the Spanish  anarchists is an exemplar of descriptive writing.  Orwell is also very graphic in describing battle conditions and lack of supplies.  Yet, as serious as a writer as Orwell is, he shows a pleasant sense of humor in this book which is not detected in his other books.  The most important part of this book is Orwell's explanation of the reasons for the failure of the Spanish &#34;Left.&#34;  Lazy historians and journalists present the Spanish Civil War as a political brawl between Fascism and Democracy (the political approval word for dull minded political pundits and lazy historians).  The anarchists in the Catalonia region of Spain had an actual revolution whereby the poor actually gained a degree of self respect and independence however brief.  The future enemies of Fascism, the French and especially the British and the Soviets, undermined the Spanish anarchists.  The cowardly British leaders were afraid of losing markets while the Soviets were afraid of losing possible allies in any showdown with the Germans.  One thing that Stalin and his advisers were afraid of was the reaction in Western Europe witnessing a supposedly Communist Revolution in Russia and another one in Spain in Western Europe.  Stalin sent agents and equipment into Spain &#34;with strings attached.&#34;  The POUM anarchists and supporters were finally accused of betraying the revolution and subjected to Stalinoid purges to eliminate their political influence.  Stalin helped the capitalists and conservative Spanish in hopes of future political considerations, and this scheme worked very well.  Orwell was one of very few who first had a coherent understanding of the political climate.  Orwell has some interesting remarks for jingoist journalists who never fight but are &#34;war wimps&#34; who aid abet war without actually getting close to angry gun fire &#34;unless for the briefest of propaganda tours.&#34;  Orwell certainly was no coward as he fought in the front lines and was seriously wounded.  Orwell also expressed his profound respect for the Spaniards whether they Stalinist agents looking for him or even &#34;Fascist troops.&#34;  He commented that his experience was that the Spanish men were always gentlemen first and maybe communists or fascists second.  While Orwell was disillusioned about Big Communism from his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, he never lost his idealism and his political sympathy  for socialism as a political ideal as opposed to socialist or communist poliitcs.  Lional Trilling's introduction to this book makes this very clear.  Those who read ANIMAL FARM and 1984 can easily understand where Orwell got his inspiration for HOMAGE TO CATALONIA.  Orwell's critics who accused him of not reporting outrages committed by the Spanish &#34;leftists&#34; obviously did not read this book very carefully.  Orwell states that he was aware of such outrages, and Orwell is also clear that this bookwas based only on his experiences in the Catalonia region of Spain. Orwell bluntly stated he could not speak for other areas of Spain.  As stated in the first paragraph of this review, HOMAGE TO CATALONIA is well worth reading not only for political insight but also for masterful prose style.  Orwell gives his readers a lesson in political reality which should make the careful reader think.  This reviewer further advises the reader to read Lionel Trilling's introduction before starting the book.  Two good companion volumes to Orwell's HOMAGE TO CATALONIA are THE SPANISH LABYRINTH and the SPANISH COCKPIT.  Together these three books give the reader a first rate education of the Spanish Civil War which undermines the superficial popular history of this war.  James E. Egolf
0780020685|5.0|I mean come on, freaking explain yourself.  This is a very UNIQUE movie, not just great.  The reason i say unique is the fact that everyone loves this movie for a different reason.  They will say they like it or love it, but if you force people, they will tell you why they liked it.  Maybe you like the way something happens every scene, maybe you really liked whole forming a group of samurai element, maybe you just loved the music, maybe you loved all of the above and many other things, just like I did.<br /><br />So now i wrote a review on one of my favorite movies before and it took me like 2 hours to write and it wouldn't even be accepted because it was too long, and that was an 86 minute movie.  So I am not going to go over the story, just some moments that happened that gave it that classic movie style.<br /><br />Now the first shot of the movie definitely needs to be commented on, the horsmen come and see that the crop is not ready, but they will come back when it is.  When they leave, they speed the camera speed up a little and then show a stack of hay.  The stack of hay has a man hiding behind it, and when you see this guys face, not only will you be laughing your ass off, you will see an expression that instantly tells you that this is going to be a movie that has characters speak without words, the best type of movie talking that there is.<br /><br />Second, an hour or 2 into the movie, the lead samurai steals the show when the farmers revolt and he lays down the law.  It has to be seen to be appreciated, but this is one of the most powerful scenes in movie history.<br /><br />Last point-- I could make a list like this about a hundred moments long, but I will spare you and give you the extremely short 3(hopefully).  Another moment I really liked was when the head samurai insults the big sword guy, and the big sword(mifune) follows the samurai, I can't explain it, but it is a great part that is wonderfully enhanced by the music.<br /><br />The picture quality is very very good for black and white and considering how old it is.  Subtitles don't really leave you out of the loop too much.  And the commentary on the criterion collection version is pretty subpar, but maybe they do commentaries on japanese films differently than chinese.<br /><br />OK so a great movie and I have to give another favorite thing about this movie.  When mifune's character starts calling out that the robbers are coming and they really aren't and the farmers are screaming out samurai samurai, even though they can't even come out to meet the samurai, all of a sudden, they need their help.  I have seen scenes similiar to this, but never done with execution anywhere near this.  To top it off, the old man comes out and mifune says old man, what's wrong, the old man is speechless, but manages to spit out, nothing, everything is ok now.<br /><br />Also I left out my favorite character-the wood chopping samurai, also the master swordsman is really really cool.<br /><br />Also, the kid who has the romance and just kind of tags along with the samurai, did they deep freeze him after this was made and thaw him out in the 80's and rename him hiroyuki sanada or something?<br /><br />So I am dissapointed that I had to do a review for this cause with really really great movies I would rather just see the quality of the dvd was commented on, I love going on here and seeing different opinions on movies<br /><br /> but after seeing like 5 5-word review, I felt ashamed and wanted people to know that if you are going to review an absolutely epic movie like this one is, then put a little time into it and tell us why you like it, rather than uh yeah it's a master piece, or it's cool.  There has to be something that stands out to.>The picture quality is very very good for black and white and considering how old it is.  Subtitles don't really leave you out of the loop too much.

B000E994KE|4.0|I just love this album, it's one pf those that keeps you coming back for more. Eclipse is a truly terrifc album that will appeal to the main non savvy listeners and will have a heavy edge to satify the metal heads. The sound is not very thick as the ablum is not that heavy. I still liked Elegy better, but Amorphis defenetly lived up to the expectations with this album.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is the best collection you can get. <br />I enjoyed every song.  <br />My friends from different age all enjoyed his songs too. <br />Very classic, very relaxing.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Green day  is nothing more than a boyband with guitars. Although I like this cd it's not worthy of 5 stars. I actually like Dookie better.
B000BUYP4Q|4.0|Now this movie starts out with bruce wayne as a youngster and has some very good moments from him before he was batman.  So a not long enough scene, and one of the poorer scenes of the movie, his parents are killed and this leads to a very good scene.  So bruce wayne being very troubled in life goes on a spiritual journey and ends up in jail sorry I can't remember where, but there is a mountain and it is very icy.  There he meets liam neeson and becomes like a ninja, well a crucial moment happens and bruce has to leave, after saving liam neeson.  From this point he comes home and becomes batman. Pretty good movie from here, with an ending that was as good as any movie I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />Now I have a big and a small problem in this movie, though everyone I have talked to have disagreed with me.  I feel that they just do not watch movies close enough and must not be big fans of batman.<br /><br />#1- I think that it must have been the directors fault, so let me correct him on his mistake.  When bruce wayne is around alfred, a villain, or anybody who knows that it is him, he SHOULD use his dark voice, which christian bale didn't do a good job at, but it is still an acceptable voice.  Now when he is talking to ANYBODY else he uses his christian bale voice and they should have showcased more of this than they did.  I am a huge fan of batman the original animated series and tim burton's version which captured the voice perfectly, in fact the cartoon didn't slip up in A SINGLE episode whereas batman begins hits like double digits with how many times they screw this up.  So still a very good movie but this was a major problem for me.<br /><br />#2-everybody who bruce wayne knows, knows that he is batman, I think they should have at least thrown in a couple more just to have them around he didn't know to round it out, I mean I think there are like 1 or 2 characters who actually know batman as a mystery in this movie.  Now this was not as big of a deal to me because hey, it's a movie.f a deal to me because hey, it's a movie.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|It was an ok film. The story was decently acted, but I feel that the cast wasn't quite what it could have been. You could just tell that it wasn't up to par with the style and casting of other films about that time.
0553801503|2.0|I read and enjoyed the previous three books in this series although the first book was the best of the three. I gave up on A Feast of Crows about a third of the way through. All the likeable characters were killed off in the prior books. I think it's been three years since the last book and I don't remember that much about the surviving characters. The book should have at least had an introduction to refresh the reader as to what had happened in the prior books re-introduce the characters.
B0006399FS|5.0|It amazes me how judgemental ppl with NO talent are when it comes to judging ppl WITH talent. If any of the haters here can do better than DO it if not shut up. I love U2 and all though I don't like this particular cd as much as I have likes some of thier others I think its great that they are doing something a little differnt and throughout every career there will be some hits and some misses. If you don't like it don't listen, and if you listen keep your whinny complaints to yourself.
B000035P5E|5.0|A highly trained and well-motivated Canaris-selected operative operates in Enemy Territory. <br />This Officer carries out his mission with superb skill and without emotion...until he permits sentimentality and hormones to best his judgement. <br />Reputedly, this film is used for cautioning candidates in more than a few Nations' Externals Directorates. <br />Superb Training Film! Get it.
0525948023|4.0|The book is irresistible. I finished book in a week. It is worth reading again and agian. Eckhart I belive has universal wisdom. <br />Message is surely tough to practise but surely this is the real way to enlightment.
