B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I have been a music fan from as long as I can remember... but an opinionated one... meaning... there are as many artists I hate as artists I love.... along with many I am indifferent to.  There are genres I hate... genres I love.  All my adult life I have also been a musical hobbyist... and own all instruments I need to make music and have dabbled in quite a bit of recording gear both digital and analog.  So, I figured this documentary would be an enjoyable watch for me, despite the fact that I am not a big Dave Grohl or Foo Fighters fan.<br /><br />Well, enjoyable would be a huge understatement.  I loved it.  It was completely enjoyable to me in every segment.  I loved the old stories and history.  It also helps that I am a huge Garbage (represented here by Butch Vig) and Rick Springfield fan... so it added the aspect of at least a few artists I admire among many I am indifferent to (though appreciative of their abilities at least).  Non-musicians and casual music fans would probably find this a bit boring... but I found it fascinating.
0765325950|5.0|I have been reading the books since 1996.  Initially, I reread the entire series when each book came out to keep up with everything.  By the time book 8 rolled out, life was busier. But I still have the whole series.  I was heartbroken when I found out that Jordan had passed and thought to myself, \\"Now we will never know how it all ends.\\"  But alas, thanks be to Brandon and his gifts at writing and how he took Jordans material, combined it with his and magically ended it all.  And what an ending.  From the battles, to the way the characters do what makes them shine.  I will be rereading it all to get the story from start to finish.  Thank you Jordan and Sanderson.  What a surprise ending.  For those of you who haven't read it..I won't spoil..it's worth it.<br />  Now, if we could only get a hold of Peter Jackson and bring at least part of this epic series to life....
B001OQCV2E|3.0|It was good to see George Segal again after all these years (for me). If he can do this well in his late 70's, he should be OK for a few years more if he wants to work. Most of the starring and featured players, as a matter of fact, deserve a pat on the back for having the courage to do their best in the face of the greatest adversity (that is, the script). Actually, quite a good film rests within this mess. All it would have taken was to hire a halfway decent film doctor (they must have these counterparts to Broadway's famed play doctors), give him a quiet room and a secretary (a word processor if he prefers that), and a very blunt edged permanent marker. Preserving nearly all the visual aspects (though rearranging parts), being truly vicious with the marker on the the first hour and forty five minutes of the script, and completely rewriting the last 40 minutes, would have given them, well, almost, a first rate film. Shortening it by thirty minutes would not be a bad idea either, but there may be financial reasons for the length of the movie that are not visible to the uninformed mind. I can only say what others have said, it is unnecessarily long; no editing without altering that, can truly help. I have a particular gripe about the &#34;noble&#34; actions of the President of the United States and the leaders of other major powers, as well as the chief science advisor to the President (Chiwetel Ejiofor), but speaking of their truly fantastical speeches and action would involve revealing some features of that long last segment of the film, which is just not done. Of course, I blame not the actors but the screenwriters, for the awful hogwash that is put in their mouths. Mr. Ejiofor has my particular sympathy, since he must carry most of the  load in this regard. I have no advice for the potential viewer save that he or she pay the least possible money to see the film In that way, you will be able to enjoy the catastrophe segments and the fairly numerous OK plot lines, and bear with the rest. Of course, many reviewers &#34;loved it&#34;, gave  it five stars, and you might be one of them. Oh, yes, you, too, might enjoy seeing the few bits in which the now elderly pro, George Segal, does such a nice job (but, oh, why, oh, why, did they have to force him into that bit involving inter-ethnic marriage-a totally irrelevant prime subject for editing out.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It is awesome but I think that it should have multiplayer it would be ten stars. I would have makes it nine stars but it does not go up that high.
B004EF65QA|5.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's classic novel. A fantastic period drama with really top notch performances. This romance is along the lines of Pride and Prejudice but set among the gritty background of Northern England during the industrial revolution. Be prepared to fall in love with Richard Armitage who smolders as John Thorton the Northern mill owner. Daniela Denby-Ashe plays opposite him and gives a very nuanced performance as Marget Hale, the newly arrived parson's daughter who does not understand Mr. Thorton or the Northern way of life. A must see for period drama lovers.

B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a kid and think how great the story was ad how scary the two headed monster and trolls were. Very imaginative and the story draws you in. Val is actually very funny in this film, and the two sprites as well. This movie was done very well. So well, in fact, that George Lucas followed the story up in a 3 part novel series about Alora herself. The book series was called Chronicles of the Shadow War trilogy. Very good for those that like to read fantasy/ sci-fi from time to time. So good that I wish they'd make thses books into a sort of sequal. I know, though, that they would have to leave a lot out of them, since it is 3 books and they do go into some measure of detail. I do highly reccomend this movie, though.

B00B6SI7TG|3.0|I was so happy when I first heard \\"Heaven\\" on a local radio station's \\"new music\\" program, because a new DM album was coming out! The entire album had yet to be released, so I bought this. After I bought and listened to it, I kind of wished I hadn't spent the money. This collection of remixes is not very compelling, though most of these remixes are higher/faster bpm than the original song on the album as I subsequently discovered when Delta Machine was released and I bought it.<br /><br />So, I would say this is for DM completists only. This is not essential DM listening (some DM fans might disagree, thinking ALL DM remixes are essential listening), at least not in my opinion.<br /><br />If you are not a DM completist fan, save your money for the deluxe version of Delta Machine, instead of this. There are much more compelling songs on Delta Machine which will undoubtedly spawn far better remix collections than this one.<br /><br />The song Heaven itself is surprisingly bland in comparison with most of the other tracks on Delta Machine, some of which are much more compelling and catchy. I'm kind of surprised that it appears to be the lead single off the album, at least in the US; to my ear, there are other songs off Delta Machine that would have been better as a lead single, and definitely better remixes. *shrug*
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am a late comer to the Downton Abbey fan club, but I'm loving getting caught up on all the Downton news.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|I've been a huge DM fan since well before Violator. My younger sister had bought Speak & Spell and A Broken Frame. I got into them because of songs like \\"See You\\" and \\"Just Can't Get Enough.\\" Then I bought Some Great Reward and later my brother gave us Construction Time Again for Christmas. The two of us shared our DM collection until she went away to college in 1988 and left her albums (yes, actual vinyl) with me. I was not one of the people who fell in love with DM when Violator came out; I was already a huge DM fan by then. Thus it is from a pre-Violator DM fan's perspective that I write this review.*<br /><br />I buy every album DM release because I've learned from experience that, whatever I think on the initial listen, I'm inevitably going to like it, if not fall totally in love with it, so there's no use resisting. I'm not a total completist -- sometimes the \\"deluxe\\" versions of albums seem (cynically) more about selling as much 'product' as possible than about the music itself. (Whether that is DM, or their record company, I don't know or care; it's up to the individual fan whether or not to spend the money on the deluxe versions or maxi-singles, remixes, and eps.) When possible I give the deluxe or additional material a listen or preview and decide whether or not the music is worth the additional cost. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't.<br /><br />Delta Machine is pretty rock-solid in terms of showcasing Depeche Mode's unique sound with some modern flourishes and tips of their cap to both other styles and genres, as well as their early synthpop past. Yet it remains absolutely, identifiably Depeche Mode. You could hear any of the songs from Delta Machine in any context -- soundtrack to an extended CSI evidence-processing montage; out in a disco; sitting stoned in a coffee house in Amsterdam -- and you would *know* it is Depeche Mode, not just because of Dave Gahan's vocals but because of the sound and style of the music.<br /><br />That being said, some songs are kind of retro or maybe their sound is an homage to DM's signature style of the 80s. Some people (critics, maybe) may find that lazy but I don't see it that way, and it doesn't sound that way, either. Their sound is refined and refreshed on this due to more experimental sounds being incorporated with their usual style, and maybe because despite the heavy bass twiddling, there is almost a kind of de-emphasis on percussion, or certainly a transformation of what we usually consider to be \\"the beat\\" of the music.<br /><br />The songs on Delta Machine have their own unique hooks, but to me they mine the same sonic vein DM have always mined, a tension between dance and depression, between rock sensibilities and synthpop sounds, between upbeat rhythms and downbeat lyrics and themes. Yet they always manage to pull some fresh sounds from that vein. For the most part, this is also what DM also did on Sounds of the Universe and Playing The Angel -- both albums I really enjoyed and which I feel showcased a matured, modern DM sound while harkening back to their earliest days. There is a kind of retro-industrial synth feel to many of the songs. Yet, wonderfully and maybe miraculously, it never sounds like a tired retread of their 80s sound, because it would be so easy for them to just keep writing and playing the same songs over and over, yet I don't think that's what they or Martin Gore want or intend to do with each successive album. And they don't.<br /><br />I bought the Deluxe MP3 version of Delta Machine (after having first wasted money on the Heaven remix ep with 5 different mixes of the single Heaven; this came out before Delta Machine was officially released). If you're a casual DM fan, or even a more-than-casual but not completist DM fan, you don't need the Heaven remix ep or the deluxe version of Delta Machine. The additional songs are not musically integral to Delta Machine as a complete work; the original 13 songs stand on their own. A couple of the deluxesongs push their envelope farther, though maybe not in a repeat listening way. But then, this is how DM progresses, so if you like hearing them push their sound in different directions, not always successfully, or you are a completist, you will want the deluxe version.<br /><br />This entire album, musically, is quite solidly located in the present. It also has all the pristine, crystal clear production values I've come to associate with DM. Many songs have that certain ineffable DM sound. This tricks you into thinking you know where any given song is going. But you don't, because DM/Gore put a twist on things and go off in a different direction, sometimes quite unpredictably.<br /><br />That being said, let me go over the entire Delta Machine, song by song:<br /><br />1. Welcome To My World -- a good opener to the album. It begins with spare, industrial-knob-twirling synth sounds, and then swells into a fully fleshed out synthesizer orchestration. Dave's vocals similarly start out alone, then swell into multiple overdubbed harmonies by him and Martin. Lyrically, it's a bittersweet invitation into the band's (or Martin Gore's) beautiful and dark, wonderful and twisted, vision of the world. Grabs and holds your attention; good fodder for remixing.<br /><br />2. Angel -- picks up where the middle of the previous song left off, synthy-industrial knob twirling combined with more lyrical synth sounds. But then they mess with it, changing the rhythm signatures, which they abandon at the choruses. The lyrics are interestingly (maybe ironically) biblical in parts, and Dave's delivery alternates between storytelling and daring us to believe the epiphany described. Demands your attention; a remix would be interesting.<br /><br />3. Heaven -- begins a with slow piano chords, minor key (of course!), much slower and more downbeat than the first two songs. Has a fairly standard rock song rhythm. Existentialist lyrics, sort of. Less interesting than the previous two songs, but pretty standard DM. Surprisingly little percussion in this song, too. I have all the remixes on the pre-Delta Machine ep, but the original song is surprisingly bland, so the remixes are not all that compelling.<br /><br />4. Secret to the End -- sinuous bass lines and Dave's vocals start us off, meditating on how individual dysfunctional tendencies muddy the waters as to whose fault the problems and demise are -- or should have been. Again, surprisingly little heavy percussion in this song (ripe for remixing, imho), yet it has that DM sound, those DM lyrics (\\"the book of love/was not enough/to see us through\\"). An early guitar break, which is echoed about 3/4 of the way through the song, adds hooks. Another remix possibility.<br /><br />5. My Little Universe -- starts out like one of those semi-self-indulgent Martin Gore experiments, fairly repetitive in terms of percussion and sound, with instrumental breaks that could be remixed out takes from early DM industrial sounds. A steady, faster rhythm finally takes up the cause about 2/3-3/4 of the way through and the percussion grows. Non-DM/Gore fans may find this song somewhat annoying.<br /><br />6. Slow -- An almost bluesy hook introduces the song, Dave describing why slower is better (\\"let the world keep it's God-awful pace/I prefer to look into your beautiful face... slow, slow, as slow as you can go/I want my senses to overflow/slow, slow/and doesn't it show... I don't need a race in my bed/when speed's in my heart and speed's in my head, instead... with something so good why should we rush a thing/it's a sin/slow, slow, as slow as you can go/that's how I like it/I like it...\\"). Of course the rhythm is slow, but it's sinuous and catchy in a sensual way.<br /><br />7. Broken -- not groundbreaking but signature DM sounds, with a rising, hopeful chorus (\\"when you're falling/I will catch you/you don't have to fall that far\\"), moderately quickened beat, and more guitars than all the songs so far.<br /><br />8. The ChildInside -- my least favorite song. Slow Martin Gore-sung introspection which also seems to be a reprise  of Damaged People from the Playing The Angel album. I feel like this adds nothing to the Delta Machine album, but there is always at least one song like this on a DM album, so I accept it for what it is...<br /><br />9. Soft Touch/Raw Nerve -- almost in-your-face old-school DM synth sounds from jump. Wonderfully retro (imho; others may disagree), with lyrics to match and Dave's most straight-ahead delivery asking whether he's got the soft enough touch or is too much (\\"I'm thinking you're sinking and I'll drown/I got a confession: your depression will take me down) and then pleading for assistance (\\"Oh brother, give me a helping hand/oh, brother, tell me you understand\\"). Additional touches of sinuous synth sounds from Slow wind through here and anchor it to the Delta Machine album, despite a retro-ish sound. THIS is signature DM sound, past mixed with present.<br /><br />10. You Should Be Higher -- yes, yes, YES: All the best points of DM from past and present mixed up in a new tune, catchy and memorable. The opening swells of synthesizers reminded me of Bowie's Scary Monsters album for some reason I can't explain. Makes you want to share your earbuds with someone else and turn them on to this song; you want to sing along and dance to it. Sexy, swaggering, and slinky, anchored with a good, solid beat, it sounds more high bpm than it actually is (which means the remix will be AWESOME). The lyrics are quintessential DM (\\"I dream of a day/when I dare to believe/you're the answer/when the shame and the guilt are removed/and the truth appears/with the touch of your hand/I'll lose who I am/if I want to/I tried to resist but succumb/to the bliss of your kiss/you should be higher/I'll take you higher/don't be afraid/you'll just have to pray\\") and Dave's delivery soars to the upper register on the chorus (\\"your lies are more attractive than the truth/love is all I want/your lies are written down there in your book/love is all I want\\")<br /><br />11. Alone -- has the most obvious drum-n-bass touches, yet simultaneously very retro-industrial/throwback synth sounds and the ongoing sinuous sounds threaded through most of the songs on this album. 'Alone' is good to listen to with the bass turned up, assuming you have good speakers or a sound bar that won't distort and rattle when the bass hits its low points. Lyrics (\\"I was there when you needed me most/I was there when you needed me least/I was your father, your son, your holy ghost and priest/I couldn't save your soul/I couldn't even take you home/I couldn't fill that hole/alone\\") are typical DM, lamenting that things weren't said when they should have been.<br /><br />12. Soothe My Soul -- couples a driving rhythm with the album's signature sinuous synth sounds in a heavier, denser way that emphasizes the pop hook. Necessary percussion and clearly sexual lyrics without being overt or explicit make this song dancey-y, sexy and irresistible (\\"I'm coming for you/when the sun goes down/I'm coming for you/when there's no one around/I'll come to your house/break down the door/girl, I'm shaking/and I need more/there's only one way to soothe my soul... I'm taking my place/by your side/I'm not leaving/until I'm satisfied/there's only one way to soothe my sould... I'm coming for you/my body's hungry/I'm coming for you/like a junkie/I can't stop/'cause I'm in need/I'm not waiting/patiently/there's only one way\\" etc.)<br /><br />13. Goodbye -- another slowed down, synthy, twisty song that feels blues-inspired both musically and lyrically. It's a good closer to the album. Lyrics seem typically paradoxical DM, a damaged soul becoming whole again within the crucible of an intimate relationship and now ironically ready and able to move on from the lover who was instrumental in making it possible (\\"there is no denying/how I have been changed/you won't hear me crying/now misery is strange/I can dream/Ican fly/now it seems/I get by/with you\\")<br /><br />Now, on to the songs only on the Deluxe version of Delta Machine:<br /><br />14. Long Time Lie -- thematically fits with Delta Machine, yet feels almost like it's not entirely necessary. The inclusion of this song drags down the momentum the last few songs before it have introduced.<br /><br />15. Happens All The Time -- mixes drum-n-bass touches with the synth sound of the album and then ups the ante with additional flourishes and swelling/shrinking vibrating synth chords and themes. Unlike Long Time Lie, this feels less superfluous and more like it belongs with the rest of Delta Machine, a kind of appropriate post-script to the closing song Goodbye.<br /><br />16. Always -- more experimental sounding than anything else on the album except maybe The Child Inside, yet somehow less self-indulgent noodling than The Child Inside. A weirdly sweet chorus combined with a steady heartbeat of rhythm breaks up the weirdness and turns it into a song, though not something you would exactly sing along with. Martin Gore sings this one, and while it doesn't exactly fit with the rest of Delta Machine, I would have included this before Long Time Lie, because by the time Long Time Lie comes along on the deluxe version of Delta Machine, it's almost superfluous -- whereas Always is not, because there is really nothing else like it on the album. Succeeds in ways that My Little Universe does not, somehow (imho).<br /><br />17. All That's Mine -- another song that feels non-essential. It sort of fits with the rest of the songs, but there's nothing all that special about it (not like Always or Happens All The Time). If All That's Mine were included earlier on the album, instead of as an afterthought on the deluxe version, other songs might seem more unnecessary, such as My Little Universe or The Child Inside (the latter seems superfluous, anyway, with its melody that seems straight out of Damaged People).<br /><br />All in all, I can see why the Daily Mail criticized this album for being kind of relentlessly dark. It seems that way on the first listen or two or three. In my case, however, I have listened to it more or less over and over -- and also in between listens to earlier DM albums -- since it came out and I like it more and more with each listen. This is a GREAT headphones or earbuds album, as with pretty much anything DM does. I look forward to remixes of some of the songs on Delta Machine.<br /><br />*I saw DM live in Chicago at the Aragon Ballroom (capacity: about 2,000) after Construction Time Again came out; I saw them again a few years later on their Black Celebration tour. Talk about different concerts! Vince Clark was no longer with them when they played at the Aragon (but I had fallen in love with the sounds of Yaz, too, by then). DM's concert at the Aragon was ass-kicking, high bpm dance music, positively infectious. Their Black Celebration concert, at an outdoor suburban Chicago venue which no longer exists (Poplar Creek), was a depressive's dream come true: dark, doomy, gloomy and overpoweringly dirge-like.<br /><br />I was under-age, out dancing to DM's music and mixes at \\"juice bars,\\" that late-80s dance club solution to the all-ages fanbase dilemma. I absolutely LOVED Violator, but it was not my introduction to DM. I knew their sound had changed significantly between the first two albums and Some Great Reward and Black Celebration, let alone between SGW and MftM. Unlike many early DM fans, I did not regard Violator as their \\"sell out\\" album. I *did* consider it a perfect synthesis of Martin Gore's pop song writing with their original synthpop/industrial sound, fleshed out with lots more synthesizers -- yet somehow boiling their music down to the essence of catchy tunes and hooks that they had always had but which most people had never noticed.<br /><br />Over the years, there have been DM albums I've liked more and less than those first few. Strangely, unlike most fans, I loved Songs of Faith and Devotion, which the Violator influx of fans largely considered a poor follow-up to Violater. (But then, how do you follow something like Violator? It's almost impossible.) SOFAD seemed like a progression of their sound to me, a further refinement of their musical aesthetic, and as dark or darker than Violator (but not as dark as Black Celebration), with nearly as many catchy hooks. Mass audiences didn't see it that way, and DM never recaptured the international charts on any subsequent albums the way they dominated the charts all over the world with Violator.<br /><br />It must also be kept in mind that DM is very much a remix band, and always was, almost from the start. That's not a good or bad thing; it's just a fact. Often their music, while not big on the charts, is being played in discos and clubs in totally different remixed forms. For me, DM was one of those bands where quite often you HAD to buy the singles (CD singles) to get the \\"good stuff\\" -- the awesome remixes of the album or studio versions of songs. (Examples range from the Route 66/Behind The Wheel remix to the near-instrumental remix of In Your Room by Portishead and the sped-up extended remix of I Feel Loved.) Some DM fans may consider that heresy, but I think it's a complement.<br /><br />From the start, one of the things I loved about them was their pairing of danceable tunes (or remixes) with dark lyrics and themes. On the same album they often had danceable (Master and Servant) and doomy gloomy tunes (Blasphemous Rumours), and that was one of the things I loved about them; it kind of captured my adolescent mood swings from joy-of-being-alive dancing to throw-yourself-on-your-bed-because-the-world-sucks depression. This latter aspect of their music -- the dichotomy between infectious pop songs and more interior, moody, dark music -- has not changed over the decades; they seem to always encompass both kinds of music on every album, and Delta Machine is no exception.<br /><br />DM's sound has also progressed as synthesizer and studio technology has improved. They've also branched out to incorporate other musical movements, such as aspects of drum-and-bass on their last few albums. Yet they do so without copying anyone and, to my ear, without changing their sound for faddish reasons. Their inclusion of drum-and-bass and triphop styles in some songs from previous albums seems more like a smooth and serendipitous coming-together of styles that complement each other quite well, than a calculated effort to pull in new fans.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|Brief synopsis - Camille Preaker is a cub crime reporter with a low-end newspaper in Chicago. When a couple of girls from her hometown in Missouri are found murdered with striking similarities, her boss sends her to report the story, hoping to break a story that will bring the newspaper into the spotlight.  Camille unwillingly goes back to her hometown, staying with her mother, stepfather, and teen half-sister that she barely remembers, and begins the painful process of inserting herself back into her small hometown and its rumors and gossip.  Slowly, you realize there is something wrong with this entire picture.  It seems virtually every person in this town has petty grievances, old grudges, and a sick enjoyment in harming one another while pretending Southern grace and hospitality.  It is obvious that every person in this town has serious issues - none more than Camille and her family - that everyone politely dismisses in that closed off, small town way that those type of places have a tendency \\"to protect their own.\\"  Not since My Sweet Audrina by VC Andrews have I read about a family or a community that is so determined to protect their dark, evil secrets with lies shielded by smiles.<br /><br />As I read, the dread factor kept building, as you are slowly immersed into this town and realize how genuinely screwed up it is.  I read this book quickly, eager to uncover the next dark secret and unravel the dark tapestry of the town.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for a few reasons.  First, small towns are often dens of cliques, rumors, and secrets, but to find not one single person in this story not damaged and slightly deranged was a bit unbelievable.  Every single person was fake and plastic - a town full of Stepford Wives.  Second, I often got irritated at Camille, willing her to quit being so weak and stand up for herself.  I found it hard to believe someone THAT damaged and spineless could have been capable of taking care of herself, much less be a reporter.  Ialso found it hard to believe a crime reporter would be so clueless in some of the more obvious situations where 2 + 2 can only equal 4.  Finally, without giving too much away, I figured out the two biggest \\"mysteries\\" midway through the book - who the killer was and the big secret regarding Camille, her sister Marian, and her mother.  It was way too easy to figure out.  With that said, that didn't keep me from racing to the end and there were some very clever twists at the end that added to the loose ends I had tied 100 pages earlier.<br /><br />Would I recommend it?  Yes, it was definitely entertaining and cleverly written. I just hope her other books, which I plan to read, don't make the ending so obvious.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I loveddddddddddd it!!!!

B005GFPZYK|4.0|As the father of an Air Force Combat Control son I really enjoy reading of the brave soldiers the USA deploys to the war zone.  Without a doubt our soldiers are the best trained and have the most discipline of any fighting man or woman in combat.  I am in awe of you all and may God speed.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Not a movie one would put high on the &#34;wow,let's watch that again list&#34;. See it once then it is another thing off your bucket list,lol!
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I enjoy the challenge of FreeCell as opposed to always playing Solitaire.  Great for keeping away boredom when I am not reading.
B00005MHNH|5.0|A truly magnificent English/French period film, I watch it often on a Sunday afternoon (it's a long one) a very rich production takes you right into the movie as if you were there.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I do like the information given, but I find the format is harder to read than the regular AccuWeather. Maybe I am just not used to how the information is presented.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I did not watch this show from conception, but I can tell you, that I absolutely love this show. It reminds me of the chemistry between Jane and Libson on The Mentalist. Castle and Beckett are a HOOT.

B0044C5SCU|4.0|A little different and at times confusing as to which side they were showing.  But was still worth watching.  Some episodes story line reminded me of another show with a similar story line.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is really fun. Great alternative to temple run. I enjoyed this game thoroughly, although the missions were little too easy.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|LOVEEE it :) A must read! Read it in less than 24 hours. I didn't want the book to end!
B008JIWNYG|4.0|It's pretty good but could be much better it's obviously just meant for setting up a future story- the one that is happening in comics right now, as seen by sinestros flash forward.(is that what it's called?)
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was amazing for kids 6-12, I loved it and so did my cousins.  The narration was amazing also, it wasn't bad fluency at all and it did the character's voices also.  This book is free, GET IT!!!:)  this book was awesome.
B000002JEV|4.0|The singer is good most of the time.  The musicians are outstanding.  I could do without the long drum solo in dazed and confused.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|Very hard to control the ball on my Galaxy Nexus. I thought it might be due to the fact that I was on a commercial fishing boat while playing it. But I had the same problems while on land.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Enough of a legal aspect to keep me entertained  with deceive work along with brain functions logical thinking that I found good to view
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell is sad and funny and can write a hell of a song. Blue is one of her best albums.
B00BPA6XUK|4.0|A mature, modern -- but not in any way groundbreaking -- score.<br /><br />Strictly speaking, not really an \\"original\\" OST ;)  ... but when composers -- for whatever reason -- TASTEFULLY repeat (= copy)  their previous work (Joseph Trapanese from Tron Legacy) and/or sample (tho' some would prefer call it \\"homage\\") works of other composers (in this case, Nolan's Batman scores, by Zimmer/Newton-Howard) ... what can one say except ... \\"works for me\\"! I really liked the Nolan/Batman scores and thought Tron Legacy (also w/Joseph Trapanese) was decent... so I'm not complaining; rather, I'm simply stating I'm getting more of a good, cinemusical fix with this score.<br /><br />[Example of acceptable homage, IMO] The 20th Cent. conductor Leopold Stowkoski  was noted for transcribing works from major composers such as Bach ... and effectively reinterpreting them in new + fresh ways ... adding, say, melody and romance to stylistically mechanical Baroque works.<br />[Example of acceptable re-sampling, IMO] Zimmer's Batman scores continued to please tho' most of the creative effort was in the first trilogy film, Batman Begins.<br />So ... in the tradition or style of Stowkoski and Zimmer, that's what M83 has done here with Oblivion....very good during its best moments (Waking Up; Supercell) but -- and perhaps more importantly -- never offensive or uninteresting to the ear at any time.<br /><br />Fave tracks:<br />Waking up<br />Supercell<br /><br />Notes:<br />I haven't yet seen this film and may never get around to experiencing this OST in its \\"original\\" context. I'm not really a film fan per se -- and more often than not, disappointed with the format. Rather, I find certain well-done ST's much more satisfying as standalone art (e.g., CD album), even for STs coupled to \\"high-rated\\" efforts such as Nolan's Batman or Zero Dark Thirty.<br />[This review is a work in progress -- More to be added later]
B00A11AN6O|1.0|They change the deal after youre already invested. A year from now theyll change the deal and theyll hold your data hostage. Just like they did with their &quot;free&quot; music storage. Dont trust them.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Excelente continuidad de la historia. Como los libros anteriores, la narración divida en capítulos por personajes lo hace muy dinámico y entretenido al momento de las interacciones entre ellos.
B002MJV7JA|5.0|Great dvd!!! I just began watching the Kardashians and I love this show!!!! In amazing condition!!! Thank you so so much!!!
B0035WTE2U|5.0|I enjoyed the sound track and the movie. it was a good movie to see and a good sound track to get.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I didn't know before I bought this that it would have some &#34;Space&#34; levels (although I probably should have).  I don't like &#34;Angry Birds: Space&#34;, so those levels really frustrated me, but all the Star Wars details are great.  I bought it when it was $.99, so it was well worth it for me.  I think most &#34;Star Wars&#34; fans that like &#34;Angry Birds&#34; will think it's a hoot.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|I got this one for my father and he love it. I enjoy see it too. Any one who is a Daniel Craig fan will like this one.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|great had a lot of parts that the two show did not have due to timing. doctor who is the best

B0012GMV58|5.0|i enjoyed this album Because his 70's stuff was good to listen to and he never changed much over the years.
0316077046|4.0|Lena just hasn't been the same since her uncle Macon died.  She keeps retreating farther and farther away from everything--school, her remaining family, and Ethan.  Ethan would wait forever if he knew that's what Lena needed or wanted but the waiting is starting to turn into a distance between them that he feels desperate to close.  The harder Ethan pushes her to come back to him, the further it pushes Lena away.  When she stops kelting with him (a secret communication where they can talk in each other's minds), Ethan knows he's in danger of losing her love.<br /><br />But, Ethan Waite is not a quitter.  When Lena disappears into the netherworld with a paranormal, motorcycle-driving hottie, Ethan figures out a way to follow and save her.  But, does she want to be saved?<br /><br />Ethan looks to his aunt and favorite librarian, Marilyn, for help but she passes him to her new assistant, a beauty from England who almost makes Ethan forget about Lena.  Pretty soon, he doesn't know why he's chasing Lean--is it to find her or just she he can spend more time with the new librarian who seems to be falling for Ethan just as hard.<br /><br />Link is just the same, a comedic sidekick who is still running after crazy siren Ridley.  All the other main characters are back, too, and just as much fun; the town is just as Southern and just as charming.<br /><br />This one is much darker and more despairing than the first but I still loved it.  It keeps drawing me right along to the next installment.  One thing that did really start to grate on my nerves about halfway through was Ethan's constant whining.  His sensitivity is going to need to take a back seat if he's going to get his girl back!
B009DH372Y|5.0|I enjoyed this one because it was during the magic tour and that album was a good to get as well.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|this was a downloaded song so I do not know why I would have to do a review for it

B000024C7W|5.0|I enjoy his music. I never seen the movie for the sound track but the sound track was a good one to get.
B00377E5SG|5.0|I normally don't enjoy remakes... this is (was) the exception.  Great actors and a superb update to the original script.  I recommend watching BOTH the original movie and this remake...both are great movies.
B008V59AFW|5.0|I liked him in Genesis and his solo stuff too. I liked his  lamp album and sell England by the pound. this one of his is a good one to get.

B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|kids enjoyed it. bought movie.  showed it to students as well.  entertaining for them, but once was enough for me.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|A historical fiction of World War II and the beginnings of the Cold War. A good synopsis of the key events of the period. Somewhat contrived in order to get the characters in the right places at the right times, but an enjoyable read.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|my grandson loves air hockey. We play each other then he can play by himself. I think it one of his best loved game. He is 6 years old.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Gary Clark is very talented, refreshing in his style. He plays new material as well as interprets and honors &#34;classic&#34; numbers. What a variety of styles all on one disc. I'm enjoying it over and over and over...
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love it that my grandson has to always has to keep his eyes and brain in this game. He will be using this one for a long time. He gets to laughing when I find one that works when he can't. Everyone from 4-60 can enjoy this one.
1932100660|5.0|This book should go to the top of required reading for so many-educators, chefs, physicians, dieticians, nurses, parents, and the list goes on and on. Excellent, research based findings that can lead the reader to a happy, healthy, long life. This book's information is your best health insurance policy at the lowest cost ever. If read and applied we could put most insurance companies right out of business...
B007V4530A|5.0|Excellent advice for organization and presentation of a 20 minute talk. Follow the advice and turn a good presentation into a real attention-getter.
1416549447|5.0|What an excellent book! Danny has hit on knowledge for any runner and non-runner on the face of the Earth. After reading and re-reading and passing on my original copy to running friends I had to purchase another copy to keep (and loan out). My love of running has been renewed and expanded after reading practicing his running form. Thanks!
B005ERIRZE|5.0|Enlightening book with concepts new to me. Very useful.  I will use it as a reference tool. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|Had seen it in the past although I didn't remember it too much. Plenty of good laughs, fun to see two main accomplished actors early in their careers displaying their talents even then.
B0065AVS0K|5.0|This is both a visual treat and a fun movie. Shot and edited in digital without any use of film,<br /><br />Exciting and fun and at times  violent ... I loved it!
B00821OX98|5.0|This series keep you thrilled and wanting more. I would recommend to other.  I can't wait until season 3.  I check at TNT and season 3 is scheduled for June 9, 2013.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it's. just like playing the real game. fun and additive. I would highly recommend this to anyone of any age.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I was worried when I first purchased this item because most of the pictures show a Mac and I have a 15'' Asus PC. Macs tend to be more flat on the bottom and PCs tend to have a more irregular bottom. Once I received the riser my laptop fit perfectly and the rubber pads hold it in place with no movement what so ever. I'm very happy which this purchase. It's styled very nicely and works great. I would recomend this product to a friend.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|You usually have to pay for applications as good as this one. The first time I used it to identify a song, it was spot on. Very handy! I can see myself using it again in the future.
B00A6CT012|5.0|I have been following the blog for about two years, and always enjoying the insights and advice. I bought the book thinking that it would just consolidate a lot of pre-existing blog posts. I was very wrong. The book is a much more in-depth and thorough look at how to make zero waste a feasible lifestyle.<br /><br />The book is well organized into sections dealing with different areas of the home and life, so there is no need to read it in order. You can just skip ahead to the sections most relevant to you. The author's enthusiasm is evident throughout, and her research is incredibly thorough. She includes a plethora of resources to ease the transition to less and zero waste for anyone willing to try.<br /><br />There are many books about environmentalism, sustainability, and adopting a greener lifestyle. What I love about this one, is that it makes unnecessary looking at statistics and studying the impact of excessive waste in more detail. It's understood that we know the impact is masses. Rather than overwhelm us with this information, the author chooses to focus on practical, actionable advice and strategies for incorporating meaningful changes into our personal lives. Her advice on reaching out to companies and government officials is also thoughtful, simple, and easy-to-follow. It's almost miraculous that a book about a lifestyle change that seems so extreme manages to sound so feasible and not intimidating.<br /><br />There's a lot of great advice here, and I have a feeling I will be rereading and revisiting parts of this book for a long time to come.
B001FB55H6|4.0|The transfer looks pretty decent. I really liked the original movie even though it is well over 2 1/2 hours. The extended Director's Cut is right at 3 hours. Some of the extra scenes didn't feel quite right to me. Many of them are about Rorschach. I won't spoil how they focus on him, but I can see why they were cut. It's kind of nice to see a little more about him, but ultimately they detracted from the film, making it overly long. Other extra scenes focus on Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan. They are a little better, but as with the other scenes, they aren't really needed. If you are a fan of the movie, you won't mind the extra stuff as much. For someone who's not seen it, they might not like having to sit through 3 hours.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I gave the book about 100 pages.<br />It dragged on and on, about life in a silo. Something like an old missel silo that was more than 100 stories deep.<br />Maybe this was just the intro, but I was very tedious.<br />I mean, the author spent a few pages going on and on about knitting....<br /><br />I bought this book because of the great reviews.<br />There was one other book I purchased because of the high number of high<br />ratings, the Forever War. It was terrible too.<br /><br />FYI: Normally, I do not write any reviews. Then I thought about other customers out there,<br />So, I am writing this as a service. I'm sure I'm going to get flamed, but above are my opinions.<br />And as they say about opinions, they are like belly buttons, every body has one.
B001O6W9QC|1.0|Your time is SO much more valuable than wasting it on this...and here are the eight more words to finish review.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|I find this show very interesting, it is not just about Viking violence, there is a good story line behind this show. Parts of the show are rather predictable, but this show is definitely worth watching.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I fund it to be moving store of an eleven year old girl who had her childhood stolen by two sick bastards<br />Who should rot in hell for eternity.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My husband and I don't always have the same tastes in movies but he couldn't wait to see each episode of this.  I rarely get tearful about anything I see on TV anymore.  However,  this series is so well done that I actually cried about the happy and the sad things as if I really knew the people!
B0097RU0SE|4.0|As of this writing there are 2 versions of this Blu-ray available on Amazon, an import that has been available since Dec. 2012 and the US version that became available in April 2013. I waited until the US version became available to buy this because in the product description it said the US Blu-ray was a 2 disc set. I scoured the internet to find out more but couldn't find any info regarding this. This seemed a bit strange to me but I thought hey, maybe the US is getting some exclusive content so I waited. I just got mine and sure enough it's a single disc.<br /><br />I called Amazon customer service and all they could do was offer a replacement and take note of my complaint. I mentioned that the Blu-Ray cover insert was reversible, on the outside the UPC was different then the one on the inside. I also noticed that the inside of the cover insert had the green label with the German text and a #12 on it but not the outside. What I think is going on here is that they just flip the insert over depending on what country they are selling it to. I'm convinced that there is no difference between the import or US version. I told the customer service person this but we thought we would try another one anyway. Guess what?, same thing. So as long as they're selling both versions buy the import, it's cheaper. According to the manufacturer the disc is region free and a comment made to a review of the import version on Amazon says it plays fine on a US Blu-ray player. I'm taking 1 star off just because of the issues I had with this and not because of the content, which is excellent.<br /><br />I own everything Saxon has ever put out and if I were to recommend a single video to a new fan this would be it. It is the most comprehensive of them all. Probably not the best for concert footage but certainly the best for learning about the band. They are totally underrated and under appreciated here in the states. For concert footage I'm really fond of \\"Saxon Chronicles\\". Another one that's a great bargain is \\"Heavy Metal Thunder - Live - Eagles Over Wacken\\" which gives you 2 CD's and a DVD. Long Live Saxon!
1603420398|5.0|I bought this book in conjunction with &#34;Connect the Shapes Crochet Motifs,&#34; and I have rarely been happier with two texts.  The ideas and instructions in this text are clear, concise, and utterly creative.  I have made a baby blanket with the methods laid out by Edie Eckman, and it has been one of my favorite fiber pieces to date.  I would highly recommend this book to any fiber artist I know.
B00AWBNNAG|5.0|I have a grandson who loves lego's. It helps when assembling his kits and he has a lot of them.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Awesome Book! I really liked it, but it took me a while to finish it because it has a pretty slow start.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great app, just a pain in the neck to try to accumulate gems.  should be able to purchase gems with coins.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I didn't like book 3 ending.  Why repeat the beginning of book #1 by writing what Christine thought's were?  I still wish there was a 4th book and can not wait for the movie.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I've heard people say it's something most would have thought would be \\"impossible to adapt into a movie.\\" It's not nearly intelligent enough to be difficult to adapt into a movie. It's trying to be, but it fails on every level. The only element of the story with so much as the POTENTIAL to be interesting is the bit about Pi faithfully devoting himself to three different religions... an aspect of his character that is never revisited after the first quarter of the book. The kid-in-a-boat-with-a-tiger bit is nothing but an abridged version of Poe's \\"Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym\\" with a tiger for no reason and an inexplicable... carnivorous meerkat island-creature... thing.<br /><br />Honestly it seems like the author read Arthur Gordon Pym while watching The Lion King and decided to write his own Guy In A Boat story, doing the rest of his research by watching \\"Big Cat Diary\\" and visiting a zoo once or twice. Also he happened to have a cookbook of Indian food in the house, apparently.<br /><br />I remember seeing this book many times in the bookstore and finding the cover intriguing but always inevitably deciding it wasn't worth reading. I finally read it as a challenge after being told by several friends how disappointing it was, and by another that it was really good. Challenge accepted -- I had to decide for myself.<br /><br />I have decided that it is a weak, disjointed disaster of an untidy narrative that flirts with some ideas and situations that COULD have been interesting if they had been explored in any particular depth, but there are too many themes and too many situations that fail to become a single cohesive story in the end, and are frankly annoying in how overly simplified they are.<br /><br />This book reads like cliff notes of better books all tossed into a grade schooler's attempt to make Calvin and Hobbes into an epic adventure story... an attempt that succeeds only in missing its own point every time.
B00846REIS|5.0|The book is similar to Fifty Shades of Grey but I liked it so much that I pre-ordered the last book.
B009YQJ322|4.0|The plot is simple enough: Judges are the only rule of law in a post-apocalyptic futuristic setting where crime, drugs and violence run rampant and the law is pretty much nonexistent. In Mega City One there is Judge Dredd, one of its most loyal, unforgiving and harshest Judges. Stuck with a rookie Judge, he gets embroiled in a drug war in one of the City's major housing developments, Peach Trees. Run by Ma-Ma, a former hooker turned drug war lady, is plummeting the city further into chaos and violence with the proliferation of her drug, Slo-Mo.<br /><br />When I watched this revamp (and yes, I did like the original with Stallone), I was still recollecting the  original film, [[ASIN:B004IDG97S Judge Dredd]] (1995), in all its cheesy, deadpan glory. Both versions are based off the British comic of the same name ([[ASIN:1613775504 Judge Dredd: The Complete Carlos Ezquerra Vol. 1]]) but with completely different story lines.<br /><br />What the modern version has in similarity to the original is its protagonist: Dredd, who has a plethora of cliched one-liners and a constant frown throughout. It's supposed to be cheesy and Karl Urban (Bourne Supremacy, Star Trek) does exactly as he should have and is an homage to the original. Understand it, accept it and move on or you will hate it beginning to end. Not once do we see Dredd's face. He is just a face of the Law. Anderson (Olivia Thirbly, Juno, The Darkest Hour) is our emotional rope through the dreary morass. She is naive but stubborn, hopeful and scared. It's not in-depth; however, it was a nice cut through all the brutality. Lenda Headey (Game of Thrones, 300, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles) as Ma-Ma was a nice turn though one-dimensional but anything less or more would have set the tone of the movie off. She is the perfect evil, heartless and utterly ruthless villainess, the complete opposite of our hero, Dredd.<br /><br />Dredd, as a whole, is slower paced but steady and didn't drag. It's violent and it's got action but there is little dialogue and characterization above the basic, yet somehow, I enjoyed it. That's probably because of the creative, darker, edgy, tense directing and the graphic visuals. It is self contained within one setting and that's usually dull but it wasn't. Pete Travis (Vantage Point) does something that is DIFFERENT. It's hard to pinpoint what that is but it works. From the production, the look, the visuals, the special FX and its minimalistic approach to everything else. The setting from Cursed Earth to Mega City One to Peach Trees has a melange of ideas--Mad Max slash Waterworld, late 90s Ghetto bleakness, comic cool, gritty edge of dystopian dreary video game vibe--that melds perfectly in unison.<br /><br />Again, there is nothing new in the terms of the plot and I doubt the sequel that is most definitely to come will offer us more. It's what the director does, showing us his plot through sustained action and unrelentless, saturated violence. It obliterates the actors themselves who are mere caricatures but that's okay. We get enough background of Mega City One, of Dredd and his rookie, Judge Anderson. Those elements are uncomplicated, simple and basic, and necessary in order to get to the heart of it all, action and the visual overload. In the end, it's all sensory information. Some will hate it. I didn't. Some won't get it, and that's okay.t action but there is little dialogue and characterization above the basic, yet somehow, I enjoyed it. That's probably because of the creative, darker, edgy, tense directing and the graphic visuals. It is self contained within one setting and that's usually dull but it wasn't. Pete Travis (Vantage Point) does something that is DIFFERENT. It's hard to pinpoint what that is but it works. From the production, the look, the visuals, the special FX and its minimalistic approach to everything else. The setting from Cursed Earth to Mega City One to Peach Trees has a melange of ideas--Mad Max slash Waterworld, late 90s Ghetto bleakness, comic cool, gritty edge of dystopian dreary video game vibe--that melds perfectly in unison.<br /><br />Again, there is nothing new in the terms of the plot and I doubt the sequel that is most definitely to come will offer us more. It's what the director does, showing us his plot through sustained action and unrelentless, saturated violence. It obliterates the actors themselves who are mere caricatures but that's okay. We get enough background of Mega City One, of Dredd and his rookie, Judge Anderson. Those elements are uncomplicated, simple and basic, and necessary in order to get to the heart of it all, action and the visual overload. In the end, it's all sensory information. Some will hate it. I didn't. Some won't get it, and that's okay.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Once I read the first book I had to order the next.  It's a page turner and can't wait until the next one arrives in early June.
B00068TJM6|5.0|This thing feels like it's worth way more than the $250 or so MSRP. Solid end-links, screw-down crown and buttons, and a big Hardlex crystal give it a feel of heft and durability. The look is classic, and the photos don't capture the &#34;3D&#34; look the face has; the dials and hands have real depth that grabs your attention. Mine seems to run about +/- 1 second per day.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|Areally great class movie, very good, very fun, loved the actors, I used this movie for a class project. Iown the movie, but I forgot so I did not buy it again. I recommend this movie to everybody it's a great western.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A well spun yarn full of twists, intrigue and danger.  The main character is smart, charming, sexy, and, very handsome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a really great app. Especially for tweens and teens. Me and all my friends enjoy playing it. it is awesome
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This was a really good book that kept me interested from start to finish, the subject matter was sad but then life can be that way some times
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|When we are watching a TED Talk, we tend to think: this is not for me... as a speaker. We emphasize the personal performance of the speaker as if it were in his genes. This book is a proof that we are wrong. Being able to deliver a TED speech isn't related to individual talent. Of course talent helps, but lacking speaking skills don't prevent you from joining this TED talks crowd. Because this book gives you the recipe to improve graduallly your abilities, till you're able to deliver.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Fun game, but Kids used to have it on DS so may have made it too easy, they were done in 2days.
B008SVS0K0|5.0|I love these guys. Saw them perform live in Detroit. If you're into punk rock, you'll appreciate this one since BT got away from their alternative vibe and took a more political tone that is true to the genre!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Awesome. Its simplicity; visual; audio effects are addicting. Reaching the end? Start over and you see a whole new game.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I just finished reading this book, and was pleasantly surprised.  This is a very solid story that had me laughing and crying out along with the well-formed characters.  This story will especially grab your heart because it is based on fact.  The Roman Catholic church continued to operate these slave-labor 'orphanages' as recently as 1996 in Ireland!  I have Irish ancestors, and it shames me that something so horrible could have gone on for so long in that country.  I will be looking forward to more grand stories from Christina McKenna.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fantastic story, I couldn't put it down! Hugh has created a world at once so different and yet eerily similar that one can see a future such as this coming to pass if things go seriously wrong...
B0074VTHKM|2.0|Sorry to say this, but even kids get bored.  I would appreciate it if you take this author out of the list of offers for me.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I can't keep my husband off my kindle now.  This is another addictive game but lots of fun. recommend highly
B004LROUNG|3.0|I'm afraid that I won't give Grisham another chance.  Since &#34;The Firm&#34; he has steadily gone down in my estimation because his books are no longer engaging (my personal opinion).
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game can really take up your time.  You won't be able to put it down and it is really kind of hard.
0345803485|3.0|To everyone hating or pointing out the flaws about realism or the lack there of, let me remind you that this book is intended for women first and foremost. Another thing, this IS erotica, fantasy basically, so the lack of realism is not something the author cared about obviously. This book is like porn for women.
B0010VHXOE|5.0|I have since buying the gotten all of his other stuff...I like his turn of pharse and I like the music...creative without being over done and catchy tunes that stay in your head.
B009P3N1GI|5.0|I have read all of Brandon Sanderson's books and he still continues to amaze me with the way he can create an entire world complete with its own rules and magics every time.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie had my attention from beginning to end, and I enjoyed every bit of it. And that is all you really need to know, so just see it already.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|I can legitimately say with every fiber of my being this is my favorite album by anyone ever.  I can not even tell you the times I've listened to this beginning to end over and over.  I bought this originally in 2009 I think and have listened to it pretty consistently since then.  It is my go-to work out music, as the songs build over time and are pretty long, so by the time you listen to one you've already run more than a mile and are pumped for the next one!<br /><br />My favorite songs on the album:<br /><br />Touch it/technologic<br />too long/steam machine<br />face to face/short circuit<br />one more time/aerodynamic<br />prime time of your life/brainwasher/rollin and scratchin<br />da funk/daftendirekt<br /><br />This album is meant to be listened to beginning to end.  The songs lead into each other... it's just perfect.  If you don't like this album, chances are I don't like you.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time, while reading it I often wondered just how close to the truth it was? I am sure that I will read it again, this in my opinion was a 5*+read
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Could not put it down. Normally dont read this type of book but thought Id give it a shot for 99 cents. Finished in 24 hours.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I don't like to resuffle cards when no moves game ok<br />not sure how well yet can be beaten butttt
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|samuri vs zombies 2 is a lot better than the first one, I like the added online and challenge of the day.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Author of Gone Girl and Dark Places, Sharp Objects is another deeply disturbing novel by Gillian Flynn. Our protaganist, a newspaper reporter sent back to her home town in Missouri to cover a series of child abductions/murders finds herself struggling to remain sane and focused when confronted with the ghosts of her childhood. An engaging and creepy whodunnit, it will keep you up at night long after you've put it down.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It is very enjoyable and it creeps some people out with its accuracy!~ I just love it! It is really fun!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Please give me a refund on this movie. About 6 minutes into the movie it freezes up and we get a horn like noise until we completely shut down everything.
B001TW68P4|5.0|Simply awesome to find old music on cd's. Many more purchases to get in the future. Really happy to hear all the songs from the past. Everyone should shop Amazon and find their lost treasures. Thanks
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|If you like long involved sentences using old antiquated words with many characters, you will like this classic that deals with relationships in the Vistorian Age.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 was very interesting.  There were many plots and it kept you wondering what will happen next.  I can't wait to see season 3.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I can't get enough of this game. It is very addicting and when I got stuck on one level, I could not put it down unroll I succedded.
B00701QVVY|5.0|ive been a fan of overkill since taking over which in itself set the standard for thrash in the late eighties. I dug years of decay somewhat after that. After i bought coverkill i turned my back. All i can say is this album is an allout thrash masterpiece. The songwriting is crisp old school with actual stanzas and choruses which to me has always been overkills strong point. Vocal delivery is machine gun sharp by hellsworth and this drummer may be better than lombardo or bostaph. Ive heard people criticizing some of the lyrics and these people got too much time on their hands. This isnt a prog band with spacey songs annd rush lyrics. This is overkill and its their metal genious that layers this album. Their is not one filler track here. The outstanding tracks are many but \\"wish u were dead\\", \\"old wounds new scars\\" and \\"all over but the shouting\\" are monolithic tracks that crush anything by the supposed big four. \\"Good night\\" is the hidden gem on this album and is so damn good it may be their best ever.
B00631VJIC|5.0|I started watching the first season and thought my husband would like it b/c we have HDs. We are now on Season 5 & love the show. I liked the music as well so I purchased the CD. I listen to it often and can't wait t o listen to CD when I'm able to ride my motorcycle.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|I love this movie and can't wait to watch it over and over again. Quick download looks great on meh kindle fire.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|It was an okay book.  Not one that I would want to read again and am not even sure at this point if I will read the rest of the series.  It seems like Nikki at some points was more into giving Rook a hard time then she was in solving the murder.  There were some clues as to which way Nikki was going but not enough to keep me guessing...had it figured out long before the book ended.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A really intriguing work, Stephen Chbosky has created well-defined characters and they stay with you long after you have finished the book.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|The movie is great. I'm not a fan of Megan Fox so I'm glad she was replaced in this one. The action scenes in this movie top all of the others by far. It's an all around great movie.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|This movie is anti-mind.  It begins with the idea that all of the thought and research of our best archaeologists, geologists, chemists, biologists, anthropologists, and many, many others regarding the origin of human life on earth is incorrect.  Whoops!  Darn it!  I guess we'll have to launch a trillion-dollar mission to space to find our creators!  Why do the two \\"true believers\\" on our mission to space think that all preceding research and thought on the origins of human life is incorrect?  Because \\"that is what they choose to believe.\\"  You see where we're headed here.<br /><br />The pursuit of our creators (they have the answers, don't they?) will not require any logic or consistency, however.  The aliens who apparently created man left a map, an invitation to visit them.  Following this map, this invitation, we arrive at the military outpost from which they intend to launch a mission to exterminate us.  They changed their minds about creating us, we're told.  We're not too sure why.<br /><br />Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, our protagonist, is unable to become pregnant.  Unless the baby is an alien.<br /><br />The leader of our mission to space, Meredith Vickers, has brought a special health-maintenance machine on board, for her use only.  The machine can perform surgery.  But it has not been programmed to perform specific surgeries that a woman, and not a man, might need.<br /><br />Removal of umbilical cord support of an alien fetus does not kill it.  For what purpose the alien fetus uses the umbilical cord, if not to provide life support, is unclear.  And, yes, immediately following surgery to remove a squid-like alien fetus from her body, a woman can return to space adventures.<br /><br />I could go on, and on, and on...<br /><br />This movie asks the right questions about our origins.  But it sees man as incapable of answering them through research and thought.<br /><br />If you're interested in real origins of life research, you may find two courses that are produced by The Teaching Company to be of interest.  The first is \\"Origins of Life,\\" by Prof. Robert M. Hazen.  The second is \\"Darwinian Revolution,\\" by Prof. Frederick Gregory.  (I have no relationship with The Teaching Company other than being one of their happy customers :-)
B0018QQQK8|4.0|As always you are kept moving along to an ending that you cannot predict. A good book to sit down and read to your wife or granddaughter on a rainy night. Not a tear jerker this time
B0012FHGCW|3.0|It was ok, but I really wanted to like this more.  It dragged for me and the character development felt a little forced, and though I sat through 2 1/2 hours of character development, I just didn't connect.  The shots were beautiful though, that gave me something nice to watch while the storyline bumbled along.  Sorry, Sean.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Riveting read!! I found this book to be as equally thrilling as the first one. Great book!!!! I highly recommend it.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|With each movie in the series, the choreography gets better and better each time. Definitely worth the watch, see it!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I heard this was great - and nothing else. I was blown away at this inventive, fascinating piece of work. Bravo!
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Elder Sign: Omens is a great port of the recent cooperative board game. The sound and video effects add to the overall experience, and the game is fun and challenging.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|All those people who played this game they probably think it's amazing,i do first I bought 4 but then like a week later 5 came out but it was totally worth paying six fillers on both I think 4 is cool but fives better there is new towers better maps and tons of new stuff so my opinion is this game is awesome!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What a ride ,  this book is incredible I finished it in 3 days I just couldn't put it down
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is really fun and the graphics are awesome. I highly recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a great time killer.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great for keeping mind active and getting through the labyrinth. love the increasing. difficultly as you go up the levels
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book in under 48 hours. The characters are engaging, the dialog is simple (can be a little cheesy and silly- but it's good!) and they mention all of my surrounding towns.<br /><br />There's a lot to love in this book. It deals with HEAVY stuff in a decent way.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The Hobbit was a fun read and I LOVE how Jackson brings it to life for us. The same awesome details we loved in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Love that they are finally coming up with powerful female characters instead of the pushover princess type.  This fiery redhead displays the challenges to being a girl, the rebellious streak, yet a coming of age dilemma in which she and her mother come to terms with their own biases and learn to respect each other for that.  I would add this, along with Mulan, to my recommended videos for young girls.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|If you love video games then you will love this! Fun for the whole family. Especially us old gamers.<br />Its also a movie about worth and acceptance.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Hard to understand dialogue.  too much action  not enough drama  plot was too simple  the beginning did a poor job of setting the stage
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game I highly recommend it to a friend and it's just great and like there are. No bad stuff about It and that makes it even better
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The only problem with this series is that I have to wait another year, to see Season 4!!  Love the characters and the plots!!  The English accents are not so hard to understand as some English movies and series.  I was surprised how quickly I became &#34;hooked&#34; on Downton Abbey!!
B0025W68JI|4.0|I was givin this set as a gift, and generally speaking it's enjoyable. All the \\"best\\" of his pieces are included, though some are not as well known as others.
078689136X|5.0|This was a fun read and since we had the TV series in our heads we could visualize the characters and actually feel like we were in the story with them. Nice book
B0095P29EG|5.0|Excellent action movie.  Good acting, good actors, good script, gets the adventure started.  Go see it.  Better, go buy it and then watch it.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Not as funny as the book. Padded to the point of unrecognizable. Can't recommend, despite Martin Freeman's good performance. .
B0066WJLU6|5.0|need to see where i am going. it's bright enough to be an aid. i would suggest this app. thanks
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Fun for the kids and for the parents. My son is 4 and he absolutely loved it. Love amazon rentals!
B00BF123WG|5.0|Riveting!  A  review of events surrounding the binLaden situation and telling of what we didn't know was going on behind the scenes.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I do like Justin and the three songs; Suit & Tie, Mirrors and Space Coupe are the only ones I listen to.  Can't really get in to the other ones....sorry.
B00540G3G6|1.0|While the 3D effects might have been o.k. the movie has hated by both my husband and I.  We could not even finish watching it.
B0076DELIG|2.0|A very good setup is wasted on a second half that feels thin and poorly thought out. It's also frankly, utterly preposterous and very easily worked out which is a real shame after the excellent first act.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|I'm not very good at interactive games and yet I like this one. It keeps me active as I make Ninja Joe jump, roll, and achieve his mission. I would recommend this game for anyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun for all ages. it gives kids the chance to be responsible without risking anything in real life
B00846WWVM|5.0|This game is so cute and clever. I love the little blue water drops. I also like figuring out how to put the fire out. This game is clever, cute, and fun. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B008602KQI|3.0|First let me say that I'm going to be one of those guys that compares the book to the movie. I understand that you can't have every aspect of the book in a movie or you would end up with a series (Game of Thrones), instead of a movie. But there is just so much missing from this movie. Most importantly, the emotional ties between characters is sorely missing. The thing that makes this story so good is that you have this hardened hero forced into a situation where every move not only effects her, but the world in which she lives. This makes the thoughts and feelings of that character as much, if not more important than the actions she takes. Unfortunately, this is mostly missing in this adaptation.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- A lead character that you want to root for. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job in this movie. She was a good pick for this role.<br />- Great visuals. Specifically in showing the differences between the Capital and the other districts. Although only District 12 is shown for longer period of time, you really see the contrast between the city and people of the Capital and the districts.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I know this somewhat unfair, but there is just too much of the story missing from this movie. I think they do a good job of getting most of the action in, but this story, as with most stories, is driven off who the characters are more than what they do. More importantly, since this is the start of a series of movies, the emotional ties between characters now is going to be very important later.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|This one is so much fun. Even though you are moving your fish from spot to spot it seems to be soothing too. I really like to make my fish move fast. I would recommend this one to anyone.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great acting, interesting plots, good suspense, unexpected endings, good story line,<br />interesting insight into politics and the tough legal business
B00942X8PY|5.0|I really like this game. I enjoy figuring out which way I'm supposed to go. This is a good game for the mind.
1608871088|5.0|The book is very nice and have a lot of new information about the movie and the characters.<br />The art is very cool and beautiful.
B007L5GDGW|4.0|I really like this game, but I do find it difficult to keep the marble on track. I am sure if I was a few years younger it would be no problem. Having said that, I still like trying to get past each stage.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great. It is scary because it could happen. r y r y r y r y r y r y
B008VIKLWA|5.0|To see chimps live in the wild is an eye opening experience. Outstanding film quality and highly educational. Gives a new meaning to the phrase bugs on a stick!
B000VYNYN0|3.0|like i say in my head line it was more funny then anything. Was what I excepted from an movie made during that time.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|While I didn't like it, my wife loved this movie. For me the story was too slow and never grabbed my attention. I stopped watching half way through. That said, it was nominated for an Oscar and is a highly rated film. The acting and picture quality were good.
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked this film a lot in the movie theaters and the book was get to watch it again can not for the second and third books to be finished.
B0068AWQQ2|4.0|I didn't think this was as good as the original Fright Night, but there is one great bite scene worth seeing.I wish they expanded on the first bite scene more too. This updated version had potential. I loved it taking place in Vegas. The newer plot and actors make this title very likeable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for gamers as it exercises your thumbs so you are prepared<br />For any other game. I love subway surfers and I think you should make a prequel to what happened before and who was chasing them?!<br />I love this game, and whoever says it's a copy of temple run, who cares? I don't, so thank you for making this game, Kate
B00A6CT012|5.0|Love Bea, love her writing style, and love what I learned. So excited to start the zero-waste adventure and make it the routine in our household.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|bad I play minecraft. all my life and I counld not do 1 thing. bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My son totally love this item...It is a great product and suggest that you purchase it for your child as well.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Love the perspective of a parallel Monster world.  Like most all Pixar movies, very entertaining and well done.  My kid really liked it too.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app simple and easy to use. The large numbers make it easier to read and not hit the wrong buttons. I'm recommending this to all my friends.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Excellent.  I am addicted to this.  I can't wait for the next season to come out.  I simply love it
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. After reading Lone Survivor and enjoying that, I felt as though I needed to read this book for a better ending and I'm very glad i did.
B0050G3NWG|3.0|I have bought this twice.  I am not giving a bad review but what I am complaining about is that there is no volume.  Very disappointed.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I tried to watch this movie, but I just couldn't finish it.  It is in black and white.  The main character is obsessive and seems really mentally ill to me.  He didn't engender any empathy as he is pretty unlikable.  I did like the main character's mentor, but you don't  see much of him.  I did feel sympathy for the neighbor girl, who wants to bring him out of his dazed reclusive rejection of all things human.  I did not enjoy this movie.  I did not finish watching this movie.  An hour was about all I could take.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It is a changer in mood and so detailed. You have to read it for your self and be amazed
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is actually quite entertaining.  My daughter loves horses and now she loves this game.  Not a bad game for being free!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is a really good book and very detailed. Definitely worth reading in my opinion and all the other books are worth reading also.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Graphics were great. Puzzles were challenging, and the storyline was fun. There were even a few times I jumped from surprise.
B00499NHLC|5.0|It is a testament to Doyle that his character has stood the test of time and reinterpretation.  Moffet and Gattis pay homage to the author's original works with clever writing and Cumberbatch and Freeman are perfectly cast as the updated characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Her writing could technically take some improvement. However, I love the idea of such an emotional cripple beoming the HAE Prince Charming.  The series was a great love story.
B0036SUQWA|4.0|I have no option of simply rating this without typing a review and it irritates me  more than mere words can say
B00AB7HESI|5.0|bought this game for my kids DS a few years back and I spent all vacation playing it!!!!<br />highly recommended.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time.  It was filled with humor and tragedy.  I cannot wait for the 2nd book movie to come out.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Liked how she used a lot empirical evidence to support her arguments and gave thoughtful examples. Good food for thought.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Great story and amazing use of technology if that's what it was.
B000LB0M8S|5.0|I am using this fan to cool down a wireless extender.  As such, it's currently double-sided taped to one vented side of the extender, blowing inward.  In this configuration, I'd estimate that it only emits roughly decibals in the low to mid thirties.  I can only be heard during the nighttime when all else is quiet.  If you hold the fan without forcing it to blow/suck through anything it's silent.<br /><br />For those looking to cut down on the noise profile even more, know that this fan will not autostart at 5v.  At 5v you'll need to manually give the fins a spin to get it to rotate on the low voltage.  But, at 5v it's moving practically no air, so it's useless.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I couldn't keep track of all the things that I follow if it wasn't for this software. Years of page saves neatly organized into categories where I can find them as needed. Highly Recommended for those who write or blog.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is the easiest to use mobile calculator I have seen.  Very colorful and accurate.  I find myself using it three to four times daily.  Also glad to pay a small token for the pro version to avoid the obnoxious ads.
0670026603|5.0|Mandy's Review:<br /><br />Louisa lives with her family. Her mother doesn't work because she has to stay home and take care of Louisa's grandfather. Louisa's father has recently been cut loose from his job. Louisa's sister works, but has decided to leave to go to college taking her son, Louisa's nephew, with her. So, that being said, Louisa's check is the main source of income for her family. When she loses her job at the cafe, she panics wondering how her family's going to survive.<br /><br />When she gets a job working for the Traynor family, Louisa's not sure she's exactly the right person for the job. She's not a nurse, has no degree, and is pretty much skill-less at everything other than working in a cafe. But because her family needs the money, she decides to stick it out. What she never anticipated was becoming fond of Will.<br /><br />Will's life has taken a complete 180. Once a successful businessman and playboy, he is now wheelchair-bound and has lost his freedom. He's a complete quadriplegic. When he first became an invalid, he tried to commit suicide several times. Finally, he's talked his mother into taking him to a place in Switzerland that helps people die. Her only condition is that he give her six months to prepare. He doesn't want to wait but agrees to her condition.<br /><br />Searching for someone full of life, Will's mother hires Louisa to keep Will company and remind him that there are reasons for living. Louisa's not aware (at first) that her sole purpose in being hired is to change Will's mind about dying. When she does find out Will's intentions, she's hell-bent on proving to Will that quadriplegic's can have as active a life as able-bodied people. Two things happen during Louisa's mission: her long-time boyfriend Patrick comes to resent Will and the time Louisa spends with him and, much to Louisa's surprise, Louisa falls in love with Will.<br /><br />Even though the reader knows Will's intentions of dying, you're constantly hoping that Louisa can change Will's mind. You're constantly looking for signs that Will's finally accepted his fate and that he's willing to give Louisa's love a chance. When you realize Will has no intention of changing his mind, your heart breaks yet you begin to understand why. What would any one of us do in his situation? If you were used to traveling around, skiing, being active, and then all of a sudden were left dependent upon others for every little thing ... would you be despondent and ready to die?<br /><br />I was able to handle my emotions well until the last few chapters of the book. Once it was clear that Will was going to follow through, I cried. My heart broke. I felt as if my soul tore a little. Please don't think that this book will be any less emotional for you just because you know what's going to happen. Read it anyway. Especially if you enjoy emotional stories with depth to them. This book has become one of my favorites, but one I cannot read very often.<br /><br />*A hardcopy of this novel was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
0786939532|5.0|First book in the early history of the Drow warrior Drizzt Do'Urden. Born into the underground culture of the Drow (dark elves) Drizzt seems incapable of understanding the evil that his culture is founded on. He is trained to be a warrior and becomes the most formidable fighter in the great drow city. His own innate moral sense is challenged, but not destroyed by the cruelty of his culture. Finally, when he only pretends to kill a surface elf child in cold blood, he is forced to flee the city into the deadly regions of the Underdark.<br /><br />This is the first novel in the Dark Elf Trilogy by RA Salvatore. It gives the story of the birth and training of the great fighter. It also gives us an insight into the culture of the Drow. It is the perfect place to start reading about this hero. Drizzt's rejection of his own heritage and the willingness to abandon it all show him to be a true hero. This is classic Sword and Sorcery Fantasy. This novel is more than fancy sword fights. At its core it&#8217;s about seeking out truth and taking responsibility for your own destiny, even if the whole culture is against you.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have had issues with sleep most of my life and stumbled upon this app while looking for free games. I tried it and now weeks later I look forward to listening to the layers I create each night. The wind chimes, butterfly, music that starts with a d, and the ocean sounds are my favorite. Also,I can leave it running all night with no issues for my kindle. I turn it on for my 6 year old son and he falls asleep more quickly. Then I get it back when I go to bed. It really is great :)

TEN got their most famous songs like EVEN FLOW and ALIVE, but VS is as inspired as TEN......in my opinion, PJ never come close to recriate such inspired songs.....ANIMAL, GO, DAUGHTER, REARVIEWMIRROR, DISSIDENT......WOW!!!!

Well done, PEARL JAM!!!!!! this one deserves BRAVO! BRAVO too!!!!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. One of the best books I have read in the last couple of years, and I am an avid reader. The book is very touching and beautifully written. I found the prologue to be a bit confusing and difficult to read and almost quit there. But I am very glad I kept on reading. It's an excellent book.

B00003W8NM|3.0|Bought used. Description did not mention the small scratches on disk so a little disappointed at that. Cover ware was present too
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a great book and I loved it! Better than 50 shades of Grey but along the same lines. The characters are well developed and the writing is really good, along with the storyline.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this since the era has never appealed to me.  However, all the clumsy things the leaders of the world did or did not do to avoid WWI reminds me of now and how we will never learn?  Great characters and stories.  I just ordered the second  book in the trilogy.  I hope I can't put it down either!

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like it; it's simple, easy, and the most useful and innovative feature, the 'ribbon,' is unobtrusive.<br /><br />I'm using it on a non-Amazon Android device, which might explain why it  launches slowly for a calculator app. Still, it has no flaws that would prevent me from using it.
B002413TY2|5.0|Action packed film with cool cars, good actors/actresses, a beautiful Ukrainian girl,  and a good story line. Jason Statham at his best!
B000FA675C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I love how Dan Brown made you feel as if this was real life and that 'maybe' there are all sorts of hidden treasures (material and knowledge based) out there for the finding.  I found this book to be very engaging from front to back and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mystery story.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|great acting by jonny lee miller and lucy liu, very, very natural between them.  i know there are sherlock series' on bbc and pbs (which I've never seen) but i have a feeling they are a lot more dark and &#34;heavy&#34;.  who needs more of that in their lives and worlds!  this is just an enjoyable, well-done, show that my husband love to watch together.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|I enjoyed this one quite a bit, it is funny and entertaining. The plot line gets a bit unreal at times but it does so to help the story. Great characters.

B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Too gritty and &#34;dark&#34; for my tastes - the future depicted is a bit too dystopian for my liking! Karl Urban seems to be channelling Stallone - I thought his voice sounded like he was doing a Stallone impression. It is hard to get a sense of his emotions since most of his face is pretty much hidden behind the mask. The MaMa character, played by Lena Headley, seemed to be a bit of a one-note and over the top. Given the brutality and seeming lawlessness of the &#34;judges&#34;, it was hard to root for the protagonists. On the positive side, it moved along briskly to its gory conclusion.

B00BQ1DAHC|2.0|I'm incredibly sad about this album.  I'm a long-time fan and have absolutely enjoyed their unique rockabilly metal sound for years.  Not sure what sound Volbeat was going for here, but it certainly sounds TOO AMERICAN.  I wonder if it has anything to do with their new AMERICAN guitarist.  (By the way, I am American.)  Most of the guitar is typical American boring riffs!  Looking back to their album &#34;THE SOUND THE STRENGTH THE SONGS&#34; , where every single song was amazing, I feel like this &#34;new&#34; sound/album of theirs does not measure up.  In fact, it's a far cry from their past works.  For years of listening to Volbeat, I would often think how awesome it was to finally hear music in America that didn't sound like every other band here.  Volbeat's unique story-telling rockabilly metal was off the hook… and certainly not present in this album.  I saw them here in California, and their show was unbelievable…. Glad I decided not to go to LA to see their recent show.  BTW… I still love Volbeat sans this album.
0553582038|2.0|*** Spoiler Alert. *** Most readers in this genre know that JRR Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings, and submitted it to the publisher, as one complete novel. It was about 1200 pages, this was the mid-1950's, and books of that size were simply not published. So the publisher split the book into three volumes. During the 1960's, there was an explosion of interest in LOTR, and thus began the onslaught of 'me-too' trilogies, beginning with Terry Brooks and so on. My point, which I'm wandering away from, is that the high-water mark for high fantasy (LOTR) was conceived and written as one complete, cohesive story. GRR Martin (whose name smacks suspiciously of marketing, but never mind) did no such thing with the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. He has written each volume after the last has gone to print. I'm guessing he had a good, solid outline for the first three volumes, but only a vague idea as to what would follow. Thus we have volumes four and five which essentially do nothing but tread water, waiting for a plot to appear on the horizon.<br /><br />Honestly, and boo me if you like, I read the first few chapters of Feast for Crows, read some reviews here, and put the book aside. I had just read the first three novels one after the other, for the first time (the HBO series convinced me to give it a shot). What do we have here, in these three books? First, it starts with a Prologue indicating that there are Undead beings living beyond the Wall, so the reader must assume this is the direction we're headed: dealing with this threat. The Enemy has been introduced. Then \\"Game of Thrones\\" begins, and we get drawn into a fascinating medieval world. It's going to be a Sword and Sorcery tale, and a damned good one, we think. But then, for most of the three books, it's just Sword. Betrayals, backstabbing, incest. In short, nearly 3000 pages of squabbling over the right of royal succession. By the end of book 3, all the main adult characters are dead (except for Cersei and Jaime). The war over succession is done, the Lannisters have triumphed. The Sorcery/undead Prologue material seems to have been forgotten. It would have been very interesting to see how these power-mad wanna-be-kings dealt with an invasion of the Others. It's what I expected from the first pages of Game of Thrones. It never happened. I had no interest in reading what had devolved into a YA title, with 13-year-olds as protagonists.<br /><br />Instead, what we have is a novelization of a RPG (role-playing game), or--perhaps more apt--a game of Risk. In Risk (for the one or two of you who have never played it), the object is to conquer the world, represented by a map. Like the huge map in Stannis' castle. Imagine the scene: it's a snowed-in family gathering, and Uncle Edd suggests a nice, long game of Risk to pass the time. Not long into the game, however, Uncle Edd grows bored, and gets his teenage son Robb to take his place at the table. Then there's a break for dinner. Afterwards, Robb and cousin Joff decide to head upstairs to play some video games, leaving just the younger kids to finish the game. Aunt Brienne is a good soul. She hangs in there, even though she's got only a few countries and no chance of making a difference to the game's outcome.  Aunt Serrsey, well into her cups, is hell-bent on winning, and keeps the kids rolling the dice late into the evening, well past their bedtime. Eventually (Risk games with seven players can easily go on for many hours), Aunt Serrsey holds most of the board--though not all--and the kids are willing to concede. Who cares anymore? is their feeling. They head up to bed, whilst Aunt Serrsey, uncorking yet another bottle of Pinot Noir, yells after them, \\"Tomorrow! I'll finish you all off tomorrow!\\" The kids groan. Cousin Bran mutters to Cousin Arya, \\"She'll be sleeping off her hangover till noon. Let's go sledding!\\"<br /><br />A good story of any sort has to have a goal, and a resolution. With the end of book 3, we sort of have that,I guess. Things have returned to stasis (and remain there for the next 1000-page-book-expanded-into-two-to make-more-money-for-the-publisher-while-GRRM-tries-to-figure-out-how-to-end-the-series). I began Feast for Crows, and realized I had lost interest in the story. I think it's because the story originally, as planned, was to end with book 3: a \\"Tolkienesque Trilogy.\\" But the money was rolling in, a TV series began, and there's nothing a publisher (or an author) likes more than an unending series that keeps showing up on the NYT Bestseller list. Seems like a case of Jordanitis, to me. The Wheel of Time that keeps rolling along with no purpose other than to make money.<br /><br />Here's my guess as to how the 7 (8? 9?) book series will end. Tyrion becomes King of the Realm. Dany and her dragons arrive, and FINALLY the Walking Dead begin their attack. What kills them and keeps them dead? Fire. Bring on the dragons. The Wall is brought down by the Magical Huge Horn, the wildings are brought into the Kingdom, Cersei gets her just desserts somehow (gruesome and satisfying, I'm sure). Dany dies, just to surprise us and add \\"realism.\\" Besides, Tyrion has to end up on the throne. Peace comes to Westeros, as King Tyrion and his queen, Sansa, toss the Iron Throne out the window.I guess.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|After seeing the movie Jack Reacher, I wanted to read the books. This first one is a great introduction to the series.
0307887448|5.0|My husband bought this book and I picked it up when he was finished. I didn't expect to like it, since I don't read scifi at all. I loved this book! The story is well written and the characters are so alive. It's a dystopian future that is not so unreal that you can't see it happening. Cline's commentary on the online life gives this story a wonderful undertone that I enjoyed immensely. Even if you don't read scifi, try this one! It'll change your mind.

B008K7RGA2|5.0|This all-star production is absolutely the best there is. I've seen Tosca many times, the first one in 1964 at the old Met with Renata Tebaldi, Tito Gobbi and Franco Corelli. I own three DVDs, two with Domingo. I can clearly say this one outdoes them all. I could watch it again and again, it was that good. I just showed it to my opera group and the reviews couldn't be higher. It's really a hard act to follow.<br /><br />What makes this Covent Garden production so good are the quality of the singers and Jonathan Kent's brilliant stage direction. You have an all-star cast. Angela Georghiu is the ultimate diva. She really is into her role and sings and acts beautifully. Jonas Kaufmann, who is really a Wagnerian heldentenor, handles the lighter Italian role of Cavaradossi with incredible sensitivity, and is able to tame the hugeness of his voice with genuine warmth and beauty. Bryn Terfel, who I really never liked as Wotan in Wagner's Ring or Mephistopheles in Gounod's Faust, brings the house down as Scarpia. This role is made for him and he really becomes Scarpia so much so that I forget I'm watching an opera (he's really revolting), but his performance is so gripping that you leave Act II wanting to take a shower. Jonathan Kent's stage direction is incredible, for example, after Tosca sings her \\"Vissi d'arte\\" and the audience goes wild, there's a silence on stage as Scarpia slowly and contemptuously applauds her \\"pity-me\\" performance. It is startling - I've never seen it done before - and it changes the whole mood onstage. Brilliant!<br /><br />All in all, I would buy this DVD before all others. It's a truly great Tosca on all levels, even surpassing the wonderful Domingo recordings. This is the best it gets. It's also a great way to introduce a newbie to opera. I actually converted two of them in my opera group after watching this production.

The texture is excellent, it fits comfortably in the hand and the buttons are all in easily reachable positions. My only complaint is the color customization. While it's a stellar idea, I wish the scroll wheel's color could change from blue, instead of just customizing the anchor symbol.
B00BF11STU|2.0|My husband and I go to a lot of movies.  And we really don't find much value in movies that have far more profanity than needed in them.  It can wreck the entire movie content.  Is it any wonder that our young people and children are growing up using profanity like it's a &#34;cool&#34; adult thing to do?  The other day we heard on the news that a large percentage of young children learn a swear word before they learn the alphabet.<br />We don't remember much of this movie, but we do remember all the profanity in it, so that's what we share with other possible movie goers who ask our opinion....&#34;don't go, its not worth compromising your distaste of hearing profanity.&#34;

His neighbors, humorous characters themselves, try and help him out with suggestions as to how to solve his problems.  It's a funny, sometimes sad, ride and I highly recommend it.
1416583432|5.0|Read this and never look at your dog the same way again.  The author takes us into unexplored territory that educates regarding vision, smell, cognitive behavior, etc.  Communication through movement, eye contact, and touch are all known by dog owners but I suggest that each of us will, at some point, have a tear in our eye as Alexandra Horowitz explains in depth what our four legged friends are capable of expressing through their gestures.  I consider this a must read for anyone who loves his dog (and who doesn't?) and wishes to better understand and nurture his or her canine companion.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Do Not Buy This Set! Very cheap dvd's that skip and don't even play half the time. The resolution is terrible and I'm playing \\"the ones that do play\\" on my PS3.

0345803485|4.0|I really like \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" despite all of the negative reviews listed here, and would recommend it highly to anyone who is comfortable with the idea of discussing difficult subjects, like sexuality and BDSM.<br /><br />For those of you who have lambasted the book, let me say that many of your criticisms are unfair. If you want highbrow literature, read American and British classics, or read novels like \\"Magic Mountain,\\" \\"Anna Karenina,\\" or \\"Les Misérables\\" in their original form (i.e., in German, Russian, and French, respectively).<br /><br />Let me also say to anyone who thinks a teenager could have written \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" really? I highly doubt the possibility of such a feat; the writing (see pages 290 through 292) is far too slick and sophisticated for an adolescent mind.<br /><br />Is \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" perfect? In a word, \\"no.\\" In the beginning and middle of the story, E. L. James relies too heavily on clichés to propel the action forward. While I can appreciate that Anastasia is a carefree, naïve virgin with passive-dependent and passive-aggressive tendencies and is someone who is at the mercy of her blossoming libido and curiosity about S&M, there are other, more creative ways to convey such attributes while moving the story along. Furthermore, in the dialog between Christian and Anastasia, E. L. James overuses the word \\"murmurs\\" to a noticeable degree. However, I'm not offended, as some are, by the excessive use of such endearing and humorous exclamations as \\"holy cow\\" and others employing various expletives. E. L. James may have used such phrasing to reinforce the idea that Anastasia is, what, a country girl from Georgia who is out of her element and held captive by her powerful and unexplained attraction to the extremely handsome and exceedingly wealthy Christian? Also of note is the absence of Appendix 4, the food list (mentioned on page 172), which should be part of the submissive's contract, but is unwittingly omitted from thenovel. Oops! These and other minor writing gaffs (including the use of the word, \\"subconscious,\\" instead of the more correct term, \\"conscience,\\" when E. L. James refers to Anastasia's inner life) I blame on the editors who should have paid more attention to the manuscript before rushing it to market.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest objection to the book by would-be critics is the impossibility of Christian's immense wealth at such an early age and his apparent lack of work ethic for someone who is clearly obsessive-compulsive. My eyes did roll around a bit when E. L. James slid over Christian's business credentials and the genesis of his great wealth, all of which may be irrelevant to the story. In the real world rich, young entrepreneurs are so preoccupied with their business and technical pursuits that they have little time for anything else. This story-line fault can be easily corrected in a second-edition rewrite by having both Christian and Elliot be the sons of an extremely wealthy eccentric who has spent his entire existence building his self-made empire, who marries later in life to a young, beautiful woman, and who then tragically dies in an airplane crash, leaving Christian in charge and Elliot as the chief operating officer. E. L. James could then devote several pages outlining the raison d'être of Grey Enterprises, Inc. and its mission to save the Third World from starvation.<br /><br />Easily missed in the pervasive fog of condemnation is the overriding theme of the book, which I see as the need for compatibility, compromise, and accommodation in any romantic relationship in order for it to work and for any two people to be truly happy. We all have our soft and hard limits, right? But what about the most basic need for finding the right balance between closeness and distance in the sharing of feelings between two people? How many of us get that right or know how to communicate our deepest desires to our partner, as Anastasia tried to do? Besides, don'tmost marriages go through some type of power play in which one spouse attempts to exert control over the other in one or more areas of the relationship? Doesn't Christian try that with Anastasia but blows it? If he were truly a skilled top, for example, wouldn't he have spent a lot more time warming Anastasia up before applying more intense stimulation?<br /><br />At any rate, how can anyone truly condemn a novel that addresses, in a humorous, frank, and perhaps dramatic way, the issue of compatibility that seems to plague so many relationships? Too bad that so many of us do not think as I do that \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is, indeed, a book that has merit.

B00C2VIA52|3.0|This is not bad per se, but it isn't very good either.  My biggest complaint is the User interface.  It takes several attempts to activate spell cards.  Also, like most free games you quickly run up against decks that have better cards than you have access to without spending real money.  (Or going back everyday for weeks to get a random uncommon or rare card that may not even go in your deck)
0316023744|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this history of World War II because of the wealth of detail on all fronts of the war.  The author covers not only the European land war but also the warfront in Asia.  I have especially appreciated the chapters on the Eastern Front  of the war between Germany and the USSR.  Political and military leaders are interwoven in the presentation.  For a one volume treatment of World War II, I was impressed with the scholarship and writing style of the author.  I plan on buying some of his previous works.

B00C7L8DM2|2.0|This movie looked promising when we watched the trailer. We also like Aaron Eckhart, so we went ahead and rented it at the high rate.<br /><br />Whoever did the final sound editing for this movie absolutely ruined it. We could barely make out the dialogue because the musical score was so loud relative to the speaking track.  We struggled throughout the movie to understand what was going on because the dialogue was so overwhelmed by the music.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this one.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|As my review for Book 2 says, I love the way the books changes perspective from chapter to chapter so that the reader really gets inside the heads of the characters, providing insight into the complexities of human relationships in a way you otherwise wouldn't.  More than it is a \\"fantasy\\" novel, it is a pseudo-history, and as we all know, history told from only one perspective is skewed and incomplete.  Martin's choice of multiple perspectives gives a very thorough view of what's happening and allows the reader to reach their own conclusions about what is good/bad, right/wrong, desirable/undesirable.  Although I'm a fan of the tv show, believe me when I say: THE BOOKS TELL THE STORY ON A LEVEL THE TV SHOW COULD NEVER EVEN DREAM OF ACHIEVING.<br /><br />The books also provide a good balance of pure pseudo-historical adventure story with subtle fantasy elements without being too in-your-face fantasy.  At the outset, the kingdom of Westeros believes magic and magical creatures no longer exist except in very subtle holdover ways, like the occasional witch-type character, but those are a rarity and viewed skeptically.  As you move thorugh the books, some of this supposedly dead magic turns out to be not so dead, but it's not like a Dungeons and Dragons world where trolls and wizards run amock.  So it doesn't have a \\"kitsch\\" problem the way some bad fantasy novels do. Now for book 3 specifics:<br /><br />We're still focused on the Stark family in many ways; as I hypothesized in my Book 2 review, the Starks seem to be the true focus of the overall story.  But other major players on the chessboard also become near and dear to the reader. In book 3, as the title suggests, we cover the \\"war\\" of the various figures vying for the throne and a fair amount of plotlines are ... resolved.  S*** goes CRAZY up at the wall, and Jon is becoming more and more of a central character, which I like since he's an underappreciated bastard and I tend to root for underdogs.  I absolutely love where Arya's story is going as well, and at the close of her last chapter in Book 3, I believe I shouted \\"Yeah!!!\\" at the top of my lungs, much to my dog's consternation.  Book 3 ends with a lot of balls up in the air and I'm dying to see how this all comes out.<br /><br />As far as actual literary value, I have no complaints.  The prose can sometimes be plodding with detailed descriptions of people's clothing (do I really care where the silk came from?) or the various courses of a feast (yum! but let's get on with it), but for the most part it is artful and eloquent.  Like Stephen King, he spells out the dialectic quirks in dialogue which makes voices come alive and makes the world they're in feel more real (poor uneducated people and fancy rich people speak differently? hey, that's like real life!).  He uses historical vocabulary a lot, which has made me grateful for the Kindle's built-in dictionary at times, but I think speaks to the level of research and preparation that went into it.  I'm sure that if I really put my mind to it, there would be phrases or pages that I could slash with a red pen, but only very few, honestly.  Even the tangential moments - during which I am anxious to get back to the action and find out what happens next in the grander scheme of things - have a purpose and feel necessary even in the moment.  The story is thorough to a ridiculous degree, but this makes it feel more real; it is so holistic in its attention to detail (in both physical descriptions and emotional/psychological insight) that you can't help but believe this all happened or is happening somewhere, somewhen. Ah, verisimilitude.<br /><br />It's not a love story, although there is some love.  It's not a true war story, despite the battle scenes, there is no identifiable hero or villain (there are definitely a few heroes and villains though) and there is no particular \\"quest\\" except maybe \\"achieving leadership who will protect the realm\\" (but that's a pretty lame quest if you ask me).  With humans fighting humans while a supernatural threat looms in the background, it could become more of an \\"us against them\\" in some later book, but that's not really the groundwork I think the author is laying.  It feels more like just a context for a foray into the virtues and pitfalls of humanity.  It could just as accurately be called \\"A Game of Good-Choice, Bad-Choice.\\"u ask me).

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|i like the game, its fun and addicting. For right now theres no complaints. I like the storyline and the graphics.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|this review really relates to the first 3 books: I love the way the series changes perspective from chapter to chapter. You really get inside the heads of a lot of characters that way, and I tend to believe that characters are everything in storytelling.  That's a personal quirk and not true for everyone, so take the rest of my critique with a corresponding grain of salt.<br /><br />I think there's a good balance of pure pseudo-historical adventure story with subtle fantasy elements without being too in-your-face fantasy.  It takes place in a kingdom that believes magic and magical creatures no longer exist except in very subtle holdover ways, like the occasional witch-type character, but those are a rarity and viewed skeptically.  As you move thorugh the books, some of this supposedly dead magic turns out to be not so dead, but it's not like a Dungeons and Dragons world where trolls and wizards run amock.  So it doesn't have a &#34;kitsch&#34; problem the way some bad fantasy novels do. (Need I mention the trite regurgitated Eragon dragon series so lauded by critics a few years ago? I mean, yes, it was good for being written by a 16-year-old, but that doesn't make it actually good.)  As I said, the &#34;magical&#34; parts are subtle and the characters treat them with uncertainty and suspicion.  The supernatural aspects are almost peripheral to the main plot, at least in Book 2.<br /><br />As with the first book, the subsequent ones focus on the Stark family, and we get chapters on all of them regularly (eldest brother Robb trying to be a &#34;man&#34; at 16; bastard brother Jon who was sent North to the Wall; the two sisters - one dreaming of being a queen, the other learning the art of the sword; 8-year-old Bran who fell off the roof early in the first book; 4-year-old Rickon who has yet to really develop as a character).  The children's connection to their direwolves continues to fascinate me; the animal on the family crest who appears to be connected to the family line more than metaphorically... This potentially supernatural element seems to solidify that the Starks are the true focus of the overall story.  But other major players on the chessboard of this &#34;game&#34; also become near and dear to the reader (Tyrion Lannister, &#34;the Imp,&#34; we love you!), even some who are less than admirable. Some of the surlier characters introduced as &#34;bad guys&#34; (Sandor Clegane, i.e., &#34;the Hound&#34;) have their heartfelt or compassionate moments (but not all of them - Tywin Lannister deserves whatever he gets!). Characters make good choices and bad; lots of bad things happen to good characters - it's really very engaging and resists dictating the readers' opinions (unless I'm being so subtley controlled I don't realize it, which is totally possible; I'm a pushover sometimes!).  At this point in the story, as may be plain from the title of book 1, various figures are vying for the throne.  I honestly don't know who I'm rooting for; there is definitely more than one compelling option.  The only thing all readers probably agree on is who shouldn't be on the throne (Joffrey, &#34;the Douche.&#34; Ok, I made that nickname up myself.)!<br /><br />As far as actual literary value, I have no complaints.  The prose can sometimes be plodding with detailed descriptions of people's clothing (do I really care where the silk came from?) or the various courses of a feast (yum! but let's get on with it), but for the most part it is artful and eloquent.

It's not a true war story, despite the battle scenes - it certainly doesn't resemble All Quiet on the Western Front, A Farewell to Arms, Catch-22, or any other &#34;war novel&#34; I've ever read; it isn't really making a commentary on &#34;war&#34; as an evil thing nor is it glorified (even though heroic acts in battle certainly are). Rather the evils of war are a given, but it is accepted as a necessary process to achieve eventual stability; knights are idolized for their ability to &#34;protect the innocent&#34;; their ability to decapitate with a single blow is merely the method of their brave and gentlemanly duty; of course, some relish it more than they ought to.

B009IA9OLE|1.0|Huge waste of money. I am so irritated that I spent $3 for this! It is nothing like you think it will be! You have points. You try &amp; take your opponent out with those points. Nothing more entertaining happens. So incredibly boring.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I have a lot of audio and video on my home server and before I'd have to download the file fully onto my kindle to play it (with the built in media player) but now I can stream directly from the server over my home network.  Haven't tested it from outside the home over an ftp connection yet, but no reason to doubt it would work.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I read the book for a good friend's book club. I have to say it took everything I had to get through it. It's very ethereal and colorful. The descriptions are a feast for the imagination. However, it's difficult to connect to any of the characters. I finished it on principle and solely for the language. This is not my favorite genre so take my review with that in mind.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|This movie is a classic. A great thriller with an interesting plot and a pretty good twist at the end.
030758836X|2.0|I wonder why some books get to be best sellers and others don't.  Far too often the books that people rave about are nothing special to people who read beyond the Top Ten Best Sellers lists.<br />This books is nothing you haven't read or seen before, if you have seen a few episodes of Law and Order, or read a few decent thrillers.  It does not have a ground-breaking plot, and the twists are not mindbogglingly original.  The writing, is average, maybe a notch above, but not stellar.  This is not what I expected when I read the book that no one has been able to shut up about for months.<br />The story is told in two voices.  Amy tells a story of how they met and their marriage up until their 5th wedding anniversary in diary entries throughout the years.  Those chapters alternate with Nick's view, starting on their 5th wedding anniversary, the day Amy disappears from their house in an apparent violent struggle.  Neither character is what they appear to be at a shallow first glance.  What made this book most difficult is that all of the main characters are totally unlikable.  The only likeable character is a detective with a very minor role. I will also say that Ms. Flynn's portrayal of Missouri is crap.  She may have grown up in Kansas City, but she obviously wrote it with the disdain of someone who would rather be anywhere else.  It may not be to everyone's taste, but it is not all backwoods rednecks and bumpkin cops.
B0034G4OYA|3.0|I gave my niece this for her birthday.  I guess she liked it.  I want to see it, but haven't got around to buying it for myself.  This rating will probably change once I do watch it, because it looks good and funny.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book provides a fascinating look into the complex relationships between the sitting president and past presidents. I highly recommend it for any history buffs.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's The Walking Dead, so obviously it's getting a good rating.  And I'll use this same text to review the other episodes I purchased.
B00847UYWA|4.0|I don't agree entirely with the reviews of this work by some of Chambers' contemporaries (that is, that he proposes fantastic concepts but fails miserably in doing so), however, like many of his contemporaries, the reads can feel somewhat dry or burdensome. Not so much so that it totally detracts from the reading of his shorts, but enough that the first few might take you longer than a normal short to plow through, simply because you're not sure when it's going to &#34;pick up,&#34; or start flowing better.<br /><br />The ideas are superb (plays that are the epitome of art and, thus, drive men mad) and if you give yourself away to what horror was at the time (read: suspense, tension, the tightening of the string, NOT just campy shock value moments), you can't help but enjoy the stories.<br /><br />The first is particularly impressive.

B000ID37RM|5.0|This film is a great film that records the strained and alienating relations of a dominant white society against African Americans in the 50s and the right for a trial and a plea for justice. Gregory Peck plays a white lawyer defending an African American who is wrongly accused of raping a white woman. While this film ends sadly, it nevertheless reminds us that injustice still exists today whether you are Mexican, Middle Eastern, or any other ethnic group that has suffered from the powers of white racism.

B006VFLIYK|2.0|An assassin works for a super secret branch of the government, lives in Washington DC and finds that there are enemies and traitors inside and outside the government who want to kill him and the president.  This has only been told in about a thousand thrillers.<br /><br />Make it 1001 now.  With the exception of adding the 14 year old girl there is just nothing about this book that hasn't been told over and over again.<br /><br />Some of the action is decent but again unoriginal and uninspired.<br /><br />The dialogue is just off and unrealistic.<br /><br />I really hope that Baldacci can soon get back to thinking originally or getting back to the Camel Club books.  This one is just the dud that comes along when an author starts writing too much or just for the money.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|this works. Nothing special.  I can't say anything bad about this except the price.  In a way devices that use this not too dense slow transfer card are a bit lik the inkjet printers that get you on ink.  We own one underwater camera an Olympus that uses this card.  We will only buy one card.  Too difficult and expensive to have spares.  But it does work.  Just a bit slower than sd cards costing one third as much.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Had heard a lot about Jack Reacher and Lee Child however had not read any until a few weeks ago.  I loved it - well, graphically written, which had my brain imagining all sorts, the plot was so interesting it kept my kindle pages flying over.
B008602KQI|5.0|I felt this movie was well written and it makes me want to see what happens next. I enjoyed how the story flowed in and out of action and it wasn't all about the battle and the characters were developed well enough for me to care and want to see what is going to happen in the next movie.<br /><br />Not knowing anything of the series I am excited to see what happens in the next one. I believe the next movie is Catching Fire, if it follows the books anyway ,and I can't wait.<br /><br /> I had never read the books so I can not compare, but people I know who did said it was still enjoyable to see. I would recommend this movie for early to mid-teens and adults, not that it's overly gory or bad but the story I think is more geared toward that age. Not going to go into plot or anything I think it's worth seeing so I won't give any spoilers. I have yet to meet anyone who said they were disappointed in it or thought it was bad. I would pay to see it again which is rare I'm kinda cheap when it comes to movies and music. If you are on the fence and cheap like me, it's free on amazon prime instant now (Apr.14,2013) so get the free trial and watch it. I hope this was helpful. I don't write reviews often but felt this movie was good enough that I would give it my endorsement for what it's worth. I know I would have not watched it if someone didn't recommend it to me.
141659521X|5.0|This is the best Flynn get - I'm not going to spoil it, but the rhythm of movement in this book is a tour de force of plot. It starts out murky, and then accelerates explosively to have you wondering whether an impending earth quake is going to rattle your windows - YOUR windows, not the ones in the book.<br /><br />And as for those who say this the \\"same old,\\" Rapp should have a few minutes with you in the padded room - camera off. I suspect you may be agents from another publisher. So get nervous. :)
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I think  I may have seen all the shows, they will have to act overtime to keep up with me. Sheldon, Penny, Leonard, all of the Characters are really great. I'll bet they have a blast making the show. Everyone I talk to loves this show. No violence, mediocre sex, and lots of laughs. The way America is suppose to be. I hate violent shows.
B00BWJ91XK|1.0|The Lord of the Rings seris were all good movies. This movie though was a waste of 3 hours of my life. Horrible bad humor, the pale orc was clearly CGI at times, and the whole movie seems like it was geared towards kids. Think Jar-Jar Binks and how stupid and annoying he was, thats what I felt t times while watching this piece of Garbage movie.
030758836X|5.0|This was one of the better books I have read in quite some time.  Kept my interest right up until the last line.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I enjoyed imagining how Lincoln and his family might have been.  However, this story is more about Lincoln and Congress passing an emancipation bill.  There are a lot of characters who undoubtedly are famous in history.  Just not to me.  The language of the time and the way that Lincoln spoke were as if in some kind of Shakespearean code.  I've read two books on the assassination of Lincoln and both did a much better job of holding my interest.  It's two and half hours of Lincoln's party collecting votes for the 13th Amendment while conducting a naval attach while receiving a Confederate peace delegation, all at the same time.  Lincoln admits that some of his actions might not be quite legal and that he has assumed that the Constitution has conferred him undefined \\"war powers.\\"  I have the book.  Maybe reading it will help me to understand the video better.  I would only recommend this video to someone who is a fairly serious Lincoln admirer.

I am not an emotional person.  People close to me are often surprised when I have outbursts of emotion.  The fact that this book drew these reactions from me warrants 5 stars and my reccomendation. &#34;damning and brilliant.&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not as good as the first two in the series, but still a good ending and some good reading. .
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is an interesting app that i really like and i personaly think you should get it keeps you busy and gives you something to do and think about
B007IXWL2C|2.0|All three of the books were totally unrealistic and were reminiscent of women with the Cinderella Complex.  It was totally predictable and boring. It just was not believable. The characters never seemed like real people. The author is living in La La Land. I liked some of the sex toys, but the sex scenes did not get me hot, which means the author failed me. I would not recommend this trilogy to anyone!!!!
0525952926|5.0|Yes, I would recommend!  It is lengthy but Ken Follett keeps you involved in the lives of all his characters.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|It took my so long to get hooked into this book...but I did....eventually. I felt it could be abbreviated a bit earlier on to keep the momentum going.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Very few functions I cannot due on my tablet vs computer. I have this on a Kindle Fire HD-32gig.<br />Its a little glitchy at times when clicking on links, and often going link to link.<br />It switches to my browser when on a link, if I'm not signed into fb on my browser first and use the app for access, I cannot comment on links websites. It keeps trying to make me sign in but errors because I already am signed in automatically via the app.<br />Other than that, for updates and commenting on posts its great!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|As a physician deeply indoctrinated in the eat less, move more, low fat, high fiber mantra, Mr. Taubes' clear presentation was initially hard to process, but SO worth the effort.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|I like simulators. This has both on board and radio controlled camera views which makes it fun for more types of people.<br /><br />Provides plenty of fun and challenges.<br /><br />Not designed to be a training simulator, just to inform those looking for that.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was an unexpected great read!  I bought this book because it was an Amazon &#34;sale&#34; item.<br />It's a great story, and I read the whole thing in 2 days. I liked it so much, that I went and bought another book by the same author.
B00A3OT34M|5.0|I really liked most of the songs on this CD. I am a big Pitbull fan and this album did not disappoint. Buy it....
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I think it's important to judge movies (or books or anything else really) not based on what I want them to be, but what they are attempting to be. And that's particularly relevant here.<br /><br />Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not a direct adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved children's story The Hobbit.  And if that's what you want, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />This is a prequel to the movie trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Something that became apparent within the first 15 minutes of the movie. It's clearly framed as that. If you didn't like those movies... you won't like this one.<br /><br />It is not a stand alone story. If you want something that is complete in and of itself... you won't like this movie.<br /><br />On the other hand. If you enjoyed The Lord of the Rings movies and you like spending time in that vision of Middle-earth there's no reason why you wouldn't enjoy the prequel. Visually this is clearly the same place and while the tone is lighter you can see how it would progress to the darkness of LOTR.<br /><br />A lot has been made of the fact that a small children's book has been turned into three movies. To be honest I always thought it would need two in order to be done thoroughly. Because the Hobbit at some 320 pages (depending on the version you have) is not actually that short. Most movies if directly transcribed would really only make up a short story.<br /><br />One of the pleasures of An Unexpected Journey was that everything was there. It was frustrating to me in the Lord of the Rings movies that so much had to be either skipped or rushed (and I'm not even talking about Tom Bombadil who I don't particularly care for). That isn't a problem here.<br /><br />In fact the humor and lightness of The Hobbit is actually present in the film, particularly in the earlier scenes. Complete with songs. And yes we get Dwalin, Balin, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur, Fili and Kili and of course Thorin Oakenshield all introduced in suitable and largely comic fashion.<br /><br />And it's a huge credit that despite the huge number of dwarves, many of who are not terribly distinctive even in the original text and who in some cases only get a few lines of their own, each of them does seem quite distinctive.<br /><br />But what Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boyens have done is to blend those lighter elements into the grimmer back story. We get to see what was going on while Gandalf was not with the dwarves. And this isn't just made up. It is based solidly on the material in the appendices from The Lord of the Rings. I should know, I read them often enough.<br /><br />Perhaps that is why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I love that material and I loved the time it got here. I loved that they were able to finally slot Radagast in after he was removed from the original trilogy.<br /><br />Speaking of Radagast the Brown, he had some of my favorite moments in the movie despite that being perhaps the biggest stretch from any actual Tolkien text. Yeah maybe they over-egged the drug user references with both the pipe-weed sequence and the mushrooms comment, but Sylvester McCoy honestly did some of his finest work in this movie.<br /><br />By this point the Tolkien purists will be ready to strangle me I'm sure. But this was not a movie for the purist.<br /><br />Tolkien in fact would have hated it. But then I suspect he hated most movies. He disliked technology, he didn't like noise and generally speaking he was a grumpy stick in the mud. And the movie wasn't made for him either.<br /><br />The introduction of the additional material actually helps the narrative considerably. In truth The Hobbit is a story about a bunch of random events that are tied together with references to luck and fate. By emphasizing the back story we get an enemy and something driving the plot forward.<br /><br />There are some liberties taken with characterization. Probably less than in The Lordof the Rings but the dwarves in general and Thorin in particular are less incompetent than they were in the book.The same is true of Bilbo here who by the end of the movie actually stands up for himself.<br /><br />The party are still heavily dependent on Gandalf to arrive in the nick of time and save the day. But you do get the feeling that if he hadn't they would have gone down fighting rather than totally ineffectually.<br /><br />What you're getting here isn't a children's movie. It's a modern action movie. Complete with scenes that might have appeared in a video game. Jackson's signature swooping camera is very much in evidence and the scale of the sets is huge.<br /><br />In terms of acting, Ian McKellan is of course always brilliant. And of the dwarves Kenn Stott as Balin in particular just nails his role. In fact if I had seen this first I would have been much more affected by the tomb scene in Fellowship of the Ring because you can feel a connection between Balin and Bilbo and you can see why he's respected.<br /><br />James Nesbit as Bofur, Aidan Turner as Kilie and Richard Armitage as Thorin all excel in their roles as well. And of course there is Andy Serkis returning to the role of Gollum.<br /><br />The Riddles in the Dark sequence is another of my favorite bits in the movie. A tense sequence that blends comedy and tension right down to the ending.<br /><br />Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!<br /><br />Which brings me nicely to Bilbo Baggins himself. As portrayed by Martin Freeman. Freeman gets to use his comedic chops throughout the movie, but also has to dig a bit deeper for some scenes. And while some of his mannerism, the same ones we saw in The Office and Sherlock are there, within the first 40 minutes I was watching Bilbo on screen, not Martin Freeman.<br /><br />Which brings me on to time. This is a long movie. The running time is 169 minutes. So almost 3 hours. I can see that in the cinema I might have found that too much. But sitting in the comfort of home with the ability to stop whenever I wanted to get a drink or use the bathroom, I had no trouble with the length at all. The movie kept me interested the whole time.<br /><br />So where does that leave us?<br /><br />I loved the movie. Enjoyed all of it. Purists will hate it. People who just wanted The Hobbit will hate it.  Some people may well find it too long and just not be as interested in the Middle-earth background as I am.of the Rings but the dwarves in general and Thorin in particular are less incompetent than they were in the book.The same is true of Bilbo here who by the end of the movie actually stands up for himself.<br /><br />The party are still heavily dependent on Gandalf to arrive in the nick of time and save the day.

B00973902K|5.0|this song is so catchy that as much as you want to get it out of your head you can't.
B009S33I68|5.0|The book is much more detailed than the book that really only covers the initial 2 day battle!  I highly respect the insight provided by Hal Moore!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|The movie gets 5 stars from me - but this DVD does not. I saw this movie twice in the theater & pre-ordered the DVD. When I got it, I was extremely disappointed & shocked actually that in this day & age, how can a DVD not be surround sound? Especially when the sound (music) is kinda what it's about?
B008D28HYS|5.0|A nice straight forward and simple game with engaging puzzles. I have finished the first level and subsequent levels appear to be more challenging.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Stunning action flic which is full of suspense and surprise . I was spellbound . Avoid this movie if bloody violence offends you.Outstanding film. I highly recommend.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I would like to &#34;Thank You&#34; for this DVD. This was a Christmas gift for my friend & her familly. It was shipped undamaged in great condition. The DVD's were not damaged & in great condition. I would order from this seller again, also recommend them to my family & friends. I would like to say I couldn't find you to give you your 5 star rating. But, I found out my 90 days expired to give you a proper review.<br />Thank You Very Much:<br />Laura J. Loe
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Our whole family loved it! Little ones to big ones. Very well done storyline. Lots of laughs and great character development.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It's interesting plot line aside, Life of Pi is chock full of religious insights and inquiries. Its &#34;Fight Club&#34;-esque ending will make you want to pick it up and reread it as soon as you finish with the last page.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|By the time the book was 80% over I was bawling my eyes out. It takes a lot of rational thinking to get through the book , but it was honestly the best book I've read in awhile. It describes how strong this your cancer survivor Is so caught up in this love that she knows will end too fast. I couldn't put the book down. Well done John green, well done
B000FC12SM|5.0|I read this book many years ago.  I was too young, or too stubborn, or too foolish, or to stuck on me to really absorb the information objectively.  I purchased this for my Kindle and reread it.  Now, older and maybe a little less stuck on me,  Dr. Gray's information on male and female behaviour and thought process/perception made a strong impression on me.  I am trying much harder to be thankful to my husband.  I am asking him if he \\"would\\"/\\"will\\" do something.  I am trying to not explain or offer help a lot.  If he asks a question I try to keep the answer brief.  I say if you want help I'm here ready & willing, just let me know.  And then leave it alone. I can't speak for him, but I am happier. My better understanding of the male ego explained by Dr. Gray has helped me understand why my husband does certain things a certain way.  I find that he has been doing things just to protect me, help me, provide for me, and care for me as proof of his love for me.  I thought he was just micromanaging or controlling. This book also helped me see why I do some things and feel certain ways.  It seems crazy to say that, but sometimes I just \\"feel\\"- from Venus-what can I say.  This book is a much needed resource for all people, male and female, who are in a committed relationship and want to be even happier and closer. I recommend it highly.
B003WUYOQ6|1.0|Great book. If I could lend the kindle version it would be a 4-STAR book. Why is lending even possible to disable? I could lend, sell, or give a paper copy if I wanted to. There's no reason besides greed to disable lending. Shame on you, Amazon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Totally immersive, it draws you in from start to finish!!!The writing in season three is a masterpiece of suspense and Fear!!
0670026557|5.0|&#34;Give and Take&#34; is sure to become one of organizational behavior's most important books. Read it.<br /><br />The premise is relatively simple- giving (contributing to others more than you receive) is a recipe for success. While this may appear intuitive, Grant explains that structures such as required grading curves at universities and forced feedback in organizations make it difficult to give and be successful at the same time.<br /><br />Not so fast!<br /><br />According to &#34;Give and Take&#34;, there is a way to be a giver, maintain a sense of self-interest, avoid burnout,and protect against takers (those who tilt reciprocity in their own direction). This strategy is called being &#34;otherish&#34;. Grant explains the three prevalent social interaction styles that people use at work and in life, and colors his argument with riveting studies and anecdotes.<br /><br />This book appeals to people looking for practical tips and those with cerebral tendencies on the lookout for cool ideas to munch on. While reading, audiences also learn some interesting facts about Grant, who is a rising star in the field (and is also Wharton's youngest tenured and highest rated professor).<br /><br />I picked up &#34;Give and Take&#34; expecting to gain some clever insights about motivation and workplace behavior. After reading it twice, I am reluctant to put it down. It has given me a new world view.
B000SEI230|5.0|Day medicine, it really wasn't gentler.  The love shown between Landon and Jamie is rare indeed, and gives a couple today a goal toward which to strive.  The ending, although unclear as to whether Jamie lives beyond their vows, is the perfect ending.  Another great story!

B003KRJNBW|4.0|This is a very thought provocative movie!  While there is much violence, the ending leaves much to think about.  I have seen this movie 3 times & have now bought it & I have had many discussions with others that have also seen it & have different thoughts regarding the ending!  Denzel Washington, as always, gives a great performance.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app!! really delivers the real weather when and where it's happening!! I'd download it on pretty much any device :)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love the story line and I couldn't stop watching . I am on the third season. You must watch it.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The story itself was great...the ending not so much I wanted more. It feels unfinished. It would be great to know how the story played out.
B002APU580|5.0|I realize this film takes some liberties with the actual book by Jane Austin.<br />However, considering the number of &#34;more faithful-to-the-book&#34; film renditions of this title already produced,<br />this particular presentation of the story line -- with a bit more modern interpretation of events -- both my<br />husband and I found riveting and refreshing.  We feel the actual spirit of the original work by Austin has been<br />treated with honor.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Wish i could have my money back. Cursing child actors, cursing main actors. I suppose that is the new way to fill in a page of script when you lack a good storyline.  Not impressed and rather mad at myself for considering any film with Paul Rudd. He tends to personify  the kind of slacker father that should not be allowed to breed. if you can not stand these whining types of people in real life then you will only get about 45 minutes of your life wasted by this work of crap before you turn it off.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|This film is long, weird and doesn't come to any meaningful conclusion.  The beginning was amusing but the fight scenes were trite.  13 dwarves killing 100's of goblins bigger than them, not entertaining.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Loved this app, but it was running so poorly I decided to re-install it....now I can't open it at all!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Schindler's list follows the real life Characters Oskar Schindler and SS Lieutenant<br /><br />Amon Goeth. Schindler is a businessman trying to capitalize off the Nazi regime by purchasing manufacturing factories that make supplies for the Nazi army. Schindler uses these factories as a safe haven for the Jewish people in the Holocaust. Amon Goeth is a ruthless SS Lieutenant who is heartless, kills at his own whim, and he kills indiscriminately. Schindler has to make sacrifices in order to keep his factories going in order to keep them as a safe haven for his workers. He has to bribe Amon Goeth in order to build a sub camp for them instead of them being sent to a concentration camp. As the Jewish people are starting to be sent to concentration camps, Schindler does whatever it takes to stop his workers from being sent there. He pays Amon Goeth an outrageous bribe for each worker. A train of  female workers are accidentally sent to the Auschwitz concentration Camp. Schindler then bribes a camp commander with a large amount of diamonds. As the war comes to an end SS soldiers are ordered to kill the workers of the factory, once again Schindler intervenes in order to save his workers. Schindler is given a ring and a letter stating that he was not criminal in the eyes of his worker. He feels as though he did not do enough to save as many people as he could.Eventually after the war Amon Goeth is executed for his crimes.<br /><br />This film relates to World Religions because it realistically depicts all of the horrors and hardships that people in the Jewish faith had to go through. The film shows all of the brutality and needless killing of the holocaust.The film also shows some Jewish practices such as The Sabbath.The Holocaust was a major event in the Jewish faith and it affected the world as a whole.
B001FB55I0|4.0|Sam Worthington did an outstanding job as Marcus Wright, the convicted murderer who is given a second chance by the dying Dr. Serena Kogan in 2003.  However, Marcus's second chance begins in 2018 when he is awakened or freed from his Skynet cell for a special mission.<br /><br />Of course Marcus is unaware of his true, altered self and his deadly mission programmed into his brain by Skynet.  As the film evolves, the concept of what is truly human is examined in intricate detail.<br /><br />Michael Ironside as General Ashdown gave another stellar performance as the war-weary commander who wanted to end Skynet once and for all with an all out assault with a secret weapon.  Ironside always delivers a memorable character.<br /><br />Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, the most wanted man on the Skynet world, and his young apprentice, Star played brilliantly by Jadagrace added a nice touch to this CGI laden film.  You could say Star saves the day at the end of the film.<br /><br />There were a few new twists to the story which this film explored.  The scene in the manufacturing facility where John Connor is searching for Kyle was a surprise for fans of the first three films.  This was well done.<br /><br />Overall, the film is a good story told well and the CGI is well integrated into the human interaction.  The ending is not as surprising as intended since one could have surmised what the second chance motif actually meant throughout the film.<br /><br />The $200 million feature made over $371 million worldwide.  Terminator 5 will see Arnold Schwarzenegger \\"in the flesh\\".
B000002V1D|1.0|I remember how this album was critical reviled the time of it's released. Yet I see all these great reviews and it's really a laugh.  This is one of the worst Duran Duran albums they ever made.  The songs are all filler, cast aways that should have never been released at all.  All I can think is people are really nostalgic and want to remember things differently than the way they were back than. This album went Platinum on the strength of the two smash hit singles.  But within months this album was in every cut out bin that existed.  It was a joke, you could buy this thing for 99 cents anywhere (even the music clubs).  The album has two great songs on it period, Ordinary World and Come Undone.  How they could come up with two radio friendly songs like that I'll never know.  They haven't made a good single since. The first song on the album Too Much Information is also pretty good.  Otherwise the album is horrible, it's not even like a serious album.  I seen the tour as well and they hardly played a thing off the new album (only the singles).  All I can say is all the people starting in the late 90's through today that praised this album GET YOUR EARS FIXED!  This album sucks and you should wake up and top deceiving yourself.  I know you loved the 80's but pretending that crappy albums are great isn't going to bring it back for you anymore. Two great singles oh yea, my favorite two songs from Duran Duran since Rio.  But unlike the other reviewer I am talking about TWO SONGS, NOTTTTTTT the entire album.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|I loved this movie. As long as you go into it expecting to see a action packed, explosion filled shoot fest, you will not be disappointed. Acting was great, storyline tracked and the graphics were very well done. If you're a fine of scifi, action or end of the world movies, you will one happy movie goer.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The entire series kept me involved and intrigued. Each book is satisfying in itself yet link together for the conclusion. I loved keeping track of all the characters.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I rave about this show on a weekly, if not daily basis; even when it's not in season. You never know when characters are going to be snatched away from you, what will happen next, and the characters are built up very nicely. You really learn who each and every person on the show is and what makes them an individual. Some you learn to love, others you love to hate. And when all else fails, there is always copious amounts of zombie killing to keep people satisfied and entertained. I am a die hard fan to the end.
B003XU02QG|5.0|Great movie and terrific acting all around. It was exceptionally entertaining. I would definitely recommend it to any lover of ancient history and Roman colonialism/expansion.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Could not put this down.  Many twists that kept reader on their seats edge.  Many layers to the families involved
B009AMANBA|2.0|Maybe I have been spoiled by the superb work of HBO-with its superb rendering of David McCullough's JOHN ADAMS series, and maybe I watch too much PBS--but the silly opening of this film said it all. It was a prelude to the sheer sentimental pap that would follow. But it's my fault. I've been spoiled by excellent biopics and such and forgot that Spielberg did this silly mess. But I was still a bit surprised. After all, THE COLOR PURPLE is quite good, and SCHINDLER'S LIST is also noteworthy--but he does give us sugary sentiment served up on a platter here--one from the White House collection, to be sure.<br /><br />Again, the opening scene was all I needed to give me what I was going to be presented for another two hours. There's no way any black man in that time period would have had the temerity to walk up to any white man, much less, Lincoln, the President, and complain about white men making three dollars more than they. It was laughable. And cringe-able--these two black soldiers wax eloquent with Abe like he's Santa Claus and they just graduated from Harvard. Then we have two white soldiers, portraying the myth of the noble Yankees, of course, and their ridiculous discourse.<br /><br />Lincoln, and this is a fact, did not give one hoot about blacks. He was a white man of his time, and this was pure<br />politics of dismantling the lucrative South (and the fruits of slave labor therein) first and foremost.<br /><br />Any black person of this fair land will tell you that the Great Migration 60-70 years later was about finding manufacturing and better-paying work in the so-called Free North, foremost. There was no welcome mat for them, and certainly, circa 1860, no Yankee got up their firearms to defend them. It was about dismantling the lucrative agrarian south. The bit about defending slaves is pure whitewash (pun, unintended) myth.  And it's astounding, the denial in our collective consciousness applauding this hooey stuff about this very conflicted and complex President--who-- by the way, ordered the mass hanging of Native Americans for their rebellion against the White Man's unjust tactics in defending their United States. (This is a verifiable fact, so look it up, Spielberg).<br /><br />In conclusion: HBO, PBS--some plausible entity--now do the real story of Lincoln, please.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|I watched this show while it was still on tv, and the reason i bought this season was because i missed a few episodes. Im happy i got it cause now i can watch when ever i want and the simple fact that i cant get it anywhere in my small little town. That said there is a difference between season 1was and season 2, season 1is basically just entertainment, although it builds the storyline for season 2. Season 2was is where the show starts to use a story line and parts of the movies gets integrated into the show.

B00BLGXL3U|1.0|The acting was great, as was expected from such a lineup of actors. The storyline, screenplay, whatever may have been highly appealing for some from some perceived artistic noir dramatic level, but to me it was simply a sleeper.  The sex and nudity appeared to be thrown in for some voyeuristic effect.  This may have been loosely based on L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology, and for those interested I am sure they will enjoy this.  Just not for me.
B00005JKNF|5.0|i loved this.  highly recommend  as i think it would add to anyone's collection of British Isles' filming.  Go now!

B0059XTV4Y|3.0|There's lots of eye candy for those who like the gorgeous items that the royals enjoyed in the 1930's....like the folks who paid lots of money to buy them at Sothebys.  Then there are the pretty people and they are truly pretty.  The actors who played Wallis and Edward are both very attractive and of course, very well dressed.  As long as I let my eyes glaze over the surface of this film it was pleasant.  I didn't expect anything of significance and so I was not disppointed.  As the American Wally says, \\"Expectations lead to disappointment.\\"  One of the more meaningful moments was Wallis' dance to the tune whose words were something like \\"I am pretty, I am pretty, I am empty.\\"  That just about sums up this film.  Perhaps it sums up the lives of the original Wallis and Edward?  I won't dare to comment on Madonna's.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I have a 8.9&quot; Kindle Fire HD. The app has a lot of variety in the puzzles you can choose, and I like the many options for puzzle difficulty. The bad is that there is no option to save your puzzles in progress or to do more than one puzzle at a time. Frequently I'll take a break from a puzzle and return to the app to find it saying &quot;magic puzzles has stopped&quot; and my puzzle was lost. It's very glitchy and annoying. Also the scroll bar for the puzzle pieces is not very responsive. Often I'll have to try two or three times before it will scroll. The pieces in the scroll bar are quite small and there is no way to enlarge them, I have to strain my eyes to see them sometimes. If they fixed these few things I would be much happier with the app.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Child has the recipe for easy to read enjoyable action.No subtle literature here.Reacher (I never picture Tom Cruise) Shines as usual and impresses some females.You always learn some quirky facts,like how to talk for one minute without saying a word with the letter A.(read the book to find out!)
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Have only used it sparingly, once I figured out the controls, but accurate and well-worth the expense.  How about some WWII aircraft?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app was very easy to use and I love that it as multiple versions of the Bible.  Now I don't need to switch to a different app to read the same verse in a different translation.

B006C45LHA|4.0|An excellent concept well executed.  Daniel Craig with Harrison Ford? Brilliant! Olivia Wilde is perfect! Enough surprises to keep me watching. The special effects are not the greatest, but adequate enough.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Best game ever. Lots of fun. Love it &amp; nice game. A little scary. Slightly hard. Great thing for hints.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|These books kept me interested the entire time and are much better than the movies because they have so much more detail!
B002ZG98LO|5.0|This is a great film. I'm giving it 5 stars because it added such a cool storyline to the Predator franchise, and was consistently fun and highly entertaining throughout the movie. It never slows down, yet isn't frantic or over done. True it didn't break much new ground, but it did add new elements to the Predator. Possibly a sequel will allow the overall plot to develop so we can find out where the Predator came from, maybe go to the home planet, maybe start an all out intergalactic war or something. Hell, let's set it in the future and get Star Trek in on it! Engage. Ok maybe not. This movie is highly re-watchable. People complain about movies like this, but ultimately they are great additions that expand the story for fans. If it is on TV, it stays on that channel. This is the test of how good it was (for me at least). Replay value. Predator 2 wasn't a bad sequel, but I find it so far removed in style from the original it doesn't feel like a sequel. Still a good movie but I find if it is on I'll get bored after a bit.. The whole AVP thing is all over the map, and the Alien sequels after Aliens were pretty mediocre as well. I've seen them all multiple times and none of them (AVP or Aliens 3/4 really stand out). So this movie and Prometheus (and of no relation to Prometheus) breath life back into both franchises. Small *SPOILER* alert: there are some cheesy lines... \\"We're gonna need another plan\\".. etc, but the original was loaded with them. That actually is what helps create the connection. What is cooler though than a Yakuza samurai fighting a Predator with a samurai sword?? That was badass! I wait for this scene every time I watch it (and yeah it is basically a rip of Billy Sole's (the Native American) knife fight from the original though much cooler). And then there is the demented Lawrence Fishburne appearance. Another awesome sci-fi with L. Fishburne. Enough said. Hopefully they take this movie and run with it...
B00BTZNEN0|5.0|This album is amazing! Every song is great which is really rare to find. This might be their best album, but it hard to say because their first album was so beautiful as well. Also, they are amazing in concert!
0316228532|1.0|A Casual Vacancy, by J.K. Rowling<br />I gave this book a very generous 1 star.<br />What was this book about?  Hell if I know.<br />What was the main character's role?  There wasn't one main character, but a<br />flurry of un-likable, un-interseting characters that I didn't care about and<br />couldn't remember from chapter to chapter.<br />I usually give a book 100 pages to catch my interest, but because I am a huge<br />Harry Potter fan, I gave this a little under 200 pages and still I saw no<br />redeeming reason to continue reading the book.<br />But you are comparing this to Harry Potter you might say . . . . Not<br />against Harry Potter, but on the name recognition of J.K.<br />Rowling.  I would never have picked up the book if he wasn't HER book.<br />I went to Amazon.com to see if I was missing the plot of the story, and in<br />almost all the reviews there was no mention of a plot, but there was mention of character<br />development.  Well, characters without a plot are pointless, and added to<br />un-interesting characters, you have nothing at all.  Pass this book by and go<br />read a Williams Sonoma brochure . . . you'll like it better.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This app is worth downloading I love it... Don't have it then get it. The graphics are great on my Kindle fire hd.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|The plot was good but the main character was not totally believable.  I understand that she still had issues from her childhood but I still don't believe that an adult would allow herself to be munipulated so completely by a younger sibling.  And the things she allowed her mother to do at the end, she could have been killed herself.
B008XCM18Q|2.0|I gave this book a two because it was a really good plot however the author is a terrible writer, it seems he has no sense of editing. He uses God and Christ on most pages and then every couple sentences there's a metaphor that is a far stretch from applying in the situation. In lots of parts it seems as though he seems to have relied heavily upon a thesaurus and then he writes whole conversations in other languages without any form of translation, just to make himself look smart.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The mind of a sociopath at work for her own end.  The way she is able to recreate herself for every person and situation in her life.  But the fact that she was unable to recognize it in someone obsessed with her and actually went to him for help is very ironic.  The ending line was absolutely perfect...she thought she had everything back where she wanted it but realized that she didn't.

B0027MJU00|3.0|This was a bit more believable than the first book. The twist at the end was really unexpected.  If there had been a little more of the information on the search for the person from time to time from the one mention toward the beginning and the end result.  I could see where both of the surviving children thought they were doing the right thing but I am also glad she was finally able to find out the truth.
B000P0J09M|5.0|My five-dollar, bargain-bin movie for last night was \\"GoodFellas.\\" I first saw the movie when it came out in 1990. It was an exceptional movie then and it's just as good now. It was a story of the NYC mobster underground, their ways of doing things and their family ties. The looks of the cast and their social lives were absolutely authentic. Trust me on this one. I was going out with a Sicilian woman at the time, my best-ever girl friend I might  add, and we'd have a lot of social things associated with holidays and so forth. I got used to the \\"look.\\" Then, Theresa and I went to see \\"GoodFellas.\\" We both enjoyed it, but afterwards I remarked about how the people in the cast looked exactly like the people at her social gatherings. She laughed, and replied that it was a bit frightening. Well, I never detected any Mafia ties with her family, but a good-friend mainland Italian warned me to watch myself or I might end up with a horsehead in my bed. Funny experience.<br /><br />In any case, this movie was a quite good depiction of an extended Mafia family. The acting was excellent, The settings were first rate. Everything about the picture was first rate, although I got tired of the continuous pop music background. Even that was authentic and fit, I might add. The gang activity was certainly ruthless, so if you're squeamish be forewarned. The movie goes through the mob activities up  through and including \\"The Big Heist.\\" Here, order and discipline broke down and posed a threat to the entire organization. Those at fault began to pay in an expensive and dramatic fashion. It's a really  first-rate depiction of how a mob operates, and I wouldn't care to be a part of one.<br /><br />Well, what else could I possibly say? It got the \\"Best Picture\\" award and earned it. One minor irritation was that it was a very long movie and was split onto both sides of the DVD disc. At the break, I was so wrapped up in the movie that I couldn't figure out what the problem was. The disc needed to be flipped. It's the first time I ever had to do that.<br /><br />Gary Petersonto be flipped. It's the first time I ever had to do that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007HC3LHS|4.0|By alternating the story line between chapters, past and present are fused together to reveal how the main character's history influenced her current state of mind and her struggle to overcome it.  This was the first novel of Elizabeth Haynes' that I've read, and I will definitely search her out in the future.

B0070Y46UY|2.0|Just couldn't get into it. The writing about the animals is compelling but the major religious undertones were to distracting for a person who doesn't believe in God.
0684803356|3.0|Hemingway is great and it takes genius to stretch out three days of action into 300+ pages.However, I do not have the temperament to spend so much time reading this for 3 day's worth of  &#34;story&#34;.

1594746168|4.0|This book, which is actually two books combined, consists of a fictional biography (actually a fake biography about a fictional character-not a fictional biography of an actual person) and a second book is the fictional Surgeon's lost magnum opus: \\"The Codex Extinct Animalia\\" a \\"Gray's Anatomy\\" for mythological beasts such as dragons, mermaids, centaurs, Pegasus and Cerberus to name only a few.<br /><br /> The second the book arrived from Amazon Vine and when the package was opened, the book reeked of Gothic texture. The very volume itself seemed to give off dark vapors and scents of Edgar Allen Poe and H. P. Lovecraft.<br /><br /> Normally I only review non-fiction, but this pure fantasy slipped by me when I was making my two Amazon Vine selections. It's one of those books that if I had actually examined in a bookstore that I probably wouldn't have bought. It was interesting to thumb through, but otherwise it wasn't my cup of tea, or my poison.<br /><br /> The book uses some of the same techniques of writing fiction that was done so well by Michael Crichton. His fictional locations were so believable that at the end of the book the locations always had to be destroyed by burying them under miles thick lava or some other technique that would make them impossible to locate and visit.<br /><br /> In the fictional biography of this combined set, The life and Writings of Dr. Spenser Black is described in seven short chapters each one being another chapter in the Doctor's life: \\"1851-1868: Childhood,\\" \\"1871-1877 Marriage and Transformation,\\" etc. etc. The doctor was believed to be a grave robber like his own surgeon father.<br /><br /> In 1877, \\"Black speculated that perhaps the human being is not the best result of evolution; perhaps our ancestors shared traits with some of the ancient animals or, more accurately, ancient mythological animals. Black claimed that scientific evidence proving the existence of ancient mythological animals had been concealed by unnamed parties; taxonomy records were destroyed, constellation records were changed, fairy tales were altered and rewritten, all in an attempt to ignore our true history.\\" The doctor felt that the fact human beings might not be the highest species on the planet had been concealed from the public and was forced to exist only in mythology and fairy tales.<br /><br /> \\"The Codex Extinct Animalia\\" is the collection of Dr. Black's anatomy studies of mythological animals. Only a single copy has survived and is the source of the meticulous anatomical drawings in the volume.<br /><br /> The real author and artist of these two fantasy books is E.B. Hudspeth who lives in New Jersey and he may well be on his way to becoming a cult figure himself. He has a good imagination, a way with words as well as a talent with pen and ink and anatomy drawings.es; taxonomy records were destroyed, constellation records were changed, fairy tales were altered and rewritten, all in an attempt to ignore our true history.\\" The doctor felt that the fact human beings might not be the highest species on the planet had been concealed from the public and was forced to exist only in mythology and fairy tales.<br /><br /> \\"The Codex Extinct Animalia\\" is the collection of Dr. Black's anatomy studies of mythological animals.

B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Just started the diet and already amazed at the surge of energy and optimism after my fast. It is far easier to fast for the one day than I had imagined. Yesterday was  my fast day. I expected  to be ravenous for a huge plate of bacon this morning, but I wasn't all that interested in eating when I woke up. It has now been four hours since I broke my fast, and I'm still not all that hungry. Usually I'd have already had a snack and be anxiously anticipating lunch by now.<br /><br />I gave this book so many stars because the diet is so fantastic and  I appreciate Dr. Mosley's work in bringing the incredible benefits to fasting to light.The reason I didn't give five stars is because  it didn't give  much more detail then the video (which is free to watch on PBS). Much of the book is devoted to reviews about  th diet, but a simple google search with lead you to a vast number  of personal experiences and tips. I was expecting it to be more of a reference  book.

It's not perfect, but there so many gems within, especially the truly amazing tracks,\\" I feel so lonely, I could die\\"and \\" The Stars are out tonight\\", and \\" Valentine's Day\\".<br />It's an album which needs quite a few listenings before really getting its depth and multi-layers.<br />The album of the year, and maybe Bowie's best!!

B005LJITS0|3.0|I waited to watch this movie because I heard how terrible it was, especially the graphics. But...I didn't find the graphics to be that bad and they certainly didn't ruin the movie. The plot moved a little fast, but I think that happens a lot in a superhero's first film. I would watch it again and see a sequel. Not bad.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|As a conservative all my life I naturally believed that the government needs to cut spending to get the deficit under control even when the economy is sputtering or trying to recover from a recession. I also believed that getting the debt under control was the number 1 priority. I got the book just to see what the &#34;other side&#34; had to say and didn't really think I would buy into much of it. But Mr. Krugman layed out his case for more government spending in a factual and well reasoned manner citing historical examples to support his case. For example most economists credit World War II with getting the United States out of the Depression. This was a prime example of government spending helping the economy. So why wouldn't more government spending on infrastructure etc today help the economy get back to full recovery?<br /><br />He also showed why cutting spending or austerity would hurt our present but slow economy recovery. He cites the example of Europe where austerity has been the policy for the last 3 years. Their economic recovery has slowed to a standstill or some countries have slid back into recession. You need to increase demand by more spending. If the private sector is not doing it then the government needs to fill the gap by increasing its spending. That why he says the current focus on the deficit is harmful. By cutting spending now it will just hurt our economy recovery. The time to focus on getting the deficit under control and cut spending is when the economy is fully recovered. He also points out that the debt is not as big as some people would have us believe because the true measure of the debt is not the actual dollar amount but how big is it in relation to the size of the economy. Right now its somewhere around 80-90 pct of GDP. At the end of World War II it was around 125%. So in historical terms our current debt in relation to the economy is not at an all time high. He also pointed out that the debt at the end of World War II was never paid for because between 1946 and 1964 our yearly budgets either had a slight surplus or deficit. The debt however shrank as a percent of GDP. The post war economy boomed in spite of the debt.<br /><br />In summary, if you want to read a well written book in layman's terms outlining the case for more government spending to get us back to full recovery I would definitely get this book. It has made me rethink many of my conservative economic ideas.
B008NW67E0|4.0|This album is really good, but their first album is a little better. I would highly recommend purchasing this and their first (\\"Sigh No More\\"). If you are familiar with the album \\"Sigh No More\\", this one is considerably slower, but still super enjoyable!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 was way too short. Feeling let down ... I really hope Season 4 is better.  I don't want to give up on the Walking Dead.  I got sick and tired of &#34;the Governor,&#34; -- it seemed the show was too much about the villainous Governor and not enough about people trying to survive from the zombies.  The zombies became a sort of freak sideshow.  The main point of what was SOO incredibly magnetic about the show has faded in this Season 3.  Still loved it, love the characters, but I feel it's going in the wrong direction some how.  And if I knew exactly what I meant by that, then I would be hired as the producer / director or something important ... but really, I am just a critic, which means I can only tell you what the problems are, can't give you what the answer is.
B007REV4T8|2.0|The movie was definitely worth waiting for the DVD or download.  It defines \\"meh\\".  What saved the movie were the actors and director.  The basic plot was dull, bland, yawn.  The dialogue not much better.  If you have not seen it yet, wait till it is cheaper (read free).

B00AQKEPMI|5.0|This movie have all the ingredients to be a blockbuster although it depicted the regular  kids heroes in a new (and I have to say very different) light from Santa to the Easter bunny, The tooth fairy, the sandman, etc.<br /><br />for those who like to see more in a simple kids movie it teaches the concept of believing in yourself and find your &#34;center&#34;which is  what makes you who you are is it &#34;joy&#34;? &#34;hope&#34;? &#34;courage&#34;? The new guardian needs to find out his before becoming a &#34;Guardian&#34;<br /><br />Like in all Disney type of movies there always have to be a villain and in this case it is the Boogie man played in my humble opinion masterfully by Jude Law. It also reinforces the concept of team work  &#34;be a part of the team&#34; and not only individual an some times egotistical feats something in vogue nowadays. The guardians are a team the Boogie man stands alone so who do you think will  end up losing?<br /><br />My son - in my opinion a very good critic for children movies - enjoyed this movie a lot even though he got a little bit frighten by the Boogie man.  I took  advantage of his natural fears  to reinforce one of the focal points of this movie which is that  we will  always feel fear and that's a normal and healthy feeling but we have to overcome those fears because they make the situations and the things or people that oppose us stronger and bigger while taking our confidence away.<br /><br />That's in my opinion the value of this movie aside of the entertainment factor that in the end is what take you to the movies.<br /><br />It is a good movie with beautiful and well directed animation and a surprisingly good script and of course a happy ending.

B008JFUNYG|3.0|During the 1980's the pop culture ran film after film of Jason and Freddie. Real horror fans quietly turned &#34;Evil Dead&#34; into a cult classic with collectors DVDs selling up to $100.00.<br /><br />The remake has high standards to meet for devoted fans. Some fans claim it is not a remake, but if you use the same name and have many of the same scenes, it's a duck.<br /><br />1) The book has to be convincing. They did fine here.<br />2) The forest rape scene was a signature scene. This film didn't improve on it. One would expect with all the CG effects available, this would have been far better. It was worse. In fact there was a complete lack of special effects I was hoping for.<br />3) Bruce Campbell and a chainsaw. They didn't even come close. Jessica Lucas? Shiloh Fernandez? Please. They needed a name actor to take that role and write it with some personality. They didn't.<br />4) There was also a high amount of camp value to the original film series. This one eliminates all the humor. Seriously, where is the hand running around giving people the finger as in the ED 2? I think the whole movie gave the viewers the finger.<br /><br />If you have seen the original, you can wait to watch this as a rental. This won't make my collection as did the faux skin covered DVD. Having trashed this film, I will say if you haven't seen the original and know nothing about &#34;Evil Dead&#34; you might find that you will like this blood fest. My recommendation is to watch the original and &#34;leave this book alone&#34;.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex. Sketch nudity in book, mud nudity?
B0064MPXFA|2.0|Like the series except the political slant got to me.  Shame politics have to enter areas that should  be left solely to entertainment.  By politics, I'm referring to current real politics.  The writers' bias are obvious.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a awesome book it's about Greg having to find a date to a middle school valentines dance but he has a little trouble
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Well written. Enjoyed the ability to move from one book to the other quickly and with no delay. Enjoyed the story so far. Looking forward to the next ones.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and when I started reading it I couldn't put it down.<br />Excellent story feel everyone should take the time out and read this book.
B000VIPJKM|5.0|It doesn't matter how many years have passed by between seeing this movie, I always enjoy it. It's a fun, story and I think the cast was great in it. There's a moral behind the story too. Just because the woman is beautiful doesn't mean she is shallow or dumb. I loved this movie.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|This book was a great read. Really puts life goals in perspective. A woman who is obsessed with work learns whats really important in life.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I adore this game. the graphics are amazing and it's really fun seeing as I love these types of games
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Great lesson in history. The acting was phenomenal. Some argue that the movie was a bit long; I think it was just right for what needed to be portrayed from a dramatic and historical point of view.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|Tons of great stuff in this album, wasn't sure what to expect, just a random purchase - but I absolutely love it.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|i have just purchased a kindle and am learning about apps so i decided to try a few free games but with this one  you constantly have to get past the ads.looking to delete and try a different one.
B0019TYQ38|5.0|Have watched this film 10 times over the years. It's wonderful in many ways. Moves fast, never drags. The only scene I would change is near the end when Eleanor cries a bit too hysterically. Not quite believable. I love every other scene.  It's faithful to the wit and spirit of Jane Austin too.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is not a diet book, but if you follow the principles discussed you will lose weight.  The author clearly describes complex bio chemical processes and scientific studies.  You will never eat a bagel again.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I share this book with everyone who crosses my path while I embark on reading it again! What an incredible experience to behold and to think that we are fortunate to be able to share in the knowledge of this gift given to Eben Alexander through his full recovery and remembrance of his journey. I understand when he says his words will never be adequate enough to share the wholeness of what he learned by understanding we cannot even comprehend the enormity of heaven's vastness. To us, infinity is a word... in heaven it is a reality. As a parent who lost a child less than a year ago, Proof of Heaven has brought me miles forward in my grief. It has given me something I don't even have words for... just a knowingness that is shrouded in peace beyond my previous understanding. Thank you Dr. Alexander... I'm hoping there's a second book in the making :-)
B003G4W49C|5.0|I can't believe I haven't read any of these. It took me 6 days to read it, best book I've read so far
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A little heavy on the drama and loaded with emotion, but overall an excellent story.  It keeps you guessing until the end.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I quickly fell in love with this fantasy story set in an alternate middle ages. The characters are deep and I can't wait to see what happens to them in the next episode. This is a very violent time period and Game of Thrones depicts it quite well. It does not leave much to the imagination either. Sex and violence are graphically depicted and it most definitely earns an R rating. It is a great series though and from the first episode you're hooked. Game of Thrones Season 2 carries on the twisted story of the fight over power. Season 2 is not significantly different from Season 1, except that it will have you eagerly awaiting Season 3.
B0018RC7QE|2.0|They didn't really know each other. How could they leave their spouses for a stranger?<br /><br />I guess it was supposed to be romantic, but struck me a stupid, since they both had nice and supportive spouses and tossed them over for a stranger.
B003A3K3JW|4.0|One may initially flinch upon learning that the disc has two potential drawbacks: The performing ensemble is a youth orchestra, and DG made the recording live. Nevertheless, if you give it a chance, you may come to see that these possible handicaps are hardly detriments at all. For the present recording, Dudamel chose to perform The Rite of Spring, a piece of music tailor-made to fit his temperament and the orchestra's, all of them full of vim, vigor, and vitality. And that's certainly how they play the Stravinsky, for all it's worth. DG recorded the performances live in early 2010, but you'd hardly notice they were live until an unfortunate applause erupts at the end of the program.<br /><br />John J. Puccio<br />Classical Candor
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Ang Lee does a masterful job of bringing this story to life with beautiful computer animation.<br />Life of PI is about a man who survives a disaster at sea and is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an amazing and unexpected connection with another survivor...a fearsome Bengal tiger.<br /><br />The special effects are breathtaking and fantastically done.  Although the story does start a little slow, the story is masterfully told and keeps you entertained til the end.  The symbolism is amazing and gives you things to consider about which story you would rather hear.<br /><br />I highly recommend as it is worth a watch and a purchase.  Worthy of all the awards it has received.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Compelling. Pulled me through. Enjoyed the artful description. Took me to the places and made me feel the emotions of the characters.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a great read (bonus that it was only 99 cents!). I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope Andy writes more in this vein.<br /><br />Oh sure, the ending kind of simpered out by shocking poor mom and forever damaging one young person's psyche and there was a few jarring shifts in point-of-view that made me wonder if maybe Andy had a bad writing day or just pasted in some notes and forgot to remove them. But, even that was part of the charm to this book.<br /><br />A great read and a challenge to the reader to come up with a solution to the many problems that our hero had to work out.  I'll never look at a potato the same way again.<br /><br />I couldn't help but recommend this to a math teacher I know so he could use some of the situations in his classes. What if you were stuck on Mars...
B005HJAOLY|5.0|If you are a fan of Stephen's King's traditional horror Mile 81 is a neat story and a must read. As you would expect he masters character differentiation to perfection. This is horror that is genuinely frightening and a compelling read. The car in the story is not unlike Christine and has a malevolent character that shows no mercy to its hapless victim.
B0039HR5QS|5.0|One of the best Redford movies--the interplay with Faye Dunaway is outstanding.  Pure acting--no need for all the pyrotechnics & sex they overuse in today's movies.
B008220DGE|4.0|THE MASTER chronicles a man's journey for meaning. If you're coming in to this expecting a fluffy, sparkly tale where everything is wrapped up in a neat bow by the end or for pure entertainment purposes, you are sorely mistaken.<br /><br />This is a movie which unfolds slowly. The storyline, loosely based on the persona and ideas of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard (also channeled by the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman), deals with Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd taking troubled war veteran Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) under his wing, as Dodd's \\"Cause\\" spreads its message across the country. Aided by his fierce wife Peggy (Amy Adams), the enigmatic Lancaster starts off friendly enough, until his message is questioned.<br /><br />So much has been said about the performances, but it really does bear repeating. The three main leads are incredible. Amy Adams brings a fright factor I never thought possible, since she usually plays perky, upbeat characters. I think Philip Seymour Hoffman brings his A-game with every project he's in, whether he's being silly or dramatic, and his interpretation of Lancaster Dodd is no exception. But the really standout performance here is Joaquin Phoenix. No stranger to making troubled characters come to life, Mr. Phoenix is flat out phenomenal in this role, one of his best to date.<br /><br />The cinematography is gorgeous. The music is haunting and is never overpowering when it comes to what is happening on screen. While not my favorite film from Paul Thomas Anderson, it is a disturbing yet haunting piece. I can see why it won't sit well with most people, so again, be prepared for the storyline and the characters.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|I don't know why this is underrated. It is a bit confusing but it keeps the action throughout the entire movie. That is exactly what I want from a movie.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Facinating way to learn the history of WW I by following the lives of several characters from the participating countries.  Follett gives the reader a deep appreciation for life in those times.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Must Read!!!<br />Don't want to say too much cause I will give it away. It will hook you and have you wondering what will happen next.
B00B999E12|4.0|If there is one thing to expect with any Mike Patton release it is expect the unexpected, yes people will show up at his various gigs whether it be with Tomahawk, Fantomas or his Mondo Cane project and expect Patton to belt out Faith No More standards such as \\"Epic\\", \\"Midlife Crisis\\" and \\"Ashes To Ashes\\", of course each Patton project is unique and no two never intertwine. Recently Patton has turned his hand to scoring movies with much success whether it be the 100 miles an hour score for \\"Crank High Voltage\\" or the more string based score for \\"The Solitude Of Prime Numbers\\" and his latest score which is for \\"The Place Beyond The Pines\\" falls into the latter's category.<br /><br />If anything his latest score is his darkest yet, once again most of the tracks are short and clocks at just in over a half an hour in length. \\"Family Trees\\" has a dark eerie feel to it as it opens with operatic vocals and has a Fantomas feel to its structure. \\"Forest of Conscience\\" starts out tame enough before becoming hauntingly dramatic at the 36 second mark, this one is meant for listening to in the dark to give the listener a feel of unease! \\"The Snow Angel\\" is a lovely piano piece of music with some good effects thrown in around the track. \\"Handsome Luke\\" is the perfect dramatic finale for Patton's score as it features background noises and a big thumping sound to bring it to a climax.<br /><br />As well as Patton's score the album comes the album comes with four other pieces of music that are used in the movie but not scored by Patton including Bon Iver performing \\"The Wolves\\". It is really Patton's score that is the stand out though as it is dark and melodic. If you were a fan of Patton's work on \\"The Solitude Of Prime Numbers\\" as well as \\"A Perfect Place\\" you will enjoy \\"The Place Beyond The Pines\\".

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grsham nailed this one.  Plot unique with twist, turns and suprises.  Fast read,  One of the better endings of books we have recently read.
B004GYY714|1.0|I obtained this app to be able to listen to music while in Hawaii (limited radio stations)<br /><br />The app did not function correctly in my new ipad (newest model withe the latest version of IOS). You could not close the app or stop the stream.  The app caused my IPad to lock up.  I had to force a restart of my IPad together it to stop and to remove the app.<br /><br />I would not recommend it.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Finally a show worth watching from MTV. Not a reality TV crap show. Not a \\"let's glorify teen pregnancy\\" show. But a pretty close to normal show about high school life that has its twists and turns. I'm 34 and it still took me back to those HS days. Good job MTV.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|Interesting comedy without a love interest. Not one of Ford's greatest movies. The characters were all simple and uncomplicated which made them boring.
B000FA675C|5.0|It was a great read that intertwines fiction with reality. After you read the book, it still makes you think about the truth of things in reality.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|One of the best produced television series in a long time.  Kudos to AMC for having the guts to do something this edgy and intense, it really sets the bar high for Zombie features.

B00004R99L|4.0|It has the basic simple conflict of good vs evil. The main characters are likable. The music and songs fill in when there’s little acton to express the feelings of the main characters.<br /><br />The classics never get old. Disney tells a fascinating version of the fairy tale. The color, likable characters including the animals, and the wickedly evil ---- make for a captivating storyline.
B00ARI9CDQ|3.0|Interesting, but not much substance.  I just take a look on this site once or twice a month.  Too much headline fluff.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|It's Downton Abbey -- what more can I say? The program is stellar, and the DVD series is great to have in order to revisit the episodes while waiting for a new season to come out. I plan on buying Season Three as well. Love it!
B002Z0TPFE|1.0|There is not much to say, it was as bad as every other 1 star review explained.  I could not make it through  more than 25 minutes. Subpar acting, mediocre graphics, silly story. This movie was a great investment in that it saved me from spending 3 times as much on the sequel tomorrow.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|very cool. blocking little hardninnall the crazyness. action packed. good graphics lots killing. awesome that's its free will probably spend in game money
0767903862|5.0|This book is a travelogue that is written in a story form from the author's viewpoint. It was an exciting book to read and extremely informative. It talked about many areas of Australia that I hadn't visited or knew much about.<br />It has wetted my appetite to visit Perth and take the train from Perth to Adelaide.<br />The descriptions of the poisonous creatures left me wanting to stay in nice hotels and not venture into a camping expedition.<br />This book is entertaining as well as informative. It is a great way to learn about Australia.<br />- Bruce Raine, author of [[ASIN:B007BP9FP8 Attitude Determines Destiny]]
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Once you get the hang of it you can't put it down. I play on both of my kindle fire's, no problems yet. Hint go for the color,that's all I'm saying. Good Luck.
B00BB8Q13A|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The plot has taken Shakespeare and built a plot around one of his great plays, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\". It is very ingenious how the play builds up Shakespeare's writing of his original play.<br />I think that the characters are perfect in their individual roles. From Queen Elizabeth down to the little boy who plays with mice, all the actors are perfectly suited to their roles.<br />This movie was very funny but clever enough that I have watched it several times and keep getting a better understanding of it.<br />I highly recommend it.<br />- Bruce Raine, author of [[ASIN:B007BP9FP8 Attitude Determines Destiny]]
B00124PXW8|5.0|Excellent movie, kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. For a 1970's film, it was very well made, and the special effect were excellent, as well as a creepy score that set the tone of the film perfectly
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I downloaded the app because I had the original Andry Birds. This one is more fun because of the birds that fly away as well as the game gadgets. I like the new updated look and the game itself. Fun pasttime when you need a filler.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Love the story from the viewpoint of Enzo.  I do believe that animals know and feel a lot of what is going on around them.  Beautiful heartfelt story about good and those who truly believe they are doing good, but are not.  Great read.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|I received this item within a week of the purchase to an APO address. The speed of the shipment was nice to see, considering it went across the world to get to me. Upon watching the 3D version on a 3D TV I was just as impressed with the quality of both the HD and 3D as the first I saw it in theaters. I used a PS3 with HDMI cable along with the glasses to view it.
1476733953|5.0|I don't usually even write reviews, but this book was amazing.  There are quite a few moments that just spring up and leave you to think about what just happened.  One of the most entertaining stories I have read this year. Honestly I have just begun to get back into reading and was looking for some new and interesting books.  I saw this was on the NY Times best sellers and also very cheap for the kindle edition with over 4,300 great reviews already so I figured I might as well check it out.  I ended up finishing this book in about 3 days, I just couldn't put it down whenever I had free time.  Howey really immerses you in the lives of the people of the Silo, and the last part leaves you wanting more.  Which thankfully, there is more!  I got the next omnibus in the series Shift and am about 2/3 through it now and I know I will be waiting for the next piece to come!  After enjoying this book, I wanted to know a little more about the author so I checked out his website and some news articles, and found out that he is a really down to earth self published author.  He seems very loyal to his fans, personally even going to the post office just to get signed copies out to whoever orders from him at cost(even picking up extra shipping charges out of his own pocket on occasion!). I am going to check out everything this guy has written and definitely adding him to my list of favorite authors.  I look forward to much more to come from Hugh and I hope he keeps up the good work and stays cool.  I pretty much just wanted to write this after reading his comments at the end of the book, and it made sense about writing reviews for the books you love so that others may also find them.  I wouldn't have bought this had I not saw all of the reviews that were already here most likely.
B008NEMN0K|3.0|It shipped quickly to a non-US address quickly. I was a fan of this movie when I saw it in theaters;however, I disliked the 3D put into the movie. I used the same configuration as in other 3D movies I watch, PS3, 3D TV, and glasses of course. I would recommend the non-3D version for the price difference.
B00A77II0U|1.0|First app to not work at all on my phone! Tried to get answers and none come! Very disappointed! I would love for it to work since it looks very interesting!
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This story has a fairly suspenseful and interesting plot with some twists - some surprising and some predictable.  But the relationship between these two married people is beyond incredible.  Some suspension of belief is necessary in most any spy-type thriller, but the attempt to reconcile this couple's bazaar past with a &#34;typical&#34; middle-class-with-two-kid's existence, stretches belief way too far.  It takes away from the otherwise intriguing plot.
B002NVELDQ|5.0|This series is unlike any other on TV.  It captures the \\"traps\\" of mid-century America and how forward thinking we always think we are.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|I am only familiar with one other Nicholas Sparks story which was The Notebook which was bittersweet, yet enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoyed Safe Haven which is a book about a woman running away from an abusive husband.She hides away in a small town under an assumed name and meets a man who will become her true love. She meets his children that she also grows to love. The story gave you little about Katie's secret until midway through the book where we got to hear her back story. Then it really became exciting and tense when her psychotic husband sets out to find her and get his revenge. Up until the end, the book was realistic. But, the supernatural twist and slightly up-in-the-air conclusion just did not sit well with me. Otherwise, I liked it a lot.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I thought it was a fun game but everything has its ups and downws well for this one the deadrising mode the little allies are stupid they destroy that necronomicon thing you walk under when you spawn but that's my opinion if anybody likes the little ali ninja chick thing well go die just kidding
B0035LGXXO|5.0|It was actually a pretty terrible movie. I played the game and was curious as to what the movie was like. Rented it, it was painfully bad but I could see how it could be a cult classic. And the game actually plays off of the movie quite well, by showing the events that took place before the Warriors wound up on the run. I am such a big Warriors fan though, I bought a replica vest. I do not regret watching it, I'm glad I did. So now I can certify myself as a true fan, though the movie was bad.
B000002AH7|5.0|What's not to like its, Miles Davis.  If you are a jazz fan and don't have this albumn, you are not a jazz listener.<br />The album is a story sound track  to the play  DONKEY HOTEY<br />The CD got to my house before the delivery date!!
1400052181|4.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks was an easy, quick read. The narrative addresses most sides of the topic, and offers unique information about the cells and Henrietta Lacks. This book was well-written for its audience. The focus on Henrietta as a person provides background details that few know, given that the HeLa cells tend to be separated from the the subjective story they represent.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book was a really great all rounder, I read it in 3 Days, I would Recomend it to everyone
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a excellent app. Not as great as computer edition but mojang is working. It is a little bit pricy, bit it's worth every penny of it! You can build and survive<br /> The world is yours to explore!
B0082JYAZ2|2.0|Regina Spektor did not have to redo Ne Me Quitte Pas, period. Maybe because a lot of the songs are not new songs, but the whole album doesn't seem to flow as a whole. And they are not the strongest songs that she has written... I love Regina Spektor and I hope her next album will be a better one.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is almost like an ispy game and is perfect for any person of any age. I will issue a warning, if u are frustrated easily do not play.

B00B3MN65K|5.0|I think everyone should own at least one Josh Groban CD. His music uplifts and inspires me. I have listen to him nonstop for three weeks now.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Disclaimer:  I originally had no desire to read any of the \\"Hunger Games\\" books, as i considered them to be typical YA fiction - along the turgid lines of the \\"Twilight\\"  series.  However, after seeing the movie adaptation of the first book, it appeared that Ms. Collins had indeed created a work that was novel and not conventional, and so I decided to buy the trilogy.<br /><br />The first book certainly did not disappoint.  It was clever, intriguing, and presented its unconventional characters, (and the dystopian future in which they live) in an compelling  way.  The plot held one's attention and there were enough twists to keep the story from being too predictable.  Unfortunately, with the sequel, things started to \\"go south,\\" so to speak.  The heroine Katniss came out of the first volume as this (supposed) figurehead that might lead the people to rebel against the totalitarian \\"Capital.\\" While the opportunity was ripe to develop the political intrigue that would be inherent in this situation, Ms. Collins chose not to highlight this newfound power (and the fear of it by the Capital) in any incisive way.  Rather, she merely wrote a different version of the first volume: ignoring this new political aspect, choosing instead to have yet another \\"Reaping,\\" involving the same main characters as in the first volume.  As with many sequels, it appears that Ms. Collins wrote a very fine first book that attained phenomenal success and therefore, she had no choice but to come up with a sequel to satisfy the demands of her publisher and her adoring fans. While it appears that she knew where she needed to go with the book, she only knew one way to get there - by aping the formula if the first volume.  The only unpredictable aspect of it was a \\"cliffhanger ending\\" - guaranteeing yet another sequel.<br /><br />By the time the third volume came around, the heroine was supposedly the \\" face\\" of the rebellion, and yet one never feels that she really \\"owned\\" that.  She was still too caught up in the 'torn between two lovers' angst (so important to maintain the interest of all of those young female readers) to really take advantage of the power she supposedly possessed.. Again - Ms. Collins apparently knew where she wanted to go with the story, but unfortunately, the chapters skipped merrily ahead, sometimes making this reader wonder if pages were missing from his copy of the  book.  This ibecame particularly true in the last few chapters in which occurred  the climatic battle to take over the \\"Capital.\\" Yes - Miss Collins did provide one final, unexpected twist at the end, but then the story jumped waaaaay ahead and in the process, unfotunately, skipped over what could have been the \\"meat\\"  of the whole power-play plot; something that would have been worthy of a political, as well as action, thriller.<br /><br />While I know that this review is quite critical - it's only because I saw such interesting promise in the first volume and I was so disappointed to not see that promise fulfilled in the subsequent volumes.
B0012239EE|5.0|I bought this album and Closer, after listening to them I I bought all of them!! He has such an amazing voice.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The Movie:<br />The Hobbit is a good movie for those whom like the fantasy genre. Some people have issues with the scenes with CG creatures, not looking real enough or something. I don't have those same issues.<br /><br />The 3D:<br />I use a passive 3D TV and this is definitely one of my, &#34;See how awesome my system is!&#34; kind of 3D movies. There is no ghosting present, and the depth is good. Peter Jackson definitely did the 3d right for this movie.<br /><br />The video quality:<br />The picture is very clean, and the colors are vibrant in the shire. Definitely takes you back to middle earth from the Lord of the Rings, but it looks better doing so. I did not see anything glaring in the picture quality department.<br /><br />The Sound: It is great. The score is great, vocals are clean and easy to hear. The stone giant scene is appropriately boomy.<br /><br />Overall: I do not regret this purchase. In fact I think the film on this 3D Blu-ray actually looks better than when I saw it in the theater. Watching it on my TV is only way I want to see this film now, even if they re-released it in theaters. The only way it could possibly be better is if my TV was a 70&#34; instead of 55&#34; which has nothing to do with the Blu-Ray. 5/5 Stars for me.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Planning to have a marathon Halloween party when I get my the third season in....this is a great why to do that.
B0076DELIG|4.0|As always, an outstanding read from Michael Connelly.  Excellently written, tightly plotted, gritty crime drama featuring Detective Bosch at his best.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|What is true love? Steve Carroll, Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore and pretty much everybody else finds out in this witty take on the Victorian romance novel theme, with misunderstood messages, misplaced letters, true love, bored love, and ultimate...well, if not exactly happiness, certainly second chances at happiness. Highly recommended.
B007EDZ20O|5.0|If you are a believer of a religion, there is usually little someone else can do to change your belief, assuming you have enough &#34;faith&#34;.  If on the other hand,  you are a little more cynical, and tend to rely on facts, then this is a great book, that offers a quick, concise and entertaining view behind the curtain of public relations as it pertains to the Catholic church.<br />We have seen the &#34;slight of hand&#34; right in front of us, and you can choose to believe the magician made the card disappear, or you can choose to understand how the trick is done.<br />As always, Hitchens gets right to the point, and speaks not only of a huge public relations effort in the name of Mother Teresa, but also gives his own personal experience, first hand as he traveled the globe to investigate various efforts of a now,  beatified follower.  Hitchens may be the best &#34;devils advocate&#34; we had in our lifetime.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is amazing. The set, the characters, the story line.... Fabulous . I would highly recommend this to everyone !

B006TVQU6C|3.0|All in all this a good value case BUT cable management can be a issue for the unexperienced. final case: Good buy.<br /><br />9/24/2013<br /><br />While on routine cleaning of the case one of the fins from the stock fan broke. I ordered a new Antec Tricool 3 Speed 120mm Case Fan to replace it.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I love the sounds, and I love that I can have it shut off automatically at a particular time. It looks as though I should be able to make it turn on automatically, too, but it only does so intermittently. Very odd. Took a star off for that glitch.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Historically relevant but artistically mediocre.  The beginning was quite boring and the ending was anticlimactic.  A long 2 1/2 hours somewhat well spent
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A good game but the cost of boards are a little high but a fun ride<br />If I could find it for my desktop I would have better graphics.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This movie albeit probably quite realistic for some households had far too much fighting, swearing and controversy for my liking.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is an incredible story and should NOT be missed!<br /><br />At times completely terrifying and then uproariously hilarious, this story is firmly based on hard physics and math.  Being as I am neither a physicist or mathematician, it never gave me a WTF? moment.  The author drew the situations simply and the descriptions of them were very clear.  I was impressed.<br /><br />The author would be a BLAST at a party.  The protagonist must surely be the authors alter-ego.<br /><br />I completely enjoyed this book, cover to cover.  I wish every Sci-Fi fan would read this book.  Hard science fiction, humorously written.  WIN!
1433502410|5.0|Good study bible with tons of illustrations and notes and maps.  Perfect for doing my lessons for BSF!  It is a hardback so I leave it at home.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I liked this game for a while but then it got boring so I reset it. Still a very fun game; you should get it.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I needed something to connect to my firewall(s)(have more than one) management port (serial). My new ultrabook has only USB ports. Needed the adapter to create comm port for accessing the firewall. After following the instructions installing the driver, plugged the device in and it worked perfectly. I was able to program my devices without incident. I retrieved the drivers from the Plugable website. The only issue (and was not really an issue) is depending on which USB port I plug the dongle into, Windows may report it as COM3 or COM4. My system is a DELL XPS12 Windows 8 Pro Touch-Screen convertible. As little as we see serial port needs anymore today, when you need it, you need it. This product works as advertised.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This movie is not a bit funny unless cursing and crude humor is your idea of funny.  We kept waiting for it to get better and it doesn't.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money!
B0038AUY96|5.0|This was my first exposure to Jo Nesbo’s Harry Hole. If you haven’t been there yet be warned, the chances are you’ll get hooked – I did. This is a real page-turner in every sense of the word: fast-paced; believable, intriguing story; a vulnerable hero; building to a cliffhanging end. What more could you want from a novel in this genre. I’ll be back for more
B00C7KXUOE|1.0|This show bores me senseless, but I keep watching it, for whatever reason. I guess I figure I might as well watch it since it's a new show.
0345803485|5.0|1st... All I heard was read them, I'd heard so many bad reviews I didn't have any desire to read them, but everyone I knew insisted.  The 1st book I kept waiting for a plot other than sex... Did it get intense at the end, omg yes & I immediately started the 2nd then the 3rd.  Once u get past 3/4 of the 1st book u start to get it.... Yes some points in the other reviews are true but I don't think anyone who gave real negative comments finished the 1st book let alone all 3.  I loved them.  Beyond loved them.  Wish I could find another series of books ASAP!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I thought I already knew all I really needed to know about Steve Jobs from news & computer magazines & other biographies & just being around & an Apple product consumer since Apple II ... but Isaacson's excellent biography showed me how wrong I was.<br /><br />Isaacson makes the amazing Apple story & the 'cultural icon' but flawed human creator behind Apple, Next, Pixar, iPad,'iPhone come alive.  I think because of the many direct interviews & quotes.<br /><br />Like Steve Jobs not 'wanting an off switch' for his visionary creations, I did not want the biography to end.  A must read!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really loved this book and learned a lot about the period of time before the Civil War. I do wish I had learned more about the main character's background but other than that it was very interesting.

1607066017|5.0|Saga was touted in early reviews as being \\"like Star Wars\\", and it was by Brian K. Vaughn, author/creator of Runaways, Ex Machina, and Pride of Baghdad.  Couple that with a new renaissance at Image Comics, moving away from \\"superheroes with attitude\\" and embracing new, original series like The Manhattan Projects and Morning Glories, and Saga sounded like it should be a winner.  I even began reading it during my lunch break.  The opening page has a starting line of dialogue (which I won't spoil here) that's definitely a first.  But I continued reading.  A few pages in, there was an illustration of Alana, the mother of the narrator, breastfeeding (which is not presented in any sort of titillating context).  I moved on.  And a few pages later, there were robots having sex.  That formed my initial impression of Saga.<br /><br /> I had the pleasure of hearing Vaughn and artist Fiona Staples speak about Saga at the NYCC in 2012, and that only increased my enjoyment of this book.  It tells the tale of Alana and Marko, aliens from opposite sides of an intergalactic war, who have fallen in love and had a child.  Unlike the Skywalkers or the crew of the Enterprise (and perhaps more like the crew of Serenity), Alana and Marko abandon the war to raise their child.  They find themselves pursued by armies from both sides, as well as multiple intergalactic bounty hunters (wait until you meet characters like The Will, Lying Cat, and The Stalk).  This first story arc details their adventures in escaping the planet where their child was born.  Vaughn's writing in this series is as sharp and creative as ever, aided by conversational and realistic-sounding dialogue that a reader might not expect given the book's sci-fi/fantasy trappings.  I wasn't familiar with Fiona Staples before reading Saga, but I can definitely say I'm a fan now.  Her artwork is beautifully rendered and somehow manages to imbue the fantastical aspects of the story with a down-to-earth, grounded sense - and the gritty, harsh aspects of the story instilled with a sense of wonder.  Saga is highly recommended, and I can't wait for Volume 2.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series never ceases to entertain. It is great to be able to review missed shows on Prime and fill in forgotten details.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Great album! I love to sing along in my car. The group is great on CD as well as in concert, and I love their lyrics and music.
B003W5C0VC|5.0|I do not write summaries of plots, comparisons to books or my opinions on acting, that has already been done by a great many before me.  My reviews focus only on the quality of the audio and video transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />The video transfer was considerably better than I had expected.  I do have the Standard Def DVD as well but this is not a side by side comparison.  The cinematography becomes interesting to me and popped for me in this Blu Ray production.  While most of the color grading was warm, the evening shots were all shot with a cool blue and the transitions sometimes seemed abrupt.  There was good detail in the dark and shadow areas, yet there seemed to be a softness to the edging of many details.  This is only important to very few who might be interested in technical aspects of the transfer, which I am.  For the most part, the video transfer was just fine with excellent color saturation and a lack of noticeable film grain.  Contrast was also excellent and the colors in the daytime Florida scenes were stunning.  There was no aliasing or artifacts that I could see, and the Mbps rate was very high seeming  to average between the high 20's and mid thirties which shows in the clean transfer.  Whether this film was remastered or not, I cannot say, I don't think so, but the video transfer really appears quite clean.<br /><br />The lossless DTS MA 5.1 audio is the technical star of the Blu Ray with truly fine use of the front and rear sound stages.  I did not expect this to be so but there was a good deal of directionality with many of the foley fx and discreet channeling abounded, even if it was simply a subtle audio effect.  It's rare you get such fine audio with only subtle effects making it so. Usually we expect explosions and jets to provide those enveloping home theater effects but in The Red Dragon, it is left to the small bits and pieces of discreet use.  The LFE channel does some work in terms of contributing to the ambience and sound score.  5 Stars for the audio.<br /><br />The extras included several deleted scenes that I had on the Standard Def disc, a Making of The Red Dragon, interviews with Anthony Hopkins and a bunch of others that will take a long time to get through.  It also has a D Box Motion and BD Live features.  Is  there really anyone out there that uses BD Live?  It seems a waste of disc space to me that I would rather go towards improved video imaging, but that seems to be Universal's thing these days.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so hope they can assist you as well.<br />I do hope this brief review of the Blu Ray's transfer of Red Dragon has been of some help to you in determining your purchase.<br />Thanksars for the audio.<br /><br />The extras included several deleted scenes that I had on the Standard Def disc, a Making of The Red Dragon, interviews with Anthony Hopkins and a bunch of others that will take a long time to get through.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are awesome and this game is so addicting! Every thing is reasonable too. I love this game so much
B004B8DH98|1.0|My favorite part was when it ended, i just didn't get it. I expected more from s film that Clooney was a part of.
0785814531|5.0|Used to read these stories as a kid still the best even till this day.  Recommended if you have a dark sense of humor.
B005NNUKF4|5.0|The original album is super.  I bought this for the live versions and they do not disappoint, great to hear the extended versions with great playing from all the band members.
0743454537|2.0|Found the first half of the book to be an absolute chore to read; had to force myself to continue, hoping that an amazing ending (as I've read in some reviews) would make it worthwhile. Every chapter was narrated by a different character, so the point the ever-changing perspectives made me seasick. The characters (particularly the pyromaniac son) were stereotyped and extreme and the coincidences (the lawyer and the guardian are former lovers) were ridiculous. The courtroom scenes at the end got to be somewhat more interesting, and my interest picked up a bit, only to be smashed to pieces by an utterly ridiculous, easy cop-out ending.<br /><br />Two stars for an interesting concept; sadly the book does not do the topic justice.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is by far the quintessential zombie apocalypse book;  all other books in this category strive, and too often fail,  to match it.  My only fear is the upcoming Hollywood adaption of this great book (Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane??? yikes) hope they don't ruin it!
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Paramore just keeps getting better and better despite the obstacles along the way!! Love this album, every bit of every song in it

B00BWJARHO|2.0|There were some fairly interesting parts to this movie, but overall I found it to be boring.  I fell asleep several times.  It just seems to drag on and on.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I enjoy looking up remixed songs and downloading them with this app for free. It's fast and easy to use.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Not really what I was expecting, but overall it was not a bad movie.  They way some reviews made out.....it was going to be a spectacular movie, but it was not.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Amazing book!! As I began reading this book I was introduced to a series of small little stories.  Little did I know that they would be part of a bigger picture.  The story takes place in Russia. The story is about a MGB agent Leo and how his life is turned upside down.  Everything he believed in is pulled out from under him.  Without giving the book away Leo begins his journey to finding meaning.  I loved how every page is filled with suspense and paranoia.  Every event only leads to a new challenge and you just can't help but wonder if Leo would be able to overcome every obstacle that he must face. I loved this book so much that I finished this book in three days.  I just could not put the book down, and I just could not stop talking about this book. As I began telling someone about Child 44 she happened to share with me that this book is a trilogy and they are making a movie.  I was thrilled. I am going to be picking up the other two books. If you are looking for a great book this is that book. I received this book for free from bookbub.com.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great storylines, I love all the actors, they play off each other like they have been together for ever!. Wish they had more then two seasons.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|It captures your attention. It is a bit far fetched & somewhat hard to follow the altering timeline. All in all enjoyable, but leaves you wanting more explanations of what happened to the characters.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Very entertaining,although a bit tedious having to constantly click to upgrade. As well as all the separate posts that  need to be done.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Everything about this movie Is a 10. Diane Lane is amazing as is the rest of the cast. Photography and direction is exquisite.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's good, especially as you can leave it and it will continue, but the investment points annoy me as they run out very quickly
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I got this app for my 5 year old sister. She loves it, and I've seen her play it and she laughs whenever she gets a new pet. She likes the mini game where you clean them, and she doesn't complain about it. She also loves carrying for the pets, but I have to watch her to make sure she doesn't buy anything. Also, she's trying to have people add her. Her code is 317f53. Thanks so much!!!!!!! :)
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I new it was the best game ever.  Its better than mincraft.I love it.I don't have it yet.besttttttttttt. I would give it 9 stars
B000FC1CF0|5.0|I have been a sideline admirer of G K Chesterton, but the more I read his books, the more I come to the conclusion that he was a thinker and student par excellence. He was also extremely well read. His method of bringing over his message is totally paradoxical - he is known as the king of paradox, and that is why I enjoy his works and understand and like it.<br />You can read as much as you wish from other supposed rational books and apologetics , but when you throw them away and only read Orthodoxy, you need go no further. It is the first time that I have read a totally rational argument for a religious or spiritual concept that is so clear and simple.<br />It is not enough for Christians to say to the world: I believe in God, therefore I understand or serve Him - though that is also a fact, but not a rational one. If you wish to get on top of the human or rational arguments - this is it.<br />If you read the works of Thomas Aquinas, you will not find one rational argument that is unbiassed, so that his own last words had to be that all his writings were just such a load of trash in the face of the glory he has seen. Just by looking at his lifelong and fruitless efforts to bring together the false teachings of Aristotle and the true teachings of the Bible, already ensures us that he was a dumb ox - the words used by his tutor.<br />With GKC, this cannot ever be so.<br />I am not a Roman Catholic - the route he took when he became a Christian, but his arguments on orthodoxy are potent.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I have to admit that this game is good it gets boring at first but when you work your way up it becomes fun I give it 5 stars

B007HC3LHS|5.0|I was instantly hooked.  I finished the book in 3 days.  It took me a few chapters to get used to the back and forth between future and present but once I was adjusted the book flowed seemlessly
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Very Creative Movie. Genius. Great movie for those with an old soul. Witty and Hilarious. Owen Wilson plays and grerat character we can all relate to in ways.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I can't even explain how much I love this movie. I forget where I heard that this is the Breakfast Club of our generation but I can't help but agree.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|So well written.  These characters spring to life before my eyes.  I feel so intimately connected with their lives, with their processes.  It was a privilege to read this book.
B00006EXL5|5.0|Great album! so glad i got my hands on a copy &#60;3 now i have all of their albums!!!! LOVE IT!!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another great story from DeMille. Can't get enough of Corey. Looking forward to the next cat hunt!  Hopefully coming soon.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|THE is one of my favourites!I would say this should be for 1st grade and up;this actually my second favourite book;So buy this book.  Thank you Kinny!
B0090P98Z4|1.0|I am giving this game 1 star because, in 2013, there is no female character.  I find that just astonishing.  Not all of us gamers are male, and those of us who are not don't necessarily want to play a male character all the time.  There can certainly be fun to be had in taking on a completely different persona, but not if you are forced into it.<br /><br />I deleted this game after discovering that my beloved Rogue was nowhere to be seen.  Shame on you, Glu.  If you decide to add a female back in, I'll give your game another look.  In the mean time, I'm going to find a game that actually acknowledges the existence of women in the world.
B004J0PUP2|4.0|Perfect period movie. Great sets, acting and costumes. I enjoyed watching it this time as much or more than when I first saw it. Sad, but fascinating.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun I could play it all the time I asked my mom if I could get it on here phone
B007JNR4XW|5.0|It's nice to see Tatum Channing in his youth. He is a natural. It's also nice to see him with his future wife.
B002VHI8J0|3.0|Had problems getting my head around the plot.  Enjoyed some bits, especially the earlier episodes but was a bit lost on the futuristic stiff.  Took my poor husband to see the movie - if you haven't read the book, I don't think you'll ever get the movie.  Will appeal to some readers - not to me.  However, I loved The 1000 Autumns of Jakob de Zoet.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|I love this cd , become one of my favorites, really love zaz, she has a great voice and the lyrics are awesome.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Intersting perspective on time and how we pay too much attention to it. Quick read, only takes a few hours. A bit religious as god is the teacher/punisher.
B00975L81Y|5.0|THIS IS AN AMAZING RECORD, IS MORE TRASHY THAN USUAL BUT IS PUNKY AND CATCHY WITH MORE SING ALONG SONGS
B00280LYIC|5.0|Anything dealing with Greek and Roman mythology is generally pretty cool. My students in 4th grade are INFATUATED with the myths and they loved this book!
B001AII4RM|5.0|I thought this was the best movie I saw all year when it was released theatrically.  Of course, I also thought Babe and The Incredibles were the best movies of their years, so it shows where I'm coming from.  The most amazing part of this movie is not the animation, which is great, but the screenplay, which manages to broaden the original Beowulf tale without adding a lot of battles and even uses the correct names of the characters.  Highly recommended!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My older eyes find calculator easy to use.  I like the steps shown as you input.  Did square roots just like the desk calculator.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Awesome this is the most fun Game ever its really addicting and the Dragons are cute when you first get them
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Massive world-building in the Tolkien style. Solid characters facing real problems. Not a quest-style story; rather, it asks the question we all have to face: &#34;Who do I choose to be?&#34;<br />Alternatively, The Way Of Kings could be described as a case study in leadership and following.<br />Like any superb book, it leaves me hungering for more. Much, much more.
0670024813|4.0|The book is \\"The World until Yesterday\\"  and the author is Jared Diamond. This book was released in 2012, but picks up on several of the topics originally introduced in Professor Diamond's 1992 book, \\" The Third Chimpanzee\\".  For example, the evolution of language, religion, and human violence are all topics addressed in both books. However, the central theme of  \\"The World until Yesterday\\"  is much narrower.  It is concerned with what modern humans can learn from traditional societies. The author uses the term \\"traditional\\" rather than \\"primitive\\" when referring to those people existing still today that live in a clan or tribal society.<br /><br />Most of the content in this 466 page book is based on the author's personal experiences. He has spent a great deal of time in the heart of New Guinea, where traditional societies abound. Admittedly, I knew next to nothing about New Guinea before reading this book and what I have learned as a result of the book is an eye-opener. Hundreds of isolated clans, each with their own language, have existed unknown to the rest of the world until recently. If you had been born there, you would be fearful of straying outside of your clan's boundaries. You very well might be killed by the neighboring clan for trespassing. You would be concerned about finding food each day and sweet potatoes would be your main diet. However, you would be lean, muscular and healthy. Diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases would be unknown to you. You would be more socially involved than those in modern society.<br /><br />The author draws a lot from his New Guinea experiences, but  the book is also concerned with traditional societies globally. He also draws on his decades of field work in the Pacific Islands as well as evidence from traditional societies in Alaska, South America, and Africa. He illustrates that living in small groups and needing to survive day-to -day results in some common practices, which are very different from those of our modern industrial societies. For example, infanticide was a necessity if you couldn't feed another hungry mouth. Yes, it is unthinkable and even deemed to be murder in our modern societies. Yet the practice was common in previous times and still occurs in rare parts of the world  today. Cooperation and interdependence of clan members is another trait of traditional societies.<br /><br />The book could well be thought of as a textbook of social anthropology. It very thoroughly compares nearly all facets of traditional versus modern life. However, it is not as dry as a textbook due to the extensive personal experiences of the author, who I believe is in his mid-seventies. Moreover, he has an incredible mental grasp of the big picture, combined with an ability to simplify complex and controversial  topics.<br /><br />I personally found the book useful because I had been curious about primitive social man. I have read a lot of history of the last three centuries and a lot of reading on early man, but I was missing the intervening periods. I had surmised that primitive man was stronger, tougher, more superstitious, and more violent than modern man. Yet, Professor Diamond's new book methodically filled in for me much of what I didn't know about traditional living.<br /><br />Ralph D. Hermansen,  April 14, 2013industrial societies.

B0091REZMW|4.0|having fun looking for hidden items. so far it seems to move along. still working through itbutfound the tutorial essential to learning the game.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Best King book I've read in ages...and I've read most of them. My friends agree...it's a VERY hard act to follow, and Stephen King at his best!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Lots of fun had with this app. It is like a twist on bejeweled and an overall brain teaser. Definitely recommend
B0070Y46UY|5.0|One of the absolutely best &#34;fantasy&#34; books I've read since the &#34;Lyra&#34; series...even possibly better. Every feline critter in my ceramic menagerie has been re-named Richard Parker, for reasons I will not disclose due to the &#34;spoiler&#34; factor.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Once again, another album from a great artist.  His albums appear to be well crafted, and not hurried into production for deadline purposes.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I've seen the stage musical version many times, so I was familiar with all the songs. What I was not prepared for was the emotional impact of this movie. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were perfect. I highly recommend this excellent movie.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I got this for my grandsons and they enjoyed playing it! It did not take them long to figure out the sequence codes!
B00062IDCO|5.0|The season as a whole was great. But the finale was something of a disappointment. However, if anybody was following the show, it was a perfect jump off point for the post-series books that followed. Not quite the dramatic punch of the end of DS9, and in some ways reminiscent of the end of TNG, but all in all, worth the five stars.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I also got this game for my grandsons, they are 4 and 5. Took them a bit to figure it out, but they are getting it! They love to play!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Good portrayal of the UBL raid, with a bit too much profanity and torture in the first part of the movie.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This was for the grandsons and they enjoyed playing it! It was fairly easy for them to figure this out!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Very good portrayal of Lincoln, and his work on the Emancipation Proclamation.<br />Now, all we need is to hear Lincoln's voice on that missing phono-audiograph from 1863!
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Sometimes we get lost in the hustle and bustle of life. This book resets me every time. The laws are easy to apply to life and has definitely changed my outlook on life. I had a super stressful job once upon a time so I downloaded the audio book to listen to on the way to work to get my mind right.
B007PYEY9M|5.0|We watched this right before Easter and it will now be a yearly tradition.  Such a cute movie and so sweet!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I'm enjoying this game; I've heard so many great things about it, so It's awesome to finally be able to play it! :D
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|I love the doll.  I have many different Barbie dolls from different movies.  She is beautiful.  I am saving her for my granddaughters.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Glad we purchased this DVD!  Good movie (not what I had expected), much better actually.  A++++++  Thank you so much
B00020X88O|5.0|So a little over a year ago my husband and I went through a huge fire, where we lost just about everything we had, and the living room was completely gone. . .until we started digging through the rubble and Surprise! There was the box set just sitting there; no sign of the fire but the lingering smell on the large box, which I thew away.  I have no idea how that happened, or why of all things that made it through the fire, it had to be this. So we not only live on, we live on to be able to watch the magic of Showgirls and play with our deck of cards, and have drinking games, and have shots from our shot glasses. The fact that this survived has become a huge joke to us, and the last time I was in Vegas I made a special trip to have a drink at \\"The Peppermill\\", where showgirls filmed at, just to say thanks. =)
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|It always depends on your personal interests in movies...but I personally loved this movie...very enjoyable.  The DVD itself was brand new, no damage.  A++++++  Thanks!
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|This CD is an import and has terrific sound quality. The theme is not available on the soundtrack CD to Skyfall. If you want the<br />full score it is nescessary to purchase both the Thomas Newman soundtrack CD and the separate Adele theme CD. They are<br />worth it.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I liked the premise of this movie.  Didn't read the book so can't compare it to that, but it was better than I expected.  I don't know what all the hoopla is about Jennifer Lawrence, though.  Her acting is pretty average to me.
B0000542DJ|5.0|This movie was really good.  Lots of good acting and it gets you to question the events surrounding JFK's assassination.  I think everyone should watch it at least once!
B001QJUX24|5.0|Perhaps the best American Western ever made.  John Wayne is at his best, commanding the screen with every movement.  The scenery is best supporting actor.
B005USZML4|4.0|In &#34;The Abduction&#34;  Grisham produces a work that is of interest to adults and youth alike. Although a bit &#34;far fetched&#34; in spots (what the heck, it IS fiction , after all)  the book overall is interesting and fun.
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|Where can I begin with this review, other than how I wished the 5th season had been spectacular? Sadly, though, I felt it was far from it and was constantly reminded of how writers take the easy road in shows instead of choosing risky plots. Merlin: The Complete Fifth Season ought to have been a season of triumph, were Arthur defeats Morgana and reigns with his queen, Merlin can live as a wizard and adviser to the king, and Mordred can assume role as either ally or villain. Sadly, what I got was a season with three primary plot lines that repeated over and over and a very poor ending.<br /><br />The truth is that what started out as clever and unique show quickly devolved into a drag, with boring and superfluous plots and characters. Sometime around season 3 I began to realize this, then felt more hopeful when season 4 was more concise and interesting. Sadly, season 5's main plots include either: a. someone being kidnapped by Morgana, b. a spy in Camelot who is sent by Morgana, or c. Morgana attempts to take over the castle and fails yet again. This theme was repeated over and over until I thought I had serious deja vu, the only unique aspect to this season was the introduction of an adult Mordred who lingered between being good and becoming evil (much like a guy named Anakin who became Darth Vader, who then decided in about five minutes and if you blinked you missed it). That was it. There was no time for Merlin to actually be a wizard adviser to Arthur, there was no time to enjoy the defeat of Morgana, it was all crammed into the last episode. And I had assumed Arthur would be different from his old arrogant 1st and 2nd season self and actually value Merlin for all that he had done for him and with him in season 4. But like with everything else, the writers couldn't be bothered to mature the king and instead went with the old abusive servant gagline stand-by.<br /><br />While I will always love the character of Merlin, this season was a large disappointment, though not an unexpected one. I am relieved that the show is over, so perhaps Colin Morgan can find something with more substance for his acting career. He deserves it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Good insight into head trauma victims.  Interesting story with an unexpected twist. Loved the main character.I would recommend this story to anyone.
B009K86D86|5.0|Thought provoking and deeply troubling. You will never think about food the same.  It is very educational and must see.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut really pokes fun at organized religion, government, and science in this book.  The title refers to the child's string game, Cat's Cradle. When your fingers form the design, you see neither a cat nor a cradle. On the island of San Lorenzo, the state religion of Bokononism is based on lies and is outlawed to make life more interesting for its citizens . Science is based on fantasy and government does not govern. The journalist narrator Jonah joins the family of Felix Hoenikker, the father of the atom bomb, in San Lorenzo; where he meets \\"Papa\\" Monzano, the island's ailing dictator, and his adopted daughter, Mona Aamos Monzano. Jonah falls immediately, desperately in love with Mona. Before he died, Felix Hoenikker left a container of \\"Ice 9\\" in their summer cottage where his children discovered it. They divided the substance among them and kept this potent material in a thermos, hidden from the world, that is, until they get to San Lorenzo.<br /><br />Cat's Cradle is a rather short, but dense novel that one would have to read again and again to absorb all the little nuances that Vonnegut describes. Much has been written about the book and it has inspired references in music and literature. I will definitely place Slaughterhouse 5 on my future reading list.
1878424319|5.0|My husband took the book away from me, and now it is in his car and he is reading it. So I downloaded the audible book from Audible. com. I highly recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is the best series I have seen on television in many years.  The story and actors are great.  Hope to see many more seasons of this show in the future.
0316010669|5.0|Makes you think!!!!!!!!!  We all need to be more observant of our surroundings, so we can make better judgements about our aquaintances.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I saw the movie at the theatre; tough subject matter but great life lessons to learn from viewing. Wonderful acting by Denzel Washington; Riveting scene of aircraft flying upside down by Washington. As always in Amazon, great value, prompt shipping and loyal customers!
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was ok for what it is. I know it came from a book to which many people rave about, I guess the actors playing the role needs more conviction.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Excellent Movie, Terrific Story, Love having the 3 Disc Set, including thr Blu Ray 3D version and Digital Copy. Great Seller, Prompt Shipper, Super Value!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The only bad thing about reading this book is how tired I was after staying up all night to finish it!!  My first book by Kathleen Grissom but certainly not my last!
B004TTHLBE|3.0|That is all I can say. It was well written and very vivid. Gaiman has some interesting ideas on Gods.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|In this continuation of the television series &#34;Firefly,&#34; a group of rebels travels the outskirts of space aboard their ship, Serenity, outside the reach of the Alliance, a sinister regime that controls most of the universe. After the crew takes in Simon and his psychic sister, River, whom he has just rescued from Alliance forces, they find themselves being pursued by the Operative, an Alliance agent who will stop at nothing to find them.<br /><br />The movie is every bit as good as the TV series &#34;Firefly.&#34;<br /><br />For you SciFi fans, this is a must own movie. Get the TV series as well.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My best friend had bought my daughter this book when she was born and it has been missing but we found it on here so happy cutest book ever! Thank you
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book can`t wait to read the rest. It is heartracing, heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I enjoyed seeing how the Darcy and Ethan story played out. I'm glad it didn't have everyone being extra cheesy close at the end very realistic. A little predictable but I loved it!!
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Great film but only one of the extras is available on the DVD version, all other special features are exclusively on the BluRay. Very annoying.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson was chosen by Robert Jordan to finish the WOT series.  I figured that if RJ liked him enough to carry his legacy, then I should give him a shot. I was not disappointed.  Sanderson created a world so intricate and unlike any that I have ever read before. His characters were so deep in their motivations. Like my title says, I haven't read a book this good for years.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|First off... KEVIN BACON.<br /><br />Okay, now that's out of the way:<br />-Creatively imagined antagonist<br />-Lots of 'jump' scenes (make you jump)<br />-Clever plot, takes a minute to solve (but I figured out their ending before the movie ended<br />-Good dark horror flick<br />-MULTIPLE GRAINY SNUFF FILMS throughout the video (grisly, cringing, gory deaths)<br /><br />But....<br />-some stupid characters (hence the ending... which sucked)<br />-not the strongest plot ever (I figured it out before they delivered it)<br />-kind of lulls in some spots (slow plot progression)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game for all ages and close to actually owning a horse! Love the graphics and challenges! Much better than other farm games
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|-Fast Enough Plot, no lulls<br />-Great Comedy and comedic release during sad parts<br />-Good for adults and kids<br />-Good plot, not easily predictable<br />-Great Voice Acting<br />-Clever plot twists and great imagination obviously went into creating this<br /><br />Great movie, glad we watched it.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I thought overall it was a pretty good movie.<br />Worth watching if you like sex and violence.<br />I would recommend!
B00200K2UG|5.0|This bag is large and carries all of my camera equipment.  With some creative positioning of the pads this case could easily carry four (4) DSLR cameras. The dividers in the bag are padded strips with Velcro attachments. Most professional camera bags of this size cost $400 - $700, not in my price range.  And after reviewing the professional line of bags in the $400-$500 range most of them were constructed in the same fashion as this bag. Best option, unless you want to go PRO.
0316113506|4.0|Interesting read, challenging at the beginning with all of the physiology, yet intriguing and thought provoking.  Interesting enough to consider implementation.
1476733953|5.0|WOOL!  Think unique, non stop engaging story, intriguing characters, sexy techno/mechanics, late night reads, nail biting suspense then multiply by 10; the best part.. a little spoiler... IT IS THE BADGUY!  Brilliant!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is so awesome love the different places skate on dude love all the characters so many different things to upgrade your person
B0058W74UY|2.0|Can't play my videos, gonna have to uninstall. Wish I would've known before downloading. Will read reviews next time first.
B0065CCM76|4.0|Such a great collection of Bob Segers' biggest hits. I would recommend it to all my friends & anyone who loves timeless classics. Love it!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Flynn is a good writer. ' Objects and Places are good but not as good as Gone Girl. Good reads. Based on Gone Girl she will be tops in suspense writing.
B0098460O4|5.0|This is not my style of music. I only ordered it  on impluse after seeing these teenagers on You Tube and was then concerned I would regret it. Was I wrong. Although \\"The Prayer\\" and \\"Ava Maria\\"are givens, to my suprise my favorite tracks were #5 \\" Forse\\" and #6 \\" Il Mondo E Nostro.\\" Do not understand a word sung, but it doesn't matter. The voices of these two young people is so beautiful. They are wonderful together. It is now one of my favorite CDs.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a habit forming show with great scripts. The actors are terrific.  As busy as I am, this is definitely worth the time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Starts very slow,  once you get to the games etc... it is hard to put down.  Will be reading the others
B004UPALT6|3.0|I think at the end of the day army of darkness is the reason this movie is popular.  Ash is a great actor, but really it doesn't come together in this movie.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I read this about 12 times over the years.  I really recommend this book, it is amazing.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I don't know what some of you are talking about.  I have serious concerns about what you consider good, or scary movies if you think this was a terrible movie.  It was awesome!  As someone who watches every new horror movie that comes out, and who almost never gets scared watching them, I have to say this movie scared the life out of me!  I thought the story was AWESOME!  Loved Ethan Hawke!  This is definitely a movie you need to see if you like horror! DO NOT listen to the people who say this was terrible, dumb, or a waste of time.  They clearly wouldn't know a good horror movie if it bit them.  To those of you who thought it was bad, I suppose you liked the originial Evil Dead too.  Now that is a pathetic, horrible movie.  For those of you who want to see an awesome, scary, on the edge of your seat movie-Sinister is the movie for you.  Great acting, great story, overall-great, great, great!!!!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie because it was great life story, and it showed Denzel in a different type of character role. It shows the wide range of his talent and ability to bring different characters too life.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|My little boy absolutely loved it and he was able to put it together without any issues which is great.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
B003TJMY0S|5.0|Great movie, it brought to light some trues about the Irag war. It also lots of action, which i love, and there was plenty of suspense and intrigue.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I have really enjoyed the movie, but it has been a joke to try and download the digital copy to my Kindle Fire.
B00BF11STU|5.0|True stories are so much more interesting than most fictional stories.  The cast and script were both excellent.  We will watch this movie again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its great game and if you dont have this downloaded oj your device you are missing out on a great game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed one at work the other night and didn't have one. Saw this app and it works great. Keeps me from having to add one to my pruse.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|The movie is focused on people who are constantly rude to each other.  I didn't enjoy watching it.  I do not recommend the movie.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|This is a must see movie, especially the part when she's running the the hallway in the hospital. I'm in the movie.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|An excellent game full of creativity. It figures that it would take Rovio to come up with something as simple and delightful as the system for building the contraptions required to get you to the finish line. Lots of fun and a great deal for free. How could anyone complain? This is one I'll be playing again and again.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Good movie, great acting, great storytelling. I have no complaints at all with what Peter Jackson has done with The Hobbit.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I'm so sad that the book is done.  Michael Connelly hasn't lost the Harry Bosch magic.  Wish I had another one to read now.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I GAVE THIS CD 5 STARS!!!  I JUST LOVE HER MUSIC!!!  IF SHE HAD ANOTHER CD OUT I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY IT!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great plots.  Great actors. Great cinematography.  I couldn't stop watching; it was so exciting, wondering what would happen next.  You love Watson and  you love Sherlock, (even though you don't understand why.)
0545265355|5.0|What's there to say except these books are amazing! Borrowed the set from a friend and loved it so much bought my own. I love them so much no one and I mean no one except myself is allowed to read them. Some people just don't know how to treat books!!<br /><br />All 3 books are amazing although Hunger Games is definitely my favorite. A political uprising story that places you in the eyes of the up risers, feeling and sympathizing for them, and hoping only for the best for every single character. Teaching the value of strength and morals and knowing that despite the Capitol trying to keep them down, people are trying and will always be fighting for their freedom.
1616960922|3.0|Shai is caught replicating the Moon scepter.  She now faces a choice: be put to death for practicing illegal forging, or to forge a new soul for the Emperor.  To survive, Shai must do the impossible.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  It's well written and Shai is a great character.  The one problem I had was, I just wanted more.  It's like getting a taste of an interesting story, but only have access to one of the chapters.  You just felt like there was a bigger novel in there and I for one wanted to live longer in Shai's head.<br /><br />I would recommend this book, as the story is really fun and its a very interesting world.  But, be prepared to have it end with you wishing for more.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|My wife and I sat down to watch this last night with some reasonable expectations, but it turned out to be hard to follow and just didn't make a whole lot of sense. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but it just wasn't what all the other reviews made it out to be.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It is very user friendly. Easy to buy and sell your items right from the app. i would recommend it.
B001O96JC4|5.0|This is the classic early vampire film.  It is an unauthorized version of Bram Stoker's Dracula, which means it has a number of scenes from the book but misses some of the best book scenes and adds some interpretations.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game has much to offer with fighting monsters and lots of upgrading options for equipment. If you do not mind lots of repeat dungeons to get the coins needed this game will be fun with battles like Diablo.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|this receiver is great, it will work in the basement of my house with Streets and Trips 2013 unlike the one that came with streets and trips. the microsoft one i have to be outside and in clear sky!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This is a great book to read instead of doing yardwork, I suppose. It was strangley similar to the plot of \\"The Lucky One\\" in that they shared the unassuming good guy, the wisened old woman, the longsuffering female, and a bully ex-whatever, some life-threatening event, etc. I already read that book, and felt like I read it again with subtle changes. I will certainly consider reading another by Sparks because it is quite relaxing, but would like a more original plot.
044024238X|3.0|I'm quite a fan of Sophie Kinsella books. Not the Shopaholic series, though, but most of the others have been a very entertaining read for me. Her stories are full of twists and turns, characters are funny and witty and always manage to do the right thing at the end. This one, however, was very hard for me to digest.<br /><br />I give her 3 stars, because the first half of the book is a fast, tense read, but the other half is a complete frustration. In the first part of the story, Samantha is introduced as a workaholic. Soon she discovers she made a mistake and is put on the verge of her nerves. To avoid being subjected to the enormous pressure of guilt she wants to get as far as possible from her office. So, ok, I get that. I can even relate to running away to unknown. The events of that day are also quite plausible. She is in shock and she does not care if she made an error in judgment. I like how her past and present life intertwine and how she is dealing with all the conflicting thoughts. She meets a really hot gardener and I have to say I got butterflies when I read about the moment she realizes she has a total teenage crush on him.<br /><br />However, soon the story gets totally silly. I mean, I understand how it is when situation surprises you and you are left with your mind blank. I also understand how it feels when you cannot tell the truth, but you desperately want to. I can relate to the feelings of utter frustration building up inside you. But for god's sake! you cannot tell me that a highly trained lawyer of 7 years would not be able to address her situation throughout the whole book. She constantly fights with words and never finds the right moment to speak. Hell-ooo? I just could not buy that. I mean, to spend so many words and so much plotting around the fact that she is a top aspiring lawyer and equip her with such a low self-esteem, that just cannot be. Also, when she discovers she has been set up, she acts like a headless chicken. She approaches situation without a solid plan, without an A, B or C backup-plan. And she is supposed to be a lawyer? Her thinking is not even close to organized and the fact that she had a messy desk does not justify it. Her decisions at the end are again so frustrating, because she just cannot decide if she wants to live a fake life or not. She changes her mind several times and I have to say that by the end I've lost interest in her reasoning. I just didn't care, because I lost all the respect toward her.<br /><br />Sorry, Sophie, that was a bummer from your side.
B007R21JJK|5.0|I have built about 8 computers over the last 5 years and have always used Gigabyte boards.  I find that they are easy to configure out of the box and often have advanced features.  In this case, I was building a computer for under $1000 total and this was the right board for an Intel I5 processor.  Posted and worked the first time.  One of the things I like is that it supports more video output modes than most - HDMI and Displayport in addition to VGA.  And it supports eSata and USB 3.0.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|IT's an awesome book . You will really enjoy it.Just make sure you understand it. When your done with it make sure you read Catching Fire and Mocking Jay. If you want  to learn more about this book go to [...] . I totally recommend it. Happy reading!!!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I'm not sure whether this is meant to be a novel for adults or a necessarily shorter book for young adults;it hovers between the two, charming but occasionally frustrating. The end seemed like a beginning, leaving me a bit in satisfied.<br /><br />The photographs are entrancing. Maybe I've missed the point and the story is a series of long cations. I found the ebook perfect for enlarging and visiting with the photos.<br /><br />Not sure why I'm not in love with this book; perhaps because I'm not peculiar enough.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This game used to be great but after a recent update it doesn't load right.  It crashes all the time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love how the author makes you feel as you read this book. I could feel hunger and stress and love/lust. I felt sick when made difficult decisions. It was written very well yet easy to read. I grew attached to all the characters and found myself loathing the capital just as Catniss does.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Had a hard time getting into it. but once I did I could not put the book down loved it!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey, is a writer with a true talent for characterization.  You get these people, you root for them and you cry for them. His storyline is focused and the concept keeps your interest. You won't be disappointed with this exciting writer.
B000FA675C|5.0|My only dislike is that the book isn't longer.  Still a fun book to read while traveling away from home, perhaps to Paris, France.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|My belief that there is life beyond our earthly existence are once again affirmed by this learned medical physician and what he experienced while in a coma. I found it reassuring to learn of what his heavenly journey entailed.  Both the positive and negative aspects of this book deal with the scientific medical explanations that were sometimes tedious and hard to follow.  Positive because they reinforced my religious belief of life after death and my desire to read the entire book so as not to miss anything but detailed medical explanations meant to affirm his experience from a scientific standpoint spoiled some of my enthusiasm for the story.  If you yearn for another experience affirming life after death, then you will enjoy this story.
1449410243|1.0|A student requested this book for our grade-school library, but I can't put it on the shelf. It had something on nearly every page I read that I couldn't feel good about putting in front of kids. I can see that people who like cats might enjoy the humor of it, but I guess I should have researched The Oatmeal more before I purchased the book. Not for young readers or others who are sensitive to crassness.

B0077EBWVI|4.0|This film updates some music to today's &#34;standards&#34; and makes it a little more applicable with today's situations that adolescents face today.  Hopefully many can watch and learn from this film on proper respect both ways as well as respecting yourself
B0089LOKHG|4.0|But I got sucked into in and found myself looking forward to each subsequent book and not being disappointed. Thanks
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this game is so cool and tricky its. very cool I love how you have to go back and do things
B0015AARJI|1.0|&#34;Item arrived on time, but description was deceptive. This is not an official controller and besides being and looking cheap is slow and responds poorly. This last point is key- you won't be able to play first person shooter games and others that require a quick response from button inputs and smoothness in the analog sticks. Stay away, this is a useless controller.&#34;

1250012570|5.0|Set in 1986, Eleanor and Park is the story of two awkward teens named Eleanor and Park (go figure!) who fall \\"in love\\" while riding next to each other on the school bus and sharing their love of comic books and music.<br /><br />This is just the sweetest love story. So adorable and charming! It's not all bright and sunny, and there are some serious issues faced by these characters. But most of the time I couldn't help but just sigh with happiness as I read about how Eleanor and Park fell in love.<br /><br />I loved the switching points of view between Eleanor and Park. I thought it worked splendidly for this novel. I especially liked when they switched back and forth within the same conversation or with just a few sentences from each character at a time. It was a clever way of telling the story that worked really well in my opinion.<br /><br />I also loved that this book was different than most teen romance books out there. It still had plenty of romance (i.e. cheesy, mushy, over the top declarations of love for each other). But the relationship between Eleanor and Park was also awkward and insecure and real. Both Eleanor and Park (though Eleanor more so than Park) were considered misfits who were unattractive in some way and didn't fit in with the majority of their peers. They weren't beautiful or perfect, but they were real. And I loved that about them.<br /><br />I've seen several reviews complaining about the lack of resolution with the ending. I get where those people are coming from, as the story could have ended with more closure. Often that can drive me crazy about a book. But in the case of Eleanor and Park, I really liked the ending. I felt that the story was resolved enough to satisfy me, but still open enough to engage my imagination in what the future might hold for Eleanor and Park.<br /><br />I seriously loved this adorable book! I'm going to have to check out Rainbow Rowell's other books now!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|It is nice to see that Boz hasn't lost a thing.  What a great album.  Hopefully he will not wait as long as he did between this album and his last to release another one.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Got As FAOTD.  Fun game...Have to match Tiles In Sets Of Three Or More.  The Quicker You Match Them, The More Stars You Get.  Am Currently Stuck In Day 35 In India. Not Sure If I'm Supposed To Purchase More Levels Or If There's A 'Glitch.  Overall, It's Challenging.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Discovered Joe while flipping channels and he was on our local PBS station with his Royal Albert Hall concert.  Was amazed and have been a fan ever since.  This was a nice change to hear some of my favourites done ascoutically.  Every time I play it, I discover some thing new.  Can not wait for his next album.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|I bought this movie after only seeing it once and I am happy with my decision.<br /><br />Reasons why I found this movie to be so great are:<br />● The creative, artistic way the movie has been put together<br />● My sweet spot for Zooey Deschanel's smile<br />● The movie's choppy sequencing kept the story fresh<br />● Geoffrey Arend who had me laughing at almost every moment he was on screen (this guy needs to be in more roles!)<br />● And lastly, the inspiring \\"for every negative there is a positive\\" ideal at the heart of the movie<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good Rom-Com.
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|Did not know anything about it so I watch it and loved it. Good acting and story. I do recommend.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|Great music and very easy to listen to and since I had never heard of this group before it was all new to me.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I reAlly enjoyed this book.  It wa well written and  it kept you interest.  I plan on reading the other books he wrote.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Really easy to use, and very portable. Delivers quality sound to my V-Moda headphones and the battery life has been stellar so far. Going on 9 hours currently.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I am dying of cancer (lung) and so looked forward to reading this book, but for a layman I found it far too detailed for me and also when I ordered the book it was because I saw Eben A. on TV and thought it would take some of my fear away.  But, found you really spent very little time on the issue and more time on explaining all the medical jargan and how your family reacted.  My family is fantastic too, but was disappointed in your book.  I envy your wonderful experience tho!  Thanks Mary
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I think it's fun but my three year old cousin can't play unsupervised because you have to pay real money
B007Y36K46|4.0|This weekend we were getting Encore and Starz for free on Direct TV. I took that opportunity to watch 'John Carter'.  I had not heard or read many good reviews about the film so I was in no rush to see it.  Now that I have seen it I can honestly say it was one of the best new sci-fi films I've seen in ages.  The story was almost epic. It had pretty much everything, even a very satisfying love story and the type of ending I hope for in a film.  I really don't understand all the criticisms I had heard about this movie.  I recommend it to all sci-fi fans and I hope they do a sequel...though this one was pretty good as a stand alone story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|SO GOOD I LOVE THIS BOOK IT IS GREAT I can't wait to read the other one and reread them again
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy playing this game and it is really fun.. but it is hard to level up and can be expensive if you choose to buy credits. Also a player cannot receive the free credits, coins, and keys offered through Blitz 's fan page on facebook if you do not have access to a computer.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed every page of this book.  The story kept my interest from beginning to end and took me through all the emotions of the characters.  I highly recommend this book.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Hold on a second there! This isn't a worthwhile thing, so you're probably better off not even getting it , because it is the worst piece of  published writing I have ever encountered.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|I loved the movie itself. It's entertaining, full of anticipation and unexpected.<br /><br />I started the movie full of hope to watch Pi generously, humbly, search for God and truth. It ended with the modern PC dogma that reduces God and truth to whatever I want to think. It kills the search for truth, because everything is truth. By killing the search for truth and reducing it down to whatever I want to interpret it as, suddenly there is no morality I must adhere to either.<br /><br />To all those people who voice frustration wondering what was the point of this movie and what was the truth of what happened... you're right on. That's the movie's message about all of life. All religion, science, and morality, comes down to whatever you want to interpret it to be. We all interpret things differently so that means we can all be right at the same time. That everyone can judge what happened to Pi for themselves is completely dissatisfying. We want to know truth, not to make it up.<br /><br />The father in the movie said that if you believe everything, you believe nothing. Searching for truth is satisfying. Making it up as you go is not.<br /><br />I recommend this book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1933919469 Absolute Relativism: The New Dictatorship and What to Do about It]]<br /><br />If I'm completely off in my interpretation of the message of this movie please correct me.<br /><br />.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My kids (daughter age 9 and son age 11) loved this book and couldn't put it down!  They are hooked on the series!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Excellent quality, easy to setup on xbox for the amazon app. Great to watch without commercials!!  Would recommend to others!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I've watched season 1 a couple of times and I love it. This is truly a unique show. As a audience we are left in the dark for many aspects of the show, but I truly enjoy going along for the journey and uncovering new parts of the show. Keeps you on your toes!
B00AFEY354|5.0|I loved to see the scenes with Kandas  and the one with his friend, it was awesome. Really worth my money.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters are brought yo life by great actors. Costumes are fabulous! Story lines keep you guessing and coming back for more!! I love it!!
0307346617|1.0|VERY boring, not at all what I was expecting. I am having an extremely hard time getting through it. I would not recommend.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is an excellent novel which I am re-reading for the fourth or fifth time. Goes well with Angels and Demons even though they are not really related..
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Up to Disney standards. Purchased for grandchild. My daughter wrote a paper on it. Look forward to continuation of this.
B004R10N6O|5.0|I like this movie because it makes me laugh. I don't laugh at a lot of things my husband watches. I chose this movie and had a few good laughs. It is always nice to see that I am not the only one that gets a hard time at my job. This movie shows some of us to be grateful for the type of endeavors we face at the workplace because it could be 10 times worse. And it is always funnier when it is someone else having to deal with the drama instead of u.
B00992CF6W|3.0|i use this app on my kindle fire, and it works fairly well. i personally get too bored with it to keep up with it for longer than a few minutes at a time. but it is a great way to waste time if you have some to waste.
B00168HARG|5.0|Hello I'm telling you the order arrived and everything is in perfect condition. I'll keep buying more stuff. They are of very good quality. 100% recommended.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|there arent enough words to describe how amazing this season is! and season 3 is shaping up to be just as good if not better. now if only GRRM would spend some time writing the conclusion of these stories, we'd all be better off.

1451627289|5.0|As a long time Stephen King fan I was very excited to read this book. He did not let me down. This novel is gripping, exciting, and filled with suspense and intrigue. It is a wonderful mix of fantasy and real historical facts. I was extremely impressed with the way that King masterfully wove his story around historical events. This is a must read for anyone interested in time travel and american history. It is not a horror story even though it does have a few &#34;monsters&#34; and you do not have to be a Stephen King fan to enjoy this novel. While there are a few references to some of his earlier work, thrown in for rabid fans, this story line is accessible to anyone. I am proud to add this to my library and will be recommending it to everyone.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|As a line cook myself (and one rather low on the totem pole) I found this book hilariously accurate. A good read for anyone in or out of the business
B0060MYK7G|5.0|This is one of my favorite new series.  I love the Tudors when it was airing on Showtime and when the Borgias was being previewed I just couldn't wait to start watching it.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book is sad but moving.  It is creatively written and leaves the reader with nail biting suspense. I recommend to young adults and older.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love this movie and its special editions.  It is a must have for any collector or a fan of the Hobbit and LOTR to own because it is one of the best movies that came out.  Peter Jackson done a tremendous great job making this movie, and of course can't wait for remaining two to come out.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Inspiring and, unbelievable this book will grab the attention of nearly any reader.  This book puts the reader in the unique situation of Pi himself and takes you along with great description and more.
B0055S348W|2.0|didn't provide an actual working app w/o add cost requested cancel @ this time until I get 2 no my Kindle more
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I liked the game and the graphics were really good.  Just wish it had lasted longer for the price.  All in all, a decent game.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book was a fresh breeze, a delightful break for the stress day-to-day craziness. Sophie is great, made me laugh my eyes out !
B005P3NPXG|5.0|I like that Seal does remakes of classic songs that happen to be favorites of mine.  I would recommend this if you love Seal.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great love story disguised of something else, nothing to be shock at! Very funny and amusing book. I loved the characters, both damaged in different levels. If the reader could go beneath the surface and drown itself on the mind of both Grey and Anna, the reader will find very delicate, intricate elaborated characters. And the hot stuff is so easy to read... entertaining I'd say !
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars has an incredible voice!  I like the eclectic style of songs that he has on this album.  I especially love &#34;Locked out of Heaven&#34; and &#34;Gorilla&#34;.  Bruno ROCKS!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great sequel for this so called controversy book, it was good to have a better perception of the twisted minds of both protagonists.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|My son had told me that he liked the other Lord of the Rings movie that we have so we decided to give this movie a go. It's hard to get a 12 year old to sit threw a regular 1 1/2hr movie so you can only imagine how hard it would be for a movie of this length. As the movie progressed he and I grew more fixated on the tv and didn't even want to take a break to make a snack. We hope they come out with more of these types of movies.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Interesting how the author &#34;finished&#34; a so controversy story, and I really enjoyed the last chapter, it was like an extra gift for her faithful readers!
B000KIPT30|2.0|You get what you pay for.  This is a cheap headphone amp for a cheap price.  There's a lot of noise but it will make your signal louder,.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This is a wonderful season, and it starts with a bang, as the Doctor has to save the world in 20 minutes! The Weeping Angles return (and how!), the Tellurians (from the original series) return, and there is the absolutely phenomenal episode with Vincent Van Gogh. The season ends with the Pandorica, a twisty tale that has the Doctor facing off against dozens of his enemies, as they attempt to save the universe from HIM. The escape from the Pandorica, followed by the numerous jumps to set up the final scenes are excellent. I didn't really care for the Victory of the Daleks or Vampires in Venice episodes, but maybe that's just me. All the rest were somewhere between very good and excellent.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I've only played this game a short time but I like that there are many different layouts.  I do find the tiles a little tricky to differentiate as the art is a bit bland.  Other similar games with more complex art are easier to see and, therefore, faster to play.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A little technical about the brain fonction but nice to read. A real good & true story that made a big change in his life & can change others.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This really had me involved in rooting for the main characters. Good job Mr. Howey, and thanks. I hope you continue with the story.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|What a classic CD! Many great songs! I have been a Def Leppard fan for decades. I am amazed at a one-armed drummer like Rick Allen. I especially like the [Deluxe Edition] versions. Amazing!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted I am so glad I could find it and cant wait for the next season! I wish I knew when It is coming out because I didn't want it to end!!
B000FDEUFS|5.0|I am right there with you brother Duane. We miss you. The Allman Brothers are probably my favorite band of all-time. I have seen them in concert more than 100 times since 1970. This [Deluxe Edition] was a must have for me.
B0088ZSKOC|5.0|I have Andrew Johnson's app on another device and it has helped me tremendously with my sleep difficulties. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has trouble sleeping or needs to relax.
B00007GZQI|5.0|Finally came out on DVD. I've been waiting to replace my old VHS tapes. It was great to watch it again with all the extras thar DVDs have.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|DVD was enjoyable...light with sporting another viewpoint from the &#34;bad guys&#34; side. Good story for kids and adults, all ages. Good memory jogger with historical games... Liked that story uses the environment well - tying characters, software, hardware equipment, and electrical and electronic components together without being corny. .
B0019M06JS|5.0|This CD always takes me back to a time and place in Rio. Nice and very relaxing mood changer for me.
1451695195|4.0|When you read Proof of Heaven, you will get excited about what is possible.  Here on Earth, how do we really know about God, heaven, etc?  We have our faith and our interpretation of events to guide us.  Proof of Heaven gives a fair amount of credibility to the idea that God, heaven, angles all exist.  And, the implications for our experience on Earth are that we take ourselves much too seriously, that we can actually enjoy life here and know that we can enjoy our existence after we die.  It certainly gave me the opportunity to reflect and think, and I hope the same for you.
B00005NB0H|5.0|This was a classic concert. I have the original album on 12&#34; vinyl. I like the [Deluxe Edition] even better. More music.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|4 hour plane flight made painless by this fun and simple game... Seems to work well for kids aged 7 thru 12...
B0000ADY9I|5.0|I have wore out so many vinyl albums I had to have backups on CD. I love these [Deluxe Editions]. Another must have for me.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|4 hour plane flight made painless by this fun and simple game... Seems to work well for kids aged 7 thru 12...
B00008LOS1|5.0|This is my favorite Who CD of all time. I already have the original on 24K gold. Had to have this one of the [Deluxe Edition] series. More versions and more music!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I chose to read The Language of Flowers because the title and book summary intrigued me. From the first few paragraphs I fell in love with this story. I have never read anything with this story line quite like it. It broke my heart to read of Victoria's life in the foster care and group homes. To think about an eighteen year old sleeping in the park. Throughout the rest of the book I kept rooting for her to find her place and overcome the residual feelings of unworthiness of love. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and would recommend The Language of Flowers to anyone who just loves a good story.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|I have the original album, but I love the extra tracks on these Deluxe CDs! I wish more CDs were issued in the Deluxe style.
0374214913|3.0|This book already had my vote when I first bought it. I mean let's face it: this is a book about books and the mysteries and secrets they may hold. If you are obsessed by books as much as I sometimes may be, you are bound to find something interesting in it.<br /><br />Although the story line, humanity's everlasting search for immortality, is nothing new, the simple fact that the characters, especially the \\"Average Joe\\" Clay Jannon, show some sort of self-deprecation brings humor to this complex story plot. By this process, the author shows that the story doesn't take itself too seriously bringing in some welcome lightness.<br /><br />As Robin Sloan allies all you normally need to make a good book (a good story plot full of twists and complexities with realistic characters), the author makes this important point: it is and will always be possible to have a balance in-between the Old and the New and this balance might forever coexist. His point is frequently repeated in this book as the characters will have to use both modern technology as well as old books to crack this 500 years old mystery. Throughout the book, he also makes a point of showing that both vectors have their advantages and limitations, reinforcing his point of view about the cohabitation of these two information mediums.<br /><br />And yet, as every person has its flaws so does every book, this one being no exception. The technical jargon about computer programming and the programming techniques described in this novel were a little complicated to understand and the concepts of their use difficult to grasp.<br /><br />Moreover, the fast paced story plot made it at times feel as if all this puzzle solving and mystery cracking was a tad bit too easy for the characters. The struggles they had didn't seem as convincing as they should have. This feeling is further reinforced through the too perfect ending; which is why the book ended up feeling a little flat to me, hence its rating.<br /><br />This beingsaid, even though this book doesn't end up being as memorable to me as I first thought it would be, it remains a good book that showcases an interesting point of view about the future and the preservation of the old and new knowledge.<br /><br />For more on this book and others, please come visit my blog at :<br /><br />ladybugandotherbookworms.blogspot.com
B005PK57IK|5.0|Excellent cast. Excellent plots and the flow is so believable. Thanks amazon prime for making this available. I completed all available seasons.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was way more than fantastic. I'm left wanting more. It is a true love story in the end.
B00129H7VS|5.0|After visiting Normandy and some of the sites of the 101st airborne I realized it was fairly histrionically accurate. There are a few mistakes and a few parts where they speed up the battles but other then that the people and stories are very accurate. The overall production is amazing. recommended to anyone that has a interest in war films or history, actually if you are reading this you will like it.
1423136802|5.0|I ordered this on a whim, but I am incredibly pleased with the product overall. It was in good shipping, not a scratch on the case, and it came quickly! I am glad that I ordered this, because it is perfect!
B00049QQHI|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite films.  Leonardo Dicaprio was so convincing in his acting.  The scene when he was at his mother's door I just broke down and cried.  The most touching movie I've seen in a long time.
037582913X|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. It is nice and big, perfect size for young ones. I remember being young as well as reading this to my cousins when I was a teenager. Properly read, this book is so funny! I have a new young one in my life and just had to have this book again. The Monster at the End of this Book is great!
B0098G67TU|5.0|Fabulous movie.  Well told, respectful story about the Titanic disaster told from the point of view of a fictional love affair.  There are a couple of racy scenes that aren't appropriate for younger viewers (a woman's bare body shown from behind and 1 bare breast is shown, and a couple making love in a car is shown from outside the car).  Also, the overall story of a ship sinking and over a thousand people drowning or freezing to death might be a bit much for the kiddies.  Fabulous cinematography, amazing effects of the sinking ship, lots of real facts woven in among the fictional story make this a very captivating movie.  Sad, but fabulous.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game is a waste of time and space on your memory and you instantaneously have to download a over 200mb d download so in my opinion waste of time and space do not download
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|Twelve levels are free, then you pay to unlock.<br /><br />This game locks up the keyboard. You only need the keyboard to enter a player name, but if you share this game with anyone this will give you trouble.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I have used other models of mp3 audio players, and this brand is by far the best. I would recommend spending a little more money for the better sound quality than the cheaper brands advertised.  I have used 2 models of Soundfly brand and they both work great.
1616550414|5.0|For the long time fan and the new comer both, you'll like what's in this book.<br />Unseen artwork and a chronology that explains how the story all works out.<br />Keep it safe on the shelf or display it proudly!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was very easy to read, with a great story line.  If you want a mini-escape from the day to day grind, this is your book.
0545123267|3.0|This book was okay but there are so many others out there these days that are along this same topic it doesn't compete with the larger novels.
0872860175|5.0|After having just reread Howl for the umpteenth time, it seems to get better.  The brilliance of the poetry stands out clearer to me now than ever before, perhaps because over time I've gotten more and more into poetry.  Every few words takes one's breath away in parts, yet the pace is such that one has to keep on reading.  Not for the traditionally oriented, yet excellent poetry nonehteless.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is a great game to play it is awesome and fun it is just great<br />A great game
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|she is so underrated. this girl should be way more popular than she is. she is absolutely amazing. beautiful singer. her voice is so unique. I could listen to her album time and time again. it absolutely baffles me why she is not more popular.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|This album is put together very well.  I love his stuff with The Frames and Swell Season.  This is just another great collection of his music.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I really love playing Jurassic Park. I showed my park to my son, and he liked it. He got the app on his phone and also for my grandson on his Kindle fire. I would recommend this game.
0307341577|3.0|Well drawn characters, but... The ending...too much confluence. Great book until the last 10 pages.  A Good summer beach book.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Another great story,designed to entrap you in the content and it does just that. A. Little.romance seems to help liven things up a bit. But then dosn,t it usually? I found it an enjoyable read. Wouldn't, have missed it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I've very much enjoyed this game. The first ten levels are nicely paced and I keep coming back often to check on my dinosaurs.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|Warning: This review may contain some spoilers<br /><br />Why do we choose to tell the stories that we tell in the way that we tell them? Is it to portray unembellished reality or do we chose our narrative in service to a deeper purpose? In the novel Life of Pi, Yann Martel suggests that stories are how we find meaning in the universe; they are a path to God. Martel's characters tell stories that provide comfort, explain hardship, and provide inspiration without being literally factual. The author takes pains to remind the reader that the book itself is a work of fiction and that the literal representation of the truth is not his priority. In fact, Martel seems to say that sometimes we must abandon literal truth if we want to find meaning in the universe. If we fail to look beyond the literal truth in search of something deeper, we will \\"lack imagination and miss the better story\\"--we may fail to find God (Martel, 2007, p. 64).<br /><br />Piscine Molitor Patel, known as Pi, is the titular character of the novel. The book's central conflict is Pi's struggle to survive while adrift at sea in a lifeboat after his ship sinks. He must endure against elemental forces, lack of food and fresh water, and stave off despair. However, on top of these very serious challenges, he must also deal with the fact that he is not alone in the life boat. For most of his ordeal, his only companion is a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker: a wild and untamed creature that could easily kill him at any time. However, this is not a simple survival story where the tension comes from wondering if the main character will manage to triumph over adversity. Even before we know a single detail of his ordeal, Martel assures us that Pi is alive and well, living an almost ordinary life. At the same time, he assures us that this is \\"a story to make you believe in God\\" (Martel, 2007, Author's Note). Much of the tension of the book comes in discovering what the author means by this.<br /><br />On the surface, this is a survival story. However, this is not really a book about Pi's ordeal at sea; it is about the telling of the story of Pi's ordeal at sea. In the course of the narrative, there are at least five different times that one character tells the story to another. We are only privy to the details of two of these exchanges; the others occur \\"off stage.\\" However, after each one, Martel shows us the impact hearing the tale has on the listeners. We get the sense that nobody is truly the same after hearing it. This is true even though the two versions of the story we see are mutually contradictory. By this, Martel demonstrates that it is not necessarily the literal truth of a tale that makes it meaningful. There is some other aspect of the story that makes it meaningful.<br /><br />In the Author's Note, Martel calls fiction \\"the selective transforming of reality\\" and says that writers create it \\"for the sake of greater truth\\" (Martel, 2007, Author's Note). This note is where the narrative actually starts; it is part of the fiction Martel has created, not something that lives apart from the rest of the book. The character of the author appears throughout the book in a series of interludes within Pi's narrative. Martel uses these recollections to describe the man Pi has become and how the events of the story have changed him. The author also uses them to heighten the mystery about what exactly transpired in the lifeboat. He makes numerous references to events that have not yet been shared with the reader, foreshadowing the action to come.<br /><br />Martel devotes most of the book to telling Pi's preferred account of his ordeal. This is a story that focuses on both the practical day-to-day details of his survival and his internal struggle to retain his faith in a higher power. The account is striking in both its realism and its utter implausibility. Even if we ignore the improbability of being able to survive on a lifeboat with an untamed Bengal tiger for 277 days, there are many other aspects of Pi's story that are hard to believe. We know this because Martel takes pains to have other characters, such as the shipping agents who hear the tale, point out the implausibility of these aspects. Details such as encountering another lifeboat at random in the Pacific midway through the journey, finding an almost magical floating island, and just the act of being able to survive in a lifeboat for 277 days are all highlighted as being hard to believe. However, this is not the only account of the events that Pi offers. He tells an alternative version of the events that is just as brutal and unforgiving as the other, but far more plausible. In this story, many more things make sense. Pi's actions are selfish, even if excusable. His thoughts are about survival, revenge, and satisfying his hunger, not his relationship with God. This version has only ugliness; it offers no meaning. Pi tells the shipping agents both of these stories and offers them a choice; the author does the same for the reader.<br /><br />Pi seems to prefer the version of the story where he finds meaning because that is something he craves. Earlier in his narrative, he describes how his search for meaning caused him to become a Christian, a Muslim, and a Hindu, all at the same time. Each of these religions tells stories that explain the universe; they provide meaning and comfort. Pi embraces all of them. He feels no need or obligation to choose between these mutually exclusive stories. Why should he choose? The author told us in the Author's Note that stories are selective transformations of reality for the sake of greater truth. Pi craves this truth; he wants to know God and not restrict himself to \\"dry, yeastless factuality\\" (Martel, 2007, p. 64).<br /><br />For the most part, both versions of Pi's narrative have the same elements; each of the fanciful aspects of the first narrative has a corresponding aspect in the second narrative that is tragically believable. However, there is a key part of the first narrative that does not appear in the second one: the floating island. This is the least plausible portion of Pi's first narrative. The island is an idyllic place (at least at first) with almost magical properties. It is wholly absent from the second narrative. This is a mystery within a mystery; the shipping company representatives he tells the story to give up trying to understand it. We are left to wonder if it points to a gap in Pi's second story, a piece that explains how a man could survive that long at sea. On the other hand, maybe it does not appear in the second story because it was literally true and needed no amendment. We are left to wonder.<br /><br />Martel is careful to leave the door open for both interpretations of the story. For instance, one of the shipping representatives calls the island a botanical impossibility (Martel, 2007, p.  294). However, the representatives had also just assured Pi that the floating island of bananas that appeared earlier in the story was similarly impossible, an assertion that Martel shows proven wrong (Martel, 2007, p. 293). In this way, Martel hints that if the representatives were mistaken about one floating island, they might be mistaken about another. If one thing that is hard to believe is possible, perhaps another incredible thing also can be so. Even when we are convinced we know what happened, Martel reminds us that we should have doubt. The author tells us how he has read the diary that Pi kept during his ordeal. In it, we are shown Pi questioning his relationship with God. This is the Pi of the first story, not the survival obsessed pragmatist of the second one. There is always reason to doubt.<br /><br />Why does Martel tell this story in the way that he does? Why is this not a simple linear narrative of a boy trapped on a lifeboat with a tiger? Martel tells the tale this way because he wants the reader to face the same choices that his characters face. He uses a complex structure of narratives within narratives in order to create ambiguity. The reader is left to decide what really happened. Do we choose the version of events with meaning, or the one with plausibility? Which one do we prefer? Is the \\"more plausible story\\" truly plausible? Martel refuses to give us definitive answers to these questions. Martel uses the plot and structure of the book to show that it does not matter if either is true. It does not matter if the author invented this story or if, as he says, it was told to him. What matters is the meaning we choose to give the story as readers.<br /><br />Work Cited<br /><br />Martel, Yann (2007). Life of Pi (Kindle Edition). New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

B0014H32MG|3.0|It's a rare case in which an only distantly related movie adaptation is actually more logical than the original book. Ben Richards signs on for a cross-country spree of violence which - while nothing seems wholly impossible, it's extremely unlikely that this level of carnage would be tolerated. By my last count, in this book - Richards kills ten police officers, commits felony arson and kidnapping, not to mention the destruction of all the cop cars. Even if he's the best at the game; there's just no way any government would tolerate the violence. Killian explains that the show is good for getting rid of agitators and troublemakers - but these troublemakers have plenty of chances to unleash terrifying destruction. Even the most callous and distant government would be unable to tolerate the rampant mayhem unleashed by these desperate men with nothing to lose. Surely, a few other contestants have done damage too - (even if it's not half as bad as what Richards achieves in the end) And then, next week, it just starts all over again? My suspension of disbelief won't let me to accept that any state would allow a repetition of this cycle of carnage.<br /><br />That said, the carnage was fun to read about. Good Prose, flawed premise.<br /><br />The movie, on the other hand - takes place in an enclosed setting, with no one involved but volunteers that agree to the risk. Much easier to belief than this orgy of mad violence. Still, very exciting. I might have given it 4 stars, but I expect more from such a big name as King.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've read the Hunger Games trilogy several times and it still holds my attention til the very last word on the very last page. Even knowing what's going to happen, I can't put the books down. Worth the read, recommend it to the others. It's not just sci-fi or romance but has undertones of so much more. Definitely a top favorite series for me.

B005LAII08|5.0|I love this movie. It's strong and has a good message. Yes, there are 2 small scenes with bare butts, but they're not randomly placed and they add to the movie as it 1) explains how the men got there and 2) wouldn't make sense if they had clothes at that point.  That and it breaks up a more serious movie with a bit of humor.  There's even an extra scene after the credits that's good and fits in with the story.<br /><br />And that leads me to my only complaint.  WHY was it necessary to list the marketing team, theme parks, and even the babies?  The credits are way too long. Who in the movie theater actually sat through them to see the little clip at the end?  Really?  Okay. Rant over. :)
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|This movie is very close to the book.  It does have some &#34;adaptations&#34; but in the main it is very close to Austen's work.  If you are a fan of Jane Austen, you will like this movie.

It did take them a bit to figure out how to get started but they both got!  I love knowing they'll have an edge in math class!

1439148953|4.0|\\"In the days that followed no mention was made of Father Flood's visit or his raising the possibility of her going to Brooklyn, and it was the silence itself that led Eilis to believe that Rose and her mother had discussed it and were in favour of it.  She had never considered going to America.\\"<br /><br />In the opening lines of the story, we have a young woman, Eilis Lacey, who is living in a  small Irish town in the years following World War II.  She lives with her mother and her older sister and she has been having trouble looking for work.  The tale that follows is a lovely coming-of-age story.  Prior to the war, the life of women was often mapped out, and young girls were taught to mind their parent's wishes.  Eilis' father has passed away, and now it is up to the rest of the family to support themselves.  Her brothers were already working in England, Rose has a job and is supporting her mother.  But what to do about Eilis?<br /><br />Over the course of the book. Eilis struggles between what others want for her and what she discovers she wants for herself.  It happens in a natural, subtle way, and I couldn't help but appreciate the author's keen insight into a woman's mind and circumstance.  There is something artful in it's simplicity.  This was a thoroughly enjoyable read!

In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it.  In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge.\\"<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is, in my opinion, probably the best of the mass-market fiction authors.  Her writing is smart and savvy, and she takes a subject that is part of modern American culture and she turns it on it's head.  Nineteen Minutes is a story about a school shooting.  The shooter, Peter Houghton, is an unpopular boy that has been picked on every day of his life.  Picoult not only manages to make the reader sympathize with a boy who murders ten people, but we also sympathize another character, Josie Cormier, current member of the popular crowd.  The reader sees all sides in Picoult's books, showing us that we cannot view situations in black and white - there are way too many shades of gray.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I saw the ending coming a mile away.  No surprises for me, but it was still quite the page turner.

Loved the Actors & Actresses, Plot and Suspense. Yes, it was Graphic. However, that made the storyline all the more believable. In my humble opinion, I felt the subject matter coupled with this cast of characters was excellent! Hence, Pleasantly Surprised!!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Brunhilde is a fish-girl who lives in the sea and one day gets the taste of BLOOD!  Sounds like the start of a bad B-movie of horror and bad special effects but it isn't.  Nope, this is Studio Ghibli.<br />Brunhilde is renamed Ponyo by the little boy who saves her, and feeds her ham.  Ponyo falls in love with the boy and refuses to stay in the sea, to the point where she ends up re-starting a massive evolutionary boom within the sea.  She returns to land, bringing with her animals who have not been seen for millions, in some cases billions, of years.  She also ends up flooding the local island.  And makes the Moon start to slowly fall to Earth.  No, not joking.  Her father must now try to figure out how to restore the balance before things go totally out of control.  It turns out that Ponyo can live as a human and the world will be saved if she can pass a test.  If not she will turn into sea foam, which if I remember right can happen to mermaids in myth, and, I assume, the Moon will crash into the Earth and we all die.<br />Ponyo loves Sosuke, the boy, the balance of nature is restored and everybody lives.<br />Now, let me say I like this film but I don't love it.  I love Howl's Moving Castle and the other films by Studio Ghibli and I enjoyed this one also.  The characters are cute, the artwork and landscape is wonderful and I enjoyed some of the magic and wonder the creators brought to the film.  Now, I was not too happy about Liam Neeson as the father Fujimoto, he seemed wooden, and sometimes I wondered at the reaction of the adults to many of the events in the story.  I mean, look, ancient sea creatures are appearing, the land is being flooded, the night sky is raining stars, and the Moon is coming down!  I was waiting for  many of the adults to start screaming in horror, crying in the corner, and babbling about the coming of the Deep Ones.<br />But kids will enjoy it!  Just have lots of ham afterwards, they will want HAM, and don't eat any seafood for the next few weeks.  And stay out of the water.  ENJOY!ew weeks.  And stay out of the water.  ENJOY!

She tries to make her good but she won't listen to the wizard.  The wizard is very mean to everyone but her sister because she turned her sister into a bad witch.  She is very mean to people.  I like the movie because it is different from the original Wizard of Oz.  I also like the movie more because it is so colorful.<br /> I like that Oz the Great and Powerful is different than the Wizard of Oz.  I liked how the wizard is nicer.  The wizard helps more people.  The wizard has different colored hair.  \\"Great and Powerful\\" has a lot more action in it.  In Oz the Great and Powerful, there is no Dorothy.  The main character is the wizard.  I liked the new movie better than the original.<br /> I like oz the great and powerful because it was a very colorful movie.  I like  the color of the sky when the wizard flies it is a very pretty blue the good witch dress was a beautiful combination of white and blue. The river in the movie was lovely. The movie was made with great o colors.<br />I liked the movie oz the great and powerful because it is different than the original wizard of oz and because it was so colorful.  I recommend you go and see it.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|We adore this giraffe because our son adores it.  Around 6 weeks he could focus on the giraffe and stared at it, especially the black and white foot.  Next came the discovery of the mirror, and for a good two months he'd entertain himself with that foot.  Then he began tugging on the ring, following by gumming all the feet.  At nine months he still whacks the giraffe, babbles to it, moves it around, and overall just really enjoys his toy.  He is distraught when traveling without this toy and will fuss until it's on the seat--even if he then ignores it.<br /><br />We now give this to all new parents and donated a few at Christmastime.  It's a great toy that covers multiple stages of your baby, and for $9 you cover the whole car seat toy thing.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|I like the song Hit the Lights by Selena Gomez. I liked when all of the lights went crazy. I like when the lights go off and Selena Gomez started to sing the song. Selena Gomez`s song Hit the Lights is awesome. She is the best singer on earth!<br />  Lights<br />I like when one light shined on Selena Gomez. When she was shined on, all of the four parts of the stage were lit up by her favorite colors green and red. Then all of the lights went crazy.<br />  Singing<br />I like when Selena Gomez went in the back of the stage and sang when she was walking down the stairs. I like when she let people have a high five. I like when Selena Gomez had a little rap in the middle. I like when Selena Gomez had a fast song. Selena Gomez had a slow song at the end.<br /><br />  Conclusion<br />Selena Gomez is a good singer and you should go to one of her concerts!

B003ZSJ212|4.0|The first Star Wars movie was made 1977. In 2013 there are only 6 but in 2015 there will 8 movies! Disney is making them. Star Wars is the best movie. Star Wars has a good story. Star Wars is awesome.<br /><br />Star wars has a good story. There are 6. It is all about Luke. He is a Jedi with a light up sword. It can cut through anything. He uses it to cut through aliens.<br /><br />Star Wars is awesome because there is a lot of fighting. It has a mix of action and adventure. There are a lot of planets.<br /><br />I like star wars is the best. They made up the Clone Wars from 1 and 2 it is almost pg13.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This continues to introduce Spartacus and further delve into the characters introduced in the prequel<br />Still lots of action, blood and gore, sex and LANGUAGE- yikes<br />Andy Whitfield is fabulous in this first season  unfortunately he passed away in 2011 and a new actor is to take his place in the 2nd season<br />This is certainly something you dont expect to see on TV  as it is RRRacey  but  all the actors are amazing and the story thus far a kind of  historical fiction as there is a lot of questions about Spartacus himself - is pretty believable -this is the way it was in Rome- the producers do a great job using what they have gleened to make this story pretty realistic it certainly is a WOW  epic

B000HT3PPG|5.0|I purchased this DVD set for my daughter for x-mas. This classic is one of our family favorites! It has everything in it; romance, drama, comedy, and adventure. I personally prefer this 1947 version over the newer one. Good, clean entertainment for the entire family.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I used to be a huge Kathy Reichs fan. Unfortunately, her last few books have been so annoying. Tempe's romance with Ryan in her early books was so fun and sexy, but for some sad reason Reichs decided to pull the plug on their relationship.<br /><br />Her overuse of names of police buildings, police departments, police titles, etc and all of their initials - all in French! Guess what, we don't care which Canadian police unit is handling which case! The writing style is still very entertaining and the stories are well researched and interesting, so I give Ms. Reichs kudos for that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing! I don't think you need to spend actual money on this game. I have about six horses and that's without paying for them. You should definitely buy this game is your interested in horses!
B00BF11STU|2.0|Acting very poor, premise was lax as most of us had already seen the pix and story via the media.  Next time release this type of movie earlier to avoid being 'scooped' by the Lame-stream media!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best written, and most creative book I've read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down. As soon as I was finished , I had to download Mockingjay, the second book.  Katnisss, the heroine, will steal your heart and break it all at the same time. It was colorful and full of action at every turn. This is not a chick book.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|love that movie, music was great, swayze and grey were great dancing was fantastic i have watched it more times<br />than i can count
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Thank you for all the apps I have downloaded. it is so quick..I love to be able to to get the songs I love.I really do love this.My grand daughter told me about a song called &#34;MY ANGEL&#34; ...she was referring to me... so I downloaded it,and made me cry....Thanks again,Amazon...
B00A93ENX8|2.0|sound audio is good but seriously it was cheaply done in 2 channel stereo where the really good profesinal sacds are done in 5.1 and also offer 2 channel. i don't mind paying a premium for the ones that have taken the time to really put out a great product regrettably this is not one of those.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!<br />I recommend this book for people that like a long funny sort of a problem story books. It's a fun book really ties it in at the end. I'm recommending this book for ages 6+
1400052173|5.0|This book is a &#34;must read.&#34;  Very interesting to learn how the medical community &#34;operated&#34; back in the day.  To learn that Henrietta died back in the early 50's and for her cells to still be alive today is amazing.  And how ironic that the HELA (HEnrietta LAcks) cells helped find vaccines and cures and her poor family didn't have medical insurance!  Well written and kudos to the author for getting the story out on Henrietta and her cells.  May she rest in peace knowing that she continues to contribute to the advancement in medicine.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed had me smiling, crying, laughing, crying then smiling again! This is a raw and emotional book about loss, love and life. Cannot wait for the next book to come out. Thank you Ms. Hoover!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|nice. good. exalent .I think that the game should graded a 5out of5.I love the game so mutch I gave it my time to rate it.
B001KVZ6ES|4.0|I received  my video quckly and was very happy with  it.. Can't wait to see what else I can buy.
B006BXTOFC|3.0|This sound is dated and unimaginative. I understand the retro sound, but only when there's a purpose. I just don't get it in this album. I was all excited to listen to the award-winning album, and I was terribly disappointed. There's just nothing special to it.<br /><br />Let the hatting begin... :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put this series down! It was action packed with a gripping love triangle of sorts. Even though this may be intended for a younger audience, as an adult I still really enjoyed this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Realistic movement, needs a larger variety of horses that don't cost gems especially unicorns! Also could be more activities to raise health and happiness.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Its nice to read a military book that isn't lamenting all the poor training and the bad politics of war. The author is certainly a patriot which makes the book meaningful. However there is not much detail to his life story. Certainly not anywhere near the detail of books like Marine Sniper about Carlos Hathcock. Also it reads like an autobiography.  The author apparently never lost a bar fight and always made the right decisions in war.  That's to be expected in an autobiography. It's a good book but not a great book. It will hold your interest and restore your faith in those who have dedicated their lives to protecting this country.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so good I can not get oh buff of this I get on it mostly every day y
0061906220|5.0|My son just turned 3, and we got him this book almost a year ago.  He has loved it since the beginning, and we love reading it to him.  It's got great rhythm, is fun to sing the refrain aloud, and the illustrations are wonderful.  This is one of the ways we first got him interested in learning his primary colors.  We read this book aloud to a friend's child (who's the same age as my son) and he loved it so much, that they bought the book also.  They tell me it is a favorite in their house, too.<br /><br />Pete is not going anywhere...I will keep this book forever, to hand down to my children's children someday.
B00B19GKI0|1.0|Wow. Don't waste your time. Seriously. This will be 1.5 hours of your life thrown down the toilet. Horrible acting and sets, pathetic special effects, etc. I could go on, but that would just be wasting more of my time. Luckily, I was cooking and doing chores while I was watching so at least I got some productivity out of it, but dang - as a movie, or as any form of entertainment, don't even bother.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It does what I need it to and id very pretty not as good as the more expensive ones but works for me.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Great for hiking around. If your concerned about losing them or something they are cheap to replace. Very good sound for the price. Would recommend.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|FOR a game on kindle fire, it's a pretty good way to spend a quiet afternoon.  Only bad thing is, it's not really playableunless you use the hints.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I  have loved this game for years.  It is entertaining and addicting.  You can play with one, two, three for all four suits.  You can choose between a random deal or a definite winning deal.  I prefer the random deal and try my best to win.

B008ALA6DW|5.0|Quality was pretty good. I got what I expected, It arrived pretty fast. Price was also good. I'm glad with this item.
B0090SI4LU|1.0|I really try to go into every movie, based off of a book, with an open mind. I understand that especially if it's a long intricate story, it's going to look a little different on the big screen. Everyone's perseption and understanding of a story is different. However the spirit of the story and it's characters should still shine through; there should be a definite correlation between movie and book.<br /><br />I loved Stephenie Meyer's book, The Host. It was a well writen book about an alien race that's main goal and concern is to rid the world of violence and negativity and foster a loving environment. It is a book about learning to walk a mile in someone elses shoes, what it means to love in all of loves different facets, and how to care for others even when others are unkind or even cruel. I was very excited to see the movie because with the exception of Eclipse I loved all of the Twilight movies. However, I was very disappointed!!<br /><br />The movie was not only rushed but it didn't have any of the depth that the book had! You didn't get to know or appreciate any of the characters, especially Melanie and Wanda. Quite frankly, had I not read the book I would have been confused and bored. I saw the movie with my sister and law and the term she used to describe this movie was, \\"lame!\\" Even the caves were all wrong. It looked like the characters were living in a jail instead of a cave! What's with the glow worms?! That was not in the book! Where was Walter, Wes, Candy, Jodi, and Sunny? To be honest, I think this book would have been better off left as a book! It's such an intricate story and hard to script for the big screen without mutilating it. I wish I wouldn't have gone to see this movie.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|My kids enjoy it, the task of collecting the gems and reaching the goal point is simple enough for them to understand. Continuous running, what can be better than that for little kids, nothing complicated to complete yet interesting enough to keep them wanting to play it.
B006OITIQE|5.0|As a grandmother, &#34;What Makes You Beautiful&#34; gives me good subject matter to discuss with my 10 year old granddaughter as does &#34;One Thing&#34;.

B00A03WBVI|5.0|Very talented young men. &#34;Little Things&#34; really showcases their style and harmony. &#34;Kiss You&#34; fun and flirty. Some songs too risque for youth, but what's a grandma know?
0316077046|3.0|I enjoyed this second novel in the Beautiful Creatures quartet; however, I couldn't help feeling that I was getting a lot more of the teen angst that permeated the first novel as well. The story is fun, and some new characters and mythology are introduced to extend the story. Overall, I am still enjoying this series, and still fond of the hero. Though the male character is likable, I must point out that the persona and behavior of the female lead reminds one very much of the heroine of another very famous young adult series featuring a sullen girl and the vampire and werewolf that battle for her love. This book brings a new girl into the hero's life that is far more appealing. Just starting the third book.<br />Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\"
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I would have preferred that the sexual content not be in the movie, but other than that, it was a great telling of a magnificent, convoluted, complex story.  All human ills and virtues are part of LM and well portrayed by the actors.  Hathaway captured fully the pain of a mother unable to care for her child. Very moving. Some versions give too much humanity to the Maser of the House, but this movie shows him as the criminal sociopath he really is.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|After I watched the movie, I decided to read the book.. I should have read the book first!<br />Such a nice philosophy going in the book.. Absolutely loved it!
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Well acted. Jude Law was wonderful, as always.Knightly very believable as good woman, making very poor choices which cascade into pain for so many.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie, simply because I didn't hate it as I expected. The previews looked fairly dull and standard and overall predictable. I was surprised and pleased by the emotional depth and the realism within the storyline. The acting is top notch, the graphics are perfect and the soundtrack is fittingly epic. My only real complaint is that it wasn't a longer film, I would have happily watched this for another hour and a half.  It didn't blow my mind or anything on that scale but it was very good and very entertaining.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I am a big fan of Science Fiction which stretches the imagination.<br />My family suggested i try the firefly series.  I highly recommend this movie.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I only buy the movies the I really like and the music in it is great.  It came when and as it was suppose to
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game really. holds your attention. its really a fun game. its fun to create all the different animals from the movie.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|For Pink Floyd fans, especially those that were not alive when they made the original albums or toured, this is a perfiect gift. You will not be disappointed with the sound. While the packaging may have been a little more, if I wanted to read I would have gotten a book. But as far as the music is concerned..almost as good as the original vinyl.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved it with all my heart. I finally have a book that I can come home and reread  countless times.
B00005QDW5|5.0|As a gift for someone who is not familiar with Pink Floyd, this was a great introduction. They were not disappointed and is now looking forward to getting the albums themselves. You won't be disappointed.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's awesome I love it and I like that it lets me talk to my friends whenever and I would say that my friends like it to.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I am so hooked. I heard some friends at work talking about it and decided to watch the first episode. After that I had to see the rest of the episodes.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Scribblenauts is a really fun app. I would of given it 5stars except there is not a lot of levels. Once there is more levels the game will be awesome.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|fun game great for all ages.<br />both myself and my daughter play the game.<br />Would purchase again.<br />Fun game to pay and challanging
B00BI73CVI|5.0|There are many naysayers as far as Russell Crowe's performance but going deeper into the actual story it was acted and sung to perfection.  Hugh Jackman's performance alone is spellbinding forever answering the question &#34;Is he only capable of being Wolverine?&#34;
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Beautiful, quirky and hilarious.  I love how the author gave the narrator a distinct \\"voice\\".  I really enjoyed this book.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I have seen almost every movie made of Pride and Prejudice,as well as every movie loosely based on it. It has been one of my favorite stories of all time. Yet, up till now, I had never actually read the original story, the book.<br /><br />I am so glad I did! I already knew the story by heart, but the book filled in so many gaps that I had not even know we're missing. Could not put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just amazing like if you get the free Amazon one it's  really good if  your board sometime  just go on your I phone because my mom gave me a I phone  for my birthday and it is just great it works on a kindle fire I pod I phone tablet and many more so it is really awesomely awsome :-)
B001NHNG64|5.0|Fast paced, intriguing dialogue,easy to read.  This is my second &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; book and it won't be my last.  Good book.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The positive reviews about this movie are no secret and they're fully justified. If you have the opportunity to watch it in 3D by all means do. It adds another dimension (no pun intended) that really enhances the beauty of what is already a spectacular film.
B00003OSU4|5.0|I saw this movie at my home town way back in time. Searched a long time to find it on DVD. I loved to see and listen again to this fabulous music.
B008518MOW|5.0|We've all probably read the reviews about how Josh Brolin does such a bang up job playing the young Tommy Lee Jones and having now watched the movie I wholeheartedly agree. Brolin simply IS the young Tommy Lee.<br /><br />If you can, see it in 3D. It simply adds an element of fun; a new dimension (pun intended) that you just don't get with 2D.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it a good game an it is awsome i play it all the time it is the best uorse game
B005CRY2O6|5.0|This is a wonderful and fun to read cookbook.  I have a hard time eating my vegetables and this lovely and delicious recipe collection makes me want to cook more vegetables in a different way. Highly recommend it if you love or hate vegetables.
0307352145|5.0|Even though I have known about introversion and extroversion for years, I gained a lot of new information from this book. She explains that in previous years, people judged others based on their character rather than how outgoing they were. Nowadays, people are conditioned to believe that having a positive, outgoing \\"go getter\\" attitude is what makes a person have a good personality. Unfortunately for us introverts, because we don't fit society's ideal of extroversion, we are judged as being less intelligent, less friendly, etc. This book explains that not only is it perfectly normal to not have these attributes, but there are also many benefits to being an introvert that society doesn't seem to recognize. I only wish that extroverts and companies that are hiring, etc knew this information. It seems like it is basically okay to discriminate against introverts and not the other way around.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I was really bored with this book for probably the first half of it. However, the plot picked up quickly and then it was very exciting and there was captivating imagery I lost myself in. Overall, I'd say not the best book but not a waste of time.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This applaication fulfills my need to have different translations that I can carry with me and use with my Kindle Fire!

B0064MGU98|5.0|When The Good Wife first aired I had no intention of watching the program.  Despite liking the cast, it looked like the usual evening soap opera which I find utterly uninteresting.  I was pleasantly surprised when in a fit of boredom I watched the first episode of season 1.  I found myself engaged in both the story line and characters.  The acting is superb.  Julianna Margulies was so immersed in her character that I didn't even think once (past the opening credits) about her role as a nurse on ER.  I've not had this reaction to acting since Helen Mirren's performance in Prime Suspect.  Not that this show is as good or gritty as Prime Suspect, the two are not comparable - but the acting is.  Christine Baranski was her usual wonderful self, though I did find myself hoping that she'd say &#34;Doctor Dick&#34; just once.  And Alan Cumming pretty much steals every scene he is in.<br /><br />The story line is engaging, despite the occasional flaws.  Mary Beth Peil's character Jackie Florrick is so wonderfully written and acted that I've wondered what the inspiration for her is.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|it is another great movie of mark wahlberg keep them coming<br />it is another great movie of mark wahlberg keep them coming
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Though Season 2 is not quite as good as Season 1; it is still a highly engaging show and the acting continues to be superb.  Though I would like to see the dialogue lifted up a level, it is always nice to watch a show where people speak in complete sentences.  I embarrassed to be one of those people, the ones so hooked on a show that they watch it non-stop, but I am.  I watched Season 2 in much the same way I read an excellent book - I don't stop until its done.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|What can I say, I am hooked.  Easier to just buy the set to turn on friends and be able to keep forever.

B0041KVZ18|1.0|When I first heard about the Beatles music being remastered and produced on vinyl again I was so excited! I have been one of their biggest fans of their music for years now and expected great things as a consumer of their work.  All my beatles albums are used and not in new condition and I wanted to buy some albums so that I could enjoy the vinyl without worrying about any problems with them.  I read the reviews of people getting bad beatles records and I was going to take a chance that I would get some good ones.  I was so wrong.  It ruined my love for vinyl.<br /><br />Do you realize how frustrating and disappointing it is to listen to some brand new beatles albums and have that love of vinyl and their music be completely crushed?  These past three weeks have been pretty bad.  I changed out the White Album two times with no luck for a good copy.  A skip and pop on each of them.  I also changed out Sgt. Pepper a couple of times also.  A few clicks on the first copy, a lot of static on the second copy on the first two songs on the reverse side.  Nothing but crap.  Since I don't live near a UPS place, I had to keep on going to the post office returning for a different copy and paying postage fees even though I was later reimbursed on my account.  After three complete weeks, I had enough.<br /><br />I would strongly suggest for Amazon to contact EMI or Apple Records or whoever makes the vinyl and have them recall all the records that were sent to Amazon and whoever else and produce new ones again....(even though I won't be a buyer.)<br /><br />The customer service representatives were very helpful in getting my refunds for the postage and albums done, but I had to be persistant with the emails.  So much hassle for nothing.  A brand new record should not skip.  I REPEAT.....A BRAND NEW RECORD SHOULD NOT SKIP!!!!  To tell you the truch of course I still love vinyl and always will, but will stick with used records and not buy new ones ever again.  Instead I am buying theremastered Audio CD's which are basically guaranteed not to skip.  Vinyl is old technology....I REPEAT.....VINYL IS OLD TECHNOLOGY!!!  So you can't expect OLD vinyl to be perfect even though I expected NEW vinyl to be.<br /><br />So if you are debating about purchasing the new beatles albums on vinyl, I would strongly suggest not to!  Stick with the CD's and find some cheap used beatles records on ebay to try.  You will pay a much lower price for about the same sound quality which, even though used, may not have any problems at all!<br /><br />I hope my review has helped other Beatle lovers to stop from making a mistake like I did when it comes to the Beatles great music.<br /><br />From a disgusted but wiser vinyl buyer.<br /><br />Andrew

B0071XO8RA|3.0|At the end of the book, when I reflected on the several hundred pages that I'd journeyed through, I realized that the recency effect was actually in the very first line of the story. This is a good thing to me!<br />As a beginner in fiction writing myself, I've gone through all the advice of experts preaching: \\"Get them from the start... Lead with a skull exploding, blade slicing a throat, blood gushing... etc.\\" I find that very tasteless and dated. Pick most thrillers and you'll get such cliche beginnings.<br />Howey instead, starts with: \\"The children were playing while Holsten climbed to his death; he could hear them squealing as only happy children do...\\" Almost the modern version of (and paraphrasing) \\"It was the worst of times...it was the best of times\\"  Now this is a gripping first line that seizes your attention.<br /><br />I won't lie... this was a slow read for me, and I found myself skipping along some sections (my loss). Some of the 'science' was also questionable, but of course this is not meant to a bible on dystopian life.<br />After sometime, I made it a habit to disconnect the wifi on my Ipad before settling in to a reading session of Wool. Oh, I'd love to have read this on a Kindle, but wouldn't you know it *shocker* either Amazon or the Publisher does not think people living in Dubai are advanced enough to consume fiction on e-readers, so e-books and the kindle itself is not officially available. You have to be seen lugging DTBs around in 2013. Thankfully KOBO came to the rescue.<br /><br />The Wool saga is well written. The attention to details/particularity do paint a vivid picture of the settings. The 'camera' glides in effortlessly in Howey's hands when framing a scene and lending insights into the characters POV.<br />Yes, I will go see the movie.<br /><br />Well done Mr. Howey.<br />Why am I giving it 3 stars and not 4?<br />Two reasons: (1) Four and Five stars are overated and no one reads those reviews (Wool's ratings wont go down with over 4000 reviews)<br />(2) Not Howey's fault but because Amazon is not doing enough to bring e-books to everyone. If Kobo and Smashwords can do it, what's your excuse?er 4000 reviews)<br />(2) Not Howey's fault but because Amazon is not doing enough to bring e-books to everyone.

038533348X|1.0|I picked up this book on audiobook because my library had it, and I heard it's a famous book, so I wanted to give it a shot. Audiobook by Caedmon, unabridged, 6 CDs (7 hrs), which also includes recordings of interviews with the author on the last disk. In addition, I borrowed the print version, just to compare notes, from Dial Press.<br /><br />The title of the book \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is very indicative of what the story is like. It starts at a point where the protagonist (Jonah) is trying to write a book about the end of the world, which is actually about Felix Hoenniker, a brilliant but odd scientist who invented the atomic bomb. The protagonist says right away \\"I am a bokononist\\", which we later find out is something he becomes at the END of the book. So, it's unclear the order of the writing, which I think was done in purpose, like an infinity loop.<br /><br />In the beginning Jonah is seeking interviews with people related to Hoeniker, and as he meets people they give him further suggestions of people to talk to and so on, and so on, so he's building a \\"web\\" of people (kind of how the strings look when playing the game). Then he goes to an Island, San Lorenzo, to meet Hoennikers children (who are middle aged adults now). On the island, he learns about a new religion, Bokononism, and he also learns about how lazy the people are, how they don't question anything, don't strive for anything, and don't like to fight. Throughout the book Vonnegut introduces words like \\"karass\\" and \\"bokonomatu\\" which are parts of the religion.<br /><br />I found Cat's Cradle to be pretty boring. The interviews were boring. The island was dull. There was so much ridiculousness (ie making LOVE through feet), that it made the story obviously unbelievable and hard to relate to. There is just a lot of stuff that I found myself rolling my eyes at. I knew it couldn't be true, and I just felt it was all pointless, and couldn't wait for it to be over. It's just a completely looney story.<br /><br/>Can you say that the title of the book is correct? Is it a Cat's Cradle? Well, yes. You could draw lots of lines connecting people to other people, and to events. It's all messy and crazy just like the game. But is this book worth reading? No. I read Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5, and that was MUCH better! Worlds apart.<br /><br />I did not like this book. I don't think it deserves critical acclaim. Further, it should be categorized as sci-fi or fantasy, bc none of the stuff would ever happen in real life.<br /><br />My favorite part were the interviews with Vonnegut at the end of the book! haha
B002RI9UBS|3.0|Does the ending make it worth reading?  No.  This would have been better as a short story.<br />I was lured to read this because of the religious themes, and I found it wanting.  It was uninspiring, and the story left me feeling sorry for the character.  It taught a lesson that I already knew - humans are stronger than they think.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|A fun way to relax 10 minutes everyday. Love the audio. And glad this game can be fun to play without spending money.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I've been using this app for quite some time now and find it extremely useful.<br />It keeps me up to date on how much of the battery is left to use!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A whole new twist with many turns in this one that I really liked and more then held my attention all the way with a surprise ending. Could not put it down.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|So long candy crush saga! This is better, and FREE!<br />What could be better! And no kiddie take off on Chutes and Ladders!
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|The only bummer about this series is waiting for the next episode!  Everyone I introduce this series to also falls in love with the show!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|whether you prefer dramas or action, this movie should do it. Love, family, hunting, murder, etc. I would watch it again.
B007EECSFA|2.0|This had a fair story, but it was hard to read.  The story kept changing from one time period to the next making it hard to follow.  I am not a fan of mystery I prefer someone to just tell it like it is and not beat around the bush doing it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is completely outstanding.  Virtually any object you can imagine will show up and interact with others on the screen.  The inclusion of adjectives expands possibilities and interactions.  Unexpected results are pleasant surprises, and playing as a group results in different experiences.  Everyone will solve the levels differently.<br /><br />A couple of tips:<br />1) Holding your finger on the screen makes Maxwell walk, if you're having trouble moving objects around try swiping them around instead of pressing and moving.<br />2) Characters and items turn blue when placing an item on them, other items have to be emptied or interacted with by Maxwell.<br />3) If you can't spawn any objects, try pressing the return key on your keyboard instead of the &#34;enter&#34; button on the notepad.<br />4) Be careful with the cloning machine.
