B00GOZQ2E8|4.0|I'd give it 5 stars, except for the fact that once you get to about a Level 11, it's almost impossible to beat any monsters, even with all 5 heroes! I keep upgrading their armor, but the monsters just keep getting more difficult.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Instead of rummaging through my kindle looking for files to delete this godsend of an app cleans up the cache, and helps delete the stuff you don't need. It'll also uninstall apps.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is controlling me!!  Uk. its a very challageing game ..love it...play candy crush rmevery day...lots of fun to try and beat the levelss past my kids.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is great for collages and simple photo editing it's not quite Photoshop or Corel Graphics Suite, nothing is for phone or mobile application but it has great options.
0783114893|5.0|I think this is a very good movie it really had me on the edge of my seat I enjoyed every moment of it I would recommend this movie to anybody
1451627297|5.0|This is Stephen King at his finest — the best I have seen from him since his magnificent novels &#34;It&#34; and &#34;The Stand.&#34;<br /><br />I got this book on Audible initially, fell in love with it immediately, and went on to buy a copy of the actual book itself (just so I could hold it in my hands and feel its heft ... and look up favorite parts to read myself).  I even went on to buy copies of the books for three other people, just because I couldn't contain how incredible this book has proven.<br /><br />Today I finished.  And I felt physically WIPED OUT.  That's how powerful it is.  I don't think I have felt this strong of a reaction to the completion of a book since Confessions of Nat Turner (Styron), Sometimes a Great Notion (Kesey), and A Prayer for Owen Meany (Irving).  It's that good.  You just sit there afterward.  Shellshocked.  And all you want to do ... is go back to the beginning to start through it again.<br /><br />The Audible version of the book was spectacular.  The voice of the narrator was perfect.  The accents he gives to the various characters are truly masterful.  I've listened to a lot of recorded books, and this narrator was one of my favorites by far.  If you can get it on Audible, do so.  I think it made what was already a 5-Star novel into a 10-Star performance.<br /><br />If you are looking for a truly awesome book that will utterly captivate you — this is it.  Magnificent work!<br /><br />PS:  If you haven't yet read Stephen King's incredible novel &#34;It,&#34; you may want to read that before going on to 11/22/63.  The crossover is delicious.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Loved the book, hated the movie.  Bad acting.  Though its close the book, it just didn't translate well.  What a shame.
B0081SRJSY|1.0|After installing it on my micro SD card, and playing with it a little,  my android phone started acting funny so I restarted it and it informed me that my card was now damaged. Might be a coincidence, but I'm uninstalling the game anyway.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|If you like the Romeo and Juliet movie with Leo Dicaprio you will like this too.  It has that modern high art feel.  All in all decent movie.
B00003CXXS|5.0|Love the Jurassic Park movie sequels all are great films and III is even better bought it used works great and the case is in good condition.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|I was really looking forward to this prequel of Monsters, Inc. because I am such a fan of the first movie, and while I enjoyed it, it lacks the magic of the first movie.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|Entertaining game. Tough levels, funds hard to come by, but fun.<br />Like the use of character voices from the movie.<br />Enjoy killing monsters and time.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Very predictable story, acting was fine.  Not a movie for purchase, rent or what and get for free on a service.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Kept me intrigued and up night after night not wanting to put it down. Great storyline and tension built until the climax. Felt invested emotionally into the main characters and by the end I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Brilliant
B0041CGP02|5.0|Just a great collection at a great price. It's Bon Jovi with all his wonderful songs in one package-Good Job
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Morricone could not have been interpreted any more exquisitely than by Yo-Yo Ma.  This music helps one transcend to a high spiritual 'place'.
B000H305U0|5.0|Not to say that N'Sync held Justin back, but if his first solo album &#34;Justified&#34; didn't convince that he was ready to spread his wings, this album will.  I truly believe that this album is the &#34;Thriller&#34; for the modern era.  The album is excellent, with top notch production from R&B/Hip Hop giant Timbaland, and a perfect blend of Pop, R&B, Funk and Techno.  The album produced 6 singles including the ultimate Summer jam &#34;Sexy Back&#34;, as well as several others like &#34;Lovestoned&#34;, &#34;Sexy Ladies&#34;, &#34;What Goes Around&#34; and &#34;Summer Love&#34;.<br /><br />After such a successful album and tour it seemed strange for him to shift gears and focus on acting (and his personal life) but this album will be nearly impossible to match so he probably felt like he was in no rush to attempt it.  His latest effort &#34;The 20/20 Experience&#34; is another solid release (Both Parts 1 & 2) but this is the album people will remember most; it should be on every list of the best Pop albums (up there with &#34;Purple Rain&#34;, &#34;Thriller&#34;, etc.).
B00EEXST2K|4.0|Great story well acted.  Linda had her 15 minutes of fame for being raped on film. Sad situation. Check it out.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Don't let my title deceive you into thinking this is a Sammy Hagar solo album, I simply say \\"one of Sammy's best\\" because most people probably heard of Chickenfoot through following Sammy.  Chickenfoot is not \\"Sammy with backing band\\", more like his Wabos.<br /><br />This is a great album for the people who miss the Sammy Hagar/Michael Anthony harmonies from Van Halen.  In my opinion, you can hear Mike's vocals (and bass) more on this than on any Van Halen album (from both Sammy and DLR eras).<br /><br />Some people may wonder why Chickenfoot named their 2nd album \\"III\\" but if you compare it to their debut it should be obvious, being such a huge jump in how tight the band sounds.  The first album sounded more like a recorded jam session, much more raw and unpolished like much of Sammy's solo material, but everything from the lyrics and song structure to the music on this album is like what you'd expect from a band who's been playing together for much longer.  In other words, the first album reflected the short time they had been playing together but this album sounds like they've already been together for a decade so it's like they just skipped what their 2nd album would have been like.<br /><br />Joe Satriani's playing on this album is some of the best he's ever done (in my opinion) starting with the opening riff and solo from \\"Up Next\\".  Anyone who says that song doesn't stand up to the best that Van Halen's ever done is in denial.  Likewise with \\"Big Foot\\", another heavy rocker, but then there is a song like \\"Come Closer\\" with more of an R&B flavor, and the way Joe wraps the notes around the chorus is perfect.<br /><br />Chad Smith continues to beat the hell out of the drums and show that his Funk stylings from the Red Hot Chili Peppers are just one of many tricks up his sleeve.  By the time \\"Three and a Half Letters\\" is done, you'll wonder how Chad's drum kit survived the song!  Sammy's vocals are still impressively solid, must be the tequila!  For a guy in his mid 60's, he can still hit very high notes, and the only time you really hear any strain is on the \\"Letters\\" song, but due to the nature of the song he was just going full throttle.  For me, one of the tracks that really stood out was \\"Different Devil\\" because it's sung in a style completely different than anything Sammy had done in VH, and the backing vocals and harmonies are some of the best ever from Mike.<br /><br />I don't see any reason why fans of the Sammy Hagar era of Van Halen wouldn't love this.  If you're a fan of Sammy's solo work, not sure this is your cup of tea because his solo material has a different flavor.  This album, for me, sounds as strong or stronger than anything he did with Van Halen.  Unlike how things were going towards the end of Sammy's tenure in VH, this is a real collaboration among all 4 members and it shows.  Great album, lots of rockers, with some great slower and mid-tempo songs too!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!mid 60's, he can still hit very high notes, and the only time you really hear any strain is on the \\"Letters\\" song, but due to the nature of the song he was just going full throttle.

B000002HH2|5.0|This is one of my favourite albums from Björk. Isobel by far, one of the best song composed in the modern music industry.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I like this game because it is fun and easy to customize. You get different achievements everything you do something on the game (like winning your first game, using a lot of hints, etc). It's become my alternate game that I play on my phone constantly besides candy crush saga, and much easier. When you exit out of it, it saves the game you were on also, which is cool because you can finish that one or start a new one if you want.
B000002HPV|5.0|Along with Post, Debut, Vespertine and Biophilia, this is an album to have in mind every time you hear the word 'Masterpiece'.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Good special effects which are nice in some parts.  The stories a little cheezy, not that I don't believe a virus couldn't kill a whole lot of people, but they would remain dead. First Zombie movie ....ok
B00FPH6M82|4.0|Not the best movie I have seen Will Smith or his son in. But defiantly a decent one. I enjoyed it, although they could have made it to be so much more. Disappointed in some ways, very impressed in others. Glad I watched it!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I love the villain!  He is really a smart, clever,  kick ass guy.  Who needs anyone else! Superior race yes indeed...give me some of that blood.
B00GIXWHZ4|5.0|Was an amazing movie, keeps you on your toes in anticipation. I LOVED Origins of Wolverine and this one is defiantly up there with it. Worth the rent and even possibly a buy. Hugh Jackman is, The Wolverine!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|The harsh reality!  People with money can do just about anything.  It would be extremely sad to know 90% of the people and everything else in the world was gone....It really blows your mind if you think about it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is cool it changed . My life i hate it it is not good at all but it is also good at the same time
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I would of bought this tape just for the first few minutes of landscape shots. It's almost too beautiful to even think it's real.  Certainly you want to go there and see it for yourself
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book on recommendation from a close friend and I am so glad I did. I really enjoyed this quick read and it was hard to put it down. I look forward to reading the remainder of the series. The story is very engaging.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Beautiful from beginning to end.  The plot is good i.e. the take over of a people for something that we want. Doesn't matter what happens to the men, women or children.  Buy it you won't regret it!
B007REV4YI|4.0|Great movie, however I dropped it a star because of the way they have digital copies set up now. It's completely stupid.
0143121006|4.0|Excellent nonfiction mystery about a place and time with which I was not familiar, Peking before WW II. I recommend this book.

193413712X|4.0|This is a beautiful book.  I thought Harding did a masterful job of weaving the past and the present into a single man's life as he faced the end of his days.  What the author does here is incredible because he takes such a huge expanse of time, rushes it, prolongs it, and also shows how it influences our memories, our relationships, and our outlook.<br /><br />Moreover, I thought the ways he described George Washington Crosby's memories of his father was stunning -- beautiful at every turn -- and made me pause to think about my own relationship with the men in my family.  A very personal story about one man's death becomes something bigger in Harding's hands.  Because of that, I think anyone who thinks the American novel is dead should read it.
1609611543|5.0|This book contains eye opening information on the science of grains. It is hard to dispute the fact that grains do great harm to humans and it is criminal that the FDA Promotes this food as healthy.<br />A must read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|GREAT time killer. The more difficult levels may make you want to quit, but don't let a stupid game beat you!
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|Fun and Challenging.  This game will send you bonkers!  Sitting anywhere, and playing a level over and over and over will send you to the Nut Farm!  Isn't there anything that does't take hours to complete?  In fine; I refuse to be beaten. B.
6304765789|5.0|This movie was so so great! I felt like I had to figure out a puzzle the entire time. It was very suspenseful and kept me on alert. The movie is awesome all the way to the end!
B00005JMYI|3.0|The movie itself is pretty hilarious, but the case came a bit damaged. Three stars because of poor transporting and packaging. Maybe next time they will take care of the products better.
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|the Oops!...I Did It Again / Britney album Britney is back!!! This album is AMAZING!!! Every track is a hit! BEst one on the album is Chillin' With You (feat. Jamie Lynn) !!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Greasy for all my holiday shopping, easy to search through &amp; effective. Allowing me to bid from my tablet anywhere makes it all worth it.
B002I0J5FG|1.0|Avid gamer, but disappointed with the hype and really don't understand why people love this game.<br /><br />I can see how this game was considered great when it came out for PS2, but it really falls flat when compared with with PS3/next-gen titles.<br /><br />- Non-existent tutorial/flimsy story that is not fleshed out well. There isn't much of a story to follow<br />- Graphics are PS2 quality- HD remastered doesn't mean it's any different or particularly special<br />- Frustrating and very repetitive gameplay and laborious traveling required in missions- made me quit 25% through the game because of how much you have to travel and how tedious the missions are. Imagine walking up a really big ramp and making a jump over a gap... but you miss the jump because of weird angles and have to climb all the way back up the ramp...
B00B19G01C|5.0|Great movie. Matisyahu does a great job as well. I wonder what song he is singing on the stairs when he first meets the girl's dad?. I think if i am not mistaken that is a Papa San reggae song, not sure.<br /><br />But the movie is suspenseful enough for me
B009NY43NY|5.0|Once again a great read. The Sookie Stackhouse books are always entertaining. The ending was good. However I'm slightly disappointed. Mainly because I love Eric's character.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I find it a challenge and enjoy playing it. Something quick to play when you only have a few minutes.
B00536OCYG|5.0|Bought this record for my son who loves Pink Floyd.  There isn't anything negative you can say about this band or record - except that my son likes to play it more than I like to hear it :).
B007URVZJ6|2.0|I followed all your instructions in my Word document.  I used First Line Indent, took care not to enter extra spaces down, and used the Center icon on my Word 2010 toolbar.  It looked fine in the Word document, but Centering completely failed in your upload.  Centered items trailed down the right margin two letters at a time for two pages for the title and copyright page, and down the page two letters at a time for chapter numbers.  I'm told this is a common problem uploading for Kindle.  Because I spent two weeks trying to fix the problem in my Word file, I finally hired a formatter to get it into mobi.  I have half a dozen other books on Kindle, which I uploaded in Word.doc and Word.docx myself.  The last two came out perfectly.  This one was a nightmare, as if your upload program went back to its old glitches about things like centering.  You do not address how to fix a Word manuscript  you want to upload when this Centering problem, and others occur.  Just saying use the Center icon on the toolbar DOES NOT fix it.  And since I don't know .html, I could not correct any problems in that if found.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Good fast moving pace. Interesting characters and plot. Stuck close enough to book to not be disappointing. Enjoyed and look forward to sequel.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|So far I love it! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic games. Download it if you want fun.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|Guess I still like the old Rod that I grew up with and his work during the 80's. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|This is the greatest story of Batman ever told! An honest interpretation of Frank Miller's brilliant work. If you watch anything Batman this is a great place to start.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It is a pain when you have to pay for the whole version, but this was a good game for me yo spend our money on. This game has not gave me any problems, and keeps me wanting to come back and play it. PERFECT GAME!!!!

B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|I love BOSTON. No doubt. I was so excited to hear that they were coming out with a new album, and kept waiting for it to come out. I bought it. COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I HAD HEARD.  It's all slow love songs basically. I guess if you're into that stuff then it would be great for you. But Tom, where's the guitar solos? I heard like one solo in the whole album. The drum didn't sound that good, as it sounded exactly like the drum on the &#34;Walk On&#34; album. And a girl singing for a classic rock band? I don't get it. There were about 2 songs that I really liked off of the album. This isn't like BOSTON or Don't Look Back's albums at all. Even though I love Tom Scholz's creativity and his guitar playing, I would not recommend this to a BOSTON fan.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|While I admit that I spent a lot of time listening to the book while driving I struggled to get into it. not being one to put a book down without finishing I preserved. The plot skipped around too much for me for the first third of the book. Overall I was very disappointed as this came highly recommended.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really love this app. it has definitely done its job. Really works for people who doesn't have an alarm clock
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Good clean looking case that works good the price was lowered so I pick it an I'm more then happy with thanks amazon again
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I need codes for the kung funny taunt and the funny minion whatever that is called.But overall this game is very cool!Get it now!!!!!!!!
B00CGP0D1S|5.0|It's a masterpiece in every way! The photography, the special effects, the magic of the story. It's simply a great movie, very well done!
B000MDDSB8|4.0|I have always appreciated this movie. And by having Taylor Kitch in it is a MAJOR bonus. If you like the sexy super powered bad ass man with a heart, I think you would enjoy this. If not, just enjoy the man candy : )
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is one of those rare films you don't want to end. I saw it in theaters and instantly fell in love with the warmth and humor of the main characters. The pacing is seemless and the dialogue is genuine. Definitely worth watching with a good friend.<br /><br />I felt lucky to find it for such an affordable price.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|The movie was good and I did enjoy it, but there was just something missing where it could have been better.  But overall it was a good movie.
0064471837|4.0|This was a good start to the Abhorsen trilogy, which I absolutely love, but I didn't like this first book as much as the next two - although I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes childrens fantasy books.
B008EKON56|1.0|This is a poorly made product. I used it in my iPod Classic for two days. Then a piece of the connector broke off inside the iPod's input. I had to go to the Apple store to have them remove the broken piece. This cost so little because sometimes you get what you pay for. I bought a similar device from Headroom (headphone DOT com),  made by SendStation for about $25 and it has been working perfectly for months. Too much money for such a tiny device, I know, but at least it works to get the audio signal out and into my headphone amplifier bypassing the iPonds relatively crummy internal mini-op-amp without failing and wasting my time.
0060005424|5.0|This is one of the best books in the whole world, I'm quite sure of it.  I love Lirael.  I love the world.  Garth Nix is an absolute genius for coming up with this.  He completely drew me in.<br />One thing I'll comment though, as someone who reviews on amazon.com and amazon.co.uk - what is with the American covers for this series?  They are no where near as good as the covers in the UK, I can see why they'd put people off.  Don't be put off by this cover - what's inside is an utter gem.
B004PR71JC|5.0|Love the movie, love the soundtrack! One of the songs is a little different than in the movie but it's still a great soundtrack.
0060528737|5.0|This is such an amazingly brilliant series, I love it!  Really I consider this book and Liriel as one in my mind, I can't remember where Liriel ends and this begins!  One of the best series I have ever read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best series I have ever watched in my life. LOVED IT! Got hooked and then passed it on to my hubby, who thought it was silly, until the end of the first episode and then he was hooked too. LOL
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I liked this film a lot more than the book, which I thought was lack luster and didn't finish. Worth a watch if you like sci-fi and romance in one, which I think is a slightly strange combination!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a great show.  I have ordered the third season as well.  Seldom do I revist a movie or show I have already seen but this is one.
B00FATEJYE|1.0|I downloaded not knowing I didn't have enough space and now my kindle is broken won't let me delete it all I can do is add it to my damn favorites. Don't get this piece of crap
B00005JMYI|3.0|It's OK. It definitely has its moments, but overall is symbolic of Will Ferrell's career. He's either great or he's a dud. He's got the talent for 5 stars all day, but rarely cashes in on it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is so good that I could not stop reading - the story is told vividly making you imagine as being part of the plot.
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|For a movie that concentrates on a government that uses a liquid drug (the name of which sounds an awful lot like Prozac) to stifle the emotions and feelings of its citizens, Taye Diggs displays a great deal of emotional joy smiling all the way through this piece of crap. Once Christian Bale's ultimate goal became evident, I fortunately fell asleep only to awaken to the final inevitable conclusion. I couldn't turn off the tube fast enough! Did someone say &#34;Matrix?&#34; NO WAY! No wonder this is free and instant.
B006G4F8OW|5.0|I wasn't sure the first time when I was going to buy it... I thought it's going to be another crappy plastic figure. I was wrong with this one , this figure looks really nice and profissionally detalied I totally recommend it if you are looking for an Anmie figure..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The title says it all! I LOVE  IT! It's a great game for horse lovers or animal lovers! The graphics are great and never blurry. It's also very realistic.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Fun and addictive with cute graphics. Levels start off relatively easy and increase in difficulty, but even towards the end it is not that difficult. Only thing I would like to see is more challenging levels and physics
B0090SI582|5.0|It's for a grandson's Christmas Stocking and he will really love it.  It is not at all my kind of movie.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really enjoy this game,I didn't want to get it ,but after I did I found myself playing it all the time. It's a good app I got it free . And it works great on my kindle fire HD.
0804161380|3.0|Arrived in some very secure packaging from Prima themselves.  Overall it is what I expected except for a few small things:<br /><br />1. None of the bonus maps/posters/bookmarks that originally came with the Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, or Spirit Tracks guides are included.<br /><br />2. One highly usual thing is that the Twilight Princess guide is a reprint of the original one from 2006 and not the revised edition from 2007 which had 16 more pages of expanded content.  Seems like a really weird move to not have used that revised edition for this boxset.<br /><br />3. And finally, why no space for the Link Between Worlds guide?  Would have been great since that came out at the same time.
B00B1RB942|5.0|A great anime movie. An original story that is fun to watch. The voice acting is very good. Blu ray is sharp.
B00F1W1SS0|3.0|Not much to say about the performances, these musicians are masters of their instruments. Too bad they didn't hire people that are masters of their mixing boards and mastering projects. This seems to have been happening a lot lately, with RUSH and also Dream Theater, where the digital driven environment have been causing a great disservice to the **quality** of the audio productions of late.<br /><br />The mix on this production offers a sound that is thin, has no spacial depth. Part of the problem in my opinion has to do with the choice of instruments - for example, listen to the DT recordings when Rudess was still using Kurzweil keyboards instead of Korg. His sounds were more refined, 'professional' so to speak. Same goes for the drums, where everything changed. I think this is a change for the better when it comes to the drummer, Mangini is vastly superior. But his equipment is sub-par, cymbals are low quality (I wish Mike used Paiste cymbals) and his Pearl drums just don't have the same 'body' TAMA has.<br /><br />Add to that a mixing work that doesn't take into account dynamics and correct use of the frequency ranges produced by the instruments, and you get a thin-sounding, light, medium-frequency heavy mix that just doesn't translate correctly what this band is doing on stage (or in the studio recently). I don't know if the recording equipment in Argentina was appropriate or not, or if the sound has been captured wrong, but this work leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The camera work doesn't bother me much, although I have seen better. Sometimes the musician shown is not the one doing the heavy work at the moment, so some passages where it would be interesting to see \\"how in hell did he do that\\", aren't shown.<br /><br />So my conclusion is yes, it's worth it to have it in the collection. But the sound quality will leave you sad. The heaviness and Hi-Fi just isn't there anymore.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|What can you say? It's Black Sabbath...<br /><br />I do wish Bill Ward had chosen to participate, but Brad Wilk did a mighty fine job in his stead.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Very well written, the characters were three dimensional and you got to care for them. The writing was well thought out, and the cadence of the story was just right to keep you interested while at the same time not giving away all the plot twists. I can usually see through to where a story is going but this one surprised me! It was gratifying.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|The wizards of tunes strike again.<br /><br />I put it on for the first time, turned it up, leaned back a bit and listened. Before I knew it, the disc was over and I wanted more.<br /><br />That's the way an album should be.<br /><br />There's not a soul on this disc who's not in fine form. And, the rest of the band gave the reins to Don Airey on several tracks. His keyboarding skills are second to none and he shows them off.<br /><br />This is one mighty fine album.

B00GCE3TCE|5.0|Markus Zusak writes compelling books, including The Book Thief. He does so despite writing in plain, unadorned English. His dialog is conversational. Yet you know Rudy and what he's thinking, you can smell the smoke and see the cigarette hanging out of the corner of Han Huberrmann's mouth as a plays the accordion and you can see Liesel's utter focus and slight smile as she read's Max's story The Word Shaker. Not only do you intimately know the characters once you're through with one of his books, you want to know them. Even the ones that can be irritating. We care about them.<br /><br />Full review: [...]

B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I didn't have good results and found it too difficult to continue the plan on a long term basis. Not for me anyway.
B00D3ZJB1S|1.0|Ive bought and loved every single thing sabbath ever made including ozzy geezers tonys n bills solo records and works with other bands and this album is a heap of steamy dog waste.Its flat out terrible.The reasons are many...First when youre the kings of heavy rock and invented the sound everyone else has been trying to replicate for decades dont listen to one kook record producer (rick rubin) to tell u what we the fans want.I mean the real fans...the heavy duty sab fans who absolutely CANNOT accept a real sabbath record without our one and only Bill Ward behind the kit...Guess what the drums SUCK on this album without Bill.Why? Cos Bill attacks the drums like a possessed madman bashing his cymbals to death and crushing mortals heads....The new guy? A sick joke to a guy that waited over 30yrs for the new sabbath w ozzy album.Ozzy? Sounds like s***.Hes still good in the studio n his last album scream was great but rick rubin took off the echo from his voice the reberb the doubling etc n exposed ozzy as an old man<br />AND he sings in super slow motion.Sounds like hes groaning on the toilet.The mix is horrific,iommis riffs sound like monsters lumbering aimlessly around the graveyard.Theres no punch.No quick shifts in tempo.No change in pitch throughout for ozzy.The worst album EVER! PERIOD!!!\\"

B007IXWL2C|2.0|The best book out of the trilogy only because of all the psycho killers, still seems like its written by a 13 year old with a crazy sex dream.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Couldn't care less about the game or how it plays. 5 stars for a dev trying to entertain us without stealing and selling my information.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Absolutely hated this book.<br />Its not because it's a &#34;mommy porn&#34; book, but because the writing style seems like its written by a 13 year old girl with some sex dream and how she wishes her life would be someday.<br />Horribly written.<br />There are much better mommy porn books out there, I don't understand how this one got so popular.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|This is an excellent album, just like all of AJ's albums are. It's a very country album to me with a touch of bluegrass to the music, but I've heard other BG albums by other BG groups that had a much bolder BG sound to their music. Alan is a fantastic musician/singer and for me, one of the last of the artists to carry the true country sound. Some of these new people doing what they call country just aren't holding on to country music's roots, but then again, the new country audience doesn't seem to care.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|I thought it was really stupid the first few chapters but then I started to understand the book better and where the author was going.<br />It turned out to be an ok book.
B000002KB8|5.0|Excellent debut album! Part of the grass roots of heavy metal. Was not demonic in its nature. Good vocals, lyrics and instrumentation. It's hard to believe it goes back so many years. And yet, they're still part of the Rock genre.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|works well with computer<br />plug and play works well<br />recommend that you purchase the case to charge the unit<br />good sound
B002JIEYLW|5.0|I'm very biased so I like about anything that Black Sabbath puts out. Especially their early work, which this still is. Great music for metal lovers who don't care for vulgar, satanic lyrics
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Good entertainment.  Fast action, quality special effects, interesting story line.  Violence?  Yes, but not too graphic.  Just an enjoyable Bond adventure.
B004WR125O|5.0|Worked like a charm with the receiver.  Was able to stream wirelessly as advertised in the manual.  Setup was quick and easy!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Wonderful album. My only wish is that Gaga didn't preview so much of it so early. I skipped on watching a lot of her listening events and still heard around 8-9 songs due to the iTunes Festival event and the choice of singles. ARTPOP is another great endeavor from Lady Gaga and I look forward to all of her future work.

B0085MK2GM|5.0|Love this recording by glen Gould,  he always has a different interpretation of all my favorite pieces.  I am learning to play the piano..so it is great to hear my favorite artist's interpretations.  Great quality recording too.
B00GWYSQTU|4.0|&#34;Personal Breakthrough: The Ultimate Guide to Mastering Your Life&#34;<br />Great book by the author! He explains everything in very simple to understand writing. The book has a lot of wisdom that he has learned throughout the years. Read, apply, and change your life.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've been able to finish in DECADES! And it was GOOD! With a likable,nay, a lovable main character and a sweet romance that must overcome many many obstacles, including one of the greatest mysteries of the last century. The story picks you up like a rampaging river and spits you, along with the main character out, just as time does to us all.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I was amazed at this book and the ingenuity of the author. It was very exciting to see how he took the author of the James Bond stories and created a story around him in the same fashion. Brilliant. If you love James Bond then you will certainly love this book. Interesting, entertaining, and clever. You will be entertained from the beginning to the end. A very good book to read.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|We were absolutely thrilled when we found out The Piano Guys had this new album. I usually switch out CDs in the car with various holiday music or just listen to the radio, but can't seem to remove this one yet. Great MUSIC!!

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun game to pass the time.  This is one of the better hunting apps that I have tried, defiantly worth the download.
0374533571|4.0|This book is like the adult version of The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I’m not the first person to say it, but it’s true. Pat’s voice is really similar to Charlie’s except Pat’s main focus is reconciling with his wife. I really enjoyed this book and I wasn’t expecting to. Usually when movies have so much hype, I’m hesitant to read the book, but this book was surprising for me. Pat’s philosophy of seeking silver linings in the world was refreshing. A protagonist with a positive outlook in life is quite a novel idea.<br /><br />What really drew me into this book were the relationships Pat had with his parents, his friends, his brother, and with Tiffany. I also appreciated how the book didn’t shy away from depicting a man with mental health issues. Pat’s relationship with Cliff, his therapist was surprising for me (aren’t therapists supposed to keep a professional distance from their patients?) but I still really liked it.<br /><br />The whole book feels like an accurate portrayal of a man with mental health problems who is reintegrating back into his life and trying to maintain his relationships. It’s hopeful and heartbreaking and honest. I liked how flawed the characters were and how original they were too.<br /><br />And just as an FYI, the movie may be different, but it’s still incredible. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence bring the characters to life (especially Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany. Jesus, she is fearless!)<br /><br />So I recommend reading the book, then watching the movie. You’re bound to enjoy both.
B00594XOZU|5.0|At first I was a little bummed that they took so long to get the update but now that it's here it better then ever.
0812550706|5.0|Ender’s Game is a masterpiece. There’s no other way to describe it. Truth be told, I’m not a huge fan of science fiction and I was really doubtful that I would enjoy reading this novel, but this book is incredible. The writing is so intelligent, the characters are so dynamic and the plot moves at the perfect pace.<br /><br />The one thing it takes a while to get used to is the fact that all the children appear a lot older than they are. Sometimes, it is very difficult to remember that they are only six or seven years old when they’re talking like teenagers. Apparently, it’s one of the biggest criticisms of the novel. However, if you suspend disbelief at this element, what you’re left with are very interesting characters. I thought it was done purposely in order to stress the fact that they were intelligent, intellectually advanced soldiers and could never be mistaken as being simply children.<br /><br />The relationships between Ender and everyone else were also so important and so sincere. He was shown to be their leader and their commander, but not their friend. The whole book revolves around Ender’s isolation from his friends and family in order to do what had to be done. It’s so heartbreaking, but we’re forced to see the necessity of it. Consequently, there’s nobody to hate. At one point or another, you find yourself sympathizing with all of the characters.<br /><br />Even though I’m a huge fan of this book, I don’t think I will be reading any more of the series. In my eyes, the book ended perfectly and I’m completely satisfied. I will be recommending this book to all my friends. It’s emotionally complex with a lot of layers. I’m officially a huge fan of Orson Scott Card. Read this book!

B0084AXZK0|4.0|When I first read The Picture of Dorian Gray, I was in the ninth grade. At that time, this book mesmerized me. The whole book is so filled with pithy sayings and so full of quotable material that I loved it. It became my favourite book. After re-reading it, I still love it, but I see it differently. I don’t know if I can call it my favourite book anymore.<br /><br />I wasn’t mesmerized by it this time around and I really saw things that bothered me. One of the most upsetting things to me was how easily influenced Dorian was by Lord Henry. In fact, he was almost completely responsible for Dorian’s descent into evil. He was the seed of immorality that spread through Dorian, and for some reason, it really irked me. I’d always seen how corrupted Dorian became, but I focused more intensely on the cause of it during this reading. It was actually quite disappointing to me how pliant Dorian was to Lord Henry. He seemed to absorb everything and barely had a personality of his own. When his personality finally did emerge, he was so unlikable. I guess my biggest problem with this book is that once I wanted to believe the best about Dorian Gray, and now I see him as weak, easily influenced, and hopeless. Maybe that says more about how I’ve changed than the book itself. I was also less aware of the homo-eroticism in this novel than during the first reading, so perhaps I’m more mature and more cynical.<br /><br />Another thing that infuriated me were the vague references to Dorian’s sordid dealings. I can’t remember being frustrated them as a teenager, but this time I really wished there was more detail given. I mean, my imagination filled in the blanks, but it was still a little irritating that Wilde couldn’t just go there and spell it out for his audience. Maybe I’m more curious now too.<br /><br />Wilde is one of the best writers I have ever come across, I can’t deny that. However, the more I think about it, I realize this isn’t my favourite book. I felt no empathy for the characters, I felt no sadness or moral outrage. I was just a spectator. When I re-read a book, I usually see things differently in a positive light, but I didn’t with Dorian Gray. This doesn’t mean I’m not going to read more of Wilde’s works. I enjoy reading his writing immensely, and I don’t discourage anyone from reading Dorian Gray either, but I don’t think it’ll ever be on my To-Read pile again.

B002MG2ATY|1.0|JFK REVIEW<br /><br />The story was rushed, MUCH LIKE the Kennedy autopsy.<br />Not believable.<br />Too many holes in oliver Stone's version.
B009LDD5E0|4.0|I love this show and I have been collecting the seasons as they have been coming out. This season went on sale on black friday for only $13 dollars, so I jumped at the opportunity. I ordered it new, and it has been untouched, but I had to knock it down a star because it did not come with the original box protector. I am slightly obsessive and this bothers me because the rest of them came with the boxes,just not this one. BUT the discs work fine and the case is unharmed.

B00G2KV92U|2.0|Unassuming music w/out any standout songs. Mediocre at best when compared to all other albums that have been released this year. Boston's first record is my favorite album of all time so am saddened that they didn't retire before diluting their legacy.
B002NXOQF2|4.0|Richard Adams' novel Watership Down revolves around a group of everyday English rabbits who leave their warren in search of a better home. Their activities are comprised mainly of things like eating grass, raiding gardens, and running from predators.<br /><br />So what makes this story so interesting? It's this: these rabbits believe in a God, and this conviction infuses them with a sense of purpose and destiny that casts the world around them in a very interesting light.<br /><br />Not only do these rabbits believe in God, but they have a culture. There is a social hierarchy. They have an oral tradition of mythological folk lore featuring the legendary rabbit El-Ahrairah, which provides context for their place in the world and their struggles within it. They speak a distinct language from other animals; they use neologisms that don't translate into English; there is even a crude lingua franca between similar species.<br /><br />One of Adams' greatest achievements is that his rabbits never cease to be rabbits. In fact, they seem all the more rabbit-y for what they think and believe as a result of their limited understanding. For example, they can't count above the number four, so every number above four they simply call \\"five.\\" There's nothing particularly rabbitish about this, though it's exactly the kind of thing you might expect a talking rabbit to think.<br /><br />Although it's marketed as a children's book, Watership Down possesses a gravitas that will draw in readers of all ages. One of the very first scenes features a clairvoyant hare who has an apocalyptic vision of a field covered in blood. Although simple in some ways, the characters display tremendous emotional complexity as they struggle to come to grips with things like death and oppression. And there is just enough hint of the paranormal dabbled throughout the text to provide a numinous aura without indulging in the fantastic.<br /><br />The only drawback to the story is the limited scope in plot. Notthat there isn't plenty happening--there is. But there's only so much dynamic you can squeeze from a 500-page story about rabbits traversing the English countryside. It's a good read, though frequently cumbersome.  The strength of novel is in how it pulls you down to the rabbits' level in order to show our world with fresh eyes, in all its strangeness and mystery.
B00DQZQPNM|5.0|very nice product. shipped quickly. material is good quality-nice enclosure strap, good for watching movies.<br />makes my product appear bullet proof.....
034580404X|5.0|Love the book. I like the idea that I got all three in cheaper price than what it would actually cost me at bookstores.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|For special effects fans, this is definitely worth a view.  The film itself is almost entirely forgettable, but it's a fun, entertaining view -- much more so than I might have expected.  It's sort of like the Transformers meet Godzilla.  You have to go into it expecting weak characterization and plot and just enjoy the spectacle.
B00AEFXZJE|5.0|Great movie! This brings me back to my childhood in the 80's, and inspires me to re-watch several other movies from this time period. Nothing beats a good old fashioned 80's movie.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|This is a better-than-average film.  You can tell fairly easily that the production crew was trying to create something a bit different, a bit original while displaying state-of-the-art craftsmanship.  Not everything works perfectly.  There are holes in the story and incongruities, but one has a tendency to let them pass because of the scenes that do work, work tremendously well.  I was VERY skeptical going into this movie, having learned that it was an attempt to become Nolan-like serious -- and I've never considered the idea of creating a serious Superman movie as anything but an instant failure.  Is this the Superman movie we wanted or needed?  I cannot say.  But, overall, it hangs together pretty well, and the serious stuff is not overloaded (as in the Nolan Batman flicks).  In my humble opinion, a superhero movie should first and foremost be fun to watch.  I cannot recommend this to very young kids because there is a considerable amount of violence.  If your kid can handle watching NY City basically leveled then go ahead.  Now, all we can do is cross our fingers that a Superman/Batman crossover (coming up next) won't be a gigantic bomb.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wow, for a person who loves books this is an outstanding story.  Also, it helps one understand what it was like in Germany for the citizens as well as the Jews during WWII.
B000002NAK|3.0|Unlike the majority I enjoyed Madonna as Evita, and I think her vocals are quite good.  I only gave this soundtrack three stars because I don't really like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs written for this stage musical (or movie).  He can create wonders, and a lot of mediocre stuff at the same time.  Evita is like this -- pretty uneven.  The songs I like, I like a lot, and the others are entirely forgettable.
6305320802|5.0|The movie was delivered quickly, and has excellent video and audio quality.<br />You might want to be careful when removing the plastic wrapper it comes in.<br />There is actually a second, permanent plastic wrapper used as a case liner,<br />and it can be easily ripped into if your not aware and careful.<br />I'd say it might not be an issue with less than two glasses of wine.
B00G3Q6VPS|2.0|Abstract art is not exactly a concept Ms Spears was ever a proponent of, and this misguided stubbornness on her part lends her new supposedly personal work an air of abject irrelevance. Granted the artist in question was never one to transcend the pop stratosphere into a hallowed zone where only two or three human individuals have soared, but this project is at best a hollandaise sauce entirely ruined by the unfortunate addition of balsamic vinegar in the ratio of two tablespoons to one metric ton. As a `personal' work, advertised as such yet possessing none of the requisite preconditions to actually classify as one, this meandering and un-merry ride through the land of Autotunia is at best depressing and underwhelming, not to mention stripped of everything that, in basic terminology, makes music music. Drawing parallels between the artists' previous work and this one, it is evident that the downward spiral is well and truly in full force; or perhaps this is how said artist always is. In which case, the item under review is perhaps more depressing than previously thought to be. Amongst the many loosely termed musical compositions here is \\"Alien\\" where the artiste ponders on life and existentialism if she were an alien; \\"Passenger\\", where the artiste talks about being a passenger, & \\"Perfume\\", where the artiste waxes eloquent about the uses of perfume in certain situations. This is grim, dire stuff, altogether harrowing in parts. Watching an animal self combust is painful enough, but watching the long drawn out process of self slaughtering upon an axe of ones own making is something one would not wish upon unsuspecting audiences, no matter how morbid ones' tastes. As an exposition of the birth of the suicidal tendency, this is a masterclass on its own, but as an inspired work of sonic importance this is as necessary or relevant as Charlotte Bronte's lost letters to her maid Esmerelda. Avoid like the plague.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like this game. Only gave four stars because while you can play forever without purchasing anything the price of the gems is way over priced. It would be nicer if they did not cost so much.

B00BUT5I84|1.0|The one thing I can say about this band . Is that they never repeat the same style twice. 1st album was unique , 2nd was phenomenal , 3rd was emotional and dark.  Jared is a very talented person and its amazing that they don't duplicate the same loops , drum patterns or sounds . But without a shadow of a doubt I have to say this is really different but finally in a bad way. This is the blandest most uninteresting, unengaging , uninspired album they have ever done !  I hope that they get back to the darkness again and the unique production.  Its not that this album is lacking guitars because if you listen to the previous works they fuzed electronics well. This just sounds like they don't care anymore they have moved on to more important things. If this was there album 9 years ago I don't think anyone would be on this page right now. I know people will try to see good in this even justify the bands lack of creativity. But the truth is this could be any indie band at this point. I hope that this review helps people.

0345442970|5.0|Cloak of Deception fills in the blanks leading up to TPM, explaining how Gunry and Haako were allied with Sidious in the latter. We also see the origins of the blockade of Naboo. Also provides a glimpse of life on Coruscant for Jedi and politicians.<br /><br />Arwen Cohl is not a true villian, merely someone who was a pawn in a wider game. I actually felt sorry for him by the end. Boiny too.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a calculator. I don't know where the &#34;plus&#34; part comes in because it has no other function than being a basic calculator but it does exactly what it is meant to do very well, which is calculate numbers. I wouldn't actually purchase it if your phone comes with a calculator app built-in and there are also other calculator apps for the same price that do more than just simple/basic math but it was a Free App of the Day and as such I'm not disappointed. For my every-day calculations (which I actually don't need to do every-day) this is my go-to calculator because it's quick and simple and doesn't have any other functions or fancy appearance/features to get in the way. Overall I like it, but I wouldn't actually ever pay for it unless it did more.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Fun for all. Graphics great on Kindle. Can't put it down.  Takes a lot of space.<br /><br />W like to play it all night long
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that my Tablet and my phone were sync'ed once I downloaded the app. Now I can read my books I've already purchased on my phone without having to double pay.
B007EC27QM|1.0|Please tell me I did not just pay for an app that u offer for free with no obvious differences?
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Ultimate fangirl item!!!  Love it!!  Very detailed and completely awesome.  The only place to be in the zombie apocalypse is behind Daryl Dixon!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love Harry potter so much and this set was perfect for me!!!!!!!! Can't wait to sit down and watch them!!!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love this movie, and especially this cast.  It has an all time classic set of characters, and the price on Amazon was great.
B00594XOZU|4.0|The only reason you all are still comp complaining about this is that you don't check the app store. I had the same problem but now it's back on and working perfectly.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|For a free game this is too cute! When I fist saw the video on youtube I knew a game would have to come out sometime. This is a collection of mini games that relay on speed to save the little cartoons from their dumb ways to die. Very enjoyable and you get the video to keep on your device.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was my first experience reading a book by John Grisham.  It will not be the last.  This story has so many twists and turns, you begin to wonder if it will ever be resolved.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Amazing music by amazing musicians.  This is a CD you don't want to miss, along with all their other CD.  They are fabulous!
B003IDMURM|5.0|Very enjoyable.loved every story.the first one was the most funny story I have ever read. You practically live in clanton while you read these storied
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|It's a classic and I love the extras on classic movies like this. So many more details that went into this film that I knew about. Love dinos!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am so happy my child is busy playing this game on my kindle instead of watching tv and on the computer all the time
B0090SI582|5.0|So much better than the first one, at least if you're into comics. Comes with Exclusive MARVEL infinite comic, The Wolverine second screen app and Digital hd ultraviolet dvd.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I chose 1 because I can't get it to work. I tried to look for help but didn't get it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This is a great Cd by Bruno Mars..It was exactly as described...I am very pleaserd with the purchase of this item....
0525478817|5.0|This book is amazing ... a funny, heartbreaking, romance novel.  While the content is incredibly sad, I chuckled most of the way through.  It is raw, and brave enough, to tell it like it is and the characters are unique and dimensional.  I missed them when the book ended!
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|My wife loved it. But she was extremely angry when she caught me naked and tied-off in the bathroom trying inject fine powdered bits of the cd into my arm...Also the doctor at the ER wanted to express his disappoint at the album's title.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|A grim portrayal of nazi Germany. Human have immense ability to create and suffer misery. I kept turning the pages but book leaves you empty not fulfilled.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I was under the impression this was a brand new app for a new company. Then my 80 year old grandmother told me it's been around for 10 years at least, then promptly spit in my face and called me a noob. Boy I feel stupid now...
B0010HA68I|5.0|These camera straps are something I wish I would have found many years ago. They allow strapping the camera across your chest by attaching to the shoulder straps on the backpack. This allows for ready access to the camera and prevents the camera from bouncing around and falling off the shoulder when climbing over rocks or other obstacles. Perfect, perfect, perfect for hiking in rough or smooth terrain. Really worth the price!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love this movie! It's a great movie. I, myself, am not into movies like this genre, but my friend had me watch hers and I HAD to buy this movie. It's an astounding tale.
1426308469|5.0|This is an awesome book with fantastic pictures, as I expected.  The little boy I gave it too loved it!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|A good Hollywood production, the actors are professionals...but there is an overwhelming odor of propaganda<br />Not a movie to sallow hook line and sinker.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I am a glutton for punishment, ask my book club.  I am one of those kinds of people that finishes a book because I keep thinking it will get better.  This one did not.  It may make an interesting screenplay for a movie someday that will keep the audience wondering what the heck is happening, but sorry Mr. Grisham, this book fell short, was too unbelievable, and really didn't develop the characters or their relationships well enough to get what was going on.<br /><br />Readers...I suggest you look elsewhere if looking for suspense.
1611761182|5.0|Great & I follow on from Book One BUT I order the digital version by mistake & haven't got around to burning DVDs which I know is old fashioned but I find much easier when alone in the car. This is great literature because it takes you historically through the fascinating last century but with a fictional plot.
0857680986|5.0|Andrew Loomis is the acknowledged master of faces and figures for artists.  I am delighted Amazon could get this for me.  It will keep me busy for a long time.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I cannot say enough great things about this product!! Please please please, just be certain you're buying for the correct version of Kindle Fire HD that you own. My Kindle is an HD from 2012,  and it fits great, but I believe there is an HD from this year that the case will NOT fit, so read up before you buy, and you'll be fine!! The stands work great!!
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I loved the start of the book (altho I thought the post-blast scene in the museum went on too long), and although I am a reader who values writing an wordsmith-ing over plot, I felt the book bogged down and became tedious in 3 places: Las Vegas, Amsterdam in the hotel room, and the very end of the book. Those sections were a slog. Loved Hobie & Boris as characters.
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|in my opinion, I do like that they try different genre's/styles. it shows a willingness to explore, and not just adapt to what their comfortable with. they do have tracks in this album that just screams old Linkin Park, and that's fine too. actually, this sounds more like meteora than minutes to midnight or  a thousand suns. while it still has that same cohesion of from track to track, the transition isn't as smooth as, say, those last 2 albums.<br /><br />still worth a listen if you've ever liked their music.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|ever the wrong thing?  This movie will give you a lot to think about when it is over and not many movies can do that these days. The cast was perfectly chosen and the writing deserved more than the five stars I could give the movie.  I am thrilled I bought the dvd and the free online rental was icing on the cake.  This movie is not one that will be easily forgotten.  It is one that you will want to watch many times and share.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I could not put this story down, amazing, fun. Cannot wait for the next book.  I was completely immersed in the story of these wonderful, peculiar children.
0321544080|1.0|1.  Just to clarify the obvious, this is a book review and not a review of Joe McNally the photographer nor of his body of work, which is extensive and celebrated.  In terms of the content of the book, I should have known that with Scott Kelby's tendency to exaggerate and the seeming nepotism and narcissism that seems to exist at Kelby Media Group (it's just my intuition…and by the way, they do provide an overall good service to the photographic community, I purchase many of their books, I view their video tutorials etc…), that I shouldn't have gotten my hopes too high for this supposedly awesome book on the life and times of Joe McNally the the stories behind his images.  The reality is that this book isn't bad, but it's certainly far from being great.  Frankly, it's kind of boring.  Yea, there are various factual type back stories of how the author captured various images, but where are the great insights?  Actually forget the great insights, how about some emotional content, how about some insights into the person of Joe McNally?  As I write this, I can't believe that this is the same author whom Kelby pumps up as being a masterful story teller.  Really?  Definitely an accomplished photographer, but a writer?  I don't get it.<br /><br />2.  I know that I'm going against the grain here, but please, don't follow what the crowd tells you to think or believe;  judge the content on it's own merit and one does that, this book is one can easily pass by… especially at this price.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|An endless, testing-of-time challenge, that has become one of my children's most enjoyed games to play over and over again.
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|It has some funny moments and the cast works well together, but excessively, unnecessarily over-the-top crude.  Sorry, but this is a miss.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am obsessed with this game you don't even know. I love it soooooooooooo much. If you don't have this you need it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BJ7G1VK|5.0|Lots of awesome recipes!  The recipes seem simple with great photos and directions.  I'm glad I added this book to my recipe collection.
0515153656|2.0|if I had read this one first, I would not have read another. Thank goodness he got better. There was a crudeness to his descriptions<br />that were unnecessary in many instances and disgusting. Glad that I read many of his later books first before I got to this one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I don't need all the extras that Roku offers, especially the music channels (I have a Sonos for that). Most of my online TV/Movie watching is Netflix and HBO Go, so this works great.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I was challenging to get to hit at the right place.  If you want to just relax and think about other things than problems, it serves the purpose.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|A superb CD! Already my favorite of the many Avenged 7-fold albums.I simply love it! It may be the most technically precise sounding cd I have ever heard, with a fantastic old-school metal feel. Also the production and sound levels are far superior to any other cd I have listened to in many years. Blended into the sound with a subtle perfection were such exotic and typically non-metal instruments as the Bass trombone, Cello, and Trumpet to name but a few. This takes nothing away from the over all metal vibe, but only adds to it's majestic element. I felt that perhaps the only drawback to it(if there are any) were the two ballads tracks(having lived through metal's dark days of the Glam-metal acts of the 80's I still cringe at the thought), but after having listened to the album for over a month now, even these have grown on me quite a bit. A must have for any fan of metal and then some. Highly recommended!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is a story that had to be told.  This is a book that should be read in all English classes in the US.  After students read this book I hope one thing that they take away is what an education means too them and the freedoms they can practice with out fear.  Hopefully this book would give them a different perspective of their country.  An interesting fast moving book easy to read.  A must read book.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|this app was perfect for my kindle. its simple interface made it even easier to clear vary useless memory and purge apps.
1612931103|5.0|This book was for one of my classes and really like, good book and a good price. I am happy with my product
0062255657|2.0|I wisely decided to get this one from the library rather than shell out nearly 18 bucks for the Kindle version.  Neil Gaiman is quoted as saying this tale started its career as a short story and just grew.  But it shouldn't have been allowed to.  Or more time and effort should have been put into the development of a true novel.<br /><br />This fiction is in the horror genre of Stephen King's vast output of hack work done in later years, apparently against his publisher's sound advice but printed anyway in the all too familiar &#34;what the hell, let's just make some money here&#34;.  That's what we have with &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&#34;.  Cardboard characters with all the interesting attributes of a dead sponge swanning around in an underdeveloped plot peopled with laughable 'horrors'.<br /><br />Gaiman is a good writer and I enjoy his work, just not this time.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Good easy fast paced combat...i like it. I love the combat system and the graphics are spectacular. Its an all around great game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!  Very addicting!  However I have completed all the current levels!  It says more levels are coming so I'd like to know when they might be coming?!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|It's a lot sillier than Scalzi's usual fare, but the silly works and there are some moments of gut-wrenching reality as well.
034580404X|5.0|Loved the Book ! I was hesitant to read it by jumping on the bandwagon with everyone else, but once I started reading it, I realized what the whole buzz was about and ended up reading the entire trilogy. Very sexual, enticing, thrilling, emotional all in one and I really enjoyed it. I just hope the  movie version isn't disappointing.
1933952806|5.0|I found Darrell Young's book on the D90 to be very helpful. So when I got the D7000 I bought his book on this camera. With the D90 book, I unlocked many options that I had missed in three years of shooting. But now, with my D7000, I'll get that capability right from the start.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|C'mon it's Michael Jackson already ! There are no additives or substitutions out there that can replace him ! Enough said...
B00992CF6W|5.0|How can you not like Minecraft?!?  Now my son never has to stop playing this game.  Seriously, he won't stop.  I need to pry the tablet out of hands to get him to go to bed at night.<br /><br />That being said, the pocket edition lacks some functionality of the PC version but he doesn't seem to mind.  Worth the money and makes a great gift!
0062103377|5.0|I found this book soooo cool! Love the Bobby Singer character and this book gave an interesting insight from his point of view. Some parts I laughed out loud and other parts were just creepy (in a good way) Would reccommend this book to any Supernatural fan!
1451648537|5.0|The story of Steve Jobs seems to perfect to be true.  Who else has a life that falls perfectly into three acts – the initial accent, the fall, and finally the return and reaching new heights?  Isaacson is up to the task of juggling a history,  a biography, and an MBA case study – it is quite a feat.<br /><br />Steve Jobs is also the perfect antihero.  Jobs was peerless in his cultivation and use of power.  By Chuck Klosterman’s definition, Jobs was evil.  His decisions appear to have been guided by a keen sense people, but without concern for people.  Isaacson only used the term psychopath once and even then he uses an ex-girlfriend to make the claim.  Isaacson writes:<br /><br />He was very emotionally attuned, able to read people and know their psychological strengths and vulnerabilities.  He could stun an unsuspecting victim with an emotional towel-snap, perfectly aimed.  He intuitively knew when someone was faking it or truly knew something.  “It’s a common trait in people who are charismatic and know how to manipulate people.  Knowing that he can crush you makes you feel weakened and eager for his approval, so then he can elevate you and put you on a pedestal and own you.”<br />Jobs’ quest for power extended beyond personal relationships into how he conducted business.  Jobs also had innate sense for when power was more important than profit.  As Isaacson notes, Job’s design philosophy required control – the user never really own the user experience, but always just a guest in Job’s house.<br /><br />The lesson Jobs learned over and over is that loyal customers are the ultimate power base.  He gained power when he fascinated the customer with the blue phone box, the Apple II, Pixar Movies, and the iPhone.  Jobs’ power eroded when projects flopped.  Dwindling Mac sales lead to his ouster from Apple.  NeXT computer bled his resources.<br /><br />There is a danger in trying to emulate Jobs.  Not only was his personal style caustic, his business success is of the nature that eludes imitation.  Jobs has an intuitive sense of what customers wanted from their consumer electronics.  He only needed to test prototypes against his own intuition.<br /><br />Developing that type of intuition is costly – Jobs made costly mistakes.  A more modern, a less risky, approach to product development is to test early and fail cheap.  Don’t emulate Jobs, be a Growth Hacker.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Saw this movie at the theater and knew when it became available at a good price I would buy it
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This should become a classic.  Characters were so real.  I cried, laughed, mourned and celebrated with them.  I did not want this story to end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Absolutely love the size of the numbers! Don't always have to depend on my specs to see the buttons! Thank you for that!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|The puzzles are all very similar (nearly all hidden object) .  I would have liked some variety.  The artwork is very attractive, though.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Absolutely the BEST Worship CD...ever! Our church worship team learned Victor's Crown for Easter Sunday.  I decided to find the CD with that song.  Revealing Jesus is an awesome worship experience.  The DVD that is included is fantastic! Just like being there. I can't put into words how great this CD/ DVD combo is. There are several songs that our team has included in our worship lists. I highly recommend.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Despite some plot holes one could drive a starship through, the latest Star Trek installation is just as enjoyable as the previous. My major complaint is that the casting of Khan was not the least bit true to the original TOS casting choice, which distracted me from the content. Cumberbatch was quite vanilla, unemotional, and bland, in comparison to Ricardo Montalban's passionate and intense original Khan - this made me very sad and disappointed as a lifelong Trek fan.<br /><br />Other than that MAJOR casting flaw, I really enjoyed so much about this film. It's wonderful to see Trek finally show that humanity is still far from perfect, and that Trek can be full of awesome adventure.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use this on all my devices.
B00DQZQQN6|3.0|This case is ok, BUT...I agree with other reviewers it isn't very good for reading.  You simply cannot fold back the case and hold it comfortably.  I bought this as a gift for someone, and knowing they will use their device mostly for reading, it will be returned.  On the plus side it fits well, seems protective, and is nicely adjustable for viewing videos.  It's also very stylish and well priced.  Unfortunately these things don't make up for the fact that it can't be folded back nicely.  I wish I had listened to the other reviews and chosen a different case.
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|This might be Rush's best live recording to date & this is coming from someone who didn't think they could top \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" but the more I listen to these three CDs, the more I'm becoming convinced.<br /><br />Listening to \\"Middletown Dreams\\" as I type & I scratch my head as to why I ever had doubts about Rush playing some of the lesser known tracks from \\"Power Windows.\\" \\"Dreams\\", \\"Grand Designs\\", and \\"Territories\\" all rocked and the rarely played gem \\"The Body Electric\\" is quickly becoming one of my favorite live tracks.<br /><br />The new material from \\"Clockwork Angels\\" gets better with each new listen, particular standouts for me are \\"The Wreckers\\", \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" and \\"Wish Them Well\\". The string accompaniment the band employed on this tour was a definite success in my book.<br /><br />And I really enjoyed the strings on some of the old classics like \\"Red Sector A\\" and \\"YYZ\\". I don't know if I would say it was the best renditions of those songs, but it's very close to the top for me.<br /><br />Overall, if you love Rush then this 3 CD set should be very much to your liking.<br />5 stars
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Got it for free on a cyber monday sale. I don't spend enough time playing games to warrant spending money on them, so it was nice to find for free!<br /><br />(Great game though, and if i did spend a lot of time playing games, this would be one that I would spend money on as well.)<br /><br />game seems to be about 60% strategy, 40% blind luck. This means it is fun to figure out the best way to bust up those piggies, but it also is beatable enough that you won't get TOO frustrated when you get stuck.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I read this for a book club and was not expecting much (though I am a Malala fan). I thought it might be simplistic or too watered down by trying to appeal to such a diverse swath of people. But it was fascinating. I feel like I not only know Malala better, I know Pakistan better.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|This is fun but hard to do. Have to break down the wall but the King Oddball does not let you. I recommend this to those who love to knock down walls to go ahead in the game.
B006QQQ5SI|4.0|Love the movie, don't like the extended version.  I love John Cleese, but having watched both the extended version and the &#34;regular&#34; edition of the movie, I prefer Jack Black's narration.  The biggest difference between the two is the voice over.  There are a few additional cut away scenes of birds, but nothing that has any bearing on the story itself.  If you are on the fence between the two my personal recommendation is the regular ed. but to each their own.<br /><br />The movie itself centers around Black, Martin, and Owens who are all birders and their objective is to see as many birds as possible from January 1 to December 31 to attain the title of the worlds greatest birder.  Owens currently holds the title and is looking to ensure that it holds, or that if competition is serious enough that he beats his own record at any cost to maintain his title.  The story centers around the lives and adventures of these three as they jump back and forth across the country trying to add to their count.  Being the best requires sacrifice and dedication... sometimes winning may not be worth the cost.<br /><br />While the subject matter (birding) is far outside what I consider to be the normal scope of movies that I seek out, the cast, the soundtrack, the story, and the beautiful visuals really do make this a movie that we watch regularly.  It's definitely kid safe which is nice to find.  It can be hard to find movies the entire family can not only tolerate but actually enjoy.  This is one of them!
B00F56AZK4|1.0|There are only two puzzles to actually work. The others have to be paid for. The puzzles are all together and not easy to move or to use. This is the worse puzzle I have ever seen. I rated it a one but it should have been a zero in my estimation.Save your time and do not even try to use this puzzle. There is another puzzle that is really great. The puzzle pieces in that one are larger to see.
B000I3PERS|5.0|It is one of the greatest movies ever made to show compassion, ethical and moral standards, what love is all about and what a person can accomplish by following what they believe in and their heart.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am very aware that this book has sold a gazillion copies and they are making a movie, but I just couldn't get into it. Perhaps it is for some people, but I found it rather choppy, and I found it didn't flow smoothly. Sorry, I did give it a serious try.
B00GIZO674|5.0|Ive played this game many times over the years and love it. I was really excited to see it available for my kindle.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I have bought 3 hard copies over the years of which I currently possess none. I keep giving this book away. I think I have read it at least half a dozen times, and it remains one of my best books of the craft of writing. The problem with reading Steven King is you become spoiled by good writing. When you turn to another author you immediately notice the difference, and not in a good way. I consider Steven to be one of the Masters of the craft, though he would deny it himself, and despite his close brush with death during the writing of this, he did an amazing job and gives a tremendous insight into how he goes about crafting a story. I could not recommend this book enough.
B002VUFKG6|1.0|This book and the one before (30 Days) should have been combined into one book and edited.  Storyline was interesting, but too much description of things that weren't interesting. I didn't really care about the characters.  The ex husband was not as menacing as I thought he would have been
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A fun read that is clearly Tina's voice. It's worth the investment for sharing her view about life and our fellow humans.
B00783NWB6|4.0|A good 3D movie and a good buy if you own a 3D t.v.  Worth owning even if you already own non-3D version.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie. Great price. I watched this movie numerous times on long plane flights. Darker than the first, but still action packed. They are slowly explaining relationships for a series that ended 20+ years ago. And I am interested.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Like the series and this season was a good follow up to the first.  all seasons are worth watching on Amazon.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Font size too small. I can barely read the captions. Very disappointing when I have to strain to read what people say.
B00B4804KS|5.0|A top 3D movie.  One of the best 3D movies I've ever seen.  Even though it was not originally made in 3D, it's great.
B00GHLZYVG|3.0|Five stars for the vocals, three stars for the recording and studio work, two stars for the material. The material all sounds the same. What could this singer do with some of the classics?
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Definitely a must have for all Star Wars fans.  All the extra features are great and I can't wait until Ep. VII.  Get this set.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game yet on kindle fire  Doesn't get boring  So much fun Awesome love it so much game to kill time
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Blu-ray is better for HD quality, of course.  However, with regard to the movie, it's the best movie in the trilogy. If you can, get the Blu-ray instead and make sure you see the trilogy in order.  Better that way.
B001EYU1VO|4.0|Its an awesome stick to fly with, I even connected it to my RC quad copter via my laptop and wireless router.  As for being used as a stick for games such as Hawken or Mech Warrior, it's not a good stick for that due to it being too sensitive.  Other than that, great product, great flight sim stick,  made well and plenty of buttons that can be assigned after some reading of the directions.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Many areas I had to buy because it never added it through friend help.<br />This is on kindle fire hd version.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|GREAT APP!  Very useful for quick access to the bible whenever you need it--highly recommended to anyone looking for a great bible app.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Yes, a nice puzzle game, authentic and relaxing.<br /> No substantial permissions- even though it does need internet access which was not flagged at installation, that must be for the licensing.<br />  Nice file size and playable/stable in Galaxy SII- keeper. Thanks for throwing us a bone dev and Amazon!
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Bill Bryson! The name says it all. You can hardly wait to take trip with him. He combines the experience with the history of the place that brings it alive.  This is not a tourist trip to Australia, this is the real thing.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|So why do I give this 1 star? There are only 4 app that work with Chromcast. So unless you already pay for HBO, Hulu+, and/or Netflix, you will only have Youtube for free. It is easy to hook up and thats about it. To control it, you must use your phone or tablet with the Chromecast app. This isn't much of an issue unless your phone needs off because you forgot to charge it.<br />I am very disappointed mostly with google since they have not allowed other apps to work with it. I would love to use my ABC app to watch Castle but that is not possible. It seems that the low price comes with very little options unless you are willing to pay a subscription. I am very disappointed. I should have spent the $30 to purchase the Roku 3 for $100 on Amazon and would have been able to stream Amazon Prime videos. By the way, I really like Google devices. I own a Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 and enjoy them greatly; however, I am very dissapointed with Chromecast. Don't buy Chromecast unless you have HBO, Hulu+, Netflix and don't care to do anything else. Save your money and buy another device.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I have to say this is one of the funnier animated films I have seen since Despicable Me.  We saw it in the theater twice which is something we never do.  So great to have a food Halloween movie!
B0000DJZ8R|1.0|This DVD didn't contain some  scenes from the original movie. The ffght scene where  Henry Fonda killed a man and was sent to prison was eliminated. Please send me the original version of The Grapes of Wrath. Thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is super addicting. I love that I can include my friends and ask for upgrades on facebook. I can not stop playing.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|it kept my Grandson happy and he liked it. if it wasn't good he would have just left it alone and gone on to something else.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Another book chosen for book club that I wouldn't have otherwise read. So pleased to have done so. Highly recommend it to one and all.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book keeps you riveted till the very end.  It seemed to start slow but then you get sucked in and then ending is mind-blowing.  A must read!

B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Love the Killers. This is a great DVD to own. They don't have too many to begin with. The quality is great.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|No use of it. It was a surprise for me that android version of chrome don't support chromecast. The only app on android that supports chromecast and that I am using is Youtube. But Youtube app can cast video to my TV without chromecast. I don't need to cast from my PC, but i experimented with it, and it has serious lags when casting from chrome in 720p.
B000KIPT30|5.0|i use this for my (home) recording studio and also to listen to movies via my bose surround sound. easy to move form room to room but the best thing about this amazon purchase is the price. so low i cant believe it. they were like 25 bucks. great deal and great sound.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Very happy with this unit!<br />I am not a technical person and was concerned about being able to use the product without a lot of frustration.<br />Fortunately, the operating manual and the unit itself are both user friendly.<br />My slides are encased in cardboard and they easily fit into the scanner.<br />With just a few clicks it is saved to the sandisk and I am onto the next slide.<br />What a great winter project!<br />I took a chance on a brand I had never heard of and I am glad I did!<br />Thank you DB Tech!
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen king, awesome book, really had a hard time putting it down. The first movie with Jack Nicholson really follows this book closely
B000E9910W|3.0|Not sure why I bought this CD, because I had most of the hit songs from an earlier released CD. I like the Doobies, but not quite this much. Oh well , it isn't a bad CD if your a big fan.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works as advertised. Does what I was doing manually much, much more efficiently and then some.. keeps the kindle fire hd from getting sluggish.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Having a degree in Art History always draws me into stories about art and artists, so I grabbed The Goldfinch off the shelf in anticipation of the seven hundred plus pages of pleasure to come.  I'm sorry to say I have to agree with the other readers who felt it was in dire need of editing.  It's not that Ms. Tartt's writing isn't excellent, but her narrative is so protracted and detailed that she loses the emotional impact for her characters.  I'm a patient reader, but this book was a trial. Halfway through I no longer cared and I was skim reading through the last third of the book to come to an end point that could have been conveyed on the back jacket of a paperback self help book.<br /><br />Dear Ms. Tartt's editors: Just say nooooo.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Who could not like facebook on a tablet - it is great and very quick to load.  I  like it especially for my game scores and palying partners.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love this movie and so does my child. She watches it almost every night. This is a great buy as a gift. Its a great family movie.
B0033B5XCS|4.0|Good collection! Very good quality as well. A big fan of Wes Craven and Freddy Kruger! If you like the the first nightmare on elm street take a look at this collection. Although I wasn't that impressed with the last movie (freddy vs. jason) I give that one a thumbs down but the set is still worth it. 7 out of 8 movies not bad!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It's a very entertaining game I am completely addicted I recommend injustice gods among us to everyone one of the best mobile games I have ever played
1451695195|4.0|The description says this book will change your life.  Not even close.  It was an interesting book and remarkable that this dr had this experience.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|This story was fantastic, it really challenged my way of thinking, and caused me to realise a few things about myself. I bought the book because I had read A Fault in Our Stars, and I assumed that if that book was so good, this one must be too. (a horrible philosophy, but oh well.) I am quite glad that I bought it, good on me. And good on you, Mr. John Green. Thank you for -yet again- a Wonderful story.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|It's a very nice movie although it will bring the tears on.  AnnaSophia does an excellent job portraying Bethany Hamilton.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you made it through the first one. READ THIS ONE! This is the best book out of all 3
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|This is a good and solid dance/pop album. As my previous review of Femme Fatale noted: Britney music is simply fun. She doesn't let us down here as some were anticipating a massive flop. It is not! The album strikes a balance between Dance and Ballads. Most of the dance tracks are great - not quite the level of Hold It Against Me or Dance Till The World Ends but they will be fun in the club, to workout, etc. The slowed down poppy ballads are surprisingly good. About half of the album goes for a more minimalistic vibe instead of the nonstop dance party that was her last album. Britney sounds more awake, present and involved than any of her work in recent memory. Her vocals are more highlighted in this album than the past 3-4 albums.<br />The only song I'm not much fond of is the sort of &#34;rock&#34;  Passengers. The song with her sister is surprisingly good, much better than I would expect.<br /><br />Overall Britney Jean is a sort of mash-up of Britney's entire career to date. It hits those poppy bittersweet notes of her early years and include the heavy club-banging songs of her later years. I wouldn't say it was a blackout 2.0 nor as personal as it was hyped up to be, it just doesn't inspire that kind of hip-hop dance feel as much to fit the bill of Blackout and is it personal? I guess for a B-Spears album its personal though the lyrics certainly aren't anything profound.<br /><br />But Britney Jean is FUN and catchy and overall good and pleasant to the ear. In a year of some fairly week pop music B-Spears proves she can still put out yet another solid pop album. If you're looking for anything waxing poetic and profound you will be disappointed.<br /><br />As a final note, the Deluxe Edition features some surprisingly good songs and they aren't throwaways like they were on previous albums. Go for the Deluxe Edition.
B0000549B0|4.0|Always one of my favorite books and films in the comedy category. Best scene was what's his name looking in the dictionary for the term Pooka.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on Kindle.  I have all but abandoned my PS3 lately!  I'm simply addicted to this game via my girlfriend's kindle fire.  She also loves this game and can hardly wait until I get my -OWN- Kindle!!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Thank you for your smoothly delivery. This one is so palatable headset . Logitech's headset sound quality is best. Thank you for your best price . Unfortunately we have a lot of tax in our country. This headset price is nearly USD 346 in my country hence I choose Amazon and it was right choice.
B00BESM14U|5.0|love this movie, they did a fantastic job with the casting, i just wish that they included everything from the book. and they left out a lot of his letters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Never cried so much reading!!! I loved it. Love your writing style. Keep them coming.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I paid for the full version , and am now stuck in the little girls room as can not click on the LaSt object needed to complete the HO puzzle in order to progress as it is hidden behind the &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; button on my screen, so every time I try to click on it it takes me outta of the puzzle screen. PLEASE FIX or REFUND what I paid for this game.
B00B10HAO2|3.0|Parts of this movie are terrific and others not so much. For Helen Mirren's performance as the long suffering wife of Alfred Hitchcock, it's worth seeing. Scarlett Johansson is also solid as Janet Leigh. On the other hand Anthony Hopkins is fine as Hitch but the choice of having these dream sequences where he talks to the murderer Ed Gein (upon whom the Tony Perkins character in Psycho) is based on was just plain awkward. Jessica Biel's talents are completely wasted in such an insignificant part as the put-upon Vera Miles. That added almost nothing to the story despite some attempt to link Hitch's weird behavior towards her somewhat to his odd obsession with icy blondes.<br /><br />The look and feel of the Hollywood movie sets, backlot as well as the Southern California coast at that time was pretty cool. The wheeling and dealing to get the funding and also to avoid the censors was most likely pretty eyeopening to people born today and not yesterday.<br /><br />The extras are zip. All I had on the DVD I saw was a bunch of trailers. For that alone it's a pretty mediocre DVD package when there's so much food for fodder with Hitchcock.
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|so I preordered back in September, finally got it, open it up to inspect and inside, there's no Season three, and two Season Fours.  Amazon Returns tells me they'll ship out a replacement, so I send it back.  Shortly after I'm notified it's not available, tough luck.  Oh, but they can give me 39.99 to order Season Three.  ##%$ what do I need that for when I sent it all back.  A follow up from Customer service tells me he doesn't want to see me in more trouble, but I can check from other sellers and Amazon International?!?  No way and I paying $600 for it from a price gouger or ordering a German language version.  Thanks for nothing
B00GMR5L40|4.0|The Way We Were is a heartbreaking love story about a couple with very different beliefs and political convictions. This is a Twilight Time limited edition of 3000 units. The audio quality is great and the picture quality is terrific. There is 62 minutes of total bonus content. All of the 1999 DVD supplements have been ported over except for some Streisand trailers and text-based cast and crew info. The new audio commentary with two film historians is good but somewhat repetitive.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround<br />Supplements: 2 Audio Commentaries, Documentary, Isolated Music Track, Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.
0316055433|4.0|The Goldfinch is a page turner, with an interesting story to tell and compelling characters.  But in the final 7%, the author veers away from the narrative to give each main character a chance to pontificate on weighty matters of life, death, loss, and oh, art.  So rather than the actions and motives of the characters stirring us to our own philosophical musings, we have an overblown version of &#34;what it all means&#34; spelled out in evangelical tones.  I cared for the characters, and the story provided some urgent late night reading, but when all was said and done, I was strangely unmoved by the book.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a very well done documentary.  I would recommend it for everyone!  It is eye opening to see where our food in this country comes from and I have changed my buying habits as a result.  Not just for the cruel way the animals we eat are treated but for the health aspects.  Who wants to eat meat full of stress hormones like cortisol and full of steroids and antibiotics??? Not me and definitely not my kids!<br />They also have a very nice piece about a farmer in the midwest who is farming the old fashioned way.  Animals are treated humanely and slaughtered humanely.  I showed my 4 year old this piece of the video after he spent time with his dad's vegetarian gf and didn't want to eat chicken.  After seeing it and explaining how it works to him he's had no issues.  Overall a great film!
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|Everyone. It is as fair and balanced as it could be without the participation of SeaWorld, who chose not to participate. It is an eye-opener for anyone who thinks what SeaWorld does is OK.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I rented this movie. After watching it once, I knew I had to order it. It such a great story about a quiet and shy guy who meets two lively peers in high school. You can practically find a little of everything on Amazon. I check the stores prices and Amazon always has it for less.
0761163808|2.0|Photos very poor quality. They were so blurry that I kept trying to move the book to a different angle to get a clearer image. I gave this 2 stars because of the good info on each animal.  If not for that, I would have given it 1 star.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Good but not Great. Another reviewer said it very well. The best thing was that I really cared about the characters which is important for me. It was just too long. Almost missed the big reveal about Pippa!  In some ways the book was more about addiction and anything else. The price was right. I'm not I'm unhappy I read it but I would only recommend it to people who are willing to persevere through 800 pages
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is readily available and I can move from book to book, and all over the Bible with just a click.  I have not found a flaw yet not that I am looking for one
B006M4F67A|4.0|Should label the icons for 'go back' and 'scramble tiles,' etc. Made it difficult to improve the speed for solving.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Most levels are ok. Some are more fun than others. What I like most about the game is the strategy aspect. What I hate most is those levels that are 100% luck and take forever to pass, like 266 or 417. Both are horrendous levels that almost made me quit altogether.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I could also use the word sublime!  Don't miss this Christmas recording!  One of my favorite versions of Carole of the Bells ever. I can listen to it over and over and I hear new things every time. I particularly love how they love their music. It comes through loud and clear.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|super addicting, the only thing bad I could say is the never ending-ness and how hard it can be sometimes, but that's all part of the fun!
0385720920|5.0|Classic! One of Chuck's best novels handsdown. Shipping was quick and painless. I look forward to indulging in more of his works in the future.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I love this app! With a busy life, it can be hard to find a clean notebook. With this I can find my notes easier!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game rocks best game on the market totally worth it. Download this game right now.<br />You can get so much cool stuff for the console version on this as well.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Priced a bit high, but great product. I was nit excited about the shipping cost. Other than those peeves I am glad I found the set with Amazon.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I needed a second controller for my PS3 and I bought this one so I could have another player on my game. It worked out fine and is a real good controller.
006097625X|4.0|Required for class.  I'm not really into comics, but I did grow up on MAD magazine.  BUT, this book is an excellent format for introducing graphics arts for just about anything you want to do.  It's definitely a different approach but it has a flow to it and it is really helpful for all sorts of new ways to present your work.
B00EDPFJA4|1.0|The Music in the CD was awesome but it came as a copied disc; not the actual disc as I was led to believe. Very misleading vendor even though I loved the actual music.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I was worried I wouldn't like this Cd. I have her other stuff but some of her songs are hit and miss with me. This album is full of energy and ... Surprisingly good. Love her voice.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Great movie and put me back in my childhood in viewing it. The movie arrived faster than I thought and was of good quality. Highly recommended!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Excellent movie, great acting! It is a great movie even for someone who does not usually enjoy this type of movie
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I bought this for a gift and it came exactly as it was supposed to. I didn't pay the original price for it and got it on a discount. Great for any star wars/ darth maul fan.
B0055S348W|5.0|I really love this app! I can print from  my kindle fire hd now, as it  is my only computer right now.  We had a tree get struck by lightening in July which killed my computer as well as our tv and some other electronics.  I purchased a kindlebecause I'd been thinking about an e reader for some  time.  I am thrilled with Print Share because it does everything I want it too, and it is very easy to use. I would recommend this app to anyone!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really like this game!
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|I love Barbara and the cd was received without damages, it has started my holiday off to a great start.
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|I love Sofia! Aaaaand so does my daughter, which is why I bought her this. The funniest thing was while I was looking up my orders on Amazon, she saw this and started hollering, &#34;Mom! I want that!!!!! Get it for me!!!&#34; (a bit spoiled, yes.) Good sized dolls, and they look wonderful.
0061950726|5.0|Beautifully written and a must read for serious historians and literature advocates.  I mentioned this book to a friend and her grandmother was one of the &#34;train riders&#34;.  Many of these children endured a type of slavery that has been overlooked in modern history as have those who came to this country as indentured servants.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|While the packaging is worded &#34;Send video or anything on the Web to your TV from your smartphone, tablet or laptop&#34; the truth is you can not stream any video from your smartphone.  This is simply a lie, and what's worse, I am a die hard android fan and would rather have AppleTV than Chromecast.  This device does not send the video on my Smartphone through my Chromecast to my TV, period.<br /><br />This device should have allowed for screen sharing but Google dropped that ball, now I must repackage and return this paper weight.  I have a Google TV and wanted to try a Chromecast, you can only stream what you bought through Google Play?  This is a joke and I will be getting a second Google TV because Chromecast is worthless in today's market, and they wonder why no apps are being developed for it? EPIC FAIL
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I have visited Portofino and the concert from the DVD was one I saw on Public TV--it is breathtaking.  I have been a fan of Andrea Bocelli for a long time.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|It was very helpful to me I like it and it allows me to go through pictures or on the web to snap I think it's great overall
B004LM72ZY|5.0|Our 2 year old LOVES this rocket ship! It's high quality and perfect for the airplane trip and giving him something new to be distracted with in a new area.

B0002O7XW2|4.0|CHRISTINE is a Stephen King novel based John Carpenter flick about an eerie, twisted love story of a teenager and his obsessively jealous 1958 Plymouth Fury --- as only Stephen King can tell it! Christine is a red and white 1958 Plymouth Fury who seduces 17-year-old Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon).<br /><br />She demands his complete and unquestioned devotion and when outsiders seek to interfere, they become the victims of Christine's horrifying wrath. This special edition DVD is packed with added features.<br /><br />As Arnie begins to restore the evil Christine to her original beauty, Christine only played old songs from the 1950's Rock & Roll music expressing its feelings towards Arnie & anybody who tampered with her, especially after the car expresses to Arnie that his feelings of admiration for Christine are requited causing Arnie to have a change in behavior & personality bringing out his dark side when he starts spending most of his time with the car.<br /><br />In addition to that, King's novel which was the source for Carpenter's film clearly indicated that the car was possessed by the evil spirit of it's previous owner Roland LeBay showing that the evil spirit surrounding the car was already present the day it was built at the car factory in Detroit along with the fact that Carpenter had decided to make a car the killer & the villain in CHRISTINE instead of having serial killers or mass murderers being the villains like Carpenter did with his horror flicks HALLOWEEN in the Fall of 1978 and THE FOG in the Winter of 1980.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, Carpenter even explains in this DVD's bonus feature how reading King's story of CHRISTINE inspired him to direct this movie, especially since his previous flick THE THING did so poorly at the box office when it was theatrically released in the Summer of 1982.<br /><br />Although Christine was identified as a 1958 Plymouth Fury, they also used 2 other Plymouth models like the Belvedere & the Savoy to portray the malevolent automobile onscreen kind of like how they used 4 Pontiac Trans Ams to run the show on KNIGHT RIDER during its 1982-86 run on NBC and like the producers did with the General Lee on THE DUKES OF HAZZARD during its 1979-85 run on CBS, especially since the '58 Fury's were expensive to buy at the time costing the producers of CHRISTINE a total production of $5,303 bucks.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon was originally offered the role of Arnie Cunningham, but he declined it to do a screen test for the movie FOOTLOOSE, which was a risky move for Bacon at the time, but ended up paying off at the end since FOOTLOOSE was a major success at the box office when it was released in the Winter of 1984.<br /><br />CHRISTINE amassed $3,408,904 landing at #4 during its opening weekend release back in the Fall of 1983 bringing in a total gross of $21,017,849 at the box office. This thriller also had a returning co-star from a previous John Carpenter film too which was Harry Dean Stanton(Det. Rudolph Junkins)which played Brain in ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK which was theatrically releases in the Summer of 1981.<br /><br />This thriller also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 11 years old in the 5th grade living in my hometown(El Centro,CA)at the time.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|If Amazon had a thousand stars available..I'd give every one to Martin and his four volume 'Game of Thrones'.  I loved every volume and still spend time wondering about the outcome for Westeros. I look forward to Book Five, but really can't imagine  why.  My versions of the outcomes have to be more positive than his will be.  My romantic self would never allow the mayhem to be so real as it is in Martin's version of life in the midst of constant battle.  I need his writing as a reminder of just how fortunate I am to live in a world where old people survive and only children in their classrooms are killed by sociopaths.  I'm an 'oldie'...and a fan of Martin's mind.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is loads of fun but the adds are extremely annoying other than that I love playing this game
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|The book was riveting from the beginning and tinged with unjust things that occurred in the South during those awful years. Although fiction it could easily be a true story of the hideous past.
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed these books very much. I especially enjoyed his version and thoughts at the end of the story. Looking forward to you next addition of Fifty.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm just start reading, but I was grabbed by the history and the characteres.Yes I can say that I recommend this book
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Some information was useful, but some was common sense. I felt the author repeated the same thing over and over again,that I found myself skimming through some pages! But it was a nice read. I really enjoyed it. I'm really going to use some of his tips for meeting new people, because that's always fun! And I really recommend this book to people who need motivation for going out.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|When I launch game I get error &#34;device not supported&#34;. My daughter loved their other game which played just fine and wanted to play this one, bummer! This is the only app I have ever had that wont run.
1600597963|5.0|Great book with wonderful pictures. Instructions are detailed. Lots of design ideas. Can't wait to make something to wear for myself.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|I have followed this series from its inception and once again I find myself waiting for the next one --- a winner for sure and well worth 5 stars plus !!!
B009AMAGXK|1.0|The horrible accents ruin the movie almost immediately as the narrative starts as the opening scene shows from the title sequence. I didn't read the book so I had no preconceived ideas or expectations. I simply watched the movie and took it for what it was. Unfortunately the movie never really grips you and sucks you in. There aren't any likeable characters at all, not one. The male lead is cocky and super corny and the female comes off as a bitchy know it all, why are you wasting my time I'm obviously smarter and more important than you type. I've heard both good and bad things about the movie so I gave it a shot. I was extremely disappointed and almost everything bad that I read was spot on. Don't waste your time, it's bad.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|This a great sequel to Matched that make me want to read the last book in the trilogy.  Got to the end and I want to know what happens to the characters next.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|The barrel arrived today (I live in Mexico). Amazing collection! Everything in order. The only problem is the season 1 and 2: no spanish subtitles.
B006J420UE|5.0|If your motherboard has an F1 socket, buy this CPU while you still can, it's becoming difficult to find. For those of us with F1 sockets, this is the highest end chip that it will take. I swapped out an AMD A4 for this a couple of weeks ago and the increase in performance is clear. This is an APU but I have the Radeon component disabled in BIOS in favor of using an Nvidia card. Switching to this quad core even while still using the same old video card resulted in an increase in 3d performance so great I did not expect it. Also, I run Linux and source code (in general) compiles at least twice as fast over my previous dual core A4.
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|This turned out to be a great bargain for some holiday music. Interesting arrangements on traditional music. Get it you will like it!.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was really looking forward to using the Chromecast. I ended up being severely disappointed. The controls on mobile are a bit wonky and sometimes it doesn't recognize that a Netflix episode is over, so I have to completely close the Chromecast app and the Netflix app to reset it. It seemed to get better with time, but it's not perfect.<br /><br />Netflix and Youtube seem to stream fine via Chrome browser, but you can't stream much else. It's awful. This is pretty much the only reason I bought the Chromecast, and it doesn't even work. Try to stream a video on a tab? Prepare to watch either a very small video or just listen to the audio! You can watch it small - as it comes in a normal tab - but as soon as you make it full screen, the TV screen goes black. The audio continues to play. It's apparently a very common problem and there doesn't appear to be a fix.<br /><br />Overall, this product isn't worth it. Get a Roku. The interface is better, they have working remotes, and they actually work like they should. I'd give this a one star, but I recognize that they're working on it. It has a long way to go before it gets above two stars for me. Right now, it's just a crappy Netflix browser.
B00009NQQO|2.0|The netting ripped right away and my daughter was very gentle with it.  Also the balls ripped along the squirt holes.  We were down to 1 ball within 3 months.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great book, suspenseful and very well written. A love story with a twist. I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more by Kate Morton.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The series, not just this book. Jordan, Sanderson, and Merrilin described it so perfectly: exquisite.

All the songs are AMAZING!!!! well, what can you expect of a album with the unique vocals of the legendary Layne Staley and the magic guitars of Pearl Jam´s Mike McCready.......If you like ALICE IN CHAINS, you just GOTTA hear this brilliant ABOVE, from MAD SEASON........Layne shine high here....WELL DONE, layne!!!! Your magic music will live forever........TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written, just trash.....I read many good sensual  books, this is not worh spending time with............The choice of words is disgraceful.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|A great movie to end the Harry Potter series. Recommended to any HP fan!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A lovely story, very original, fast reading, full of fantasy........I enjoyed it all the way through. Yann Martel really gave it his all.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I really liked this book.  Unfortunately I picked it up at the time not realizing it was part of a series, and not complete.  So the ending of the book came as a complete shock to me when it ended without any resolution, haha.  Other than that it was a very interesting twist in the fairy tale, at some point I would love to see the resolution of Cinder's story, and I will be picking up the second (and third) book at some point.  The writing style is a little awkward in some parts, but the story was still enjoyable enough to overlook anyway.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I watched it on the big screen and had to have it. Excellent movie and have watched it quite a few times already.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I love Doctor Who! This was perfect for me. I missed an episode and couldn't find it On Demand or online anywhere. I found it here and was more than happy to pay to see it. It played perfectly. No problems at all. Terrific resolution. I have a few favorite episodes that I love to watch over and over. I think I might get those as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't stop playing. So much fun! I am not one to play things over and over, but I have to force myself to stop playing this one.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very good movie, the acting and effects were excellent, but I found the subject matter to be somewhat disturbing.  My kids (11 & 12) seemed to be ok with it and enjoyed it.
B00ET47USI|5.0|I've gotten smitten by this game. Love. It's really fun. Just tap a card and it flies to it's place. You can also drag cards to their space. It's so much fun. I keep trying to beat myself. Really fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's the greatest book ever! The second book of the Hunger Games and nothing could beat it , a mixture of death , romance , murder and all kinds of drama you DON'T WANT TO MISS. Get this book!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|So easy to use and it connects quickly and without issues.  The power supply cord is a bit short, but we found ways around that.  I am looking forward to seeing what else Google permits to be &#34;chromecasted&#34;.
B00006I53S|5.0|Good Lens and good Product !!!!  . I'm a fan of Canon  so I hope I can buy more another Lens.
B00CBKLO52|1.0|Terrible flying. Even with controller set on &#34;low&#34;, it's way too touchy for my Phone, Galaxy S4. Good graphics at least.
B00003CXB4|4.0|Make sure you select the original version or you will be disappointed by simbas pouncing lesson. (It doesn't exist) they took it out of the newer version.
B00BWYX2MG|1.0|Didn't work at all for the iPhone but worked for a little while on a Garmin GPS - then stopped working
B008476HBM|5.0|I love the civility of the old English romance and pompous attitudes .  It is so contrary to America and their easy relationships, at least in my years of knowledge.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love all John Grisham's book.  Someone criticized his writing saying if you've read one of his books you've read them all.  I know what he means.  The stories are similar but I find them all engaging and the absorb me into the whatever drama is unfolding nor does he telegraph the ending.  I think the main character is always Grisham and he seems a decent, intelligent, down to earth guy who cares about what he is doing.
0385333846|5.0|I enjoyed this book in every way, from the alien to the war and everything in between.  It's is a very &#34;akward book&#34;, and i like it because of that, you really don't know what to expect in the chapter, if your not locked up with an alien mistress you getting shot at enemy soldiers.  I read this book more then once, it just never gets old.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|BLURAY: You will notice a big difference in this films picture quality! If wondering to upgrade to a bluray version- you should.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book was definitely the best of Grisham! Easy to read ...holding the readers interest in such a grip that made it almost impossible to put it down before the finish!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great dangle for fun.<br />Easy to configure, and watch anything from your iphone to show up on big LED TV is fun.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Jim Carrey is one of the few actors who are as physically talented (with facial changes and vocal expressons).  It's a holiday must for children and adults.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is a cool fighter. I need to get all the characters, so I am cookbook addicted! It has great graphics, and is a great game( ps, im just writing this so I get a new character.
B008JFUNKU|5.0|I'm familiar with several Tom Hanks movies.  They span the spectrum from humor to the newest movie, Captain Phillips.  I saw this movie in the theater.  It was terrific.  The big screen and 'super sound' added to the thrilling excitement of the movie.  The popcorn was great!  If you're a movie collector, its a must.  Being so familiar with other 'Hanks' movies, I've become more respectful of his talent which is sensational.  I'm adding him to my collection.
B007704HO6|5.0|Endearing true story about a man and his cat. I will certainly see the movie if and when it comes out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Because the way they would make people feel that there in the game<br />Wonderful game to play<br />Good game to play
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I think this is a good book<br />It has vet good detail involved I'm so happy I read this book
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|Impossible for her to make anything less than a great album. Maybe not as great as Blackout or in the Groove but with more listens it may rate up with her best.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ok so I am a huge huge hunger games fan, but I got to admit this book, this series, is the Best I've ever read. The ending  of this book had me crying for a good solid 20 minutes. Not just crying full on balling my eyes out. The relationship between tris and Tobias is heart warming and I just fell in love with them. Disappointed in the ending.. because it wasn't what I was expecting and I wanted to have another book to read after... but in all AN interesting series I'd recommend to anyone
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Not as great as Blackout or In the Groove but still better than anyone else. I wonder where she will go nect?
B005AUWY90|4.0|Great movie at a great price.  Pixar Blue rays are extremely overpriced at stores like Walmart and Bestbuy.  With Prime it shipped free and arrived super fast for a fraction of the cost. Not as good as the original Cars or the Toy Story Series but my 2 year old loves it. My only gripe, which is a very small one, is that it does not have a cardboard sleeve outside the Blue Ray box like my other Pixar Blue Rays.  Just a small gripe.  The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is a rating on the movie itself.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|so much has been written about this book I don't know what I can add, but I'll try.<br /><br />Teenage boys- they are a ridiculous group of people.  John Green, however, continues to give me hope for them (& as the parent to one, this is fantastic news!).<br /><br />This is a book about friendship, love, literature, adventure, & of course- high school.  The characters in this book are wonderful- with the possible exception of Margo Roth Spiegelman who was a brat (but was clearly written to be a brat).  Everyone should hope to have people in their lives like the characters in this book- or that their kids have people in their lives like Quentin, Radar & Ben.  This is a book that made me smile over & over again.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|It's all and all a decent game but the only set back is that like iron man 3 they are trying to rob u blind more than give you a entertaining game by making everything you need in the game something you have to spend a lot of money on in real life
B000K7UG34|3.0|For a person who has experienced the joy of Army life this was light entertainment.  It appeared staged like a carton.
B002N5N5QQ|1.0|This show has undone all that it has taken the  motorcycle community 50 years to accomplish in getting the public to realize that people who ride are just like everyone else and not a bunch perverts, murderers, and amoral degenerates!
B00006RAKP|5.0|I really like Elton John's older music from the Seventies.  This album has a lot of great soft music. The price was great with that many tunes. If I would have bought the songs individual it would have cost me a fortune.  If you love Elton John this would be the CD I would recommend to buy.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Great mic!  I use it for training videos and it picks up my voice no problem.  The cord is nice and long so I do not need to use an extension on it.  I like the fact that the battery / power compartment has a clip on it so I can attach it to my belt and not have it dangling.<br /><br />Just remember to shut it off when done!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game, addictive<br /> and fun<br />Got lots of friend turned on to playing this game.<br />Highly recommend this game as a fun way to relax in the evening
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Really great for finding words, their definitions, and their origins. Also good for finding out where countries are located, and more.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|These women have the voices of angels, they make me laugh, cheer and cry. Anyone who loves and appreciates beautiful, talented women from Ireland, this DVD is a must. It will touch your heart.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|It is a very addicting game!! But it is very fun and enjoyable!! U should definitely get it!! U will love it!!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The game is fun but at times it is slow. That being said I really like playing the game.<br />Keeps me wanting to play more.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|This movie was a lot of fun!  Just campy enough to be comic book, but not so campy as to make you roll your eyes.  Honestly I would have preferred it to be a little bit longer so we could get some more back story on the human characters -- Jane, Darcy, Eric -- in addition to the Asgardians.  I really enjoyed everyone's performances, though Tom Hiddleston's Loki is by far the most engaging character.<br /><br />Some of the cinematography was far too clever by half, with dizzying CGI landscapes that, while beautiful, were too dark or too abstract to really appreciate.  But when Brannagh pointed the camera at real landscapes and real people instead of CGI constructs, it was wonderful.<br /><br />Fun, exciting, beautiful colors (Thor's cape, the gold of Heimdall's armor, Loki's turquoise eyes - everything pops), and really good performances from all the leads and the supporting cast.  If you're looking for a movie to wile away an evening, I certainly recommend Thor.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Everyone I know needs to read this. Pretty much sums up how I try to work and how to get the most out of your time.
B006LSZECO|2.0|First of all, this book started off in the most amazingly descriptive way. The reader develops the characters throughout the entire story, and you really feel as if you are being spoken to, mentally, by the character. The imagery is precise, the story DOES have a nice flow to it, even switching back from character to character. All of my praise goes out the window within the last 10 pages. The end of the story ruins the whole gosh darned thing. As a &#34;tunnel vision&#34; reader I was thinking about basically nothing about this book until I finished it. The ending is so dissatisfying, I was actually really angry. If the nice customer service agent hadn't accidentally refunded my purchase, I would've been mad that I paid money to read this with such a craptastic ending. I'm weary to buy another book from this author because of that slap-in-the-face ending.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Glad to have this on my kindle.  Can't wait to see what comes next and how many of the same characters will be in it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved this third book as much, if not more than the first. Too bad that this is the ends Salander!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|1 of the best stories ever written in my eyes especially to be the 1st  in series i wonder how he can follow up with better if it is i think i may have a new favorite author TT gg martin
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|I think I played it one time? I hear it's great fun, but I just didn't want to spend my time with it. Honestly, this is an arcade game, and deserves to be left there.
0767903862|4.0|Bryson's book will perhaps dissuade the timid traveler from visiting Australia, for while his descriptions are - apparently - accurate, nonetheless they paint a picture of a wilderness populated only by venomous creatures who are all ready to do you awful harm.  Australia is a lovely place, and not nearly as dangerous as Bryson's accounting would have you believe.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Recent upgrades have turned this app from a basic email-reading depository into a viable second version of your computer's Yahoo. My only annoyance? When my phone gets an email, the notification remains after I've read it online. Perhaps I need to adjust my sync settings?
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have worked two puzzles so far and I think that it is cool. I did not know that there was any puzzle apps.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|So much fun, and so addicting. Yes, the craze got *too* big when Angry Birds showed up on pillows and socks and underwear, but this is still a great time killer when you want to smirk. If you're JUST getting into Angry Birds, start with this one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am very impressed with Google chromecast product and it has been very useful especially if you use your laptop more often.<br />Thanks to Amazon for delivering before time.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|So much fun, and so addicting. Yes, the craze got *too* big when Angry Birds showed up on pillows and socks and underwear, but this is still a great time killer when you want to smirk. Seasons is just another update, and good fun.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is an amazing cheap/simple solution for getting your online video stream to your TV.  Setup is a breeze.  With dedicated apps (I use Netflix and HBO Go) the playback is fantastic.  My experience is that there is very occasional additional buffering that halts playback briefly.  This is probably due to the internet connection speed being sluggish (I'm under the thumb of TWC NY, which is a pretty terrible service).  Using the apps on my phone I occasionally find that the cast button disappears, which requires restarting the app and/or disconnecting and reconnecting my phone from the WiFi.  In the grand scheme of things these are very minor inconveniences when weighed against how fundamentally awesome this product is.<br /><br />The device is easily portable and once set up it can be unplugged from one TV and plugged into another on a different WiFi network with minimal fuss.<br /><br />With streaming directly from the Chrome browser (you need to install a small add-on to your Chrome browser for this) I find the playback ranges from very smooth to quite choppy.  I would, again, attribute the choppy playback largely to my internet connection speed.  Nevertheless, I caution people with regular &#34;high speed&#34; cable internet against purchasing Chromecast if flawless playback from Chrome is your primary goal.  For me, casting from the Chrome browser is just a bonus feature.<br /><br />I note that I used to stream online content using a Samsung &#34;smart&#34; BluRay player.  The smart player system was constantly failing to initialize apps, hanging, declaring that content was not currently available, and logging me out.  After putting up with this for over a year, using Chromecast was an absolute revelation.  I have seen the light -- five stars for awesome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this on facebook and then I downloaded it onto my kindle fire so I could play anywhere. I love this game so far, and I hope to complete all the levels.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|Very fun game, easy for the kids to play. Good graphics and cool sound effects. Would recommend to anyone!!! Pretty fun.
B005FQ2H8W|3.0|not a good movie; my memory of it ranked higher but it had its points; some scenes were fun. After so many years, the graphics were out of date.
B00BAXFJ5M|2.0|As usual with Baldacci, some logic & procedural gaps.  I wasn't at all entranced with the very far fetched storyline.  He's reaching deep for new conspiracies.
B00003CX95|4.0|Too long for watching casually, but when you are in the mood for epic clashes, large scenes and lots of history (not totally accurate), it is a good sit down with popcorn treat.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|This is one of the most important books I have read in the past year. It is solidly researched, presented in practical language that is applicable to real life, and hold the potential to transform the way business is done to the benefit of all. Thank you Dr. Grant for an excellent book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS GAME IS AMAZING. I LOVE BEING ABLE TO INTERACT WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS. IT TOOK A WHILE FOR ME TO TRY IT... BUT NOW I AM HOOKED!
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|House of Gold and Bones Part 2 has a good mixture of mellowness and hard rock. It's masterfully done in my opinion and probably one of the best buys I've made this year.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|This is a great game on my kindle. It provides a unique challenge that isn't boring. It,s easy to play. However I am not a fan of in game purchasing. Especially considering the ridiculous prices. What makes it worse is that the game has an energy bar that you need to go hunting. When it has depleted you have the option of waiting over an hour to let it naturally fill or you can buy ten coins for five dollars. It is a free game I feel like it may be worth maybe seven dollars if I were to pay. Either way the way it is set up you could easily spend over 100 dollars and still not have full access to it.<br /><br />Overall fun game. Unfortunately due to in game purchasing and ridiculous pricing earns this over rated game one star. Barely that because you don't even get the whole game after spending money
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|First off, when I \\"casted\\" anything my TV would change mode to DVD. This was annoying but I learned to just change it back to the correct setting. Today I watched 2 hours of YouTube then my screen went pink. When I got up thinking I needed to cycle the power I was amazed to see the dongle had MELTED and was hanging at a 45 degree angle off the HDMI (I plug into a Yamaha receiver video controller.<br /><br />This thing is buggy at best and a fire hazard at worst. I will be reporting it to [...] in hopes to get it recalled.
0714845183|5.0|The postcards are beautiful.  After I received my first set, I bought four more sets for my friends and so I could have an extra set.  I do not plan on using them as postcards, but as oracle cards. I did not write on the back of the cards, but I made a small book to accompany them.  The coloring is darker than on posters that I have see, but they are still wonderful.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I been playing this game over and over,it is very addictive but some of the levels are harder than others and how do you sync ipad,kindle,  and phone to be act the same levels...
B0002OERI0|3.0|It's Green Day, I need not say anymore! However I must say I do still love the information that comes in CD cases
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I have watched so many people playing this game and found myself so excited when Kindle finally received their version. I am intrigued by the excitement and challenge. But, I refuse to pay the additional money to move on to the next level. I find the additional costs crazy.
0811879542|5.0|One of the best children's book I've read. Defiantly going to be one the kids remember. I would highly recommend it.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My son and I love The Gruffalo - it's a well-made adaptation of a great children's book. Helena Bonham Carter's narration is first-rate. We've watched it many times! Nicely-done animation too.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|MacGyver is a one man &#34;Mission Impossible.&#34;  He is always fixing and finding ways to take care of what ever the problem is, just like the old Mission Impossible tv show used to be.  Is intriguing and fun to watch.  You get caught up in the story and outcome.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|This is the best performance of this play that I have watched. It's not as good as the play in London, but it's a close second!

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It is a great game full of action so much excitement wonder will I service or will I parish I  hell
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is hard to put down and has twists every minute. I loved the book and you should definitely read it!
0385486804|5.0|Into the Wild is such an interesting book and everybody should read once in their life. would recommend to a friend
B00H1KX87E|5.0|Julia Gousseva’s skill is placing her readers in space and time – her space is Russia, her time the days before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a time when every person across the vast nation had a sense of being watched, that feeling creating a paranoia that she summons to the page as well as a joy that bursts out unexpectedly in passages of sheer exuberance. I have read her earlier works and came to Anya’s Story with an expectation that was not disappointed.<br /><br />Here we meet the eponymous Anya as she prepares to leave her sophisticated city life in Moscow to move with her submarine officer husband to his new positing with the Northern Fleet. Anya had found a sense of balance after her marriage but the move to the forsaken ends of nowhere tests her emotions, her loyalty and her love. Gousseva in her writing discusses man’s condition, as much as his nature, and it is here where we find the conflict that drives her subtle and scholarly writing.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Our whole family LOVES this Christmas album!  My daughter arranges her own music and this is just the inspiration that she needed to keep using her gifts that God has given to her!  The Christmas songs are beautiful!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just saw movie #2 this evening and then finished reading this book tonight.  Amazing story line.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute, every chapter.
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|Excellent deal!!! Was very happy with this!!! Price was right and got alot for my money. Definitely recommend this to any Batman fans
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|This is by far Ms, Spears most personal album... I was not sure why &#34;Work Bitch&#34; was picked as a first single as I see many other songs as stronger lead singles. However, the song is filled with great dance pop songs and some slow tempo ballads. &#34;Perfume&#34; shows off some of her strongest vocals.. The album is far from a &#34;snooze-fest&#34; as some have said. Passenger can easily seen as Katy Perry song by the lyrics but Britney does a great job making it her own.The album shows her growth and maturity as an artist and why 15 years later she is still considered a very relevant part of Pop and music culture This album shows her stand and how  out of all the Pop Princesses from the early 2000's she still remains the top pick and seller. After many disappointing albums from other female artist this year I feel this is an amazing 8th album from what I feel is one of the most inspirational and talented yet unique artists out there.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|We enjoy listening to Susan Boyles Home for Christmas CD.  She is a gifted singer and sings from the heart.
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|This is a clear step forward for Lady Gaga--but it is a step away from the strict commercial formula that made her famous, and that has caused some backlash in the media.  Other than &#34;Do What You Want&#34; (which is a canny choice for a second single), the songs don't really fit the pop mold of what is on the radio, though they certainly operate within that medium.  But the beats are harder.  I think &#34;Aura&#34; is really the best thing on the album--inventive, challenging, still with a hook in the chorus.  Like a lot of other songs on the album, it owes a lot to the late 80s/early 90s Industrial Dance movement.  I hear Front 242, Ministry and Nitzer Ebb as influences on a lot of the tracks here--and that's a good thing.  It follows on from songs like &#34;Government Hooker&#34; from BTW.  I think there are missteps here--&#34;Jewels-n-drugs&#34; is not good, and neither are &#34;Donatella&#34; nor &#34;Fashion,&#34; really.  But &#34;Venus&#34; successfully updates the wackiness of the B-52s, as does &#34;Sexx Dreams&#34; for the sultry side of Prince.  Lady Gaga is challenging herself, and that is interesting in a sea of pop music that usually aims for the lowest common denominator.
006202406X|2.0|so disappointed that I had to wait a year for this<br />there's just so many things I didn't like about this book I don't even know where to begin,<br />first of all this book is told from Tobias and Tris points of view but I honestly didn't feel any difference ,<br />the main plot of the book which is that they get out of the city to find out they were just a government<br />experiment hugely disappointed me and kind of made me feel that the first two books were for nothing,<br />and Tris dying was the final drop that made me lost my love for this trilogy<br />I would have preferred the story to end on the second book :(
0545626382|5.0|I can't stop thinking about this series. Great books, well worth the money. Only disappointment I have is waiting so long to read them. Shame on me.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|You can't go wrong with this movie. A classic I watch not only during the holiday season but all year round.  I love the original black and white version, being an old movie lover. Have not watched the colorized version yet.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|so far it seems easy and it is fun. i would like it if there were a few more steps on each level.
034580404X|5.0|Very good writing. I just hope they don't ruin the movie. From what I've heard the film has issues. They need to pick the right people to play Christian and Ana. They really need to get that Hamm guy perfect choice.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Another misogynistic Bond movie. If only all intelligence agencies were as incompetent as MI-6. These fools gets bombed, shot, chased, p'wned, and surprised at every turn of this movie. Homophobic plot twists and a plot that beggars the imagination with the idiocy of the technology employed by the characters.<br />Really, a waste of time generally. Some good action sequences. Give it a pass. You won't miss much.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I absolutely love Gillian Flynn!  You truly become part of the book!!!  Thought about Camille throughout my day!  Quick read, more please Gillian
0425252868|5.0|I loved this book! I have a great fondness for B-17's in general, and that, plus the humanity expressed in this book brought me to tears. The author stated that &#34;good men could be on both sides of a bad war,&#34; and that describes this work perfectly. I can't recommend this work highly enough. As a writer myself, I wish I had gotten there first!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so fun<br />great for any age even at forty<br />if you love minions play now<br />tons of obsticals<br />so easy to play always gives you instructions before trying something new
B0098XY5VK|5.0|This is a fun game to play. Very addicting and a great time killer when waiting for time to go by.. I love it. The only catch is that it costs .99 cents to unlock the whole thing..
B008LA7RM0|4.0|This is considered to be one of the best CD's ever made, even by members of the Beatles (can't remember which ones).  I liked the one with the stereo songs ONLY a bit  better, because it has notes from Brian Wilson that are fascinating, if you are interested in the personal side of this musical genius.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|I love this show.  People say that I'm like Leonard, which I guess is the best of the male options on the show.  Just wish I could find my Penny...hahaha...
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This came is a great game for anyone who wants a logic based strategy game. Don't be fooled by the simple graphics. The game is a challenge on standard mode and takes a lot of skill to figure out how to infect the entire world. Make sure not to miss the small islands, especially Greenland. Otherwise you could have survivors that cost you the game.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|amazing... read it over and over. i need a life. haha kill me now I hate sports die ball sucks
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Filled in the gaps from hbo series will read the rest prior to next season. It's all in the details.
030014332X|5.0|I'm 26 but still enjoy this book more than history books aimed at adults. It's well written. The language is simple with poetic undertones. He really knows how to make a read easy and enjoyable. I read this for pleasure as well as to learn from it.
0062059963|1.0|Where to even begin? This book was a roller-coaster ride and not in a good way. America's emotions were kind of all over the place and she was so wishy-washy on both Aspen and Prince Maxon that my eyes were aching by the end of the book from all the rolling they had done. It was like the slightest action would have her go from one guy to the other. I don't remember her being this indecisive in the first book and it was very annoying trying to keep up with who she was mad at/in love with now. I also didn't buy a lot of the relationship drama/conflict because 99% of it could have easily been solved by the characters simply talking to each other about it instead of just assuming the worst every time. Seriously, how hard would it have been for America to just *ask* Maxon why he had suddenly decided to go on more dates with the other girls? It wasn't like they had gotten into an argument or anything before that, they'd actually shared a rather tender moment. Shouldn't she confront the guy before assuming he'd just moved on? Especially considering he was professing she was the One? It was as if because America was herself very indecisive, she assumed everyone else was naturally just as indecisive.<br /><br />I don't really buy into the love triangle Cass is trying to sell us on because Aspen has pretty much been a shadow for the past two books. Unless his character is significantly fleshed out in the third, I can't realistically see him as a viable option (not that Maxon is all that great of option either, but more on that later). I just feel like we don't really know all that much about him besides that he was born a six, dated America for 2 years, and is now a soldier at the palace which automatically elevates him to a two. I don't really understand why he is still pursuing America considering in book one, he said part of the reason he hesitated on asking her to marry him was because he wanted to wait to see if he was drafted and he didn't want to put her through the whole army wife thing. So now all of a sudden neither one of them has a problem with that lifestyle? I really wish we had more insight to Aspen's motivations and life goals or even just his life views now that he had been elevated to a two. I also don't understand why he and America were being so reckless after what happened with Marlee. He was almost caught by the maids at one point. That would have scared me enough to reconsider some of the things they go on to do.<br /><br />As for Maxon, I liked him until...***spoiler alert***... he kisses Celeste. His reasoning (of wanting and needing a distraction) was kind of a load of manure to me. Because it's not like America doesn't kiss him. He and America have kissed plenty of times, so why on earth would he need affection from Celeste, of all people? Had his reasoning been different, I could have actually forgiven the kiss. If he had said something along the lines of &#34;look, this might be a game to you, but at the end of this I have to choose one of you to be my wife and I have to live with for the rest of my life. Since you've already told me this is something you may not be interested in, I have to give these other girls a fair chance&#34;. Because that is something America sorely needs to hear, that she has the ability to end this all now. But instead, Maxon blabs on about needing distractions and the whole thing kind of just makes it seem like he can't be trusted.<br /><br />At this point, I'm hoping in the end America seriously grows up and chooses neither guy, instead deciding she needs some time to work on herself.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Bleak & sludge-paced.  I lost interest in Main Character Theo (what a whiner!) around page 7,500 of this 20,000 page book.  Theo’s friend - The Polish Guy - is one huge cheesy stereotype.  The whole unfunny bromance reads like an add-on pasted into the story after the book’s completion, probably in hopes of providing some comedic relief from the unimaginative misery & strangulating pace.  Plus Tartt saves her Really Big Ideas for the end – at which point we’re way beyond benefiting from stale observations about Life, Loss, and Purpose. Just want the thing to be OVER!  Editors, where were you?
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Good updates to the free app. Kids will continue to learn their alphabets with this app. Highly recommend this app.
B00F2362IE|1.0|I bought this game on my kindle fire for my nephew. I cant even give feedback on the game itself because after several attempts, it wouldn't download. Luckily the money was refunded. There are better options for tmnt games!
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|Oh, this is fabulous music.  You can listen to this record time and again and again; you will not get tired.  Bocelli's voice is the sound of angels.  This is one purchase you will never regret.  Listening to it lifts your spirit.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|From the prologue, the armies in the Westlands put together with prep intended for Tarmon Gai'don, as complete the allows in the Darkness. The actual Forsaken Demandred levels a new raid for the town of Caemlyn, mailing Trollocs for you to catch Aludra's Dragons, produced along by means of Matrim Cauthon, Double Elayne Trakand and the Illuminator Aludra. Talmanes Delovinde and the Wedding band in the Reddish Give kick off their very own counterattack and properly remove the Dragons outside the town, although Caemlyn is misplaced. The actual Light is bolstered by means of men and women via around the globe for you to deal with, sensing the end of most factors. The actual Darkness welcomes Mazrim Taim to be a brand new Forsaken thus to their rates with thank you intended for their service with switching a lot of channelers for the Darkness. He's been granted a new title from the Darkness, acknowledged just as M'Hael. A different in the Forsaken occurs with the achieving, a good unattractive lady referred to as Hessalam, acknowledged ahead of as Graendal.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It's a pretty good game, best hunting game I have ever played on a mobile device. For being free, it's pretty good
B009QU9X44|4.0|This was a good read, although I didn't read it all at once. Several times I put it down, not picking it up for almost a week or two. I had %68 left when I finally had time to finish it. It kept me engrossed, it was exciting, then finally when I got to the end of the final chapter... it ended, yes' just like that it ended. I first thought I had flicked passed the last chapter, but I hadn't... it just ended... what I'm trying to say is that I was disappointed with a dead ending. Worth the read, shame about the end.
B00GPBZQ3Y|5.0|Britney Jean by Britney Spears showcases Britney Spear’s musical talents through a relationship and seizing life type of sound lense.  I enjoyed listening to her new release from this perspective due to also liking other songs that also touched on the romance angle such as And Then We Kiss,Break The Ice,  If U Seek Amy, and Gasoline. She continues on this unique angle with catchy songs such as Alien, Work, Perfume, It Should Be Easy (feat. William), Tik Tik Boom (feat. T.I.), Body Ache, And Brightest Morning Star. However, personal favorites from Britney Jean are most likely going to be as diverse as those who listen to her music (including myself). Britney Jean by Britney Spears is great for those who enjoy listening to music with elements of synth-pop, eurodance, and electronica.
0618918248|5.0|Best book ever written to counter religion stupidity.<br />Dawkins is the best and most intelligent proponent of atheism.<br />He destroys the religion hypothesis with real arguments
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I will start off by saying I didn't like this one as much as I Ioved<br />the first two. I was slightly annoying that through pretty much the whole book you couldn't tell who the point of view was coming from. (Tris or Tobias) with that being said I did enjoy.the book alot! I hope Veronica makes another Trilogy. Looking forward to more stuff from her.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I did not think I would like this as I am a fan of the Chris Reeves, may he rest in peace, superman.  But. I love this one!<br />The plot, the actor playing superman, all of.  I want to see more of this actor playing superman. Nice to see a reason forthe S rather then to stand for super man and I hope the ditch the tights for the uniform .  makes more sense, but then I am NOT a fan of comics , only good movies made from them, so I am not a purist .
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We LOVE this show! Great special features. I loved that it was two seasons in one package. Shipped fast! I will definitely be ordering season 4!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Bale's performance is second to none in this movie.  His weight loss alone is an example of what he brings to his character.  The producers asked him to stop losing so much weight during the making of this film.  Film gives off a great creepy feel.  Must have if you enjoy movies like Jacob's Ladder or Shutter Island
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Saga: GOOD NAME!<br /><br />Very frustrating as not enough time to complete levels therefore stuck forever on the same level. Unless of course you want to use your credit card to move on...No, I have more important things to use my money for.
B0029NY9Y4|5.0|I hate super hero movies.  I enjoy Nolan's Batman films and Watchmen, thats it.  This movie is what superheroes would be like if in fact they existed.  Visuals are stunning.  Excellent movie
B003G4W49C|4.0|Book starts out really engaging.  Fast read.  Full character development in an excellent setting with great situations.  Unfortunately the auther fails to tie it all together in the end, and even abandons a few of the well-constructed plot lines.  Somewhat of a disappointment at the end.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Love Wes Anderson's quirky directing.  Perfect for children's movies.  This has an all star cast but its the two unknown main characters who steal the show, who by the way are kids.  My parents found it cheesy so maybe its not for everyone but I loved this movie
B001AQO3QA|4.0|It's Alien. The movies alone, stand the test of time with the visual effects. And the story lines aren't that bad for a sci-fi/horro flick. Add on the additional commentary and different cuts of the films and you have a solid gift.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I've gotten some good games on the android, this is the first one I've tried that  I would call great.  It's not too hard or too easy. It involves some thinking about what you're doing, but it's not rocket science.  There is alot of humor in it.  I have an Acer A500, and no problems with the game. No force closes or lag or any of that.
B008MVPF4K|5.0|the coushing works well for a big man who stands on seament all day, helping with ancle, knees, &lower back pain.
B00EEL0LGY|4.0|I like most games with an upgrade option especially if it's well made<br />I like how the game looks and controls pretty easy and fun
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book by an American hero and is a great gift for anyone interested in becoming a one. He wiil be missed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love the game. it is fun to play, and my younger siblings love it too. i would give this 5 stars!
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I love how easy this app is to use.  You write it & it types it & does the math for you.  Wow!
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Another great cd from Alan Jackson. This style suits him well and he does a wonderful job on it. We love it. That voice still sounds awesome.
B00E8S2KV2|4.0|Great story.  1 disc had some smudging on it. I will attempt to clean it.  Hopefully that will take care of the problem.
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|to tell you the truth, (because that's all I know), this game was dissapointing... I guess that I was expecting something more...
B00BD99JMW|4.0|A heart renching tale of young love, Tris must battle once again everything she knows. Her world is turned upside down in a second very well written at this part for one feels the emotions of Tris and wonders along with her what is in store for her future. A plot twist and a thrilling ending which personally, I did not like. The series ends with gasps and questions that will never be answered. This trilogy ends in a powerful way, a read you wont want to miss! Only some parts to me were predictable and some parts were redundent and seemed like they were from other books. Otherwise, an interesting enjoyment read!
B0061S0A64|2.0|Didn't really make sense... I'm not sure why I wasted my time with this FAOTD, but it must be fun or interesting to someone... just not me... sorry...
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|This game is a strategy game that requires patients and some foresight. My advice, don't use your crowns on potions or extra troops in battle, or even to instant finish a building. Use your crowns for architects. Oh and have fun.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Boring, boring, boring, boring.... WHAT?!?  This book was depressing and uninteresting, but I forced myself to finish it and then was rather upset that I did.  I realize that this was an attempt to branch out, and I do typically read adult novels.  I just do not recommend this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire ist ein fantastisches Spiel. Es ist unser Lieblingsspiel. Our Favorit.<br />Ich wünsche mir aber, dass die Karten besser gemischt werden. Better Merge the Cards!<br />Es liegen oftmals immer die gleichen Karten zusammen. Most are the same cards together.<br />Best Wishes,<br />Steffen from Hannover, Germany.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Picture looks great and works great with my ipad and iphone, close competition with apple tv.  Made old tv to a smart tv.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game with my kids. It's very easy and user friendly, I recently downloaded the game on a kindle and so far I can't seem to put it down.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I recommend this series to everyone who loves getting close to the series their reading and to anyone who is searching for a great read for a change!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Scenarios I could scarcely imagine. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to imagine a new apocalyptic renaissance ……I can't wait to read book two!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an amazing app to have if you have grand kids, children, or just yourself. I am truly addicted and I just bought it 2 days ago. (: Everything is free! Buy it for fun.
074322454X|3.0|Not a great book, but required reading for school.  Parts were more readable than others.  At times the author just names players to name them.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|great game and love the story line, keeps you going for hours and hours.  I think it rivals all hidden object games.
0142405809|5.0|We are hugh fans of Julia Donaldson. My 3 year old grand daughter and I have many of her books and DVD's. We love them all but this one especially. It's a sweet story thats fun to read and the illustrations are wonderful. I suggest this one, Room on a Broom, The Spiffiest Giant, The Gruffalo's Child, Charlie Cooks Favorite Book, and Stick Man. We love the DVD, Room on a Broom (its even better than the book!).
B00EI4V3X2|3.0|Bought this pair to use on my PS3 and PS4. Sound and mic quality are great. All the functions are too. But I have some complaints.<br /><br />First of all, I was led to believe that there are only a few headsets compatible with the PS4. Apparently, any analog headset (3.5mm audio jack) works just fine.<br /><br />Second, it is not completely wireless when used on the PS4. To use the chat function, you need to connect the audio jack to the controller (I'm hoping a patch will fix this soon).<br /><br />Third, the cushion sucks. It makes annoying noises because it gets rubbed to my glasses. And it isn't comfortable for my ears. It feels more like an on-ear instead of over-the-ear because of how thin the padding is. I don't get why they make comfortable memory foam cushions for the Earforce Seven models for the Xbox and lousy cushions for this pair.
B0027MJU00|4.0|God read. I expected a twist in the end. Don't want to be a spoiler, so I won't say whether or not I got one. Find out for yourself.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|John Scalzi has a great story here. I did like the first and second book better but that is like saying I like strawberry ice cream over vanilla. I still couldn't put it down so 5 stars.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|it awesome!! i love it that movie .. i meant... &#34;DRAG&#34;... how i spelling it.. (:P) so , i i did buy it already from the store.. today .. i love it!! awesome Actor Paul Walker!! &#60;3
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Picked this book for a book club. Everyone loved it (even the women) and several people including myself continued reading into the next set of books. Couldn't put it down. John Scalzi did a great job.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|best ever that movie is  awesome~~!! i m shock that game is same name of movie .. it is awesome!!
B00EJ2WBX4|4.0|Totally 80's synth-pop but with a more modern electronica esthetic. &#34;Recover&#34;, &#34;We Sink&#34; and &#34;Lungs&#34; are my favorites. Lauren Mayberry's vocals are perfection.
B001DSNEJM|5.0|it is amazing .. movie .. i miss him.. because Paul Walker is awesome actor and beautiful smile so far .. yep , i m fan of Paul Walker.. anyway ,  i think that movie is good movie ..  yes..
B0081ISUOG|4.0|It does exactly what it says it will do, which is good. I don't use it often, but when I do, it works well.
0440237688|2.0|I'm an eighth grader, and I'm reading this for the second time. Okay, I guess. No attachment at all to any of the characters, and there are many plot holes. How is this a Newberry Honor Award winning book, I ask? Very good writing and description, but not very powerful topic or characters, like I've said. The main character finally gains dimension (Jonas), but everything else is bland. There is no excitement in the story except for these flashbacks the Giver and Jonas experience. Who do we like? Who do we hate? Who do we support? Why do we support this Jonas? The only interesting part is the (SPOILER ALERT) when they leave this plot hole ridden society with this baby we're sympathetic to because he isn't perfect. Very boring. Please, just pick up any other dystopian future book like ANTHEM by Rand Ayn or THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins or ANIMAL FARM by George Orwell (It uses animals as a metaphor towards real life political problems, which is convenient). Even though they are full of Republican ideas, they make you think harder than this boring attempt that doesn't deserve the hype (Sorry, Lois Lowry, but it's true).
B0090P98Z4|4.0|it is a great game but it seems like all the glu game feel and look the same but I still like all glue games
1452101248|4.0|The Recipes are great but the ingredients are expensive and sometimes hard to find. I loved it at first, and then lost interest, as it seemed to just be &#34;too hard.&#34;
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great game reminds me of diablo the story is easy to follow but they should update there graphics but its still a good game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging fun game. Good when you want to waste time goofing off or just plahing a game. Really fun.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Before I watched the Hunger Games I thought it was just a rip off of Running Man, but it is a stand alone story, despite the similar themes. This story illustrates that, even in a horrible world, all types can be found and that even in the worst of situations, some people choose to retain their humanity.
0066620996|4.0|In this book, Jim Collins hits it right on the nail, giving companies a “cookbook” on how to go from being a good company to a great company. With an emphasis on leadership that will pass on knowledge to future successors and getting the right people on board to work for you, Jim writes on detail how to transform a company’s culture in order to become a great company.<br />Jim emphasis on real life examples such as Circuit City and Walgreens, makes the reading that much interesting and pleasurable since you as the reader can see the current ideas working on those companies. Although it doesn’t show the great companies that have gone from good to great in today’s world, such as Amazon and Apple, Jim shows the essential ideas that a company should follow to go from being good to being great. One great example is the idea of getting the right people on the bus. Jim mentions that in order to have a great company, companies should get the right people on the bus and worry about where you are heading to later. In the other hand, Jim mentions that companies that never go from being good to being great tend to have a direction first and try to get the right people on the bus on the way to the goal.<br />The only reason why I gave it four stars is due to the outdated companies that are presented in this book. Other than that, I would recommend this book to anyone that has an ambitious personality and anyone that is willing to be different within their company’s culture. Most big companies have a set culture in today’s world and is hard to try to change the culture, but with Jim’s ideas in this book, you may have the tools needed to make an impact and turn your good company into a great company.<br />.
0920668372|2.0|I love Munsch but it's creepy to read a book to your kids about a mother sneaking up on the kids.
0439023521|4.0|First of all, the book's front cover has a little scratches...but overall the book is very good! I think the seller is ok~
1451695195|5.0|Have had a major attitude adjustment this year. Would have been a naysayer prior. Glad the Universe was patient with getting me to read this book. Excellent. The most uplifting book I've read in I don't know how long. I was so touched by it that I've roamed You Tube for videos of the author, read the debunkers, read the folks who have debunked the debunkers. Extremely solid evidence. I can only encourage you to put your BS (belief system) on pause and read this book with an open mind because it's sure to be blown.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I have enjoyed all the Vorkosigan books since I was introduced to them maybe 7 years ago and was delighted to find Ivan as the main character.  The story provided as fun a ride as the others and I was glad that Ivan finally found a match worthy of him though he did it all backwords.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Well made movie, if you enjoy the Walking Dead, this is a little different spin, but worth watching. I enjoyed the movie and watched several times!
B008KHRODG|5.0|This DVD set includes the final episodes of David Tennant's Tenth Doctor, and although it's maybe a little pricey for \\"only\\" five episodes, they're technically specials at the quality of short-films (and won awards as such, I believe) and the set comes with a satisfying amount of special features (full length Doctor Who Confidential behind-the-scenes videos, audio commentary on the final two-part episode, David Tennant's video diaries, Doctor Who at the Proms (which is a concert) and at Comic Con, and deleted scenes), so all and all I'd say this set is more than worth the money.<br /><br />(spoiler-light brief thoughts on the specials themselves)<br /><br />The Next Doctor is my favorite out of the Ten era Christmas specials. A proper Dickensian gothic nightmare complete with workhouses and the Doctor Who twist of Cybermen. It's great fun and gorgeous to look at.<br /><br />Planet of the Dead is probably the weakest link of this set of specials, in my opinion. There's little to no actual plot advancement or character development that wasn't already covered in previous episodes; really the only important bit is in the last five minutes or so.<br /><br />The Waters of Mars is probably my favorite Doctor Who episode that I've seen. It has a lovely old-school sci-fi feel, complete with a Mars base and an alien infection. The supporting cast are one of the best and Tennant gives one of his best performances in an episode that pushes the Doctor's character to new and scary extremes.<br /><br />The End of Time (Parts 1 and 2) is worth the price of this DVD set alone if for nothing else than for Tennant's performance. Some of the writing trends dangerously near melodrama, but Tennant's performance grounds it in a believable sincerity. It's a more than satisfying conclusion to the story of the Tenth Doctor and one should probably have tissues handy when watching.<br /><br />So yes, all and all a great collection and ultimately worth the price.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|You get what you pay for. It will probably protect the phone just fine, but the edges are a little floppy and it doesn't fit perfectly.
B00G6MW63K|5.0|I was very lucky to see Muse put on a phenomenal show at Madison Square Garden in April 2013, and have been a huge fan for years. My first impression is - this CD is phenomenally produced. It does a great job translating the energy of the crowd, which really adds to the music. The mixing and camera work are both absolute top-notch; if you've been getting by watching YouTube clips of the band, boy, are you in for a treat. One thing I enjoyed in particular is that the live instruments - the drums and bass in particular - came through much clearer and more raw than they do on the recordings, giving the overall sound a more hard rock sound, which I personally loved.<br /><br />However, the best part of the CD for me was the energy of the crowd and how the band seemed to respond. Matt is on fire, and you can tell Dom and Chris are having a blast. Muse have called this show their best of the tour, and I can see why.<br /><br />One last thing - get the blu ray if you can! I got the DVD, and while it's still wonderful, I'd really appreciate the phenomenal 4K quality.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book in high school and fell in love with the series.reading it again more then ten years later, it's still such a great book. excited to watch the movie though I doubt it will be as good
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Go ahead and drink the Kool-Aid you won't be disappointed.<br />Love, love, love this book and cannot wait for movie........<br />Reading this one sucked me into reading the other two....enjoyed the story line immensely.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Very good reviews on this item. Very good response time and all the buttons work. You get that new controller smell when you open it. LOL (from my son)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved! No need to say more, the perfect ending to the story of Ana and Christian. I enjoyed the whole series greatly. Would love to see more of this style.
630463949X|5.0|I have been a fan of Fleetwood Mac/Stevie Nicks for a very, very long time.  This filmed concert, which kicked off The Dance Tour (1997/1998), was my first time seeing the band live in any real capacity.  I remember my Dad took me to a show on the Shake the Cage (Tango In the Night) Tour (sometime in 1987/1988) but I was too young to have any real memory of it.  I remember a couple songs and lots of screaming fans but beyond that ... this is why you don't take ten-year-old kids to rock concerts lol.<br /><br />Anyway ... I saw The Dance on TV.  I purchased the CD, the VHS (yes, the VHS) and later the DVD ... I began investing in Fleetwood Mac's back catalog (I already had everything Stevie had released to that point), and as soon as tickets went on sale I purchased a ticket.  I'm glad I did that since Christine McVie did not participate in the 2003/2004 tour, the 2009 tour, or the current tour.  Crossing my fingers that recent rumours are true that she wants to come back.<br /><br />Aside from The Dance Tour, I've seen Fleetwood Mac live on the Say You Will Tour ('03/'04), the Unleashed Tour ('09) and their most recent World Tour ('13).  This DVD performance still holds up to how excellent the band is performing these days.<br /><br />As a live recording The Dance is amazing; the audio CD is nice but the DVD is what you want.  I remember walking through shopping malls in 1997 and all the audio stores were blasting this concert on their televisions to advertise their sound systems.  The picture quality is still amazing - my PS3 does an excellent job up-scaling the quality a bit - and the audio is just as awesome as it was back then.  I recently had to repurchase this because my old copy was damaged.  The only real difference was packaging ... my original DVD had a thick paper/cardboard (?) casing, but I'm sure that only held true for the first few pressings.  This copy came in the standard DVD jewel case.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book! Good story, not cheesy. Didn't know what to expect on that ending.....loved the surprise. Also loved the general story line also an easy read. Looking forward to reading Losing Hope.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Could not stop reading it and cannot wait to see the movie.<br />The most entertaining book I have ever read.<br />You can also pickup some interesting business tips.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved, loved, loved....this one does not disappoint the saga of Anastasia and Christian continues in this book with a few more unexpected twists and turns....
B0057URWSQ|5.0|I had always heard about this show, but never had the chance to watch it. After I watched the first episode, I continued and finished the first 3 seasons in less than a week and a half. It is like a really good book that you can't put down. Excellent show!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book......I felt so many emotions when reading this one, it really pulls at your heart strings. (love, severe loss, anger) I really liked story and the writing style of the author.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Our four year old grandson has watched this DVD multiple times. We love the music and the messages about how life works.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|The movie crapped out at the beginning.  I would have love to see it because Charlie Hunnam is in it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Who would have thought a basic (and functional) weather app would be difficult to find? I downloaded and deleted at least three or four before finding this one. One wasn't intuitive at all, I couldn't find the settings and when I did they were vague, another one from my local news station looked nice but couldn't manage to keep my town in the settings and kept defaulting to another city not close to me, and yet another one only displayed the current conditions and forecast overview but with no hourly breakdown, which I rely on. I was tempted to download The Weather Channel app since I visit their website on my desktop PC daily but the reviews after their last update were horrible.<br /><br />So I saw this and gave it a go. Much to my surprise it's everything I wanted, a basic, functional weather app that's easy to use. It asked me for my location and has kept my town saved ever since. The graphics are crystal clear and very easy to read at a glance. The layout is easy to understand, a menu on the left lets you choose 'now, hourly, daily, maps, video, news & locations' (where you can add other towns to check grandma's weather, etc). Then to the right are all of those options displayed left to right. Clicking at the left menu shoots the right side to whatever you chose, or you can just scroll through it directly. Everything I can think to want is displayed, temp, sunny/cloudy/rain etc, realfeel factoring in wind chill, and all your other basics, wind direction, speed & gusts, UV index, dew point, pressure, etc. Just today I was able to see the alerts in action, two appeared, one is a clearly visible red exclamation mark alerting me of black ice on the roads this morning and another in yellow cautions me to expect showers late tomorrow night.<br /><br />There's a refresh button too, which I find handy. One feature that I really rely on when checking the weather is a moving satellite/radar map, which this has. I was surprised to see many apps don't have the satellite option at all and a couple apps claimed to have satellite imaging but it was still shots; I want the satellite in motion so I can see the progression of oncoming storms and color-coded severity. This has both satellite and radar views and both can be played in motion and can be zoomed in or out as needed. In the app settings you can change various general options, decide what you want notifications for, change time and date format, wind speed format, etc. This app can be tilted as needed as well, to display portrait or landscape views which I appreciate since I vary how I hold my kindle depending on whether I'm lying in bed or sitting upright.<br /><br />The version I have is free and does display an ad but it's at the lower left of the screen, is non-intrusive and is easy to avoid accidentally touching. This app is really quite perfect for my needs and I have no complaints. Clear and bright graphics, easy to navigate and functional. It's a winner, no more weather app hunting for me!tion at all and a couple apps claimed to have satellite imaging but it was still shots; I want the satellite in motion so I can see the progression of oncoming storms and color-coded severity.

B001NLKSI4|4.0|I had no idea where this book would take me. I cannot believe this man was capable of such measures and how long he got away with it before he got caught. Being filthy rich and wasting it on such frivolous things blows my mind. I understand a little bit more about Wall Street and it makes me want to run away in the opposite direction. I remember the crash in 1987 as well as the 2002 and the 2008 messes we got ourselves into and I cannot believe all that was done to cause such insanity in the investment world. I am so glad that I walked away from Wall Street. Good book if you want to know how the filthy rich live.
0345803450|2.0|&#34;...Jane Austen meets John Le Carré meets John Barth...&#34; as the back cover reads.<br /><br />Well, I LIKE Jane Austen, I like John Le Carré, and I even kind of like John Barth.<br /><br />I also happen to like garlic, and peppermint, and pecan pie. Just not all mixed together.<br /><br />This was a difficult book to read. I really had to slog through it, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. The story was okay, but I didn't have much love or sympathy for any of the characters. They seemed contrived, false, mannequin-like.<br /><br />Moreover, a 60-something man writing in the first person as a 20-something girl just didn't ring true, and -- SPOILER ALERT!!! -- when the twist at the end comes, i.e. that it was indeed a man's writing the whole time (&#34;To re-create you on the page I had to become you and understand you...&#34;) - well, that's like when screenwriters write themselves into a corner and it turns out the whole thing was just a dream somebody was having. WTH?<br /><br />So after having invested a lot of energy wading through all those WORDS (the book is only 374 pages long but it SEEMED like 1374), I felt like I had been robbed of a bunch of hours of my life that I can't get back.<br /><br />I'm giving it two stars because it was an okay book - I didn't hate it. But it's going into the charity bag ; I'm not spending space on my bookshelf for this one, and I can't in good faith recommend it to any of my friends. I'm also not going to read any more Ian McEwan, no matter who recommends him to me.

B00DBOF5Q6|4.0|This is the story of Dorrigo Evans, a surgeon from Tasmania who joins the Army and spends time as a POW in a Japanese camp during World War 2, working on the construction of a Thailand-Burma railway.  His life is shaped by this experience, as well as by an intense love affair before the war.  However the story widens in scope to encompass many of his fellow soldiers, his captors and his family.  It moves forward and back in time - which initially takes some time to get used to - and has a haunting, almost dreamlike quality.<br /><br />I didn't find this book easy to read, partly because of the frequent changes in perspective but mostly because the descriptions of life during the war and the atrocities dealt out by the Japanese are quite simply horrendous.  There is one story late in the book told by a Japanese doctor which I found particularly haunting.  While the book is fiction, parts are based on the life and experiences of the author's father and other parts are based on other real life events.  So there's no easy dismissal in your mind.<br /><br />At one point in the book someone makes a comment along the lines of wartime being comparatively short but feeling like it went forever and this book really captures that.  Flanagan slows down his focus for the wartime segments - taking several chapters to describe a day - and then speeds it up again after the war, jumping years at a time.  While the specific memories are gradually lost, the impact remains.  Which is kind of how I think I will be about this book.
B00H2UFHBI|5.0|I was so excited to find one of my favorite series of the year collected in this wonderful box set. If you haven't read Brandt Legg's paranormal trilogy yet, I'll break it down for you:<br /><br />OUTVIEW (Book 1)<br /><br />The book that kicks it off is a corker. I loved it even more the second time around. On reflection my initial review (from 10/16)  could have said a whole lot more (I didn't know what a ride I was in for!). Here it is:<br /><br />Really cool story about a 16-yr old boy plagued by nightmarish visions in which he is transported to violent moments in history. The characterizations are smart and the writing overall is very polished and slick.<br /><br />OUTIN (THE INNER MOVEMENT - Book 2)<br /><br />A great second installment. This book continues the adventures of Nate and Yangchen and the story of the Movement. The book is about young adults but can be enjoyed by all ages. It neatly intersects sci-fi, adventure and paranormal and is a very well-written and compelling story. Brandt Legg has improved on his impressive debut and should only continue to flourish as an author.<br /><br />OUTMOVE (THE INNER MOVEMENT - Book 3)<br /><br />I have been eagerly awaiting this book since falling in love with Outview and Outin. I am happy to report that Outmove, book three in this exciting trilogy, does not disappoint! Book 3 starts off fast and the relentless pace continues until the unexpected climax. Hero Nate becomes the leader of the revolutionary movement against the dark forces of Omnia and this makes for an exciting plot. I was blown away by many of the plot twists and reversals. If you haven't read this trilogy, you are in for a treat.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Quirky, edgy thriller that delivers the crazy. I started this late on Thanksgiving Day and the next thing I knew it was 5:00 in the morning and I was plugging in my tablet so I could finish (doncha love the fabulous Kindle apps for every device? Sure, I have a Kindle PaperWhite that I love yet sometimes I like to read on the tablet). Spect the sequel will star Amy as the sociopathic emerging serial-killer that she is on her way to being. Yes, I thought the last several chapters were hurried, and lacked the depth and polish of the rest of the book--that said, this book is one fantastic wild ride. How does the saying go, \\"H-ll hath no fury like  woman scorned?\\" (or in this case, h-ll hath no fury like an angry, disenchanted wife). You will not regret reading this book, even if you don't love it as much as I did. Think page-turner, thriller, creepy, weird and edgy (and surprising, up to the point where the author reveals what is happening, and still fascinating after that point). Happy reading~*
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my 3 kids (ages 3, 5 and 7) will play this game for hours on end. you don't need to buy nothing to play it non-stop which is the best part. plus it's pretty easy to win points to buy extra minions and you don't have to spend any real money. love it! other games really limit you so you feel like you have to buy their &#34;currency&#34; to get the full effect of the game, thankfully this one doesn't!
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|A lousy album...no body...poor solos...lack the essence of the original Rock and Roll band. Tom you are dried out. Shoot.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my 3 kids love this game (ages 3, 5 and 7) they play it for hours on end, well actually they can only play so long before they run out of &#34;funds/currency&#34;. wish these type of games didn't make it so necessary to purchase extras and on top of that they have 2 or 3 different kinds of &#34;currency&#34; for the game. if they only had one type of currency I might be more apt to purchase it for the kids. also it costs a lot of money to buy this special MLP currency(s). if they made it to where I was getting more for my money I wouldn't mind buying the MLP currency, but you get waaaaaay too little MLP money for REAL money. nice try gameloft but we all aint that rich.

B004M9ZI0M|1.0|Taymore's 'Titus' is the most fun Shakespeare film out there, and one of a small handful of the many deliberately anachronistic cinematic Shakespeare adaptations that actually works. Taymore is one of the most interesting directors working today and her work, whether for stage or screen, is always, in my experience, worth a look. 'The Tempest' is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, alongside 'Lear' and 'Macbeth.' And I absolutely love Helen Mirren. When I heard about this film I was really looking forward to it — what I saw was so painful I had to turn it off, and it really hurts me to rate this the same as the abominable 'Romeo + Juliet,' because I'd EXPECT nothing less than an abortion from the like of Luhrmann and DiCaprio (I bailed halfway through that one, too), but from really talented people like Taymore and Mirren... ?<br /><br />Visually, it's muddy looking and unexpectedly ugly. This is a real shock, because visuals are usually a Taymore strong suit. Worse, her handling of the text seems flip and uninspired. Mirren sounds like a terrific choice for a female Prospero, but she simply wasn't strong enough to get me past the unfortunate elements. The digital effects were distractingly junky-looking. Many of the supporting actors were very badly miscast, and the performances nails-on-blackboard annoying. I really don't want to go on. It's an unmitigated stinker, as far in as I got, and a real lost opportunity.<br /><br />A better bet is the recent stage production (available on DVD) starring Christopher Plummer for his absolute command of the role of Prospero. Plummer is a pleasure to watch, and easily the main reason to see it. A personal favorite, if you can find it, and if you can stand Peter Greenaway (and if you can deal with Taymore, who has been disparaged as an &#34;ornamentalist,&#34; I don't see how you could have a problem with Greenaway) is the extraordinary 'Prospero's Books,' in which John Gielgud plays Prospero and reads all the other parts as well. It seems to be (criminally) unavailable, although I've seen it on the web, and in my opinion, Greenaway has found a wonderful visual and aural compliment to the poetry of the play.
B0095G5AFU|4.0|This is a nice app for creating, saving, and organizing a lot of notes but it would be much more useful to me (and maybe others)  if it had the ready ability to do lists.  A lot of notes I make are really to-do lists, check lists, priority lists, etc.  If this app could do that I would be able to replace my current note app.

1608838137|5.0|This series is superb quality in every way.....production, writing, acting.  If you allow eyes to wander, the set design, house and grounds itself are a visual feast.  It is a wonderful way to learn about a period in time when all things changed. The grand homes of Lords and Ladies are about to become more socially and economically responsive. Despite their titiles and wealth, they are no longer insulated from the common man.  It's a fascinating period of change.

B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|First I must preface my review of Perhaps Love.  I began singing in the 5th grade through high school and college  Sang in mixed choirs and an A Cappella  choir, performed a leading role in a musical and participated in singing contest to the state level.  I played 3 brass instruments a B flat trumpet and cornet and a B flat single French Horn, yes there is one, in concert and dance bands and an upright string bass in a symphony orchestra.  I was good but not great therefore I did not pursue a career in music.  I feel that with my background I can  pen a fair  and non  biased review of Perhaps Love.<br /><br />\\"Perhaps Love\\" leaves me a little ambivalent wishing it was an extension of  \\"Together\\" show casing Jonathan and Charlottes ability to sing in Italian and Spanish to explore several true operatic duos.  Of course that is my personal preference.  I do enjoy listening to the CD and play it daily.  The artist continue to amaze their fans with their exceptional solo voices yet the true beauty and magic of their work is when they harmonize, two very different and distinct voices combining to produce a sound that is beautiful and magical which takes their fans, there are no adjectives in a thesaurus to describe it.  My favorite is \\"Endless Love\\", one gets the feeling that something really wonderful is going to happen when Jonathan begins, and then the harmony is unbelievable.  Are you listening?  When the artist start a seguway beginning at pianissimo and crescendo to fortissimo Charlotte is right there with Jonathan two distinct voices in perfect harmony.  This performance should set to rest the question of Charlotte's ability to sing with Jonathan at any level.  The listeners must remember these are two teens that are developing at a phenomenal rate through hard work and excellent coaching.  Charlotte seems comfortable performing from mid level alto through mezzo soprano to lyric soprano.  Charlotte's choice of solos was interesting two show works and Caro Mio BenChar as her classical solo.  My initial thought was Charlotte what were you thinking when you chose Caro Mio Ben Char as your classical aria being very familiar with it (see you-tube) it's performed by dames and divas.  Charlotte's performance was very credible for this difficult work  Charlotte's overall performance on this CD, we have a saying here in the US, \\"you earned your bones\\"  .One day you will be a voice to be reckoned with along side  Sissel Kyrkjebo, Lara Fabian, Sarah Brightman and if you chose opera Elina Garanca.<br /><br />Jonathan is Jonathan if he chooses to study opera he will be in the same league as Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras two very famous Spanish Tenors and the excellent Italian Tenor Vittorio Grigolo.  I am sorry but because of Jonathans voice timber I don't think comparison to Caruso or Pavarotti is a fair assessment of his ability.  I especially enjoyed Va Pensiero as one of his solo choices the other two were typical Italian songs.<br /><br />I will  give this CD a 5 star rating because of the excellent performances by Jonathan and Charlotte.  I am looking forward to their next CD  hopefully it will have more duets in Italian and perhaps one in French.  I am a seventy-nine year old opera and classical music buff.  I have seen in my lifetime many young talents appear only  to get caught up in the rat race and disappear into oblivion.  Keep your humility and friendship and when you are feeling overwhelmed go back and watch your initial BGT audition.  Jonathan and Charlotte may God bless you and may your careers be long and prosperous.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really liked this book...but it left me wanting more! I loved how all the characters had pictures in the book.

006202406X|3.0|I am very back and forth about this book. I don’t hate it as passionately as some readers, but I didn’t love it either…and I LOVED the first two books.  I kind of agree with the direction the author was going in, but the execution wasn’t really there.  I am still VERY much looking forward to the movie. Let’s just hope the screen play writers and director can tweak the third installment a little to improve it for the big screen.  That will be one movie that If they don’t stick to the book, the audience may appreciate it more.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|[...]<br /><br />I've come to the conclusion that there's something about dystopian trilogies that inevitably lead to the same conclusion: The existing government is overthrown by the rebel-led insurrection, but something always is amiss. Maybe it's just me, but the finales for a lot of dystopian trilogies tend to fall flat (Ally Condie's \\"Matched\\" series comes to mind here), and leave you feeling a little disappointed at how an exciting beginning can end almost lifelessly. \\"Allegiant\\", the third and final book to Veronica Roth's riveting \\"Divergent\\" trilogy, left me feeling that way, bringing what could've been an unputdownable series to close.<br /><br />The world as Tris knows it has disappeared. The factions have been abolished, fractured by betrayal and violence and replaced instead by a new, problematic society led by Tobias' mother, Evelyn. So when she is offered a chance to explore the world beyond the fence, a world in which she and Tobias can find a simple new life together, Tris is more than ready to go. But when she discovers that her new reality is even more disturbing than the one she's left behind, with secrets that force her to examine her loyalties and discoveries that change the hearts of those she loves. Once again, Tris must fight to comprehend the complexities of human nature--and of herself--while facing impossible choices of courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.<br /><br />I know my introductory paragraph up there hardly left any room for optimism, but trust me when I say that \\"Allegiant\\" isn't a crappy book. In fact, Tris and Tobias' character developments were interesting to read about as the book progressed, especially since it is the final book in the trilogy, which means that they will soon reach the crux of their character journeys before the last page. Tris, to me, is an awesome heroine. Not only is she a brave, butt-kicking and stubborn protagonist, but she is also compassionate and thoughtful, which, I guess, is the whole point ofher role as a Divergent: Tris is an amalgamation of all these different characteristics which make each and every one of us human, from erudition, dauntlessness, abnegation, candor and amity (see what I did there). Watching her as she deals with conflicting problems and new, life-changing discoveries, as well as with her relationships with her family, friends, and Tobias, reveals the huge amount of change she's gone through since the beginning of the series. Tris is, without a doubt, a great heroine you can't help but become invested in and root for from the start, and I'd even go so far as to say one that you can look up to as a sort of role model.<br /><br />The same, unfortunately, can't really be said about Tobias. If Tris is the epitome of a teenaged heroine, then Tobias is more of a gritty, 'real' character, with possibly more faults than admirable traits. I understand that growing up, Tobias had to deal with a butt ton of issues that left a lot of emotional, mental and physical scars, but there were times when I just felt like he was kind of annoying. This might be because of the comparison between his perspective and Tris', since the chapters alternated between their two points of view. There was definitely a sort of emotional journey that he goes through, what with his mother and abusive father and Tris and so on, but I still felt like he ended up as a character I lost interest in. On the other hand, he and Tris were generally pretty sweet as a couple, with a strong and believable dynamic between them that allowed them to mature both individually and as a pair. I just wish Tobias himself was a little more likable and strong as a character, especially since he was pretty great in the first two books!<br /><br />The real disappointment I felt toward \\"Allegiant\\" was about its plot. It seemed as if the real action was over in the second book, and \\"Allegiant\\" just dragged it on for the sake of having a third book in the trilogy. Like I said before, the storyline is pretty generic for a dystopian finale, where there are post-insurrection problems that make the characters realize that everything is not as they seem. The pace was pretty plodding throughout the entire novel, and there wasn't much of a climax either. In a way, it's kind of like the storyline meanders this way and that, and never skyrocketed in tension or excitement. This may be due to the fact that Ms. Roth was trying to tie up all of the loose ends from previous books, in terms of Tobias' family and Tris' struggles with Caleb and being Divergent, but it ultimately fell flat.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Allegiant\\" is a pretty disappointing finale to what had been an exciting and refreshing dystopian trilogy. It's unfortunate to see such great world-building, strong characters and riveting storylines decline to a dull end, as much as I (really, really, really!) don't want to say it.<br /><br />Rating: 2/5

1401917232|4.0|&#34;The way you see people is the way you treat them, and the way you treat them is what they become.&#34;<br />  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe<br /><br />Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a writer and politician born in Germany in the mid 1700s, knew then what is still relevant today - projection makes perception.<br /><br />Gary Renard, author of Love Has Forgotten No One - The Answer to Life says so too.<br /><br />I just finished this book about how our ego is like a smoke screen and complicates our lives making us believe we are separate from each other. I walked away from it with a jolt of perfect love.<br /><br />Renard has also authored several other books, The Disappearance of the Universe and Your Immortal Reality.<br /><br />Love Has Forgotten No One contains Renard's mystical experiences with two ascended masters who channel an ongoing, lighthearted, conversation of Renard's evolution through his current, and past, life experiences.<br /><br />Many of the concepts unfamiliar to those who have neither experienced A Course in Miracles (ACIM), nor read any of Renard's other books, might find this loving book's concepts a bit foreign.<br /><br />Had I not been in the midst of taking ACIM, I may not have recognized how to go about creating perfect love with everyone. I wouldn't have understood the true depth and life-changing nature of Gary's complementary messages with ACIM.<br /><br />A key message from the book:<br /><br />  Our ego makes the whole thing up.  What we see and believe about life is an illusion. Stop perceiving our world and our reality from our ego. Perceive life as God intended it as perfect, whole and loving human beings, from one to another.<br /><br />As Gary says, &#34;The ego denies the truth, the Holy Spirit denies the ego, the choice for holiness is mine.&#34;<br /><br />Now let's get crackin' to undo our ego. I want another big jolt of this perfect love, how about you?<br /><br />I send you my love, blessings and wishes for a prosperous andabundant life!<br /><br />(I was not financially compensated for this post.

And most importantly, its small size ensures I ALWAYS have it with me.  I can't think of any negatives.  I just bought a second one for a Christmas gift.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Great movie! Story within a story..May have taken many years but justice was served.. It was surprising who was the Master mind behind all of this..Love Magic then you will enjoy this...
B00004Z4SD|1.0|Horrible movie... even in fast fwd it is slow, but actually doing so made us laugh.  Think tractor racing across Iowa. Only bought it because the bridge scene at the end was filmed in my hometown.
1609611543|5.0|Good information,how our Food supply is changing,and why we have a health crisis in this country,and how to help yourself
B004PGO25O|5.0|Excellent and thought provoking. The War of Art another  book by the same author is also worth reading. TWO THUMBS UP!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is the best out of all the plague games definitely worth the money wish they had more plagues though.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a great game!  Let me know what I am able to receive and the part that is later in the up coming levels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!!!!! I would always play on my moms phone but then it was on the kindle fire. this game allows you to be challenged but have fun at the same time. the only thing I don't like is that u have to pay 99 cents after an amount of levels. you should really get this game. by the way if you get a donut put it with a striped
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Fantastic show. Sharp, smart and slightly dark drama. Love both Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright in this. Can't wait for Season 2!
B0055SWM08|3.0|Either it has not been optimized for Android 4. 3,  or not completely compatible with the Galaxy Note 3.  It doesn't seem to save perfect scores for the level progress.  Otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars.  v
B00BAXFJ5M|3.0|I've read sample chapters. I want to read more. Clearly, Baldacci is a master at his craft.  Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are two extremely compelling, modern-day protagonists-- former Secret Service agents turned private investigators. Definitely a worthy story backdrop, much like THE MADNESS ANALOG ..a 5 Star-acclaimed eBook thriller which is available on Amazon.com. Essentially, it is for lovers of terrorism novels and secret agent stories (Daniel Silva, Lee Child, David Baldacci,Tom Clancy ), just like King and Maxwell.
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|Great Book but this review isn't about that.  Amazon sent me a Book Club copy of the book so everyone needs to be very wary when ordering a Hardback of this book.  They obviously need to learn what the difference between book club and a regular hardback. I work in a bookstore btw.  Buy this book for sure but buy the paperback so you don't get screwed over like i did.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I'M having a blast playing this game.....it's addictive to me  !!!! :) I think you should keep on making games like this. Especially for the outdoors man ! I hope to keep playing and getting other s to play as well!!! Thank you ! :)
B00AEBB9T6|1.0|Wooden acting, dull cinematography, and an uninteresting plot made me stop watching this halfway through. With a title like &#34;Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow&#34; I excepted a fun, if childish romp of an adventure.
B0058ZZBVK|2.0|Two episodes in I am not convinced I want to continue watching.  The plot is mildly interesting but the acting is a little too forced, the characters are extremely exaggerated and there's no real artistry in general.  I guess I've been spoiled by shows like Breaking Bad and Mad Men to enjoy anything new!
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and thought it was great!  Makes you view birds in a whole different way.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game ! And I think that there should be more levels but over all I love this game and I'm always playing it.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|Hilarious movie- classic Will Farrel at his best- a must see- will leave you laughing the entire movie long- a must buy
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|Haven't even watched an episode yet, but I hear it is a great series and now I have it at my beck and call.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie- classic Star Trek at its best- a must see- will leave you on the edge of your seat the entire movie long- a must buy
B006CLTFP2|5.0|Music from the best television series that has ever been out.  I love the show and I love the music.  Great album!!!!!

006202406X|3.0|When the book arrived it was broken..<br />- But the book is amazing though, and since i got it for a really small price it's fine.. (:
B0076DCT2G|1.0|This book was the worst Nelson Demille I have ever read.  The first chapter or two are great, then Blah, Blah, Blabber, and just on and on with the worst dialog I believe I have ever read.  Then, just before the end, it picks up again.  Pass on this one people.  Wish I had read the reviews before buying.  Putting this one out in the garage sales for a buck.<br /><br />Seriously disappointed in Demille on this one.
B0006APDRE|5.0|I had never read an Agathie Christie novel, but felt this was a good introduction.  I love being made to think and this novel did just that.  I was constantly coming up with theories of my own inregards to the development of the plot only to have to evaluate my theories and change them as the story progressed.  The ending was quite unexpected, but very well developed.  I recommend this novel for those who love a good mystery.
B000GL1BHO|5.0|Like always Papo has done a magnificent job on the paint and sculpt. It's only flaw is it's inaccuracy. Papo is known to base their Dinosaurs on Jurassic Park film designs and in this case the Pteranodon from Jurassic Park ///. Though I am a fan of the Jurassic Park films the design contradicts the name.Even though Pteranodon means &#34;toothless&#34; this figurine does in fact have teeth. If they were going for JP designs they should have gone for The Lost World. It is just a minor nitpick though, great figurine none the less.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I absolutely loved this film!  If you're looking for a movie that will leave you feeling good this is definitely the movie for you.  I love films of this nature in which you can't help but fall in love with the character's honesty and innocence, and I absolutely adore characters like Henry Tilney.  They are just gentleman and that character type is not often portrayed in the films we watch today.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My family and I have had so much fun playing this game. By far one of my favorite games ever made.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|Okay, first off, let me begin by saying that I rarely give negative reviews. Most often they are left by customers who didn't know how to use their purchase, or possibly received a defective item. This is not the case here.<br /><br />The item was received new. Shipping was pretty fast. I decided to test my new purchase by trying it out on my Victorinox swiss army knife. Not only did the ceramic stones not sharpen an already-average-sharpness blade, it actually dulled it somewhat with the 8-10 strokes that are recommended on the packaging. After re-sharpening my knife back to usable condition (I think that's supposed to be &#34;useable&#34;, but spell-check disagrees), I went to sharpen a friends' S&W folder, which was extremely dull from use in a machine shop. Both the carbide and ceramic elements failed to produce even a workable edge on this knife. I wound up just using the diamond hone as a standard sharpening rod, which worked good enough to reverse some of the damage caused by the other 2 sharpeners on this tool. I will definitely be buying a Spyderco sharpening system instead in the near future.<br /><br />I would not recommend this sharpener to anyone who expects it to sharpen anything. I wanted something small and portable, something that might be found in a bug-out bag or wilderness survival kit, in which size, portability and functionality are paramount. While small and very portable, sadly, its functionality leaves much to be desired..... in particular, a sharp knife.
B000B589JI|2.0|The washer in the filler cap isn't thick enough, so it doesn't seal.  The thing leaked like crazy.  I cut a second washer from an old bicycle inner tube and put it behind the one it came with.  That worked for a few days, but the inner tube rubber didn't stand up to the naptha in the fuel.<br /><br />The reviews for this item made it pretty clear that most of them leak.  So, rather than exchange it with Amazon and get another one that leaked too, I contacted Zippo.  I wasn't particularly pleased with Zippo's lack of response, or their claims of responding when they didn't, and sending a return mailer that I didn't receive.  After a series of exchanges with Zippo over a few weeks time, they apologized for dropping the ball and mailed a replacement.<br /><br />The replacement had slightly different packaging, so I had high hopes.  But, the second one leaked too, just not as badly.  Zippo didn't want the first one back, so I took the nozzle and filler cap washers out of the first one and doubled them up in the second one.  With double washers, it didn't leak.<br /><br />The item is not fit for its stated purpose.  So, if you buy one, keep in mind that you'll need to add another washer or replace them with thicker ones.  Once you get it to not leak, it's nice, so it earned two stars instead of just one.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Farlex's Free Dictionary is a lovely combination of standard internet  reference points, including the British Wikipedia as well as access two a couple of encyclopedias and a dictionary. I find that I generally start here when I begin to research almost anything, although I generally do include other sources layer on.<br /><br />Wikipedia just keeps getting better, and the British version does have slightly different strong points including a more European eye toward the social sciences.<br /><br />I have never regretted paying the small fee.
B0064BWE8U|3.0|Great light read. Quite funny and although predictable in parts sometimes it’s nice to have something light for the commute or a rainy day.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Absolutely the very best!  I could listen to this every day and not get tired of it.  (and I do)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's awesome ,loved it, kawaii as frik I loved despicable me the movie of course I love the game aswell
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've already read this twice and recommended it to anyone who will listen. If you've ever experienced a loved one going through a serious illness, this YA novel just speaks to you regardless of your age. While I can see why this would speak to YA's in particular, I strongly recommend it to adults-especially those with kids. These characters were some of the most real I've read in a very long time. Certainly the best book I've read in many years as well. It captured a lot of the reality of terrible situations and portrays both the teens and adult characters with depth and empathy.
B0012NVGHU|2.0|An over-hyped movie that isn't worth your time and money. The cinematography is like a home movie. I found it boring.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Been a fan since the original series and these films are far and away the best product in the Trek franchise in a long time. I like the whole reboot concept and I hope they keep this cast together and make some more down the road. A great Kirk, Spock, and McCoy with all the great interaction and just amazing effects as well. Even the music is an amazing enhancement. Nothing's ever perfect, but I can't really find anything to really complain about in this movie or the previous one for that matter.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Epic. Violent. Life is complete! Both this and dumb ways to live are great! Live the blood love how it gets harder and faster with progress if little kids gave heard the song let them take the pledge then everyone is free to play all day!
B00E9A656K|1.0|I HATE THIS GAME IT SUCKS BECAUSE ITS TO HARD AND I HATE DRAG RACING AND IN THE GAME THE UPGRADES  AND CARS ARE WAY TO PRICEY
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Yeah. It's cool. Different from temple run minion run and subway surfers. Same concept same fun same challenge coolio. Get o<br />It. If you're kids are bored or you are B-) pres it'll get you to shut up awhile.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is a great musical.  This CD is a beautiful memory of our trip to see Wicked and I can listen to the music over and over, especially the song &#34;I'm Not That Girl&#34; sung by both of the leads at separate times.  AutoRip is a nice Amazon feature too!
B00AK57N00|5.0|Played if before became a fan. Lost the name of the app an couldn't find it but when I finally did automatically became hooked again! These apps are like drugs and this is one of my favorites to take
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a fun game. It was challenging but not too hard. Took a little bit to complete each floor.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|At first I didn't think this game was real. So I saw it in the app store, tried it out then got it. Hahaha it's so fun and gets hard but addicting all at the same time! Yeah it's a stupid concept but hey it works out well!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game. I'm glad there was an offer for 110 free kindle coins with it or I wouldn't of got it or seen it. I just don't like the sea trade and the missions that must have sea trade. I don't have the money to buy crowns or coins. I also like the new update and the Kris Kringle missions. Hope there are more games like this.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|It's basis get gold get food train your fighters it's super easy no lag enjoy able everyone should be a most
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was amazing!! I absolutely loved it. It is my favorite book, and this is why I am reading it again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app, because it gives the correct answers, gives me negative and positive numbers, let's me use this without WiFi connection, and easy to use for children. This is a great app, use it!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this, incredible unlocks for my ps3 version! You even get a character skin for doin this feedback! Besides all of that, this is an awesome game! I love this game. Awesome tablet game. Better than the version for I-phone. Download if you are a fan of dc comics, bc it's well worth the download.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Part of my ongoing series of reviews about skiffy titles. (That's sci-fi for those of you less nerdy than me. ;) )<br /><br />Okay, so whoa. That cover. Whoa! LOVE. My hubs loved it, too, when I showed it to him.<br /><br />And because I do actually look beyond the cover for the words underneath, this book is broken up into a series of stories that all take place in modern times. I loved how the author used lots of terms like Twitter and Google News. That makes me feel like I could be there, you know? Like it really could be happening right now. I mean, I'm typing using Amazon.<br /><br />The stories themselves are interlinked, and each one is short and sweet and tense, building up to a greater overarching arc. I felt like I was watching it all unfold and wondering when the other shoe would drop.<br /><br />No surprise, but the orgy chapters stood out. Whoa, hot stuff there! The tension between Jasmine and President Ferrari . . . mmm, mmm, mmm! *fans self*<br /><br />And then the twist to all of it! Wow, I did not see THAT coming.<br /><br />And that's just the first story. Go check out the whole thing for yourself!
B002KGEORM|5.0|Sons of Anarchy Season 2 I still need to download the rest of the episodes.  Number 1 on FX  and hope the action and the show keep going in the right direction.  Great Show
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Went through this emotional roller coaster of a book slowly, deliberately. It's heavy and sad and true. I don't recall crying so much while reading - yes, I was affected and was reminded of how we tend to neglect or take others' struggles for granted. I know what Hannah Baker went through. Beautifully written and thought-provoking. Pick up or download a copy now.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn part 2 and Book four was beautiful and exciting.  I loved it when they all came together to save the baby.  I thought at the end when we all thought the fight had happened and then what happened was such a surprise.  I had read he book but forgot that part when the movie came out.  You all did such a great job and stephanie Meyers should be proud.  Now I hope and pray you do the same thing with immortal instuments.  Please make it a phenonom like you did twilight; I know you can.  Carrisa and stepanie get together and producers you can do it.  You loving fan Lori L McMaster
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book I have ever enjoyed. I<br />t was a thriller a romance a comedy and a sad novel also packed in one awesome book!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really good app. Love the large numbers for people with poor eyesight. I use this every time I need to do some quick math.
B00BB8T9FC|3.0|Not a bad movie, but not exactly exciting.  Typical story of boy feels restless and despite being needed feels the need to go off on his own and learn something.  Boy does that but then realizes he is happy at home and goes home.  Yay.
0143113100|5.0|Book came within a few days and was in excellent condition.  This book gives fascinating examples of how the human mind is capable of adapting to overcome serious handicaps.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I have a lot of feels about this book.<br /><br />There's a lot that could be said about the portrayal of fandom in this book, and the intricacies of weaving in of Simon Snow's story, and the parallels, and etc. So I'll just say that it's awesome, and leave that at that.<br /><br />But what really struck me about this book is the realistic portrayal of social anxiety and first romance. Eleanor & Park reminded me so much of what it felt to be in love at fifteen, and Fangirl reminds me what it felt like to be in love in college. I think that a lot of people will relate to Cath's character, particularly as a type of protagonist that we don't see very often.<br /><br />Also do a search for &#34;pumpkin mocha breve&#34; on Tumblr. :)
B0081SRJSY|1.0|Unfortunately this game is not formated for the Motorola Droid Ultra. You can't access the accept/cancel buttons nor see half the tile.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|I can give my hearty endorsement for this show in general (seriously, it's amazing, and if you haven't seen it yet and getting this DVD set is how you plan to do that, BUY IT NOW), but I can also say that buying the set is totally worth it because there are some seriously awesome special features.<br /><br />First, there's an unaired episode (what?! awesome), as well as &#34;producer's cuts&#34; of several more. After watching them I can't say for sure what's different, but I'll take their word for it.<br /><br />There are also a number of featurettes, the coolest by far being the one about food. And there are commentaries by the writer, director, and Hugh for the first and last episodes that are really worth a listen. It's clear from all the extras that everyone involved in this show really believes in it.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|This mixer is awesome. I use it for my studio recording and live gigs. It is perfect. I only gave it 4 stars because it lacks a power button and it would have been nice if it had more XLR Inputs. other than that it is awesome
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I actually found this book really entertaining... 3.5 stars maybe? Definitely better than average, but it had some issues that make me reluctant to recommend it too highly. Though to be fair, I think some of the problems were exacerbated by Wil Wheaton's narration, since I listened to the book on audio.<br /><br />The awesome - It's HILARIOUS. Scalzi's strength is definitely his humor. It's also a very clever idea (though at times seems too enamored with its own cleverness), and fans of Star Trek or similar science fiction shows will probably find the meta really delightful. I did!<br /><br />The not-as-awesome - At times the plot goes from meta to meta on top of meta on top of meta, which gets a little... odd. There are places where it seems more like a philosophy essay than a novel. Again, the concept is really clever, so I didn't mind this so much, but sometimes it felt forced, like the characters were having deep conversations that they wouldn't really have, just for the sake of imparting some deep thoughts to the reading.<br /><br />The bad that might have been worse because of the narration - The only other books I've read by Scalzi are Old Man's War and sequels, and I don't remember having a huge overabundance of dialogue attribution, so I'm not sure if I just noticed it a lot more because I was listening to it instead of reading it. On a page, all of the &#34;saids&#34; kind of drift away, but when you're listening to it, it starts to get REALLY annoying after a while. Especially since Scalzi's writing is really, really dialogue-heavy - he doesn't do a lot of description or scene setting, and so most of the book is conversations between characters. I think this might be one of the reasons the book is so short - because really, a LOT happens, it's just not slowed down by description. (Which some people may like!) Also, I didn't get a real sense for the different personalities of the characters, which again, may have been made worse by the narration since Wheaton reads all of the characters as sounding pretty much exactly the same.<br /><br />In sum: I did like the book, I'm glad I read it, but I wouldn't recommend listening to it in audio. And it should be a SUPER fast read, so with that in mind, definitely worth a look.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I absolutely HATE all the advertisments!!!!!!!!!!!!  I only want to see ads for those products/subjects I &#34;LIKE&#34;.  Even the games are inundated with ads.  HATE!  HATE! HATE!
0307913147|5.0|This is not the book for everyone, but boy, was it the book for me. I'm actually kind of amazed I didn't hear about it earlier, but it must have fallen through my cracks.<br /><br />I was totally hooked from the initial premise. Keep these things in mind about me: (1) I love love YA; (2) I love old video game nostalgia; (3) I was a kid in the 80s; (3) I found Steve Jobs' biography seriously engaging; and (4) I've been wondering WHERE'S ALL THE CYBERPUNK YA? for a while now. To me, this book was sort of like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meets Snow Crash meets The Pirates of Silicon Valley.<br /><br />I've actually gotten into discussions with people about whether this book should be considered YA or not, but I put it into that category because of the age of the protagonist, some of the themes, and the fact that YALSA gave it an award. However, there's no doubt that it would be enjoyed by people of all ages. And probably MORE by older people who see it as nostalgia porn.<br /><br />A note on the audiobook: Honestly, I kind of hated Wil Wheaton's narration of Redshirts, so I almost didn't pick this up in audio, but I found that it was MUCH better here. I think he did a great job. And I was so hooked on this book that I - seriously - I spent a couple of hours cleaning my house just so I had an excuse to finish listening to it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun. Get it. I now am playing it ALL the time.<br />You get to get new guns by killing all sorts of things. At first it is really easy and gives you directions. After you play it for a while it lets you go free. You also get bumped up levels. You unlock a new tournament after a couple of rounds.
1250012570|5.0|This is a beautiful, beautiful book.<br /><br />I remember what it was like to be fifteen and think I was in love, and to be sixteen and BE in love. I don't read much contemporary YA or YA that focuses on romance, so I don't have much to compare this to, but I don't think I've ever read anything that captures that feeling as I remember it so well.<br /><br />I read this book in a day. I can't remember the first time I've ever been unable to put down a romance.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|Action packed and entertaining as the first Indy movie. Kate Capshaw was excellent as Willie Scot, but her character was too much of a contrast to Karen Allen's, Marion Ravenwood for me. Her cheeky  tomboy character suited Indy better. Otherwise a top movie.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book. LOVED.<br /><br />I went into it a bit wary because of the hype - I'd heard so much about it, so many GOOD things, that I was afraid my expectations were too high. In the end, my expectations WERE high, but the book met them, if not quite in the ways I thought.<br /><br />I saw Erin Morgenstern say on Twitter and in interviews many times (to the point where she started to sound annoyed, but I don't blame her) that the book is neither YA nor a series, despite how it has been portrayed in some reviews/stories. Both of these things is true. It is not YA, though a teen would certainly enjoy it since it's not like teens read nothing but YA (or that adults DON'T read YA). And to me, it utterly stands alone. I can't even see where a sequel would go, with the caveat that there is such a beautiful world here that it could be explored in perhaps entirely different stories. What I would like to see more than a sequel would be short stories, honestly.<br /><br />Because it is truly the world in this book that is magnificent - not the &#34;world&#34; at large as in Harry Potter or Dresden Files or other books with complicated mechanics of magic, but instead the microcosm of the circus that is painted so beautiful. In all honesty the characters fell much flatter for me than I would typically tolerate in my fiction, but I came to realize that they were really playing second fiddle to the setting as the protagonist.<br /><br />My one serious complaint would be that the time jumping makes it difficult to follow - a problem that was exacerbated by the fact that I was listening to the book on audio and couldn't flip back to see how much time had passed, what time period I was in, etc. For that reason, even though the narration is beautifully done by Jim Dale, I might recommend reading it in hardcopy.<br /><br />Though reviews liked to compare the book to Harry Potter, it reminds me much more in feel if to anything, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. It's very adult (interms of maturity, not theme) and very Victorian. The book picks up momentum as it goes along, not unlike a train, and all of the loose ends begin to tie together at the end masterfully.<br /><br />Don't get scared away by the hype - read this because it's gorgeous.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|What a useless little device.  Its really nothing more than a glorified Youtube player.  If you are tech-savvy you probably already have a smart internet-connected TV or a Roku or a laptop with HDMI output, all of which do way more than this guy.  You can &#34;throw&#34; Youtube from your computer to your TV but that's about it.  Oh...and it does Netflix but not if you're running Linux ('cause Netflix refuses to support Linux on philosophical grounds...but that's another tale.)  I didn't test Netflix since we're a Linux household, but I'd expect it works fine.  But again, there are so many other ways to watch Netflix who needs an extra dongle.  By the time you click your remote to select this HDMI device, you could have selected the native Netflix app on the TV or cranked up your Roku.  It does Google Play Movies as well as Google Play Music but this device doesn't add any functionality.  My Google Music connects via bluetooth directly to my sound system.  Why would I want to run the TV just so I can throw music from my phone or computer to the TV and then back through the sound system.<br /><br />Lastly and this is no big deal, but some really smart programmers figured out how to root the Chromecast within days of its release.  They added all kinds of functionality but Google quickly found a way to re-handicap its device forcing an automatic &#34;upgrade&#34; as soon as it powers up the first time.  This blocked the root exploit.  So rather than create a device and let smart people all over the world figure out how to make it do the coolest things, they chose to prevent its real use by keeping it handicapped.<br /><br />So buy this if you really have no way to watch Netflix on your TV.  Or if you want to buy movies from Google Play.  Or just can't get enough Youtube.  (As if....)<br /><br />Google continues to prove its not in the business of creating new and innovative hardware or delivering content in new ways.  Its about collecting information and selling it.<br/><br />This thing didn't add anything to my technology experience.  Thanks to Amazon for accepting a return.
0385743564|3.0|I did not in the end enjoy this book all that much, though I don't think that it's a bad book--simply not to my tastes. I read a lot of both adult and YA, and to me this felt a bit like an adult book with some pasted on YA elements. However, the world is interesting and very well drawn, and I quite liked some of the reveals at the end. Throughout this book my eyes glazed over at the many descriptions of weaponry--though again, my tastes. I think that this is what those who use such distinctions would call &#34;boy YA&#34; because of those kinds of elements, and it's also very light on romance (which is good, because I didn't find the romance all that compelling). I can think of people that I would recommend this book to who would like it very much, however, and I suspect that Sanderson's adult fans might be pleasantly surprised even if they're concerned about it being a YA book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have played this game for 2 years and I love it. Nice to be able to play on my kindle. Try it you will like it.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Considering I'm a social computing researcher, sometimes I wasn't sure if this was fact or fiction. :) And despite many places where the narrative dragged or was pedantic, I found it hard to put down. Eggers does a good job of slowly building up the world so that it starts out seeming very much like our own and then suddenly it's more like a dystopia and you're not even sure how that happened!<br /><br />A must read for anyone interested in issues of privacy in the age of social media.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Not only fun but very entertaining. I keep returning over and over to expand my territory and create more things.  It is very addictive.  The most fun I have had in ages and it was free.
B009NY43NY|2.0|My general dislike for this book I think was somewhat different than a lot of complaints - I don't really care that much about who Sookie did or did not end up with romantically. But the problem is that the plot of this book was just... not good. Of the two completely separate conflicts, both had extremely extremely thin motivations for the antagonists to the point where it barely made sense, and both had anti-climactic endings. Sadly, the poorest book in the series - however, I did still enjoy the series as a whole and I'm glad I read it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|SO SO GOOD! Very funny. And I love Tina Fey, but I think even if I didn't know who she was I would like this book. I can't wait until she writes another one.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I very much did not know what to expect going into this book, but I was impressed by just the first few pages. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, but it was never the writing itself that enthralled me, but rather the plotting and the characters. Within a few pages of The Casual Vacancy there were several turns of phrases where I sat back and thought, &#34;Wow. Wow, she's a really good writer.&#34;<br /><br />I can see why this book isn't for everyone - it is, more than anything else, a character study. It just so happens that that is one of my very favorite types of books. WHAT is happening isn't so important as who it is happening to, and how all of these people interconnect. And the small English town of Pagford is a perfect setting for that kind of intricate web.<br /><br />And what is really impressive to me is that every single character is a shade of gray. She accomplishes this with shifting points of view constantly, which usually is dizzying, but she handles deftly. The characters who seem truly horrible by all of their behavior, when we get into their heads they are... well, still kind of horrible, but you at least see how they're real people with real motivations. There isn't a hero in this book. Isn't a 100% likeable character anymore than there is a 100% unlikeable character (though some come close). I honestly didn't know who I was rooting for, or even if that was an appropriate thing to be doing.<br /><br />People who read this book with any kind of expectations based on Harry Potter will be sorely disappointed. But Rowling has gained even more of my respect, and I think this book is a triumph.
067144901X|5.0|Very cute short book. My daughet loves it. And we make all the animal sounds to add to the fun.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I'd heard very good things about Cinder from various sources, and I am also always pleased to pick up books from former fan fiction writers, so I was looking forward to this one - it didn't disappoint!<br /><br />I found the world original, and protagonist compelling, and the plot nicely woven.<br /><br />My only major complaint is that though there's some good worldbuilding here, a lot of it isn't explained, which makes some of the story seem poorly drawn. A lot of YA dystopia in particular suffers from a lack of &#34;how did we get here?&#34; and I see that problem here. However, I'm willing to give the author some rope on this one because I know that there are more books coming, and that she wrote some of them simultaneously or in quick succession - i.e., the origin stories of this world could be coming later.<br /><br />Also, the plot twist is painfully obvious by about a chapter in - but I'm just going to assume that's purposefully. Like Hitchcock's bomb under the table. :)<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to future books!
006202406X|2.0|When I first began to read this series, I was engrossed and fascinated by the world of the factions and the characters.  They were original and exciting.  This book did not capture my interest as well as the other books in this series.  I felt the plot took a twist toward the cliche.<br /><br />The ending was disappointing but I understood the need for it to happen that way.  I just wish the entire book went in a different direction that didn't seem so predictable.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|4.5 stars. I don't know what it is about this series, but once I start a new book I can't put it down. It's addictive, and I am very drawn into the world of Ana and Christian. I have seen many reviews that have commented about the writing and honestly I think it's fine. It's not a literary masterpiece, but it's written well enough that I am enjoying it. Sometimes the word choice makes me roll my eyes, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't take away from my reading.<br /><br />This book has a bit more substance in the plot than the first book. I keep forgetting this pair has only been together a matter of weeks since their relationship moves so fast. I don't find myself bothered by that, though, because it's clear they are crazy about each other (and maybe a little crazy in general, but that's okay, too). Ana does get on my nerves a bit in this one with her emotions bouncing back and forth like a pinball machine. I kept yelling &#34;Get a grip, woman!&#34; at her in my head. I do understand her trepidation to a degree, though, and I'm glad she finally confides in Christian about how she doesn't understand what he sees in her. Her lack of self-confidence is frustrating at times.<br /><br />The changes we see in Christian in this book are wonderful, and you have to hand it to a guy who is willing to dramatically change himself and his lifestyle for the woman is loves. Yes, he is controlling and possessive, but only insomuch as he wants to make Ana happy and build a life with her. I don't think there is a side of him that I don't love. I applaud Ana for being willing to compromise with him and take his needs into consideration as they move forward in their relationship. As much as Ana drives me nuts sometimes, she is so good for Christian and I love them together. I will also never tire of their bantering email conversations.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I am an avid reader.  I added this app to my Kindle so that if I am reading a book and don't know the meaning of a word, I don't have to stop and locate a dictionary; I can open the app and get my answer.  It's essential to anyone who wants to know how to spell a word as well as use it in the correct context.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent story. Well written plot and characters. It definitely keeps you guessing, and the struggle of mankind in this bleak future makes for a strong story.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Disappointed that I reached the end.  This book is a true gem.  An inspiration for self-reflection.  Cannot say enough how much I enjoyed this book.  Thank you for this.
B0083Z614S|5.0|What took me so long to read this book?  I don't know. It must be a classic. It's absolutely wonderful.
0385737955|3.0|Having read James Dashner's \\"The Maze Runner\\", I would give it between 3 and 4 of 5 stars. This science fiction novel is based in a future dystopian world in a place called \\"the glade\\", a village-type area surrounded by a giant unsolvable maze lurking with mysterious lethal creatures, the Grievers. All the inhabitants of the glade are about teen-aged children with no recollection of their previous lives. The story follows Thomas along with his friends including Teresa, Chuck, and Minho as things begin to change in the glade after Thomas arrives.<br />  The aspect of this book that kept me reading was its plot which was far from predictable and full of twists and mysteries. The character development and overall writing were somewhat shallow but acceptable for young readers like myself - just don't go into this book looking for a deep thought provoking novel. It is about 375 pages but a quick read due to its easily comprehendible style.<br />  Overall, I would definitely recommend this book but I think it would be enjoyed by younger readers around middle-school age. I would not recommend this to anyone much younger because it does include some semi-violent scenes and could be found a bit scary but anyone who enjoyed books like The Hunger Games and the Percy Jackson series I think would like The Maze Runner. I am looking forward reading more of James Dashner's books including the rest of the Maze Runner series and seeing the motion picture for it in 2014.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I can't wait to give it to my husband he is  a huge fan for the show so this will be the icing of the cake for him to have..All do it looks smaller than I thought but still looks great
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Enjoyable and not to difficult.  Keeps things light to where it moves at at steady pace.  Graphics are ok.  Some items are easy to spot and some aren't.
0385341008|5.0|Unusually written, primarily by using letters written by many characters in the book between the main character, the story unravels in a charming, historic and captivating way.  I so enjoyed this book that I purchased another for my mother who lived through WWII and knew would enjoy it.  I recommend it to everyone I know reads.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really love this game.  at first I was like omega.  pretty hard.  but then I got it.  its the perfect brain teaser and cant wait for more...
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I was so excited to find this app and it doesn't disappoint at all.  It's so fun and I invited a few of my friends to make it even more fun. Great app and it works fine for the most part. You won't be disappointed at all. I have my husband hooked now.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I got a few chuckles out of the movie, but I would not recommend this movie.  I normally have no problem with movies filled with nudity and foul language, but I thought this movie was just over the top in foul language.  In addition, the plot was predictable.  I feel like I wasted a couple hours of my life on watching this movie.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|Love the movie--- love the end.  I think it is one of Cary Grant's best, and that is saying a lot!  Right up there with A Christmas Carol for Christmas holiday favorites.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have seen every James Bond movie, and I think this one is the best.  If you have a good subwoofer, the sound track will give it a great workout.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|This is just the best version of a Jane Austen Classic.  This version of Pride and Prejudice is simply timeless!
B0077ATSZE|5.0|This movie was surprisingly good.  It was a good story with a nice ending.  Not a movie I would have been drawn to the theatre to see, but really worth watching.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Great follow up to Pillars.  Amazing books.  Pillars is better.  World Without End is fabulous, and Ken's use of the plague, while cool and useful, gave him an easier route than he had paving the road on Pillars.  Just exceptional writing.
B00CLL1UY6|3.0|I bought this book because of the reviews. I didn't pay close enough attention to realize that it was a part of a series, but that didn't seem to matter much. The nicest way I can say how I found this story is that I slogged through it. It was slow, yet oddly un-detailed. There was very little dialog. No character was likable. In all, sheer determination is what got me through this textbook-like novel. The ending was abrupt and disappointing. Even the great romances were meh. Plus, it was riddled with grammar errors and outright typos. I have no desire to read the rest of the series.<br /><br />So, why did I give it three stars? First of all, for the history lesson. The author obviously did his homework. Second, for the POV. It was an interesting and rare look into the other side and how they saw the Evil Allies. If only it had been written more dynamically.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been playing for years now and I can't tell you how much I recommend this game! Its way worth the money to get it.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I loved this series even better than Fifty Shades!  My sister has been telling me to read these books for 6 months but I had no time.  Finally I sat down, and in 2 days I had all 3 books read,  I couldn't even sleep because I didn't want to put the book down.  I can't wait until the next book is out, I'll reread these books over again.  Great job!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is an excellently written and wonderfully acted dramatic series with a contiuing story line while each episode stands on it's own. The series is in it's fourth year and we are enjoying the journey as we catch up. We believe the show gets better with each episode!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Flexible arm which I use to hold a monitor. I use the latter for a dual-screen setup with my laptop.
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|Good scary movie.  Worth watching and interesting since it's based on historical story.  Saw it in theater first and then purchased dvd.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book after I watched the movie. We saw the various genres being played out by great actors during the film. Once I read the book and understood the structure of the novel (a series of shorter stories tied together by time), I was even more impressed. Well written with excellent themes for discussion with friends.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|i think that this game is great, tons of fun. but, when you finish a game, do not try to select rematch, you should instead just start a new game. the game actually takes your tokens for the rematch even if you are unable to play. so then you have to spend two more tokens in order to start a new one. and with the amount of tokens you get, wasting two each game seriously cuts the number of times you can play.

B003TNM2K6|5.0|This movie is just enough scary with a lot of suspense. My husband and I love this re-make of the original and the ending is ironic.  Love this movie!
B0017HMF6W|4.0|Love the film but feel like the presentation of this set for a 50th anniversary package could have been better.  Why?  There are a few extras, there's a nice book built in to the set and the film looks good.  It just seems like one of Hitchcock's better films (not his best) deserved better treatment.  Not knowing what might be available for other extras makes it difficult to say what else should be here.  Maybe a more formal package with a separate booklet (sort of like the Criterion Collections series of films).  Maybe  a few outtakes if available.<br /><br />The movie itself, while not my personal favorite Hitchcock, holds up nicely because it looks so good.  Cary Grant is excellent in his role as the ad man suddenly faced with disaster due to a case of mistaken identity.  The crop dusting sequence is top notch and the fight at Mt. Rushmore is well done though the segment still remains, to me at least, not the best use of effects.<br /><br />A set worth buying, especially if you haven't experienced North by Northwest yet.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|The game itself is great, but unfortunately the kindle fire the fastest update would not load correctly causing me to loose all stats. So even though I had completed level 6 and was ranked top 1 0/0 all lost. Nobody wants to start over again....
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This may be sacrilege for long time fans but the folks who put this Blu-ray set together did a great job.  The special effects upgrade may turn off these fans who appreciate the original look of the Enterprise but I found them to be wonderfully done with just enough effects to improve the quality without turning them into Star Wars.  There's a more modern look, yes, but they also have a feel of the 60's - as if someone back then was much more skilled than others (kind of like the Dykstra of 2001) and took some time to adapt existing technology to create a realistic image.<br /><br />The stories themselves still hold up to a point though the ones I thought were bad then are still bad today - they just look better.  There's a nice extra (among others) that shows how they upgraded the images and inserted the new effects.<br /><br />A good addition to anyone Star Trek fan's collection.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I bought this for a friend for Christmas, he loves this movie. This actually comes with a cook book ( no I didn't get the opportunity to see it). Cover on this DVD is very well done, great colors.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It was very easy to download and then install.  The prompts are easy to follow, and then it's just a matter of finding books that you like and sending them to (in my case) your tablet or phone
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of the best children's books my daughters and I have ever read. We are a part of a book club with 5th and 6th graders and the response to this book was beautiful. The conversations we were able to have was amazing!
159463176X|1.0|Quite the disappointment. His first two books I loved and this one fell short of what I had expected. Perhaps his next will redeem himself to me
B00DQZT5ZM|2.0|I ordered this case when there weren't many options for the 8.9 inch HDX. There are now, so I strongly suggest you keep looking.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Color: better than expected. I was a little concerned that it would look bland and washed out, but it doesn't.<br /><br />- Fit: the plastic portion snaps snuggly in place, and it doesn't obstruct any buttons, speakers, or ports.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Flimsy material: this is pretty much the source of all my complaints, so it is a very big con for me.  First, when propped in landscape mode, the material is insufficient to fully support the kindle. I found it takes a little fiddling to get it to stay up, and even then I think it leans too far back. I've had cases for my other kindles that had similar designs, but I've never had a problem like this. Second, when I fold over the case to hold my kindle in portrait mode, the case feels very awkward.  Again, the flimsy material causes problems because it does not fold back neatly.<br /><br />- Price: I paid $45 for my case. That is ridiculously high for the quality of this case. I think a fair price would be at least half of that.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Movie was pretty good, not sure how the book is- probably better. They should explain things in the movie a little better, instead of leaving you in the dark on why all the hunger games stuff exists...
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|This is an excellent publication. It is easy to read and from my perspective it is written in a warm, conversational style. In my opinion, On Writing is a masterpiece.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Awesome Movie! This is a movie for the whole family. It's both visually stunning with a great story line! Heartwarming.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I'm goad I got this game when it was the free app of the day cause its really neat to play! it challenge my brain and its like you do a victory dance when you get it right! love it! plus I love showing up my dad in this game lol
B007R21JJK|1.0|One year later, the two ram slots nearest the CPU are dead.  If any stick of RAM is plugged into either of those two slots, it will not POST.  Ran fine for the first year, but I really expected it to last longer than this.  Tried upating the BIOS and everything, no dice.  Steer clear of this board.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Loved the book. Very realistic and inspirational. I have already begun incorporating the daily practice into my life. Great story teller.
B000UDNBQW|3.0|I purchased this book to read for my book club. It is well written and has good character development. There are unanswered questions in my mind as to the setting and the history of the conflict that the characters are involved in that the author does not address.  This is not a well known, to me, period of history an it would have been helpful in understanding of the characters.
B000A5044C|5.0|Sad subject but a great movie. Makes me really appreciate the life I am living and how others can have a much harder life.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love the game, very fun to play. However, it seems extremely difficult to win enough credits to keep playing. I purchased 500 credits, played for 2 hours, and am out already. That's not good business. It's almost like they try to make you pay to be able to play for any length of time. Also, you can add a ton of friends that can send credits as gifts, but I'm only able to pick up 5 every 12 hours, which is ridiculous.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Was on the fence on downloading this app sure glad I did ,this game is quite addictive ,great looking graphics,this game won't disappoint.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|My 9 year old son plays this game and it's one if his very favorites but he also loves the movie.
0545101425|5.0|Fantastic book and series.  My grandchildren were reading it and we wanted to discuss it with them, so we bought an audio book to listen to on our long drive to their house.  The series is violent with children killing other children, so be aware of this with young children.  I would not give it to children under 12 without adult supervision.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Year after year, this is the hands down favorite holiday movie.  My kids are all adults, but we can barely clear the dishes from Christmas Eve dinner before everybody is gathered around singing along.
B008PWN0I4|4.0|Works very well with my 6th Gen iPod 160GB. This is a great stop gap until Apple will finally, if ever, release a high capacity iPod touch. The sound quality is money!<br /><br />It would be perfect but for some reason my new Sol Republic Air Track headphones can't control it (stop, pause, fast forward, & skip). I have a feeling it could be using aptX and can't use the controls when in that mode. Just a guess. Never the less not the end.<br /><br />One thing I have noticed is it does drain the iPod battery quicker, though that is to be expected.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The clues for the most part were out in the open and are easy to find for those who are observant.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Just for the reference for possible future and past versions of this knife: I purchased this knife on November 28th, 2013.<br /><br />First, a few positive impressions:<br /><br />+1. The knife doesn't feel as heavy in my hand as I anticipated from the numerous reviews of other customers.<br />(From my point of view/need - I would say there's a plenty of room for weight increase in order to gain - let's say - an additional inch in blade length. That's the sacrifice I'd be glad to make. If this thing had the blade an inch or an inch and a half longer while retaining this thickness and blade width - it would be \\"just what I wanted\\" instead of \\"closest one to what I wanted\\").<br /><br />+2. The design is really nice - plain, uncomplicated, robust and straightforward. When I say \\"nice design\\" I refer to usefulness of the knife rather then it's esthetic appealing (which is, btw, also very nice for my taste).<br /><br />+3. Despite it's weight it's also enough compact to be the knife of choice even for less demanding outdoor/camping/survival/hunting activities where you would usually carry some smaller/lighter/thinner knives.<br /><br />Now, this knife isn't exactly the best performer in any single one of all \\"rational\\" activities you usually do on the field while camping, surviving, hunting, hiking... Why did I buy it then?<br />Well, I think it's one of the best for the price in those \\"irrational\\" things like \\"giving a piece to your mind\\".<br />I wanted to have a single tool that I can take on any trip (even on a one day not_far_out_of_town easy hike) and not to feel unrest in the back of my mind for \\"not taking the ax just in case that.....(whatever scares you that might happen unpredictably)\\".<br />With this knife I can do just that - have a one (relatively lightweight) tool that you can use to cut, slice, dig, break rock and bones, hit, scratch, drill, bend, chop, baton, use it as a rope hook, nail it in something and so on. Like I said - it's far from ideal for anyof this tasks alone, but there aren't many others knives which can do so much without giving you concerns about it's endurance for any of those jobs.<br /><br />Besides all that, even if your life is not depending on abusing your knife to it's limits - this fella's cheap enough to use it that way whenever you want because there isn't any high-price-tag that will make you to hesitate of using your knife as you should do - as a simple all-around tool rather than as an expensive toy.<br /><br />Now, the dark side of the Moon. First, two serious cons:<br /><br />-1. My knife came with the blade slightly bent to the left, right out of the box.<br />I wasn't intentionally looking for the imperfections, but since I noticed that with my bare eyes just by holding it in my hands for a few seconds you can assume that it isn't something \\"negligible\\" what you could only spot by careful inspection and comparing it against the straight ruler or something similar. In fact, when I align the ruler edge against the base of the spin of the blade (approximately. 1/3 of the blade length on the convex side) - the tip of the blade is 2.5-3 mm away of the upper ruler edge. When I press the ruler edge against opposite side of the blade (on the concave side), the spin of the blade deflects from the middle of the ruler edge for abut 1-1.5 mm.<br />It doesn't sound big in \\"numbers\\", but is very unpleasant sight for the eye.<br />Is there anything looking poorer than the bent knife? And right out of the box?<br /><br />-2. The grinds on the blade were different in width on left and right side. The one was 3mm wider than the other. That means that the blade is not symmetrical on the left and right sides. The easiest way to visualize this is to imagine that the flat, upper part of the blade (spin) is 3mm wider on one side than on the other.<br />I'm not sure if this is considered \\"normal\\" or \\"acceptable\\", but I haven't seen such blade dis-symmetries on any other knives I have, even the ones comperable in price to this one, or even cheaper.<br /><br />Minor cons:<br /><br />-3. The black coat on the blade is somewhat coarse: it feels almost like a lower-grit sandpaper. I have a few knives with some black coating but they're silk smooth in comparison with this one. Like I said - almost like a sandpaper. Not sure if this is good or bad since I haven't tested it yet.<br /><br />-4. Ka-Bar logo is not hard-stamped onto steel but rather just printed on the black coating. It will wear out sooner or later (or maybe you will intentionally strip the coating if you don't like it or if you want to customize the knife, like many do).<br />Manufacturers logo is of not much significance to me, but I know there are people who care, so it's maybe ok to let them know what to expect with newer purchases.<br /><br />-5. Sheets are not spectacular bat neither bad: the hanging-strap could be stronger and better balanced, the button-locking secure-belt is almost impossible to lock around the knife handle with just one hand. However, taking into account the price of the knife - they are pretty ok for that price, and there's a lot of space to customize it for yourself.<br />I can pull out the knife out of sheets with one hand (while pushing the sheets in opposite direction with a thumb) without problems, and I like the fact that the sheets are holding the knife decently firm. I don't know what kind of people can't pull this knife out of sheets single handed, but if there are any - maybe they're not quite fit for the tasks/situations this knife is intended for.<br /><br />So, I contacted the manufacturer regarding the two critical issues I mentioned above and I'm waiting for response.<br />If they confirm that my knife is just \\"a black sheep\\" that somehow slipped the Ka-Bar quality control by some unfortunate chain of events - then I would just replace this one through amazon. If the new one I receive is free of those two major imperfections - I would give this knife a 5-star rating.<br />(If the blade was an inch longer - I would give this knife 6-star if possible :)<br /><br />On the other hand, if the above mentioned issues are within standard specs of the Ka-Bar production then I would still give it two stars, because you can still take a hammer and straighten it yourself and have a decent peace of steel for a nice price. And for an unsymmetrical grind of the blade - I wouldn't bother fixing it (to much delicate work to do it right), would just leave it as it is.<br /><br />I'll update this review after I receive answer from Ka-Bar. I hope they won't answer with the offer/request to send the knife to them for inspection because I sent them the photos of the knife against the ruler, where you can clearly see all what I was writing about.<br /><br />Thanks for your attention. Sorry for somewhat cumbersome text, English is not my nature language.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Like I said, I've contacted the Ka-Bar regarding the bent blade and uneven grind. Their response was fairly quick (a day or two), and this is what they told me (a quote from the email):<br /><br />\\"... the steel we receive from our steel manufacturer comes cold rolled however we do not grind the flat panels. KA-BAR does this to keep manufacturing costs down and to create an overall inexpensive well-made product for the consumer. The grind is within manufacturing specifications, and does not affect the actual performance.<br /><br />However, KA-BAR's Return's department is willing to handpick a BK2 that is straighter without the curvature. Please send back your BK2 to KA-BAR's facilities at the address below and we would be happy to assist you with this... \\"<br /><br />So, it seems that mentioned imperfections are still within manufacturing specifications (at least the grinding).<br />However, I wanted to see if that's the case with other knives, so I returned the knife to Amazon and ordered a new one, also from Amazon (Amazon was great for this - no problems whatsoever).<br />The new one I got was perfectly straight and the blade was symmetric.<br />Now, I'm very satisfied :)<br /><br />So, I'm giving it five stars for the second knife I got and for overall satisfaction both with Amazon and Ka-Bar service.

B00FGFVMGA|4.0|A lot of fun to play.  I like how there are hints that you can access without having to pay extra.  If it was longer, it would have a higher rating.

B00G2KV92U|3.0|I will say that this hurts me to write this review. I have been a Boston fan since I was a kid, listening to my older brother's cassettes of Boston-Boston and Don't Look Back until they began to wear out. I have seen them live in concert (4 times in total) during the Delp era and after with Sweet and DeCarlo and with the various musicians that have filled the live in concert spots (some better than others). People seem to throw out masterpiece and classic a lot these days when it comes to their favorite bands and albums but Boston's first album was one that is Rock Hall worthy with its awesome guitars and rock sound that influenced rock musicians for decades after. Unfortunately for us fans, Scholz has been notoriously difficult to get along with, fighting with the labels and with band mates.<br /><br />And through all that, the wait has gotten longer and longer for us eager fans hoping that a new album would come out. I liked 3rd Stage, Walk On, and even Corporate America, even though I didn't think they reached to the heights of that first Boston album, a tough feat in even the best of circumstances.<br /><br />After hearing that Boston had been working on some new material prior to Delp's death, the fan in me hoped again that Boston would rise out of the ashes and bring something great. And even after the passing of Brad and hearing DeCarlo's ability to sound a bit like him, I continued to hope that with a mix of some of the tracks that Delp had recorded prior and some new stuff that a great album would eventually make it out of Scholz's basement. So I waited and waited and nearly 11 years later, the announcement came that in December, Boston's new album would finally arrive.<br /><br />And so, what do we get after all this time?? 8 songs (some of which don't sound like Boston at all) and 3 remakes from Corporate America and on the BB version another remake from CA. I don't mind doing some different things on an album with some different sounding songs. And I also don't mind reissuing some songs from a previous album (I didn't mean to fall in love is a great song from Corporate America) that you play differently but these should be bonus tracks on a deluxe edition and not part of a standard album. As a huge fan, I will admit I am disappointed after all this time waiting. Even though there were a couple things I didn't like about Corporate America, I didn't feel as let down as I do here.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong as there are moments -- like on `Heaven on Earth' where the band sounds like the Boston of old with Scholz's rocking guitar. But unfortunately those times are few and far between on this album.  After a few listens, this has grown on me a bit but I still expected more.<br /><br />The songs sound simplistic and even the production feels off to me. The vocals -- provided by a rotating cast of singers, including the late Brad Delp -- seem to be poorly mixed as well. For me personally, I absolutely hate the female vocalist (Dahme) in this album. I didn't like the one song she did as a lead in Corporate America and I don't like her vocals now. She is a decent vocalist, but to me, it is not the Boston sound.<br /><br />The album lacks a cohesiveness and seems very unfocused. The vocals by different singers seem to contributes to this, as are the reworked versions of songs from `Corporate America' but even with that, the individual songs themselves seem to be lost.<br /><br />Heaven on Earth is probably my favorite of the album and sounds most like the old Boston.<br /><br />Didn't Mean to Fall in Love - A good song on CA, but I personally couldn't tell any difference on this album and I am not sure why it needed to be remastered.  (Put it as a bonus track, we will listen to it, we promise.)<br /><br />Last Day of School is ok as an instrumental but Boston has done better.<br /><br />Sail Away - with Brad on the vocals is decent but seems unfinished.  Maybe due to Brad's passing.  A good song but could have been much more.<br /><br />If You Were in Love - with Dahme is  better than her effort on the previous album but in my opinion is an example of where Boston strays far away from their sound.<br /><br />Someday and Love Got Away are ok with someday sounding a bit Third Stage-ish.<br /><br />You Gave Up on Love and Someone are again from the previous album and to me aren't different enough to be included as part of the main album.  Again these should be bonus tracks.<br /><br />The Way You Look Tonight  is a decent ballad similar in the vein of Living for you.<br /><br />Te Quiero Mia - Another remake from Corporate America, at least this was at least listed as a bonus track for the album.<br /><br />It seems to me with the loss of Delp and the departure of some of the band mates that have helped the band play live throughout the years (Fran Cosmo's to me is one notable example), Scholz and Boston have lost their way. I expected so much more, but seemingly the fire may be dwindling for the band, which I can understand after losing Delp. But don't tell us that you have for 10 years been working on some classic sounding material and instead give us this. And please don't put Dahme as a lead vocalist on a Boston album. That to me is not Boston either. I can accept that we don't have Delp anymore but give us the rocking sound and good vocals that we fans have come to know and love. Give us a 5 star album and not a 3 or lesser quality one.<br /><br />As a long time fan I can only hope....Well maybe in another 10 years.  We fans miss ya Brad :-(ore.<br /><br />If You Were in Love - with Dahme is  better than her effort on the previous album but in my opinion is an example of where Boston strays far away from their sound.<br /><br />Someday and Love Got Away are ok with someday sounding a bit Third Stage-ish.<br /><br />You Gave Up on Love and Someone are again from the previous album and to me aren't different enough to be included as part of the main album.

B00APJLX8E|3.0|Not the best cartoon I have seen in awhile but ok. Could have been much funnier but it is typical Adam Sandler humor which is more about dumb stuff.  Nothing clever here too much.
B002QYVPI4|4.0|It was a good movie, but it wasn't as genre-changing as I keep hearing. I think that might be because I saw it so far after so many other, newer movies. I have to agree that the special effects show what's possible with old-school technique, and it's really amazing.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I rated it two stars because it's designed to continue to take more and more money from the players.  Each new quest always gets down to one or two moves to win when it ends.  In frustration, you will buy extra time or other bonuses, which turn out to only be good for the single quest alone (learned that the hard way).  I can just imagine how much money they are making with this game as they $.99 you to death.<br /><br />So it is challenging, but you need a lot of patience if you don't want to keep pouring money into it.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I love this movie, it is one of my favourites. I first saw it in pan and scan, and that could never do it justice. Wide screen and blu-ray is the way to go.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was great reading.  I love Jake and all of the characters from A Time To Kill.  It ended way too fast!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Slighltly more to hook-up and connection than expected - based on what I read.  The casting has not been as seamless as suggested in the marketing. Tried to stream a movie once and ultimately stopped becasue the audio was lagging behind the video. It has been OK for use with YouTube and casting a Tab, but other than that not very impressed!! Great price though, but some times you get what you pay for.

B00BEK6Z7M|1.0|Wow,these guys are really going downhill.Horrible book and Corrie Swanson is so annoying and unbelievable that it makes this almost impossible to read.Honestly people,how could anyone read this rubbish and not come to the same conclusion.I had the feeling while reading this that it was written by a novice.This along with the ridiculous scenarios of the last couple Pendergast novels has ended my relationship with these authors.I guess they are getting greedy and trying to write as many books as they came as quickly as they can.Sad.The character Corrie is an idiot who makes so many ridiculously bad decisions that no sane person would ever do.I do not understand how anyone could possibly be entertained by the stupidity of her character and the ridiculous writing in the action scenes.Does there not have to be some semblance of reality here or is this more a fantasy novel?Spoiler coming so stop here if you are going to read it.....one simple example.....in the caves where hundreds of angry rattlesnakes fail to bite the assassin or her in a confined environment.?If you take away Pendergast from the novel,the characters and writing are very low quality and a complete waste of time.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is a writer I am going to follow as she writes her books she opens the mind of her characters so we can look in.  I enjoy the psychological thriller/mystery most of all.  It gets to the nitty gritty of why we humans do what we do-the motive is not generic but becomes tantalizing by the character's psych bread crumbs through the book.  It becomes a puzzle I would love to solve.  Thank you Ms. Flynn, keep on writing.
B0071AKB38|5.0|I love this little sonic orb!  While I'm no audiophile, to my ears this speaker boasts some pretty good sound quality, period, without even taking its size into account.  When you also consider its compactness, this is a pretty impressive little piece of equipment.  The build quality seems pretty good, and it feels solid in the hand.  It's got a nice design, and has a pleasant rubbery matte surface texture.  I use it all the time; to listen to music while cooking, working, or even showering (as far as I know, it's not waterproof - and I wouldn't test it - but I can connect this speaker to my phone or computer, leave that in another room, and place the X-mini on a ledge or windowsill somewhere safe in the bathroom); I use it to give me and my friends something to plug iPods into when we're socializing somewhere without a sound system present; and I use it with my laptop to provide some extra &#34;oomph&#34; to movies, TV shows, or online video that otherwise would have been inaudible.<br /><br />I bought the X-mini both for it's size and quality.  I needed something light and super-compact for traveling, but that wouldn't sacrifice too much in the sound department.  The X-mini fit the bill: so far, I've tossed it in a backpack and dragged it around Europe for 2 months and have taken it across the U.S. to the West Coast without incident.  It easily took the punishment of travel and meshed well with my other electronics, and didn't substantially add to their weight or clutter (something that is always in danger of happening with an assortment of gadgets while traveling).  It was always there to provide that spot of quality sound when I needed it.<br /><br />There are two niggles with the X-mini - the price, which I think is largely deserved when considering the quality, is still a tad expensive.  I bought it for $60, but think maybe $45-$50 might be a bit fairer.<br />Also, while the initial bluetooth setup is a breeze, I experienced minor issues a few times when trying to reconnect on both my phone and my laptop, where I had to delete the X-mini from the listing of remembered devices and reintroduce it.  Also, sometime it seems to only partially connect (or only link up one channel) on bluetooth with my laptop, and I have to disconnect/reconnect until it works.  Minor issues, though, and to be honest I'm not sure if the fault lies in the speaker or my devices (probably the devices).<br /><br />So all-in-all, if you want the smallest, best-sounding bluetooth-capable portable speaker, the X-mini is probably for you!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read all of Khaled Hosseini's novels.  I believe he is a great writer that should be given credit for providing a bridge for a westerner's view into the culture, war, history and character development into the middle east.  I might not be using the correct term but I get so involved in his novels (including this one) that everything else fades away.  I also give alot of credit to Mr. Hosseini for his development of women in his novels, including this one.  Alot of male authors don't have a clue but he does.  The sense of mystery is always present not only in the novel development but also in reading about a different culture.  I hope I am learning as I am reading so I can better understand the world as I see it through his character's eyes.
0140157352|5.0|This is one of the most classic books on negotiation of all time.  Anyone interested in reaching agreements in their lives should read this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham always keeps me on the edge of my seat...I am very analytical by nature and through my career.  It takes alot for an author to keep me looking for the connecting points to figure out the surprise ending and Grisham does it in this book.  He develops his characters well and reveals what he needs at the appropriate time.  He sets the hook for his reader right from the beginning the way it should be in this type of book.  Thank you John Grisham it was a great read.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Really enjoyed as the early Grisham books. Once started could not put it down. Great storytelling, well developed believable characters. Loved it.
B009LRE040|5.0|Dark Knight Rises Movie Review<br /><br />The third installment of the Batman trilogy had a lot of hype to live up to, and the special effects and plot of the Dark Knight Rises lived up to its two predecessors. Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were both well received, thus paving the way for a third and final epic finally. To followers of the trilogy this final movie delivered and was a huge hit. If special effects, action, and superheros are up your alley, The Dark Knight Rises would have you on the edge of your seat no matter if you have seen the previous two movies or not.<br /><br />One of the key factors that makes this movie exceptional is the tremendous cast of return members and new members. Christian Bail once again plays the perfect part of Batman and Bruce Wayne. His personality and character fits this role perfectly and it really shows throughout the film.  Gary Oldman also returns as a familial face in the movie as Commissioner Gordon. His character is a nice contrast of a regular lawkeeper compared to Batman, a vigilante. The two also seem to have a bond that works well on the screen during their few face to face scenes. Anne Hathaway (Catwoman) and Marion Cotillard (Miranda) are nice additions to the cast. Although the idea of Anne Hathaway playing Catwoman in the movie didn’t settle well with many critics, I believe that her superior acting skills definitely adds to this movies outstanding cast. In a series of movies that is traditionally dominated by male actors, it is nice to see a few key women thrown into the mix; they add a personality that simply can not be brought out by a male character. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also introduced to the series; he plays Blake who is made out to be the predecessor of Batman at the end of the movie. Finally two very well known and respected actors return to the screen, Morgan Freeman (Fox) and Michael Caine (Alfred). Neither of them play a crucial role in the movie, but they are important characters, and as many of you will agree, any movie benefits from the presence of Morgan Freeman.<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!SPOILERS!!!!<br />One of the reasons I really love this movie is for the ending. Although the company claims this movie is the end of their take on Batman, the end of this movie sets up perfectly for an installment with Robin (Batman’s partner in crime). Batman risks his life in order to take the atomic bomb over the ocean, and it is never really clear if he is still alive or not. Blake later goes to pick up a package left for him, and we find out his name is Robin. He finds the “Bat Cave” and is made to look like the next savior of Gotham. In addition there are several other interesting bits of information you gain in the last five minutes of the movie. Also, you are reminded of some of the small details revealed earlier in the movie. The end of this movie may not be action packed, but is filled with suspense and emotion, so, for whatever reason, if you are thinking on giving up on the movie, hold out until the end, I promise you will be satisfied.<br /><br />Another aspect of this movie and series in general that I really enjoy is the overall portrayal of Batman and everything associated with Batman. This is not your traditional Batman comic book type of plot, it is more of a modern day Batman movie. Bruce Wayne driving Lamborghini's and the city of Gotham in general display some modern touches to this movie. This movie also takes a step away from traditional Batman villains. After Heath Ledger, the Joker in The Dark Knight, passed away, I think it was a smart play to step away from the Joker in general because no one could match the performance put forth by Heath Ledger in his role playing the Joker. While keeping with the main plot for the entire series, Christopher Nolan (the director) introduces a new villain, Bane. Bane is an interesting villain who you later find out is really nothing more than a puppet.

He had a very hard life, and lost people who were near and dear to him....its  sad. I am glad he turned his life around and found peace in his life. But he never forgot where he came from. He is five stars in my estimation.

B005DOKM9M|5.0|Fine item for the amazon Kindle fire HDX. Light in weight and well made, not honky-tonky. It looks nice for the small price.
B00FR0GT9Y|4.0|I think this is a solid album.  I too am a long time fan of Boston and like their first albums.  I also like the Walk On album tremendously.  With music in general a lot of people who write 1-2 star reviews only want to hear stuff that is like the original albums.  It is hard for bands to replicate their debut albums. I wish Cheap Trick would release their debut album Cheap Trick, In Color, and Heaven Tonight 100 times over too, but that ain't happening and I am not going to slam everything they put out after those albums because of it.<br /><br />I read some criticism on the drumming of this album, okay I get that but I hardly noticed when just listening to the songs.  If I focused on that then okay maybe they sound fishy here and there, but to me it is minor in the whole package.  I suppose a Drummer by trade would be offended by this, but let's focus on the package.<br /><br />My only wish would be that they just stuck with a primary singer across the album or as much as they could have.  I think Tommy DeCarlo does a fantastic job and would have liked to hear his voice across the majority of the songs.  I get the Brad Delp thing where they blended some of his vocals in there, and used his vocals as primary on a few songs and that is welcomed in my opinion, however I think I would have been happier as a fan had they locked DeCarlo in for the majority of the songs and had less \\"guest vocalists\\" to DeCarlo's primary vocals.  This to me would show they were serious about moving forward and possibly putting out something new sooner rather than decades later.  But I know that ain't gonna happen so I am giving 4 stars for a pretty solid album that sticks with the basic Boston feel.<br /><br />Standout songs to me are:  Heaven on Earth, Someday, Someone, Life, Love & Hope<br /><br />A special note on the song Sail Away, I have no idea where this song is coming from it sounds out of place and not at all like a Boston song.  It is somewhat annoying to me and it sounds likea hot mess to which I avoid at all costs.  I would say this song is clearly the worst on this album.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Silly for me to review a timeless classic, nevertheless I'll say that even upon this re-read it brought me to tears. L.M. Alcott was a master at touching the emotions of her audience, not for the sake of manipulation, but to move us.  Also, it's utterly refreshing to read something unsullied; few if any contemporary books are completely wholesome.
B000TGCR38|4.0|Mostly a tense, well acted, believable (in a slightly suspended way) movie. Nice to see the complexities of European society -- they're not all \\"civil or civilized.\\" About midway through the movie, I felt some of the scenes were becoming a bit too cliched, nonetheless, there were enough twists in the end to keep me interested. I had to keep telling myself, \\"I know she survives, because it's her story.\\"

B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Sex and explicit drug abuse scenes that were irrelevant to the plot. The movie made me think about that many times we are in the hands of people we called experts have a desaster in their lives.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|one of my fave it horror movie from when i was a kid.<br /><br />great horror movie buy. i give it a 10 star.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was great but a little sad. The most great and perfect books. And I can not wait fir the moive
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I teared up upon hearing the first track when I played this CD. I've never really experienced something that affects me with so much emotion as when I hear Susan Boyle's voice. Coupled with a wonderful selection of easily recognizable and &#34;sing-along-able&#34; stage hits, this album is a must-have for any Susan Boyle fan or just anybody with an ear for beautiful music.<br /><br />This CD also includes lovely liner notes with each song described by Susan, in her handwriting. She also lets us in on how some of them relate to her life. And being known as a singer who has a need to emotionally connect to every song she sings, you can rest assured that every track is heartfelt and sincere.<br /><br />I love that she gets to do a couple of songs with her idol, Donny Osmond. Good on you, Susan! We, your fans, are really so proud of you! I really hope we hear more of you and continue to be blessed with your beautiful voice in the years to come. Thank you, Susan.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|it's. fun and just cool it gets<br /><br />it's. fun cool and addicting it's. great. so you should get this game and play it
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan Boyle's &#34;Home for Christmas&#34; is the perfect accompaniment to the holiday season. The song selections were not only impeccably chosen but also wonderfully sung by Susan. It's what you listen to on those cold December nights, curling up with a cup of hot cocoa and a blankie, while remembering the real reason why we're celebrating the holidays.<br /><br />Every song here is beautiful, but my favorites would have to be her renditions of &#34;The Christmas Waltz,&#34; &#34;In the Bleak Midwinter,&#34; &#34;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&#34; and &#34;I'll Be Home for Christmas&#34;. Ms. Boyle keeps it traditional, not over-the-top or entirely different from their original versions. She sings each song with such solemnity and heartfelt sincerity. I'd have to admit I get teary often when I hear her sing.<br /><br />Don't forget to add this album to your Christmas collection. You'll be glad you did.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|The CD is fairly OK. Got it on BlackFriday Deal, really cheap. It is also in a cheap shape. But I think is good as with such a price.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|I love it and so do my kids.  We enjoyed it last year and look forward to it again. So cute
B0009VSB06|4.0|I am not sure that this works all that well but my staff uses it and I have not experimented with it and they have found some of our lost dog tags and keys that have been dropped by our house guests on the grounds.
B00GX50BD2|3.0|Terrible adaptation of the book. Read the book it is far better in this case.  Kutcher does alright, but the ending is poor in relation to the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. It keeps your mind locked for a time. The only downside is that you run out of lives too quickly.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Great popcorn movie. No real story, just a good Saturday Morning Cartoon brought to live.  The acting is okay, but nothing to shout about.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|This is a great movie about the power of the human spirit - choosing a goal and putting everything you have into it. This is a movie that came in under the radar - no hype and marketing, just a real good story.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|just a fun movie that is a blast to watch over and over again-with the entire john wayne movie gang. very funny as well. a rip roaring good time.
B005LCECU6|5.0|Excellent recording from the board of the boys in their early days.  Neil just joined them before this tour was recorded.  Excellent!  Geddy really could go high into the stratosphere in those days.  He does a pretty good still today!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Terrific story, but the ending was not satisfying to me. I bought this for a book club and thought the characters were compelling. However, my biggest issue with the book was there were simply too many characters to keep track of in one story. I am also not a fan of stories that start at a certain point, flashback, and then reveal. That is just a pet peeve of mine. I prefer for a story to unfold without knowing a huge plot twist right from the get go. I think it is meant to grab the reader's attention, but I just don't like that style. Regardless, the story and characters stay with you long after the book is complete.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|minor issues when game is loading however no complaints overall. graphics are clean and game plaly is smooth and fun.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. If you enjoy fashion, you'll like this. Meryl Streep's performance is flawless as usual.
B00CHVJODE|3.0|Okay, this was not my favorite animated movie of all time, not even close.  It was watchable, but I doubt I will be sitting down to view it every year like I do with Toy Story or The Incredibles.  Basically, its not a treasure, but a movie you can sit down and see with the kids on some lazy afternoon.<br /><br />The story is set in some mythological Stone Age.  I say mythological because the creatures we see are pretty unrealistic...cute, but unrealistic.  I mean, a tiger-like creature with parrot colors?  Flying birds that eat someone down to the bone in a few seconds?  Plus, the main predator that is hunting this family, of which I never could figure out what kind of creature that was supposed to be.<br /><br />Be that as it may, our family includes the father, Grug, who teaches his wife and kids and the grandma to fear the outside world...due to the fact that so many things want to kill and eat you.  They only go out of the cave to find food, which seemed to involve way more work than the calories would give you energy for.  A cute scene that reminded you of a high stakes football game, with an egg instead of a ball, but it honestly made little sense.  Then it all changes and their life (survival really) changes.<br /><br />Some spoilers below:<br /><br />Again, be that as it may...Eep is a red-haired daughter who is tired of being told what she can't do, because there is little she can do.  She longs for more.  One night, she creeps out of the cave when she sees a light and discovers...FIRE!  Oh, and the guy who discovered it, curiously named...Guy.  Of course, they end up liking each other and Grug isn't happy with that, or the fact that Guy is encouraging his daughter (and family) to leave behind their safe refuge and go out into the world more.  Of course, this decision is taken away from them due to the impending End Of The World (one imagines it has something to do with the break-up of the continents, but that's never really made too clear).  Guy is intenton leading them to this mountain, where he thinks they will be safe?  Or they are supposed to leave the mountain for the Sun?  Again, unclear.  Got the end of the movie and it was still unclear.<br /><br />There are plenty of funny bits along the way, colorful (fantasy) creatures, and the invention of wearing (LIVE!) animals as part of your clothing.  The interaction between Grug and Gran remind you that the strife between mother-in-law-and son-in-law go back to the beginnings...apparently.  Sandy, the younger daughter, is also pretty funny as she hardly talks, mostly growls, and can run down most things and take them out.  The older son is much more like Grug, but not half as smart.  He also discovers the first pet!  The mother, on the other hand, was rather forgettable as a character, sadly.<br /><br />This movie might have been better with more build-up of the characters and an end goal that made more sense.  I did really enjoy their first interaction with fire, though, and the animation was quite well done.  The action scenes were also pretty good and this movie WILL be entertaining enough for the kids, but its not so much for the adults as Toy Story or The Incredibles or even Brave.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great distraction while I am waiting for the second The Room game to come out! Very challenging and entertaining so far. Hope it keeps my interest.
0744014956|5.0|I give this guide 5 stars because I like how it goes thru every mission with tips. The missions are sort of in Chronological order. Meaning main story missions that haven't been unlocked shouldn't be before a mission(or path of missions) already available. This isn't a problem for me, but if you're planing on following this guide mission for mission, you should be able complete them all no problem.<br /><br />In this guide you will find several maps of Los Santos revealing weapon, armor, health and special quest item locations.<br /><br />You will also find a full vehicle/aircraft guide pre GTA update 1.06, which means no bifta or whatever the other two vehicles are. Also, without looking at it I believe the pre-order vehicles (Hotknife/Khamelion/Carbon/Elegy) are not in this guide either.<br /><br />These are all conveniently located at the beginning of the guide so you can get straight into wreaking havoc as soon as you get into the free mode part of story.<br /><br />Many sites online will help you get to 100% completion for this GTA V. But if you got the 22 spare bucks and you don't want to bother searching the web when you can have it all in one, this guide is a great buy.<br /><br />Also I must note that none of the online missions were included, nor is there any online specific information in the guide. At least when I bought this to go with my preorder.
0634049011|1.0|It's not a book for me. I didn't find anything interesting or valuable in the book  -- so can't recommend it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I've played Deer Hunter in the past, but you never know with these Kindle games.  This is a must own! Very easy to get used to, and very addictive.
030759565X|5.0|This cookbook is a pleasure to read and look at, and the recipes are my kind of food--homey and comforting, but fresh and delicious.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I love these types of games but usually lose interest after too many object finds and not enough story. I actually wanted to find out what happened in this one, and made it through to the end. Entertaining and challenging--fun!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the next big thing! The next big thing since iPhone! This changes the whole way we watch online videos. I received the Chromecast today and I am impressed! The setup was a breeze. Been testing with youtube, googleplay movies, and chrome browser for the last couple of hours and everything working as expected! Hopefully more app support and 1080p casting via browser will come in future. Highly recommended. Kudos to Google for making it so affordable. Every home should own one!
B00594XOZU|4.0|The app works exactly like it used to thanks for bringing it back I am so happy yeah yeah yeah
B000GLDOXS|5.0|Gift for my Fiance'..I hope he enjoys it very much!!It's what he asked for..Merry Christmas sweetie&#60;3 I do so hope you enjoy it
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I've had this for 2 years and it is still looking awesome!  The leather-y cover still looks great, but there is some wear on the gold accents- just like you'd expect from a well loved book.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I bought it for my Kindle because it wouldn't charge but it still won't charge so I'm out of luck!
B001TOD92C|4.0|My wife and I watched this together and were favorably impressed with the acting!  Mickey does a great job portraying a aging man realizing what he gave up in a family to pursue his dreams of fame and glory.  If it weren't for the sex scene in the latrine I'd recommend it to most 18 year olds looking for their meaning in life.  This was definitely a much better movie (story, ploy, acting, etc.) than my wife and I ever imagined.  This is more &#34;real life&#34; than many Hollywood movies where you leave happy and giddy.  I recommend it for anyone looking for a serious drama-type movie.
1937053571|5.0|This was not only an epic series but a beautifully writes book. I was so scared waiting for the end of the book. After every page I turned I would look at the remaining pages left. I preordered this book but have been so busy I just read it yesterday (and finished it). I've recommended this book to everyone in my family. I love Jennifer Armentrout's work. This is my favorite book of all time. She has replaced my favorite author and is not my favorite! This book had me on edge, laughing, crying, angry and hurt. The ending was perfect and beautiful! I almost died thinking that she would be there forever .... Don't want to give too much away but this book was awesome! I will read again! The ending was just amazing. Thank you Jennifer for writing a beautiful book! I hope we can hear more about Alex and Aiden soon! Thank you so much for sharing your talents with us!
B00DWFQ2N4|3.0|not as good as his first album.  He had better songs in the first one and it is odd that so many songs are greater than 5min long and cannot really be played on the radio.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|I was very happy w/ this CD, but I usually only buy CD's I know I will enjoy anyway. A good selection of songs.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Great new album!  Much more mature but still has all of the flare that we have come to love from Katy Perry.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!!! I am addicted to it!!!! I run out of coins and turn it off to turn it on again 2 minutes later.
B004GJYRA0|5.0|We really like this movie -- enough to add it to our permanent library.<br />If you would enjoy a very artful soft-critique of old-time Americana, you'll really enjoy this movie.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|Monsters Ate My Condo is more fun than watching porn on your kindle, and people don't stare at you as much.
B00008G9JO|5.0|Well, you either like Jethro Tull or you don't.  I like their music and am glad to see most of their music is still available on disc. Some of their albums are no longer available, which is a real bummer.
B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|My son loves Chuggington and the new assignments for the chuggers in training.  He especially loves Chug Patrol Wilson.  Thanks for this free app!
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Funny!<br />Second movie we have seen with Jennifer Aniston lately. (&#34;Horrible Bosses&#34; was the other one. That movie is hysterical!) She is really good in these movies!
1250038820|4.0|I haven't actually taken the plastic off of the book (since it is a gift) and I'm sure it will be a great read.  What impressed me the most is the size of the book!  It's not one of those ginormous coffee-table books that you end up sending to Good Will.  It's about the size of a medium text book which means it will fit on our books shelves!  Yay and thanks.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The senseless,violent and boring film about zombies aestroying the earth. it was hard to believe that Brad Pitt, a good actor, would star in such a debacle. The best part of the film is when I gave up on it and turned it off about 30 minutes. If you enjoy watching zombies smash into car windows  for eternity, this movie is for you
B0055SWM08|5.0|I truly enjoy this game.  Not only is it fun to play but you have to use you brain and think ahead on moves you need to make.  Anyone who enjoys mind games or chess will like this game.  It is hard to stop once you start playing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this series... Especially on the third read... However, similarities with battle royale should be acknowledged and props given. Love katnisses character! And the vivid imagery of te arena!
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|This is the preachy story of a vice addicted pilot who saves nearly all on this plane from certain doom, but ultimately chooses to face incarceration rather than apply his usually deceitful ways to impugn a fellow crew member. Washington and Greenwood act well, but the story lacks depth.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Keeps you coming back.  I didn't think I would like it at first because I typically hate these kind of games but this one is fun and I love that it changes for the holidays.
B002XTBEDI|4.0|Not quite as good as the original &#34;Cranford&#34; but still if you liked &#34;Cranford&#34; you will like &#34;Return to Cranford&#34;. The characters you enjoyed are mostly there and it does tie up some loose strings. The whole series encouraged me to want to watch more Elizabeth Gaskell stories and I also recommend &#34;Wives and Daughters&#34;, loved it!!!!
0786955716|5.0|I gave this to my son. I guess he likes it. He plays this game all the time so I think it is functioning correctly. Don't know what else to say here.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|6 year old told to download it,  addictive but reminds me of the actual ticket game at Chukie Cheese's (Circus).
B00FI7XBIS|3.0|I really don't like this game very much.. no instructions were given and it is hard to play. waste of money
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|why does everything require internet connections... main reason why i didn;t give it 5 yet. not much else to say
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I recently updated the app and now it's not working correctly. When it DOES load, pictures won't. After a minute or two, it just stops. Please fix!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|A very fun game, with amazing graphics.  The skill shots and the available equipment help to make the game very enjoyable, especially for a free game.  A must for hunters and wanna be hunters.  For those who enjoy shooting games this is a must have app.
0811879542|5.0|Every kid and adult that reads this book has loved it. It is such a charming and funny book. The five year olds especially get a kick out of it but their younger siblings and parents do too. Even the older kids, sneak in a look. It is so funny to read in this digital age.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Gold game get it try it keep it play it it's fun share on Facebook fight get money listen to me
B00005N6KG|1.0|It seems to me for light use they would last about 10 months.  Not sure why the price hike.  I bought them back last Dec for $9 and there are $64.  Something is wrong for a product that would last no more than 10 months, then one side would not work.
0545615402|5.0|An absolute must have for any Harry Potter fan! No collection is complete without them. A little smaller then expected but top quality and gives a whole new insight into the world of Harry Potter.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved loved loved this story of ..words...and color....and love...told by the Soul Searcher. Well done Markus. I hope the movie does justice to all the characters.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The original Castleville was cumbersome, this version is faster... so far. I agree with a couple of the negatives, the crown to reward ratio is too high and you shouldn't be punished for not wanting to connect with facebook and spam your friends. But since Gnomeville was cancelled, this is the best choice for this type of game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple to setup and works flawlessly. I like it so much I am buying another one. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a cheap way to stream youtube and netflix to their TV.
0877180121|4.0|My daughter has no complaints with this nice easy to read. don't know much about lessons but I think this helps
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|This is THE best IP camera software I've found to date. Get it  !!! I've done alot of looking !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Realism without candy coated views of humanity. The author doesn't condescend or speak down to her young adult audience. This dystopian society could have been our future and hopefully teaches us how to not make those mistakes.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is challenging but not frustrating.  Can play a good amount of time without having to buy more power.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|This is the main browser for my tablet and is very clean and fast. There are some features I don't quite understand such as Dolphin Sonar--appears to be a voice control of some sort--and the gesture settings but the rest is pretty straight forward. Works in tandem with Google.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over without it needing to be a winter holiday season. Will Ferrell is a humorous actor, but let's face it, some of his films are just far fetched, over the top comedy that doesn't blend well as a story line. Elf on the other hand does a great job of capturing that holiday spirit and enough tasteful comedy to keep you laughing throughout! If you have never seen this movie, I would highly-recommend it for you and the family. I say family because it was well written for parents and kids in mind (like Shrek). You will replace all your traditional holiday movies with this one, guaranteed!
B0061S0A64|2.0|It was cool when working. I even made a little alarm tone sequence. Then I did not use it for a time and the next time I ran the app, it crashed. I am on wi-fi infrequently but when I am I make sure my apps are upgraded. I am reluctant to uninstall as I paid for this one.
B00CE03UOC|3.0|This is a fun game, but the constant harassment to share with friends and review is annoying. Additionally, I'm not a fan of in app purchases. If this game hadn't been free app of the day I would have passed.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I installed this app to get photo editing on the fly (like when I take my tablet on a trip). It has many features but some only work with a built-in camera which my tablet does not have. The features that I can use work well and the real-time filters are cool. I used it to turn one of my photos into custom wallpaper.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Love the new reboots of this sci fi series from the 70s  cast is great reminders of the original with out being silly copies
B004US4K2C|5.0|I have a rooted Nook Tablet 1st gen running Gingerbread. I have heard good things about this app and decided to try it. It works well and has a nice customizable layout.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's so convenient to get the books I want to read straight to my phone! Even though I would LOVE to have a Kindle, it's the next best thing!
B004YR8AJI|5.0|I bought this unit to utilize the unused slot in my Lenovo laptop. it is really made for the mac but it fits almost flush in my Expresscard slot. With its ability to read high capacity SDs and Micro SDs, it makes a handy removable ad hoc SSD. Works great with the Portable Apps Suite though I don't boot off it.
0393316041|5.0|This book is a lot of fun. For those of us who aren't math experts or physics geeks, this is a great way to see inside Feynman's head. Heard a lot about this author on &#34;The Big Bang Theory,&#34; and wanted to get an idea of what they're talking about. Definitely gives the feeling that Feynman may indeed be a serious physics geek and higher math whiz, but he is still also a regular human being, who does regular human stuff.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|good game needs more info on how to get the most out of your matches very much like phlinx in the pogo nonlinear games
B005LAII80|5.0|Amazing acting, cinematography and writing, this movie is not just a remake, it's a re-imagining and one that takes Dredd's cool factor to a whole new level. The use of slow motion and vibrant colors made for some excellent scenes while the set used caused for a suspensful action movie to rise from what many thought was simply a re-telling of Judge Dredd. This is a sci-fi that should not be missed.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|A movie that stars Jennifer Aniston that doesn't suck. What??? Yeah. That's right. Can you believe it. I'm pretty sure mike judge had something to do with it. Yay!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great one from Grisham!  This needs to be a movie!  Matthew mcconaughey should play Jake .  What do you think?
B000YMM3CC|3.0|Despite being kinda lame and sappy, this movie is watchable. I wouldn't say its good...lets just say it doesn't suck.
034580404X|2.0|Poorly written... I feel like this trilogy has gotten so much attention simply because of its content and not its quality.  This was actually a Twilight fan fiction.  A friend of mine who is an exec at a publishing company told me that his company rejected the 50 shades of grey trilogy.  But if you're just looking for some raunchy material to arouse you, who cares the quality of the writing, unless you're picky like me.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|One time a sequel equals the original story. The scenes with the lovesick Abe were the best part.  The Golden Army wasn't so bad either. Funny and sad by turns especially at the end.  Plenty of extras in the other two disks.  Want another Hellboy entry.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I cannot visit my neighbors farm and it is driving me nuts.  Please fix this ASAP.  I want to continue to play this game.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Disk plays well. No complaints. This was a good buy. I've watched this several times and it never seems to get boring. It's just as interesting and wild as it was the first time around back in the '80's.
082300659X|5.0|Juliette Aristides' books are all a &#34;must have&#34;, for artists as well as art lovers. The quality and appropriateness for the topic of each plate is top notch. She is part of a contemporary cadre of talented artists dedicated to the support of realism. A broad range of &#34;lessons&#34; - beyond the title range - can be had by thinking about the processes she introduces.
B009F7ORQW|5.0|i had to open the package to see what i ordered and my girls are at the age where they are trying to find out whats in the box.  i recieved it quickly and no worries...thank you so much!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is exciting, nerve wracking, and very adventurous. I wish that Suzanne Collins would make another sequel. I love that in the epilogue, is tells you about Peeta and Katniss' baby and that there are no more Hunger Games. I also love that in the epilogue, it has the song that Katniss sung to Rue before she died in the first book. If you want to see the movie and you like to know what's coming, then read the book first. (I love the elevator scene with Johanna Mason)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|KNOW WHAT U R GETTING FIRST!!!<br />So, if you are planning on getting one of these things just know: you cannot stream ur own media...at least not right now. This perfect for &#34;dumb&#34; TVs or for bypassing most &#34;smart&#34; TV interfaces that aren't good anyway. At the moment of this write up it works with: Google media (YouTube and Play apps), Netflix, HBO Go, Pandora and Google recently created a SDK so more apps should be on the way to allow you to use this device the way you want. Set up is a breeze, i used the IOS app to do it and it took like three minutes and the only problem I have had is that once it would lose the stream, it would just throw up an error message, in order to rectify this all I had to do was detach it from the television and its power source and re-plug it in a &#34;reboot&#34; if you will. All in all its a good device and does what it's asked to 99% of the time.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I am very pleased that it cleared up so much space on my Kindle Fire and is easy to use. This is a very useful app.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|Great case! I like the two background that came along with it. Protects my phone and also looks very stylish
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This is the best series i ever read. I wade to hate to read now i love it!! This deserves two thumbs up!
B00004SVIK|5.0|Pink Floyd is the best, and this collection is terrific.  This collection is one of my very favorites, and will continue to be so for some time to come.
141659521X|5.0|Most likely one of Vince Flynn's best novels, although I find them all really great, so that's saying a lot.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|Soooooo entertaining and so much fun it will really have you on the edge of your seat.  Absolutely one of the most exciting and fun games to play out of the Amazon market :)
0399160450|5.0|This is a great Jack Ryan novel. Sure would like to have him around for real sometimes. Headline making book in today's world.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great series! This book has a surprise ending. The middle of the book drags a bit but the end makes it worth it.
0399160477|5.0|It stands up well against all Tom Clancy novels. It almost feels like his headlines are coming across our news networks on a daily basis. Might want to alert our security team to give them pointers from Jack Ryan. Couldn't hurt.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I enjoy reading books and I like to purchase ebooks that won't take up space in my library.  My IPAD is great for reading kindle, but when I don't have Wi-Fi, it is nice to be able to use my phone with the kindle as well.  A great reading app.
B0073COMUW|5.0|Perfect for my grandmother's laundry room.I understand why I have to type way more than my main thought. _ _
B00571F26Y|5.0|I read this and it helped me to lose weight which was not my intention.  I wanted my blood work to come back ok.  It is hard to follow but it works.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Motivated, non-stop action.  The story draws you in early and keeps you, the romantic drama is kept to a minimum.  Gets to the point quickly, makes the point as promised, leaves you wanting more.... good thing there's a sequel.  Hope it's good too!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is an awesome game for big kids and adults too. I really enjoyed it and I'm in my 30s.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|If you want a realistic hunting game this is it. it is like your actually hunting and the guns are great!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun, and addicting, but really frustrating. all the puzzles are chalenging, but do able, &amp; there are enough puzzles to keep you busy. I really like that it saves your progress on individial levels.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|It's too dramatic. It is more focused on sex than history. I gave it three stars because the costumes are fantastic.
B00E9A656K|5.0|its cool just need more money n gold too start off thoe.,<br />oright game overall juss hard to get better car's
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I do love this album. Since \\"I like it\\" would only be 4 stars, I must give 5 to express that \\"I love it\\". People are critical of Kanye West because he interrupted Taylor Swift, people are critical of Kanye West because of out of context snippets of interviews and tabloid headlines, people are critical of Kanye West because people like to sit around and do nothing, yet criticize other people for having money and success. If you approach this album with the mindset that it couldn't possibly be good because you've already come to bold and unflattering conclusions about Kanye West because of tabloid headlines, then you may very well dislike this album. If you approach this album with strict expectations of a rap album with soul sample based beats and a spirit reminiscent of old school hip hop such as was felt on College Dropout, then you will be disappointed with this album. If you're prepared to embrace raunchy lyricism with abrasive experimental raw instrumentals that push the boundaries of hip hop and music in general, then this is worth listening to.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan Boyle is the very best ever. She has a very refreshing voice with a quality seldom repeated. She truly surprised<br />everyone in her first audition a few years back.
B008JFURII|5.0|I am not an action movie, however , RED 2 is funny, really enjoyed it! I will watch it again.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|These are my favorite singers and they seem to always do their best, so they deserve the best rating. Susan Boyle is my very favorite singer ever, Jackie Evancho is the most wonderful child singer I have ever heard with an amazing voice. Josh Groban is the best male singer I know. I am a musician and piano teacher.
0307719774|5.0|I love this little Diary.  The size is small, but I was expecting it to be on the small side.  I can't wait to go back and see what I wrote.
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan & Charlotte are a wonderful team and their voices can hold my attention.They compliment one another as they sing and I would suggest their album to anyone that loves the best in music.
1439130833|5.0|Excellent book. I really like it. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Made me want to go to Australia. I read a couple of the author's other books afterward, a bit of a binge, and this was the best of them.<br /><br />It's a good escape, no one I wanted to keep in my head but enjoyed reading their stories.
0061438294|4.0|This is a very interesting book and is very informational. It explains things in a simple straightforward manner. I would recommend.
0321544080|5.0|I love this book. I am now reading it for the third time in two years. I find this book inspirational and enlightening and interesting. I don't consider it a tutorial, but plenty of tips on good practice are given. As someone else indicated, this book is like sitting in a bar with an old friend and having him tell you about the subject and the circumstances of some great photography. You won't be disappointed in this book.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|This has a great cast.  It's basically about navigating through relationships.  I got a kick out of it.  Watched it twice.  I heart Bradley Cooper. :)
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Universal City, CA, December 3, 2013--Universal Pictures today announced that a percentage of proceeds from the upcoming home entertainment release of Fast & Furious 6 will be donated to Paul Walker's non-profit Reach Out WorldWide this Includes Blu-ray, DVD, Digital and On Demand<br /><br />**Added 12/8/2013**<br />I Finally got to watch this Amazon Digital.

And remember it is entertainment.<br /><br />Proud to Be one of The Millions of members of the Fast Family.<br /><br />R.I.P. Paul Walker and Roger Rodas
B003TSDI0E|4.0|it's a very good way to learn how to think philosophically. It gives you even the history of philosophy, and all the greats of philosophy, it's just a shame it's not more complicated.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Daryl Dixon begins to come to the forefront of the storyline! Favorite season yet! All primary character relationships begin to unfold.
B00288KNL8|5.0|EXCELLENT condition! The dual-sided dvd played great , my daughter loved putting the 3D glasses on and having movie night together PLUS she could easily flip it to the 2D side and watch it in the daytime without the glasses while she plays .BOTH versions are vivid , beautiful / unique and full of laughs-great buy!!!
B009NH6AOQ|4.0|The second season had a lot of whining, so it was weak in that regard. The third season whines less, methinks, but it might just overdo the gore and darkness. More than anything though, a certain character continues to damage the show. Fortunately, they don't stick around forever.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars for the simple fact that it was very much on point and the suggestions were easy to follow. I am interested in publishing some books for Kindle and reading this showed me easy to understand steps in order to make that happen. This is definitely a must read for the ones who are unsure of how to get their books published and the proper formatting to use.
B003G4W49C|5.0|An incredible read that commands you to keep reading to get to the end! I breezed through this book in just 2 days.
0385537131|5.0|I've always been a Grisham fan but his latest showed his talents in the best way.  Another one of those nights where I gave up sleeping for a very good read.  I admit to a love of legal thrillers but Grisham is back on top of his game.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This was an awesome puzzle game. The music is pleasant and the game makes you think. Good for an hour or two.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Such an improvement on the original! A lot of little scenes added, which are fun, but so much more depth to the relationship with his father.  And a much more satisfying - and logical - ending (to the extent that a story like this can be logical).  I am among the millions who were incredibly dissatisfied with the original ending, and this is such an improvement.  Unfortunately, Margot Kidder is still miscast as Lois, and there is little real chemistry between her and Chris Reeve, the best Superman, in IMHO.
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|Most of you say that this is the last Tom Clancy novel there will be. What you all fail to realize is that he wrote a sequel to Against All Enemies called Search and Destroy that was never released because of the terrible rating Against All Enemies got.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is really a great game. Fun for all ages. Hard to crowns without buying them. Wish you could earn or find more.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book. It was as good as the movie if not better. It was hard to put down.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Funny, funny, funny....... Had to watch it again weeks later. I promise you, if you have a sense of humor you will like this movie!
B009XI7RF6|2.0|Pretty boring, nothing all that original. Artwork is good, as is programming, but the concept gets a pass. Keep looking.
B008D28HYS|4.0|The puzzles were challenging; but I thought that after doing &#34;x&#34; amount of puzzles, it would update and perhaps add more puzzles.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|This show is so incredible. The characters (even Barney!) are impossible to not fall in love with. While I think the show was best at the beginning, they have worked hard to make the later seasons just as good and they are succeeding! I can watch this show over and over and never get bored.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it. No longer need to log on to XBOX Live to watch Netflix. Cheap. Easy to install. You can't beat the price for what it does.
B00GINENG0|5.0|It's so fun an exciting that you can take car of Tom and when he's a baby he looks so cute and sounds so funny when yo touch his tail
B00EEPFRGE|3.0|I like it, but..... Am I the only one who doesn't like the production?? I love the songs etc, and I think it is a great album, however the sound is very compressed, and worse of all the sounds of the drums especially the cymbals is mushy and annoying. I noticed this also on 'the second coming' album. Unfortunately this spoils the listening pleasure. If you listen back to the production of for example'Against the Law' you might see what I mean. Don't get me wrong people, I like the record, but not the sound production, sorry therefore it deserves 3 stars.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Heavily promoted movie and was looking forward to watching it...until some of the negative reviews. So instead of watching it in the theater I watched it at home with lesser expectations.<br />Pleasantly surprised that the film did a nice job of combining action with the zombie horror element. The pace of the film was good with a minimum of &#34;talking heads&#34; to slow it down. The downside is that there was little character development and a great actress like Mireille Enos (who I loved in The Killing) was almost invisible in her role. Obviously this was a Brad Pitt movie and that is not bad even if his character was underdeveloped too.<br />I am a huge Walking Dead fan and it was interesting to see how the 'rules' were similar or different than the film version of zombies. The WW Z zombies were lightning fast unlike the Walking Dead version. Otherwise most of the 'rules' were similar.<br />The biggest difference between The Walking Dead and WW Z was character development. Loads in The Walking Dead and almost none in WW Z. BUT this is an action movie, not a season long TV series, so it works just fine.<br />Definitely recommend if you want a good action movie and don't mind a little gore.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Do not buy this app. There is a 50% chance it will not credit you your due tokens/coins when you purchase them.  Had to call Amazon customer service several times.  They helped me once and refunded my purchase.  The 1st time I had a problem they told me I had to contact Gameloft.  Gameloft sent an automated e-mail that said they would contact me in 3 business days. It was then followed by another auto e-mail.<br /><br />This game loads very slowly. It freezes up and I have to do a manual reset on my device.  I cannot check my &quot;mail&quot; through the game. I will be removing this app immediately.<br /><br />Do not get suckered into this one like I did.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|plays well, good graphics, music isn't too annoying.  The classic game on your kindle.  Was a good FAOTD download.  thanks
0316201545|5.0|Grand daughters favorite!  We had to replace it because someone in her fourth grade class stole her first one I bought her
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. A young woman is diagnosed with cancer. Sounds like a bummer. But it was handled beautifully  I highly recommend it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Superior to a regular Kindle charger for my Kindle FIre.  Charges faster and holds the charge much longer for my Kindle FIre which is used several hours daily.  The longer cord allows charging in different locations while still in use.  IRREPLACEABLE (as is me Kindle FIre!!).
1451666179|5.0|I have been following Allie's blog every since the Alot posting, her work is amazing, and I went to a book signing that she spent at least 7 hours signing so that everyone that showed up could have a signed copy. On top of everything else she made a custom drawing for everyone that requested one.  Not only is the book hilarious, but the author seems genuinely nice.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Breaking Bad was a show that just kept getting better and better as each season went on and the second season is no exception.  If you're a fan of the show, you'll agree with me.  If you're not, hop on board the bandwagon and watch season after season and marvel at the excellence of the show and grieve with its demise.  It went out on top, though, which can't be said for a most of the shows on television.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little guy started out with its fair share of problems (it kept on kicking out of the program being watched) however it seems there has been an update that has fixed this and I LOVE it now.
0767817729|5.0|Excellent movie headed by Kevin Costner, who makes the mistake of falling in love with the wife of a powerful man who seeks revenge on them both.  The husband, played by Anthony Quinn, is as evil as they get, and his unhappy wife is played by Madeleine Stowe.  I don't want to give anything away, but trust that it is a great movie that will keep you in suspense throughout.
1250012570|5.0|Park is the only Asian kid at school and, even though he has a solid group of friends and a healthy family life, he feels like he doesn't fit in anywhere -- like something is missing from his relationships. Eleanor is the quirky, chubby, wild-haired, eccentric new girl from a poor and dysfunctional family. When they meet on the bus, it's far from first love at first sight. But love is exactly what it becomes.<br /><br />Usually, even if I loved a book, there are one or two little things I didn't love about it -- small details that just didn't sit quite right with me. Such is not the case with [[ASIN:1250012570 Eleanor & Park]]. I couldn't find a single fault with this novel -- not one. Rainbow Rowell just NAILED IT. She nailed it with her characters, who are relatable and authentic. She nailed it with her portrayal of first love, which feels sweet and innocent but never sentimental or corny. She even nailed it with her 80s references, from the clothing to the music to the slang.<br /><br />I read recently that some groups have tried to ban this book from schools, which I find utterly ridiculous. Yes, there is profanity in this book, but it feels organic to the story and never excessive. And it's insulting, too, because [[ASIN:1250012570 Eleanor & Park]] is so much more than just the profanity. It's a thoughtful novel about family, poverty, abuse, bullying, and love, and it explores all of these themes with sensitivity and deft humor.<br /><br />I found myself smiling through so much of [[ASIN:1250012570 Eleanor & Park]]. I was completely charmed by both of the title characters; they, and their responses to the events that happened to them, felt so real. The progression of their relationship felt natural, and I was in awe of how accurately Rowell was able to capture that feeling of being in love for the first time. I loved the dual perspectives, which I thought was the perfect method of telling this story. Ultimately, this book just made me feel so much: from euphoria to heartbreak and nearly every emotion in between. Rowell nailed it, and I loved every word.
B00006JSS8|5.0|All of Stevie's hits are on this CD and it doesn't get any better than that!  I recommend it for any Stevie Wonder or Motown fan.  Absolutely great!
B00000GAIW|3.0|Doesn't have the great sound the original Agualung Vinyl had but well worth the price. I downloaded the DVD for my IPOD on my motorcycle and it sounds just fine with the wind blowing through your hair and the roar of the V-Twin exhaust.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|TOTALLY worth every penny!<br /><br />This app is incredible and I use it nightly to go to sleep to.<br />I love the ability to combine different sounds such as whale songs, waves crashing against the shore, ocean noise, nighttime beach sounds, etc and save the combination to use later also!<br /><br />I love this app but just wish I could use it on all my devices but Amazon's Appstore isn't compatable with one of my Android phones so no I have to use either my tablet or my personal cell to use this app, can't use on my work cell.
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|I loved this show and I wanted to order this when I first heard about it months ago but wasn't able to at the time, now I am reading reviews from people complaining about the $200 price for the set and having content missing. So how is it the price is now $500? There is no way I am paying this much for 5 seasons of twelve 45 minute episodes AMC
B0058VW36U|5.0|REALLY great game with engaging gameplay, plenty of levels, varying degrees of difficulty and superb graphics!<br /><br />I bought the pro version for each new &#34;Cut the Rope&#34; game because I love them so much!<br /><br />Would reccomend to anyone with time to kill and who loves addictive physics-based games to play on their Android device!
6305388458|5.0|It's not blasphemous--heretical, maybe--but definitely the highest form of low brow humor next to the Holy Grail. I am a man of strong faith and find this movie not the least bit offensive. It's a satirical view of Biblical times and some of the preposterous thinking wrought forth from religious &#34;authorities&#34; that even Jesus made fun of. Read the New Testament closely, and you'll find Jesus could sometimes be sarcastic, facetious, and even down right angry at those who professed to know God better than everyone else. The Monty Python group are in the best form with their dry humor and plain silliness.
B008K8U13K|5.0|Great game, exactly like the old Sega Genesis versions.<br />Easy to play with numerous levels and secrets to gain additional points and levels!
B00GK5X2HC|1.0|Look, all these movies like this that discredit the one true God are stupid. I'm sure there are Christians out there who are reading this and nodding there heads. If you want to be a Christian just tell God your story for all the bad stuff you ever did and then tell him you believe he's real and that you want him to come into your heart. It's as simple as that God bless you!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I'm kind of stupid, I didn't realize that this is the precursor to the Alien movies. Once I started getting into it, I saw it at the theater, I think it's right up there with the rest of the Alien series. I know many other people won't agree w/ me,  but I really enjoyed this movie, a lot !
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable spy flick. I gave it 4 out of 5, because it didn't have the dazzling gadgetry that I'm used to seeing.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is a must have if I didn't have Google I don't know where I would be its my best friend
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I'm only a few levels in but I'm using this to brush up on some languages I previously knew and learning some basics in new ones! If you're a language lover this is for you
B004UID2LC|5.0|YouTube is very helpful and I'm glad that I have this app. I always come back and use this tool
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I don't think I've ever given something 5 stars but I did for this.  It deserves 5 stars not because it is a perfect experience but because of what it has accomplished.<br /><br />With a small budget, 343i was able to pull off a well told and exciting live action movie in the Halo universe.  This is not some fan service that only the Halo devotees can enjoy, this a great movie with great acting, a compelling narrative and solid action.<br /><br />Forward Unto Dawn follows a group of cadets in a top tier military academy, particularly Private Lasky (who we see in Halo 4).  Lasky  brings to the forefront some major themes of the Halo-verse that have only seen much consideration in some of the books.  The uncertainty of war, the complication of the civil war preceding the Covenant-Human war and the fear and bravery that accompany any conflict.<br /><br />It's very exciting to see the Covenant War begin and get to see how frightening it was to all of the personnel and troops who weren't Spartans.  The Covenant are mysterious, scary and portrayed in a visceral way.<br /><br />And of course, we get the larger-than-life awesomeness of seeing a real life master chief in action.<br /><br />Don't write this off as something only for the hardcore Halo fans, this is a film that a casual fan, or even just a movie fan, can enjoy.<br /><br />Great action, great characters and great story, all done with a tiny budget that never feels tiny.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun to be had by everyone we keep looking for different games all the time. We keep looking and trying all the time for different games.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It I highly addictive. My kids even enjoyed it. It really makes you think.<br />I couldn't put it down.
B00EV1KT4Q|5.0|If I could say I loved the movies. Good thing I watched before ordering. I was suppose to get it today, Dec 3, 2013. But nothing .. Come on Amazon if you say you will deliver on the day it was going to be release then deliver. Still sitting in Laurel Md since 2am. I live maybe 3 hours away in Virginia.<br /><br />I got the movies a five star due the movies not to Amazon
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is so awesome!!! It can turn your tv on too. There aren't a ton of apps that support this yet, but we are getting more and more. Once google opens it up there will be so much support for it and so many apps that use it. Using your phone as the remote is so convenient. never have to worry about finding a remote or dead batteries...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this because I'm lazy.<br /><br />Easy to set up and use. Works with mobile devices. Works with pc and mac. Can even finagle it to work with Amazon Prime -- although it's not yet supported and timing kinks need to work out.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied.
0316322407|5.0|Malala is beyond remarkable.  God had a special plan for her life.  Please read this book and see how the whole world is connected and how a young teenager is changing her world and the whole world.  Just a stunning life she has already lived and how the love and respect of her father, has made her a confident strong young women.
B003G4W49C|5.0|First book I've read in a while that prevented me from putting it down. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an adventurous book.
B00GQ7PILC|1.0|What a crap ending to a series! And unless they plan on making a sequel of some sort...why would they end a show that's so popular?
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|Would not purchase, it was okay but only a few levels are free then you have to purchase this app
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|Delivered on Dec 3. Amazing. Album is great.. great vocals and beats. Futuristic sound and beats. Electro, pop, acoustic, ballad. Its Britney Bitch. My Queen.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Really great game good graphics but it gets a little slow at times if you're not willing to spend some cash.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|It's a fun game to play.  The only thing bad about it is that if you don't play it regularly the money you earn will go down.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was truly awesome. If you are looking for an unpredictable book, well this is it! I could not  believe the ending! AHHHHHH!
B006O6F932|5.0|The attention to detail is fantastic and the playset is larger than it appeared online.  It is quite sturdy, but a few of the smaller details are a bit less sturdy than one would like, so be sure to watch when the really little kiddies are around.  Also, this is DEFINITELY not for children under 3 - there are some smaller bits, so there's a potential choke hazard!<br /><br />This set is sure to please all those Monster High fans!<br /><br />ALSO PLEASE NOTE:  There have been a lot of comments about this playset (and other toys) being shipped in only their own packaging.  That would totally ruin anyone's surprise!  There's a quick fix for that though: at checkout, mark that the item is a GIFT and it will be shipped nice and snug inside an unmarked package!  Surprise maintained.....
B005H9B44A|5.0|Extremely Well Done Movie. Not a bad thing to look at in the whole movie. Well-cast, great effex, plot - believable. Can watch over & over.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Edit: The product I bought was version OS PRO 7 and it was very user friendly, A FEW UPDATES, MORE SO BUT THEN... nowdays it is less so. I did not buy and do not endorse version 8<br />I bought this app, version OS PRO 7, at the previous discount of $ 4.99 and I am glad I did. It works as advertised.<br />I've sent, downloaded and opened Word docs, pdfs; I even did transfer customized Word docx and then created two new templates from those docs. I work with my favorite format, fonts and settings.<br />Working offline, it is very easy, just save your docs in the Internal Storage / Documents folder and open and work with them anywhere, anytime, no WiFi connection required.<br />It includes the regular fonts we use and need. Buying the additional Font pack is not necessary unless you need the other fonts included. Do you have a lot of documents coming in from many sources? Then you may need it.<br />I recommend you to buy it at its new sale price before it goes up again. A bargain at any price.<br />Why do I insist it works as advertised? Because it was very easy to use, intuitive even before I read the user guide. It includes both an online help guide and a pdf user guide file so you do not have to go online to read it. I just opened OfficeSuite Pro and started working.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that you can choose the version you wish to read. The Free app even has audio files that read the chapters for several versions of the bible. Whether you like NIV or KJV or NKJV you've got a choice on what to read and who doesn't like free?
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This arrived quickly and is what my daughter requested.  She enjoys watching movies she is learning about in her film class
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was outstanding! The descriptive writing brings The characters to life an you can feel, smell and taste the story. A beautiful read and being a lover of fruit and flowers this book spoke to me in technicolor and emotion.
B00E5INZ82|2.0|That's all you do in this game is shift! No steering or anything! Sux! Then of course they want you to spend more money! Purchasing the app isn't enough! Greedy! That's pretty much the only way too win races is by spending more money after already giving them money to purchase the app! The car they &quot;give&quot; you is too chitty to win races! Upgrade your car, hire a mechanic, buy new tires, or you don't win a race! Kiss my hoo ha! I want my money back!
B007SGM084|5.0|One of those books you can not put down. It is fast paced. The relationship between these two dysfunctional people grew rather quickly. There is enough mystery here to keep you interested and wondering how things will turn out. Not for everyone perhaps as it is heavy on the sexual content, but I found a story there.
0545586178|5.0|Got this along with the 1st book for a Christmas gift. Perfect condition, great for the price. She's going to love it!
B0041OT9W6|4.0|Great book, older story that I enjoyed reading again.  My last book got lost in the move.  Enjoyed reading.  Easy read.
0439023521|5.0|Got this for a gift, along with with the second book. Came quiet, and in great condition. Great for the price!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush saga!!! I play it when I'm on my laptop or kindle fire..I will be the first to tell everyone how addicted I am to the game..I have no troubles with the game on either of my devices...
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have read hundreds of books from the Hunger Games to Harry Potter to Bridge to Tarabithia and I love this series but that ending without her... I'm sorry but Insurgent to me is the last book in the series. This book was too dull for 70% of it and that ending almost had me in tears. NO. Insurgent was the last book end of Story. Either that or write a better ending. I have a reading level above a collage master degree level almost collage professor. I retain most of what I read for over 4 years but I wish I could forget that ending.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Quite roomy, can hold a number of lenses. Just unzip it, and everything is reachable. Overall, a very good product for the price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think Subway Surfer is a real challenging game. I think that it will really make yourself feel like you need to play longer or to try to beat your friends that you have on Facebook.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I was really gripped by this book. A thoroughly enjoyable read. Moves along at good clip. Engrossing characters. Would like to see more of this author.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It told of a story in a devastating war.  I never in my life have seen such destruction. But one girl had a lot of heart. She was a hero in my eyes.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I was filled with a sense of wonder  while viewing the world through the eyes of the characters.  Crichton and  Preston did a phenomenal job of making so many science concepts digestible for the layman.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|Loved every page and couldn't put it down! Another Cassandra Clare fantasy come to life in the palm of my hands and my minds eye!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I truly loved this book for the first<br />50 pages.  It  became a bit morbid and gruesome after that for my taste.  However it is definitely spellbinding.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|this is a really good game it is like clash of clans but it's not so don't think it is
B0055SWM08|3.0|While this is a fun and challenging game, the biggest problem I have is I work hard to get perfect score on every level and when I close the game and open it to play again all of my perfect level achievements are gone.  Fix that and I will consider giving it five stars.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I thought this game  was dope and I would really like to see some !!more of these games with some marvel characters
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a great app. I use it all the time and it is very accurate, even for my little out of the way place. I like their android version even better as it gives an extended forecast even longer (30days) which helps me plan trips, being more informed weather wise. It also helps me plan for allergies days, frost and garden days, etc. I find what the weather is along trip routes and destinations. Great app. Thanks
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Lots of fun, IF you like Bryson. Wry tone throughout. The info in the book is all over the map. God fun. It was a big year.
B008EEZ64Y|3.0|My favorite part of this book was Lowry's Newberry Acceptance Speech. I'm just not a fan of sci-fi / fantasy books. I didn't like anything about the world the people lived in, not even the constant acts of being polite. The ending was abrupt and left me hanging. I do appreciate the emphasis on accepting the past as part of who you are innately, and the importance of being grateful for the little things. Glad I read the book.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|There was a little too much personal indulgence and bragging, but other than that it was a good read.  Okay.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very challenging mind game, but addicting. I have to limit how often I will play it, or I'll never get my Christmas shopping done.
B00FQ53NIA|3.0|its another in a long line of hit and miss from Britney Spears who a decade ago was running things. now  she still has a pressence its just that the music isn't challenging her and it feels phoned in.  she was never  a diamond of a voice, however nowadays its even more of a step off.  however that can be overlooked because as a stylist she carved her lane and kept her thing going, the biggest knock here is that there is no real stand out songs on this set, though some cool moments in places that have more to do with the Production than the actual songs themselves.  she still keeps a interest, she just needs the right songs to match where she is as to trying to stay in a lane which is one long remix and no swing and it can't hit you one more time.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|My husband is retired military and I ordered this book for him. He had a hard time reading the whole book and said that it was lacking in detail. May be of more interest to someone that doesn't have a military background.
B00881VLCE|2.0|This is a great puzzle app; when it works.  I was able to download one puzzle package.  When I finished that and wanted to download more it doesn't work.  I removed the app from my device and then downloaded it again and it didn't work.  I removed it from my cloud and downloaded it again.  This time it allowed me to view puzzles to download, but the minute I tried to download them, it wouldn't do it.  Messages are web page not found and server down.  I love this app and would love to do more puzzles, but it won't let me.  Wish they would fix it.
