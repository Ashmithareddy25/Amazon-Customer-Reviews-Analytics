B007ZXK08C|5.0|I loved this book, it kept me intrigued the whole way through, couldn't put it down, thoroughly recommend it and have to all
B0063M22QO|5.0|Have always liked playing Mahjong games and this and this one is really good.  Like it because you're not timed. Would definately recommend it!!!
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I love Kate Morton, I wish she could write more, I think she is my favourite author, her books are so different, always interesting, well researched and thoroughly enjoyable, I couldn't put it down
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Avengers is an awesome movie!  The story line flowed smoothy and you could see connections to the previous superheros' movies.  The actors are believable, the flying ship is so REAL, and the fighting is exciting and continues at different angles around the city and other places in the movie without getting belabored.  It is a great movie of learning to appreciate everyone's talents and accidental gamma infusions!  It really shows what can happen when good teams up together to defeat the bad.  I would recommend this a a family movie with kids of about 10 years age or older.  We will definitly watch it again!
B003THJA1G|5.0|Fantastic series.  good character development.  I don't always figure it out ahead of the story.  Fun and yet frustrating interaction between Beckett and Castle
B00285K1KE|2.0|This movie was disturbing, disjointed, disconnected, and discouraging to know I wasted a couple hours watching this movie.  The split screens first of all were distracting and drove us nuts.  Some scenes were unnesessary, while other scenes needed more support.  The wild dreams and the thinking back in time was, to say the least, very confusing and bizare.  I definitly would NOT recommend wasting your time watching this awfully produced movie unless you are using it to write a research paper on the psychotic nature of the writer and producer of this movie.  UUUGGGGHHHH!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I like Matt Smith as the Dr. but I wasn't attached to him as much as I was to David Tennant. With that being said, this season's writing (and the lasts) was so new and intriguing that I now have a great fondness for this Dr. I think this show is so fun, the cast is fantastic(love the Pond's and River Song!), and the younger Dr. adds to this new season. LOVE IT, keep em coming. Now because of this show, I have started Torchwood. Oh boy, there goes my plans for awhile.
B003XQPYR2|5.0|Some of my favorite movies for repeat viewings are those with Russell Crowe in them. Gladiator and Master and Commander are two others I can't get enough of. Crowe has teamed up with Ridley Scott more than once and with outstanding results. Crowe and Scott-Free Productions work seamlessly to bring epic immersions into the world of the Middle Ages, ancient Rome, 19th Century South Seas...each taking us with them for 2 hours of the best kind of escape.<br />I'm viewing Robin Hood again and loving it just as much on the 5th showing as I did the first.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The stories are original and just down right enjoyable to watch. The idea of an alternative universe is not new but Fringe does give the concept a genuine twist.
B007REV4T8|3.0|I have owned every Bond movie over the past thirty-plus years and have looked forward with so much anticipation that it becomes a set-up for disappointment when one of the series is...well....eh.  This movie was okay but my friend and I looked at each other as the credits were rolling and shared a look of (shrugging): &#34;Eh.&#34;<br /><br />It was OKAY...but the Bond movies are supposed to be &#34;BOOM!&#34;...NUCLEAR!!  NOT...firecracker-so-so.<br /><br />I own it but only because I want them all. Until Barbara Broccoli gives up and closes the door on 007.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was locked in reading this book. I hope the movie doesn't ruin this book.<br /><br />Anyone who likes the Zombie genre will love this.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|People have been mean to me on this game and cussing to me. DO NOT BUY. BE CAREFUL IF U BUY
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book i have catching firs and i cant wait to see it in theaters yahoo yeah !!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Note: I'm going to write this as if people have seen Season 2. I recommend not reading this review if you haven't seen Season 2.<br /><br />Season 3 continues in the same vein as Season 2, and while the season is plot-arc driven, there are still some essentially stand-alone episodes. The Season 3 episodes take place in both worlds; the alternate versions of the main characters are irritatingly smug a-holes, and the dichotomy really kept me glued to my seat and rooting for the home team. Season 3 is slow in places, but just as good as Season 2.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|The video played well from Amazon Prime. That's where the good news stopped. I thought the film was just another dreary Russian tale of woe that was painful to watch. But, if you like that kind of story or are fascinated with period costumes or just like to watch Kiera, it's the movie for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is amazing!!!!!!! love it!!! i hope you like it to!!! there is a lot of games in it
B007VYAJAE|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing this film. I knew a good deal about Bob before, but the rare footage and interviews alone made this worth watching.
B00B2TUKI0|1.0|I was so disappointed with this release, that I'll put it in my sell pile as soon as I give it a second spin. I might take one song from it, but the rest is as bad or worse than \\"Snorah Jones\\". She has such great potential, but 1 cd does not mean everything you do will be as, or near as good everytime :>(
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Probably the best drama on television right now. Period (no pun intended) I can't wait for season 4. The acting is fantastic.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When the Hunger Games hype began, I stayed far away, just like I did with the Twilight hype. Finally, after hearing from multiple people how great they were, I hopped on the band wagon. I saw the movie first (which I don't recommend if you're in the position to chose at this point), and immediately loved the series. The movie (only the first one at this point) is great, but the books are phenomenal. The books offer so much more insight to the characters, that actually help bring the movie to life more when you see it. I have now read all 3 books and enjoyed each equally. Highly recommend!
B003S2LVPK|5.0|kind of corny but loved it.  great movie.  queen music is awesome.  would definitely watch it again and again. got hooked on it when it came out.
B0094KORXI|5.0|My grandson loves this movie.  He watches it over and over.  Great moral values presented in this movie. I love it too
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All the books were great! It's always nice for a series to end just a  good, if not better, than it started.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like these &#34;how do we survive &#34;TEOTWAWKI&#34; type shows. Interesting characters so far. I usually give up on most of them when they fall into the old soap opera formula of &#34;I failed to tell the truth because of my fear so someone else behaves without knowledge so bad things happen-oh yeah, now I will tell the whole truth and we can spend an entire show fixing the error that would have been prevented by my telling the whole truth in the first place&#34; blah, blah, Harlequin Romance immature characters abound plot line.<br />  Since I have only seen the 1st episode I have very little to say except &#34;Here's hoping for some inventive writing!&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game, I play it all the time.  When I baby sit I give the kid a kindle, and we play together on a lan world while I use my phone.  Also I read &quot;there is no lava&quot;, there actually is.  If you search lava seeds, you can find worlds with lava.  One seed that has lava is &quot;the S word&quot;.  Just over tge hill from the spawn is a lava spawn.  Anyone who likes minecraft should definetly give this game a try.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|An I'm glad i did. Would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who fancies themselves a celebrated vain egotist, with a hint of psycho.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Love this book and James Dashner! No complaints on this one...fyi don't read the prologue the kill order until after you've read the whole series.
B000JQUHLM|3.0|Can see how a sequel can happen. But the original is best. Still it was a childhood favourite and loved the film too. She still is the most naively annoying individual one could read about. So it was ok.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|well I thin it is a really good game if I told people. about it I would say its greasy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|When I need the forecast quick, this takes no time at all on my Fire. turn it on, there it is.
0345803485|5.0|So, this is the book everyone has been talking about!! Got it in the mail yesterday and started reading it last night and had a hard time putting it down!!  Thanks again and have a good day!!!
B007N8RULO|3.0|Interface auto-hides and can be buried under cards when the stacks get long enough. It works, and it is acceptable for a free game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So far best d/load calculator. Really great for. Kids. I saw this and said, self. Why didnt they. This when<br />I was growing up!
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|I can't believe it has been 40 years since the original came out.  We loved the original movie and have also enjoyed Caberet presented with Joel Gray on the stage.  This DVD just brings back all the wonderful memories and music.  Although the story goes from joyful to sad, that was what happened in real life in Germany during Hitler's rise to power.  If some of you were too young to enjoy the original movie, now is your chance to see a really excellent movie with the very best in acting and great music.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Love it!! Awsome when your. On the go and just can't. Get to laptop or computer.have not<br />tried it to fullest yet but I like it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!  Can't wait for the movie!  &#34;Catniss Everdeen The Girl on Fire!&#34;<br />On to book 3.  Suzanne Collins is AMAZING!
B003XYERRM|5.0|With all the news concerning the recent discovery of Richard III's remains, you may be curious to know more about his life.  Don't settle for Shakespeare's skewed account of this King, which some say was prompted by payments from his rivals to sully his character.  This book gives a much more accurate portrait of this controversial character.  Ms. Pennman has the ability to draw you into a story like no other author I know.  You'll want to read al, of her excellent novels.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show set the standard for other great shows that followed... Justified, SOA, etc.  Even though it was done 12 yrs ago, very enjoyable.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Good storyline,but not believable near the end.  Connelly is usually grounded.  This ending is to farfetched.  Harry crosses the line as a police officer.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors because he always &#34;out foxes&#34; me!  I think I have the mystery all figured out, and he hits me broadside with the unexpected!  That's what a good mystery should do!  Harry Bosch is at his best here as he searches for answers to his mother's murder.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really enjoyed this show. The quality of the show on Amazon is excellent and I've had no problems so far.
B00AJLHULW|3.0|I've been a Robben Ford fan since his first solo album.  But I have to admit that I have not liked his past few solo efforts. In fact, I have not liked most of what I've been hearing from him the past few years - except Jing Chi.<br />'Bringing It Back Home' falls into the disappointment catagory.  I've listened to the CD about 4 times now, and each time it's over, I don't really remember what I just heard.  Nothing sticks out to grab my attention.  There's not a lot of guitar playing on this CD, which is what he's known for.  And what solos he does do are all uninspired.  So unless he does another Jing Chi CD, I think I'm done.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really enjoy this series. I like the fact that you can get these shows the very next day after they air on AMC.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Bowie's still got it no doubt. This is a great album. Chalk another one down. It's gonna be a classic. Get it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and the streaming quality was excellent. I had no problems at all watching this movie.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|of the ending.<br /><br />Great job with this movie. It is based on a true story. Actors really captured the essence of the movie's message.
0385342039|5.0|OH MY GOODNESS! I have never laughed so hard when reading a book. This book intends to be a comedy and it plays it out so very well. I was snorting, guffawing, chuckling and crying. The writing draws you in and sends you spiraling through waves of laughter, tears of sorrow, shocks of dismay and moments of sheer irritation and panic.<br />Lara Lington is a young, vibrant twenty-something year old Londoner who finds herself without her partner in business (who's suppose to be her bestfriend), without her longtime boyfriend (who she's not over) and without a whole lot on the horizon. Surmounting bills, stress and no prospective future is adding much distress to her life. Then she finds herself at her 105 year old great-aunt's funeral -- which no one in her family visited or seems to remember. She listens to the rude comments of her uncle and aunt who just wish to \\"burn the body and leave\\" when suddenly a voice calls out, \\"where's my necklace?\\"  Lara is shocked to find a young woman in 1920s garb babbling at her about a lost necklace in the middle of the funeral. Lara tries to  ignore the voice but finds she cannot - realizing that the woman is in fact her great-aunt's ghost. So she stops the funeral proceedings stating that she thinks her 105 year old aunt was murdered and thus begins an emotional roller coaster of fun. As Lara and her great-aunt Sadie work together to solve the mystery of a missing necklace, they find a lost love, new love, a sleazy thief and very amazing friendship along the way. Without giving too much away, the absolute best part of the book is when Sadie interferes with Lara's life and forces her to dress in 20s garb for a hot date. I laughed so hard I had tears coming down my face. The saddest (but absolute sweetest) part of the book is the end. Have a box of tissues ready because you will need it. I don't generally stray from favorite genres but decided to give this one a try. I'm so very glad I did. I love the author's style of writing! I had to get use to the British, but it did make the book much more hysterical and fun.o get use to the British, but it did make the book much more hysterical and fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this book before going to see the movie of the same name. It was a delightful romance, nicely colored by a little supernatural angel activity. Who knows?  Maybe the angel was real!
B00BLGDFH2|5.0|Dave Grohl is doing his part in keeping Rock alive and relevant. In fact, this album kicks it into overdrive! Paul McCartney, Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield! This album is awesome!
B004GJYROG|5.0|I'm a huge sports fan and Jordan collector, but until recently I had never seen this movie. What a great movie! It's fun and it's wacky, which means it's perfect for just kicking back and enjoying yourself. My favorite part of the movie was Bill Murray. He's a great comedian and although he is not a star, I really like what he adds to the film.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris was a true American hero. No one realizes what our soldiers and their families go through. A must read for all Americans.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Everyone knows &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; but this whole album is filled with great songs. Macklemore can clearly right some really cool songs that sound great, and this album is the perfect showcase. I bought it when it was on sale for $1.99, and that is a crazy price for something this good! Even for the normal price, this is a must have for any music lover. Note: I generally only listen to rock, and yet I love this whole album.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|While I'm sure this was probably &#34;schmaltzed&#34; up  a bit by Hollywood, it's hard not to like this film. Omar Sy was terrific.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Love this movie.  I have to type 17 words for my review.  OK, very good movie and check out the extras.
1423113462|4.0|My daughter is a big Percy Jackson fan, and she was excited to start the sequel series, The Heroes of Olympus, of which The Lost Hero is the first book. While PJ characters do make guest appearances, the focus of the book is three new characters: Jason, Piper, and Leo. My daughter connected with them almost right away, especially Piper, and we enjoyed reading the book together. She also thought Leo was particularly funny. The plot format is familiar-heroes get discovered, find their way to Camp Half-Blood, and have to complete a quest to more or less save the world. I won't go into too many details here so as to not spoil anything!<br /><br />My only concern is that it might have been a little too mature for her. She never complained, but there is a lot of emphasis on dating, relationships, and various characters' hotness. Now, I must add that I am not typically prudish about such things. However, my daughter is nine--almost ten--and I just don't think she needs to have these concepts on her radar yet. Had I known about this aspect of the book, I might have had her hold off for awhile before reading it--we've also begun spacing out the Harry Potter books to also let her mature a bit, so she can better process some of the plot lines.<br /><br />The minimum age listed by Amazon is ten, but I might have made it a year or two older. But, of course, that is a parent's decision. Just putting the information out there!<br /><br />Guess it is something for my daughter and I to have a conversation about!
B005QUQP76|3.0|I bought this mouse to replace a really oldschool Logitech G5. I really like the feel of the mouse; it's not perfectly symmetrical like most Razer mice; there's a contoured section for my finger and adjustable dpi settings. I'd like to mention in particular that I REALLY like the scroll wheel; it seems to be made of aluminum and has a really nice scrolling feeling to it, though you don't get the extra side-to-side dimension of clicking it.<br /><br />I will say though, that the software absolutely sucks. You can only choose from the preset options for button macros, and setting custom ones often breaks the software and makes it refuse to do anything.
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|The authors writing style is to push new concepts, characters and settings at you without explanation or preparation. You are constantly struggling with this onslaught of highly creative but disorienting fantasy. I felt as if the author was not just arrogant but also sloppy and haphazard. In the end it becomes about the author, not about his characters, who are rarely convincing and seem as lost in the mess as he reader. Not worth the effort.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Hands down the best book I ever read (Harry Potter Series my all time fav). Everyone should read this! I am a 19 year old college student and can relate to everything mentioned in this book. Such an amazing story that everyone needs to read. Will read this many more times! One time is not enough. I am a Wallflower!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Reads like a movie. Sound characters, quite funny, and a little different! It's a nice change to read something based in Melbourne.

B004IOVGW0|4.0|Best part of the picture is the dance routine with the Morris Stoloff orch. playing &#34;Moonglow&#34;, plus the &#34;theme from &#34;Picnic&#34; in the background. Of course, can't forget the &#34;torn shirt&#34; action spotlighting William Holden!
B00AH8FTT2|1.0|No real story and ending absolutely ridiculous. I understood that there were only three books in this series, if correct, I would not have even started to read first one (which I enjoyed).
B008C20TDG|5.0|Even if you aren't looking to overhaul your eating habits, this is just great knowledge to have about how foods are broken down in the body.  In addition, how it may affect how you feel.  I think that it will lead people to make different (and better) choices than they would have.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|a good read -  interesting and funny at times. Recounts historical events in an easy to read way & with a &#34;human&#34; spin...
B000IOM0X8|5.0|I love action and adventure films such as Sahara and this one is no exception.  Once again Matthew McConaughey has given a wonderful performance in this movie. He is excellent as Dirk Pitt.  I can't count the number of times that I have seen this movie, I watch it over and over.  I wish they would make more of Clive Cussler's  novel's into movies and Matthew McConaughey should play Dirk Pitt every time.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Having seen the Netflix version I was curious to see the original.  Well acted and/but disturbing portrayal of the brutality and callousness of politics.  Well worth a watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is very interactive and unique. having fun. nice graphics. keeps you entertained and happy lol. would definitely recommend for others to try.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is an Excellent book it was really inspirational and adventurous and yeah. Buy it okay it was grea t
1881273873|5.0|This book is a must have for singles! I have found my love language and now I have the knowledge to show other love.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|always sharp and Machiavellian.  I highly recommend if you want some witty repartee and some fascinating storytelling twists.  Managing to make an implausible premise seem plausible and then have that premise slowly filter out and effect other characters lives and decision making, while carrying on other known and unknown plottings, has been fun to watch.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|i love this game i haven't want to stop playing it since i got it. don't get it if you don't love the movies it wont be the same.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Based on a real situation, the movie is suspenseful and the pacing is well done.  Does it meet the criteria for a Best Picture &#34;great&#34; movie?  In my opinion, no.  It's a good caper flick.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|This product has insanely spotty functionality and will frequently cause your mouse to disconnect and reconnect...which is beyond frustrating. It seems that the manufacturer has not figured out how to make the battery pack fit the mouse correctly. The mouse works perfectly well with normal batteries so spending the extra 30+ dollars for the same functionality is a complete waste. You are way better off buying rechargeable batteries for half the price.<br /><br />Hope this review saves someone some money.
B008E77AEK|3.0|Not as good as Zero Day but still a good read. There is some jarring stuff such as &#34;Android phones getting jailbroken so that unsigned apps can be installed&#34; that leave a bad taste in the mouth, but it is still a good thriller. While the book offers a really educative peek into the world of computer security, a large part of the narration is simply a spy thriller. The density of computer/software hacking in book is quite small.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Still early after only two episodes but it meets all expectations so far. Great acting, great storylines, true to Viking lore...at least the limited amount I know.
B002NANLCE|2.0|I'd heard if this book from the TV show which looked promising. I was looking forward to reading this and boy did I waste my time.  I can count on one hand the number of things that actually happened. And then when the action finally happened it was a long drawn out action scene at the end of the book. There were some parts that went into too much Physics detail and the book just sort of ended with things up in the air.  I would not recommend this book at all.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Not a boring diary that is typical of military books. It depicts the  personal side of the individuals  that make this true event in history so realistic . Other german aces that are well known to wwii history buffs are much part of this story. This is the best written and researched book that I have enjoyed reading in a long time. You will enjoy this also.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|I enjoy the witty banter and the pacing of this modern version of a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle favorite!  Cumberbatch and Freeman are a great duo.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great music . Very talented and inventive. You won't be sorry if you buy this . Cant wait for their next CD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had a slow start, but once the story started to unravel I couldn't put it down.  Heartbreaking but Incredible!  The ending provided full closure for me which is a MUST!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun game.  I play only at night otherwise I wouldn't get things done during the day.  I'm neglecting My Horse.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A friend recommended this movie to me. This was one of the best documentaries that I have ever watched. The story was intriguing. It made me happy to know that Rodriguez finally has received the attention that he deserves.
0156013983|5.0|Great book for the price.<br /><br />Fine sturdy paper, nice images quality. Great present for French language learners and lovers. I'm completely satisfied.
B001PP9ALY|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch. There was no thinking involved. Not meant to be anything close to &#34;real life&#34;.
1451695195|3.0|While the backstory of Dr. Alexanders book concerning his fight with E. coli meningitis and the support he received from his family makes this book a great read, the bad news is that his claim (which I know he truly believes)for talking to God and experiencing heaven is seriously flawed to every Christian reading his book. To believe him you would have to throw away your bible as being a pack of lies and essentially calling Jesus Christ as being a fraud. Also it would follow, as every Christian knows, that we do not need anything to cover our sins on earth. Just simply die and experience heaven eternal. This thought of course is music to many atheists ears.
B005R32L66|2.0|I prefer talking on the phone over Skype.  All of my computer equipment and cameras are up to date, but I find it difficult to communicate via Skype.  It cuts out, drops calls, and fuzzy images.<br /><br />Room for improvement, and when it does improve, I'll be there!
B000HF6XV8|5.0|This is move became one of my favorites years ago. I always watched it whenever it came on cable, but there were times when I wished i owned it. I was so glad to find it on Amazon, so I bought it right away. The seller sent it on time, and had it packaged very securely. Great movie, great transaction. Thanks, Amazon!:)
B002QRWJA4|5.0|My 14 year old daughter first saw this in band class last year.  She's been looking in local video stores without luck.  She watches this over and over again.  OUr 16 year old son has also watched it multiple times with her.  Very good movie.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I have had my case for about two weeks. It has has been wonderful! The kindle tends to be heavy after using for a while so I love the fact that I can stand it up while in use. It functions as promised and you will not be disappointed.
B000W94FIW|5.0|I read Coelho for his ideas on spirituality and when I read this book I was pleasantly surprised to get a brilliant love story as well.  I love Coelho's ideas an therefore love this book.  It's a riveting story as well.
B009EE4YWI|3.0|What I didn't like about it was most of the things in the book weren't in the movie. And no Kronos Nightmares.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I wanted to learn more about the muslim culture; especially in Pakistan and Afganistan. I do not know whether this author provides a &#34;balanced&#34; look or not but it was very enlightening nevertheless. Well written in a unique style that focused on the lives of two Muslim women.
B009W6OXB0|5.0|Amazing sound in this Vinyl!! you can appreciate a lot more sounds than the regular CD or Download version! a must have to any audiophile fan, a must in your collection!
B000FA675C|5.0|I think Dan Brown is an excellent author. this book was fascinating and held my attention on every page. I love the concept of this story - I love the way he weaves Catholic history throughout the story! Loved it!
B003C1AL8K|5.0|A MUST FOR EVERY AUDIOPHILE COLLECTOR! THE SOUND IS SO DIFFERENT THAN REGULAR CD OR DOWNLOAD VERSION!!! GET IT FROM AMAZON! RARE VINYL VERSION!!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I thought the book was very well written and I actually liked the fighting aspect of the story. I thought the characters were very believable but I just couldn't get over what a disfunctional relationship they were in and kept thinking that even though a happy ending is always what I would want in this case it just didn't seem like the best thing for them. It's like that relationship that your teenage daughter is in and you know that it won't last but you need for her to see it herself.*Spoiler* Yeah but in this case they get married? I just couldn't get over the fact that they should probably lear from this and let go.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I have read it serveral times. I would tell anybody who asks me to be sure and read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had never read anything by Colleen before this book, but wow. It was absolutely amazing. It was heart wrenching and beautiful and was a book that even after I stopped reading for the night I kept thinking about it. (or one instance crying) You just feel so much for the characters and you care so much about what happens to them that you have to keep reading to make sure everything works out. I have already recomended this book to some of my friends and can't wait to talk to them about it.

B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|A rare find to find something so basic to be so engrossing. Pretty to look at. Maybe could use some control interface tweaks and just a hint more interactivity but all in all, great
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great suspense and storyline! Acting is well done and the home and grounds are a beauty to look at, enjoy!
B002RV01QI|4.0|Enjoy her music.  Had other cd's of hers that I enjoyed.  Would recommend to others to buy if you like this kind of music.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I'm watching The Shield again even though I watched every show when new.  It's still a good show and a great cast.  Ahead of its time in many respects.
B000000XB9|5.0|It brings back the old days during the time of the veitnam war with the protest music that came out then.
B0095P29EG|4.0|Good movie, would recommend to a friend. Natalie is so fine in this movie. Liked her charater too. Rent it or buy it.
B009T3AE1Y|3.0|the movie was ok . \\, but hard to follow,neded to  watch more then once. you should rent it before you buy it
B007QDNKQA|5.0|I'm a Wahlberg fan and have been for several years. Graffics and action in this movie are good. Would recommend.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show.  Highly reccomend to anyone who likes history.  Always a surprise and keeps you watching for more. Watch it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. I did get frustrated when I ran out of coins and diamonds but honestly it is great fun. I even recommended it to people at work. I wish the energy wouldn't take so long to regenerate but that is something we all have to live with. Now if the achievements and the new stuff would pop up sometime soon that would be great. I've been playing for sometime now and those buttons keep saying coming soon. When is soon?<br />All in all great game keep the quests coming.
B00942X8PY|5.0|Starts simple but becomes so challenging. Very well designed making a smooth experience playing the game.<br />You can sit down and play a few games without any commitment.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Such a great film! It's action packed and full of suspense. Probably the best 007 movie yet. Daniel Craig does a great job.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Like so many people, I love this show!  The acting is amazing and the story keeps me hooked, every episode.  It seems slow-paced but there are a lot of developments and twists and turns in each episode.  You really see character development and see the good and bad in each character.  My only complaint is that I wish there were more episodes per season!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game. Very entertaining and addicting as well. Keeps u busy . If I have to  say in one word. It be awesome!!!!
B008NEMPTO|5.0|very suprised how well done this movie was , and using the idea of one of our greatest presidents as a slayer was Genius!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is so great to have this social network at my fingertips. I can check to see what my family is up to any time by just one touch on the little blue &#34;f&#34;.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Truly unique show. Too bad its following came too late to salvage the show. At least they were able to make the film \\"Serenity\\" to wrap the storyline up somewhat.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|I had a hankering to watch this but could not find it ANY where!  Thank you Amazon! You're the best!
B001FVV2X2|4.0|This is certainly worth watching. Great story line, love the characters. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little excitement and thrill in their TV shows.
B004EYT932|5.0|Most of think that governmental default from too much debt is a very rare event, indeed. As a matter of fact, we often in financial economics refer to US government debt as the &#34;risk-free asset.&#34; The authors here exhaustively show just how common default by governments really is, and the different mechanisms by which it can happen.<br />A cautionary tale for policy makers and voters here in the US, and in fact anywhere in the developed world, right now--given the high levels of debt we have taken on.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It looks babyish but it is FUN and addicting.The only thing bad is you can not get gems(don't buy the gems not worth it)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty cool.if you don't have room for a horse,this app is fun. Or if you can't afford to rent one. This is the next best thing
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very easy to use, love the option to select any music you want from your library as well as the ability to dim the screen by sliding your finger down the face.<br /><br />I highly recommend you buy this app as you will not be disappointed.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This review was made several months after the purchase.<br />I must say that the controller works perfect!<br />It's an original Sony one bought in a special offer of Amazon<br /><br />Recommended if you need extra controllers or replacements!
B007ZXK08C|2.0|I bought this book because I had read some excellent reviews. In my opinion the test of a good book is that you can't wait to go back to it. Very soon I realised I simply didn't WANT to go back to it. Frankly I was bored. Nevertheless I did persevere but when I was just over half way through I gave it up entirely.<br />Frankly I thought the language was pretty foul and I take no pleasure in reading books like this when there are so many other excellent choices to be made.<br />Many other folk obviously did enjoy the book but for me it was simply a waste of money.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|If you're an Adele fan, this is the concert that you MUST HAVE!<br />At DVD format is excellent, I don't want to know if you purchase the Bluray format!
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Although there's some great acting(Joacin Phoenix is excellent), overall I'd just say this is a weird movie! I don't recommend it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is our favorite show, and we were sad when the season ended! Great acting, great story lines, great everything! Being able to download right from our PC with just 2 clicks?! Um, yes please!
B009IF82SK|5.0|I just love this show, good humor, has real physics facts, and it's not vulgar. This is a rare combination and it's refreshing, I've seen every episode of this show multiple times.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very,very sexy<br />And heartwarming!!! You will fall in love with the characters.. I highly recommend you read all three books
B00797MB0O|5.0|Charlize Theron can play bitchy real good, especially when it's the lead is barely relatable.  Love the scenes with Patton Oswalt.
B00B2064IY|5.0|Without a doubt some of the best music I've heard in years. I only wish he was still alive to ask where it all came from.<br />There are times when listening that you think \\"this is hendrix? ?\\"  And then suddenly you here another bit and then you think \\"THIS is hendrix!\\"
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Dramas that speak to real life today are fun to watch. The storyline and quality of the actors earn this five stars in our \\"abbey\\".
B0034DGPEU|4.0|On the lines of The Help which I loved. Kept me interested. A diversion from mysteries which I read all the time.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The way the two main characters approach love is extremely interesting, and I love how they grow to geniunely care for each other throughout the story.  I haven't finished it quite yet, but I really like what I read so far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not usually the type of book that I would read but it was great! I couldnt put it down!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|69 years old and running from the law on foot or on skateboard!! Loads of fun and very addictive.  I would recommend this game to everyone!!!
B00288KNJU|5.0|coraline is by far my favorite tim burton animation.  The soundtrack to coraline is fabulous as well.  Did you know 'they might be giants' wrote the cute little coraline song?  I thought that was a fun fact :)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a fun game and tests your ability, but be careful, coins cost real money and disappear very quickly if you're not on the ball!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the first book and have started the second.  I was very apprehensive at first as I had heard this book was based on porn.  It is a great story, and it isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  It is more of a love story with some really sexy scenes in it.  I can't wait to read the next two books.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is just like the fair! I just love how it combines it with a puzzle. I would recommend it to everyone.
B000NY17J6|5.0|This oldie but goodie has some nice music. I recommend this for people who also like Bonnie Raitt or Sheryl Crow.
B008PHN6F6|5.0|My 7 yr old daughter loves this movie. Prbly watches it 4 times a week. And I have a sweet spot for it also. Good movie.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It is too simple and seems to have no point.  I do not play it as often as I play the other games on my Kindle.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|got this and at first it connected two days later no connections. So i ordered a 10gbi antenna thinkin it would help. Nope. So i will be returning this product. Definately not happy.
B004UPANGM|5.0|Sam Raimi gets it completely right in this version of Evil Dead.  Taking things slightly less seriously allowing humor and focusing on Bruce Campbell's character's progression.  Classic gory horror.
B00B2TUKI0|1.0|I am a huge fan of \\"Careless Love\\" which was gorgeously executed by actual living breathing jazz musicians.  The Blue Room is awful smushy gunk by contrast.  Reasonable songs ruined by soggy arrangements and poor execution.  I want my money back.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is one of most moving docs I've ever seen.... because of the pure power of the story. Nobody has ever heard of the protagonist, and that's the magic. WATCH IT!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun and family friendly for the little one. Worth down loading and trying it out. The kid's love to see the horses.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watching the second season only makes me more anxious to see the last season - please make it available soon.
B0096HL33G|5.0|It was a wonderful dramatic story and kept your attention through out it all. I love a good story line
B007SOQBCM|1.0|When I first got the app, it worked well. 720p looked great. Now, it won't let me select anything other than 226p which looks absolutely abysmal. Not sure why it changed but nothing I did
B004W1GCNC|3.0|We were looking for Downton look a likes and came upon this through the Amazon recommendations. It was okay but does not have the depth of characters and pace of story line.  I was not interested in paying for season two.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|I really appreciate when an author does just the right amount of research and doesn't beat me over the head with it with it.  I feel like it's just enough explanation of what's going on without boring me with a chemistry or (God forbid, math) class.  It really is a good book even if it's not what I would consider classical scifi.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Gets a little too soapy at times. Overall, nicely evolving plot with historical background that is refreshingly narrated in this social drama.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Loved this on many levels.  Sports, drama, even a love story thrown in there.  Excellent acting.  Justin Timberlake surprised me.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Director Ang Lee gives us a surrealistic vision of a young man sharing a small boat on the high seas with three animals, including a fierce Bengal tiger. There is never a dull moment in this beautifully realized blu-ray film, which is based on the book of the same name. Don't miss it.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Funny and well done with nonstop action.  Never heard of this movie until I rented it, and glad I did.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|It is a awesome game on apple. It always works. On kindle fire it never works. Some internal error that you have been notified of. If you were notified then fix it now! The screen is always black and not responding. IF it works sometimes then the loading bar is never there- just the title screen. Fix it backflip!  Or kindle fires are jacked up.
B00AA0U046|5.0|We all know what this release consists of, demos and practices, but I have the vinyl version and could not be happier. The packaging is top notch and has a nice booklet with info on the songs and is just a great record set. The sound is much improved on the songs I reconize from other releases and this is a nice addition to my Hendrix vinyl collection.
B0098R6M1M|5.0|Saw this movie at a film festival and chose to watch it again.  What does it feel like to be elected Pope?  This movie takes you down that path.  I recommend it!
0517543052|3.0|This book reminds me of the pictures I used to draw while experimenting with natures substances. Lots of drawings and non-sensical illustrations.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is the best series we have watched since the Sopranos.  You have to love those Brits.  Can't wait for the fourth season.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am addicted!!!  Send me to rehab!  I keep downloading more of the angry birds apps and can't seem to stop.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show is awesome, the cast is great! Is a good example of the way people might act in an EOTW situation.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It can be very challenging and addictive.  It's one of the mind games that doesn't get old after frequent play.
B003F9G8B8|3.0|Freeman was good as an African Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon did a good South African Matt Damon. Well directed, solid Clint Eastwood style directing... a bit boring at times, but good.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|It's not really a good game to play on the Kindle.  Its a rather boring adventure with the jetpack joyrider.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I really liked it. I thought it was well acted, full of tension, good directing, suspenseful and edgy. It wasn't all trumped up with 007 style antics and stunts, everything seemed very real. A good addition to Damon's trilogy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Awesome way to learn history and be entertained at the same time. I how the last book can live up to this one
B000053VAF|5.0|I've been searching for this movie for YEARS in all of the local stores, with absolutely no success. I finally came on here and found it! Shipping was fast, it came in perfect condition, and it was exactly what I wanted!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|it's a very interesting and entertaining show.  The special effects are good and the actors have an interesting chemistry.  I look forward to season 2.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I was looking for this for the past two years as a gift for my husband. He's very big into the Batman thing...comics, cartoon show, all the movies, etc. None of the local stores had this exact set but I finally found it on here and just decided to order it. It came in time for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! The picture quality was great, despite what some people have said in other reviews. It came very quickly, the packaging was sufficient so that it didn't suffer any damage while in transit, and it was exactly what I had been searching for! Thanks a ton! It was the perfect gift for my hubby, and he LOVED it! :D
030758836X|1.0|I wish I could get back the time I spent reading GONE GIRL. Staring at a wall would have been a better use of it.  Maybe I could sue the major-magazine reviewers who talked this up?  I came to loathe both main characters. The schmuck is wimpy, needy, hapless and pathetic, and stays that way. The psycho is monstrously self-centered and vindictive, and ingeniously adept at manipulating people who like or trust them -- but collapses like a burst balloon when confronted with someone outside their \\"comfort zone\\" who genuinely has ill intentions. A book with too much cleverness and too little of anything worth remembering, and one of the most dissatisfying endings I've had the misfortune to encounter in a long time. I want my time back, and I want to scrub this book out of my memory.
B00136NUG6|5.0|i love the amazon cloud I play at the Gym whem i'm working out.. i can download to more than one computer
0385344333|4.0|Lee Child's last several novels have been laid in a more continuous storyline than previously in the series. Well, mostly. 61 HOURS ended with a cliffhanger. In WORTH DYING FOR, Child essentially said \\"What cliffhanger?\\" and Reacher set out for Virginia to pay a visit to his female MP phone buddy from 61 HOURS, though he didn't get far. (And by the way, his making it through the apocalyptic end of 61 HOURS relatively unscathed confirms that, yes, Jack Reacher is Superman in disguise.) Then Child interrupted that plotline to chronicle the last episode of Reacher's military career in THE AFFAIR. A WANTED MAN returns to Reacher, in the present day, heading for Virginia again -- hitchhiking; I suppose it's easier to come up with a story that way than if he just took the bus, and also he wants the visit to be a surprise, or something, so he's not calling ahead. Child does a good job of stretching out increasing tension as small details alert Reacher that the people who have picked him up are not who or what they say they are, though there's some implausible business with an eye-blinking code -- a little hard to swallow that Reacher could figure it out, let alone carry on a conversation in it, while staying on the road (he's driving by then). Doing what's right involves a substantial detour from his hoped-for route. There's a bloodbath at the end. Yeah, it's a Jack Reacher book. A WANTED MAN ends with Reacher closer to Virginia but not there yet -- I wonder how many more books it will take for him to get there? Maybe if he ever does, the series will end??
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Good but Support Not Responsive at all. Very quirky app. Not all features work. Wish they had 1/2 decent support...
B000HSKUBE|5.0|I ended up watching the US version with Kevin Spacey first and then I decided I would watch this one.  Loved it.
B000FC1HQY|4.0|Like Jeannette Walls' The Glass Castle, Alexandra Fuller's memoir is the story of a woman growing up with dysfunctional parents and cchallenging environments and triumphs by their sheer intelligence, strength and commitment to their own happiness.  Both do it with respect for their parents, in spite of the parents' serious flaws.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Amazing epic games in Beijing Olympics are a few days ago around Goff the same time of the most important that you have
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought the story was very interesting and held your interest. I would read it again. Thanks for sending it to me.
B001AT4Y84|2.0|No new ground here, if you have seen T1 and T2 then you don't need to go any further.<br />They portray John Connor as so wimpy (and his acting is so bad) that it is unconvincing he'll ever amount to anything.
B009U9S6FI|2.0|This first half of the book was tedious.  Different perspective coming from one of the prisoners being a psychiatrist.  Refuse to read the balance of the book.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was very enjoyable to read. Had mystery, adventure, and drama. Good book Next to watch the movie. thanks
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Ever had that feeling that the micro-USB that came with your ___________ just wasn't long enough? Buy this one and you'll never feel that way again.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love reading about history! Follett is a master at making history come alive with mix of real lives, real loves
B008602KQI|4.0|Read the book. Then watch the movie to help fill in some gaps and expand some stories. Don't read the book and expect an exact depiction on film, though.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a really good  book. I really liked it a lot. It was really nice . I love that book!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Dear friend,<br />I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.<br />Your friend,<br />Charlie<br />👦 + 👩 = 💋

B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennant is Brilliant as the 10th Doctor, and Catherine Tate shines as Donna Noble.<br /><br />for those who don't know, this season introduces us to River Song and the Weeping Angels.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|I love mysteries and this book does not disappoint.  I would happily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries,
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Follower or Sherlock Holmes. This one and the new one on BBC both great updates on chararcter (BBC is one is better) but this is a tv seriers. The one with Robert Downey is a good action movie but not true to Sherlock

0062082353|3.0|Chris Kyle has come to be a symbol of the post-9/11 culture that continues to pervade America's collective psyche. In his various interviews via the MSM in promotion of his autobiographical work \\"American Sniper\\", he comes off as keen to the point of arrogance, yet carries it quite well because he's consistently been on the winning team. His demeanor is that of a plain-spoken, unsubtle bruiser that exists somewhere between a Wild West cliche and a fanatical Football fan who actually keeps himself in decent shape (in contrast to the armies of obese slobs who guzzle light beer and regurgitate NFL statistics) for those inevitable brawls with fans from the opposing team. But most important of all, he is American as apple pie, wrapped in old glory and toting the party line regarding the nature of the world beyond the borders of our comfortable little castle.<br /><br />But whatever controversy or fame may follow this now deceased icon of American jingoism, the question that all should be concerned with is, can the man write a decent book? This question is answered with a resounding NO! Contrary to all the gushing 2-3 sentence, non-descriptive piles of rubbish pumping this book as some sort of captivating endeavor, \\"American Sniper\\" reads like a scatterbrained train wreck of incoherence. In fact, the sentence structure and paragraph format this little package comes in bears a strong resemblance to the eye-sore 5 star reviews littering Amazon since Kyle's death, though there is enough of them that those who can suffer through the grating stops and starts will get a somewhat clear picture of the man's experiences. No ladies and gentlemen, this is not a compelling read, even by the standards of the banal crap that Bill O'Reilly has been churning out of late (I hear he's writing a book called \\"Killing Jesus\\", further underscoring the delusions of grandeur many of my fellow Americans suffer from as they suffer a bumbling blowhard to put the Son of God in the same category as a drunken adulterer in John Kennedy and a corrupt, railroad company crony turned genocidal lunatic in Abraham Lincoln).<br /><br />However, in spite of this being an extremely painful read in terms of quality, pacing and structure, it does convey a needed lesson for those who are not predisposed to clicking their heels and their minds in obedient subordination when the words \\"War on Terror\\" are uttered by a government official, hence the reason why I have favored it with a higher rating than most of the other pseudo-nationalistic drivel that has cropped up in the past 10 years to continually excuse an overreaching interventionist foreign policy. It presents a man who is the quintessential Antinomian fundamentalist who fancies himself a Christian as he seeks to violate God's commandments at every turn, in direct contradiction to more than 2,000 years of established history from the Gospel itself to the teachings of St. Augustine and Martin Luther. A man who brags about the fights he has been in (Matthew 5:39 anyone?), a man who treats the men and even a woman he killed in combat to such endearing terms as \\"savages\\" and \\"barbarians\\" (Matthew 5-7 perhaps?), and one who jokes about depriving non-combatant Iraqis of property without just compensation (Exodus 20:15?). Granted, Mr. Kyle admits to not being a properly catechized man and not terribly schooled in scripture, which goes hand in hand with his conceit regarding how he thinks he will approach God with a clear conscience, something that no man with a proper understanding of the Christian faith would dare mutter for fear of blaspheming.<br /><br />Let this by no means suggest that the author of this review is a pacifist or a hippie by any stretch of the imagination. I have no doubt in my mind that every single one of the 542 invading Russians that Simo H&auml;yh&auml; shot down were justified, because he was not the aggressor. The same can not be said for Chris Kyle's disposition, and his condescending attitude not only toward the insurgents he fought, but also the people that he regarded as innocent civilians reveal a man that probably would have found favor in Stalin's eyes. Instead of an eloquent writer who offers insights into the nature of war, what is presented here is a veritable mouthpiece for American aggression in all regions of the Mid-East, all of it bereft of any intellectual curiosity. Frequent descriptions of tactics and materials employed are offered up, but presented in a way that is both poorly worded (lots of profanity as well) and synthesized into a monolithic narrative of \\"it's fun to kill the enemy, and I'm going to tell you again and again\\". There are some points of interest in the occasional insights provided by CK's wife Tara, most of them relating to her daunting job of raising two kids largely by herself and dealing with a husband that seems less than capable of handling the calm of peace. Suffice to say, I have a newly found sense of pity for every woman married to men in active combat, as well as a sense of bewilderment over why a woman would subject herself to it knowingly.<br /><br />Ultimately what is presented in Chris Kyle is a textbook trustee to what George Carlin referred to as \\"The Male Disease\\", indulging in a highly concentrated assortment of booze, violence and arrogance. While the nature of his recent passing has shocked and confused the unquestioning patriots of this generation, I can't help but put 2 and 2 together and speculate as to how a guy like this actually goes about helping a 25 year old kid who has been to hell and come back with a nasty case of PTSD (a nice technical term for a man being eaten alive by his conscience), even discounting the foolishness of giving a person in said situation a gun to \\"blow off some steam\\" at a shooting range. For those looking to go into the service and protect this country, I ask only that you do some hard thinking about where the borders of the USA actually rest and square it with a conflict far removed from its boundaries where the enemy has no access to an Air Force or a Navy to speak of. And for those who are on the fence about what Chris Kyle represents, try visualizing him as a Russian soldier in the film \\"Red Dawn\\" bragging about how many savages he bagged as they protected their homesteads out in the heartland, and then tell me what you would think of him. But by all means read this book, it is quite instructive, though not for the reasons that most here seem to think.rd the insurgents he fought, but also the people that he regarded as innocent civilians reveal a man that probably would have found favor in Stalin's eyes.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|I can't understand how anyone can make up a story as convoluted as this one, but Gillian Flynn has done just that. It is really difficult to understand what has happened and how in this story, which keeps you hooked in and reading to find out what happens.

B000001Y5J|5.0|When this CD (well, cassette for me!) first came out, it blew my mind.  Up to that point, I was really only heavily into 80s Pop/New Wave, and was starting to venture into other genres.  I was in college, and in the age of grunge and alternative, so I was ripe for a change.  This CD, along with a few others in the 90s, totally changed my musical world. Every time I listen to this CD, I'm overwhelmed by the energy in it.  Sure, there's the anger (and everyone needs an angry CD which comes in handy when you want music that fits your mood!) but there's also so much energy. This is my favorite NIN, above and beyond anything else, and it makes me sad that he's not done anything like it again!  No matter what, I'm indebted to NIN for it, because it encouraged me over the years to investigate harder, louder music and expand my musical horizons.  I don't know that I'd be the metal fan I am now if I hadn't cut my \\"metal\\" teeth on this CD!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|My daughter loved it, Product was just as described and fast shipping. Great for teen girls, seems to be the in series.
B002RI9UBS|1.0|Loved the movie, but omg so hard to get into the book. I couldnt get past the first twenty pages. Too much long tedious back story - it just droned on and on. Maybe if I had kept going I'd have got to some action, but I had too many other books on my pile waiting to be read. Shame, because it is such a clever story. Maybe others will appreciate his writing style more; I just found it hard work.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|For all the 'Fifty' haters out there, just remember there are that many more Christian Grey lovers!  3rd book better than 1st, but not as good as second.
B005HSL626|5.0|I absolutely love this game! For those of you who don't,  don't go off on this big rant about how you &quot;wasted precious mintues of your time&quot; !!! It's  not like you payed any MONEY for it or anything, it was free, for Pete's sake!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is nice to read something different for a change.  You are best off not knowing anything about it before picking it up.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|In haven't been able to put the game Down since I downloaded. I Haven't experienced any problems with the game so far.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I debated wether to read this, I read so many mixed reviews. I truly think you need to read it and judge for yourself. Yes in the beginning of this novel the writing seems a little repetitive and monotonous; however, it does improve and is worth reading to get to the better 2nd and 3rd books of the series.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|The first season of american horror story is fantastic. I highly recommend this to any haunted house/horror story fans. The 2nd season is way more intense, but definitely start with the first!

072325804X|5.0|I am thrilled with this purchase!  I ordered this book to go in my son's very first Easter basket.  Along with this book, I also ordered the [[ASIN:B0017OBHGO Nursery Peter Rabbit, 11\\" Plush Stuffed Animal]] to make story time even more fun!  Although he is only 10 months old, we will be able to enjoy this set for years to come and hopefully pass it down to his children as well.  The cover is gorgeous and has a nice, silver foil font.  The perfect gift for your children or grandchildren!

Watched Part 2 and I love it, the story was dark and gripping. your jaw will drop with the confrontation between Batman and the Joker and the fight between Batman and Superman was intense.

B005CGI4EG|5.0|I don't know why some people complain about the packaging of this box set? C'mon people, for the price of less than $ 30 you get a complete set of all the seasons, that is like $ 2 per disc, then you expect to have a jewel case for that price?

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is pretty fun for a while, but it gets to be pretty tedious in the later levels. If you really want to build up your park, be prepared to spend a lot of time collecting money, leaving the game, then coming back to collect again a few minutes later. Once you hit the mid-twenties or thirties, tasks start taking 4+ days to complete. I ended up deleting the game once I hit level 30 or so because it was taking up way too much of my time to keep progressing.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|If you like WWII history, you need to see this! In fact, EVERYONE needs to see this movie. This is one of the best movies, in my opinion, ever made.

B008IBP24C|5.0|I really enjoy Downton Abbey.  I'm sorry I took so long to get on the band wagon.  I can't wait for season 3.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Further evidence you can acknowledge the tragic nature of trying to survive in today's world without feeling sorry for yourself, or merely whining about your problems. These are expertly crafted, performed, and recorded songs about common concerns of the common man by a band that takes its responsibility to entertain its audience more seriously than it does itself. \\"What About Now\\" is a tight set that rewards dedicated and repeated listens. Do yourself a favor and get the deluxe edition...the bonus songs fit the theme nicely, and are just as excellent as the main album while serving to extend your listening pleasure by about 14 minutes.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This free alarm clock app works very well. The app is easy to use and big enough to see without glasses.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|I purchased this for a carputer I am building, and have only done testing indoors so far, but I was getting a strong signal in my apartment, 40' from the nearest window.  I live on the second of three floors, in a building that uses a lot of steel construction, and this can reliably pick up a movement of less than 6 inches.  I'd definitely get another one of these if I were ever in the market again.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I haven't been pulled into a story as fiercely and completely as The Distant Hours for a long while. It is reminiscent of some of my favorites from childhood:  The Secret Garden and such.  Morton writes with such candor and crafts her characters so as to bring them into that circle of literary friends, fallible, yet unforgettable.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Morrison, Goodwin and Carlisle (sp?) are fantastic.  Wasn't sure about the show at first, we're twilighted/potter'ed out, but it's a good show with its multiple timelines and settings.  It peppers the fantasy/fairy tale premise with the right blend of irony and dry humor.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My grandosn, Joshua, loves this movie and always wants to wacth it as soon as he gets to my house.  When I asked him if I should rent or buy, he said Buy mawmaw I have to be able to watch it again and again so I do not forget it!

B009VIZDLI|5.0|Excellent read in every sense.  Highly amusing, finished it within a day and then reread it immediately for added pleasure.
B0098460O4|4.0|If you followed the story of these two young singers from their quest to be discovered to the point of everyone rooting them to success, you probably couldn't wait to hear their first CD. Although Jonathan is an operatic tenor, the CD is geared on many tracks for pop to appeal to a broader audience. This is not to say there are not very powerful operatic moments. Charlotte has a beautiful voice but clearly more of a lyric than operatic. The vocal mix at times is strikingly out of balance. As though they used volume to give her fullness. This lends itself to running over Jonathan's voice in volume. Having said all this, they are two worlds doing a darn good job to meet somewhere in the middle. Something you're not going to see on a stage. Given that and it being their first CD, there are several beautiful songs. Some showcasing him and some her. They are both talented beyond belief and I can't wait until they each release their own solo album. That's when we'll have the honor of hearing who they are as individuals. Until then you certainly won't be wasting your money on this CD coming from such young talents who have years to own their individual places in music history.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|I am a huge movie buff and I absolutely loved the creativity and the cinematography in this movie. I would have preferred if the movie was not set in a movie theater though, that would have made it easier to follow and connect with what the characters were doing. It definitely helped to have a read the story beforehand as well. Overall, it was a beautiful movie with a touching story.

I'd like to lose 10 pounds and ease my arthritis symptoms.<br /><br />He devotes most of the book to why modern wheat is bad. Fine. But he lost me in the last part by saying you should give up basically all grains. If modern wheat is the culprit, why throw in all grains and raisins and dates with it?<br /><br />I need to see a study, and not anecdotes. I'm sure you can lose a lot of weight following his diet, but that's no different than any other diet out there.

'The White Cliffs Of Dover' and 'Auld Lang Syne' are down to accompany 'White Christmas' later in the year. Cliff and Val Doonican are due to guest on the album. Lost for words really.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|A nice BDSM movie from 2008! I loved the characters, Mr. Grey and Lee. He portrayed a loving dom in this movie. I have watched it several times.
1594488886|5.0|Absolutely loved this from it's simple but delicate style to it's amazing ending that brings all untied ends together. I can guarantee that even the tougher readers will cry by the end if not sooner. This books leaves you with an amazing afterthought, but unlike many books out there, with no questions unanswered. It's so tragic but at the same time beautiful. Never judge a character too soon, they might surprise you - and often do. I don't think Im ever going to be able to watch the cartoon \\"Pinocchio\\" ever again without thinking back to this book and crying like the little girl it made me feel. It taught me how to appreciate what I have in my world as many others don't.<br /><br />Overall both ATSS and The Kite Runner will not leave you untouched, but I have to give credit where it's due (and it may be because I am a girl and liked the romantic suspense) and say that ATSS has made it into my top 10 ultimate favourite books EVER along side notable names like Pride and Prejudice.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|The New Definitive Book for Aspiring Female Execs<br />Who should read this book? Any up-and-coming future female execs who aspire to the C-Suites.<br /><br />I’ve already suggested my MBA-degreed daughter to buy this book and read it. Why? Because Sheryl Sandberg can relate to this ambitious generation of women and inspire them. She is a former Google exec and current Facebook COO, two of the most popular and respected companies in the eyes of the 20-30 something crowd. They will listen and relate to her and I am sure they will be inspired and motivated to follow the advice Sandberg lays out.<br /><br />Best Advice?<br />Sandberg says women should keep their foot on the gas pedal so they can have all the options of career advancement available to them. Don’t pull back, don’t change a career path because you want to have children. Sandberg says too often early career decisions are made with that in mind thereby limiting promotions and opportunities right out of the gate. Sandberg believes that women can have it all… and goes on to tell how she and others have done it.<br /><br />Sandberg is a brilliant woman. She graduated summa cum laude from Harvard, worked for Larry Summers at the U.S. Treasury, is on the board of Disney and was on the board of Starbucks. TIME Magazine ranked her one of the top 100 most influential women; FORBES said she is one of the top 50 most powerful women. The accolades and credits go on and on. If you don’t listen to the insight and wisdom from someone like her, then who do you listen to?<br /><br />Her fellow women should be embracing her in every way and admire what she has done, but sadly her harshest critics are the very women she hopes to inspire and help. For some of them it’s too late; not only do they not get it, they won’t get it. But, for many women this book will serve as the motivating force to keep on moving forward and collectively “Lean In” to improve and change the fortunes of women everywhere.<br /><br />Having now been educated about the sensitivity that women have to the issue of being “Superwomen,” those who have a career and still raise their kids, I’ll never ask the apparently insulting question, “How do you do it?”<br /><br />Sandberg says that fear holds women back;  fear of not being liked, fear of making wrong choices, fear of drawing negative attention, fear of being judged or being a bad mother, wife, daughter. Sandberg preaches “fear not” and “be bold.”  She implores women to ask themselves, “What would they do if they were not afraid?”<br /><br />Other Great Advice:<br />Women should pursue opportunities and seize them rather than reject them and when a not so perfect opportunity presents itself, to instead make the opportunity fit for them.<br /><br />Best Line:<br />“Everyone needs to get more comfortable with female leaders...including female leaders.”<br /><br />She offers great advice for both men and women and cites the important role men have in the success of a powerful woman and conversely that lack of support at home holds enterprising and capable women back.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:<br />‘Lean In’ is an in-depth discussion about women and their careers. It is filled with citations from publications, Ted speeches and quotes and advice from top execs, feminists, politicians, authors and experts from Zuckerberg and Sergey Brin to ‘Tip’ O’Neil, Oprah and Arianna Huffington.<br /><br />This book is the definitive work of its type of the day.  I consider it required reading for all B-School and C-Suite Execs. Buy it and get educated.<br /><br />I am glad to have discovered Sheryl Sandberg and her new book, perhaps as a male I’ll do a little “leaning in” myself.

B00AZM7IQC|4.0|PROS:  Very imaginative costumes and immense talent and creativity, as well as the 3D feature all combine to make this a very entertaining production.<br /><br />CONS:  Picture was a bit blurry at times, especially in the beginning, but cleared up as the show progressed.  As has been the case with most 3D films we've seen, the picture is a bit dark.

1451627297|5.0|The novel 11/22/63, by Stephen King is a time travel novel that begins in the year 2011 in a small town in Maine.  This novel is primarily based around the idea of love and its importance especially within us as humans and it impact within our own history. The past or history within this novel seems almost unchangeable. Time seems to be the dictator of events that take place and it is unimpressed by singular lives (Morris, 1). Time does not exist because of specific events in history such as Kennedy's assassination. This also alludes to the idea that events may be altered. However, because of this idea that the prevention or disruption of an event does not cause bad events to cease but instead, causes a new chain reaction of similar events that would have not occurred otherwise to occur- which may cause a worse result than the prior. This novel includes an important theme of destiny by showing the significance of each event that takes place in life and how it affects the world that will exist after it. This is an excellent book; because it portrays how the events of the past cause specific effects to occur in the future and if those igniting events had never happened then we as individuals, or as a race, may not exist at all.<br />The main character of the novel, Jacob \\"Jake\\" Epping is a high school English teacher and he also works teaching the GED program for some extra money. He decides to accept the mission to travel back in time in order to save President Kennedy from being assassinated and by doing this he has allowed the possibility for his own future to be altered. Each event that takes place in the novel is enveloped around this idea of destiny, for example, when Jake decides to try to save Harry's family from their murdering father on Halloween night 1958. He manages to save everyone except Harry's eldest bother but in hopes of creating a better life for Harry he tries to stop his misfortunes with the murder of his family but when he returns to 2011 he contacts Harry's sister only to find out that Harry was never disabled and therefore he was fit for combat and was killed in the Vietnam War. Therefore, Jake's attempt to save Harry's family resulted in the death of Harry. Even, when Harry's happiness was Jake's motivation to begin with. The theme of the \\"will to choose\\" is also prevalent in this novel and Jake experiences this freedom and its consequences time and time again. Much like in the time travel novel, Kindred by Octavia Butler, there is this idea that every action has a consequence and tampering with the past and the people in it can cause you to simply not exist. For instance, in Kindred when as the reader, you feel that it is wrong for Dana to let Rufus rape Alice, yet Dana realizes something that Jake does not. She understands that it is not her place to change events of the past because not matter how immoral Rufus's actions were if he did not rape her then other events in history would not have taken place. Which in this novel, would be the existence of Dana herself- she is the direct descendant of Hagar, the illegitimate child of Alice and Rufus (Butler). Therefore, if she had interfered with this \\"forced union\\" then she would have actually blotted her own life out of existence, just as Jake's well-intentioned attempt at preventing the murder of Harry's family actually caused Harry to die prematurely. Therefore, there is this idea that no action of free will or of choice goes without a reaction or consequence to a decision that is made.<br />King does a phenomenal job entwining real facts of history with his own twist of horrifying love. Or this idea that trying to change an event to save the one you love or to help make a situation better actually poisons the situation that seemed bad to begin with. Just as Jake is so focused on Oswald and his actions within the novel, King being focused on the fate of these characters just as Oswald's circumstances created the monster that he was, the events throughout time have created the history that we have. As mentioned before, every action has a consequence and every event in history has an outcome and what King seems to portray in this quote as Jake states, \\"I said nothing. I had been worried about going back, but now I was afraid, as well. Is there any phrase more ominous than you need to see exactly what you've done? I couldn't think of one offhand\\" (King, 798). This novel in its entirety is a tribute to life and to events that take place that we may not understand and yet they are necessary. The years past, and the events contained within them are required to secure the existence of the world as we know it or for our own existence and security as humankind.<br /><br />Works Cited<br /> \\"11/22/63.\\" Wikipedia.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I loved reading this book. I have so much respect for what Chris and others do for this country. I loved the humor Chris added to the pages. When I finished the book I felt as if I knew him personally. So sadden by the news of his tragic death. Semper Fi.
B00364K6YW|5.0|My favorite book has been made into a movie many times, this one is super! Captures the era of romance, magestic horses, rolling country side, carriages to dream about... sisterly bickering, tongue in cheek banttering between the mother and father, snobish sister... the whole scene is there! Must see movie, grab a pot of coffee and enjoy.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey boasts some of the best actors in theater and the industry, it's appropriate to the time period, and the struggle between the social classes is at times, barely palpable, and at others, an egregious tension. Thumbs up in every way.
B008EPI5CI|5.0|I love Lila Down's majestic interpretation of classical Mexican music. Pecados Y Milagros is an eclectic album whose songs Lila sings with her characteristic passion and elegance. Her voice transports me to a place of love and mundane transcendence. Her rendition of Tu Carcel is both melancholic and nostalgic which brings me to tears every time I hear it. Xochipitzahua is so beautiful it is reminiscent of Ave Maria and will give you goose bumps. Zapata Se Queda is both fun to dance and meaningful in its message. Lila beautifully renders homage to the sacred process of employing the Comal to make the food which nourishes us, and to the amazing women whose hands work over the sacred comal in Palomo Del Comalito. And what more is there to say about all the other beautiful, artistic, heavenly songs she sings in this fantastic album, they are all simply beautiful. Bravo Lila, keep up your God given work. Te amo!

B004LWZW7E|4.0|Very interesting concept, where time is literally money and once you're out, you're literally out, as in dead. Sadly, I can see this being a concept that the future government may consider one day. It's very interesting and sad, very futuristic. Worth watching at least once or twice.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Very good read. Good character development and not much pedestrian writing. I enjoyed the detail book goes into and plan to see the movie again.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Channing Tatum's first comedy is hilarious. He is definitely more fit for comedies than tragic romance movies. I loved the movie and what made it authentic was bringing in the original characters from the 80's tv show towards the end (Johnny Depp:) and it was suggestive of a sequel, though I'm not sure how that will go.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show it is very funny for me and you would enjoy it but there are some twists that you wouldn't expect.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Before this was on netflix, and just playing on tv, I wasn't too interested in watching it, as shows have dwelled on that concept already, many times. However, one day on netflix, I chose to watch an episode and have been hooked every since. This show is awesome and I love the characters in it. I had to get my own copy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|In my opinion, its a little difficult and you have to get used to it. Once you do it gets pretty addicting and hard to put down.
B0001I561E|5.0|A childhood favorite; my husband and I join in on the singing and wish to one day share this with our children.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing story line, fantastic acting, beautiful scenery and costumes - would highly recommend this series to anyone that enjoys a great well acted journey.
B008518MOW|5.0|Was a bit expensive online but am happy to have purchased it. i love this movie and am so glad they made a part three. Such a twist in the end, keeps me wanting to watch it again and again. Great movie
B009GX6SSK|4.0|Just good old entertainment!  Love it!  I fear too much 'personal' information about characters will make it hard for me to watch.  Too much personal information makes me shy away because I fear something negatiive or hurtful happening to characters I love.
B0060D2WYI|5.0|This movie never gets old.  It is so magical and the animitronics are great!  It still holds up today.  The special effects don't look bad and it is a great story.  I highly recommend it to any OZ lover.
B00B23O96A|1.0|Come on Eric.  What happened to the awesome albums that you released such as Behind the Sun, August, Journeyman, Riding With the King, Reptile, From the Cradle, Pilgrim...I can go on...<br /><br />This album and your previous album from 2010 are sub-par releases from someone who once was referred to as a perfectionist.  Who, at one time, performed your concerts in suits.<br /><br />My suggestion is that you collaborate with some individuals out there and I hope you work really hard over the next few years to produce something awe inspiring for your fans.  I am not asking for pop music, but I am also not asking for elevator music.  I am asking for incredible music with great riffs and jams that are blues oriented...something that is your signature music...
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I was disappointed but maybe kids would like this.  It takes a little coordination but not very complicated.  At least it was free.
B0009Y33H4|3.0|At the end of the 70 all artists published double live album. And it took the Van Der Graaf. Vital came out, an album as opposed to other trcords or s<br />Still life. The sound is dirty, mixing treated badly, sometimes you do not understand the instruments. The show that came out of the Marquee in London was captured and put on disc without cleanups. The strength is the point of connection with the other albums.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The only downside to this series is waiting for the next book. Glad I came into the series later, I burn through these like paper.
B004RKXNDU|1.0|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is at least 30 years old.  You can purchase a used paperback version for $.22.  So why is Amazon gouging Kindle owners by charging $12.99 for the Kindle version?  The simple answer came on today's news.  Amazon has dropped the price of the higher end Kindles, with the hope of making up the difference with higher prices on content downloads.  Not a nice way to treat current customers!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Puts the HBO series to shame, so glad i was too impatient waiting on the next episodes and picked up the books.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|This is one of the best novels I have read for quite some time.  The characters are very real, the story is fascinating and the writing is excellent.  It also gave me a what I believe is a very accurate ideal and feel for how it is to live in India, for what India is really like.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After watching the first season..i got the hang of it. And if people like history; they will love how knit they story of this family relate to the past of the member from royal society from England on that time.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Good feeling having Bowie back, isn't it? Or maybe it isn't. See, this is the thing about David Bowie: the extreme reactions his music provokes. Browsing through these reviews, I was quite entertained to learn that this might be simultaneously the best thing the man has ever done and the worst piece of crap ever produced in the history of music. Please, enough mincing words. How do you really feel, people?<br /><br />Not that I'm entirely free of biases, mind you. I have some history with the guy after all. When I was a kid, a fantastic song showed up on the radio one fine spring day. It was called \\"Let's Dance\\" and it was sung by an artist I'd never heard of called David Bowie. Except that I HAD heard of him. After reading a music magazine article just a few weeks later I was astonished to discover that this guy not only had a whole brilliant career in the previous decade, but that I'd actually knew several of his songs by heart already--Starman, Golden Years, Ashes to Ashes. (And this was in the Communist Poland, for Pete's sake!) Over the next thirty years (insert something panicky here about getting old!) I still listen to his records on a regular basis. His music soundtracked many events in my life, good an bad. But his songs almost always made me pay attention. In fact, it would be fair to say that this man's sense of artistry has inspired me more than any other recording artist with the exception of the Beatles.<br /><br />The new album? First off, I'll admit it: I didn't think we'd ever hear from Bowie again. So the sudden appearance of Where Are We Now back in January startled me. I was slightly disappointed at first--very slightly--before the wistful majesty of the song revealed itself to me. In a way, this was my experience with the whole album. Now, after about ten listens over the last couple of weeks, almost every song has managed to take a firm hold of my imagination. One thing that struck me immediately: Bowie has a lot more to say lyrically than hehas in a quite a number of years. And then there is the music. No, these are not the best melodies of his career, but about as good tunes as you can expect from the man who literally has done it all before. What surprises me the most is how some of these songs haunt you once you get them in your head: I haven't been able to shake off You Feel So Lonely You Could Die, The Stars Are Out Tonight and Valentine's Day for a couple of days. I enjoy his willingness to throw us curve balls--like the motif from The Shadow's Apache popping up in the middle of How Does The Grass Off. There is a refreshing sense of purpose and urgency here, too: a song like Love Is Lost emerges fully formed with the kind of pent up intensity we haven't seen from him since his cocaine days. It says something about the man's state of mind, doesn't it? In fact, I would venture to say that the ONLY REASON this album exists is because David Bowie really wanted to make it. And that's more than can be said for a lot of other artists.<br /><br />So here we are, all these years later into the space age and Bowie is still stirring my imagination--and listening to this album feels like having an old friend unexpectedly stop by. No, The Next Day is not going to go down as his masterpiece. But so what? David Bowie already did his part to change the course of popular music. And then some.
1401322786|4.0|The Time Keeper by Mitch Albom brings to light deep moral and ethical questions while exploring a concept that humanity has struggled with since its discovery- time and the uncontrollable passage of it. Albom's novel is successful because of its ability to, through simple language and easy to follow, objective plot development, relate large audiences to the deep thought of time, its passage, and humanity's inability to control it.<br /><br />The novel opens with Father Time, who we first meet in a cave listening to the pleas for time from Sarah Lemon and Victor Delamonte. Both fear that time is running out because of their various situations. Both people's wishes drift to the cave where Father Time, formerly known as Dor, hears them but can do nothing but listen.<br /><br />As Dor discovers a way to measure the progression of existence, or time, he is also faced with the responsibility that comes from this knowledge. Though a humble, loving, and simple man, Dor enters into the realm of control over one of God's most treasured gifts. He soon comes to understand that the realization that time is passing is one of insurmountable burden, and that though he may be able to measure time, he can do nothing to slow it down. God is displeased with Dor's developments of controlling time and has created a way for Dor to be punished for his attempts.<br /><br />After thousands of years in the cave, Dor is given the opportunity to change the lives of two people who also wish to control time. Dor's intervention in these two peoples' lives indulges in the ideals of time, the control of it, and the ethics surrounding both time and death.<br /><br />The main theme of the novel is time and the passage of time, while also indulging in death and certain moral and ethical principles. From Dor's attempts to measure and thus control time to Sarah and Victor's attempts to make time move at their desired pace, Albom drives readers to question the ways in which they allow time to pass beforethem. The novel causes the reader to understand that time is not controllable for any human person, but that through relationship to another time will pass in ways that are either better or worse than when one solitarily experience time's passage.<br /><br />Many writing techniques are at work in the novel, harmonizing it into a convincing and attainable work. The background stories and development of the characters grab the attention of a wide variety of people, thus strengthening the novel's relatability and success. Historians and intellectuals can relate to the character of Dor and his placement in primitive Earth. Young or lonely women can relate to the character of Sarah and her desperation in seeking love, attention, and care from others. The character of Victor is relatable in many aspects concerning his age, social and economical status, and health. Albom's development of the characters along with their incredibly varying circumstances and stories make the novel itself relatable to readers and draws in multiple audiences, thus increasing dramatically the strength and success of the novel.<br /><br />Albom writes in an incredibly simple format with easy to understand language, allowing the reader to get through it quickly while also divulging in its deeper themes. The ease of language allows it to be attainable to a wide audience, and thus the rich ideals of time and death can sink into the minds of a wide variety of people. The novel forces its readers to think about the passage of time and creates in the reader a desire to cherish more the sweet time one has while on Earth. Through the focus on time, the reader is also forced to think about ideas that stretch beyond simply time on Earth, like what happens when one's time on Earth is up and where one goes after death happens. Albom's attainable language causes any reader to think deeper about life and the meaning of it.<br /><br />The setting of the story allows the reader to understand that they are entering into a story that incorporates all of humanity and a problem that has encapsulates humanity's entire existence. We can see through Dor's elongated existence that the struggles with the concepts of time faced by people of the modern era have been wrestled with since the human discovered the steady rate at which existence continues. Through applying an ancient person's story to people of modern times, the reader is able to understand the importance of the questions associated with time and thus allow the reader to indulge in a deep, and somewhat moral, discussion.<br /><br />The speaker's point of view also plays a vital role in the novel because of his almost complete omniscience. This is of benefit to the reader because the reader can then open-mindedly approach the various characters' decisions while also relating to them and applying them to their own life. Even in a seemingly \\"fantastic\\" story line, the circumstances presented by the novel become attainable.<br /><br />One of the biggest faults of the novel is its suspension of disbelief. Though a reader could find the circumstances of the stories relatable, the concepts that drive the protagonist to his position are not necessarily accurate or universally accepted. Though the novel is clearly fiction and is thus allowed to dive into the realm on unreality, historical accuracies are important to a reader's reception of the novel and thus cause The Time Keeper to become less attainable to certain audiences.<br /><br />The importance of humanity's inability to control the passage of time is the most crucial development of the novel. Though the novel has some downfalls, the strengths of it work well to development this idea and its downfalls can more or less be overlooked in order to arrive at the most crucial theme. Albom's plot, setting, and overarching theme work harmoniously to create a work that is both attainable and thought provoking, allowing large audiences to relate and think deeper about such abstractconcepts as time.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This was a GREAT movie!  It hard a little of everything... comedy, action, drama...<br />For the older crowd, it was great reminder of the games you grew up playing, yet it still had all the goofyness you expect for the kids.  Definitely a must-buy.
0345803507|5.0|Loved the whole trilogy. Highly recomend these books if you want romance, adventure, and just an overall good story. I wish there were more than three.
1596680296|4.0|I thought this would be the perfect book to get me going on knitting socks. Nope. I guess I need someone sitting right beside me for this. Maybe YouTube and this book will get me on my way to knitting my first pairs of socks.
B004D2GMR6|5.0|I baught this dvd for my wife be ause she likes him I think he playes good rock an roll
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is amazing.  I'm not a big fan of historical shows, but this one is the exception.  The stories involving both classes are both completely convincing and enthralling.  Not only do you feel for the characters, both noble and working class, but you also see how the world and war around it affect everyone differently.

B000Q6GUTI|5.0|it is a movie that I saw in the movie house I thought it was worth having in my collection
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A friend gave me this book and said I \\"must\\" read it and I admit I was interested after all the hype. I struggled (meaning - forced myself) through the first 25% thinking it just had to get better but I can no longer put myself through this torture. First of all, the writing is extremely juvenile and secondly, the characters are so unbelievable and unlikeable that it's amazing this book got any play at all. Don't waste your time. Seriously.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|seen the movie in the movire house injoyed it so I got it for my grandkids I know they will like it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|at first i thought it would be lame but then so many people we're talking about I started to think it was awsome

B005S9EJ14|5.0|Elderly people from England go to a &#34;retirement hotel&#34; in India and discover the situation was &#34;slightly&#34; misrepresented. Fighting culture shock, most gradually adapt and learn to love their new home.  Favorite line - &#34;Everything will be fine in the end.  If things are not fine, you are not at the end.&#34;  (Sorry if I misquoted it, but the meaning is close.)
B0031RAOVY|5.0|So heart warming. Anyone who has, and for those who have not owned a pet, this is a must see.
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|I don't really know what people are complaining about. In fact I am very confused. I opened this thing up and paired it with my computer is a matter of seconds. Before I knew it I was playing Cave Story with the buttons mapped and having a blast. This is an awesome little portable game pad.<br /><br />I read a comment that said it didn't work with the computer at all. I don't know what that person was doing, but I bet they were doing it wrong. It installs itself automatically once paired and then the only thing left to do is map the buttons in-game.<br /><br />Now, I am not using this for my android device because, let's face it, that's kind of silly. The point in gaming on a phone is to have ultimate portability... only the phone. However, I have not tried it with a tablet and do not intend to.<br /><br />All in all, if you're getting this to work with your pc then you are making a good choice. I was able to get this used, which I am happy about. Must have been some disgruntled person who didn't give it the time of day. I saved 10 bucks!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Triggers do not work on PC<br />No application for PC<br />NYKO does not officially support PC even though they say it will work<br /><br />Pretty great pad, but also sort of disappointing because it has so much incredible amounts of potential! Why not support PC? It just seems like poor planning! There is so much this controller could do but it falls so short. It's merely just a programming problem. With a decent Windows Application it could be amazing.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|AFTER YOU SEE THIS AND READ THE BOOK YOU'LL BE ON A PLANE TO TAMPA TO SEE THE REAL THING.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book! I could not put it down! I would recommend this book to anyone - regardless on if you like to read or not, you will enjoy this book.
B001992NUQ|5.0|I saw this in the theater at the old Cinerama Dome in Hollywood and have owned every DVD release/version that has been out, this is by far the best version, either the quality digital transfer or the quality of blu ray ad modern hdtv or both, but this blu ray came out great. Th small things like early Tyler Durden references and the 7 Year In Tibet Marquee in downtown LA really pop in this version. Fan of Fight Club or if you think this is Fincher's best work (which most do) than get it, it's worth every cent.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|Following the story line is NOT!  I really don't know WHY the TV and Movie people have to veer off from the original story lines, and add characters that were never there, or change their names.  MEH!  HBO is really irritating the heck out of me by bastardizing great writing (i.e. &#34;Sookie Stackhouse&#34;  books and &#34;A Song of Fire and Ice&#34; saga).  Of course, IF you can see it as something else, then it's ok, I guess.  For what it's worth, Peter Jackson's &#34;LOTR&#34; and &#34;The Hobbitt&#34; movies are just as perverted from the original story, if not worse.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I downloaded this game for my three year old, but I won't let him touch it...totally addicted to it. The only flaw I see is that it is about impossible to earn acorns, except when you get lucky at Scrat's game.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Easy to play.  Exciting graphics.  The different levels keep you from getting bored with one game.  This game even keeps children entertained.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I loved this book. This is the second time I read it and it was just as good. I recommend this book to everyone.

B001P1MZNI|5.0|Good concert with Sinatra singing and throwning some jokes around, good record quality. Comfortable download and sync options from the cloud.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|i thought movie was made complicated by introducing many characters but isn't great when it comes to climax. quality of the digital copy was average and i paid $10 bucks so thought it wasn't worth the money.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|As usual with Amazon mp3, good quality mp3 with comfort of nice soft and options to sync from the cloud.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Yeah there were some typos going on, but nothing too bothersome. The stories were fun. It would have been nice for the table of contents to include links for easier navigation through out the collection, but that was really my only complaint.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|Too improbable to be interesting. Tom Cruise consumes every frame of the movie without contributing a single shred of acting.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just finished minutes ago.  Compelling read, a psycho novel that keeps you committed to a logical solution.  Surprise climax, not really.
1577311523|5.0|This book is touching the depths of everyone in unbelievable way. It will make you see the simple fact of you.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Honestly I hear a lot of people say it's controversial or whatever the case may be. But if you genuinely understand the book and its messages and its lessons then you can make major moves. I will read this book many more times in my life and treasure and implement its teachings.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Bought this mic hoping it would be a good interview mic. The highly rated reviews had me convinced but the mic ended up in the trash. When I first received it, I read all the directions and its basically just a plug n' play right into the audio jack on your camera/computer. Well. It was an utter failure for both my computer and camera. The mic could barely pick up any sound and most of the sound it picked up was ruined by a loud hissing sound. I watched tons of tutorials on how to fix or correct this but it still never worked. Even went out and bought an $8 replacement battery but that didn't do anything to improve sound. I was so unhappy with it that I just threw it away and bought a blue yeti mic that is well worth the money
1400069807|2.0|It seems as if this author wrote each section as a stand alone essay, and as the years passed in research he--and his editor--neglected to cross-reference what was previously written.  Quite often he wastes sentences revisiting concepts, anecdotes, and key players as if he were telling us for the first time.  Such passages are never verbose, but their regularity becomes distracting after time.<br /><br />Furthermore, the author does little to reveal the world of the consumer.  We do not enter the house of a \\"heavy user\\" or travel to the doctor's office with a young child recently diagnosed with type II diabetes.  As an MBA student I was glad to read about the corporate perspective concerning food production.  However, the dearth of information from the other size of the freezer window left me feeling that this author's narrative was hollow and incomplete.<br /><br />I have come to loathe marketing as a profession, especially where that marketing concerns food.  The marketing budget for food is built into the cost of each item.  In essence, food companies are charging us money to convince us to buy their products.  Food products should stand on their own merit.<br /><br />I would not begrudge a person reading this book.  If you are overweight it may provide the impetus you need to choose healthier foods.  However, each and every person that eats highly processed food--in their heart of hearts--knows that they are not good for you.  Instead of taking the time to read this book, you may be better served to read the labels on your food and some statistics concerning obesity, high blood pressure, etc.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app.  I dont require anything overly complicated or fancy, and this app suits my purposes very well.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|How many movies have you seen that can hold your attention for three hours straight?  I was transfixed by this fillm which was perfectly cast and a delightful experience.  Tom Hulce was captivating as Mozart but I was absolutely fascinated by F. Murray Abraham and his portrayal of the tormented court composer, Salieri, who looked upon the young Mozart with both disgust and reverence.  The interplay between him and his ongoing feud with God was brilliant as was the conflict over why this &#34;creature&#34; Mozart was blessed with such heavenly and seemingly effortless talents, when he himself was destined for mediocrity and anonymity despite working so hard and devoting his very life to God.  Do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful film.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Didn't care for the writing style. I couldn't much relate to the characters even though I was in 9th grade the same year as Charlie. His choice in music was horrible. I wish we knew more about his mom and her silence. Did she know about the abuse?
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This is such a great movie, right when you think it is getting cheesy they do something hilarious! I am so glad I rented it and I really want to buy it!

B00B4VXQC8|5.0|For all of the people hating this album and saying its not like Bon Jovis past work, think about. Its not big hair band 1986 and rocking out to Slippery! This is 2013.You gotta remember, people mature in life. Bon Jovi isn't always gonna be 20 and singing about girls and partying. They are mature,have families, and life problems. I think this album has some of their early 2000s work along with some of todays music. Its has great,energetic songs, then has some classic Bon Jovi ballads. Overall, I think this is a great album.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a wonderful story. I really enjoyed this book, and the character Pi Patel. And of course, Richard Parker.

B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci never disappoints!  It was qute the page turner and I enjoyed the character of John Puller very much.  In fact as soon as I finished it I bought Forgotten to see what is going on in Officer Puller's life now.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This is the best season so far.  With the main characters universe-hopping, we are left with brainwashing (and drying), betrayal, and cosmic mysteries in addition to the usual Fringe investigations.  If you like science fiction, fantasy and drama, catch Fringe.
B004WW88BK|5.0|Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Heard great things about it and was not dissppointed!  Love the UK version.  Looking forward to Season 3 being available to Amazon Prime customers!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This was a very fun book to read. My early teen and tween students quite enjoyed the imagination of this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are improved and the game has more twists and turns than the first game.  It is lots of fun.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Talk about a movie that has no point! I still don't really know what it was about. Waste of time.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|I could almost love it if I could get my head around something from nothing...but then I am not Lawrence Krauss.  At the end I still felt that there was something missing but there always is...Isn't there?
0545265355|5.0|such a great price for all three books, i love the series and this set helped me read through all of them
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This games is more challenging for the kids in the house, however it has not stopped them from having competitions.  Also BEWARE PARENTS, set the security on your game so that your little ones don't spend mega bucks upgrading their characters!!!!!!!
B004GTOKJS|5.0|As previously,really enjoyed this....growing up in England the BBC used to air excellent dramas every Sunday evening...such as 'Ivanhoe', 'Hereward the Wake',all the classic Charles Dickens and the Bronte novels,just to name a few....Thank You Amazon for making such high quality programming available on 'Prime&#34;!
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Really interesting documentary about an American musician who didn't really make it in the U.S. but unknowingly was a HUGE hit in South Africa.
B00821OX98|4.0|Why is it that just when a good series like this, or any number of short lived shows I have liked over the past few years, just seems to get its act together, they pull the plug on it? That is the only dissapointing thing about this show, theres not enough to finish the story.
B00BHU2A7I|1.0|I was really looking forward to this film but man was I disappointed.  I'm almost thinking it was supposed to be funny and I just didn't get the joke.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This show keeps getting better and better! With lots of drama and suspense, this show always leaves you wanting more! Can't wait for Season 3!
B006RXPUR2|5.0|Ben Affleck is some film maker!  And his brother, Casey, is some actor!  I thought this was a terrific film!
1616550414|4.0|Almost everything you could ever want to know about the Legend of Zelda series is contained in this book.<br /><br />Would get five stars, but there are minor errors in it. Oh well. Hopefully they'll be fixed in a future edition.
B000Y0Q5NM|3.0|The box that the DVDs come in came damaged and looked worn. If it didnt have the original shrink wrap I would have thought it came used.  I love this series too much though to let that bug me enough to send it back.
B0007XT87G|4.0|After discovering Porcupine Tree, am buying the entire catalog. While not my favorite, still has lots of strong material-wish it had a 5.1 mix available.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy movies in this time period. Good story line. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of setting.
B0013URJTG|5.0|Really getting into Porcupine Tree. The surround mix is phenominal! Steve Wilson is a genius. Russia on Ice will knock the dust out of your subwoofer. All chanels are well mixed and sound great.
0062127241|2.0|Pete Townshend may well have created the anti-Rock Star memoir here - long on details, at least to an extent, but told with all the flair and style of a court stenographer.  Indeed, the pedestrian style of this tome is shocking coming from someone who once worked for a publishing house, and has described himself over the years as \\"brilliant\\" (and his band-mates as \\"yobbos\\").  What are we to make of someone who reduces the story of Keith Moon's 20th birthday party - which featured flying cakes, substances of all types abused, and a Lincoln Continental inches from capsizing into the pool - into a bland paragraph?<br /><br />Throughout the many pages, it's clear that Townshend was frustrated with and felt chained to The Who, a band ever so much more than the sum of its parts.  Clearly Townshend resents his association with The Who more than he appreciates the adoring fans and monstrous checks for the perennial \\"farewell\\" tours (for the record, the first being in 1982!)<br /><br />One thing the book doesn't skimp on is names - a galaxy of dropped famous names who've rubbed shoulders - and other parts - with Pete, a number that exceeds the mentions of his studios...boats...girlfriends...<br /><br />At least we get some limited glimpses of his band mates along the way: Working-class Roger Daltrey, hard-working and dedicated;  insecure little kid Keith Moon, always desperate to please and devastated by the failure of his marriage; and Thunderfingers John Entwistle, who spent every dollar he ever earned, including the $1-million advance for the 2002 tour he never played, dying in a Las Vegas hotel room from a combination of cocaine and heart disease days before the kickoff.<br /><br />Anyone interested in Who trivia and anecdotes, including a lot of stories that Townshend doesn't tell here, should read \\"The Who - Maximum R&B\\", written by Townshend's long-time friend Richard Barnes.<br /><br />A brilliant song writer Townshend may be - but without the music, his words fail to impress or inspire.
B000056HUA|4.0|Always my favorite Doors album. I try to find as much 5.1 music on SACD or DVD-A as I can. The Stereo mix is different than my older copy-better I think- The 5.1 mix is enjoyable, but not remarkable. I would still buy it again.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is like an otter box for your kindle i love it! Im so clumsy so this will deff help!
B00APUYN0I|2.0|It is a video for the younger crowd.  I was ready to turn it off after the first five minutes. It has a very weak and predictable story line and not worth watching.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I purchased this for my eleven year old, but I ended up reading it instead.  The book is definitely dark and twisted, but it was not depressing.  Great character development.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An awesome game for all ages and is a fun time waster i would give  this six stars if i could
B008673ZAQ|3.0|A little darker then fifty shades of grey as far as the main male character. yet i still kept ready to find out more
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|To say I adore this adaptation of Jane Eyre would be an understatement. I've watched this DVD probably 5 times. I appreciate that the director got to the heart of the story and didn't drag us through a lot of things from the book that just don't work on film. The actors are age appropriate. The actress who plays Jane is about the right age and she has an ethereal quality about it. When Mr. Rochester tells her she has the look of a caged bird about her, I almost swooned. It was perfectly delivered.... I hope whoever was behind the camera received an award for this, becuase his / her work is spectacular. The way they catch the candlelight conversations makes you feel that you are right there with them.
B00846REIS|3.0|A little darker then fifty shades of grey as far as the main male character. yet i still kept ready to find out more
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|i'm live in russia, GoPro Hero3 Red Dive Filter-Snap On this accessories put on the camera is good Thank you very mush!

B007SGM084|5.0|Fun, Sexy, and adventures that keep you wanting to read. My entire Sunday was lost in these books, but I'm not complaining!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|When I finished all levels, &amp; want to play more, game levels were gone, deleted. HELP I want a answer Thank You. necerl@aol.com
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this entire series. Would recommend to younger adults / tweens. It will pull you in and make you want to read more and more. Now the movies are coming out as well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game easy to play. My daughter and I love it. The one thing we don't like is that after level ten there are annoying pop up ad's. That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 a five star rating.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Downloaded quick and easy. No Hassles. Cant wait for the next season! Would recommend to anyone who likes twists and surprises in a tv series
B007U4DDXK|5.0|This is the best one of all 3, and my grandkids love it also.<br />My great grandson watch it 5 times the frist day.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this entire series. Would recommend to younger adults / tweens. It will pull you in and make you want to read more and more. Now the movies are coming out as well.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it.  It is easy to use and llows me to read a variety of books in different languages.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Enjoyable love story, easy to predict the end, read it in 1 day and filled my relaxing Sunday.<br />I can surely recommend it, if you just want to drift off and relax your mind.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This movie sheds a lot of light on the things that occurred in that time. I would highly recommend it.
B009LXECF6|5.0|This album contains a variety of different genres of music. Would recommend to anyone! You will not regret getting it.
0385342063|3.0|I have no idea what Poppy looks like, all I know is that she is impulsive, insecure and supposedly cute.<br />I have no idea what Magnus looks like, except that he is apparently very attractive with nice longish hair, but not ponytail length.<br />I know Sam has messy looking dark hair.<br /><br />The premise is cute albeit unbelievable so you really have to cut the story a lot of slack to get through it. I don't recall Poppy having a patient appointment at all during the book - and it didn't seem to impact her at all. She at times seemed very clever and intuitive and other times seemed very naive and immature.  There were a few moments that made me smile, but overall the story was rushed and it was easy to tell what would happen at the end, even if you didn't know HOW it would happen.<br /><br />I got the Kindle version and there was a notice that appeared at the beginning discussing the footnotes and how click on them and then how to get back to the story.  I have to say, I actually hated the footnotes. I don't think they added anything to to the story and it was really annoying to click back and forth and sometimes I just ignored them altogether only to find them all listed at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />It was a light easy read.  I wasn't quite as annoyed with it as other readers, but I do agree the characters were quite one dimensional and many of the situations were unrealistic.  I found the scene with them in the woods to be particularly strange.  Why did Sam go into the woods anyway?<br /><br />I'm glad I borrowed this one from my public library's digital collection.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great entertainment!  I watch with my teenage daughters and we are enjoying the show and getting alittle history lesson at the same time.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|I loved the speed of the show, the action, and Summer... The only real let down is finding out that it was a separate storyline. And Shirley Manson is a waste of skin.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|The book is easy to read, chock full of tidbit information. I love when I read something that makes me go &#34;Huh!&#34;  The writing flows and its a quick read. The author shared some interesting facts and information that has been helpful. I recommend anyone seeking change read this book.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I like it.  They keep their style and add a bit of modernization.  Plus this album cost 7 or 8 bucks less than on iTunes!
B008COPZ60|4.0|The CD was good but the DVD only has the clips of back stage footage of his concert. It would be nice to have the actual concert DVD for those fans who can't go to the concert.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun game, really great graphics! We had the original Temple Run and really liked that but were ready for something new and this has done the job!
B0093ST02E|2.0|Slow, uninteresting and typical storyline of unfaithfulness without a reason. Don't bother.  Waste of your time. Waste of fine cast though.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have been getting used to my new kindle. A good book to read to start my new adventure .
B007VWEEQQ|5.0|It's a good product, but didn't match up with my iPod/hone and I didn't quite get that when I bought it. It seemed like all of the feed backs were saying that it connected to iPhone. Anyway, the seller was really nice and I returned the item. Thank you!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Really captured my heart! I truly believe that I will again meet my beloved dog!  All dog lovers should read this book.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I gave it four stars because I like the actors and the action. I enjoy the writing and twists that tame place.<br />It is an entertaining show.
B000M9BPEY|4.0|First of the visuals in this movie are astounding.  I know many think it's a trivial movie, but I find it a simple tale of a son gettign to really know his father after years of estrangement.  The way in which it's told may seem odd but keeps the viewer engaged and the endign is pretty satisfying.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|It was interesting but stretched reality a little too far.  I did enjoy watching but would only recommend it as an escape movie.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|I ordered this, thinking it was an actual copy of the movie. It was a rental... which is fine! But the outer jacket was just reprinted on a piece of paper. Returned.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|I have i7 on other PC and I know this A8-5600K can't compete in many ways, but for only 1/3 of i7s price, it's well worth it.<br />I wish I should of bought A10 for $20 more but I feel pretty good after built the whole PC with this A8 processor for just little over the price of i7 processor alone.<br />This was used for my media PC in my living room and works perfect.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great because it tells you how many hours you should expect to get out of your device depending on what you plan to do: streaming music, watching video, internet browsing/using WiFi, standby. It also tells you how much time it's going to take your device  to charge. Sometimes this aspect is off about 15 minutes on my kindle fire hd, but that's not anything to cry about.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|We decided to buy this movie before even seeing it in the big screen and it was worth it! Great movie!
B009E9R2OK|1.0|It's a blue ray but its only audio I wanted the video concert. Who would ever make a blue ray just audio...?
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|My  5 year old son watched this movie for the first time and he fell in love with it! We had to add it to our list of favorites.
B0080MPUUK|5.0|great one, especially when he was getting ready for his date, classic allen when he mattered and didn't take himself too seriously.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|An amazing story of valor and chivalery  between a German fighter pilot and the crew of an American<br />B-17 bomber during World War II.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Our grandson loves this version of angry birds and plays it every time he comes to visit with us. Great app.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I like the fact I can search the web; wherever there id wi-fi and not take my laptop. Thank you Kindel! It is easier for me to just carry it in my purse.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing: a perfect mixture of the very serious, nostalgic, and just plain fun tracks. If you don't own \\"The Heist\\", you're missing out.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have several pdf versions of textbooks and being able to jump around is essential when reading a textbook. this app can recognize chapters and chapter sections thus allowing you to move freely around the textbook. Neither Adobe reader or converted pdf/kindle will do this. I highly recommend this app.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I heard about the movie &#34;Argo&#34; while reading an online article that said the country of Iran plans on suing Hollywood for misrepresenting their country in movies.  &#34;Argo&#34; was specifically listed even though it won several Academy Awards.  In the movie, Ben Affleck and George Clooney show their audience how the CIA devised a covert operation to retrieve 6 diplomats who were able to escape during an Iranian raid on the U.S. Embassy.  The head of the operate was privately recognized within the CIA for his intelligence and commitment to serving the United States without harming diplomatic relations.  Thirty years later, this movie publicly pays tribute to the same individual while instilling confidence in the U.S. government.
B00992CF6W|5.0|We love the full version but when we're on the go this pocket version is fabulous!  It's the number one used app on my Kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome but I got the lite<br />its cool my name is Candace<br />if I had it well I do but I would save anything
B0095P3ULC|3.0|I enjoyed the story but the adult language was a distraction. Don't they know that this is supposed to be a kids movie?
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|I'd give it a standing ovation. Perfect pitch, great timing. What a surprize Susan Boyle is. Thanks so very much.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Love the case.  Like the strap how it keeps the case secure and doesn't open up on my bag.  And love how I can angle the screen any ways I like
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Throughout the book I had hopes for an ending different from that which I knew.  Lincoln as a brilliant politiciam, in the best sense of the word, is described in the most readable of language.  A self-educated frontiersman in the midst of the country's most sophisticated and classically educated leaders managed to wring from them all the very best they had to offer when the country needed it the most.  One can not help but wonder if ever there will be another master of manipulation, another so charismatic and yet so humble.  Would that we could find him.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|Cute show.  Sheldon is hilarious.  I don't normally watch network tv, but this show is actually pretty entertaining.  Good cast.
B008478VE8|5.0|It's amazing how a Charles Darwin got this right. Pure observation and analysis. A lot of times he doesnt understand what mechanisims make things happen but is right in pointing out how they happen.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Film runs with a good pace and really does a good job at building suspense even though you know what happens.  Affleck actually acts in this one, rather than playing &#34;Ben Affleck in Argo&#34;.  Supporting cast are excellent!  Rent it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is the best series I have ever watched.  After getting hooked by watching Season 1, I found it hard to wait for Season 2 to begin.  I like the fact they pushed ahead a few years rather than getting stuck in the same time period as Season 1.  They introduced more electric items, the telephone and fancy cars.  This is a fun program to watch.  They deserve any and all awards for this program.  I recommend it highly.
B0094K1QR8|3.0|It is a typical movie plot that is completely predictable.  I love Natalie Portman, but this is not one she is going to win an Oscar for.  I could tell from the previews going in that the movie would be sub-par, but I love Natalie Portman.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|If you listen to a lot of homebrew type songs or covers on Youtube that you can't download otherwise, or like to watch it on the go, this app is awesome. It gives you all sorts of options for different download sizes. It's free and does the job. Doesn't create a playlist properly however. I hope he fixed it.
B000002KIE|5.0|This cd rocks! Sex Pistols are truely timeless. Everyone , whether a punk fan or not, should own this cd
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Had my wife & I engaged throughout the entire season. Clever storylines, and great character /actor selection for this show.
044655667X|5.0|Mickey Haller is one of my favorite characters. Book was a great value. Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors. I have started reading the books in order and the characters make more sense. I will purchase more books from Amazon.com
B006LSZECO|5.0|Most enjoyable. WOULD RECOMMEND and then keep still.  Just not give anything away. What a surprising. Ending. Gone girl is good
B003FBMS4W|4.0|I watched this again, after many years, after reading a review that mentioned the sub-plot as perhaps the main plot of the film.  Main Plot:  young girl kidnapped by Indian tribe during a range war in Texas some time after the Civil War.  Older relative (john Wayne) returns from the Civil War probably aiming to re-establish himself but gets involved after the young girl is kidnapped.  Vows to rescue her from the Indians, but is concerned, That introduces the Sub Plot.  Younger man, brought up by girls family, wants to help and joins Wayne group (all properly deputized) but expresses concern about Wayne's approach to the search. He postpones his betrothal to aid in the search. After some time searching the young man returns to find his intended almost set to marry a rival.  He-reestablishes his intention toward the woman but knows he must leave again to search for the young girl and to keep an eye on Wayne.  Many years pass and finally, after much blood is spilled,  they catchup to the Indian Tribe and finally catchup with the girl,  now a young woman,  who seems happy with her Indian identity.  The girl is finally re-united with her family and seems willing and the young man re-unites with his girl.  The subplot clearly has to do with the old versus the new,  the impossibility of really knowing what will happen in the future,  and the sure knowledge that the old ways must change.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Loved this movie.  Language a little rougher than I like.  It was a great family movie except for language.  Clint is such a great actor
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun to play and easy. Have a hard time stop playing it. Love matching up the jewels. Love passing the time playing Jewels Star.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|like the engineer wish that he had played a larger role in the movie. disliked the ending where the alien creature burst out of the engineer reminds me of alien the movie...overall i give it 3 stars
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It's got great music and replay value!<br />I hope they make a part 2.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a must have for people that love Adele!!!! Will look for more of her newer CDs in the future
B00578FKVE|5.0|What i like about it is the plot, keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br />Has pretty good special effects<br />Must watch by any terminator fan.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|Was not as impressed with the songs, but was okay. Wish I had purchased a CD with newer songs on it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great reinvention of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson in modern day.  This is our favorite show and we will be watching this season again!
0312330537|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years. Yes, the plot has many flaws and the prose can get embarrassingly thick, but the world Gregory Roberts paints with such vivid strokes pulls the reader into an amazing tale full of endearing characters in the rich backdrop of Mumbai, a city the author unfolds to the reader with such love and detail you have to fight the urge to buy a plane ticket by the end. I found any reason I could to return to this thick volume and even after nearly a thousand pages I still wanted more. How often can you say THAT about a novel of such length???
0062082353|5.0|Such a moving story!!  I have enjoyed the book so much!  Great reading!  Recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|loved this movie in the theater. Had to have it on Blu-ray. Great picture with an extra disc of extras. And a digital download for my computer & iPad. Really good movie.
B00BNPUA5Q|2.0|When attempting to install plugins, widgets and whatnot, you get a message that its been maliciously changed. Obviously, an amazon app store change. So now I'm going to have to buy it twice. Not cool!
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I like Britney and have most of her albums. Didn't have this one and was at a great price to add it to my library. Only has two good songs, others are so so.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love the plot, gives credibility to zombie movies. all zombies were injured during the filming of this show. i'd be getting some of those tanks and machine guns and go a hunting.
B006H5120E|5.0|This is one of about twenty I can watch over and over. With a digital download the price can't be beat. A must have for everyones library.
B0031Q0XCA|3.0|This was my first time buying a movie online for a couple of hours.  I have to say that the idea was nice, but I would not do it again because sometimes it would freeze and the quality would shift at random points.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|My daughter (three years old) is in love with this movie. I think its because it's different than all of the other princess movies she watches. The music is very different, they aren't talking about castles, chateaux or wicked stepmothers. It makes for a nice change.
B0067R0APK|1.0|Not recommended because of the fact that it can't be closed without force closing from within the Kindle system settings.
B0095P29EG|3.0|Better than expected. Not a lot of action. My kid screamed through most of it but didn't raise my eyebrow enough to sit through again.
0375842209|5.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" by Markus Zusak showed the world an original and alternate view on World War II.  Told from the perspective of Death, that detail in itself proved how unique the novel would be, the story follows young Liesel, a German girl living with her foster parents in Germany both before the war and right in the middle of it.  Liesel learns to read soon after she arrives at her foster home and begins to adore books; she'll do almost anything to get her hands on one.  Every page in \\"The Book Thief\\" left me thinking about this time period in a whole new way by seeing the different characters actually live through this major historical event. I grew to love each and every character and had to keep myself from breaking down in tears on multiple occasions.  It is clear that Zusak is an extremely talented writer and I hope to read more from him one of these days.  All in all, \\"The Book Thief\\" will leave the reader speechless with all the amazing details it consists as well as an entirely new outlook on World War II.
0446581356|5.0|Very very very informative! Great for beginners, intermediate and pros! Something for everyone in this book! Easy to read and lots of descriptive pictures!
B00942X8PY|4.0|Very nice app.  The simple visual style is sharp, understated, and pleasing to the eye.<br />Level names tie in with the layout of each level and they're often humorous.<br />Zen mode is nice when I don't want to play beat-the-clock. Puzzle mode gives tongue-in-cheek ratings of your performance on that level. I like the attitude.<br />Time will tell if it has replay value. Definitely worth $0.99.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so epic yo being able to join games with other people but X box version is way better but it's better than nothing also other than that it's awesome
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My 3 and a half year old plays this every chance we give her. 1 and a half year old tries too!
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|Love this app, easy setup, audio/listen &amp; talk functions stalk function only available on paid version) separate for quick access, Not a fancy look to camera controls, but camera view, access and operation couldn't be easier thanks to this app. Works great on my Thunderbolt. Well worth the $3.99 price.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Can't beat Adobe for their software. I've owned many of their programs and they have all been great. This one is free.
B004N6369Y|4.0|This book is very enjoyable.  The family dynamic made you feel a real connection with the characters.  The resolution  was very satisfying.
B005LN5UOC|5.0|IT IS COMFORTABLE TO WEAR FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME WHEN PLAYING ONLINE.<br />THE SOUND IS EXCELLENT!<br />LOOKS JUST AS GOOD AS IT PERFORMS!<br />I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />BUY IT!
0688014291|4.0|A very good management process, but one that takes a lot of time and effort to put into effect. Once you have achieved the results it is well worth the effort though. Anyone looking for insight into different managing styles should read this.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I received this case for my Kindle Fire, and it is a very pretty color, but I like purple. So far, I am very happy with this purchase.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|I underestimated Downey's skills and truly enjoyed him in this movie.  Really good adaptation of another Marvel superhero.  I am looking forward to Iron Man 3.
1582701709|5.0|I found the book to be very interesting, uplifting and an easy read. It was hard to put the book down!
B0043JDUNS|5.0|After the first Iron Man, I became a fan of Downey.  I also like that Don Cheadel joined the gang and maintained the temperament of Rhodie (played by Terrence Howard in the first).  Good amount of action and humor.  Looking forward to #3!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The special effects enhancements that were done for this Blu-Ray version are incredible! The option to view in the original form or in the enhanced mode is Awesome! It's great! I love it! It's a must for every original series Star Trek fan! They put some serious thought into this project! ...Bravo! Now let's do the same with the old Star Wars episodes!
B004IXFGZO|5.0|What can you say about YANNI, Great song list and quality and I like the Amazon way to DL and receive quickly
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This has been one of my favorite games. It wasn't to short, the graphics where good, and the storyline rocked. Congratulations Big fish, on another great game.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game, definitely recommend this game to anyone who plays Temple Run,  only thing I dont like is that you can not change the runner like in the other Temple Runs.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Sweet potato salad with the effects on my home page that I have been in a very good for the color that I have been in the shipping for you can name of the effects are not able to send what it says in the shipping for a page that would like to cancel reply case until I have been in the dark knight rider to the first words are going through the shipping and handling the shipping for a very long time and handling it is not suitable for the unit
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was recommended to me by someone who grew up in foster care.  The story may have given me a new understanding<br />of the importance of real love in a child's life.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I believe we have seen this movie about five times in the last three days.  The kids don't want to stop watching it.<br /><br />It is definitely an interesting spin on some of our well know fairy tale characters, The Easter Bunny, Sandman, Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, and Jack Frost.<br /><br />Well worth the rent but I would recommend buying as I think you'll get some mileage out of this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i like this app! i am house crazy so this gives me one too care for that fits in my pocket.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Unlike other weather apps I've tried, this one seems accurate 95% of the time within a few degrees. Better than the rest.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters seem real for their time and circumstances. I felt like I was there, and a part of the action. It is so much better than Upstairs/Downstairs which I could never get into. I could not wait for the next episode to start.
B00BESNKB8|2.0|Not very good, a bit silly take off on the old chinese Kung Fu movies. It need more fight scenes. How does a black guy/African manage to be a blacksmith in ancient China??
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Much of it was okay, but it became dull after awhile. Certainly there could have been more happiness depicted. I hated the ending!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You can't stop with season two.  Disappointing to see the ending on season three though.  What will season four hold in store?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I haven't played too much, but I hope to be able to choose bright colored horses  this is a fun app.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series was very engaging and fun to watch.  Interesting to see the characters develop over time and the many subplots.
0802473156|5.0|This book is a must read for all humanity :) finally i understand the reason for what i had been asking in my previous relationships plus makes me a better person!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|My husband and I have been working with teens for 30 years and have occasionally run into a young person that has caused us to have renewed faith in the younger generation.  The young characters in The Fault of our Stars will have that effect as well as making you think very differently about the plight of the terminally ill.<br /><br />I appreciated (as a parent) that this wasn't another story of teenage angst pitting teens against their parents or other adults.  It's refreshing to find a story about families loving each other even if it's clumsy and imperfect.  After starting the book, I was afraid that the style and tone was more geared towards young readers, but I hung in there and was happy<br />to find mature thinking a couple of interesting plot twists that held my interest.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book tells not only of the extraordinary skills of one man, but the real life background of what he, and his family, went through on a personal level. May God rest his soul, Chris Kyle gave an astounding answer as to why men punish themselves to become special ops soldiers. Read the book, cause I'm not going to tell you. Someone once said, after a horrific, historic battle, Where do we (America) find such men as these&#34;? This book will give the answer. I highly recommend this book. I only hope this country can honor these unsung heroes in the manner they deserve.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|I found several of the characters rather unbelievable.  I also didn't feel that the parents would ever have been attracted to each other.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I always slept with a fan running but we are going on a trip soon and I needed to find something that would work for that. since I started using this app...I have slept better than I have in years. I love it.
B001EC2IV2|5.0|Great Movie very entertaining lots of action, I really enjoyed watching it. Arnold Schwarzeneggar played his roll real well.. It has a happy ending..
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Good action flick that keeps the viewer interested.  It has exotic places where the heros foil the bad guys and keep the world safe.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|The 3rd season of Fringe was very good in comparison to other shows out there but it was not as good as the first two seasons of the show itself.
B008Q0CO0U|5.0|Stephen Hunter did a great joib on this &#34;Bob the Nailer&#34; book. It brought the original version from the Vietnam era to current day. Enough realisim to keep things in check with a good action packed plot.
B004I744AS|4.0|Really helpful for a mom of six that needs to catch up with her growing children. I like the games that will test your word skills.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I loved the story but did not realize that it was a short story. I was very disappointed when the story was over. It only took about an hour to read. I would give the story a higher star rating but was too frustrated by the lenght.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|The movie was very good until the end when they stated the crisis was resolved peacefully.  The hostages were not release until President Reagan took office because Iran knew he was not a pacifist.  He carried a big stick and was not afraid to use it.  The comments at the end are wrong and misleading.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|Paul Newman and Robert Redford are at their best in this movie. The acting is superb along with great sound and film quality.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I have several types of singing bowls and everyone loves the sound to herald the start and finish of meditations. It's nice to be able to use this app and free myself from playing the bowls or being concerned about timing for group meditations. I appreciate the variety and differnt tones of the bowls on this app.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|If you run, you need to read Born to Run. If you don't run, it's probably not a bad idea to read it anyway.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Where was this guy in 1971? Sounds like a ccross between Donovan and Jose Feliciano. Can't compare him to Dylan because you can understand every word he says.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has always been portrayed as a rather dour logical character and in most films this is what we see. Only a few have ever given him a sense of humor that wasn't a parody but this portrayal is completely off the wall. Even so, there is still the drive, the ruthless logic that one sees as he calculates his moves to best effect. He may appear crazy, but one can see that he is anything but as he goes about his hunt of enemies that are- almost- his equal. In this, he seeks to apprehend a man already considered dead,yet risen from the grave,murdering the members of a secret club--and yet, this is not the most nefarious of his plans, plans that would put the Entire British Empire in jeopardy. Robert Downy JR. And Jude Law are quirky, and sometimes funny, but this dosen't distract from a wild time as they seek to put Rockwood back into his grave, to stay, this time and save Parliment.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|omg.this is the best game for all ages so fun u never want to put it down no violence so fun I don't know what the bad.reveiws r about this game is amazing and free must buy
B005K15XR4|5.0|This is great, for listening, for travel, dragon fighting, arguing with eldritch creatures or designing great fantastical trips for the mind. I love good soundtrack music, original scores are my favorites as they are specifically tailored for the movie rather than outside music just thrown in. Not only does it enhance a picture, it also allows one's mind to work and imagine other scenarios where it might fit. Killing a bear? Got just the theme for that!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app!! It's so realistic!!!:) I wish more apps were like this. This is so epic! Love it!
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|While this may have taken a few liberties with history, this was still excellently done as Cate reprises her role as Queen Elizabeth as she settles into her duties at court. There are still intrigues--and a war with Spain in the offing, and a bittersweet affair with Sir Walter Raleigh, a handsome rogue who fell in love with a different Bess, all while romancing the Queen and seeking favor. The largest intrigue is with her prisoner, Mary Queen of Scots and her upcoming execution. King Phillip of Spain uses this execution as an excuse to launch an all out war with England and there is many an anxious moment as the Queen knows the Armada is coming, and can do little to stop it on her own. Her words of prophecy to the snide Ambassadors from Spain however, do come true as both fire and storm contrive to humble Phillip as he is left bankrupt when the Armada fails to deliver the sure victory he thought he had. This was indeed a glorious second half to the story of Good Queen Bess, and well done, I felt.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Baby boomers will like it for lettign them relive a period in their youth. Everyone - young and old - wil enjoy the great story, suspense, and moderate action.  Try seeing it on a home theater or movie theater with a good sound system.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle is quite a young man, he is, no doubt, intelligent and highly motovated. He is the kind that just does not give up. Just what the special ops folks are looking for. I enjoyed the book especially his candid insights into his life both in and out of the military.<br />His death is most disturbing and a great loss not just his family but also the country.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|For a fascinating, moving, feel-good true story, with great music, scenery, and lots of relevance to current issues in the U.S., like unemployment, troubles in the rust belt...
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I am not good with alarms.  I always somehow manage to turn it off and go back to sleep.  Not anymore.  Solving math problems is a great way to get going in the morning.  My girlfriend probably hates it tho when I stumble upon division at 5 am.
0446572764|4.0|Spoiler Alert. I read this on a Kindle. This story started slow. I was at the point of giving up, when at 33% complete it picked up. I was very impressed up until the point when the motive of the killer was stated. Really? I can see that he did the killings because of what happened when he was a kid. I thought it was silly that he only did it to get his brother's attention. Russia is a huge country. The idea that if he killed enough children it would get his brother's attention was a hurdle that I can not jump over. I liked the ending. I will probably read another in the series just to see how he continues the story.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I love this game and have wasted away countless hours playing it.  I got it for free from amazon app of the day but would recommened it for anyone.  worth the money
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app for weather, but it still has &quot;refresh&quot; issues.  The refresh button refreshes the time of day, but doesn't refresh the weather!  I press &quot;refresh&quot; and it still displays yesterday's weather, though the time and date are updated.  This is especially frustrating when I want to see the 36 hour or the 10 day forecasts.  For what it's worth, I haven't had the battery drainage issue that others have reported.  I am running it on a Kindle Fire.
B007JMW46U|4.0|This is a great collection short stories about Sherlock Holmes. There are a wide variety of methods by which he solves the mysteries put before him. These are my first experiences with Holmes. I intend to read more
B0045XICB2|4.0|I don't know if it is my internet that is slow sometimes. It is pretty good. But once and awhile it pauses it's self.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|It was entertaining and fun.  The plots were challenging as well. Holmes and Watson made it &#34;happen&#34;. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a &#34;good yarn&#34;.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|not off planet. No mutants but one. The women had great fight scenes. very believable, unlike Batman Rises. the end
B009O2XY12|2.0|While I do enjoy this game, it can only be played while connected to the internet!  Since I prefer to play games 'offline' to extend battery use this is a HUGE 'Con' for me.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Sad what happened to Sugar Man but interesting documentary. A little slow at times but worth the watch. Loved the music. Would recommend it to others.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. Looks like it is simple but not so much. Sometimes you just have to let your mind flow with the game. Best free game out there.
B009EAO38C|5.0|My daughter sent me a link to their music. I had not heard any of it before. Love the variety of songs. Would recommend!
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Surprisingly good performances from these young actors and actresses.  Very good storyline with excellent effects.  (spoiler: The unique thing about this flick was that Spielberg managed to make a monster movie that focused more on the characters than the blood and gore.  It was a nice surprise.)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Funny and endearing.  Real life IS weird and quirkey.  This book is real. Im looking for something else from Matthew Quick.
B0037TRVHQ|3.0|The content was very well recorded and quite pleasant, not enough variety for my taste. I would give it 4 stars if my copy had not skipped in two SACD players. Returned it.
B00BGZ8TVA|3.0|Wonderful effects and a touching movie but it seriously fails the book.  Yann Martel wove a wonderful story about Pi, the movie doesn't touch half the content and for good reason I suppose; the book is very graphic and a literal adaptation of it would make a better horror movie than a heart-warming, family-friendly one.  Still, it is entertaining.. I just wish I hadn't bothered.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|it keeps my brain working as well as my eye-hand coordination, this ancient game would be so difficult to play were it not for being able to play it on computer or kindle..
B009AHWLHE|5.0|The Last Resident Evil Cartoon Degeneration was good this one however is great one of the best in this series. If you loved the movies like I do then you'll love this nextt phased of the seires. Lois Banks
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I've had the free version of piano master for some time. But couldn't play all the songs until I purchased the full version. I lilke to play keyboard and accordion, and this really helps me to expand my abilities. THANK YOU
B006LSZECO|4.0|Had never read anything by this author and was pleasantly surprised. Liked it very much and would definitely recommend this.
B000YABS8E|5.0|I ordered this DVD to watch on a lengthy plane ride.  It was as terrific as I remembered.  Brendan Fraser was delightful!
1616550414|5.0|I was interested in this book because I was under the assumption that it was going to be a book of art and production notes. I had no idea that not only was it that, but it was also a detailed story, weaving together the stories of all the games. From Skyward Sword to Minish Cap, this book gives you the low down on your favorite hero! Over all, an excellent, if not overwhelming guide to all things Hyrule!
B008966SLM|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. The songs are what I call &#34;feel good music&#34;.  I just feel good when I listen to them. Robert Cray and the band have out done themselves for sure on this one.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I didn't know if i would like this series. I do like science fiction. I REALLY enjoyed this series! I'm on the 3rd season already.
B008220C38|4.0|It was a good representation of the story. Was it absolutely brilliant no, but it was not a waste of time watching it. I feel they did things with style and imagination so it deserves some credit.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The story is poorly written, the action and thoughts behind the movie seems to be if you put in enough special effects people will like it.  Not a great children's or adult movie.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works well ...this is a well thought out app. It the one you will be using all the time. Soon you will be recommending to all those close friends.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|this is the worst company ever! the free version is better then the money version! there are more sounds on the free! premium is not the word. HORRIBLE sounds alot better.....................DONT GET IT! i want my money back!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book. Was hooked the whole time! Can't wait till the second movie comes out, it will be AWESOME!!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Once you start reading and get involved in the book you cant put it down... A great read even for adults!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was really cool when I started off and now I can go to many different places try it out!!!!!!
B006ID01OS|5.0|For anyone in a strategic position in a firm, this book is a great aid to show examples of successes and failures that can help in your business journey. The author is clearly knowledgeable of the stories and topics she writes.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I absolutely love Vince Flynn & this one was no exception.  I want more please!  Hope he is well and able to write more Rapp books.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Very interesting and well-written from front to back. History is always vulnerable to biases and this book seems to have the right one.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of our all-time favorite movies with great lessons. Some rough language and a couple of very rough prison scenes that you'll want to skip if you have teens.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This may be blasphemous, but I liked it better as a movie... I don't think I have ever felt that way before, but there is a first time for everything.<br /><br />I think the main character is more likeable in the movie. Perhaps the reason I had such a hard time with this is because I have little brothers this age.<br /><br />Regardless, it's an good book, but now having seen the movie, I think I prefer it over the book.
B008220DGE|3.0|At times fascinating but overlong and enigmatic, \\"The Master\\" follows a drifting war veteran who becomes involved with a family cult organization. Joaquin Phoenix gives a mesmerizing performance as the tormented Freddie Quell, whose fondness for hard liquor (his specialty is a drink concocted from paint thinner) and sex pretty much rule his life. When he meets Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the \\"master\\" of \\"The Cause\\", he succumbs to the charismatic leader who attempts to tame Freddie's animal nature. Perhaps in the end, the entire film is about the notion that one cannot change their true nature, although that assessment may seem too simplistic. The film, however, is frustrating in that it fails to fully explain just what Dodd's group is trying to accomplish or what their philosophy is.<br /><br />The film does have a mesmerizing quality which is achieved by the terrific acting (although some may find that the actors are trying too hard). Hoffman is very effective as Dodd and one of the best scenes in the film is a powerful session between him and Phoenix as they go through a \\"processing\\" interview. Phoenix hunches his shoulders, scrunches his face and walks around with his hands on his hips in a physical transformation that is sometimes unintentionally humorous (a friend says he reminded him of Martin Short's character, Ed Grimley) but he matches Hoffman's intensity and their relationship in the film is believable.<br /><br />In the end, this is probably a film that deserves more than one viewing to grasp some of its meanings. It is one that will leave you with more questions than answers.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You just can't beat Josh in a romance.  I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD or itunes.
0525953728|5.0|This is a VERY well written book. It gives the common citizen insight to the dedication and hard work that goes into being in the military at this level. I don't know how others who are in the military will feel reading this book, but I enjoyed it very much. It gave me a glimpse into a world that I know little about while also taking me along for the ride on a VERY important mission. Thank you for writing this book!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Would definitely recommend. Love the writing style. Such a sweet story. You really he  into the story and before you know  it, you're sad it's over!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Very enjoyable, worth it! Nice family movie and the streaming was shudder free. Good video quality and sound. Kids will like it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this story by Andy Weir.  Even though this story is technically Science Fictioni, I found the characters to be very realistic, and the story to be believable!  Not a story for children as there is some language and nudity (hee hee).
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Full of action as usual, sorry to see Judy Dench go out like that, I thought she was going to get with the old guy and retire. I hope the new &#34;M&#34; can hack it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I have been rivited to this series. We love the ups and downs of the characters. There are some you love to hate, like Mrs. Obrien.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|As a long time fan of Jeffrey Archer I was a little disappointed in Best Kept Secret.  I think it is a long way from his best work.  It did not flow in the way his stories normally do and I did not find the notputdownable factor that I normally find in his books.  Two thoughts came to mind, number one is he tiring of the characters and finding the series a bit of a chore or is he using a ghost writer and just feeding them his ideas.  I hope the latter is not true as I like to feel I am reading the real work of Jeffrey Archer and I hope he lifts the standard for the next book.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|After already having a cover for her Kindle Fire I decided to buy this colorful cover for Valentines Day. She uses it every day and really likes the color.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a quick game and enjoyable one.  Has different levels and moves quickly.  Different puzzles to figure out and keeps you interested.
B007UK83S4|4.0|Townshend recalls vividly the turbulent and memory challenged years of his involvement in The Who rock band. His memory seems sharp and sensitive as he describes his personal struggles of childhood, his emerging band involvements in his teenage years and the cliched 'life' of an embryonic then fully committed rock star lifestyle. He is open and balanced about his own emotional immaturity and relationship inconsistencies. His intellectual struggles (and pretensions) widen the reader's understanding of his musical endeavours. Oddly, full knowledge of the musical releases by The Who, or solo work by Townshend, is not required to gain understanding and pleasure from the book (although such awareness will greatly enhance the experience.)<br />Best suited to the older adult reader who experienced the 'forgotten' years of sex, drugs, and rock and roll!
B0040I09RM|5.0|My husband and I were told by our 27 year old son that there was a new show not on the regular channels (ABC, CBS, NBC) and that we needed to venture out from those channels we watch so often.<br /><br />We watched the first episode and are now fans of the show.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Dr Who is a british sci-fi TV series.  If you were a fan of 10th Doctor David Tennant, 11th Doctor Mat Smith does not dissapoint either.  Amy Rory and the Doctor are off to new adventrues and it's spectacular.  Very emotional, suspensful, and lots of new intrigueing advneturs.  It's absolutely marvelous.  Love it!
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is truly inspiring and Dr Campbell's research is extremely informative. I was inspired to go beyond vegetarianism to veganism and change my life for the better. I hope more people take the lessons from this book seriously and apply them to their own lives.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|The movie is an adaptation of Ayn Rand's book by the same name.  If you liked/loved the book, this movie does not dissapoint.  I'm a huge Ayn Rand's philosophy fan and I loved this movie.  Follows pretty close to the book and it's beautiful.  Recommend for sure.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I don't usually read Nicholas Sparks books because they usually end up being a movie.  I sampled this and it seemed like a good book, never heard anything about it.  I really enjoyed the book, one thing at the end surprised me a bit.  Of course I'm just about done with the book and I see it being advertised for upcoming movie.  I'm like damn, its a movie.  I am glad I read it and will wait for the movie to come out in video.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|While some may be disappointed, I felt that the final book provided the closure that others have said it lacked. Reading the evolution of Katniss, Peeta and Gale, although dark, humanizes them, and allows the reader to associate their own struggles and wars in a way that can only be done by masterful storytelling. Well done in every way.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I was a little apprehensive in buying a book from this unknown author because I thought it might be an amateur attempt at self glorification. What a great surprise to find I couldn't put the book down once I started reading! The author has done a great job in creating a spell-binding non-fiction account of what life is like &#34;in the field&#34; and in many ways the truth is more compelling than fiction. There is no self-glorification or amateur writing. I recommend this book as excellent reading without reservation and would gladly buy any other books by this author.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book reads like it was written by a barely literate teenager.  If you take it seriously, it is awful.  If you view it as a comedy, it is quite entertaining!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The acting was fantastic, the story line was unique, and the depiction of the historical event was accurate and tasteful.  Highly recommend this film.
B007NCTWX4|5.0|I discovered this album from a song playing on a television show~~I just love the whole album !! I have not seen the video yet.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Once again, Pinar pulls off a movie that appeals to children yet offering a deep enough story to satisfy adults
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I found the book very entertaining in its ironic approach to so much of last century politicians. The characters come alive and are very well depicted. I couldn't stop myself: was laughing out loud.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Its a very high intensity book that most people that liked Hunger Games would like. Hope you enjoy the book.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I personally think that season 2 is the best! I love the episodes on the farm, the new characters are great! Every episode keeps you wanting more!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Its a very high intensity book that most people that liked Hunger Games would like. Hope you enjoy the book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My hubby and I are addicted to this show! Season 3 has so many ups and downs, it kept me on my seat every episode. I love how the writers always end it in a way that makes you want to watch more, but it is also frustrating. I hope there is a 4th season!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Its a very high intensity book that most people that liked Hunger Games would like. Hope you enjoy the book.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I was raised on Star Trek and my mom even named me after the Lt (the bald one). The spelling of our names are different, but the pronunciation is the same. I love all things Star Trek-and Star Trek TNG-so getting this was a no brainer and I was happy to get it when the price went down. LOVE IT!!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Its a very high intensity book that most people that liked Hunger Games would like. Hope you enjoy the book.
B004CCNB58|5.0|DVD arrived and enjoyed seeing the changes made from the original (which I have on VHS). Look forward to the next installment.
034580404X|5.0|Thank you for the fast and prompt service. I loved the item. I will recommend you to others. Received my item in a fast timely manner. AWSOME BOOKS great price, can't wait for E.L James next series.
B005EI86JU|3.0|I guess there is just to much to learn in a rather brief book.  I was expecting more from this book.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I love the setting and costuming.  The story, I think, is fairly accurate.  One could question the immodesty of some of the characters but after all, this is not a documentary.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I had only seen a variety of episodes of modern family when I decided to my season 1. So glad I did. Will be buying other seasons soon.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very enjoyable and fun. I love the graphics it makes temple run 2 look bad. Must try game.... so glad I got this..... it's free to!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this series.  Once I started it, I couldn't wait to watch the next episode all the way through the last season.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I loved this novel it was beautifully descriptive and transported me to an amazing place, I couldn't put it down. The metaphor throughout the book comparing his story to religion is beautiful and thought provoking. The book made me laugh and cry and I highly recommend it.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|lots of puzzles! customized settings! several varieties! what more can you ask for? i use this on my kindle fire and it works perfectly every time!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like. Would like more variety of puzzle subjects and more puzzles. A higher level of difficult.<br />Keep them coming.

B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book in one evening...I could not put it down!! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I really like World of Goo. The levels are just challenging enough to keep you interested. Sometimes they are a little too challenging, but that's the point of playing; you want to keep at it until it's done!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Coming from an adult perspective (30-45), I give it 4 stars due to the level of  sensitivity on controls. Took awhile to  adjust to controls and I think they could fine tune that better for the kindle. However, I enjoy the game and have a hard time it putting it it down
B000ICXQU6|5.0|Outstanding performance by Julia Roberts.  Movie was well written, well directed, well produced.  It's a MUST SEE.  Very empowering, very motivating, and very eye-opening.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|My son has recently fallen in live with Star Wars Legos. This was a great addition to his collection. The tiny figures are awesome.<br />He is only 4 and plays rough so the pod does occasionally come apart. No big deal, we just put it back together.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Like the features, hate the colors but a must have for Kindle HD users who eat, sleep and breath with their HD's...

B009WO7NQO|4.0|I should have seen the (Kindle Tablet Edition) for what it was. I have a smart phone but had to repurchase this due to the KTE. If possible, no NOT purchase an app with (KTE). It will not run on your other devices...
0062014536|3.0|The hype and anticipation around this book is pretty amazing. Lauren Oliver has scores of devoted fans scrambling to read this. I feel pretty lucky that I got to meet Lauren last week and hear her talk about her experience writing the whole series before diving in. I'll preface by saying that I've always been kind of just warm about this series. I started reading it because it was recommended for fans of The Hunger Games and Divergent, two of my all-time favorites. I liked Delirium, but didn't love it. I enjoyed Pandemonium more, liked the novellas a lot, and was pretty excited going into Requiem. I have always felt this concept is brilliant - that love is a disease and creates all kinds of chaos in our society - but I think that missing link for me has been a lack of connection with the characters. Oliver is a wonderful writer, and I'm glad I've taken this journey with her, but I don't feel like the series will be sticking with me long term.<br /><br />Requiem was the weakest of the three books in my opinion. The story is told in alternating voices of Lena and Hana. The Lena chapters suffer from what I'm going to call \\"traipsing through the woods,\\" which happens in a lot of 2nd novels in trilogies, but somehow is in the conclusion here. There's a lot of walking and hiding in the Wilds, a lot of thinking about \\"the plan,\\" and a lot of names to remember, but not a lot of moving the story forward. The most productive thing that happens for the majority of the Lena sections is establishing that her relationship with Alex is damaged. The interactions between the two of them are heart-breaking. I felt horrible for Julian, because it was very clear Lena was settling, and I don't think he quite realized that for most of the book. Other than that, there is very little character development in these chapters. No real growth that I could see.<br /><br />The Hana chapters, though, were excellent. Hana is telling the story of what's going on inside the walls, both generally, and personally. She is preparing for her wedding to her pair, Fred Hargrove, and she discovers that her fiance, also the new mayor, is not what he appears to be. She goes through a lovely evolution, learning to think for herself despite being cured, and also reconciling her guilt over what happened with Lena and Alex when they all parted ways. I was proud of Hana by the end of the story and how loved seeing how she handled herself.<br /><br />As with the others, the writing is beautiful. Oliver knows how to describe, how to create emotion, how to put the reader down in a spot and make them see what she wants them to see. She mentions two stories from the Book of Shh to illustrate a couple of things and their use was really nice, graceful.<br /><br />The ending, which does provide answers to some questions, is very abrupt. I was all \\"that was it?\\" I expected some kind of epilogue, but there was none. The story, which is so political and timely, left me wanting to know so much more about what happens in the city, in the country. It is sort of suggested, but not enough. Oliver is so good with the novellas, so I think some kind of \\"this is what happened later\\" short would be welcomed. She mentioned in her talk that she might think about writing something from Grace's perspective later on - I'd fully support that!<br /><br />I'm torn. This one gets between a 2.5 and 3/5 from me. I liked a lot of things about it, but was ultimately left unsatisfied. 3/5 for the series as a whole.d personally.

B002GAR3AM|3.0|This season was too rushed. Also, the download did not work smoothly; it kept stopping and I would have to start over.
B000063COX|5.0|Today we just learned that Maiden's original drummer Clive Burr died at age 56. One of the main resons that this and Maiden's next two albums were so incredible was because of the skillful percussion of Mr. Burr.<br />I played this CD tonite as a tribute. I suggest all Maiden fans do the same...
B000I0QM0E|5.0|This is one of my very first DVD purchases and favorites of TIm Burton. Its one of his most beautiful films photographed and Art Directed.
B001IWV030|5.0|How could it not be great with this cast? Peter Sellers is delightful, David Niven, Peter Falk, Maggie Smith, Alec Guinness is a magnificent blind butler, Truman Capote a suitably eccentric host and James Coco...<br /><br />This genre cannot be done anymore because there are no replacements for these inimitable characters. This movie you can watch again and again and still enjoy every minute.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is S. Spielbergs best film in my opinion no frame was wasted, only thing is that I wish it had a behind the scenes making of. Yet its a truly epic film that I enjoyed watching again.
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|It is a decent cop show with a antihero who is a bastard with a proverbial heart of gold. Vic Mackie is a bit of caricature of a \\"bad ass\\" which makes each instance of him attempting to be a good guy seem inauthentic.<br /><br />I had initially been turned on to it by Jeff Canata of the Totally Rad Show constantly referring to it as the best TV show of all time. I'm disappointed, since it was no where near as good as it was hyped. For a better cop show with subtlety and nuance check out The Wire.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Great family movie. Maybe not for very young kids. Will be watching again.  There are some beautiful scenes in this movie.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|great movie in fact i watched it twice so far. A must see flick...you felt you were living the experience with Pi....
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was historically informative, artistically entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat most of the time.  Great movie!
B005KELW26|1.0|this cover said it would fit my kindle fire and it DID NOT.  Went to BJ's where i bought the kindle fire and the cover they sold fits great...
B000002H38|5.0|There is absolutely nothing wrong with this record--it's perfection from start to finish, with a little something for everything--soulful, jazz-inflected torch songs (Been So Long), more uptempo fare (Same Ole Love, Watch Your Step). Anita's incredibly rich, soulful voice makes everything work. A seminal work, to be sure.
B00000427L|4.0|The usual disclaimers: I'm not terribly good with music, I'm Chinese (BUT BUT BUT I refuse to judge artists based on ethnicity - that would be idiotic beyond words), I'm actually not this user (that would be my Dad, so level your pitchforks and torches at the following Gmail address: \\"danny.sepley\\" without the quotes if you want to kill me). All that said, the review follows:<br /><br />- Technique is beyond reprimand as far as I know. This is for paranoid Kissin-haters who really didn't like his tempo in the third concerto, and for Argerich-lovers who think everybody else plays too slowly. Ashkenazy has no inhibitions, whether artistic or technical: he offers us an honest and confident account of the four concertos.<br /><br />- Interesting mic'ing. It feels like both the LSO and Ashkenazy were mic'd VERY closely, so at times it may feel like you're listening to the music sitting inside the piano with the orchestra ringed around you as tightly as possible. It's not the same as being mixed \\"loudly,\\" which you can adjust just by turning the volume knob up or down on your speaker system; it's where things sound physically close, which does things with the acoustics ... I may be conservative, but I'm not terribly fond of this type of recording.<br /><br />- Interpretation is good, but at times I don't quite understand what Ashkenazy meant. He breezes through the finer points of technique with ease, but at times he seems to slow down on passages that sound a little unusual at that speed - passages that he could easily speed up on. That's not to say the playing is poor or that the music doesn't appeal - which is not true - but it is to say that it will sound a little affected to those who have grown used to other (possibly more romantic? more spirited? People who harbor excessive love for Horowitz may understand this) playing. Notwithstanding, the overall musical picture is cohesive and well-played.<br /><br />- The LSO is, as always, wonderful under Andre Previn's baton. You could hardly ask for a better orchestra for anything - and to give Rachmaninoff the LSO treatment, oh joy!<br /><br />So why did I deduct a star? These recordings, at times, don't sit well with me. It's _good_, but it's not _great_. I was a little saddened by the execution of the LSO in the third movement of the fourth concerto at its climax: it sounds ALMOST like a mistake, but I'm guessing it was just a rare instance of poor timing or something. What a nit-picker I am. I remember my initial reaction when I first listened to Ashkenazy's playing was that he lacked emotion. This was an erroneous judgment, I know, but that his playing is so oblique that it gives me pause...<br /><br />I stand at odds with some of the five-starrers: if I had to rebuild my collection from scratch, I would not start from these recordings. They would follow - eventually - on the heels of those at the forefront, though. If you're looking to jump-start a Rachmaninoff collecting spree, this album is an excellent starter, compared to scrambling around collecting all the fragmented recordings by different artists with different orchestras everywhere.<br /><br />But...just in case anybody is interested...I highly recommend Michelangeli (with Ettore Gracis conducting the Philharmonia) for the fourth concerto, if you can still get it, and Mikhail Pletnev (with Rostropovich leading the Russian National Orchestra) for the third concerto. I am aware that Horowitz and Argerich seem to be the \\"definitive\\" performers of the third concerto; I stand by Pletnev, nonetheless. The first concerto I am not familiar enough with, and the second one I dare not make recommendations about - I think I'm already risking enough pitchforks and torches here.
B001EBWING|5.0|I rented this movie to view, because of a class assignment. I though it was going to be a boring black and white movie...but I was totally wrong! It's awesome! I was kind of disappointed of how it ended, but every story can't have happy endings!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love these type of games. great graphics!!!!! It's challenging and fun at the same time. A great puzzle which really makes you think.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show. Best season so far. Can't wait for the finale. The show never ceases to amaze in terms of its willingness to kill off key characters.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great season full of surprises and plot twists- sometimes the episodes go off the plot path but very well written and acted episodes and season. Extremely creative writing without getting too silly.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|The characters and the writers make the show.  The chemistry between the actors keep it fresh, with twist and turns better than some roller coaster.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This makes viewing my personal videos so much easier on my Kindle.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie is about Dracula the over protectman father who is attacked by humans so he makes a big cashle to protect his goons.<br /><br />the little girl vampire learns the true meening of love when a human wins her heart in a bloodless revolution, taking place in Britain 200 years ago<br /><br />If you liked shrek, you will like this movie because they are both three demonsions<br /><br />good movei=<br /><br />11/10 its okay<br /><br />P.S how does Frankenstein have a wife if in the novel Victor never goes through with creating her what dumdums
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This is a very interesting rockumentary. Dave Grohl, Trent Reznor, Josh Homme and various other artists and past employees of Sound City put into perspective just how important this studio actually was and still is to many. Dave Grohl commands respect with out meaning to and it makes for sincere and informative commentary. I also would strongly suggest buying the soundtrack.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a very good tool app to have. I use this when I setup new wifi routers to pick the best channel.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best ever made. I don't watch alot of tv but when I do it has to be good. The storyline keep you interested
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was young and I still love this movie. It's great for all ages!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved it! I never thought it would have the turn of events that it did! At first I was not a fan then it blew me away!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Though I think this started a little slowly, it soon picked up and you will not want to put it down.  It is a little graphic when animals kill or are killed, but a good story told well.  The movie followed the book fairly well, too.
1616550414|5.0|I gave it a 5/5 because i love legend of zelda. I love the entire series so the fact Nintendo published what was by far one of the greatest mysteries of gaming, that being a reference to the timeline of the game, was a must read. The only real downside i had was the fact a little over half the book was about SKyward Sword, there latest installment in the series at my time of writing this. It made sense, both being 25th anniversary but i had to beat the game before i could delve into those pages as to not spoil anything for me. Other than that however the book is amazing with the bonus manga in the back, the timeline itself and how each game interacted with one another. If you are a video game book collector, this is a must have. IF your a diehard legend of zelda fan, this is a MUST HAVE, If your just a casual reader, maybe not even if you have heard of the series. Overall i enjoyed it and read it often, especially when i am playing the games, since it shows and clears up alot of mystery of how they connect. 5/5
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I liked the movie but didn't agree with the Oscar hype. If you can't seem to find anything else to rent or watch on TV you may try watching this to fill the void.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|once you start you can't stop.  lots of bonus jewels and levels to keep you from becoming bored. Give it a go.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is a magically interesting story about destiny, dedication and embracing the unknown with an underlying story that alludes to love and the struggle to own commitments. I'd recommend it to anyone
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Fairly good production value and a decent, though often over the top story-line.  The History Channel is really trying to break into the scripted series world and this is a valiant attempt.  I recommend it, even if only for the breathtaking scenery.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Even through its ups and downs, this book is overall a very good story. It's a tale of struggles and the unknown as Alzheimer's complicates the lives of a family.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great book for young and older readers.<br />The characters really  come to life.  Greek mythology in harry potter format.  My 9 year old will enjoy  reading this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This is a good book for young adult readers - going into it, I didn't realize that 30-something women weren't quite the target audience. It's about high school romance. Too much of the script is dedicated to make-out scenes for my liking.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Having lived during the Iranian hostage ordeal, it was interesting to watch it unfold on the screen and get this look at one event during its occurence.  Great cast, well done.  Exciting, intense and fascinating.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven<br /><br />I also saw the movie...loved them both...the movie did not quite follow the book and after seeing the movie I read the book
B005HI4LLY|5.0|For once the rednecks aren't the bad guys! This movie is tongue in cheek redneck humor at its best! I laughed all the way through!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|A great step back into time....I have always had a passion for this movie. I will undoughtedly watch it again.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The book was good - wasn't the best book I've ever read.  I haven't seen the movie yet but the book made me want to see it.
B001A3CP5Y|4.0|They are having a great time. The songs are interesting but, none of them stand out. It's good to hear musicians work with each other on a strong project.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I own alot of Blu Ray concerts and this one is definitely in the TOP 5.<br />  The most suprising to me was Don Henley's solid vocal quality after all these years.<br />  The audio is a 4.5 out of 5 and so is picture quality. The songlist is thorough and should please most eveyone. It's a great value for the money with almost 3 hours of performances. Here's the song list.<br /><br />01. The Long Run<br />02.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|I doubt myself of the outcome and even after reading it I am still not sure what really happened.  A religious boy who could not get enough God in one religion lives with a tiger in a small boat and ... I am not going to spoil it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It had me intrigued the entire time. I could barely wait to return to it.  Although I am not into pain and suffering, somehow this spoke to me more about survival.  Catching fire was great.
0399226907|4.0|I was so excited to buy this book for my daughter.  I still remember my mom reading it to me when I was a little kid.  Great quality but it was the small version of the book.  i thought it was going to be a little bit bigger.  Overall great buy!!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love all angry bird games.  love the upgrades and new levels added.<br />wish they would come out with more angry bird games
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I been reading about NED's for a long time and this is the first book that tells you about a NDE from a science point of view. This guy being a neurologist  ?  (I'm not sure if that's how it's spell) can explain you why NDE's are real and why there's life after death.  Please read this book with an open mind and you will see how wonderful this guy experience can change the way you think about death.
B003L77TZI|5.0|There are some songs on this CD that some of my younger friends hadn't even heard.  Very lively and upbeat!
0307887960|4.0|I was able to follow this book very well and lost 5 lbs within the first week. It is something that you would have to get used to doing and it isn't easy. You have to stick with it. btw, quit smoking and try exercising 30 mins. per day at least 2 weeks before you try  following this book as it will make life so much easier for you!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I think Despicable Me is a great movie and I am way past childhood with no kids. The soundtrack is really good and this movie overall was very enjoyable. I watch it every so often when I want to lift my mood. DVD quality is pretty good. Have not watched the blu-ray version. The download expired on me so was not able to use it.
0821210920|5.0|Although this book is a little antiquated, A.A. provides the reader with much of his knowledge and expertise regarding visualization, aperture, shutter speeds and the &#34;science&#34; that goes along with taking great photos.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|If you like the previous two seasons, then you will probably like this one - more weirdness coming ahead. But start with season 1 if you haven't already.
1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder is built on top of the D&D 3.5 rule set. The changes that the authors have introduced are both logical and useful in the games I run / participate in. Unlike the 3.5 core rulebooks, this one includes the information both for DMing and playing in one location. It's like the player's handbook and dungeon master's guide in one!<br /><br />Can't recommend it enough for fans of tabletop RPGs. Lots of third party modules and add-ons available to help you put adventures together. Satisfied with my purchase!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I really want to read the next two books in the series now, I just have to make room in my to read pile. Very fun read.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|The three austin powers movies, need I say more? I just love these movies, with their cheesy stories and silly humor. Good price for a 3 feature movie on blu-ray. Oh and just to let you know, there are 3 seperate discs, it is not all on one disc.
0385349947|1.0|Quite a self serving book , and quite unrealistic, from world bank to google to facebook, this is a story of upper class and elitist class folks suggesting to common people, which for many is unrealistic.

B004U8VX2M|5.0|Watched it with devotion in the 70s.  Now is seems more like watching a filmed play. I recommend it highly for the whole family.
B005HSL626|4.0|I enjoy playing occasionally.  I feel like it is a different kind of game and you don't have to progress through different levels.
B003U4ZQRK|3.0|What started out as a great premise lost its momentum.  I finished it to the end just because.  I wish it had ended with a more clear meaning.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like the different formations and choices for playing.  It is a lot of fun.and very relaxing.  It is a game all ages can enjoy.
B001NHNG64|5.0|A very gripping book, with a lot of surprises. Enjoyed immensley! I now am a fan of Lee Child and are reading his whole Jack Reacher series.
0380778556|5.0|When I was first assigned to read this book for an English assignment, I was far from ecstatic. I had a vague idea of what this Gothic romance was about, and I didn't interest me at all. But upon opening up the book it was hard to put down. The mystery and shady nature of the characters was enough to capture my attention, and the dark imagery just sealed the deal. Rebecca is one of the few books that I have considered reading again.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing and exhilirating and historical all at the same time! I would highly recommend Downton Abbey for any historical fan.

B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Thought this was a great quick read that has taught me a few new tips for the workplace, some I do already and some things I believe in but after reflection realize I have gotten away from.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This and the first book are fun stories.  A well crafted ending to the hunger games. I would like to read more of Suzanne Collins books.

B009HUB40Y|2.0|I also hate being stalked throughout the game by ads. Ran out of lives after 10 minutes and requires you spend $ to be able to continue. I'm not interested in &quot;asking facebook friends&quot; for help,  so,  UNINSTALLED!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I don't listen to that much music, but this CD is really upbeat and puts me in a good mood.
B00407PNY2|5.0|if you love a good old fashioned car chase movie through the city streets, this is the movie for you! Great cop movie from back in the day
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|I heard a lot of negative things before watching this film.  The critics made it out to be a boring flick and an excuse for some interesting visuals.  However, I still really, really wanted to see it and I'm glad I did.  Rise of the Guardians is an amazing movie.  While some of the dialog is a bit cheesy, it is excusable because it is a kids' film.  The animation was beautiful, the story was unique, the action surprisingly brilliant, and the underlying meaning was touching.  Great family film or a movie to watch to get in touch with the inner child that lurks inside us all.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|Read the book. See the 1977 Rankin-Bass Production. Listen to it as a book on tape. Make up your own version of what you think the Hobbit would be about and tell it to yourselv.<br />This movie was ridiculous. In includes superfluous, made-up scenes that detract from the feel of the story. It provides background that has nothing to do with the story of the Hobbit at all. Something that is beautiful about the book is that Bilbo finds a ring that is magical...and that's it. There is no crazy foreshadowing of its meaning in Middle Earth...which is what, I think, makes it so mind-blowing in the LOTR trilogy. They just packed in too much and tried to hard to create a link between this and FOTR/Saron/etc.<br />This book is far shorter than any of the Lords of the Rings books, and yet Peter Jackson wants to turn it into 3 near-3 hour movies? How very George Lucas of him...<br />Speaking of which, part of the reason why this movie bothered me so much as its portrayal of the dwarves. If you like Jar Jar Binks, I think that you will certainly be in line with the way the dwarves are presented in this movie; buffoons.<br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey can't decide if it wants to take itself seriously or make itself a kids movie. It reminds me a lot of Star Wars Episode I in that regard. What I learned from that experience was to not waste any more time hoping that the next 2 installations will redeem the first film...which is why I won't even bother with the next 2.<br />This is about money, not the story.  Save your money. Save your brainspace.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Once I got this device to work, I found that the light was really bright even in sunlight it's easy to see. The motion sensor works well. I placed this in my pantry to see if it would work and it did! It was bright enough that I could in the far back which was about 10 feet deep. However, it wasn't bright enough to replace the existing light in the pantry.  I felt like this is more of a great spotlight with brightness but not great depth in the lighting ability.<br /><br />Install was simple. I just used a simple screw in the drywall and it was done. I didn't need any special hardware since it was so light. I could see this used for small rooms but I would not use this as the sole light source. I received this item to review.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Brits know how to make an engaging series ... But then again I may be a little biased having come from the commonwealth myself.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great story and plot lines. A few story flaws here and there, but less than in most popular episode series.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is a great game that is not just for high end devices it will also work with kindle fire and does not require Wi-Fi access
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this series.  I didn't find out about it until January, so of course I now have all three seasons and can't wait til season 4.

B001LM1456|4.0|I liked the film, but it was not as good as the original Spiderman franchise, Iron Man, the Avengers or Thor.
0920668372|5.0|This is one of my favorite books to read to my son.  I actually get teary eyed every time.  It definitely touches your heart!
B005K2XUPK|5.0|The case is good looking with great protection from falls. The inside of the case has a felt that is soft on the Kindle and will not scratch the Kindle in any way.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have a Full ATX case and this thing barely fits! This is a jumbo sized cooler, but it does its job well. I have had zero cooling issues since I replaced my last one, even after turning my OC back up.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Always exciting and Connelly is an excellent author. Love his books and style. Characters are always interesting and p;ots are intriguing/
B00BESIKWM|2.0|I thought there was chance this would be better than the first one. I was wrong. The plot was very straightforward, it was just plain bad.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|multiple reasons forthis. reason one, free coins/ gems. I forget. reason two, its incredibly addicting. I reccommend this game if my name isnt Morgan freeman. its not.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My 8 year old daughter plays this game.  There are &#34;stores&#34; in the game that appear to be part of the game.  They are very cartoon looking.  My daughter spent a ton of money purchasing game upgrades not knowing that she was.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Crazy game. Try it. I really suggest giving in a try. you will be hooked after the first run. Trust me
1936608618|5.0|the book is well written, gives insight on how to perform more efficient and at a higher intensity, an overall awesome book
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was full of sweet romance, drama and some thrilling moments.  I have found that many other authors have copied this theme - but we all need extra romance and sweetness in our lives.
B005ZUR724|4.0|This is a great game. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because in order to get a mount you have to purchase it with real money. It is very addictive however, it's like WOW in miniature form.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love this book I bough the 2nd one !<br />I love the tv show that's what mAde me want to read the books !
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Although the affinity this show for indusing pain and grief, I could not stop watching it.  The character development and emotional involvement with these characters is phenomenal. I loved it.
B007704HO6|5.0|A simple and easily readable true story showing how man can depend on animals and how animals can give freely of their love to man. Two down and outs  curing each other of their maladies and totally depending on each other in a relationship almost beyond belief with an almost fairytale conclusion. I just couldn't put it down.
B0010HA68I|5.0|Purchased to clip a small camera.  Versatile, well made.  The loop on the short side could be a little bigger and stronger if it breaks, that would probably be the spot.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Cute.  It was just a little long.  Would recommend to 20-40 age group or anyone who would like to watch something light and capricious.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Almost better than bacon. Oh never mind it is even better than bacon!!! Even if that bacon was the best bacon ever!!!

B0058VW36U|5.0|My grandkids play this so much!!  they love it and so do I!  Great game!  Teaches eye hand cordination, great!
0547569653|3.0|I think Scott gives a bit too much credit to diet and not enough to his own personal determination. I tried a few of the recipes and found them pretty much awful, perhaps if you're already a vegan you'll find them appealing but to say you wont taste the difference..not so much. His story and accomplishments are worth the read and have no regrets about buying the book and hope my purchase will help put a dent in his Whole Foods grocery bill! :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Very accurate and dependable. Enjoy the commentators and some of the programs.  enjoy Wake Up With Al and Stephanie. Entertaining.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy of books will keep you reading until the end. In the end you will wish there were more, they are that good!
B001LX2J22|3.0|I liked all the Hannibal Lector movies. I even went back and watched Man hunter which I didnt too much care for but this movie was good.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|It is a great tv show... It keeps you engaged. Not suitable for kids.<br />Story line is pretty good. Like it
B000IKQMFO|1.0|Charming it wasn't. I agree with another reviewer - it was rather crude and tasteless, completely different from Downton Abbey. It is not the content but the treatment of the content that was different. People compare the films, but to me the only thing they have in common is that they deal with upper class Britons and their servants in an English manor house. Most of Gosford Park's characters are unsavory; there was no one you could really care about with the possible exception of Mary, Elsie, and maybe Parks, until you actually got to know them. The story itself was predictable (my husband and I knew one of the servant women from Sir William's past was going to kill him long before the murder occurred) and the dialogue, for the most part, was not particularly witty or interesting. In fact, any one of the guests or hosts could have been murdered and we couldn't have cared less. It wasn't humorous, it wasn't exciting, the investigator was without charm and the investigation (as much as we saw of it) was mishandled and thus dull for a murder mystery. As a comedy of manners, it fell far below Downton Abbey or any well-written English novel. We ended up not finishing the movie but reading the Wikipedia synopsis and felt more than justified in quitting when we did.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I do not like this app as it doesn't work like it does on the iphone/ipad. The screen is so jumbled up hard to read and see plus I can't seem to find the share button to post on FB like my Iphone.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I have a new favorite game! I can't remember the last time I yelled &quot;cool!&quot; or &quot;whoa!&quot; out loud while playing a game. I wish there were more than five stars to give.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Just got the Kindle Fire, downloaded my FB of course, and it's exactly the same as my Iphone. Thank god, as so far some apps on the Kindle are far different than the Iphone, but I guess I gotta become more familiar with the Kindle.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you like the fifty shades triology then you should read the corssfire novels.  Cant wait to read the last of the three.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Addicting, FUN, great effects! A++++++++. I would recommend this game. I guess the only thing I would wish is that they change up the screens a bit. Your either running on a path or Railroad, would be nice to have some different ways to run ect.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, this book is unprecedented. I haven't read anything like it in quite a while. I'm sixteen years old, and though some people say the author wrote the main characters, especially Hazel and Augustus, not true to what teenagers are like, I think that that wasn't the point. He wrote them the way we wish we could all be when faced with a terminal illness; he made them brave and witty. Living with something like that forces you to grow up in a way few will probably ever understand, in a way I will probably never understand.<br />This book brought to the forefront of my mind every thought and fear I had ever pondered about, and what it would be like to be in such a situation. It's so easy to get sucked into their world, and it reflects what I know I've felt from being on the outside looking in. The illness-repulsion, the pity in everyone's eyes. It's a beautiful work of art, and a must-read.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|A gut wrenching look into the hell of alcoholism with a coke addiction to round it out.  The nudity no doubt kept it off the Academy's top picks.
140053271X|5.0|I only wanted a small simple little e-reader, so this was perfect for me. Everywhere I go, I like to read. It's lightweight, so I can take it everywhere.... It's also easy to use. Not high tech at all.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best books i have read - very moving indeed and i would definitely recommend!!<br />The old saying - \\"a mans best friend is his dog\\" - so true. A wonderfully written story which has a bit of everything, there were times a would be laughing and then times a tear would trickle down my cheek. ENZO has definitely made me look and treat my Lab differently, it almost seems as if Max, my dog understand me now when I play and talk to him.<br />Enough said, purchase and read the book, I guarantee you will not regret it......enjoy the reading.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A wonderfully amazing little love/life story! Definitely one of my most favorite reads of all time, and that's no easy feat.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I love this book series. The show stays really close to what actually happened in the book, which is way nice. Would recommend.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I always check my homework with calculators so I was really pleased with this app I promise that you would never miss any fraction problem ever again!!

B0064TVQ5E|1.0|like the concept of the game, but on the particular one the drawings are tooo much alike. you get dizzy trying to figure out the difference..  I like the game, but I will delete this one and find one that has more color to the discs
B003EVWDR0|5.0|whole family movie. I loved it. my husband loved it. and so does our 6 month old. Can't wait for the next one to come out
0316044695|5.0|I really enjoyed this read and have so much respet for Luttrell, Murphy, Dietz, and Axelson!!! Not to mention the tons of other brave men in the Spec Ops community!! This book is very well written and I flet like I was by their sides throughout the book!
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I love this entire series. So does my husband, and my 6 month old. Keep em coming. Great series. Love it!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|If Amazon would allow no stars, this app would get it. Wasted .99 for something that will not allow me to set the alarm, has no music alarm which the description says it has. Basically it is a huge piece of deification requiring a full roll of toilet paper!
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I loved this movie. My husband loved this movie. And so did our 6 month old. Thanks for keeping so good movies on file!
B006LSZECO|3.0|A bit depressing, but picks up somewhere in the middle.  Didn't like any of the characters, but I guess that was the point.  Ending was disappointing.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|different. I thought this was gonna be more about the Tsar's I was mistaken. I was confused while watching this
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Looks nice and is durable as hell. I don't really use the sideways feature but I can see how it would be useful if someone liked to watch moves on it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|no what i expected at all. great point of view. i really enjoyed this one. Denzel Washington is a kick ass actor
B007PKOKTK|5.0|My grandson liked it for sure. As a side note don't leave your kindle laying around where your tech savey 3 year old can get his hands on it unless you have your kindle password protected.
B008602KQI|5.0|whole family movie. I loved it. my husband loved it. and so does our 6 month old. Can't wait for the next one to come out
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the Downton Abbey series! I am so glad that I can get it on my tablet, because I can watch it at my convience and not having to wait for the right day or evening it is on TV. Thanks Amazon for all you do to make life fun easier.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It don't take long to play. I would've liked to seen more hide and seek and wished I didn't pay to finish playing the game
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I started reading this book late last week.  I don't read very often but this was definitely one of those books I couldn't put down.  As soon as I finished with this Book 1, I immediately jumped on Amazon and bought Book 2 and when I finished it I immediately bought Book 3, and I am one that normally only reads what I can get for free.  I definitely felt the price was reasonable and have enjoyed the series.  Can't wait for Book 4.
B003M70O5O|4.0|I missed the first two seasons so had to go back and watch them, great show from the start and definitely answered some questions.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a gift to my husband. and he said it was a very good book. He is reading the sequel now.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|In more ways than one, Dr. Who is timeless.  Not only are the adventures fraught with excitement and suspense, the topics of social concern they address in a fun format, make this a series I highly endorse.  I could watch it with my kids, and not have to worry that any inappropriate voyeurism would slip out.  Dr. Who is the consummate gentleman.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My children are  3 and 4 and they simply love this game! It teaches them hand and eye coordination and just how to use their tablets to scroll.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Me and my hubby love this show. We have been getting caught up on amazon prime starting with 1st season up to the 4th season. It is awesome and we both love it.
B000V5ZIBU|4.0|Last year, and some the year before, I watched the entirety of TNG.  When you go all the way back to Season 1 of anything... well, a show develops so much over time that when it has a 5+ season run you tend to actually remember/love the middle to end of the show.  The early parts are usually a little bit shaky.  I'd say that Season 1 of DS9 is actually better than Season 1 of TNG (especially when you set aside any feelings of excitement that Trek was finally returning to TV with TNG).  For DS9, I didn't feel that episode plots were derivative (a complaint I remember about TNG vs TOS) and time is spent exploring various characters (not just one or two major ones). Also, being \\"stuck\\" on a space station isn't as limiting as you might think, if you had only known the premise of the show.  They explain what Starfleet is doing at Bajor, and touch on Bajor's history and current delicate situation. They set up things on the station and relationships between characters.  For example, Kira and Odo, Bashir and O'Brien, Quark and Odo, Odo's origin mystery, etc.  They even make you like characters you don't trust right out of the gate (Quark).  The actors all seem solid, even this far after it aired.  Special effects usually aren't too shabby, either.<br /><br />I waited a little bit too long to write this review and now I'm in Season 2, so I don't think I have any more thoughts right now about Season 1 except this: If you think you're liking Season 1 then you should definitely keep watching!!  Overall this is a great series.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch is really nice. It looks better than the picture. My husband really loves it and most of all it can be worn in his military uniform.
B004WR125O|5.0|This adapter works well in our situation - it's only about 15 feet from the router and pulls in an 85 -90% signal. Following the included instructions was easy and we had it connected to the network in about 5 minutes, or less. It's small and doesn't protrude beyond the front of our receiver more than the knobs do, and does not detract from the looks of the receiver. No antennas or wires to mess with either. Very happy with it.
B009JZWWGC|2.0|This is probably the worst trek movie out there. But if you are a fan... You still need to watch it!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Its the best show on TV. I can't get enough of some Emily Vancamp and Madeleine Stowe. That's the perfect pair for this series. I love them.
1609611543|4.0|My husband and I decided to try the Wheat Belly Diet for Lent this year. I have been having issues with daily hives for 4.5 years and have been tested for everything. My nutritionist friend suggested I try a gluten-free diet to see if a wheat intolerance could be causing the hives even though a blood test for Celiac disease was negative.<br />We started the diet 30 days ago. My husband (who will be 50 this year) has lost 12.5 pounds and better than that, his cholesterol levels are now all within normal range! We are hoping with time that the diet will help his high blood pressure issues too.<br />I have lost 5 pounds which puts me at or near my goal weight. Just as promised, the weight came right off of my midsection! My hives are still present but are controlled with only one daily medication so I think they are improving.<br />I really believe that there is a lot of truth to Dr. Davis' theory. We both have far fewer cravings (if any) and we both are eating smaller portions by choice! We have been able to find many good substitutions (parsnips for potatoes; spaghetti squash for pasta; cauliflower for rice; canned black soy beans for kidney beans)and really the only thing I miss is my dark beer!<br />There are a few contradictions in the book. In one section he says to go ahead and explore new cheeses, maybe try a Stilton. Later in the book he says to avoid all blue cheeses. I'm pretty sure Stilton is a blue. He also says that soy sauce is permissible but every soy sauce I've looked at is made from wheat.<br />Overall though, a good premise that really does work. We will be sticking to it beyond Good Friday and hope to see even more positive results!
B002361MLA|4.0|Very interesting and true insight into how we spend a good deal of time focusing on time rather than the present moment.  I found it interesting enough to read two times straight through and work on incorporating some of the ideas into my daily life to worry a little less and be in the present moment much more.  Not always and easy thing to do but definitely worth making it a higher priority.
B003L20IHE|4.0|i love this movie....totally worth buying it and the sender sent it right away..no problems at all i would tell everybody about it
B005LLSZNM|5.0|i WATCH THIS  SHOW WITH MY SONS EVERY TIME THEY ARE ON ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOW OUT THERE
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was a very well done movie but more amazing, it really happened. Kudos to Ben Affleck for excellent acting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a very deep novel. It kept you always asking questions. And talk about jaw dropping moments! A definite must read!!!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|It sounds like all of my favorite authoes put together. Theres nothing better than opening up a new book and realizing it is going to be way better then I thought.
B00122MWU6|3.0|The songs I like I love. The rest is filler or just crap. Yes, I know this is a concept album, and The Flaming Lips are out there musically.<br />Worth the $5.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|We love this show. We didn't originally start watching it, but caught a re-run around season 2. Now I must own the series. They are too funny! Appropriately priced for an entire series on DVD.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I loved this book. This is the book  I was waiting for.  Comtemporary subject, with John C's humor.  After reading The Gate House, which I did not like (I just didn't care about the characters in The Gate House) I was reluctant to try this new Nelson DeMille novel.  I loved The Panther, Plum Island, Gold Coast...all the previous novels. So I decided to give this one a try.  I think this was one of his best stories.  It moves alone, well written, and exciting. I could not stop reading.  And I look forward to the next adventure with John Cory (or Corey).
B000W91RUG|5.0|We love watching this show and having it on DVD allows us to watch it any time, over and over again!
0446693804|5.0|The book and the movie are very different. I loved the movie and the book made me fall in love all over again.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game allows you to set your own difficulty level. You can select an easier level if the kids want to play then choose a more advanced level for yourself. Download now for months of fun!!!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00881VLCE Magic Puzzles]]
1476712042|5.0|I cannot say enough. I absolutely love this book. I love the plot the characters. This will be a book I read over and over again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So refreshing...I can watch a show that I don't need to usher my children out of the room.  Details are so wonderful, characters are so deep.  Great casting.  Love some and hate some...but the next episode you love the ones you hated and hate the ones you loved.  I find myself so looking forward to the next episode as one episode ends.  Locations are amazing.  For all those that love historical fiction from England and the aristocracy, this is IT!
B00A757EFW|4.0|Reminds me of the good old days - love it!  love the music- must learn to move my fingers faster!
1616550414|5.0|I really love this book, if you are a fan of the Zelda series you will most certainly be a fan of this book. It incapsulates everything Zelda and explores your imagination.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like it because it is like the computer - easy to use and very easy!!!!!  very familiar graphics and symbols
B007WFR0QS|4.0|I think I had seen the video for 'Next to Me' a few times on Palladia.  I liked it alright but it wasn't until I caught part of her concert on the same channel that I decided to check out the rest of her music.  The stuff I found online was good enough for me to take the plunge and buy the disc.<br /><br />I really wish you could give half stars on Amazon, because this album was more a 4.5 stars for me.  Where it fails for me is with some of the mixing choices.  On a couple of songs the percussion is so amped and hollow that it can be hard to hear some really great stuff going on underneath.  Kind of like a thumping car speaker parked next to you, yet in my own car.  Maybe it's the trend in club friendly UK music...I don't know.  With repeat listens, I still don't care for it, but I'm able to tolerate it better.<br /><br />That said, I have really grown to like Emeli's voice, and especially this album.  She doesn't have the same vocal range of say Adele, Mariah or place your favorite power belter here, but her voice is honest and emotes emotion better than some of the power balladeers.  Also, the arrangements and musical hooks do a good job to get you moving.  I challenge anyone to not to move along with the music or sing along, particularly when she hits some of the choruses.  Heaven is a good example of that, and a great opener.  The girl can stimulate and motivate.<br /><br />Bringing up the vocal powerhouses above may suggest that Emeli Sande's music is in the same vein.  That's not the case.  We are not talking power ballads here.  I don't know how best to classify this - many of the themes are classic soul, the rhythm choices suggest some of the songs were intended for clubs, yet there is an earthy pop about it.  I don't know quite how to explain it, but for me, there is something honest and accessible going on in the music here, particularly in the lyrics.  On first listen, I was pulled to certain choruses and beat riffs.  On repeat plays, the lyrical hooks really set in.  Even though a couple of songs are about breaking up or 'Daddy' relationships, many of the songs are about staying together and appreciating the love you have, especially during hard times.  You don't see that too much in modern music anymore.  Being married for twenty-one years, I could really relate to some of the themes on display here.  The song writing on a couple of songs reminds me somewhat of Alicia Key's, which is not a bad thing.  It stays and continues to work on you after the song is done.<br /><br />My Kind of Love is an excellent example of both the good and the bad.  Really hate the flat, hollow percussion, but God that song owns me.  \\"Cause when you've given up; When no matter what you do, it's never good enough; When you never thought that it could ever get this tough; That's when you feel my kind of love.\\"  Perfect setup for the emotional payoff.  And she really nails the delivery.<br /><br />I personally found the affirmation of love in \\"Next to Me\\" refreshing.  I think it's the first single off the album released here in the States.  It's not often you hear a song that sings the praises of a faithful man.<br /><br />Overall, the music here is positive.  It's kind of a 'chick' disc, but as a guy, I was still able to connect.  A couple of songs deal with emotional pain of failing/failed relationships.  The strength here is the song writing and the lyrical delivery - which I'm happy to see the Emeli penned most of the songs herself.  I'm not going to do a song for song review. Music likes and dislikes are personal, and experiences vary.  A couple of the songs don't work for me.  That said, I'd recommend you give Emeli a listen online at her website and make up your own mind.  I wasn't disappointed.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This was very intriguing . I want to watch it over and over again . Would recommend it for everyone over 11 yrs old
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Predictable, but still enjoyable.  Easy to read while traveling.  I would recommend it for women, not men.  Nicolas Sparks's stories are great.
0646497855|5.0|Few weeks ago when I decided to retake IELTS I had a search on the internet for some useful information and noted target band 7.<br />I was curious about it and read all the recommendations and felt that I should give it a try.<br />From the beginning when I started to read this book I realised that it is exactly what people talking about. I went through the whole book and felt it is exactly what I need to conquer this exam. I 100% believe IELTS is about technique and you will be successful if you follow this book.<br />I'm now very confident to sit for this test but I do need a bit more time to practice.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|This is a new muscial find for me.  I truly enjoy listening to this album, especially at high volume. Thanks.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved it. Held my attention. Finished in about six days. Mainly nights, when I couldn't sleep. Highly recommend all of this series. It does take lots of patience and free time as well. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and think it was definitely worth the $1 rental fee. I don't think I would buy it.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's the sort,of book that you read with a smile on your face. I was quite sorry when I had finished it. I didn't want the book to finish but I couldn't put it down.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Love the screenshots and the step by step way it went through it. For a beginner to amazon publishing this was a great starter.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The plots and the people develop.  I especially love seeing how the culture was in the beginning of the 20th century.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this is my favorite  diary of a wimpy kid so far I think e everyone should read this book 5 thumbs up read this book
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Frankly, I'm tired of writing reviews.  I'm 68 years old and work a full time job and the last thing I want is to be obligated to write reviews of any kind for anything.  You have my 5 stars and that's all I'm prepared to communicate.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So beautifully written, it kind of hurts. But in a good way. I can't wait to read it again, darling.
0307592731|5.0|I realize I'm late to the fan club on this book, seeing as Oprah discovered at first, but I just had to stop in and review it because it's exactly what I hoped it would be from the author of Dear Sugar. I've been a fan of Cheryl's column for some time because she seems to have such depth and empathy for the people who write in. Yet her answers can be hard-nosed and surprising when the advice seeker seems to need that.<br /><br />So for me, reading Cheryl's own story about her mother's death, her heroin addiction, and her subsequent trek across the Pacific Crest Trail was everything I hoped it was. While there were parts that made me cringe, I appreciated that Cheryl didn't hold back from sharing the really gritty details of her journey.<br /><br />If your own life needs a little shaking up, or you just want to be inspired to look at yourself and the world a little differently, I definitely recommend picking up this book. It's a little like Eat Pray Love, without all the narcissism.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I had broken my ear tip from my current headset; the bluetooth still worked well, it just needed a new earbud. These worked perfectly. No complaints.
B005I4JG80|5.0|This was the first parenting book I read when I found out I was pregnant. I was looking for something that was a pleasant read and might give me some ideas of a philosophy that I might take, more than specifics. I mean, I won't even have a baby for another six months.<br /><br />This book didn't disappoint. I absolutely adored the author's stories of parenting in France, as well as her tales of culture shock. While French parents do a lot of things right, it was the author's experiences as an American learning these philosophies which made the book come alive for me.<br /><br />The only thing that made me grouchy about this book was the price I had to pay for an electronic Kindle copy. It's insulting for a digital book to cost within a dollar of the hardcover price, and had this book not been so enjoyable I would have been disappointed with my purchase. However, the positive reviews didn't lie and I found myself returning to this book more than once to reread a few of the sections that I found particularly inspiring.
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|I went ahead and bought the movie. It is not in HD (I guess except the Kindle/Xbox/PS3? ; edit, nope. I tried it on my PS3 and it still looks horrible). The quality is really like another reviewer stated: VHS quality. I didn't believe it, but yep, it's terrible. I think it may even be worse than an old high quality tape. Its not the connection speed either, as I have cable service with 30Mbps download. I feel ripped off and will call for a refund after I write this review.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|While the vast majority of this book held up to the promise of the two previous ones, it felt like it ended way too soon and like the author didn't actually plan out what was going to happen. I wasn't entirely sold on the ending and there were far too many loose ends which made the ending overall feel unlikely, unclear, and rushed.<br /><br />Without saying too much, I was also disappointed in the lack of depth in Lena's relationships with both her mother and the two young men she was choosing between. It's obvious she loved all of these people, but what wasn't clear was why. The author showed very few interactions that deepened the connection between Lena and others, so I was left feeling a little unsatisfied and disconnected from the events.<br /><br />This book reads like it was rushed to print, and while it shows a lot of Lauren Oliver's signature styles, the ending to a trilogy as popular as this one should really have been given more editorial guidance so the end result could be everything fans like me were hoping for.<br /><br />I'm giving it three stars because while I was reading, I was completely engaged and wanting to read more. However, as soon as I put the book down after reading the ending, I felt cheated and dissatisfied, like I wished we could go back and have a do over.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|One of the best shows ever on television. This was my second time to watch. Please keep this show available.  Can't find it anywhere else.
B00021R7CG|1.0|One of the lamest suspense movies I've seen. Nearly every military person disobeyed orders, and in the process were counted as heroes. Not even James Earl Jones, one of the finest actors of our time, could salvage a weak story line and wooden dialog.<br /><br />An example of the absurdity of the plot: throughout the nuclear crisis, nobody considered suggesting that the president simply pick up the hotline to the Kremlin and speak to the Soviet president.<br /><br />We were also able to witness a bomber shooting down and/or evading three Soviet MiG fighters.<br /><br />Not worth the time wasted watching, even if you can access the movie for free.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Definitely a good show, highly entertaining with lots of action. You can tell the budget was pretty low but nonetheless better then the previous one with Sly Stallone.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|I'm a baseball nut, so any movie about it is ahead of the pack. I also appreciate Amy Adams talent, so this movie had 4 stars out of the gate. I figure Clint was a baseball fan through his youth, and still has a thing for the game.<br />I found the movie easy to watch, with a few emotional up-down, back-forth trips. If you're not a baseball fan, it's probably a 3 star movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it but you have to be online and I wanted one I can do all this with out being online
B003AVPV1O|5.0|Need to connect to monitors and have the same things displayed on both monitors.  This does that without any interference or weird noise patterns.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Not sure what all the hype was about this book. It came highly recommended by so many but I really didn't see why. I struggled through the book and put it down several times to regroup. Finally finished it and feel unsatisfied. NEXT . . .
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Very watchable.  Not dumbed down like other shows.<br />Characters are interesting, complex, but likeable.<br />Looking forward to season # 2 !!!
B002KVSJ64|5.0|This album just rocks! Amazing lyrics that are easy to relate to and great music! It's the total package! Pick this album up now!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I thought I had it for 48 hours.  The kids watched it the first night and when I went to watch it the second night, it was gone.<br />The kids said it was okay, but I wouldn't know, because I didn't get to see it.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|What a thoroughly enjoyable book!  It raised many a chuckle.  Perhaps more importantly, it raised my awareness of how Asperger's syndrome manifests itself.  Because Graeme Simsion's character was so acutely drawn, one found oneself beginning to assess life and things in his manner...........I had better be careful!!!<br />I thoroughly recommend this book
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Beware, this game is ADDICTING! I love it! Sometimes too much!<br />Play at your own risk!<br />That's all I got..
B00B3MN65K|4.0|Not my favorite Josh CD but still enjoyable.  Have all of his cds and this is the most disappointing to date.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|This was a great animated movie and lots of fun to watch. I highly recommend it. Buy this and Part 1 and you can't go wrong. Who ever is a fan of the Dark knight will enjoy the story and action.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Love it , totally worth it, very fun to play, and very addictive.I  play it evey day when I get home from school
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love it, passes time well...  kids love it and at this point i'm just writing words to get to the minimum to post this review...
B0096CDG0O|3.0|The game has been great until about 2 months ago. I no longer get notifications when its my turn. I don't have time to check every 5 minutes to see if someone had played yet. I have contacted support 3 times and have not got any answer! Once notifications are fixed, this will be a 5 star game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story line was unique and had a great twist.  I was just a little dissapointed with the ending. Would definitely recommend reading the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book.  It was very exciting.  Great story line.  You could relate with the characters.  Nicholas Sparks has never let me down.  This one is my favorite book by Nicholas Sparks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I loved the characters and the story had some unexpected twists and turns.  Can't wait to read more by this author.
1476733953|1.0|My first review was pretty harsh, or \\"mean spirited, presumptuous and libelous\\" in the words of one commenter, so I've revised it so it's just slightly mean-spirited, a little presumptuous and not at all libelous. I'll also focus a little more on the content of Wool itself in this one.  Here goes:  Wool is an awkwardly written, boring, derivative sci-fi novel.  If you like awkwardly written, boring, derivative sci-fi novels, you'll probably like Wool.  If you like not awkwardly written, not boring, not derivative sci-fi novels, you'll probably give it 2 stars and call it a day.  The author of Wool, Hugh Howey, is a smart man and certainly better at marketing than he is writing.  He probably doesn't kick dogs, start fires or belong to the Westboro Baptist Church. He looks dashing in his scarf on his Amazon author page. I'm even told he donates his books to libraries, which is very nice of him (although I found said books to be awkwardly written, boring and derivative), because libraries are super places that are almost always criminally underfunded.  What Mr. Howey (or someone else, whatever) probably also did was buy some fake 5-star reviews on Amazon for his self-published novel, because getting noticed when you self-publish is really hard, and Mr. Howey is a smart man.  Mr. Howey and Wool have now most definitely been noticed.  In conclusion, I found Wool to be awkwardly written, boring and derivative.  If I'm sorely mistaken about the fake reviews,  I'm sorry and I'll find a set of stairs to climb for 100 or so pages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game if you like temple run then you will love this to I hope that you can also play with this game because it will blow your mind.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|A slow start, but the more I read the more interesting<br />and deep the stories became. Suggest not reading them<br />all at once - giving yourself time to think about the diverse<br />characters.
B005LAII3A|5.0|This was so much better than the original!  Not sure why it failed at the box office or why Schwarzenegger fans turned up their noses at it!  The action was break-neck, the acting was first rate... All I can think about is the various characters in each film battling it out... Sharon Stone getting pummeled by Kate Beckinsale... Or Ronny Cox getting the beat-down from Brian Cranston?  And the 'Plot':  The new version leaves Mars out of view, and takes Earth into the future where most of the surface is uninhabitable, leaving just two points left for human life to exist, the UFB [or United Federation of Britain] and the Colony [looking like an enlarged continent of Australia!]  and the only way to get from one place to the other, the 'Fall'  a masterfully conceived elevator through the earth's core!  The only problem was the end, which, either by flaw or design, left me scratching my head!  'Did Howser die or not?'  It left you wondering this as the last scene had Melina(Jessica Beal) trying to revive him!  Then it cuts to the credits too soon to tell?!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This wasn't a movie I neccessarily would have gone to see in the theater, but glad I watched via  Amazon video. I hadn't heard much about Flight, so was unsure of what to expect. Denzel Washington gives an unbelievable performance as a pretty unlikable character who is severely flawed and battling with addiction. The dilemma - for lack of better word  - of dealing with the aftermath of a place crash in which he was very heroic, coupled with the poor decisions he made before the crash and after make for a great story in my opinion.
B0019GJ4EC|5.0|Great Blu-ray quality. One of my personal favorites. If you are a fan of this movie then I think it would be a great addition to your collection.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have this game installed on my phone and on my Fire HD. It works great on both, but this is the one game I prefer on the phone. It's easier to tilt during gameplay.
B0024F08UG|5.0|As a firefighter, this is one of my favorite movie. Yeah the storyline is pretty hokey but Steve McQueen as a fire chief makes this movie the best!
B0091WUZJE|1.0|Movie was  a reminder of how poor these westerns of this time period were.  Movies have really come a long way!
B00B9366VO|5.0|This was one of the best documentaries on music that I have ever seen. I honestly did not want it to end.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I am a huge fan of this show and recommend it highly to everyone.  Tip:  when buying an episode first check which title you are looking at and then click the one click buy button.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a very good game and I LOVE it. Malibu Barbie is my virtual horse and the people who love HORSES
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This is a timeless story of good vs evil.  It draws the viewer in quickly and doesn't let go.  I love the 3-D version. Special effects and costumes are amazing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was absolutely beautiful. There are books that you enjoy, and there are books that just go deeper than you ever thought a book would go. I was bawling my eyes out uncontrollably, but it was worth it. This is a must read, and read slow so you can enjoy every last word.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Ellie Goulding got my attention a month back during the Super Bowl (That God of War commercial was dope). After some Youtubing and finally hearing \\"Explosions\\" I had to buy the album. I'm not a fan of modern Pop music but this girl is different. Her vocals are raw and she is one of the few who sounds really nice singing in an English accent. Her song writing, especially, has captured me; she speaking so softly at times then hits you with an epic line that takes a few minutes to completely grasp. A wholly impressive singer/songwriter (which in my opinion puts her in an elite class with Ell Varner, Adele, Keri Hilson, and the like, and yes I put unproven artist in \\"elite\\" categories, I'm a dreamer).<br /><br />Halcyon is a complete album and it didn't take me long to adapt to her sound and put this thing on repeat. I recently joined the rest of the world in picking up Adele's 21, but this is an even more complete album in my opinion. I don't usually like to suggest which way artist should go with their craft, but I hope she keep exploring this electronic-mixed-with-traditional-instruments sound she has going. Her and her producers have weaved the sounds so seamlessly that the electronic elements, that so often sound more like a gimmick, mix beautifully with her voice and traditional instruments. In short, her production is amazing.<br /><br />If you like anything you've herd of her in the past, I have to recommend this album. I was blown away frankly, and I'm so happy I found her so randomly. This is a women I'll be following throughout her entire career.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have thououghly enjoy all of Downton Abbey. The acting, the story - it is such a pleasure to see a show that does not have cursing, killing, and violence.<br />I cannot wait until the next series comes out.  I think most people who have seen this will say the very same thing.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I know I'm late to the party but damn I'm glad I'm here. Adele's voice shines on this album; the song writing is solid; and the throw back sound is executed so well it sounds as modern as anything else out there. A truly timeless album. There were some tracks (&#34;Turn The Tables,&#34; &#34;Don't You Remember,&#34; and &#34;Take It All&#34;) that just aren't for me, but even those are very well made. I love how the album changes style throughout, but I can't help but feel it's not complete. It may just be the songs I don't like breaking the intended rhythm for me, but I can't help but feel something is missing on this album.<br /><br />All and all though 4 stars captures my opinion of this album. I'm very happy with it, the ballads blew me away, but there's something missing for me so I can't appreciate it as much as other s have.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|My five-year-old grandson loved this family film with colorful action and characters he can relate to.  I loved the idea and execution of the plotline behind the film; and the voices of the characters of Jack Frost, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, and the Bogeyman were both spectacular and recognizable.  Highly recommended.
0843135689|5.0|i love it<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />logan lauren's son<br /><br />i really like the books roger hargreaves writes they are the best ever
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good flick, but the ending, which was exciting, was not truthful, and seemed like it was trying too hard to please.
B008M721MS|4.0|Skype in action :-)<br />looking good and very handy while using with my new kindlefire HD. Still improvements required for video chatting in 2g networks for other devices.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I love this movie in theaters and I still loved it on a smaller screen. The animation is amazing and the characters are well thought out. It's a great movie for adults, children and gamers.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Revealing U S Presential relationships since Harry Truman & Hoover. Absolutely fascinating!  Definitely a required reading for anyone who is a citizen of the U S.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|Made my kindle an Ipad. Great feature. Very easy to use. I like it a lot and highly recommend it.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|Good movie for kids about ten to twelve.its kind of a hardy boys nancy drew mystery, or at least n those styles
0670019933|5.0|Got exactly what I wanted in the amount of time I asked for. word word word word word word word.
B00138H876|4.0|In my own opinion, this is Bob Dylan in his prime. I liked Dylan from the beginning, but consider myself only a moderate fan. Nonetheless, I wore out my vinyl copy ages ago. I'm glad to have the full album in my collection again.
B0083ZBW2Y|2.0|Everyone dies.  I wanted to stop reading but I had to continue 'cause it was a required book for school.  I really didn't like it.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I missed getting to see LZ live back in the early days. Watching this recording captured the feel, with the added benefit of well-done editing. Kind of like having a moving front row seat AND binocs. If you have any affinity for classic hard rock at all, this is well worth the price. People will praise or fault a recording ad nauseum, but I'll leave it simply by repeating, &#34;well worth the price&#34;.
034544678X|4.0|I like the fact there are pictures in the book corresponding to the articles, and the book did meet my expectations. I enjoyed reading the book and learned a lot.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|I like the newer Star Trek series very much, but I grew up watching the original series back in the 60's.  I will always come back to watch more!
B00AYB20KI|4.0|Good movie horror movies aren't what they used to be.Or maybe I have seen everything scary there is to see?
B00AZ3027I|5.0|My grandson loved this reissue of the Peter Pan cartoon.  It was easy to access thru our TV and we will be able to watch it at the beach house also just by using Amazon Instant Video.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Very good game. Needs to be a bit harder and a lot longer. Not realy worth the money. But overall not bad.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I love Denzel.....but this movie just did not grab me. It was too negative of a character for him for my opinion.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think that there need to be more ways to get gold because you need it for emerald, sapphire, and ruby dragons. There should be longer names rather than just 8 letters. Over all I love the game, it just needs a few tweaks.
B0083Z614S|5.0|What a beautiful, charming book. An absolute delight. A book full of optimism, belief and magic!! Loved it as  child, loved it more as an adult!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was great, it had almost every word I looked up. I loved it I wish the book was bigger.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The premise of the movie was very good, however, the writing is lacksluster and does not use the talents of these two remarkle actors to full extent.  The writing is lukewarm at best!  Whata shame it could have been an amazing movie!  Watch once but don't expect to be blown away.  I was so dsapointed!  These two were way to good for this movie!
1454701250|5.0|I chose this book because I saw Geninne's page on the internet and she makes a lot of beautiful things. I loved this book and it is perfect for whoever wants to learn how to make a good impression with handmade rubber stamps!
B004NEY9EW|1.0|I really wish customer service would take it back its one of those moves with the giant blaqck bars above and below t so you have to squint at the tiny people!  I also don't beleive in downloadiing thngs to own, I want a hard copy!  I really wish customer service would just take ths back!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series reminds of a British version of &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34;, although a bit more intellectual. The characterizations are engaging and mostly realistic and the acting is excellent. For &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; fans, you will enjoy watching a younger Brendan Coyle (Mr. Bates) as one of the lead males in this series.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|the game is awesome but, after almost everything you do, theres a ad. but over all its really fun game because you can use all your creativity.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|My daughter likes this game.  It keeps her busy and also helps with math concepts like angles and making a plan.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|it is an awesome fun game for kids and adults.but I love it and I am 13 years old and I love it so much.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I watched because the story is based on what was heretofore oral history regarding a nearby family and locale.  It was a nicely crafted and well-acted film.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great story and acting.  loved the time period that the show took place in. would recomend this show to everyone
B003JTHXOK|3.0|If you are looking for just an easy some what entertaining read, this is possibly for you. I felt this book read more like a screenplay with the movie in mind. I almost gave up on it, but then got into it toward the end. It is a bit predictable and not one of Nicholas's best.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|boring. I thought it would be cute but I found nothing redeeming about it.  I would watch something else.<br />I really cannot recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutely love the whole series!  Very good acting and there is always some weird thing going on.  Look forward to every show.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|I've never been a fan of Nicholas Sparks' works but this movie was pretty good.<br />My girlfriend forced me to watch it, but I didn't dislike the movie, definitely the best chick flick I've seen.
B008J34466|5.0|Rarely do I buy an album where I love every song, even with Pink, and I love her. But there isn't a song on this album that isn't good and they are catchy as hell! Love it!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My girlfriend ordered this.  It was all right, nothing special.  Bit of a waste of time in my opinion but it was more entertaining than other chick flicks.
B008EKOO46|5.0|It is comprehensive, focused, clear. One of the best books I've read since &#34;Guns, Germs and Steel&#34; and &#34;Collapse&#34; and, like those books, it will change how you view the world today.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After watching Season 1 with a passion via Amazon Prime, I could hardly wait to get into Season 2.  This season adds the complications of WWI. There are some characters in this season that do not seem to move the storyline along or really serve a purpose...I would rather have heard about the in-between years that are not covered than the delusional Canadian.  Grantham's sister is also a great character but doesn't seem to have an actual &#34;place&#34; in the storyline.  Over all, however, this season is an absolute delight to watch - just as engrossing as the first season!
0143114085|3.0|Hmm, not quite sure what to make of this one.  Whilst I enjoyed the book and found it quite engaging, it is riddled with flaws and has one of the most unsatisfying endings ever.  The book loses its way in the last 50 pages and its resolution is terrible.<br /><br />The basic storyline is good - hysterical mother insisting her newborn baby has been abducted from her home and replaced with an imposter baby whilst those around her dismiss her as delusional and in the grip of post-partum depression.  Fabulous idea for a storyline.  The problem with Little Face is that the characters are not developed properly, rendering the excellent plot into second place behind poor and outlandish character/situation development.<br /><br />Alice, the protagonist, is not a very sympathetic character, I never really felt sorry for her, to be honest.  Her husband, David, overnight turned into a vile monster for no good reason, inflicting physical and mental punishments on Alice that only a warden in a particularly nightmarish prison would think up.  There was no reason for David to turn into such a monster, it was simply outlandish and unbelievable.  Detective Waterhouse was another poorly fleshed out character.  He was quite two-dimensional and there were inconsistencies in his character.  We are told in the book that he dislikes swearing and did not swear himself, having been bought up in an uptight home where swearing was not acceptable.  Yet, when he is interviewing a suspect and later when speaking with Alice, he constantly drops the f-bomb with the self-assuredness of potty mouthed chef, Gordon Ramsay.  Huh????  We also have another man framed for a murder, sent to prison for umpteen years for a crime he is innocent of, who makes no attempt to assert his innocence. He is boastful and proud of being known for murdering a skilled scientist, rather than loudly proclaiming his innocence as a normal person would have done.  What the????  I won't describe the twist at the end, as that is a spoiler, but suffice to say, it is hopelessly unsatisfying.  Alice's friend, the therapist from the health centre who is actually a detective working undercover from CID, was an absolutely ludicrous plot conceit.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I thought Little Face read like a movie script.  In fact, I think with a bit of tweaking, it would make an excellent television movie.  The bones of a shatteringly good story are there, but outlandish characterisation and situations badly lets it down.  Ms Hannah is an excellent writer, don't get me wrong. The pacing of the story was excellent, and the dialogue was very well-written.  It was simply too outlandish, with poorly drawn characterisations of the main characters.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is one of the best stories I have read so far.  I highly recommend!  About halfway through the series and I just can't put it down.
B001OSIV62|3.0|An interesting look from the inside of the planning and preparation of a modern daredevil as he conquers the world's tallest buildings.
B007REV4T8|4.0|best bond movie yet.great action..women were spectacular...the song skyfall won best song at the acadamy awards..i recamend this movie to  all
B008HJGPVO|5.0|My husband loves it longer than the usual stylus, the shorter ones suck they don't fit in your hand right this one is perfect and the 3 different sizes is awesome
B007J4T2G8|4.0|If you don't expect much from the book then it's a fun highscool-romantic read. I finished it within one night, easy read, nothing much to think about.
0374531943|5.0|This is not the autobiography of Mike Collin's life, the third astronaut on Apollo 11 (the one who stayed at the Command Module orbiting around the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin landed and walked on it), but rather his view of the time between him applying for the first time to become a NASA astronaut until his return from Apollo 11.<br /><br />And this is also my only (albeit minor) problem with this great book, as I would have loved to hear more about his life, both before and after Apollo 11. Mike is way too harsh with himself and doesn't give himself due credit for his great achievements during his NASA days, and probably thought nobody would find his life interesting enough to warrant a book about it.<br /><br />From the very first page the reader is confronted with an honest, down-to-earth next-door guy, who, through some freak accident in life, happened to be part of the crew that first landed on the moon - well, that is what he wants us to believe, but it is clear from his book that he actually worked very hard to earn his place on Apollo 11. The conversational style and Mike's honesty makes it an easy and catching read, but don't expect many surprises, as the flight of Apollo 11 has been through so much scrutiny since 1969 that probably every second of it has already been described somewhere. He is also not afraid of talking about subjects usually not glamorous enough to be treated in books (like astronaut's bowl movements).<br /><br />Overall, reading this book feels like having a long and interesting talk with Mike, who openly answers your questions very straightforward, but always downplaying his role and achievements. By doing so, you get a good view of what it was like to be an astronaut during the 60s in NASA, probably the most interesting and intense period in its history - highly recommended.
B003Q6CUAI|5.0|After trying almost every diet on the market at last I have found one that suits me.  It is very simple and easy to follow and the weight falls off!  Now, having completed the first phase andlost 5 kg in 11 days, it is time for me  to continue to the next stage and learn how to keep it off!
B004GTOKJS|5.0|Those who enjoyed Cranford will be happy to continue the unfolding stories with Return to Cranford.  The excellence of acting and story line is not diminished.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This is the best show I've seen in a long time. I know everyone says this but it has such a deep plot. Once  you are done you are left wanting more. I cannot implore enough how much everyone who likes good storytelling should see this show through to the end. I actually paid $130.00 for the Blu-ray, dvd, digital copy pack. It was money well spent.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|Unlike our last purchase we had to modify our DVD player to watch this series. The content is of course excellent - as is the quality
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|More gripping and captivating than the first season. The stakes are definitely raised higher in this season. Simply put, best show on television. I like this even more than I liked Dexter seasons 1,2, & 4. And those were good seasons.
B002XZNHG4|5.0|C'mon, it's Annie Hall. You don't need me to tell you it's a classic. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you have, see it again.
B004Q08BE2|5.0|This was a fantastic movie. I am a guy and I actually enjoyed this movie for all it was and not just how sexual it was. Brilliant.
B004I744AS|5.0|Great dictionary with an array of features besides just the standard dictionary as it pronouces the word, gives an array of words to be used theasarus, and defintions.  Great find!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play this daily. It is a lot of fun. It's like I have my very own horse, since I can't have one for real.
0743277708|5.0|I read this way back in middle school and absolutely loved it. I'm pretty sure I cried, but that's beside the point. I wanted to add this to my collection because it is such a great read.
076115728X|5.0|Sooo happy I bought this!  My little one tends to get on the perfectionist side and I think this book is a must have for that.  Now whenever she makes a mistake, she turns it into an opportunity for a creation - her artistic talents have developed so much further b/c of the message this book conveys.  Huge thanks to the author Barney Saltzberg!!!
0446310786|5.0|I read this book way back in high school. I loved it then and I love it now. I just wanted to add it to my collection.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Enjoyable. Not a masterpiece but a good, fun read. Characters are well- developed and inspiring. Teens should enjoy. Adults as well.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I love the combo pack. I currently only have a dvd player, but figured I would get a Blu Ray player in the future. I also wanted the digital download because I will be living in an area without internet this summer, so I love that I can have it on my laptop and not have to take my dvd's with me. I wish I had gotten the first season as a combo set.<br /><br />As for the storyline, it mostly follows the books... there are a few tweeks to the events, but they lead to the same outcome. Nothing to lose sleep over. I can't wait for the next season! Completely addicted.
1616550414|5.0|Wonderful art that shows the growth of the charecters. Has a timeline for how all the games intertwine. Great for fans.
B005PK56TA|5.0|If you like the horror genre then you would like this.  It has just enough creepy factor and surprises to keep the show interesting.  The story is well told as well, it keeps you guessing until the very end.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I knew something was wrong but wasn't sure what. I can remember growing up and having some of them feeling of wanting to be long but also not wanting to be seen. Sad but good ending.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|I love this album! If you love neo-soul, jazz, and o'skool east hip-hop, you will love this album. That's why it won a grammy. Good music
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have been hooked on this series since the very first episode. I love all the characters. the way they talk and their costumes are amazing. everything is just so precise. I could watch the old episodes over and over. If I could rate this 10 stars I would.
B007DIQC90|5.0|How many CD's can you say you love every song? This one is awesome. Great vocals, lyrics...everything. The Iceland accent gives the songs a slight haunting effect that makes the songs run through your head all day. Not that I'm complaining!
0802473156|5.0|It really helped my marriage!!!<br />Apparently, 15 more words are required so I'm just gonna blab on here until done
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Excellent entertainment, adore the challenges of every level; and it become a competition between the members of my family and myself. Pure enjoyment. And most of all; the sounds make me laugh.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|The storyline of this is simple yet complicated. Easy to follow and understand with enough drama and emotion behind it. The music is inspirational and complex. You will fall in love with it.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|I bought this movie because makes me have a good time although my husband says this is a chics movie, I do not care. Is nice, enjoyable and relaxes me.
B00B9366VO|4.0|Not the greatest documentary in history but really entertaining if you are into rock and roll and music in general.
B00797MB0O|4.0|The movie was a little over the top, but had a ring of truth to it.<br />Excellent acting all around.
B00BESCJII|1.0|I was very disappointed in this movie and consider it a big waste of my money. The subject matter trying to make &#34;weird&#34; seem as if it is normal, in my humble opinion, is a mistake. Although the actors in this movie did a excellent performance, I do wish that I had saved my money.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is well worth the purchase price. Now that it's a free app of the day this is a no brainer. Get this game! You WILL love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a great game I recommend is for anyone my 5 year old chain can play it and hes great at it!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000VZJUGY|5.0|Takes me back to a good place every time I hear it. Rocks beginning to end. Classic Nine Inch Nails.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|His beats are amazing, and the content is very sexy.  Probably not the best for children though.  Def buy the edited version.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|Dis not watch yet , however was delivered timely as promised. I wanted to have my own copy to watch at my leisure without having to borrow from elsewhere.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Terrific book, couldn't put it down! Already purchased another by this author. Will definately read all of her books, can't wait for the next one.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|This book will cause you to do that and make you a better at thinking.  Gladwell does a great job of showing us how we can better ourselves in the world of thought.  Great read for anyone who ever wants to get better at problem solving or just learn to trust their guy.
B0091THRCU|3.0|This pouch was too tight on my iphone. I am going to return it. It's really hard to pull the phone out of this.It damaged my $15 screen protector because it is so tight that you really had to force it out of the case even after pulling the tab. And also probably they used some cheap paints inside the case as a result I got black stain mark on my phone back now.
B006CHML4I|4.0|This is a nice, well made mechanical watch, but more a lady's size watch. I can recommend it to any buyer who likes a watch of this size.
B002GHHHPQ|3.0|I love the the picture has nothing to do with the actual case, i don't like those type of cases the only case i got out of my 27 war film collection lo. But thx anyway
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is an incredibly smart, well acted & directed drama.  Fabulous casting and storyline and it's difficult to stop watching, especially when you purchase the season.  Watched all of Season One in 3 days.  Shared it with family and they stayed indoors during some days on a recent trip to Hawaii because it was soooo good.  Enjoy!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|great app my 4 yr old and enjoy playing this game. i'd recommend this game to young and old alike!
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|Sweet premise for a film, but it really wasn't my cup of tea.  A tad too slow and story didn't really develop enough to get me to really care about the characters.  It would be interesting to know what kids think about it.
B00164KYV4|4.0|The opening lines and events in the beginning was very eye opening . The movie was cheesy but had a definite and clear message !!! I feel that this was important for females to see especially my teen daughter . Dont demean yourself by trying too hard . If this is you read women who love too much by robin Norwood . I was one of these women in my marriage . Luckily I matured/ woke up to realize my husband of 16 years was just not that into me . I tried but got stone walled and ignored.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I like the puzzles, but sometimes there are glitches that make the game not function as well as it should.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a really fun game. Unlike many of the free games out there you don't have to drop a lot of or any money to keep playing.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I really enjoyed this season, it set the stage for the rest of the series really well. I highly recommend it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is the lead tablet calculator and works very well  the calculator has the options of square roots and fractions
B00632HWOG|2.0|this was almost twodays of wasted effort to get this app to work............JUNK. never would synch up or log into the mail account even after trying two more times to relaod it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It has lots of action and variety.  My granddaughter just loves it and plays all the time.  Definitely worth the price, for the many hours of &#34;quiet&#34; time here at the house!!
B00068TJM6|5.0|Love it love it love it!!!! Product as described and i cannot wait to start wearing it. You should buy one. Just make sure you do not get it scratched like I unfortunately did.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Granddaughters just love this because of Perry the Platypus, Very thought provking and makes them use problem solving skills.  Many hours of entertainment,
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book takes you along on a spiritual journey without trying to convert your soul. I found it to be a pleasant escape from life.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Both the 12 year old and 8 year old find things to do with this game.  very versatile.  Entertaining also.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I can't really think of anything more to say than I liked it. It just felt like an easy read
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My daughter and granddaughter watch this and I was curious, now I'm as addicted as they are!! Very good story lines, action packed with romance and intrigue!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I have not finished this book yet but it doesn't feel like it really want's to get off the ground. I have not found the reason behind the endless explanation.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Its OK but a little boring.All it is is tapping places so very boring. Thinking of deleting it. But I guess its OK for people who like tapping games. It even works on a Nexus 7 which is pretty cool.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this story, although it did not wow me.  It flowed smoothly and the plot was very interesting, colorful characters and good ending.  I have not seen the movie but it seems from previews I've seen that several things were changed in the movie.  I'll probably rent it when it is available.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This season, it seems to be winding down... But, it is still our favorite show to watch on Monday nights. Since my wife and I don't have cable...
B008I43DYU|4.0|It is handy to ave on my kindle.  I don't have to go looking for another calculator. Very handy app!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The season has been great... The relationship that the main characters have \\"away\\" from work, makes the show even better...
B006QNDDHW|5.0|This book is a great reference work for doing presentations, but its power extends beyond that industry. If you're smart, you'll look closer and realize this book involves the building blocks for the following:<br />- Story Structure<br />- Youtube Vids<br />- Screenwriting<br />- Visual Storytelling<br />- Demographic and Demos<br />- Infographics<br />- CD and DVD Cover Design<br />- ebook Cover Design<br /><br />That's enough for now, trust me, if you look closer, this knowledge jumps over industries, artistic endeavors, and personal projects.<br /><br />I liked this book because it is a repository of knowledge for many fields, think of it as a mini-library.<br /><br />I have no idea how to compare this product because I don't know what other books are like this one, sorry about that, you have to read the other reviews for that.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|A good romantic comedy.  If you like this genre then you will enjoy this one.  Ford is in the movie, but he is not the star that makes this one shine.
B004Q1JN6Q|4.0|This movie has everything you'd expect.  Lots of action, some good fight scenes, witty banter.  It was exactly what I'd expected, but fantastically entertaining.
0062127241|1.0|To paraphrase Upton Sinclair, \\"Those who enjoy Townshend's music would do well to not examine the process by which it was made.\\"<br /><br />I did not buy this book, it was a gift. Had I been inclined to buy it, I would likely have read the reviews here and ran quickly away.<br /><br />Where to begin? First of all, I am in my fifties and grew up with Tommy and Who's Next. A good album and a great one. I also own a couple of Pete's solo CDs. But to read Pete's tome on how it all came about, one would think being selfish, petty, crass and egotistical were the key. Filled with drivel about his lonely life and how little he was understood, peppered with paragraphs about him losing control of his bowels in hotel rooms and consuming copious amounts of drugs and capped off with egotistical statements that assert the Who changed the world (!!!), it's amazing I almost made it to the end. I tried...I really tried but this book is as interesting as hearing an accountant read the daily statistics for the stock market.<br /><br />You've been warned...now quickly...run! Fast!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|THE CD IS A MASTER PIECE OF MUSIC. THE JAM SESSION WITH STEVE STILLS AND JIMI HENDRIX IS AMAZING... I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD FOR ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO LOVES THE MUSIC OF JIMI HENDRIX
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Great soundtrack, to go with an amazing movie.  I love all the songs, however I wish it had the song from the part in the movie with the battle scene.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Time flys when you are on it.  It's lots of fun.  Especially love the fashions, music and gardening.  Getting more followers everyday.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Have read all of John Grisham's novels. Is my favorite author. The Racketeer was not one of his best works. Still like to read a Grisham book.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|enjoyed this film, love Denzel acting, excellent visual graphics, lots of air action inside the plane also.shows the human side .
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good graphics for free game.  Very nice tile layout for each game.  Four different group of with 14games in each.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|great film and acting lots of intense viewing of the scenes,great director shooting, interesting education of what may have occurred at that time and place.
B00136JT3Y|5.0|I bought this after seeing Pink in concert.  She is a fantastic artist, and this albums has several of her well known hits, as well as a few surprises.  I did not know her for her ballads, and the album has a few nice ones that showcase her talents in that genre.  I highly recommend that you ad this to your collection.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Love It!!!! lots and lots of expected BOND action in the bond series films since they began,<br />I think daniel craig is great for the new roles as 007.
B00BN2CY7G|4.0|Very good download.  Several catchy tunes you will soon hear on the radio.I highly recommend that you download this and add it to your collection.
B007NU54H4|5.0|I personally don't sit around and watch Tinker Bell but the kids love this movie and that's what Important. I would recommend this movie for kids and adults that love Tinkerbell based on the fact that my kids love this movie so much.
B005HSL626|5.0|My children are into swords, smashing things, and video games.  My wife and I want to encourage hand-eye coordination and a good sense of humor.  This game combines them all.  In this version of Fruit Ninja, we have found a way of channeling my kids desire to slash and bash without exposing them to the current tide of zombie games and first-person shooters that are available to the general public.  Moreover, it really is just fun to play.
1400049628|5.0|Having all those 22 cal round for those Zombie killing rifles might not be enough. Get yourself 100% educated with The Zombie Survival Guide. It might be the only thing that separates you from the living dead!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I have played this game a long time ago on my DS1. It is very similar. I would like to see more games come out on my Kindle.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Love the graphics,gorgeous pictures!  Just started am a little confused but plan on learning as I go! Will update later!
B00AFEY354|4.0|Love the story line and great conversation about its characters. Would recommend this to children at least 14or older. Good
B005C0DHEY|5.0|America is reaping the blessings of being rich in natural gas but are they really blessings. The extraction of that gas is proving very dangerous to our environment so all of us who live in cities and don't see first hand the side effects of gas extraction should see this documentary to get informed about this problem and decide if it's really worth it.
B000058983|1.0|Obviously I don't know anything about music but I just hated this album. I've read this is the \\"quintessential psychedeic album of all time\\". I'm not buying it. Sounds like every other damn pop band from the 60's. Wasn't impressed at all. If you want PSYCHEDELIC music, go listen to something like Piper at the Gates of Dawn or Electric Music for the Mind and Body. I couldn't even finish side two... I turned it off after the \\"snot on my pants\\" lyric or whatever it was.. just horrible. I'll throw this in with all the other \\"masterpiece albums nobody else knows about of the 60's (which in my ears are just as bad) : Thirteenth Floor Elevators, Pet Sounds, Odessey and Oracle, and Forever Changes. I could do without all of it. Give me some Dead and Floyd. Give me the real psychedelic goodness, not a bunch of pseudo psychedelic garbage. Thanks. Fire away.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie. Fairly historically accurate. Affleck delivers once again as a director. The makeup and costume team onocked this one out of the park. One of the best films of 2013.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Wonderful show!  I love Captain Janeway...such strength and so much heart at the same time.  I love how the crew becomes a family.  What a wonderful message of human relationship.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|Stone of Tears is a great way to pass time. The writing styles used help engage you in the the story, with constant twists and turns that leave you on the edge of your seat.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Loved the story!  What a touching and beautiful insight into the way we look at ourselves and the world around us.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|It was good. The action was great. This is the best Daniel Craig series Bonds. ;) It should give back a great return on enjoyment.
B002MR908M|5.0|MANOWAR&#62;chuck norris. not alone but together they could stop him. this album on vinyl proves it. four more words required.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I received the mouse earlier today and i am really enjoying it. It is a little bigger than i thought but that is not a big deal. The three buttons on the side are more comfortable for my thumb than i was excepting. Over all its a good mouse and the weights are really nice because without it the mouse is really light.<br /><br />The only thing i do not like about the mouse is it was kind of difficult getting the weights into the mouse but other than that can not be happier!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|very interesting story line.  it gives an unique perspective to god and sexuality as seen from a disabled individual and a sexual surrogate.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|This a great YA read that kept this adult on her toes and turning the page! If you enjoy a read that is at a light pace and of a dark subject, you too will enjoy Pretty Little Liars.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Had my heart racing at the end. What a sweet love story!  I hope all of his books are this good.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I purchased this as a gift for my husband, and when he opened the case, there was a large gauge in the cover!  It would've been a lot of unnecessary headaches to try to switch it, just didn't understand why that wasn't listed when purchasing.  My impression of the buyer has been lowered based on this experience.  It was my first negative experience (and thus, a detailed review) through any Amazon purchase.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|District 9 is an absolute masterpiece. Easily my favorite alien movie. It really makes you view the world in a different way.
1616550414|5.0|I bought the japanese edition first, and right the english version arrived, I compared every single page, and it's better, bigger, and with some diagramming corrections. There is some details in the art at japanese version that got lost due the small print size, and that is perfectly visible in this english version. And the contrast is better too.<br /><br />Thanks!
B003R0LBVW|4.0|Interesting read.  Easy to get involved with the characters.  I got a little bogged down with the political back story, but aside from that it's a good read.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I loved this game but as I started playing the hammerhead, it completley restarted!  I thought oh well those things happen... then once I was back it did it again!!  as much as I enjoyed this game I'm done with it.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This is another great book by a great writer. Easy to read, easy to follow and hard to put down.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Don't understand why this movie received best picture.  It's just another movie.  Call it a historical documentary if you will.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is an awesome show even before Blu-ray.  This show is a classic for Sci-Fi fans or for those who enjoyed the anime Cowboy Bebop.  If you love this show you might want to consider buying Serenity.  This show was canceled by Fox, but did have a movie to finish of the series (Serenity).
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I've loved this movie since I first saw it as a child in the 60s and shared it with my daughter as soon as I could. This was a present for her 30th birthday and we watched it immediately singing along. It's a wonderful story and a beautiful edition to our collection at home.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This movie is beautiful.  People have complained about this movie's story, but it doesn't change that this is a great piece of movie history.  A lot of advances were made to 3D movies and Computer Graphics.  Having all the special features the explain this is very nice to have for any avid movie goer or critic.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have seen The Piano Guys on youtube and i'm so glad to finally get their cd. They are great people with great talent listening to them makes me happy, thanks TPG. This is a must buy. I'm not sure why anyone would leave a bad review. I also purchased [[ASIN:B00A994EEA Lord of the Rings]] [[ASIN:B00ANRJMW2 Mission Impossible]] by TPG.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Great series!!!!! I could not stop watching it, it kept me on the edge of my seat through every episode.
1616550414|5.0|Excelente servicio. Me llego el paquete en muy buen estado y a tiempo.<br /><br />Excellent service. The package stay came in time...
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great ideas for home organization and ideas for the kids for educations reasons and their rooms! Helps me dream of what I can do for my current home and what I want in my future place.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I first listened to \\"Tales\\" back in 1973, on vinyl. The A side of the first disc (The Revealing Science of God) is the only piece of music I know that has the power to make the hairs on my neck stand on end to this day, 40 years later! Rick Wakeman's synthesizer playing is just amazing. Probably one of the most beautiful and thrilling songs I've ever listened to. You're in for a real treat.
