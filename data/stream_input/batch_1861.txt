0307346617|5.0|I'm not a voracious reader. I might pick 1 or 2 non-techie books to read per year and I was glad to pick this one up. Wanted to read it before the movie came out to compare. The book & movie trailer seem completely different so I'm glad I checked out the book first.<br /><br />Overall I felt it was well done and written in a way that made the accounts seem plausible. Well worth the purchase in my opinion.
B002CNV52A|5.0|I did buy this Album just for THE COUNT OF TUSCANY and I find out  a great whole Album. DREAM THEATER. The best of all the time
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I read the first book and although it wasn't the best book I've ever read, I did enjoy it.  But I can't get through this one!  I get it, I get it, they like to have sex.  Where's the rest of the story?  This will go into the pile of 'Never Finished'.
0553384775|2.0|Synopsis: Jordan Belfort describes his wildly drug and sex crazed lifestyle that is fueled by  uncontrollable wealth which eventually destroys him.<br /><br />The story starts off with humble, interesting beginnings but quickly spirals down with a self righteous and grating reflection of the storyteller's genius, success and arrogance. I felt I was reading some drivel from Ben Mezrich
B0071XO8RA|5.0|at first my  husband was not too thrilled but as he read on, he was hooked.  great set of books
B008MM9630|3.0|I love this game but am rating it three stars because you have to buy the expansion for the farm with real cash .  If we could use the fairy cash I'd rate it five!!!
B00008FJYC|3.0|The record is warped, very obvious damage. Still playable after the first song on each side.<br />Oh well.  would try other products, its the chance you take with things. not like i spent lots of money, why do you need so many words anyway.
B0080K3G4O|5.0|A personal paradigm shift for me! I'm finally relieved of the dichotomic entrapment between participation in the &#34;Cult of Optimism&#34; and resignation to &#34;ironic curmudgeonhood&#34;. Hurray!

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Ok I bought it for the lazy song but the rest are just as good or better.<br />I'm a new fan!
B009CPES4I|4.0|A fun movie to watch.  Not brainy or too silly, but a nice evening diversion.<br />This film had a first rate British cast, which I felt added a lot to this movie.<br />The whole premise of the film is somewhat unbelievable, but that what films are usually all about.<br />Worth the $5.00.
B0000C9JCM|5.0|Wonderful versions of great music. I have truly enjoyed the the CD. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Try the CD THE CD IS GREAT..

1401225756|5.0|But I can't give away the original editions!  So I buy this to share.  Volume 2 is a lot better but it's hard to read volume 2 without volume 1.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|4.5 stars for this absorbing story. The extra bit is for keeping me on my toes. Lots of surprises are contained herein, some delightful, some appalling. I can't write a short review for this story line, so it's long, but it's spoiler free.<br /><br />In The Duchess War, Robert, the duke who would be a commoner, falls in love with Minnie, the star who would rather not shine.<br /><br />The first half of the story was fairly light, yet peppered with historical bits about sedition, the abuse of mill workers, and the bias in the English courts. The second half? I nearly threw the book against the wall at one point. No, twice! The characters took me through the wringer!<br /><br />The tragedy would be too much, if not for the comedy -- the flirty, witty scenes, like when he's wiping the gobs of paste off her. Being so close, things get a little hot and \\"his brains turn to paste\\" (in his words). ツ<br /><br />In addition to the intensely emotional explosions (!) and the lighthearted flirting, there are numerous poignant and ♥-warming scenes. I loved these scenes, especially involving his \\"friend\\" Oliver and his cousins, Sebastian and Violet (a sequel for Oliver and Sebastian, no doubt). Also, this book contains several love scenes. It's sexier than most of Milan's books, I think.<br /><br />This is Minnie and Robert's love story, set mainly in Leicester in the autumn of 1863, but it's much more than a romance, and the secondary characters play key roles, especially Lydia and Oliver.<br /><br />We see a little of Serena and Hugo from The Governess Affair, but about 29 years have passed. Serena and Hugo have a grown son, Oliver. Oliver has a best friend, Robert Alan Graydon Blaisdell, Duke of Clermont. Oddly enough, both Robert and Oliver are left handed. They both have the same ice-blue eyes, too. Sinister indeed!<br /><br />But where Oliver grew up in a loving family, courtesy of Hugo and Serena, Robert grew up virtually an orphan, without any real concept of family. His dad -- worse than a zero. His mother -- not worthy of the title, IMO. Criticism: (Robert's \\"mother\\" did NOT deserve the happy ending she got in the epilogue. Why not give Minnie's elderly great aunts that happiness? They were more deserving, risked more, sacrificed more, and loved far better. What the heck did Robert's mom ever do for him?<br /><br />Throughout the book (a little too often), Milan takes pains to ensure that readers sympathize with Robert for his horrible upbringing and admire him for his determination to be NOTHING like his slimy sire. Robert's longing for family had me gulping a few times. Milan superbly conveys his deep yearning for someone to see him  -- not the duke, but the man. There is one poignant part, where Robert remembers all his empty years at Eton and Cambridge, without any Christmas cards, without any birthday greetings, without any letters from home at all, while his middle class best friend Oliver, a scholarship student, gets and gives all sorts of little goodies each Christmas, each birthday, and throughout the years. These poignant scenes had me glued to the page. ♥<br /><br />Oliver Marshall is integral to this book, especially towards the end. The long friendship between Robert and Oliver is tested. Robert is caught on a dilemma, and feels he must make a terrible choice. But was this a plot device? Did Robert, a powerful, wealthy nobleman, really have no other recourse? Maybe not. (And anyway, storytellers must steer the plot. I suppose Milan wanted that outcome, so everything would be out in the open, in order for the epilogue to take place.)<br /><br />Then there is Minnie. Clever Minnie. ツ When Robert wonders why she goes by that nickname she replies, \\"Hello. My name is Wilhelmina, but you can call me Hell.\\"<br /><br />Minnie pretends to be a nothing, but she is a brilliant strategist, and she sees Robert immediately, sees behind the ducal display. So of course he is drawn to her.<br /><br />Kudos to Milan for creatinga Plain Jane! Minnie is no beauty: \\"Her lips were thin and her nose was sharp and a bit on the long side\\"  but Robert is immediately drawn to her. In his view, she's got \\"magnificent tits\\" to match her sultry, sensual voice. Plus, he loves her bespectacled shining gray eyes.<br /><br />\\"You see, there's this woman.\\"<br /><br />She wasn't going to look at him. She wasn't.<br /><br />\\"Normally, one might say that there was a beautiful woman -- but I don't think she qualifies as a classical beauty. Still, I find that when she's around, I'd rather look at her than anyone else...She ties me in knots.\\" ♥ ♥<br /><br />But Minnie is afraid of crowds. Afraid of mobs. Can't stand to have lots of people looking at her. So she hides, looks down, looks away. Her fear of looking up, of believing in a better tomorrow, is a central theme in this book and metaphorical for her fear of flying -- and falling.  (Milan repeats \\"look up\\" ~20x. Overkill.)  For Minnie has soared once before, soared until she crashed against the rocks. Almost literally, for Minnie is hiding a secret. The mild scar on her face is nothing compared to the deep scar in her psyche, for an emotional wound incurred when she was 12 years old. (Again, Milan brought me close to tears. I read Minnie's tragic childhood with my jaw on the floor. Couldn't believe what happened to her.)<br /><br />Anyhoo, Robert encourages Minnie repeatedly to \\"Look up!\\" and promises his protection, but even when everything wonderful falls into her lap, she reverts to fear. She does something that had me aghast. Her actions were SUCH a horrible betrayal! No spoilers, but wow!  Milan did not convince me that Minnie's action was necessary. Minnie is CLEVER. She would have thought of a better way. So I saw Minnie's treacherous act as one of two things: Either it reinforced the huge impact of her childhood savaging, thus confirming the fearful aspect of her character, or it diminished a different key aspect of her character -- her brilliance, her ability to solve problems. But even so, I didn't buy the logic. All Captain Stevens knew was her name. Not her secret shame. So she had TIME to figure out a solution BEFORE Stephens went on attack, and she had RESOURCES. Duh!! Namely the Duke of Clermont, who just happens to think she's wonderful. But on the other hand, Minnie knew that NOTHING she did could actually harm the powerful duke. So, that mitigates things a little.<br /><br />Milan lost points here, not because I didn't like what Minnie did, but because it was not supported by the emerging story line or the character traits already thoroughly attributed to Minnie. Minnie hurt Robert terribly. And suddenly the tone of the book shifted drastically.  (I  may have dumped the book at this point, but Milan had paved the way by creating compassion in me for Minnie..<br /><br />From that point on, the second half of the book (starting at about 60%) was an emotional roller-coaster ride. So many ups and downs. The plots takes several surprising twists -- some are heartbreaking, but others are deeply satisfying, even delightful.<br /><br />♥ For example, there was a glorious honeymoon interlude in Paris. ♥ Kudos to Milan for surprising me again. Just when I thought everything was perfect, she throws a wrench into the first love scene, the wedding night. Nicely handled and it felt authentic. Plus, Milan made up for it the morning after, and on the train, and on the dining room table, and ... (Milan's sex scenes are improving, becoming more emotional, but I would not want her stories to become overwhelmed by sex.)<br /><br />At the very end, Minnie came through in a MAJOR way, and more than once, making up for her earlier betrayal. Robert seemed a little diminished, but I see a HEA for these lovers. I have no doubt Robert will learn how to fight and make up and talk things out. Minnie will teach him. She knows he's gonna make a wonderful husband. ♥<br /><br />(But I'm STILL kinda miffed at Robert, for making Minnie endure what she had to endure. And I'm STILL kinda miffed at Minnie, for her treachery towards Robert.  As I said, an emotional roller coaster.)<br /><br />Minor Flaws:<br /><br />A few typos. Just two. Also, in one section, Milan gets Great Aunt Caro mixed up with Great Aunt Eliza (page 152, location 2777).<br /><br />The characterization of Minnie's father did not make sense to me.<br /><br />Minnie has lived in a village with old ladies since she was 12 years old, but this virgin is wondering how Robert masturbates??  \\"What would he look like when he stroked himself? Would he like long, hard strokes, or soft, gentle ones?\\"<br /><br />Minnie says, \\"If you're any good in bed, I'll...\\"  First, I doubt that phrase was in use back then, and second, even if it was in use, how would Minnie have heard it? It would not be in her vocabulary. Out of character and anachronistic.<br /><br />It seemed that Minnie was quick to forgive her father, but slow to love her two great aunts. She seemed to blame them for her situation, and for the fact that she has shrunk into nothing. She should blame her dad.<br /><br />++++++++++<br /><br />The Next Book and the Prior Book:<br /><br />As mentioned before, Minnie is afraid to hope, but her best friend Lydia continually hopes FOR her. Lydia adds a LOT to the story. She's textured, layered -- not the airhead I first thought -- and fiercely loyal to Minnie. For example, the punch scene, where Lydia slams Captain Stevens for speaking trash about Minnie.  Lydia only let Minnie down once, and for good reasons (but I felt Lydia overreacted).  So...Lydia is the heroine in the next installment, a novella recently published in time for the holidays.  See [[ASIN:B00APONX6Y A Kiss for Midwinter (The Brothers Sinister)]].<br /><br />The Duchess War is the first full-length novel in The Brother's Sinister  trilogy, but a short prequel came out last spring -- and a wonderful little story it was. See [[ASIN:1477589031 The Governess Affair]].<br /><br /> **********nce, her ability to solve problems. But even so, I didn't buy the logic. All Captain Stevens knew was her name.

160774273X|5.0|This book has completely changed my approach to bread making, allowing me to achieve results I have sought for years. I am an experienced home baker but my bread as a result of Flour Water Salt Yeast have been fantastic, far exdeeding my expectations.. It has been educational and fun to read.

B009ZE27US|1.0|this game is stupid it doesn't go under 21 and I'm 11 so ir said I was 46!!!!!!Stupid DONT Get This Game.
B00846REIS|5.0|These Crossfire novels are as addictive as 50 Shades, which means I have read them multiple times with great enjoyment.  I love the characters of Gideon and Eva.  I root for them, feel so bad for them at times, and just want their story to go on and on forever.  I wish I had a new one to read every night.  I can't recommend Bared to You and the others enough.  Please hurry with #3.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I watched this movie on a lark and I was pleasantly surprised!  Good plot and general acting, also contains some top notched special effects.
B000T433CO|3.0|Not too bad, but there are much better holiday movies out there. Some pretty iffy acting by Diaz and Black.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I felt this was a wonderful read. I found this near impossible to put down. The shocking turn of events was staggering.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Cool concept! We heard a few things about this movie, and at first wasn't too sure about Snow White with Huntsmen...especially since the original story had 7 dwarfs!! But this movie was well recreated with a mid evil twist, yet captured glimpses of the classic snow white story. It even kept our 3 year old captivated from beginning to end!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was great read! Full of adventure and very funny! It show important math can be while trying to save your life on Mars. I read it in a day!
B00005LK94|5.0|My whole family loved this move. It is a beautiful move that leaves you feeling happy.  A movie you can watch over and over again.
B0073XV2W2|4.0|This book is scary as you realised this is not at all far fetched. It is not scary in Steven King scary but scary in that you could see the plot line happening. On the bad side I found many of the characters hard to follow as they were not well drawn. The characters that surrounded Odin I found confusing. The one group that were well done was the university group, but they have only a minor part in the book. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it, I have not read any of his other books, yet.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This movie is sooooo much better than the first one. I watched it and new immediately that i had to purchase it. It wont disappoint! Lot of laughs and action in it!
B000YHG72E|5.0|We grew tired of looking for this movie every year on cable, so we decided to add it to our collection. It is one of my 2 or 3 favorite Christmas movies. Only Will Ferrell could pull of a role like that.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|This movie was everything to me!!!! The music is absolutely fierce as well. I have  been watching over and over for about a week.
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|One of the funniest movie i have seen in a long time. Non stop laughs. Great, great movie. Love it!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator works very well the installation was very easy it works just like a hand held calculator I would recommend this app to everyone
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Hilarious, but do not bring your kids! I would not have expected anything less more Seth Macfarlane. May have to watch it again.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I ordered this for a Christmas present. I havent got to watch it yet but have high expectations for it.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I already have this movie and purchased for my granddaughter.  She saw it in 3D and loved it - am sure you will watch this movie many times.  Would recommend it for everybody as is definitely a classic.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I heard such rave reviews but I guess I don't get it. I was bored with the movie. It was a waste of my night.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|enjoyed a lot , fast moving and wow this actor did well in action before seem out of his element, see in action did well
B006WAIV6M|3.0|Far too long and the science wasn't, well, science. I was looking forward to some FMRI's but no such luck. I wou<br />Don't recommend it.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Only okay. Very predictable. A classic love story with a twist and a nice short read. But don't waste your money.
B00008OE4W|5.0|Excellent movie & great service  rrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrr rrrrrr rrrrrrr rrr rrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrr rrrrrrrgggggg ggggggggg ggggggggggg gggg
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I love ken Follett and really enjoyed the first book in the trilogy but I struggled with this one. I would recommend it to those readers who enjoy historical novels and I am looking forward to the next
B008G8SFGO|3.0|the songs are not as easily memorable as their records from yesteryear. But it is a solid offering nevertheless, considering the time these guys have been together
B004Y1USV2|4.0|This CD is amazing. The Yes renews itself with quality, beautiful melodies and without repetition. Of course the lead singer Jon Anderson fouls, but his replacement was done with a more or less similar vocal and good quality. They are quieter songs, showing the maturity of the band over the years and the presence of instruments like guitar Howe, Squire's bass and keyboard in full measure. The title track is one of the best on the disc. Excellent! Note 9.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|Amusing romp through modern philosophy told in a refreshingly &#34;in your face&#34; style. I loved the fact that he didn't' pull any punches  - will you Americans get the reference?
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Always loved their music. A great compilation, great songs and great price.<br />If you like CCR, buy it. You will not be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing you have to get it it gives you lot of games to play I love this game
B005LAII3U|1.0|The Blu-ray freezes on both the theatrical and director's cut.  I was sent a replacement Blu-ray, and got the same result.  This is happening to many people.  Head over to blu-ray.com (which is directly linked to amazon) to see the myriad of posts with people having the same problem.  Firmware on my BD players are current, I also got the same result when I played it on my laptop and desktop.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Really fun read, predictable in certain spots, but overall story was really engaging and kept me turning pages. Interesting take on time travel.
B008DL466C|2.0|Subject matter, flow and delivery are average or below average. Leave the money talk to Rick Ross etc, who have the persona to pull it off.<br /><br />Some really nice beats on the album, wasted on Khalifa.<br /><br />I really like \\"Remember You\\", mostly because of The Weeknd and Wiz has very few bars on the song.<br /><br />Uninspired, boring.
B005721W9O|5.0|One really funny movie for kids and grown-ups alike.<br /><br />Spot-on farce with some memorable one-liners;<br />&#34;This episode was badly written&#34; provides welcome relief on those days when things go really wrong.<br />&#34;Ew, that's wrong...&#34; is often appropriate.<br />&#34;inside-out....and exploded!&#34; always makes the kids laugh.<br /><br />Finally, this movie has forever animated my view of Joshua Tree...
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I enjoy the fact that the movies are true to the books most of the time. Sets are elaborate and with a real effort to stay in the era.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun and relaxing. I play this often. Fun creating dragons.  Very colorful game. Any little girl would love to have this one.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I liked prometheus although it was a bit predictable (I quess that is inevitable in a sequel). It did leave an open ending (once again) that invites one to contemplate... what else?
0688156819|5.0|Great. This is just a waste of words when one word is enough to say what your thinking. That's all.
B005DI6F58|5.0|it is the best one in the sin city series now marv is one of my favorite characters<br />and shows  how he is determined to find the people that killed his one true love
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It's for adolescents...need I say more?  The plot has been used too many times.  The previews used were the best.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Great. One word is plenty to rate anything. Like it or hate it or anything in between can be done with one word.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The dvd arrived very quickly. No problems with playing the dvd. The whole family enjoyed the movie.  I was very satisfied with this purchase.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Ok...this is the last one for today. Great. One word says it all. You should not be required to use and waste words to rate anything.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The attention to detail from director Wes Anderson and the fantastatic cast make this a real gem! The movie really invokes the the feeling of the mid 1960s and although it is is purely a fantasy it is so much fun to watch. Highly reccomended!!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a great app. It reminds me of a fun version of Cityville. The only problem I have with it is that it didn't save my progress after I raised 7 levels. We'll see if it continues to do this.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Having read the reviews I wasn't expecting much, but I was entertained. I don't usually have a problem with violence in movies, but I felt this was a bit excessive because it didn't add to the tension or plot. If like this kind of movie, and I usually do, you'll be entertained. If you are looking for a 'film' this isn't it.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|great plotting and fast paced story line with a twist or two to keep it exciting.  want more books by Mr. Crouch
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Loved it<br />Robert Patinson was great! Great story was just as good as the book.  trust me you won't be disapointed
B004JHY8A8|5.0|Brilliant just could not put it down!!!<br />I stayed up all night to read it.i would recommend it to all
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this os a great game the only thing I dislike is the lag on the guy named alxes reserve that realy fun please exuse. my spelling
0345529057|4.0|you get what you pay for :)<br />I dont have any complains for this. I'm totally satisfied with the quality and finishing of the books. If you're how ever is looking for a collector's item or book with high quality printed material I would not recommend this & better try the paperback version.
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|I saw this a couple of years ago and they are re-releasing it as new for 2012.  Talk about a rip off.  They just change the date of release and sucker people into thinking that it is new.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I've only seen the first two episodes but they have hooked me on seeing the rest.  This was a recommendation from a freind, and when i discovered I could use my Prime membership to get the shows on the laptop I've hooked up to my big screen, I tried them out.  I was pleased that even with a relatively slow DSL line, the show ran beginning to end without any delays, I plan to see the rest of season one over the holidays.
B005HSL626|5.0|You have to get this app.Once you play it you can't stop.I would never turn this app down.It's like chocolate eat one piece and you can't stop.Needless to say you better get this app!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I am hooked on the show but now I have to wait to get the 2nd season. I cant wait to see what happens next..
B0035FQ1UU|3.0|While the graphics were incredible, it was too over the top (flying/driving through falling buildings, outrunning volcanic eruption, etc). But hey, just look at the plot!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I feel like I am at chuck e cheeses. lots of fun. disappointed in amount of coins and suppose to be free.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love bingo but this game is as good as being in person without the smoke and really bitchy old people. I play it every day, between my kindle and face book this is the only bingo game i love.  Everything was explained before I bought it and I have had no problems since.  I recommond this game highly.
B004QSQMKE|1.0|I grew up watching this movie on VHS.  It was magically and captivating to the imagination.  What made this movie resonate so soundly with me wasn't Tom Crusie's boyish good looks or the fairytale fantasies, it was the whimsical fantasy like music that dotted the back drop of this film aka Tangerine Dream. The movie I ordered from your company however changed this completely, robbing the film of its mystery and artistry.  I am writing this complaint because you did not provide notice. The soundtrack to this particular DVD I ordered was not Tangerine Dream. Very disappointed.
159562015X|5.0|My husband received this book and loved it so much that he ordered one for his father for Christmas. It is a great, thorough test to help you figure out where your strengths lie. It's great for ministry (my husband and his father are both pastors), as well as for other organizations who'd like to better utilize their employees.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My 12 year old loves these books even though he has read them from the library he wanted to get them all on his kindle and he rereads them when he doesn't have anew book.
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|WOW! The action and photography was incredible.<br />You could feel the despair and frustration from the characters which made their victories all the sweeter<br /> Caution: VERY GRAPHIC
B003E8P9G0|5.0|my 12 year old has read these 2 or 3 times he wanted to get all the books on his kindle so he would have them he has this book in hard back from Scholastic book fair at school.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Was the perfect final touch for my costume last year. It's a little heavy and will pull on thinner materials. However, the manufacturers help remedy this problem by placing two pins on the back rather than one. This also helps keep the badge straight.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Oldest son found this and downloaded it to his kindle to help monitor its battery life.  He loves this kind of tech stuff.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I dont normally do reviews... everyone says this but I really never do. I read the first book as I have not seen the movie and was totally sucked in. At 1 am in the morning I finished the 1st book and just had to read more. By 2:30 am when my husband told me to go to bed I had already read half of Catching Fire. The book is great. I just finished it and cannot wait to start reading the thrid book!
0937381888|5.0|I really just started brewing about 4-5 months ago and felt I was getting along just fine.  After reading this book I now realize when it comes to brewing I am an idiot  ;) .  I absolutely love the book it is as complicated and as simple as it can be.<br />John has a knack for taking complex issues and breaking them down so even I can understand them.<br />Buy this book for the man in your life to proud to ask for directions  .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thank you Amazon for offering Season 3! I didn't want to wait until next year to remain on the edge of my seat for an hour each episode. Walking Dead (all seasons) is the best show out there. It's about the humans as much as the walking dead zombies. Lots of blood and gore, but that's what happens when zombies take over the country and you have to fend them off at every turn.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Great to have, use it alot.  You will always have a calculator at your finger tips, so that makes it so handy
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Continental Drift was a three for me but I imagine its target audience will enjoy it immensely. Not a full on keeper, but worth a rental.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This is great to add text to your photos, so when people are looking at them they don't have to ask you who they are
B00571F26Y|4.0|I  would say this book is well-worth the money; it introduces some very good, thought-provoking ideas regarding health & nutition that you definitely will not hear from the mainstream medical or fitness community. He makes his point well but, as is typical of any kind of &#34;true believer&#34;, belabors the point a bit. While I don't buy 100% into his recommendations/philosophy, I do believe in about 80% of it.
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary is superb! The translation section at the bottom of every definition page has always been indescribably useful, because of all the contextual examples it provides. I love this dictionary and am glad I can use the app on my new Kindle. I only wish every definition had an etymology section. It is very disappointing that none is provided. :(
B0092QITO2|2.0|The good:<br /><br />The special effects are top notch; however, in this era, any high-budget movie has excellent visual effects, and they are no longer a reason to watch in and of themselves.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />Colin Ferrel can simply not carry a movie; he has failed to do so before, and he fails to do so again. When Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting in the same role is of better quality, you know something has gone horribly wrong. Ferrel is flat, and simply not believable in the role of Douglas Quaid.<br /><br />The neutral:<br /><br />Movie makers have always recycled material from their predecessors, so the current wave of \\"reboots\\" is certainly nothing new. However, in the case of Total Recall, none of the logical reasons for a remake exists. The original is still a movie that does not feel completely dated and is fun to watch. The original audience of the Schwarzenegger version is still very much alive and kicking, and not letting enough time pass between the two versions puts a great deal of pressure on the remake to be much better than its earlier counterpart. It was 43 years between the first two versions of King Kong and 29 more years before the third version showed up. While 22 years may seem like a long time between Total Recall incarnations, the rate at which movie technology has moved during those two decades is much, much slower than at any time before, resulting in a complete lack of wow-factor in the new version.<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />Colin Ferrel's acting is absolutely horrid, and is a significant factor in the movie's failure. The rest of the film is not so horrible, but it stills ends up falling on the low end of mediocrity. The end result? A surprisingly boring experience not just when compared to the original, but even as a standalone work.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|The Bodyguard<br />Sad movie especially after the death of Whitney.<br />Sometimes we need to appreciate the gifts that have been given to us and not take them for granted.<br />Losing her voice might have been her end!
0345803493|5.0|WHY, WHY, WHY OH WHY....if you hate the first book, do you buy the second one!!!! I can understand a one star review on the first book.  Makes no sense. all the one star reviews from people who didn't even like the first one?
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Bought it for my 8 year old grandson, and it's the first thing he does every morning, and the last thing he tells his mom every night he is going to do.  It's brought a lot of pleasure to him.
B006O3MU96|1.0|Visually it looks very nice. The controls, however, make it unplayabe. You have to tilt your device too far to make him move and then it moves too fast an goes flying. Not playable at all.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|excellent machine.  I love it.....easy to charge.  Adeqauate power......power had been the worry.....adequate power for small jobs.  Keep selling Downton ABBey  we love it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I did not find it as exciting as the first book.  The ending was kind of anticlimactic.  I would say read it because it is the second book of the trilogy.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and thought it was very entertaining.  The concept is the same as the first version but everything else is different
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Only a couple typos but loved the story. I never thought I would like a Kindle but a friend got me one and I love it!!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie is a 100% predictable. It's the same story told in a dozen other movie; slacker friends, one has girlfriend who puts up with his slacker life for several years, decides she wants him to change, he wants to change, slacker friend holds him back, they break up, she goes for rich, good looking jerk, slacker friend gets girl back for slacker, blah, blah, blah. This time one of the slacker friends is a teddy bear.<br /><br />The humor, the writing and dialogue is a just an extended family guy episode. And not a very good one. Save your money, if you want some laughs just watch some family guy.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|There were a few typos in the books but nothing that distracted from the whole of the chapters. Great read and love my Kindle!
B009ZE27US|5.0|I hate all the comments saying &quot;a bunch of kids rated this&quot;. I'll admit most kids are stupid but some of us are actually smart enough to know that an app that takes five seconds to download could never be real (there's no comma) let alone any app. So stop pointing the finger at all kids for everything (it's an expression and not referring to the middle finger).
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Only a few typos and I loved the story. I never thought I would like a Kindle but a friend got me one and I love it!!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I thought this was one of the free &#34;Instant Videos that Amazon offers with a Prime membership.  Turns out, the previews were free, but I was charged for the Pilot.  Although it was pretty good, I'm not sure it lives up to all the hype it received.  But afer all, I just saw the pilot episode, so I'm probably not in a position to judge.<br /><br />That being said, I don't think it's worth $2 an episode, but I'd continue with it if it was free.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Can't stop playing it got hook and the first broad love the colors in the game and easy to see
0061733199|3.0|This book is considered by many to be a &#34;bible&#34; of survival books; I just didn't. There was a lot in there that didn't seem to apply to even my &#34;wildest dream&#34; scenarios, and too much stuff that I am almost certain that I would not do. (Yes, I have been in a couple of survival situations).<br />Just don't make it your only survival book.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like this app, it keeps me in tune with what is happening with my friends.  I would recommend to all my friends to try it.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|When we ordered this movie it said that it had a little scratch on the disc. When we received the DVD and watched it everything was fine. The movie was great! No problems. My husband and I have been really happy with the used movies we have bought from Amazon.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book did not have a terribly complex storyline and the characters are a bit one dimensional but for FREE its worth the read!! I finished in like a day so all in all cute and simple.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|But not as many as I had hoped. Funny, inappropriate humor. I wouldn't recommend watching with your kids. Streamed without any problems.
B005OYHF0A|5.0|One of the best books about programing I ever have read. I must if you prefer to call yourself a proffesional programmer that works with big systems.
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|For a long time I was looking for some confirmation on why I was on this planet, and this book was a big reassurance for me.<br /><br />I was told earlier this year I was here to teach and my past lives were on another planet. I resonated with this a lot and reading the descriptions of wise ones and star people in this book pegged me completely. Also, my roommates and sister also found a lot of answers in the descriptions of different Angel realms.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book - very interesting and a super quick read.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|The best parts of the movie are in the trailer. Ok, but not as funny as I hoped it would be.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|Watched it first when I was 3 years old and now I get the same excitement while watching it as an adult.<br /><br />Every kid out there should watch this movie. It is tasteful, clean - a masterpiece that will forever capture Christopher Reeve and the magic of superman.
B00000I41J|5.0|This is Cannonball Adderley and Miles Davis together and this is great jazz.  If you like really good saxophone and haven't listened to Cannonball Adderley then you are missing out.  Cannonball is awesome and this particular album is one of my personal favorites.
B005HV6Y5W|3.0|It came without the slipcover! WHO DOES THAT TO A PERSON???<br />Everything is fantasmical though, and the picture and audio are just orgasmic.
B000F3UAFC|4.0|This movie is just fun to watch.  The dialogue is full of wit and cheek and really delightful.  The scenery (all shot on Amalfie) is breathtaking and makes you want to hop a flight for Italy.
0062075195|5.0|Love Lauren Conrad. Have all her books. They are a must read.Came nicely wrapped and no damage on the books.  CW
141690977X|5.0|I have watched this movie numerous times and I laugh and smile continuously every time.  The love stories in it are wonderfully diverse, ranging from really sweet to making you feel like you are staring in a mirror at some of your own horrible relationship mishaps.  This movie has some of the most pithy lines and some of the most poignant comments about dating and relationships that it is worth watching over and over again.
B0047GNCSU|5.0|I have all her books. They are a must read. Ordered and received them quickly. No damage on the package. Love Lauren Conrad. CLW
B005NQ94KS|3.0|I couldn't bring myself to giving this four stars, but it is a pretty good movie, but not great.  Anne Hathaway is wonderful in it, but if you are looking for an uplifting or inspiring love story, this is probably not what you are looking for.
0316056863|5.0|The first thing that I want to say about this book is that I enjoyed it immensely.  I've been wanting to read it for a while and I was very excited to find it on my brother's bookshelf the other day.  The writing was so sarcastic and funny that I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />I can't say I knew much about Tina Fey before reading Bossypants, besides seeing Mean Girls, the occasional SNL sketch, and some 30 Rock episodes.  But her book made me see her as a really cool person.<br /><br />Her stories from childhood were really funny and endearing, and the pictures scattered throughout the book really made me laugh.  If you like Tina Fey or are interested in comedy and memoirs, then I definitely recommend this book for you.<br /><br />My Rating: 5 stars
B00005614M|4.0|I love Miles Davis and own many of his albums and listen to them all the time.  I  considered giving this one a rating of 3 stars because it is some of his stranger experimental stuff, but you know it is part of the development of what made Miles Davis so great.  I do pull it out occasionally and listen to it, but it is not anything like his truly stellar albums like &#34;Kinda Blue&#34;, &#34;Round About Midnight&#34;, &#34;Milestones,&#34; or &#34;In a Silent Way.&#34;
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|I already played the free version and it didn't save my progress so I had to start all over, now that I have it won't let me click on certain items like the flash light I need for the basement that's located in the office and I also PAID that outrageous 4.99 for the app and now that it refuses to work kinda posses me off  little love the game but I'm highly disappointed at the money I waisted paying for something that no longer works as described
B000002ADT|5.0|I listen to Miles Davis all the time and this is the album I listen to the most.  It is a great album of his blues.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The series is great and I have a nephew who does not have cable and has not seen it so...
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Great fun on the Atrix. Even better on the Transformer! Bigger screen may equal better for best experience, but it's still fun (and maybe more challenging) on the phone.
B0085YNML2|5.0|i installed it today and could not put it down. my 5 year saw the game, stole the tablet out of my hands and played it for hours until the battery ran out!
0805092447|5.0|Great first reader my baby loved it! We have to read it over and over every day. Now she is reading it back after you read it about 5 times
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Story was well written and fun to read. The author keeps you entertained and the ending was perfect for the book.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I read this book after my grandmother said I should read it but after I started I had to finish weeks after I started it. I believe with Jayce that every child needs to live their lives as their should being kids. Being taken and made to live depending on a couple for everything is depressioning. I had leaved with abuse all my childhood so it was hard for me finish once I started reading. I do believe this is a good book that everyone needs to read to understand first hand what some people have to go through to be the strong people they are today.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|What can I say I love this book and it delivers. I love the character of Logen Ninefingers and it is good to see that age hasnt mellowed him a bit. If it wasnt for his insanity he would be someone that is extremely loveable. The whole book reminds me of the saying &#34; as bad as you are there is always someone worse&#34;. Shy, Logen, Bayaz, they all have someone that scares them.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|I always loved this film.<br />I switched to mostly Blu-Rays s.<br />So when I got rid of of most of my DVDs.<br />Ghost happened to be one of them.<br />So when I found out that this film is on BD.<br />I bought one<br />Thanks Paramount for doing another great job.!!!!!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great read! As enchanting as A Wrinkle in Time and as heartwarming as Harry Potter! Can't wait to read the next one!
B008RZHAAS|4.0|I'm a relatively new shadow fan, so I can't really speak of the worth of this as a 'best of' album. However, it kicks ass, track after track. I've been listening to it  almost daily for a few weeks now.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|\\"I believe in music the way some people believe in fairy tales...\\"<br />And if that strikes a chord with you, you'll love this movie.
0374275637|5.0|Great book filled with perspective-widening wisdom, and backed by clear examples and brilliant scholarship. Amazingly easy to read, and actually fabulously entertaining as well as insightful.An absolute must-read.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Bought this as a birthday gift for my son and he could not be more pleased. He loves the minecraft game on his Xbox and really enjoyed assembling this item. Its hard to find, but if you can get one, it is worth it.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|this game is so awesome. i love starwars and angry birds, but both of them together.... pure awesomness. i love you rovio!!!!!!
0679809015|3.0|The book is smaller than I was picturing.  It is cute and it is a book for kids, nothing spectacular
B000FVBLEI|5.0|This album is just simply amazing ATR has put out some great albums but I think this is the best one. I cant even describe how much I love this album.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Based on a true story.... can't get any better! Shia LaBeouf as always delivers a great performance as the rest of the cast.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|most of the time, I dont recommend screen adaptations of books, because they always try (and fail) to make it &#34;better&#34; than the book. This one does not do that - this simply, and truely - visually expresses the book! (well - except that Daenerys has black hair in the book... and in the book Tyrion is wry and sarcastic, and funny... and very honestly expresses many of the physical issues little people have to suffer negotiating space in a big world...) - over all however, if I met someone who does not like to read - I would highly recommend this show.<br />If I met someone who likes to read - but doesn't know if they will enjoy this story - I would highly recommend this (and then encourage them to read the books!) and I'm glad I bought it! Because when the book comes out - I will watch them all again - refresh my memory - and then READ the BOOK!...<br />The books are awesome! and this is a very near representation of the books!
B007M45PMU|3.0|Ho Hey obviously caught the interest of the beer promoter on TV and is the attraction on this album but the other songs good enough to justify a download of the entire album, especially since Amazon offered for $3.99.
B00A2XU9IS|4.0|my child loved this! he woke up every morning asking to open the next window. the first week the sound wasn't working though.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Amazingly and painstakingly researched.  French gives us insight into a time gone by.  A world on the edge of war, an empire crumbling... and the flotsam & jetsam of humanity that ended up in Beijing in the 1930s.  Wonderful & griping, as a reader you get a chance to both immerse yourself in the world of Peking and are in tune with the characters.<br />If you liked Devil in the White City, this is a great follow on.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I bought this DVD from a PBS fundraising presentation and LOVED IT!<br /><br />We  watch it again from time to time and I decided to send a copy to my son, who is a Yanni fan.  I WASN'T a Yanni fan til I saw this performance.  I think it is one of the best performances I have ever seen---and believe me, at my age I have seen A LOT OF PERFORMANCES ---worldwide!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is awesome. don't listen to the negative reviews about not getting it on the kindle fire! its a really awesome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)
B009E9R2OK|2.0|Meh. This just doesn't do it for me. Too much bombast, too little music, too many miles. HD audio wasted.<br />Your mileage may vary.
B009ZE27US|5.0|read the description!!! it says it GUESSES your age. the app doesn't know who you are!!! stop overreacting over a game!!!
B0096PS4Y4|5.0|I own WAY too many copies of this album in various formats, but heard the buzz about this new 180 gram Rhino pressing and decided to give it a shot after weathering the Beatles vinyl wars for the past month. Well, the hype isn't hype. This pressing is well worth the $25 if, like me, you rate Forever Changes near the top. This is the one. Better than my original.<br />Get it!
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Great Product! Season Seven wasn't the great season for Supernatural but contains some great one off episodes!  Would recommend for any Supernatural fan to complete their collection!
B008Y2X78S|5.0|One of the best series out there right now.  I would not have thought to cast Steve Buscemi in this role, but he is perfect!  Expect the unexpected in this series.  Nothing is off limits.
1592536913|5.0|great book - especially as a coffee table book. nice conversation starter. interesting way of categorizing the chapters.  thanks much!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I had heard great things about this series from friends, though not a fan of middle age or &#34;mystical&#34; type series I wasn't sure if I'd really enjoy it.  My husband wanted to watch it so I decided to watch it with him.  We got addicted.  There is a lot of nudity and sex (it's HBO, what did you expect?), and it can be quite distracting when set during a monologue, but the plot line is fantastic and many characters you love to hate!!  When we watched the last episode of this season we had to find out when we could order the next season.  My husband is VERY critical of all entertainment and he also loved this series.  Highly recommend.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|The basic idea for the plot was interesting, but the director took the story down the same old tired path by injecting low level humor into the plot.  I am not certain if this was Mark Wahlberg's first foray into comedy movies, but he should have been more selective on the movies he picks in the future.  There are several funny parts to the movie, the fight in the motel room comes to mind.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Hi-<br />I just bought it, and it says \\"There was an error when downloading Minecraft - Pocket Edition. Please try again later.\\" And I tried again later to the same message! Someone help?<br />EDIT: Changed review to 1-star since I have found no solution yet
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|old familiar characters from prior novels.  well done and well thought out. I recommend this book for a great read
B001706I5I|3.0|I was impressed with the costumes and setting, but the content was not Suess style. The focus was on twisted adult disappointments. Although this is typical for children's shows to be tainted with adult humor and themes it really sends mixed messages. I'm not a fan of it and look for shows that are fun in ways my kids can relate to.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Nice graphics, does not save when deleted. Easy to use, great upgrades. Cost to much t destroy Honda and trees, limited view of maps.
B009ZE27US|1.0|this game looks VERY dumb but what are you gonna do. please bit some fun games on here because I am getting board of these games.I am begging you to put some fun games on here
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|Sorry, I didn't get back to you sooner, with Christmas upon us.  Thoroughly enjoyed the movie, first time I saw it was a very long time ago.
B00A757EFW|4.0|If you love the original Pac Man you will love this app. It plays excellently for hours of fun on end!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|very accurate! love the hourly feature, the weather here in Louisiana is very unpredictable and forever changing. this app is quite useful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love how its exactly like minecraft and not like those stupid ones with shooter or space and all that s*** thank u mojang for mine craft kindle fire and xbox 360 minecraft thanks
B00005JLEU|5.0|My kids love this movie and I could only find it online. When it arrived it came as they said it would. Very happy how quick it came!
B009RX85N0|5.0|There are some big changes in Storybrook in this second season of \\"Once Upon a Time.\\"  With the breaking of the Evil Queen's spell at the end of last season, Storybrook's residents are once again aware of their fairy tale identities.  However, nothing in this dual world of reality and fairy tale is ever simple.  For one thing, no one can leave town.  For another, it isn't easy to get back to the original enchanted land that is home for the characters.  For a third, Regina, the once and future evil queen, just can't seem to go straight, locking horns with Prince Charming, with Mr. Gold, and finally with a long lost relative.<br /><br />There will be excitement and enchantment galore in the second season, as the backstories of yet more characters are revealed, and as characters travel between their two worlds.  Emma and Snow make a dangerous trip back into the land of enchantment, only to be stranded and left in mortal danger. Their journey will give Snow a chance to teach Emma about motherhood and magic.  Along the way, Emma will finally begin to understand that her own powers may extend past her street smarts and pluck.  Her journey, and the viewer's, will be enhanced by meeting THE Captain Hook (who comes with his own complicated backstory) and Jack's bean stalk (and the Giant).  Prince Charming will be acting sheriff in Emma's absence, and face his own challenges, including a missing Henry and the framing of Red for murder.  Regina will struggle to keep a promise to foster son Henry not to use magic, while she and Rumplestiltskin may be compelled, unhappily, to cooperate to face a truly dangerous opponent from their collective past, an opponent who will force life-changing choices on a number of characters.<br /><br />One of the attractions of the show is its creative mixing of fairy tales from any genre.  How else, for example, to explain Ruby (a werewolf in her alternate identity) talking Dr. Victor Von Frankenstein into performing life-saving surgery on an auto accident victim? \\"Once Upon a Time: The Second Season\\" is very highly recommended to its fans, who are likely to enjoy more good storylines and excellent work by a solid ensemble cast.accident victim? \\"Once Upon a Time: The Second Season\\" is very highly recommended to its fans, who are likely to enjoy more good storylines and excellent work by a solid ensemble cast.

B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Laugh and enjoy the caracters, didn't think I would enjoy as much as I did. This is adult comedy not for the litttle ones. Think it will be a hit.

B00AHSINKO|2.0|Save the marriage type movie. They are going to councilling to save their mariage, when all Tommy has to do is make love to his wife and sleep in the same bed? This movie is for Fred Flinstone and Betty, or is it Wilma?

B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Action, violence, and an open ended movie to make another sequeal. No ending, its like a pre-queal of another movie to come.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|The Facebook App is pretty easy to navigate and I really like being able to access it quickly to stay connected.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really love this series. There is something about making readers fall in love with the character so much they have to read it again just because they are not ready to let go of them yet. This series definitely does that. Would love for more sometime down the road.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Jill Taylor had the unique experience of, as a neuroanatomist, observing her own stroke \\"from the inside\\" and recovering from it to tell us about it.  That by itself would recommend reading this book.  But the light, yet thrilling way she tells us her story absolutely turns this book into a \\"must read\\".
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It is one of those books you reread because you are not ready to let go of the characters just yet. I am so happy to hear about the next book that is Travis' POV. Cannot wait to read it. LOVE ME SOME MADDOX!

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet(kindle) but so far it VERY closley follows ths series and as such is very enjoyable. At the conclusion it remains to be seen if it still follows the series. Look forward to the other editions.
B000FA675C|5.0|I finally decided to read this book after I had read Angels and Demons awhile back. I loved that book and appreciated how close the movie all most got to it as well. I definitely wanted to do the same with this book. I ordered it yesterday or the day before and I am all ready done with it because I literally could not put it down. I will be reading the next book in the series real soon.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This was a great film and deserves Oscar consideration.  But it tried to do too much and have too many plotlines.  I always hate it when a likeable character loses in the end through no fault of his own.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Raw authentic action like the previous installments and Bond (Craig).  Classic mix of conspiracy, stealth, craft, and vengeance.  Well-paced so that the new storyline can be established; seamlessly extends the original.  Renner is terrific.  Producer can easily build on this new character and extend the narrative into a series.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|So much better than I expected.  Great commentary on contemporary obsession with reality TV and class warfare.  I can't wait for the sequels.
B008M36EEI|3.0|not very convincing love aspect-relationship, totally far-fetched plot and dreary characters, only watched to end to see how much sillier it could get.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Lots of twists,and turns, not sure who to believe, entertaining and can't put it down in the second half.  Treat your spouse well!
B0083GR6Y6|4.0|I anticipated a movie where I would continually be able to guess the outcome, scene by scene. I was only partially right. There were some surprises and Liam did not fail to deliver. All outdoors in the snow and cold, forests and rivers, so if you're into outdoors adventures, you found it.
B009CPES4I|1.0|The movie was going to be an evening of enjoyment, However the silly thing ran for 5 min and quit.  Could not reload it.  It just never overcame the fact that it would not reload.  Sorry
B009LREA1S|5.0|Great movie, and my 14 year old son has now watched it many times over. Certainly getting our money's worth out of this one! Well done. If you like the Batman series, add this one to your list.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|The Lumineers debut album rides the folk-rock wave currently being popularized by the likes of The Avett Brothers and Mumford and Sons. But unlike either of those two bands, whom I love, The Lumineers eschew polish and production for a defiantly low-fi souns and a great dependence on \\"Ho Hey\\" choruses. To that extreme, their calling card is that title. I hook filled sing-along called simply \\"Ho Hey.\\"<br /><br />The Lumineers are heavily dependent of catchy choruses and chants that a footballer could love. At the same time, they know the pain of loss resonates well in this sort of context, as \\"Stubborn Love\\" exhorts \\"The opposite of love is indifference.\\" This trio can do both the depth and the easy and filter between the two with ease. Lead singer Wesley Schultz holds is own with the Avetts and Mumfords for the rootsy delivery, and can even claim Denver CO as their home.<br /><br />These are the kind of songs that do a barn-stomper proud. made for beer chugging and glass slamming ala \\"Ho Hey\\" and other irresistible choruses. Step back in time with \\"Flapper Girl\\" or Charlie Boy,\\" or get a little deeper with \\"Slow It Down.\\" Get past the hollow sound (like I said, this is a low-fi production) and you'll find a lot to enjoy with The Lumineers.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Enjoyed the concepts and story line.  Good action sequences.  I liked the roles of the characters, especially the beagle puppy.
0756666937|5.0|Bought this book for my grandson who probably has more Lego sets than any other toy.  It is packed with Lego information from inception to the future.  I loved looking at it and I know my grandson will love it as well.  It's a very good book at a very good price.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Does just what I expected it to as easy as I wanted it to be.  I was using another flashlight app on my old phone but put this one on my new HTC dna and think it's awesome.  Thanks so much!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Good to have the first movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly's character Harry Bosch the LA detective is so real to me I feel like I know him as an old friend.  I have read all of the Harry Bosch series and loved each one.  Michael Connnelly is simply the best and I highly recommend any thing he has written.
B007TML4EI|5.0|I gave this game 5 stars because it met all my expectations.  It was fun and easy to learn.  I play it often.

B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is easy to use, but the ads are annoying.  I think if they could limit them then the game would be fun.
B000002O4X|5.0|THIS IS ANOTHER &#34;BEST&#34;, IN MY COLLECTION OF SOUNDTRACTS.GREAT BACKGROUND MUSIC,GREAT FOR A RAINY DAY, OR ANY DAY, WHEN YOU WANT SOMETHING IN THE BACKGROUND, AS YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Looking for those brain boost games?  Well, I think this one will suit your needs.  It is fun, not so fast paced you get lost, but it does keep you on your toes.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Excellent.  Good acting, interesting story line.  Well worth the cost to purchase since I cancelled cable TV a year ago.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I love the way this is set up.  I can now find my files with ease.  This was worth the price of the product.  I have not had any troubles with the product.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but nothing to rave about.  My blu-ray disc had problems - would freeze up every so often.  Wish I would have rented this rather than purchase.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE! You will lose time when you start playing.  Keeps your brain sharp when played regularly.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Enjoyed the first season very much.  Do not purchase if blood and gore are offensive to you.  I suspect it is a fairly accurate representation of the real brutality that served as entertainment over 2000 years ago.  Very well done - acting, sets, costumes, special effects, story line.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This mobile system makes the 8 hour trips fly by. This mobile system is very entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book for a weekend read. Once I started I couldn't put it down. Twist and turns that you keep wondering. Really a good fun read. Even friends who don't like mysteries have enjoyed and if you are a mystery fan it's a must read.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love Tina Fey and was not disappointed in this book.  It is funny and gives a lot of background on her time at SNL.  There is some strong language scattered throughout the book but overall I loved it!
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Who would have thought that Father Penguin would run out of ice for his drink in the North Pole?<br /><br />There's only one solution:  send junior out to get more.<br /><br />That's the premise of \\"Slice Ice\\" -- a game where you help junior to slice ice barges in order to bring them home.<br /><br />The fewer the strokes you make to cut down the barge to about 75% of its size, the higher your score.<br /><br />This is an ingenious game that is both visually stimulating and really, really fun to play.<br /><br />Great idea.  Great game.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|The special effects were over the top, making any movie worth watching in my opinion.  My only dislike was the alien touch that the original had, was removed and rewritten.  Other than that, Great Action, Great Kate!
630587493X|5.0|I actually wanted to rent this movie by streaming, however, not one service (Netflix, iTunes, Blockbuster, etc.) offers it. Amazon is where I found a DVD for sale at a RIDICULOUSLY low price. It actually cost almost as much to ship it! Arrived when expected, in excellent condition.
0439023521|3.0|This is a great series but it gets better at book two but youi need to read this book to get the lay of the series
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is fun to play. I love the touch screen and its so easy to play. Its easier than on the computer.
0439023513|4.0|If you like the Hunger games and catching fire dont stop until you read this one.  You have to know the ending.
B006ZZAMWK|3.0|I won't send this back because it wasn't expensive but now I have to buy a new jewel case because this is a Christmas gift and I won't give it in the cracked and broken condition it arrived in.
0525953728|2.0|The book was ok but boring at times.  I did not like the book but found the details as the news agency's had reported.  It was a waste of time and money
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|For many years I have been enjoying Dylan's music and this is one of his best albums I think.  Refreshingly deep!
0439023491|5.0|This book is a definate read.  Hours of great reading and twist and turns that keep you guessing.<br /> The whole series is great but this one you have to read
034553154X|5.0|For fans of George R.R. Martin, this calendar is far superior to the poorly conceived 2013 calendar for HBO's \\"Game of Thrones.\\" The artwork is above average for one thing and covers wider aspects of the Ice and Fire saga.  Skip the HBO version which features close ups of the show's stars from the first season.  Since season #3 will be shown this spring their calendar is way out of date for the new year.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoyable reading couldnt put the kindle down.  If you enjoy Nicholas Sparks youll love this book.  I would read it again.
0785132619|5.0|the title says it all.  this book is so great that someone stole my copy shortly after I finished reading it!<br />I'm not happy about that, but I know someone is enjoying it somewhere.....
B003KRJNBW|3.0|Too much story left out, too short of a movie, gaps exist.  The producers missed a great ending for the movie, can't imagine anyone in hollywood with that little imagination.  Good entertaiment though and good fantasy.
0385535147|5.0|I think I have read all of Grisham's books. Some are great, some are disappointing. I could not put this one down!

B002VPE1WK|5.0|Awesome and innexpensive :) I would deff. recomend for a begginer into photography. my d300 and my lenses fit perfectly.
0316067598|5.0|Wripping account of special ops insertion, battle and rescue.  Read more than once. Truly enjoyed it. I can't wait for the movie.
B000002OAZ|3.0|Cover collections are never a sure thing, but with the artists enlisted for these tracks I guessed correctly, the CD was worth the cash.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|No buffering problems...a bit expensive though.  The movie was fine but at the end, it feels like he didn't actually do anything...
B0000CDJPQ|3.0|In the transition between different forms of FireWire hardware it is nice to have these small but very useful connectors available. Very handy.
B000WDSZ8E|1.0|Only got to the first 5 minutes of Season 1 and was disappointed to see that fornication was promoted. So turned it off and crossed it off my list.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Awesome movie, even if you are not a fan of comics or superhero movies but like action movies you cant go wrong whit this one
B000HKW7E0|5.0|It is a classic.  Friends quote some of their favorite lines, and soon everyone is laughing and quoting more.  It wouldn't be Christmas without it.
B009MO57H6|1.0|I was a fan on the Resident Evil franchise. However Retribution has marked another low in its shameless quest of squeezing last drops of profit. This is not a new movie. It is clear that bulk of the footage was re-used from whatever footage did not make it into previous movies. Then director went to Moscow to shoot a couple of scenes on subway and here you have Retribution.<br />All previous RE movies were not strong on plot side. But Retribution made no sense whatsoever. In fact, it appears as if director(s) are deliberately testing the limits of what public would consume. It all stops just a tad short of Mila Jovovich literally telling us, the public, that we are stupid to pay for watching this. Granted, we all are well familiar with low-budget SyFy movies, which are pure nonsense. However this is theater production with a quality of a cheap, late night Syfy channel re-run. Save your money for something else.
0062082353|5.0|What a true American, I have enjoyed reading this book and had a few laughs along the way as I could relate with some of the stories.
1419705849|2.0|Not good at all very short and the least funniest of the entire series wouldnt recomend it tu anyone of any age
0525953728|5.0|I could not put this book down for one second, I started reading it and blew right through it. Its understandable there were some details left out of the book but still an amazing read.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good action with a connection with previous bourne movies.  Not really sure I liked the ending.  Will have to watch again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys post-apocalyptic environments.<br /><br />Great story.<br /><br />Read the short story for the free preview and you will become immediately hooked and purchase the series.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Glad I waited until the price dropped to 1.99<br />Good movie for that price, typical Dark Night batman. Some good surprises.
B005ZMTYBY|1.0|What a waste, I could not access this product!  Don't think I will be trying to access movies this way anymore!
B007EDYN36|4.0|Some of the stories I already knew but there was ALOT of shocking stories/info that I did NOT know and I was a huge Kiss fan back in the day.  Good read but only for hard-core Kiss fans.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great ebook to read. Was available at the moment of electronic purchase from my home. Very convenient and easy to take any where.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|Second one was the best then Goldmember.  Wish Myers' could have made a fourth.  Great movies to watch when you need a laugh.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's nice to have the audio along with reading the plans. Very good actors reading. Recommend to all that want to read the bible more.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, it is believable. You never know when something like this can happen, an interesting read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|nice app to play. quick to learn. fun and easy. rec for all ages. great game to play for a few minutes at a time.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|The book is so different from the TV series, but I love them both. Makes you feel horrified that you can like a serial killer so much!
B006YC74E8|5.0|I needed an app to allow the Kindle Fire 7&#34; to take photos and this worked &#34;out of the box.&#34;  So... while I haven't messed with the features, it worked 100% for what I needed.  Why the Kindle doesn't come with a photo editor itself is beyond me.  It appears to only come ready for Skype... but it HAS a camera lens so it might as well come with the ability to take photos... even if you have to take them over your shoulder (lens on front only).  :)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I got the &#34;crack tv&#34;  from someone else, but I think it's appropriate.<br /><br />While this season could be said to be over-laden with plot lines, as well as to contain some scenes of more than questionable taste, I've found it for the most part worthwhile and riveting television.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Notably one of the most depressing books ever. Tries to teach readers to look on the bright side but illuminates on the saddest,is t unfortunate man ever.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Great album, to be recommended to everyone. It sounds perfect, got it was Amazon MP3 for a great price. Love it
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Ive read the story to my children and its interesting and it teaches them a lesson. The Dvd came in good condition and for $3 dollars I cant complain.
B008JOLG7U|5.0|Very good set of songs. As always, was very easy to buy from Amazon MP3 and at a great price
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Definitely her best work since Good Girl Gone Bad and Rated R.<br />Diamonds, Pour It Up, Loveeeeeee Song are my fave tracks.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Saw this on my Tweeter from Amazon books deals. Just re-tweeted the post and they gave me a credit to get a book for $1.99. This will be great reading to add to my collection. I'll be checking for more deals like this.
B000FBJAOG|2.0|Amusing at first but gets repetetive and boring pretty fast. The records of zombie attacks through history is the only thing that makes it even remotely readable.
1423136802|5.0|Saw this whole set of a great serie (I already have it) and decided it'd be perfect as a gift. Came on time and in perfect condition.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I am still learning how to use this app, but I can not believe how easy it is to fine places and get ideas for great trip. I will be using trip advisor a lot.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I enjoyed the movie although I would not classify it as a true sports movie.  Clint was in rare form as a disgruntled and aging dad who did things his way and refused to change.  He reminded me of that uncle that everyone has who you're forced to deal with during the holiday season.  Good humor and a solid story.  I recommend watching!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I am still having trouble making and pinning boards. I still fight with this app when trying to do something, hopefully I will get better. Wish there was instructions I could read.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Christmas Classic!!  Great Quality.  We watch this each year and although it is the same movie the blu ray copy gives it a nice lift.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Not a bad movie. Could have been a little more gore and horror. The storyline was a it far fetched. But all in all it was a good watch.
0375869026|5.0|It's a rare and beautiful feeling when I close a book with a sense of completion. That's what Wonder is: rare and beautiful.<br /><br />The language is simple, at a level that a ten-year-old child can easily read. It suits the book not only because that's how old Auggie' is but also because it lays everything bare to the reader. It isn't hiding anything. All the characters' emotions and actions are laid out for us, from superficial behavior to their innermost thoughts, from their doubts and guilt to their happiness and bliss. After all, it's not easy being around someone with such an obvious disfiguration even if it's someone as sweet as Auggie.<br /><br />Auggie is a funny character. As in he's witty and says the funniest things ever in a matter-of-fact tone. It makes me wish I were his friend, so I can banter around with him. He lacks courage and self-esteem at the beginning of the novel because he knows how bad his facial deformities are. It's to the point that he grows out his bangs because if he can't see people's reactions, then he doesn't feel so bad. At least, that's what he tells himself. In truth, he can guess at what people think about him; he sees the whispers, gestures, and furtive looks. Then he makes friends--real friends that stick up for him--and he's able to open up and show his peers just what a wonderful kid he is. And it's so wonderful to see people grow to accept him.<br /><br />I hadn't expected the multiple perspectives, and it was a wonderful surprise. I was glad to see that Auggie's perspective kep reappearing, but other people whose lives he touches jump in from time to time. And it's a great way to introduce things that we wouldn't have known if only Auggie's perspective was given. There is Summer, who joins him at lunch out of pity and grows to like him as a person. Jack, who first talks to him at the Mr. Tushman's request but also grows to cherish his friendship. Auggie's older sister Via, whose fierce protection over her little brother is something I can relate to. Her boyfriend Justin. Her friend, ex-friend, friend Miranda who loves Auggie as if he were her own brother. Auggie is surrounded by many loving people, and though his deformities make him look like a \\"freak,\\" to quote idiots in the book, he has one of the kindest hearts out there. He makes me feel like I can be a better person.<br /><br />This book really hits home because it makes you wonder what you would do if you went to school with a kid like Auggie. Would you go against the crowd to sit down with him and have a nice chat? Would you jeopardize your 'friendships' with other people to stand up for him or her? It's a lot easier for us when we're older to stay true to ourselves, though it's still not effortless. I don't want to admit this, but the ten-year-old me probably would have stuck with the neutral camp. I wouldn't want to be mean to him, but I wouldn't stand up for him either. Heck, the teenage me may not have had the courage to try to talk to him like a normal person. And that's why it's so horrible.<br /><br />When I think about it, a bully is someone you can stand up to. Someone who ignores your existence is harder to push away because there's nothing there in the first place. I wouldn't want people to treat my existence like the Plague. What we need to remember is that sometimes it's not what we do but what we don't do that really hurts. Auggie wants to be accepted for himself, but there are kids who won't spend more time than necessary with him even if they're neutral and it really hurts him. At the same time, courage is necessary because Auggie needs to make the first step to help people acknowledge that he's a person--and a cool one at that. It takes going to middle school, speaking up to people, and standing up for his friends like they stand up for him.<br /><br />This easily takes the spot of the middle grade book of the year for me. I recommend this for everyone.is something I can relate to. Her boyfriend Justin. Her friend, ex-friend, friend Miranda who loves Auggie as if he were her own brother.

B00AMBH70S|4.0|Haven't seen all the others. But if they compare to this one they would be great movies. I would for sure recommend this movie.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|It is a lot fun, a nice step up from flinging birds. Perfect game to play while waiting in a doctors office or getting an oil change. The puzzles can be challenging, but the hints help move you along, that and the delightful soundtrack make this game piglightfully fun to play.

B004SIP7QC|5.0|Finding neverland is a hard to find movie here in rhe philippines. I cant remember if it was shown here in our country. Being a fan of these 2 great actors, i decided to buy it. NO REGRETS. the copy is very clear and correct subtitles<br />I encourage movie enthusiasts to watch the film. Its so heartwarming, moving and both lead actors gave a great acting!<br />If ever i get to look for hard to find movies, i will check with amazon. They deliver. Though, the freight and custom duties are expensive, i will still order.<br />Amazon, discount pleaseeeeee! Merry christmas!

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|My daughter has become quite infatuated with music from my era (60s, 70s, 90s, etc) to now. I no longer know where any of my cds are (her room). We have very similar tastes and when she started listening to MCR, I must say I was entranced by the lyrics as well as the theatrics and musicality of this band.  I can't wait for her to open this cd on Christmas day. I know she'll be thrilled! But she'd better be careful because this cd might disappear into my room!
B009B4ZEMA|5.0|Love this cd! Christina is back!! The song they could have left off was circles...other than that all really good songs! Quite impressed.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|This is so good, better than many of their older albums. Not as good as Led Zeppelin, but better than Justin Bieber. I wish Them Crooked Vultures would make another album.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|Arrived on time no problems.  We can play continuously back to back episodes for our children. Clean humor for younger kids.

B000NGTJTY|5.0|This film is great. I live in Boston, and this movie does a great job capturing what it's like living here and facing decisions of loyalty between the police and the mob.
B00APUYN0I|2.0|Bad video.  Almost not viewable.<br /><br />Use Netflix or Comcast streaming video instead.<br /><br />And this review system stinks since you have to write a long explanation before you can submit it.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Now there are multiple sources of gravity, making the game more two-dimensional (rather than 1-D like the previous games). Still the same basic approach, but more variety.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Vintage Trouble - The Bomb Shelter Sessions<br /><br />  I had never heard of this band until I saw them perform as an opening act on The Who's Quadrophenia tour.  This band are very much \\"Vintage\\" and play somewhere in the Otis Redding meets Led Zeppelin meets James Brown camp (funk, rock, blues and soul all in one album).  I really dig this album and love the groove these guys get into and think that lead vocalists Ty Taylor has just a GREAT voice !<br /><br />  This is a high energy music and I can see why The Who liked this band as the opening act cause they got us all grooving !<br /><br />  The Bomb Shelter Sessions being a studio album actually captures their energy and raw'ness that I so loved in their \\"live\\" presence.  Vintage trouble fuse together soul and rock that will make your toes wiggle and bring out your air guitar skills!<br /><br />  Pick up this album ......you wont be sorry !
B007HACDLK|5.0|As is expected of Vince Flynn, this latest novel kept me on my toes.  Highly suggested.  If you've not read the others in the series, start at the beginning.
0345803485|5.0|After reading some of the reviews on here.... I do think this is a very good book to read. It may not be the best written book but the story line, in my opinion, it is amazing! It took me a week to read this book because I was so interested in what the ending was going to be like. This is an amazing book and I would recommend anyone reading it that is interested in this kind of book. I have four to five people lined up to read my book and which is out buying it right now. Everyone has their own opinions on books and books they like to read... I normally read horror books or at least something in that area or mystery but this book I think it is very romantic, like I said if you are into it. To me this is an interesting book because there are people out that that does think the same way that Christian Gray thinks... people do look at pleasure that way. If you don't then no, you might not think its interesting but again in my opinion, it is. All who says that it is not... sorry you are wrong. To the author, you did an amazing job on this book! I have bought Fifty Shades Darker today and I am excited to read it and continue the story!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is in reality not really good. But it is very addicting! I am about to purchase the last part now! Lol

B008J1QFLU|5.0|A fantastic collection.  I've never seen anything better.  The sound improvment is fantastic and Blu Ray audio a miracle<br /><br />João Pereira Bastos<br />Lisboa<br />Portugal
B00AA7O22U|4.0|While I really liked the first one, I expected the follow up to be as good or better.  While it had plenty of action, it was, for me, just a little over the top.  I think they tried too hard to outdo themselves and the story line fell short of delivering a great movie.  The cast was great, just a little too many flashbacks to the stars old movies and punch lines.  While watching I kept waiting for it to really get going on a new story line, but it never did.  Hence, my 4 star rating.
0062119044|5.0|This novel centers on Eva who is an American of Armenian descent. Her husband is your all-American stereotype guy (Franklin), but maybe a little more complicated than just caricature. Her son, Kevin, is perhaps born a bad seed. However, Eva's relationship with Kevin is somewhat cold and it's possible that Eva has something to do with Kevin's evil.<br /><br />I'm not giving anything away when I tell you that Kevin goes on a murdering spree in his high school. While this novel does spend a long chapter describing the events at the school, the rest of the novel is about Eva and her attempts to cope with what happened.<br /><br />The entire novel is in the form of letters from Eva to her estranged husband Franklin. In these letters Eva tells of their life together. Eva tells of the life they had as a wealthy couple living in Tribeca, NY, and then their suburban life (still in NY). The first few years are romanticized as she describes their time living in a loft in the city. Then, sort of strangely, they conceive their first child - Kevin. Kevin changes everything and the family moves to the suburbs (I think it's important that Franklin spearheads this move). In the suburbs things grow more sterile and colder. The relationship between Eva (who stays home full time, even though she makes way more money than Franklin) and Kevin, is told in incidents that occurred through the years - Eva tries to remember every important act, or detail, while Kevin was growing up. All of this is from Eva's point of view, but she gives stunningly detailed observations of what she witnessed. For example, what Kevin is capable of is given life in a story involving him and an eczema-skinned girl while still in kindergarten. Along the way, we hear of several frightening stories involving Kevin. I think the idea is to give you an idea of how Kevin became what he would become, but not to offer any definite answers. Basically, you are given the facts (at least from the defendant's words), and you are to try to determine what made Kevin into Kevin.<br /><br />Along the way, Eva and Franklin give birth to a girl. Only this time, Franklin didn't want the girl, and Eva and her hit it off wonderfully.<br /><br />Throughout the story, Eva does not let herself off the hook. In fact, the tone of the novel has the feeling of a confessional. While Franklin is guilty of many faults (mostly being shortsighted in the warnings that Eva explains to him), Eva stills feels at fault for Kevin's actions. Eva includes the fact that when Kevin was born, she didn't feel any different than before he was born (no sudden enlightenment of love for this newly born life). In a way, she felt apathetic towards Kevin - and the book itself kind of glides along this theme as Eva's political feeling seems to flow apathetic. Franklin contrasts her with some 50's style American ideal that one associates with \\"Leave it to Beaver\\".<br /><br />The end of the novel ties up all the strings, and does its best to answer why Kevin committed the murders. If also offers kind of a weird hope, I suppose.<br /><br />The writing is very good. At first, I thought the author's writing was a little on the snooty side, but I quickly got used to that. Her perception is quite strong. She's able to convey layers of insight into the ways people talk, or look at each other, their body movements. I think that through the character of Eva, the author was able to give us a pretty reliable narrator (I believe she tried to reiterate this through external witnesses).<br /><br />To me, the only drawback was the character of Franklin, but this is a tough one. He's presented as this guy who wants nothing more than a \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" lifestyle, even if that means that his wife (who makes way more than him) has to stay home to raise their child. It's clear that Eva would have preferred to keep working, but that just wasn't in Franklin's fantasy. There's probably something to Franklin, as a character, representing that \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" utopia that American's might want to believe - I'm sure he represents such a state of mind. Most damning, Franklin does not want to put in the hard work with Kevin - he only comments on Eva's efforts. In the end, Franklin's world comes crashing down.  All in all, I'm not sure if Franklin is simply caricature or representative of some idealized view that many Americans must have.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very good book. The observations made by the author are very detailed and thought-provoking. I'm sure there's a lot of political allegory in this book, but I can't quite pinpoint what. Her word selection and writing is excellent - it's clear she's a professional author. I wish I could give the book 4.5 stars, but Amazon only allows whole numbers, so I rounded up.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is the sweetest book . Funny. heartwarming. Loved the ending. Highly recommended especially to dog lovers. You'll love it
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|love it got the update.  For winter wonderham.If I if I didn't I would've. faint still a really good app for you.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I wanted to read this because I saw the movie first, then I saw the Broadway show and finally decided that I should read the book as there were differences between the movie and the show. The book is wonderful. Highly recommmend
B009HELT3C|4.0|The website had bad connection error with my blueray dvd player unable to watch the movie. but did not know that I had to shut off my firewall on my dsl modem.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Had seen the movie in the theater but wanted to own since I have the complete set so far....no problems-fast delivery and good service. 5 stars
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Always looked forward to the Bourne movies.  Renner spent too much time looking pensive for my tastes.  Just didn't enjoy it as much as the past.  Too bad too, I think this could've been an American version of a long running James Bond.
B000SEI618|4.0|I enjoyed the masterful writing, good humor, and exquisite character descriptions. However, I kept waiting for a story to develop and, in the end was not satisfied.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|It is encouraging, exciting and brings joy to the family when watching.  My 7-year-old says, &#34;It's so amazing because the children don't know how to sing, but then they do thanks to Maria!&#34;
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|From Disney and visionary director Tim Burton (Batman, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Dark Shadows, Alice in Wonderland) comes his stop motion animated remake of Frankenweenie about a boy who loses his dog that is brought back from the dead with crazy things happening. I wish that it would had made more money at the box office that is critically acclaimed and not too much for younger children despite the black and white and the dark subject matter which is becoming somehow the big best animated feature film Oscar contender that its time that Tim Burton gets a Oscar, but if he doesn't get it he might never get the chance to get nominated ever again not even his live action work not getting the chance of being nod for best picture and director and i'm referring to Ed Wood and Big Fish but despite Paranorman and Wreck It Ralph gaining that now Frankenweenie is his best chance of winning him an long overdue Oscar. See this underseen film that stop motion is a niche for animation just like anime that only many see these movies once in a while on blu ray and dvd.
B009AMABH6|2.0|I thought the novel was good but predominantly boring when I read it years ago but when I went to see the film, after watching the trailer, I came to the conclusion that it's even more boring. The performances, especially Robert Pattinson's was great but David Cronenberg wrote the script in a way that made me not give a s*** to whatever would happen to the main character, Eric packer.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Julianne does a great job and the movie has great songs. Wasn't impressed with Tom Cruise's character or singing. Decent movie .
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this romantic novel. It was an easy read and it kept my attention. I could not put it down until I knew what happen.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is really great, the only thing I don't like is that everything's along of money and when you wait for you money it takes like 6 hours so you just sit there XD but besides that it's a really awesome game I recommend this game to everyone!! :)<br /><br />  -Matt
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Muddled mess.  Incredible visuals.  Dumb, inconsistent storyline.  Well acted.  Completely unnecessary movie, particularly when one considers the millions of things they could have do w an Alien prequel. They're making another. Doubt I'll see it.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I loved this book so much, as soon as I was done, I bought the next book! I have read the entire 6 book series and just had to buy the books for my kindle! One day, I was in a bookstore and I saw the Alchemist on the teens bestseller shelf. I went to the local library and checked it out. I COULD NOT put the book down for the life of me!!! I fell in love with the books and hope that when I'm a writer, I will be as skilled as this!!!!!!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|4.5 stars.  Making the 23rd James Bond movie is no enviable task.  Make it in the traditional way and it looks like retread and parody, like Brosnan's last two.  Depart from the traditional and it's not really a James Bond movie, like Quantum of Solace.  This is a series that has had to be remade several times to fit in with the era and to make Bond's exploits interesting.  Skyfall isn't so much a remake as it a back to basics.  Much of it has an old-school feel to it.  Q & Moneypenny are reintroduced and a new M is introduced.  The Bond villain isn't part of some absurd global criminal organization.  He's just a cackling madman From the Connery/Moore days played perfectly by Javier Bardem.  Bardem is the best Bond villain since Sean Bean in Goldeneye.  Craig's Bond isn't some tortured antihero.  He's a professional killer w a smart mouth.  The beauty of James Bond movies used to be how they were pure escapism.  Bond's psychology wasn't explored, much less considered.  He was more of a cypher through which the viewer could live his or her fantasies of jet-setting and saving the world.  The eternal sunshine of 007's spotless mind.  Skyfall edges closer to that.  We get some personal stuff but not nearly the tortured angst of the last two entries.  Skyfall runs well over two hours but doesn't feel too long like most movies do these days.  There's no Bond girl this time around and that is disappointing.  Bond movies tend to work best when there's an element of sexiness to them.  Some of the plot and action sequences are obviously borrowed from other movies like Batman and Die Hard.  Bond works best when he's setting the pace and not keeping up.  Other franchises should imitating Bond.  Judi Dench was always pressing for more screentime and here she gets to be the focus of the entire movie.  Fortunately, she is an excellent actress, so I didn't mind too much.  I like Craig as Bond.  He's a talented actor, so that gives the brain trust a flexibility most of his predecessors didn't.  I'm heartened by the changes they made.  Exactly the kick in the pants this often moribund franchise needed.  I'm looking forward to Bond 24.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|The acting in this movie is so intense, I sat on the edge of my seat for 2&1/2 hours trying not to blink.  Please offer captioning so we can read along!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Surprisingly dull.  Boring villians. Hathaway is a good Catwoman but is in the wrong movie.  Same thing happened to Miichelle Pfeiffer.  Caine is good.  Freeman is unnecessary. Bane is just an obligatory bad guy.  Bale is too arrogant and smug to play psychologically tortured.  Bruce Wayne is boring after awhile.  Dull action scenes.  Prison scenes go on forever. Movie overrelies on mood music. Certainly room for a 4th installment.  Or maybe another reboot.  There will be more Batman movies.  Maybe they won't be pretentious and dull like this one.
B007N31YYI|5.0|Of course this is an all time classic movie.  You won't stop laughing.  I would recommend the entire series of Amercian Pie movies.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Very impressed with every song on this CD. You won't be disappointed. I am now anxiously awaiting the day she comes to a venue near me to attend a live concert.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This is a great movie.  I watch it over and over.  The story is a great one, which ended up changing our world as we knew it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|There is nothing too fancy about this calculator, but that's ok. I like it and it does what you expect of a basic calculator.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Wife and I had a lot of fun watching this movie...not a perfect one but lots of with Tommy & Meryl
0439023491|5.0|This book was fabulous. It came quickly and in great condition. I passed it on to a friend and they thought it had been new
B005LAIHY0|2.0|I am a huge scifi fan and I watched a lot of movies but this one is the worst. I saw it twice (one time in the cinema and now again - I wasn't myself at the second time). The movie has great visuals and the most actors played well (Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbinder,...) but the script and the story of this movie are crap. I can't believe that Ridley Scott is responsbile for it. The same director of movies like Gladiator, Alien and Black Hawk Down.    The theory of ancient aliens (I don't mind) mixed with modern creationism (bulls***) are the concept for this movie. Furthermore the script of this movie is science hostile. All the scientists on board of the Prometheus act stupid or say stupid things. The only survivor - of course - a believer.    In addition this movie don't fit to the other Alien parts and you have not a complete storyline. If you saw the other Alien movies you have after this part more open questions than before.    Therefore don't waste your time and money to buy this product.
1476719071|5.0|OMG Gifted one and she loved it. Also love love love mine! This is for keeping nice and my e copy and paper back are for reading over and over and over!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love this app. The controls are super easy, and it even has the fly mode! I have been playing minecraft since i was 10 (i am 13 now) and it is still very fun. I would really recommend it to people of any age. On the kindle fire, there is no lag whatsoever. No glitches, either. Well, not that i have noticed, at least. GET THIS APP! Totally worth the money!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|very very addictive love the different levels and stages payed other games like this one but none tops this one. great game will recommend.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This is one of the most interesting and challenging Mahjong app's I have tried.  I love Mahjong and am really glad I found this app.  I read some of the comments/complaints and the problems must have been fixed because I have had no problems using the app at all.  Thanks.  Nina
B008XG1X18|2.0|Although friends have said this is good and fun on smart phones, I couldn't get it to load on the kindle fire, possibly because I didn't want to access through facebook. Deleted app almost immediately.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Loved what I played before and wouldn't expect any less from this game - I'll keep playing as long as I can.  A bit addicting, I have trouble turning it off and getting things done that I'm supposed to be doing!!  LOL
B0060D123K|5.0|Awesome movie!<br /><br />Count on the Muppets to take a classic take and give it that ever-so-gentle twist that allows Gonzo to narrate, Rats to be accountants, and Miss Piggy to be Mrs. Cratchett.<br /><br />Michael Caine does, as you would expect, an outstanding job as Scrooge.  He completely loses himself in the acting and there's none of the &#34;Gee, I'm doing this with Muppets&#34; feel you get with other actors in other Muppet movies.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|Not what I was expecting at all but was great!! I recommend it to anybody who likes action or scifi movies.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the best game you could have, when you are on the road... I just love this game I am 3/4 of the way done.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|It's like working with Microsoft Office. I am able to save and view files easily. I would recommmend this to Kindle owners
B001G50SLE|5.0|This is a great show! I started watching it in re-runs and got hooked. I bought seasons 1-3 to get up to speed. I love the brothers and their relationship. I also like the way the writers bring in urban myths. They had me researching blues man Robert Johnson.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great fun. Hooked me immediately. Love the sounds. Looking forward to catching up with 5-year-old great-grandson, if he lets me!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is amazing! And totally worth the price. But when you hear him whispering in your ear... don't look.
B001QXZ81G|5.0|Even though \\"Region 2\\" meant this Electric Dreams DVD couldn't play by default in either my DVD player or using Windows Media Player on my computer (all purchased in the U.S.), VLC media player from videolan.org played this Electric Dreams DVD on my computer with no issues (Media / Open Disc...).<br /><br />With a little extra work, I was also able to get VLC media player to convert the DVD to an unencrypted media file (Media / Convert/Save... / Disc tab).  NOTE: I just created a new profile with the \\"MPEG-TS\\" selected on the Encapsulation tab, \\"Video\\" & \\"Keep original video track\\" checked under the Video tab, and \\"Audio\\" & \\"Keep original audio track\\" checked under the Audio tab.  I named the file with a \\".ts\\" extension.<br /><br />After VLC media player produced that \\".ts\\" media file, I then used ffmpeg from ffmpeg.org to convert that media file to an audio and video format that was more useful to me (i.e. H.264 video and 2 channel AAC audio in a MP4 container for my smart phone):<br /><br />ffmpeg -i \\"input media file.ts\\" -ac 2 \\"output media file.mp4\\"<br /><br />Note: The \\".mp4\\" extension on the output media file ensures that you get all the other default MP4 settings.<br /><br />Of course, if you grew up during the 80s and do any programming, then Electric Dreams is too much fun!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow pretty much sum's this book up for me.<br />So much going on I actually lost sleep over it!<br />(I should have just stayed up and finished it)<br />Author Colleen Hoover really thought of everything even down to the name of the book \\"Hopeless\\" which really was clever. This emotional ride is heart wrenching and warming at the same time. Horrible acts happened but the bond between two people only got stronger as all the secrets came out. There were parts of the book that I was thinking what the hell was Holder<br />doing but as their story progressed everything made sense. A lot going on in this book a page turn all the way through.<br />No raunchy sex so some tender love making.<br />My heart was full of love with this one.<br /><br />Quotes:<br /><br />\\"I went from wanting to lick his dimples to wanting to get the hell away form him.\\"<br /><br />\\"My body is a damn traitor.\\"<br /><br />\\"I expect one of them to at least ask Six why she attacked me, but they don't. This just goes to show how much they love her. They wouldn't even care if she beat me up, they'd tell me<br />I probably deserved it.\\"<br /><br />Check out my blog iloveladyporn.com for more reviews and giveaways!
B004LWZW2E|3.0|The best thing about this movie is just that!  It's filmed like a real major movie and NOT all that Blair Witch project- home filmed camcorder crap! That's the plus side to this movie. This movie is ok for those who enjoy this type of movie.  The first (3)three quarters of this movie was very good, I must say. The acting, sets, wardrobe, lighting, scripts, where all very good. The realism and special effects were impressive. The ending of the movie was very good as well. There are some scenes that were a little dry, that could have been cut from the movie, but overall...this movie was very entertaining , and just about damn good accept for that (1) one area late in the movie, I just did not like. This movie would have made my (5) star rating...but it fell short of that. Overall, I recommend purchase on Blue Ray. I own a copy, and yes, I would watch it again. This movie will (work) on your mind. It freaked me out, all through the movie. So get it...its ok.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book. Loved the focus on strategy throughout the main character's life. Story drew me in very quickly, and I couldn't put the book down.
B000YABS8E|5.0|It's a riot. One of Brendan's bets efforts. I have liked most of his movies. Can't wait for his next.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie was the worst we have ever seen. My wife and I felt that to use a teddy bear which generally represents love and cuddling, sends the wrong message to our children or whomever may end up seeing this crap. The cursing, the sex,the drugs, and story line...all garbage. There are some movies that may not be \\"G\\" rated that express opinions or views that are not so repulsive.<br /><br />We hope that Seth McFarlane will become more creative to consider his audiences and also hope those that find this entertaining will see this as nothing but what it is...junk. Seems that somehow we have become desensitized.<br /><br />At a time when our youth need guidance, lets give them a helping hand. Let them know you can have a good time without being profane or distasteful.<br /><br />Finally, we did not finish the movie and was angry that we were unable to get our money back (not the money, the principle).<br /><br />DN
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|I'm not sure what the big fuss was about this movie.  It is a reasonable story, basically a remake of the 1975 film Rollerball but with a pretty teenager girl instead of the James Caan adult character.  It is refreshing to see an actress like Jennifer Lawrence get to a leading roll, shows that you don't have to sell raw sexuality to get to the screen.  I understand the series of books upon which this movie was based was excellent and it is always hard to transfer books to the screen, but what does get transferred seems to me to be a series of events without any real new or refreshing underlying theme.  The presentation of the hypocracy and moral decay of a potential future all-powerful state is a theme that has been pretty well worked over the years and would really need something new added to make it interesting.  The story also ends on a hanging note, intended solely I suspect to form the connection to the inevitable sequels that will come.  Do yourself a favor and read the books, skip this celluloid translation of the story.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This seems an offering for young working women or those who are lacking self confidence and/or life experience.  The author is seemingly of the opinion that the heroine (& apparently many others) need bondage in order to enjoy sex.  It does sound rather mid-Victorian these days.  Why a young woman can't succeed in business & bed without being held &#34;hostage&#34; by a domineering man is beyond me.  Sounds like &#34;pie in the sky&#34; and a simplistic approach to maturity.  Not for my granddaughter!
B00APUYN0I|2.0|You have to wonder why someone as talented as Anna Kendrick makes this kind of movie.  I suppose it pays the bills.  You can watch the first ten minutes of it to be able to perfectly predict the plot line, then skip to the last fifteen minutes to hear some nice singing.  In between is useless drama and silly writing and almost never a complete song.  But don't waste your money on this one, it will be out on the free movie circuit soon enough.
B007THA4FI|5.0|JK Rowling surprises by focusing on small town life & all the many human foibles inherent in a town divided by class &#34;warfare.&#34;  Not easy adjusting to English idioms & speech patterns, but the author apparently has the inside track on the welfare society she had experienced on a personal level in her own life.  No matter, we can still see our own families & social circle in the various characters she explores with much insight.  A definite must read.
B0000062Y2|5.0|Jesus Christ, Superstar is amazing!  It is timeless! I love the music and the story! So happy to now own it!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The book is certainly something that is far removed from any particular genre.  The writing is good, with descriptions which fit the time and place well.  The tale itself requires such a complete suspension of reality that one must be in the mood to perform that task adroitly.  I won't see the movie!
B0089XH38M|5.0|As soon as I found out there was malware for Android I installed AVG. I do avoid the odder sites, but I have not had a problem so far. I also have it set to scan before an installation.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this is an easy read. wishing it wouldn't end. but is only for adult eyes and minds to read. opens your options
B007EECSFA|5.0|The story begins with 16 year old Laurel witnessing a traumatic event involving her mother. The chapters alternate between the past and present day giving the reader tantalizing clues.. As an adult, Laurel searches for the secret her mother has kept about that long ago event. All of the characters come to life with great clarity. It is a hard book to put down and the end is amazing. I love this book.
0689835604|5.0|Our baby loves this and it has been fun to watch him grow from just looking at the book to trying to lift the flap when we start to ask, &#34;Where is baby's...&#34;.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|There are a lot of items than you have to purchase with a credit card. My kids don't quite understand that some things you can buy with coins and most of the other things you can't. (ages 3 and 5)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow, hurrry and get out of this so I can order the next one!  This was something I had to force myself to put down.
B0054U56B4|5.0|This book is a very good read. Keeps wanting to turn the page. Very well written. Can't wait to finish the series.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|not bad takes a while to really get things going, but fun after a while.  graphic aren't overly complicated which makes for easy play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! My opinion it is better than temple run BUT in some way it is worse. For example, in Temple Run the prices for characters are reasonable but in Subway Surfers the prices for the boards and characters are ridiculous. The only way you could get a really cool character is if you win the jackpot every time or you buy double coins with money which is reasonable. Still Subway Surfers is an awesome game and Kiloo&amp;Sybo developed this game very well. Hope you make new games!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Good movie entertaining! Don't expect the original, this a whole new twist on the original. Personally, I liked this movie a lot, I took it for face value, not expecting a whole lot.

B0086700CM|3.0|its fun.... but not THAT fun. The concept is just run and run and try not to fun into stuff. Not too fun but I still like it. You can get it if you want it! Its a very decent game its just not the best ok? There is a better that is like this one that is more fun! Its called Super Penguins go look for it. Hope this helped!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Very very good I love it I would read it over and over again.  Soooooooooooo great would recommend it most definitely
B000002LSV|5.0|This has to be one of their best collections!  I play it over and over because it has all of their best songs.  Also, there's not one bad song on the whole CD.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I really love this book and I love the twist ending I did not expect that coming a have to read book
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love all of Rod Stewart's music and I just had to have this one because after all his years of producing songs, this is his first Christmas CD.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Cvfgc g g g v b b v g g g v v y y g. Going g g. Gg g
B000002O51|5.0|This is the other Boston CD my brother has been looking for.  I bought this one to surprise him for Christmas.  Another great buy for the songs and price.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Even before I bought an Android phone I was reading about apps and EVERNOTE was on all the lists of must haves. I have been using it for over 2 years and love it. I have managed to clean out my GEORGE size wallet. I have notebooks for TRAVEL with all my info at hand. I have a notebook for Churches that we attend when we travel so I know the Mass times. Other notebooks are WORK, GEOCACHING, BIBLE, COMPUTER, RECIPES, HOUSE, where I have all the manuals for stuff I use around the house. I even have one for little drawings and notes my grand daughters make.<br /> I find a new use almost every day. I just bought the PRO version just to show my appreciation to the app builder but the free version is really all I need.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I bought this for another brother for Christmas because he loves King Arthur type movies and he'll really love this series!  This was an excellent value for everything you get.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Love it because it was so funny and it had great actors in it like Woody Harrison in it. If you love zombie movies. You have to watch this one.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This CD brings back memories of the past.  It's very nostalgic when I listen to it and, again, another CD that doesn't have one bad song on it.  This was a great buy!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Main character not as strong.<br />Plot does not flow as smoothly. Too many inconsistencies.<br />Good action ---  if not a little improbable at times.
B0054YHB8Q|5.0|My brother loves Boston but hasn't been able to find this particular CD.  This will be a great surprise for him on his birthday!
1449410243|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend who is as cat crazy as I am dog crazy. I couldn't resist sneaking a peek through it though. It was funny, and from my memories of brief cat servitude, spot on! I hope they have more coming!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Again, this was bought to go with the other movies in this series.  My brother will be surprised to get the whole collection.
B002WR791W|5.0|I would only give it four stars, but I can't think of any reason to do that. I only wish the film industry could do this kind of work more often. Then I would watch more movies.<br /><br />The production values are superb, including things like trying to light up a series of caves, scripting which makes events plausable and coherent and story-like (a beginning, middle and end), acting, cinematography, etc.<br /><br />The story has pathos, and you care about the characters, their situations and the outcomes.<br /><br />Director Eastwood meant to pair this movie with another he did, \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" which was the same saga told from the side of the American marines landing and taking Iwo Jima during WWII. This one is told from the point of view of the Japanese Army. Some of the scenes from one movie are replayed in the second movie so that a context is given for the scene in the first movie, told from the other side of the two stories. That works well and gives us a profound understanding of the motivations, emotions and sociology of the Iwo Jima battle. History does not repeat, it is said, but it does rhyme. There are lessons to be learned here about conflict at the human level, about the differences in culture and the similarities between the Japanese and the Americans (for instance, the roles of honor and pragmatism, about military culture, etc.).<br /><br />It didn't make much money, and I am sad about that. It is frustrating to me that dregs of movies get plenty of play, but great movies can hardly make a splash. Clint Eastwood is a great filmmaker and this movie shows it.
B00006EXDM|5.0|My brother likes all kinds of music but his favorite is rock and roll.  This is an excellent buy for the number of songs you get for the price.
B002PEP4SC|1.0|I have watched the Castle series for some time and realized that the plot was thin but it held my interest mainly due to Castle's mother and daughter.  When I started reading this book, it became immediately apparent how weak the storyline is.  Nevertheless, I gave it my best effort and read the first 6 chapters.  It did not improve...in fact, for me it became more and more disinteresting.  I finally gave up and deleted it from my Kindle without finishing it.  I would not recommend this to anyone, even those who &#34;love&#34; the Castle TV series.  You will be disappointed.
055338466X|5.0|My nephew is a huge Stephen Hawking fan so this book was a fabulous find.  I thought the price was great and the book an appropriate size for the price.
B009MF56GC|1.0|Even if this only cost a dollar, it would be 100 times too much.  This plotless, worthless, effort by a bunch of old buffoons trying to bleed the public for money is a pathetic, uninteresting, waste of time.  Truly dismal and it irritates me beyond belief that these clowns think so little of their (now former) fan base that they would do this movie just for some more bucks.  I guess Arnold needs the money to pay for his love child--why the rest of them chose to debase themselves is beyond me.
B003PIUC02|5.0|My other brother will be ecstatic to see that I bought him the whole Spartacus collection.  He'll be glued to his television for quite some time because he'll want to watch the whole series at once.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Tender content for loving people.  Timeless content of CD, worth watching over and over and over again. Like the way it is packaged.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I have this CD in my collection and it's an awesome CD.  So, I bought this for my brother's collection too because we like a lot of the same bands.  He'll love this one!
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|This is a very nice unsung film.  The very unusual plot and characters draw your attention.  After seeing it, we were amazed that it had not received more acclaim.
B00008BXJG|5.0|My brother is such a fan of AC/DC and this CD was one of their most popular.  My brother will be excited to have this in his collection.
B00138GZAC|5.0|Classy, jazzy, smooth and engaging is how describe this album.  It get's my husband in the mood and I reap the benefits.
B000000XB9|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite bands!  I used to have all of their albumns and am happy to now replacew the albums with CD's so I can listen to them anytime, anywhere.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a great game !you get your own village ,animals,and habitats:)  you can Evan  catch eggs ! That isn't Evan the best part ,I love facing all the new challenges !
B0041CGOZS|5.0|This is another great purchase.  Again, the best of their greatest songs all on one CD and not one bad song on the whole CD.

B002PMV9FG|5.0|Director David Yates takes us through Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) pivotal sixth year at Hogwarts, where we see him growing still closer to his final confrontation with the Dark Wizard (Ralph Fiennes), who would quite faciley harm a guy in glasses.<br />  Still reeling from the aftermath of the Battle of the Ministry of Magic, Hary hasn't spent much time at his relatives' residence in Little Whinging, but has spent much of the summer riding trains to keep his mind off of things.<br />  At one point, as he is reading his wizarding world newspaper in a Muggle diner in Little Whinging, he enters into a flirtation with a pretty waitress(Elarica Gallander) who takes an interest in the contents of his newspaper.But a promising date with the young lady is aborted by the unexpected arrival of Dumbledore(Michael Gambon), who escorts Harry to the residence of Professor Horace Slughorn(Jim Broadbent) who is hiding from Voldemort and the Death Eaters. This professor, like many, knew Harry's parents, and Dumbledore wishes to have him reinstated at Hogwarts, as his presence there is essential to the defeat of Voldemort. Slughorn, who remembers Harry mother, Lily(Geraldine Sommerville), his former student, with a particular fondness, agrees to do so.<br /> Spending time with the Weasleys at their home, The Burrow before returning to school, Harry and his best friends, Ron(Rupert Grint)and Hermione(Emma Watson), enjoy each other's company, having a laugh over a wisecrack about Dumbledore's supposed age as they gather round an indoor fire burning from a magically suspended wad of newspaper, in what will be an ironic moment.<br /> As they leave the new joke shop run by Ron's brothers, twins Fred and George(James and Oliver Phelps), the three friends notice Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton)and his mother, Narcissa( Helen McCrory) going into Borgin and Burkes wandshop in the seedy Knockturn Alley, where they associate with Death Eaters. Voldemort has chosen Draco for a secret mission as the Dark Lord's grip on the wizarding and Muggle worlds tightens. Making an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa a Bellatrix Lestrande's (Helena Bonham Carter) behest, Severus Snape( Alan Rickman) promises to shield Draco and accept the assignment if Draco fails to carry it out.<br />  Amid torment from Draco on the Hogwarts Express, Luna Lovegood(Evanna Lynch)rescues Harry.<br />  Once back on campus, Professor McGonnagal(Maggie Smith) urges Harry and Ron to take Slughorn's Potions class at the last moment, resulting in their having to borrow textbooks for the course, since they don't have their own. The phrase \\"Half- Blood Prince\\" is on the flypage of Harry's textbook, which features additional information ennabling him to excel in the class, even besting the brilliant Hermione.<br /> In the meantime, Ron, the new Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team wins a game because Harry psychs him into believing he has been given the potion, Liquid Luck.<br /> The new sports hero celebrates his new status as well as his budding romance with the ditzy Lavender Brown(Jessie Cave). Hermione is reviled and hurt by this,  turning to Harry for consolation as he admits his own feelings for Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright), who is currently dating his roomate, Dean Thomas(Alfie Enoch).<br />  Among the mysteries Harry and company will deal with besides that of the riddle of the Half-Blood Prince will be the mystery of what Slughorn knows about Voldemort's rise to power,and the curious possesion of student Katie Bell (Georgian Leonidas) after she is exposed to a beautiful necklance in a jewel case outside of Hogsmeade, and the question McGonagall broaches to him, Ron, and Hermione:\\"Why is it that when something happens, it is always you three?\\"<br />  This film will also reveal the loss of one of gamekeeper Hagrid's (Robbie Coltrane) cherished companions,and Harry's use of that opportunity to get Slughorn to reveal the truth about Voldemort's rise to power, as well as Harry's growing relationship with the Weasleys and Professor Lupin's(David Thewlis) and Tonks(Natalia Tena)amid the destruction of the Weasley's home by Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback(Dave Legano).<br />  Soon, the young James Bond of the Wizarding World will lose his staunchest champion amid a touching tribute led by McGonagall, in which the light of the wands of Hogwarts will drive the Dark Mark from the sky,hopefully symbolic of a favorable outcome for the forces of good in the not-too-distant future.

B007U4DIM6|5.0|I purchased this for my niece and she loved it!! She watched right away and told me it was great!
B001AQO446|5.0|This movie is an amazing classic and is worth your time on you big fancy TV. It has lots of rewatch value and is amazingly amusing.<br />There's outlaws, police chases, screwing people over, misunderstandings, and a mission from god. There's also guns and girls and dancing, what more can you want out of a movie?
B000RZIGVS|5.0|I bought this for my father as a x-mas gift and he loves it.  He is amazed the whole show is available in this box set.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|We nerds/geeks will enjoy reading how we got there, our unappreciated talents and how our society suffers from a Culture of Personality.  A great historical, research-based  perspective on the merits of celebrating persons who &#34;think and feel more deeply&#34; rather than shallowly, as our current culture supports.  Should be especially interesting for couples of mixed introverts/extroverts who just don't get how the other thinks and acts.  The story about Rosa Parks--who would have thought she was an introvert, and lots of successful, famous people. A must-read.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|All I will say is if you like Zombie movies and never seen this when it was out, pick this up.  It has a great mix of comedy and zombie action.  You will not be disappointed.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I was very happy to see the movie, THE DESCENDANTS, finding George Clooney a truly fine actor in his role. Seeing the Island and hearing all the music brought me back to the time I had taken my mother, Maryann, there for two weeks at a time I had a business committment.  This had been her dream including seeing Don Ho.  Well, it all happened. It was magical and Don Ho greeted her making her his queen during our dinner at his supper club having her join him on stage sitting next to him as he sang to her. ( I had called for reservations and explained our visit to the manager.) We toured the downtown streets in rickshaws, went to the beach each day at sunset and bought fresh plumeria leis to wear to our dinners. I bought Mom the Lady style dresses of the island.  She looked beautiful.  So seeing this movie and hearing this music brought me back to a lovely time shared with Mom in late 70's.  Mom passed in 1981.The CD is just perfect for me to have and enjoy at anytime. Thank you.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|the best movie i have seen in years, and thats saying a lot because i see 2 movies a weekend, and have for years . even if your young you will relate to this movie.. it is a must see 5 stars..
B0006PV5VC|5.0|I had heard this entire cd on public radio, and found the info on the public radio internet site with the option to purchase from AMAZON. That was easy.  And that is why I ordered it.  It is amazingly beautiful.  Thank you. Charlotte
B008WCP2KG|5.0|no this is not an academy award winner but it is still a great movie, lots of eye candy. just a feel ggod movie and the dancing id amazing,,,
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This is a fun game.  I got it because a friend was playing.  It is not just a frivolous game, you have to THINK. You have to use your brain to determine what the other person is drawing and you must engage your brain again to come up with a drawing for the word you choose.  I can not draw, so that part of the game is doubly challenging.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|I have always been a fan of Family Guy, but hated that it had to be censored due to being on broadcast TV. Now, Seth McFarlane gets a real chance to shine, and he doesn't disappoint. I saw this in theaters and thought it was hilarious, but once I got the Unrated version on Blu-ray, it got even better. Everytime you think they won't take it any further, they prove you wrong. Great movie, and was a great price at $20 on release date.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is like having a thousand magazines available for viewing.  I have found a lot of projects for my garden and around the house, a lot of cleaning and recycling tips and yummy recipes.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was very funny.  I could relate to some of her experiences.  I think it would have been even better as an audiobook with Tina Fey reading.

1616614609|4.0|Very fun, nice job porting the original. The option to make a deck or use pre-generated decks is nice. Allows for new players to get in to the game very quickly, but once people know it being able to mix up decks gives good replay ability.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I read it once and it really help with my attitude. I will retread it to keep my positive thinking going.

B005FITIF0|4.0|This film depicts how easy it is to become deeply involved in something that you really feel passionate about. Excellent performance by Gerard Butler
B009HELT3C|5.0|When the movie ended I announced that this movie was worth &#34;All The Stars&#34; because it really was a fantastic story.<br /><br />But for the purposes of this review I want to say that the online rental process was easier than expected and there were no hiccups with the download or viewing.
B003TT2X72|4.0|It was very absorbing and interesting as are all the Lord of the Rings movies. Acting and direction very good.

B003O86FMW|3.0|The story started slow but picked up and moved quickly toward the middle. I can't wait to read the final book.
0061766089|3.0|Authors interview on NPR was more interesting than this book. Have read it once and may read it again in the future.
B001GXYBY6|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I put in a lot of man-hours watching the original Speed Racer episodes as a kid.<br />I was actually touched by the heartfelt homage offered up by the Wachowskis. This film captures Speed Racer and his crew in all their frenetic and kinetic glory. Awesome and incredible job!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Extremely addicting and fun Zombie Slaying game.  The samurai destroying zombies without mercy great idea and so awesome. Get this game.
B007HACDLK|5.0|If you've read Vince Flynn and Like VF then you will love this book .... you know who you are. He has an incredible ability to see and foresee how current American Policies are threatening America's very being!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm guessing the blue ray set for 69.99 and having the dvd sets on here at out of print 449$ price ranges is a empty scam to get more failing blue rays sold.  I'll wait for the dvd Saga set.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was great too! Keeps your attention! I didn't want to quit reading. This series is emotionally hard though!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A classic book that everyone should read around the christmas times. It is a great book to share with family.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I waited a long time before I started reading the books but then I couldn't quit! Very captivating and thought provoking!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|great game. winning prizzes and upgrading weapons.  potions that you can get and make. make money to get new stuff to become a bad Ase.
B009KHCT94|2.0|To bad..  I thought it was going to a fun flick in the vein of Mars Attacks...no such luck<br /><br />I had high hopes..camp is one thing..a lack of respect for your audience is another. Lazy writing and editing..with many needles scenes as though they were trying to run out the clock.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I don't know if mine was defective or what but sounded like I was in a barrel. The idea of it was good, just didn't like it.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This movie is great for kids and grown ups alike!  We have enjoyed all of the ICE AGE movies and would recommend them to anyone.
B003L77G06|5.0|I have never laughed so hard at a tv snow. I am a social worker and was told \\"every social worker needs to watch this show\\" and it is so true. It is a perfect and humorous portrayal of different families.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|I'm 19 and this is my favorite movie ever. Wonderful songs and adorable penguinnsssssss ! Much better than the sequel
B008OTTRXU|5.0|I am hoping my Gran Daughter really loves this CD,she kept hinting around & I can't wait to see her open & play this,Merry Christmas ~Shira~
B009KHCT94|2.0|I can appreciate the work put into this film.  However, I found it disappointing.  As far as entertainment value the trailer was much better than the movie.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it wasn't a complete waste of time.  If you need to kill some time, and can bear to sit through an hour plus of sophomoric cheesiness and worn out cliches, this is an option.
B00AEKFLOQ|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises was a great end to one of the greatest trilogies ever made. I won't spoil any of the movie's plot and will only say that almost everything seems to work perfectly: the characters, the plot, action, the sets. The only thing that seemed a tad off to me was the pacing, which seemed a bit slow at times. This movie doesn't quite pack the same wallop as the The Dark Knight but it is still one of the best movies of the year and one of the best comic book based movies of all time.<br /><br />The PQ is near perfect, the 1.78:1 Imax scenes are sheer perfection and the traditional 2.40:1 scenes are really great. The AQ is just perfect, every bit of dialogue is audible and the sound effects and music are all crystal clear. Most importantly is that the audio never needs to be adjusted! The special features are good: we get some nice production documentaries and HD trailers (which I think are always great to have). The lack of an iTunes copy is unfortunate but the UV digital copy serves well enough.<br /><br />The BestBuy steel book is quite nice. My copy came delivered to my house day one without any scratches or imperfections. It is not the typical glossy steel book that will scratch easily for those that worry about that. The cover art, with Batman's broken mask in the rain, is very well done. The two blu-ray discs and one DVD are housed sturdily inside.<br /><br />All in all, a very solid package, especially for those that have the first two steel book entries in this great trilogy.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|awesome, durable works great and its small so it can go in my rucksack, a great buy and super cheap
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It is very intuitive, as I don`t use anything that requires a steep learning curve.  If you want a good calculator, this is it.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|MicroScell is easy to use. it holds my Kindle Fire tightly.  it wll allow it to prop itself up.  Very nice
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter?...what can you say? A Lot....This film is the summary of the history of Sci-Fi as we know it. If anyone argues that point they don't know what they are talking about. You gonna tell George Lucas his film and his idea  sucked? Well the film execs did!!! If it had been left up to them we would have never had Star Wars...these people are so wrapped up into there ego's they would sabotage a film to keep it from succeeding if they didn't believe in it.  BTW, George Lucas admitted inspiration from this book to create \\"Star Wars\\"...why bother listeninhg to anyone...see the film and make up your own mind...if you still have a mind to \\"make up\\"
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|it was okay, a little vulgar. There were some pretty funny parts.<br />These are extra words to get to the minimum
B0058YPL66|5.0|I love this purchase!  One of my favorite shows on television!  I continue to watch it over and over again!  A must have!
B001VIMCW4|5.0|One of my favorite Bond movies. Rent it or buy it. This one is almost as good as Casino Royal
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|The film followed the classic appoach of the previous movies. Humor was fast, and some LOL. The plot twist was fun, and well executed. In my opinion, this was the best &#34;Men in Black&#34; yet.
B001HN694K|5.0|Very creative look at an old story. I loved everyone's performace, especially Johnny Depps's. He was a great Mad Hatter.  The costuming is also outstanding.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I've been very disappointed with the previous two &#34;007&#34; movies because of the lack of traditional humor and specific things that went into all of the previous 007 movies. (I've seen all of the &#34;007&#34; movies when they came out starting with Dr. No., and I have all of the DVD's, which replaced the VHS versions that I had as they became available.) I took my six-year old daughter to see the double billing of &#34;From Russia with Love&#34; and &#34;Dr. No.&#34; She is now a grandmother of four.<br /><br />Now the producers have seen fit to bring back the action theme music during 007's chases that I've heard for years, and I was unhappy that it was eliminated from the two previous Daniel Craig movies. (Spoiler) Additionally they brought &#34;Q&#34; back, with his magic tools and Miss Moneypenny. Hooray! Best of all, Adele sang a theme song filled with the sounds and emotions of the traditional Bond movies. It's more than likely to get an Oscar nod, as many of the previous opening them songs did.<br /><br />The live action stunts that Bond movies are known for, were excellent, including an excellent plot and fine editing, which kept me on the edge of my seat. I was pleased that Bond still likes his drink &#34;shaken,&#34; even though it was eluded to very subtly and previously put down in &#34;Casino Royale.&#34;<br /><br />The only questions reamaining now that I'm satisfied with Craig, is are we getting another new &#34;Bond&#34; for the next movie, and will the theme music and classic &#34;007&#34; approach to the movies be used appropriately from now on?
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Loved this movie! Rebel wilson is hilarious! going to watch again & again & again & again!  Watch if you wanna laugh!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Combine a weird Whalburg forcibly funny and the main characters from family guy on a vulgar rated R script and a forced love story. Not a very good movie...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The best book ever written. All that we need to know for now or the future is in this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you want just a basic calculator then this is the perfect App. No fancy math here just your basic adding, subtracting, multiplying, &amp; dividing.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Love the pull of the South in this book!  It kept my interest and was hard to put down.  It's a good vs. evil, Twilight meets Harry Potter type of book.
0395389496|5.0|Our children enjoyed this for years. Our 1 1/2 year old will enjoy for years to come. My be not this year.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has lots of surprises.  I love how it is written from two different perspectives.  It was a hard book to put down.  Finally, a more mature book to read vs. all of those I have been reading from the &#34;Teen&#34; section lately, speaking from a 40 year-old woman :o)
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Great action drama with good technical coverage.<br />One of the best high speed bike scenes I've seen<br />Great addition to the series
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I thought this was a really good book.  It was descriptive and I loved the pacing.  I was a little let down by the ending, but that wasn't because of the writing.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|The 2nd movie unfortunately robs the third any opportunity to come close to the suspense and tension that you felt with the Joker. On its own, the action or lack of it left you wanting the Joker or for that matter any villain other than Bane to shake things up. Bane would have been better had his terror been better fleshed out and Batman less whiny. You just felt wanting Batman to rise early rather than later.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Just using the app for a few hours on one day, it forced closed a dozen times. Annoying. I LOVE Pinterest so was more than a little tempted to just use the web browser instead of this app...
B008220CYM|1.0|Tom Cruise for Reacher is a joke.  Is there no one else out there?  I won't go see it.  I have read all child Reacher book and<br />Cruise is not the one for the part.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is unerring. When it comes to police procedurals, there's none better. And Harry Bosch continues  to be human, rough but likable. I enthusiastically recommend Connelly novels (though I much prefer the Bosch novels to the Lincoln lawyer series).
0783228007|1.0|First of all, I almost never rate movies, only the disk. Whether or not a movie is a good movie or not is a matter of taste. I don't dictate taste.    Joe Kidd currently comes in two different releases. I've rated both.    This review is for the DVD, not the movie Joe Kidd.    I first saw this movie earlier this year in an off the air broadcast (Amazon censored the network name ) which is why I bought the DVD. This seems to be the same version, but in wide screen.    The video in the off the air version is better. This DVD is a poor transfer, so poor I looked closely at it to make sure it wasn't pirated. There was even a thread sticking up in the first part just like what you see with an inattentive projectionist. It gave me the impression this was video taped from a theater release.    I think the studio did the minimum necessary to make this DVD release.    There are a lot of compression artifacts and the picture isn't that sharp. It's not that much better than a VHS release except it's in widescreen.    I can't comment on any missing scenes since I've only seen this on TV.    I recommend getting the Clint Eastwood Western Icon Collection instead. [[ASIN:B000N3SSBW Clint Eastwood Western Icon Collection (High Plains Drifter / Joe Kidd / Two Mules For Sister Sara)]] It has a much better transfer of Joe Kidd plus includes two other very good movies.
B009MO5G90|1.0|Greatly Dissatisfied as Prime Member: Disk arrives and of course the previews of the other movies work with no issues, even in 3D but the movie itself won’t play at all in 3D and when attempting to play in a 2D Blu-ray it skipped jump and sound cut in and out. Yes I requested for a replacement but now me and my family who waited for this have to rent it from Amazon just so we could see it when we were promised and then I have to go through the hassle of waiting for the replacement and then the time it takes for me to repackage and mail back a product that should of worked in the 1st place. As to Amazon; I am more disappointed with SONY for its poor quality control because it reflects badly on Amazon and the promises it makes. Return Comments are requested by others and by Customer Service.
B0065AVS0K|3.0|My husband watched this a few years ago and wanted me to watch it too.  It was a very interesting show.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I feel a thesaurus could've been used.<br /><br />Who has mind-blowing sex every single time?! A bit far fetched, but kept my interest enough to read the next book.
B00364K6YW|3.0|This is also a gift for a family member.  My mother-in-law really enjoys Pride and Prejudice and has asked for this version so we picked it up for her.
B0089XH38M|5.0|Was using webroot antivirus but it started to bug out with updates.  This one is doing fine so far.  Happy with performance
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|I don't think I realized how anxious I was through the entire movie til it was over. I think it took a few hours before my muscles finally relaxed. Talk about heart pounding action! My only qualm was the ending. Really? It just ends like THAT? Come on! They better hurry and release a follow up. I'm sure I'm by the only one who is on the edge of their seat waiting to see what happens next.
B001706I5I|5.0|My granddaughter down loaded it and they total got in to in!! Worth the .99<br />For the 1hr of peace

B0045TYDNC|5.0|I love the way these new lens caps fit--I have now replaced all my old lens caps with these new ones!
B0059XTU1S|5.0|Meet Bilbo Baggins a little hobbit minding his own business when he gets unexpected guest and starts an amazing journey that he will not forget. This movie is amazing. i think the hobbit trilogy will be better than lord of the rings. i'm not saying that lord of the rings is bad i love lord of the rings, but i thnik the hobbit will be a little better. it is about time they made it. i was really happy to see that they stuck pretty much to the book. they added a little bit to it but they did not shy from the book which is good thats why it's a trilogy. i was amazed by the actors performance and i was glad to see the original cast come back. this movie is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an awesome book and movie<br />There is suspence, action, mystery, and romance.<br />If I had to read one book for the rest of my life it would be this one!!!!!!!!!
B0000032LS|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do

B009329Y30|5.0|Loved this movie. It was a great love story.  Zac Ephron was great and the female lead, even though, I do not remember her name was very good too.
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|I was so pleased to see this offered. Love the show, enjoying the music.  Price was very reasonable on Amazon.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I use this app ALL the time. It opens quickly, has never let me down when searching for a word or it's variation. Very user friendly.
B00A3AUGEW|3.0|Philip was one of the best on American Idol and I was elated to see that he received a recording contract.  Enjoy his originality and soulful voice.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another wonderful Harry Bosch book.  You can't help but love Harry -- he is so inept in his personal relationships and so intuitive in his professional ones.  Each book develops him further and it is a blast to read.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Fun athough not too challenging. Kind of short, but for 99 cents, was worth the price. Story felt a little flat and secondary to the puzzles even though many puzzles had an \\"electricity\\" theme. Game ran just fine on Kindle Fire HD.
1619698366|5.0|I had preordered this book when it was announced and then purchased additional copies as I had the great fortune of meeting the author at a book signing in NJ. At first I was hesitant to read Carson's journal before having seen the film, but being a less than patient person, my curiosity won out. I don't think it detracted from my viewing experience in the least because the book truly is a separate entity. It works as a perfect companion piece to the film and while you don't need one to understand the other, I feel both are important to provide a &#34;complete&#34; Struck by Lightning experience. The order in which you choose to partake, is entirely up to you, and in my humble opinion, work equally well regardless of &#34;chicken or egg.&#34;
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Nowhere near as good as the first.  Felt like they just didn't care.  Storyline was dull. Typical sequel pitfalls.  All those stars, they should have done a better job.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Gory subject matter.  Hard to catch on to why we should care about the characters, and how their bizarre society works.  Some of the casting choices were worth reconsidering.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|i LOVE IT SO SO MUCH AND ASTOUNDED AT THE PRICE ITS BRAND NEW AND PERFECT NOTHING COMPARES TO A GREAT HARRY POTTER MOVIE!!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Great special effects, good plot, but it went on and on and on.....  The plot was difficult to follow due to numerous sub-stories. I think it could have been trimmed down to about 2 hours and our family would have enjoyed it a little more. Definitely worth the time to watch.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great ending to the trilogy. Kind of sad that it has ended but very good film. Would recommend to friends
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Movie follows seven seniors who move to the Marigold Hotel.  All are very different characters with very different reactions to their situation.  Lots of lessons for us old folks;  wouldn't hurt young folks to watch and learn, too.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my parents... I personally love this movie.. and I think it will be great for them. Got it SO QUICK!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Does what it's supposed to do and more. Like the estimates on remaining battery life based on what component is being used.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I didn't think it was possible, but I think Season two shines above and beyond Season one! I'm worried I might burn out my copy before Season three even begins filming!!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|The ending is weak. It had a lot of potential and lots of good action, but it seems like they just ran out of story-line and ended the movie. Definitely a setup film for the next release.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well i started reading this book and wonder if Christian Grey really exist. He is so good to be true. His difference to other guys is so deep which i think we dont have guys like that anymore.  I like this book! Bravo EL james.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy this collection.  Sometimes he sounds very much like Dave Matthews, which is why I originally like him on AI, but I enjoy the songs that are pure Phillip Philips just as well.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Great look and alarm sounds. Sounds really really loud on my kindle and hasn't crashed yet . I think it might wake us up
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this entire book in one day. I can't wait to read the rest of them. I now know what the hype was all about.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Strangers meet in a run-down hotel in India. All have their own reasons for being there. This is a movie about unexpected friendships and features some of the best acting talent Britain has to offer. It is way up there on my all-time list of favorites.
0875428940|5.0|This deck has beautiful artwork and a lovely positive feel to it... I'd recommend it to anyone interested in classic tarot.
B009B4ZEMA|5.0|Full of energy and vibe.<br /><br />Edgy and will make you want to move!<br /><br />Listen the the lyrics on &#34;Make the World Move&#34;.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Laugh out loud funny. Engaging, Sophie has that special \\" laugh @yourself humor\\" that keeps you reading to the end and wanting more.
1401322786|5.0|Very touching! It makes you realize that we have to cherish the present moment because it is all we have.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I like the movie.  it's not my favorite of all kids movies but well done and the kids think it's great.  Dr. Suess rocks
B000JQUKKU|5.0|It shipped on time and the product as advertised. Thank you very much for your prompt attention to my order.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|It shipped on time and the product as advertised. Thank you very much for your prompt attention to my order.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This seems like &#34;the real deal.&#34;  George Anderson is the &#34;real deal.&#34;  This man also impresses me.  I believe him.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I saw this movie in the theatre as a simple getaway from life that day. I left confused, frustrated, and almost more irritated than when I went in. My mind was in a whirlwind the whole time and I do not remember one single moment that I found entertaining enough for the $7 or whatever I paid that day, now that I think back, I really should have gotten a refund.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was a great story and perfect if you are a dog owner!! It was a quick read and spoke to the true journey of being a pet owner! Great read!
B006O3MU96|2.0|If you like doodle jump, I'm sure you'll like this. But II just don't know how anyone can just bounce up up up and not get bored. It's a very one-dimensional game. No variety, very little thought required.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much. My brother told me to get it and he was right about it being really fun! It the best game I ever played in the whole world!!!!!! And my brother is 14 and I am 13.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|i love this movie - im 19 years old and still watch it :) the songs and the acting - all comes together and is great!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This is one of the best Apps I've ever purchased for our Kindle. Each one of my kids enjoys it and they vary in age from four up to eleven. My four year old though literally has to be peeled away from playing this. She sits there with a huge smile on her face while giving the characters silly hairstyles. The game lets you do all sorts of things to the hair, cutting, growing,curling,straightening,shampooing,rinsing,blow drying, towel drying,coloring,adding accessories, and taking pictures of all your wonderful creations to laugh about later.<br />The only reason I took one star off is that it would be nice to have more characters included. I'd be willing to pay a bit more for that option. I also think it would be really great if they had makeup you could apply as well.<br />All in all though this is an awesome app for younger kids and really anyone. Okay I admit I find it kind of amusing myself!
B004CURZFC|4.0|love this film - love the animation and the story.  children enjoy watching it; they love to read the books
B008QTVNUI|5.0|As two trained Army interrogators, we enjoyed both the concept and authenticity of this show.  Complex, thought provoking, but not so dark as you would think considering the subject and flaws of the characters.
B005JR47R6|5.0|This tells all the details of what goes on in the production and the interaction between the crew and actors.
B000I186FW|5.0|I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it V for Vendetta.  It's a great movie.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|Very funny and heartwarming. At must see at christmas.Our children adored it.they realy felt sorry for elf.they identified with not fitting in and loved the outcome.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was really fun! It's family friendly and a great watch for girls night. The music was pretty good and the comedy was well timed.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|My all time favorite. It is the cuties christmas movie I have ever seen. Who could ever admit publically that santa isn't real not me I believe
B00005QB42|5.0|All of my favorites for yoga practice.  Her music make yogaa spritual experience.  This was recommneded by a yoga instructor
B008NEVP1S|5.0|Aimee Mann's latest is varied and catchy. Also, there are decent lyrics. Not much of that these days. I only recommend it for those who enjoy fine music.
B004LROUNG|4.0|A little predictable, but a good read. I would recommend this book if you are a Grisham fan. Enjoy it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is addictive! Everyone in the family plays this and it works flawlessly. Definitely worth adding to your library of apps.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I recently bought a DSLR and was looking for a container for the camera and all of the accessories I have and will get later. There is plenty of room in this backpack for them. It seems to be well made, too. I would recommend it if you are looking for the same thing.
0743454537|5.0|Skip the movie and read this book.  The movie does not do it justice.  I have purchased this book for several friends and they all loved it and thanked me for giving it to them.  I highly recommend it.
B006O3MU96|5.0|first it is free right now and this game is so much fun omg cant keep it in ahhhhh ahhhhhh ah ah ah ahhh
B007EDCWHA|1.0|Amazing and there is a lot of information! (Which I like and happy birthday to the one that has a birthday today!
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|We purchased both the Lego Star Wars Advent Calander and the Lego City Calander and felt that the Star Wars Calander had far less pieces and a lot less building of things.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|great.  from start to finish, as someone who has done extensive personal reading on the subjects herein, one would think there is not much more to learn.  but something about having the cold, hard facts laid out in front of you - in striking visual detail, no less - is very sobering - and informative.  from the killing floor of an industrial slaughterhouse, to the inhumane &#34;living&#34; conditions of a conventional feed lot or poultry farm, this film will leave you craving a permanent separation from the industrial food teat.  Here here!<br />Drawing on interviews from experts in the field - Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation), Michael Pollan (The Omnivore's Dilemma) & gifted farmer and writer Joel Salatin,  This film is the perfect entrypoint for anyone wishing to initiate a healthier relationship to their food and their world.<br />Be forewarned: you will see the food on your plate and in your grocery store aisles differently.  (and that's a good thing.) After watching this film, my lifelong carnivore sister took up vegetarianism.  My WalMart loving parents began subscribing to a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) share.  The truth is powerful.  And when given the voice and attention it properly deserves, has the potential to change minds and lives - for the better.<br />This film is definitely worthy of your time and attention.
B005USZML4|4.0|A very well written novel for the next generation of reading enthusiasts.  This makes you think of all the adventures a kid can have and not get into too much trouble.  I would recommend this book to my grandchildren for a fun way to learn more about our justice system and still be entertained.
B0060D123K|5.0|One of my all time favorite Christmas movies!  I love the muppets!  And a great telling of a Christmas Carol.
B004U52VPS|2.0|very cheap. parts do not stack easily. more fun to just play with than to use as a game. could be made much better.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|CD's arrived sooner than expected, which is a very good thing. I Loved the CD.will purchase from this merchant again.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It downloads then when I try to go to the game I get a error message saying it didn't download right. I've tried to download this twice now and both times got the same message.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|So far this game is great I love g5 games but I'm about halfway through and I just purchased the full version and now the game is locking up. I am trying to release the car and it wont let me do anything. when I bring up the screen to hook the rope I try to click on the hook and the screen disappears. same thing with all the mini screens I pull up. I'm going to be very mad if this is a gliche on the game. did anyone else have this problem?
0316228532|5.0|No more wizards and owls nor spells and wands. No real line between good and evil, right and wrong.  This wonderful book deals with the messiest subject matter of all; people and relationships.  And it is brilliant!<br /><br />The death of Barry Fairbrother leaves an opening on the local parish council in the small town of Pagford.  Born on the wrong side of the tracks, Barry was a champion for the inclusion of those unfortunates who cling to the underbelly of society.<br /><br />Small town politics come into play and soon enough ugliness emerges at it's own pace. The Casual Vacancy is absolutely not what I expected when I started reading.  The author has a uncanny eye for detail and just the right phrasing - a sense of griminess pervades the superficial facade of ordinary people in an ordinary town.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is not so much a page turner as it is a thought provoker.  A seemingly simple book that explores the deep themes of life, love, triumph and loss.  This book is geared towards mature readers who yearn for a well written book. Well, here it is!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Not as good as the book, but still very good . The movie followed the book with very few minor changes .
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Great for the whole family.  Funny, charming and has a good message.  Highly recommend it.  Christmas classic for years to come.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|My review is strictly on the quality of the set and not a review of the films. Sorry but these are fairly old films that you can find plenty of review of. Getting to the good stuff: The quality of the movies have to be seen to be believed, especially for the first two films. The remastering has brought the original up to the standards of today's releases and I can say this with full confidence: The first movie looks like it was shot in modern day. Clarity, Image Sharpness, Color and Audio make it feel like this is a movie trying to imitate an old production.  Aliens' quality is also pretty darn good but not as eye catching as the original for some reason. Aliens is also presented in Full Screen rather than wide screen like the rest of the films. As for Aliens 3 and Aliens Resurrection, I had a pretty hard time hearing a lot of dialogue in Aliens 3. Other than that no gripes about it's quality. Resurrection had it's share of audio trouble but it still wasn't as bad as Aliens 3. There is also another disk in the collection that is more of a &#34;making of&#34; for the set but to be honest I haven't had time to watch it. So there you have it.
0316228532|2.0|(spoiler alert) I had to give this at least two stars, because J.K Rowling is an excellent writer and though the story line is terribly depressing, the quality of her writing itself is certainly good.  It is just the story line she created that I could not enjoy.  The main character of the book dies in the first few pages, and then you have to learn about his character through the eyes of everybody else.  None, absolutely none of her characters are likeable.  There is nobody you can get behind and pull for; and then the one character that you end starting to hope that good things will happen for; commits suicide.  I could not even finish reading it and after I closed the book I put it in the trash.
B000002KKD|4.0|Greetings,<br /><br />A true 80's classic!!<br /><br />(I'm currently working on about 500 reviews, I order pretty much everything from Amazon but I (until now) never review. So I'm going through the years of orders to catch up, and try and give back to the system. If your reading this[...], it does help out the people that make reviews, and trust me it takes a lot of time... I try not to make long winded reviews, all of the specs are in the product description)
B0059XTU1S|5.0|In this age of short attention spans, many have said the movie was too long.  I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it because of the landscapes and beautiful places.  I was sad that it was over. I did not know going in that the Hobbit would be split in three.  This means they had plenty of time to introduce subplots, which were quite interesting.  The cast was undeniably great!  Even Christopher Lee, who is 90+ yrs. old appears as Saruman.  We get to meet a wizard of the forest, who was a lot of fun as an eccentric dog sled (in this case special super-fast rabbits) driver.  We do get a brief look at the elves again, and I truly love that place.  I really recommend seeing this when you really have a long, unhurried time of liesure.  This isn't something to get through quickly.  I think I will see it again at the theater.<br /><br />I want also to really emphasize that they really weaved some good humor in there too.  The evil darkness of the ring, while peeping out of the pit just a bit, was not falling all over making the film dark and depressing.  There's the famous great scene where they meet trolls in the forest at night.  The dialog, voices, and the way they try to reason with the trolls is truly hilarious.  People were not expecting it based on the darkness of the Rings trilogy.  Be open for humor!<br /><br />The other most funny character is the king of the Goblins.  The whole movie is just worth it to hear him speak and listen to his lines.  He is a bulbous, fat, ill-tempered, boil-covered, slobbering sweating gooey gross character, but he is really funny because amongst the gobs of ignoramous goblins, he has wit galore.<br /><br />Gollum fans will of course enjoy time with Andy Serkis's character.  All in all I am entranced by the Tolkein legacy and the beauty of these films.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|this is a very useful app considering most magazines have at least one scannable app to win a prize or to get more information on a product. It also helps to compare prices on products especially in stores advertising sales to find out if they are really sales or just a mark down of a marked up price.<br />It is clear and fast doesn't take a long to time search or scan and I have used it to scan names of books I want to read and remember to order. I recommend this app to anyone that uses their phone for almost everything like I do
0440246008|4.0|I am a big fan of the Reacher series.  Reacher reached me immediately the first book I read.  Sort of the Clint Eastwood of the military police (now ex-military), he has no reservations about deciding what is just and what is not.  This tale involves him being accidentally dragged into a kidnapping case.  Reacher really had to work hard on this one.  The plot is a good one and he is supported by good people.  In the supporting cast are some mercenaries who received some very damaging treatment in the dirty bowels of Africa.  I'm not sure if these soldiers' stories are based in reality, but it was pretty shocking and disturbing.  The main plot was not so distrubing, but the side story of the soldiers in Africa as POW's was quite disturbing.  This was a pretty intense cat-and-mouse game, but very entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very entertaining. it becomes a challenge after awhile because it becomrs more advanced but its a good game.(:
B0040JHXTS|5.0|This super deluxe box is dream for any fan of Springsteen from this era.  An unheard-of reproduction of his actual spiral-bound notebook from this era, with proposed track listings, scribbled lyrics (early versions, revisions, etc.) is the true treasure in the box -- and that's before you you get to any actual silver discs to play!<br /><br />Also included are CDs of a beautifully remastered version of the original Darkness On The Edge Of Town album, *2* CDs of outtakes and alternate versions (of &#34;Racing In The Street&#34; and &#34;Candy's Room&#34; [entitled &#34;Candy's Boy&#34;]) of songs from the album (some VERY different stylistically from the album, including 2 songs Bruce gave away to others -- &#34;Talk To Me&#34; which remains a mainstay of Southside Johnny concerts, and &#34;Because The Night&#34; which was a career-defining song for Patti Smith).<br /><br />Onto the Blu-Ray discs, there is the key to it all -- a documentary about the drama of making of this album, with lots and lots of fun black and white footage from the studio and rehearsals; then there is a modern day live performance of this album, recorded in a live setting, but without an audience; some various vault footage from this period, and the piece d'resistance -- a holy grail 3 hour video recording of a entire show from Bruce's tour for this album.  WOW!<br /><br />I have not had time to delve into all of the video stuff yet, but suffice it to say that I can't wait to check it all out and am quite overwhelmed with the quality of everything in this package!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book was wild - completely addicting and really did a great job of putting you in the mind of the protagonist
B005ZUR724|1.0|Tried this game on my old galaxy tab 2 7.0 so was excited to see it for my kindle fire hd. however, just like everyone else, unplayable due to nonexistant update. waiting for this mythical patch so i can play.
B005F96UNM|4.0|Personally, I really liked the movie.  It is a very interesting format that you must see to understand.  Josh Hartnett does a great job in this movie portraying a &#34;bad ass&#34;.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Stieg Larsson has done very good job of keeping engrossed in his work I enjoyed all three books.  The Titles I thought needed more work.
B000CPH9I4|5.0|This album to me says &#34;We're the Corrs, and we play what we want.&#34;  I am glad they did so.  It is very much the Corrs relishing and showcasing their heritage.  I am sure they had a blast recording it.  I always enjoy listening to it.  Since I am not Irish, when I listen to this album, it takes me on a cultural journey.  I especially like the songs done in Gaelic.  You really can't go wrong with the Corrs.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Im not a game player usually, but when Im bored I love playing this! Its fun when you dont have anything else to do.
B008J05EL8|1.0|why would anyone sell fonts separate? Greed, Stupidity, just made sure I never support this dev team ever again. I suggest you boycott them as well. It's a total ripoff, they would've been better off just raising the price and selling a complete product. This sucks. Amazon, don't let them do this to your customers, we are here because of you Amazon group. We just use this app cause you have it preloaded, Never again .
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The whole series was great, easy read, exciting at time, good read on your public transport commute. I would recommend reading the whole series to understand what finally happens.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|From the start the book sucks you in.  After reading &#34;Seal Of Honor&#34; this book completed the circle and gave me the whole picture of what happened.
B000UDNBQW|1.0|I really hated this book and cannot recommend it.  I was confused by the large cast of characters and didn't feel that the author tied all the parts of the book together in a coherent storyline.  There were plot lines that were left dangling and characters that I wondered why the author even bothered to include.  A dreadful and violent story.
B009MF56GC|5.0|My husband & I loved this in the theaters we knew we had to buy it when it came out, blue ray was great. I recommend this to adventure lovers that just want to be entertained
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Pitch Perfect was a lot funnier than I expected and the music was great.  The only drawback was the storyline which was set-up well, but fell apart near the end with some emotional beats that were not earned.  But if you are not paying close attention to story, the jokes and &#34;Glee&#34;-style musical numbers are more than enough to make it a fun watch.  There's a particularly well-done &#34;riff-off&#34; competition sequence where the a capella groups spontaneously square off against each other.  Also, be warned that there is 2 gross-out scenes concerning projectile vomiting, but they're done in such an over-the-top way that it did not bother this usually queezy viewer.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am 75per cent through this and as usual John Grshom is great. When he ticks to law or about the aw the books are great. I would recommend this book hate to put it down want to see what Max does ext.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|was at the edge of my recliner, a must see action movie, still missed the original actor though great movie
0316044695|5.0|This book is just amazing. Its a real book about real heroes. At the beginning it is a little slow, but there's a reason for it. Everyone should read this book and give it a chance.
0142501123|5.0|I have a 3 year-old boy and a 5 year-old girl and they both love this story.  They liked hearing this story night after night before bedtime. It quickly became one of their favorite bedtime stories. Although story includes a which, also includes animals and a dragon and is very cute. Especially nice around the Halloween season.<br /><br />As long as you don't have problems with witches or flying brooms or fantasy, you cannot go wrong with this book. It's a very fun read for your young kids and it's a quick read as well. A win-win situation if you ask me.  I would recommend to all my friends with young kids.
B000O599ZS|5.0|Great doing business with you. I got to show THE SEARCHERS to my class. For many college students, it was their first experience watching a western.
034580404X|5.0|These books are in new condition and worth every penny. We recieved it quickly and enjoyed every page! SO happy I ordered this set!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very kool game. the kids got me playing this! really njoy! I kan sit and play this all day long!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|If you have a clock app on your phone it does basically the same thing. I would recommend it though if you needed an alarm clock.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A book about love, in all its complicated forms. A love of flowers and their secret language, truth, and its unfailing tendency to look different from both sides, and the mystery of a damaged soul that pulls you in.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This is a fun game that is a great way to waste time if you have nothing else to do.  The challenges are good  but not all that challenging.  All in all I would recommend this app.
B006MOW98E|4.0|I was looking for something seasonal to read, and browsing throught the selections when I came upon this. I enjoyed Green's 'The fault in our stars' a great deal, so I thought I'd read a sample, and liked it.<br /><br />Let it snow is three very much intertwined stories, from all different points of view in the same situation. Despite there being three authors, there is no specific voice for each of the three, as I half expected to see Green's \\"voice\\" in the first story, and have the next two be completely different. Instead, I found a delightful trio of stories that I really enjoyed!
B008CJ0KBU|2.0|The premise is great (read a book titled Succubus Blues for another take on the whole succubus idea) but the execution disappointed.  Premier started off decent and then went downhill. Bad plots & writing most especially.<br /><br />I am used to the quality of Castle, Grimm & Once Upon A Time, so was hoping for similar treatment.  Special effects?  Not happy with the placement (or lack thereof) or quality.  Fae effects?  Should have been more and again of bad quality.<br /><br />As for the characters themselves, there are a few that are a great idea but not fleshed out enough for my liking.  Bar tender is awesome and actually reminds me a lot of Mac in the Dresden Files, especially when it comes to sanctuary and neutral territory.<br />Light and Dark Fae - barely can tell the difference 'tween the 2 and Bo/Beau is supposed to make a choice between the two?<br />Kensey - potentially a good character but written more as an irritant or comic/shocking relief instead of being given abit more depth.<br />The wolf - he's supposed to be a cop?!  HA<br />The siren - he's also supposed to be a cop?!  Double HA.<br /><br />This is only the first season, one hopes for improvement.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This isn't a book that will leave you alone once you put it down. As a parent I found the book disturbing, thought-provoking, and found that it made me go places I never wanted to be. Empathy and horror are rarely bedfellows, yet this book pulls both out of the reader.  What would I do is the question one can't help but ask.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|There are 2 different albums for this movie, and I recommend THIS one instead of the other one.  This album is a bit more, but it has more tracks, and is a joy to hear.  When I saw the movie I immediately decided to get the soundtrack, having others from Howard Shore for LOTR plus a book about that music.  It was fascinating to hear in detail music that in the movie is overshadowed by the action and sound effects - a common fate of composers' soundtracks, I'm afraid.  This album lets you hear what Howard Shore wanted us to hear, and it is well worth listening to.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|A modern day Druid makes for an intriguing storyline, I didn't expect it to be as well written and purely entertaining as it is. This is magic that you can believe in, a main character that is just, well, is just a likable guy who happens to be a few centuries old. Fun reading, and it is always such a great pleasure to finish reading a book you really enjoy, as I did this one, and then find out there are more in the series just waiting for you to read.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It keeps track of your lists. It has different colored paper.<br />You can also make fun messages. Get this app today!!! :)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This made it easier to delve into the period of the war that my parents lived through.  It helped me to understand a lot about my upbringing and my parents' world. My Dad survived the Battle of Midway which is the reason why I am even here today. I love Ken Follett's characters in all his books.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|Absolutely beautiful set. A great addition if your a fan of great music, and a must if your a fan of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer!
075669812X|5.0|every child who loves Ninjago will love this book.  It has great content and it even comes with the green ninja figure!
B003FSTN52|5.0|I started watching this with Season 3, so it was really interesting to see how it all began. I really like how Alicia has grown into her own since the beginning.
0525952926|4.0|Unfortunately I didn't know there were other books involved in the trilogy...  I would suggest that customers read the first book before reading this one...
B000I9VZ8O|5.0|very enjoyable movie.. ordered it saturday received it monday..absolutely love amazon.com! i looked everywhere and it was only in stock at amazon
B009CPJHY4|3.0|My wife and I thought the story of the movie was good, but for out likes it had a little too much &#34;city traffic&#34; in the movie which was disturbing.  Overall it was OK.  The actors did a good job.
B0012QRPU4|4.0|Actually I didn't watch it Someone recommended it somI was just testing it but it was actually about the making of the series and I didnt have time to watch it
B00APUQJLO|5.0|Cosmopolis is easily one of the most Intelligent movies I have ever came across. It deals with many thick economic issues and philosophical questions in portraying a story of a young billionaire grappling with his own faith on the so called \\"economic system\\". The dialog is the hallmark of the story, and allows the audience to come to different interpretations on their own. If anyone finds it difficult to understand the story, I recommend listening to the dialog and observe and you will see the story unfold in such a dramatics fashion. Finally, I was particularly impressed with the Twilight star, Robert Pattinson and his charismatics performance as Eric Packer. He has an uncanny ability to make Eric's baser character relatable. Overall, I could easily place Cosmopolis as one of my favorite movie, but I would not be surprised if some people find it difficult to understand. What makes Cosmopolis a fascinating story is its tangled complexity and you as a viewer's ability to untangle it.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I like this book.<br />Short. Clear. Only important information.<br /><br />After reading this book I changed my normal training schedule and now I hope for much better results.<br /><br />Also I like some myth-breaking things inside.

B006YTTVHO|5.0|I do really well with meeting new people. I just wanted to see what others seemed to have problems with. This book seems like it would help someone learn the basics. Being bubbly with the perfect amount of professionalism is my go to :)
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Excellent toy to use a kids brain.  They have to be patient and persistant and not give up.  Love this toy Should get toy of year award.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There's was no way i was going to click &#34;Liked&#34; and not comment about this amazing book. I've never been sooo effected by a book this much EVER and i mean EVER.  In this past year since i got my Kindle ive gone through soooo many romance book and nothing is comparable to this book. Thnxs Mrs. Hoover for writing this amazing heart wrenching love story, u r truly gifted! Im looking forward to reading ur next book. Pls write more books like this im sooo happy i came across this book. I will definitely read this book again and again!!! :DDD
1419702238|5.0|Eight year old loves these books.  I have set and read them aloud to him and he asked me to buy to add to his library of books in his room.
159514188X|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why was suspenseful and addictive and I finished the book in several hours(with restroom breaks of course). I highly recommend this novel to readers, especially those who have had suicidal thoughts before or can relate to Hannah Baker's experiences. Even though it was highly intriguing and the format was inviting, I thought the reasons Hannah Baker gave for her suicide were too minor. She seemed to stretch those reasons and made them seem more dramatic than they were. Most of them were just embarrassing cases, not experiences deserving of a suicide;nevertheless, it was a great book overall.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|i love it but it lags at times but well worth it want an update to play more levels but its a great game
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Very nice movie. I watched this in HD quality and the movie was perfect. I really enjoyed witching. This movie and can watch it again
B003ODIZL6|4.0|The new Oxford dictionary helped me find words for my report that I aced it made it the easiest report ive ever had to do .
B006PKQQJS|5.0|I thought it was lame at first but it turns out it it is really fun and its 1 of the best apps I have
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Best book I have read In a long time.  Couldn't put it down.  I recommend this book especially to those who, like me, will never forget that tragic day.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I ordered these to use for running. The sound quality was not great, but they stayed in my ears decently. The problem was that by the second time I used them I started feeling little electric shocks in my ear, (and no I did not use them in wet weather, not do I sweat much during runs in the cold of winter). They're in the trash now...not worth returning.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I have 3 different camera configurations in 2 homes; one home has a Panasonic wired IP pet cam and an older QSee 4 camera server and in the other a zmodo 8 channel dvr. I wanted to be. ble to watch all cameras in one app on my kindle fire HD and smartphone.<br /><br />There is a big list of camera options provided but all of my exact camera models were not listed. Not to dispair as there is a built in utility that will scan your network info provide and identify a camera model and configuration.<br /><br />I can now see a panel of all of my cameras and select any camera to make full screen.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Oh wow.. I loved this book, travis might be able to pack a punch but he is such a sweetheart
B005EHILV4|5.0|works as its own sound device when plugged in usb, solved many sound issues I was having with my live video broadcasts.  the issue I was having was my audience could hear the presentation but my mic only came though my local audio.  it gave me great control of my audio options.
034580404X|5.0|Oh I loved these books, I have read them twice and they still pull me in and I can't put them down, I love Ana and Christian
B00170DEM8|5.0|This is one of our family favorites every year or two. It doesn't solely revolve around Christmas but has that spirit to it. The dancing and singing are better than any cg special effects and the humor is subtle but perfectly delivered. Grab a blanket and your family and prepare for your heart to be warmed.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I enjoyed this book but not as much as Bared to you, this one is drama packed and all about head games. Eva and Gideon are trying to make there obsessive relationship work, when its good it's good when they hit a rough patch it tit for tat. Gideon is possessive and jealous Eva is jealous and insecure. Gideon finally opens up about one of his secrets, something happens to Cary and someone from Eva's pat returns. The ending left me hanging I can't wait to read what happens next and hope Gideon and Eva get there HEA
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Ok. so for those of you who keep saying it is unbeatable...I just beat it. So anyways. this is such a good game! I reccomend it to anyone who loves brainteasers!
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Always been a fan of Harry Potter and the wonderful special effects they all Have.  Will continue to buy them as long as they make the Harry Potter movies.
034580404X|5.0|I haven't finished but it's hard to put it down. What I've read so far is keeping me turning the pages.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|For me, this is an awesome app to organize Bible study notes and keep them all in one place. You can list things, make check boxes, e.t.c, but to me it's near perfect.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Good ending. Wrapped up nicely. Quick read with good pacing. Sad the series is over for me. Enjoyed reading it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Goodwin clearly shows the history and progression of the times. Fascinating read! I was unaware of much of American history during this period even thogh I have read much about the Civil War
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Had to put my kids to bed early so I could read. Was a hard one to put down, for sure!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great show with good story lines keep you on the edge of your seat can not wait for next episode
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is an app everyone should have. This is easy to use on my Kindle Fire. To look up words is fast.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I have watched the Ice Age film for years now and I must admit, Continental Drift is the funniest one yet. I bought this movie for my little sister for Christmas and she loved it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes funny, Animated & adventure films. But all I really can say is watch it for yourself. You like it, that's for sure.
B009E3EY38|5.0|It's what I wanted and more. If your A Zep fan, you will love this.<br />And i don't have 5 more words to say about it.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|i lchose it because i read the 1st book of the trilogy and i like the period description although it was europe dark age
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Played a few games. Not very challenging. More appropriate for children.  It was free so I guess that could be a plus.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I think this game takes a lot time but it is very challenging fun it reminds of command conquer but a easy version
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book. More than what you expect. Can't put it down. Can't wait to read the next one. Very good
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|It didnt suck.  It just wasnt as good as I heard it was.  Probably best suited for men.  It seems like boy humor.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|this is a good solid action movie. the action is all good. the actors are 1st rate. i've always loved Colin, and this movie is worthy of him. and for me the plot is really well thought out. Different than the 1st movie with Arnold, different plot and better future world, and they also kept a few points from the original movie and incorporated them, well, into this one, but didn't over do it. i like that. great director. 4 stars.
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|This turned out to be a total waste of money, If I could rate no stars I would. Put it together, and it will not shoot. The darts jam , and will not drop in to the blaster slot. My grandchild was super disappointed as was I.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Very easy to read and get the main points- I started Paleo the moment I finished it and my husband and I have lost 30 lbs between us.  I feel great and the recipes are easy to follow and have much variety.
1401922732|5.0|This card arrived in one day to me which was great.  I have a few of Doreen's cards & love them. My Reiki Master in 2002 introduce me to her hers and I must say I like all of Doreen's cards that I have to date. I am looking forward to her new cards coming out next month that she did with her daughter-in-law. Doreen used them in her video two weeks ago. Very clear readings. Blessings to everyone. Enjoy.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I delightful, vulgar, movie. I highly recommend it. Seth is a genius. I have to use 8 more wrds, word
B002VPE1XE|1.0|I got this as a freebie when I bought Canon A2300 - but this sleep is double the size of the camera and looks ugly to carry that big bag for a small camera - they should have thought about the size before offering this one. I trashed the bag and bought another one.
B00838HSYM|1.0|I bought this blu-ray thinking that it worked on American players, because I am on the amazon usa. However, the seller using Amazon to process their orders is sending blu-rays from England. They do not state that it is imported anywhere on description and that it will not play on American blu-ray players!
B00A7CI82I|1.0|As of Dec 24@8:21 I still haven,t recieved it yet. I guess that it is coming by snail mail.As of rite now ,I don,t know if I,ll order agin.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I just love the supernatural series................they can never go wrong with me.....Sam, Dean and Castiel are the best...koodos to CW
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's a very nice calculator.  But why is it so big?  Nine megabytes...hmmm?  Also-why isn't there a calculator built in to the kindle?
B006O6F932|5.0|So I bought this for my daughter for Christmas this year, I got this at Target  for 39.89 I pick it up right away so check urban local Target. I pick it up abfew days ago I find it by the broad games weird but I didn't see them next to the dolls so look around u may found one as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and soooo adicting. But for me i like to find different yames after awhile and when i eventually came back to this game..it reset. I had like 5 characters and they were all gone except for the main one. Even my coins went down to zero. But i still think it deserves 5 stars (: Great app for kids and adults (:
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I loved it, there is still hope for romance to rekindle.  Tommy Lee Jones hit his CAREACTER right on.  Meryl Streep<br />was also great
B00785P2QC|5.0|fun game but drains batty fast I'm glued to this game I just started this but its going well but still cant make all the challages
B0058X67OM|4.0|I really love ELP.<br />It is one of my favourite bands.<br />This box is enough to understand ELP.<br />Buy it!!

B001AQT11M|5.0|Timelessly classic Disney movie. Full of love and humor. I enjoyed watching this movie, and now own it so my future children can enjoy it as well. Any Disney movie lover, with love this delight.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Very enjoyable movie. The singing was engaging and the dialogue was very witty. My kids loved this movie. Even my husband liked it if that is a recommendation! The ending was a bit scary and may be too much for very small viewers. My daughter saw this when she was just turning 5 and she was fine but she has nerves of steel and nothing bothers her. The ending is eventually happy but for a few minutes there my husband and I sat there in horror thinking our kids might be traumatized for life. Luckily, it all worked out well and parents may want to see this first so they can explain what is happening in the end. This isn't like when Bambi's mother dies off screen. The rest of the movie is great though and it is definitely worth watching.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME.  IT IS ADDICTIVE.  I WILL TELL ANYONE WHO LOVES ANGRY BIRD, THAT THEY WILL ALSO LOVE BAD PIGGIES
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We loved this movie! The characters were so clever and the three princes were hilarious. We laughed and cried at this movie. Per the norm for Disney there are some scary scenes that might frighten younger viewers however nothing bad really happens. This movie was a pleasure to watch. The soundtrack is also really nice.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Nice box, booklet and special features, a really nice gift! Don hesitate and get them, blu ray rules and batman too!!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This book is very differently written and you really have to be on your toes to keep track of what is going on and to whom. I really like the plot and find it to be very clever and well written. It is NOT for kids, at all as an FYI. The characters are interesting and I found myself caring about what happened to them fairly early in in the book. The jumping from person/time was a bit jarring to me however, it was so well done that I worked hard to overcome that feeling of irritation when a chapter suddenly segued into someone else's story. This book is absolutely worth reading.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|watched this movie with the whole family & told everyone they need to watch it too! the plot's not complicated, and mark wahlberg & mila kunis are hillarious!
B009CPE424|1.0|I don't think there are words in the English language to describe how bad I found this movie. I was into expecting greatness mind you. I would have accepted it just being funny or at least somewhat humorous and I found it to be neither. The first movie was good-ish at least, it was certain,y better than this version. Save your sanity and watch the first one only!
B00846F1YW|3.0|it was a fun game until I got to chapter 13 and can't. get passed it. I have taken recommendation. from other people who have written reviews and nothing had worked.wish. I knew how to contact them. it seems all you can do is stop.payment.
B003U6BE8I|1.0|I really, really wanted to like the movie. I did. The actors playing the &#34;children&#34; are way too old and the acting is sub par at best. The script was tired and not even the inclusion of Pierce Brosnan and Uma Thurman could help this pitiful exoerience. For such a popular series you would think they could have made a better movie. The books and audio books are fantastic and I recommend sticking with those.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great trilogy. Enjoyed all three books. They are one better than the other. Really gets you thinking, sometimes too much.
B0053IOZBE|4.0|I enjoyed the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie so much that I got the books to read to my son. The books are hilarious, this movie was just not my favorite of them. My kids thought it was hysterical though so that made it better.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|good movie over all. Action love story of the future. I would watch it again and buy it. Would recommend
B0091XRL86|4.0|This movie is a bit odd and dark. I like it however, the plot is so out there that I did not enjoy it as much as I could have. I shan't spoil the movie for anyone by saying any more though. It is funny but not in the same way that Wallace and Grommet are funny or even Chicken Run which is much more in line with the odd/dark overtones in this movie.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|Fun movie - our family watches it every Christmas.  This one was purchased for our daughter who recently moved to another state.  She wants to start her own Christmas movie collection.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I really like this book even though it is not my usual fare. It is definitely not a children's book - I would recommend 15 and up. There are some very adult themes in this novel and kids have so many other wonderful options out there that they would not miss this one. I found the plot satisfactory and the dialogue witty and engaging. The book read &#34;smartly&#34; and do not dumb itself down. I enjoyed the characters although I wish there was a bit more development of some of them. Everything else in the book was highly enjoyable.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Clever, but a bit on the boring side. It was a little bit slow, but it was somewhat creative in some ways.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works exactly as it is supposed to and for a good price. We have not had any negative issues with it so far.
B009ZE27US|1.0|This app is terrible! Don't get this app unless you like apps that lie. I am 14 years old and this app said I am 47.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Keeps you grateful for all the wonderful people and things in your life and brings more of the same great experiences
B005EWDA9M|4.0|Just finished book 1 & 2. Will buy book 3 after finishing this review. His world is fascinating and weird at the same time.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|Being a fan of both artists, I was expecting at least something good, if not great. Needless to say, I was in no way disappointed. One of the most original albums I've heard in years. Sheer musical brilliance.
B005LAII6C|5.0|I bought this movie for our 18 hour trip and my daughter and granddaughter had to watch this movie over and over and not fight.
B004ZNAXX2|3.0|The Wall is a masterpiece, and will always be so. Yet this box is not. Perhaps if it had been the first of the Immersion boxes to come out, I would give it a higher rating, but having been spoiled by the 5.1 mixes on the first two sets, as well as the brilliant supplements, I was rather disappointed that there would not only be no 5.1 mix in this set, but that part of the package was just a repurposed live set that's been commercially available for 10 years. A must-have for completists (if only for the demo versions of pieces from the album), but a maybe for the rest.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I don't think &#34;Secretariat&#34; even came close to the making of this movie, and the acting. It's &#34;one of a kind.&#34;
B007SAKSF2|5.0|There really are no words that can describe, as a Blur fan, the awe I feel when appreciating this set. No stone was left unturned in finding material for this package. The amount of b-sides, demos, unreleased tracks, and live performances included in this box, along with the stellar original albums, is incredibly satisfying and truly entertaining. Probably the best box set I've ever owned.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|This movie was horrible. Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring. If you're still reading this review you are probably more entertained than you would be watching this movie.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|While this is by no means the strongest season of ST:TNG, the blu-ray is, as the season 1 blu was, an amazing package. Picture and sound quality are superb, and the supplements are highly informative. A must-have for any fan of the series.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|Pros:<br /><br />1. Easy to install in OSX. Rather than using the driver on the included CD, I recommend finding an updated driver (search the web for \\"AX88179 driver\\" and you should find the product page of the chipset manufacturer).<br />2. Most platforms seem to be supported (I'm still using OSX 10.7.4 for now, but Mountain Lion is apparently supported too, along with Windows, Linux...)<br />3. The price is not bad.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Jumbo Frames: Using ifconfig, I am not able to increase the interface's MTU above 4070. The chipset's product page does not specify a max jumbo frame size. 4070 is alright but the rest of my network is running at 9000.<br /><br />If I hear back from Asix about the jumbo frames, I'll update this review.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Boring and predictable. I was really disappointed because I love Nolan and loved the other Batman films. This was just really bad, the villain became monotonous and annoying, and I struggled to finish it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written.  A GOOD ACCCOUNT OF THE ACTUAL MISSION I THINK.  SOME WILL SAY IT'S NOT FACTUAL. I HAVE NOT COMPLETED READING THE STORY/ACCOUNT.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|Love Jim Carey and my grandaughter has watched it at least 20 times. She LOVES it and she is only 4 1/2.
B00867GHS8|5.0|this was the greatest buy ever i would recommend this to everyone who loves nemo the 3d blu ray is the best and not to mention you get 3 other copys of the movie and a bonus disc
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book pulls you right in. You think it's going to go one way and then a few surprises. The ending didn't quite live up to the rest but overall an entertaining read I didn't want to put down.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee is a very strong young women. This story is filled with hope. this book kept me engadged untill the last page.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|My wife loves the sherlock holmes movies so It was a must to buy them :3 The Packaged arrive early which was awesome! Love the blu ray quality!
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|If you have a sense of adventure or at least enjoy watching other take them, this is a great movie for you. I also love to see, hear and read about people triumphing over adversity or near death experiences. This movie gets very graphic, but I truly think the story is so inspiring that it's worth stomaching the bloody parts. I jump out of my skin with excitement at the end.<br />Enjoy :)
B007KAJG3K|5.0|My wife loves the sherlock holmes movies so It was a must to buy them :3 The Packaged arrive early which was awesome! Love the blu ray quality!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Though the story line was not as good as the Matt Damon Bourne series, it was a fun movie- fast-paced, exciting chase scenes, a perfect movie to rent!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|i watched faithfully when the season was on air. I fell in love! now that i have it on dvd i love it even more! no commercial interruptions and the special features give me the inside look!
B003UESJF6|5.0|We love this movie; I have girls ages 5 and 8.  I think it is well done and also witty enough to keep the adults entertained.  Saw it in the theater and then wanted it to watch at home.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|upon first being introduced to this group on the radio.. i was hooked! this band is like having 6 well known artists.. (keane, the killers, coldplay etc.) have a love child together and they are it!! the songs are just perfect! some upbeat some just plain fun! i thoroughly enjoyed every song!!!
B001KZG99A|4.0|We rented this as instant video and watched on the laptop.  The streaming was horrible.  I guess that's what you would call it; there were a couple of hiccups in the delivery, but the main problem was that the picutre was dark and we could see what looked like a live graph ghosting across the screen for most of the film, almost like audio bars moving up and down behind the scenes.  Weird.  We turned it on again the next day and it seemed fine, so I guess we just picked the wrong night to watch it!<br />But again, I'd reiterate that the movie was very good.  Paltrow is not my favorite, but she did a good job in this film and Downey was made for the part.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|This movie is dead on for any office environment with 10 or more people in it.  Stereotypes abound and I could see many of my former co-workers represented. One friend is getting a red stapler for Christmas.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|My dad showed me this musical when I was ten I've been addicted ever since. How could you go wrong with a plant that eats people? You can't :)
B00A14SQBU|3.0|I love her but this album is just ok. I am disappointed... truly. Still love her though. :) So keep on making music.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix is an amazingly talented a Capella group and the only bad thing about this Christmas album is that there aren't enough of their songs on it!  I want more... will be downloading other songs from them as I find them.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Great flick, great animation and good story with food for thought for young minds. One, two, three, four, five, six.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I have not watched this yet but the price was the best, i love the movie seen it before decided it was time to own it. The package came in time and wraped, new and i thank you so much,
B001V7UXG2|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows. Hugh Laurie and Steven Fry are hilarious. I would recommend this to all of my friends
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I got this wrapped up nothing wrong with it, great movie cant wait to watch it on my new tv i for from amazon, very excited.
0393342212|5.0|This is a great book that has given us a lot of perspective about parenting two kids. The authors introduce ideas that did not occur to us, and we feel more confident about fostering our kids' relationship with each other. At first we weren't sure about the format of the book (kind of walks you through a support group that the authors have run), but it worked. Highly recommend!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I got this at a great deal during thanksgiving week DEAL of THE DAY, for like 5 bucks, great buy just waiting to get 2 and 3. The package was good no problems, no scratches, looks new and it is lol, thanks again!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this game is amazing I have played it for not even a day and I love it what else I love is l.o.l
B009A87X80|5.0|I really liked everything I've bought so far. Two things on this list I haven't received yet. I'm sure they'll be great.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This movie is made for romantics like myself. The movie ties together multiple relationships while going on that true love does exist, but sometimes you have to travel as far as Wisconsin to find it!
034580404X|5.0|I would recommend this three book set to anyone who loves a great romance. Page Turner. Couldn't put them down. I will reread them again. I even purchased the classical album CD that goes along with the books.
B000065KB3|2.0|The last few very disappointing minutes of this movie breaks from the comparison of this couple to Romeo and Juliet, making it neither tragic, satisfying, clever, nor romantic.  That Juliet could walk away from Romeo, and that Romeo would let her, is just flat disappointing.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Basically, it's about a dance. At the beginning it's really funny because it talks about when Greg was a baby.. sooooooo really like it :D
1449410243|5.0|Very funny, made for many good giggles Chistmas morning.  Not so great for young kids, purrfect for adults.  Not a very long book, but totally worth it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Although it was not a &#34;great&#34; read, I felt so interested in the plot and the characters' lives that I definitely HAD to finish the book. Ms. Rowling masterfully created three-dimensional characters in this book - unfortunately, a few too many. I was also impressed with the extremely-involved and intricate plot - and part of wanting to finish the book was just plain curiosity at how she tied off all of the loose ends, which she artfully managed to accomplish. It is not a happy read, although it is amusing at times. It seemed like most, if not all, of the characters frequently had downright demoralizing and demeaning interactions with each other -- and eventually this became so tiresome that I could not wait for the book to be finished. It did not make for &#34;uplifting&#34; reading, but I was glad to experience another facet of this amazing author's talent.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|A gift for my daughter, i'm sure she will surely enjoy them.  She loves the show and watches on tv
B001UV4XHY|4.0|If you're a Harry Potter fan, you'll love this. I know prices for this DVD are dropping at the stores but this price is great. The quality of the DVD is spectacular. The offers in the box have long since expired so don't get excited when you see them. I find, as I found in the theater, that Pt.#1 dragged a little at times. Blesphamy you say? Truth, I say. The relationship between Emma and Ron is awkward to say the least. The relationship between Harry and Jen Weasley is budding (cute). Make no mistake. I don't recommend it for younger children without pre screening by a parent. The last few HP movies are almost HP noir and the amount of violence has increased to a much sharper level. Everyone seems to get \\"it\\" but Harry. His reactions to situations are somewhat immature, but I'm digressing. The DVD quality is fantastic. Plays well on 1080p. No problems. Except for the 20 minutes of ads, old movie releases etc. but for them, I would have given it 5 stars. I imagine they keep the cost down. But the quality, accuracy and speed of delivery were spot on, Amazon.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|a gift for my daughter, i'm sure she will enjoy them, she watches the tv show faithfullly. She will most likely want the complete set (all seasons).
B0076DELIG|3.0|After a long career of writing magnificent stories, Michael Connelly has become a modern day literary icon. We've become used to expecting better of him each time, and he always delivers. I had a problem with this book from the beginning, though. I don't believe the first 198 pages, which set up the story, were written by him. The text is tedious, boring and full of explanatory sentences about police procedure. Suddenly, in part two, the cadence changes and it's Connelly all the way. The book has a good plot, but it doesn't really become a page turner until almost three fourths into the story. However, overall, especially for Connelly fans, not a bad read.
0316069434|5.0|A great story, great action, I loved this book.  For an intriguing book that absolutely grabs your interest from the first page, buy this book.  Carmen H
B00005ASOC|5.0|This is a story of an unlikely couple. A young lad from Harlem and a notable writer who by chance end up together and how that  comes about. It becomes a very interesting story. How they help each other throughout and a lifelong friendship happens.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows on tv. Can't wait for season 3 to begin in January 2013. Bravo to PBS.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good book!!! Couple of unexpected twists!  I always enjoy Nicholas Sparks books!  Great love story!  Can't wait for the next one!!
B003PBB4ME|5.0|The design is simple enough so I wouldn't expect any issues with the product itself?  Not much more I can say until I've used it which again, I'm expecting to be fine.
B00873GRU4|4.0|I read Wool, as it had been recommended to me, however I rarely read sci-fi. Perhaps now I might change my ways.<br /><br />I did enjoy the slow build  revelation of the plot line, and found the overall story engrossing.<br /><br />It is listed as a trilogy and therefore I look forward to the next installment.
B0091WM4TI|4.0|Love this movie. Christian Bale is awesome as always. I would have given 5 stars but the storyline btw Sam Worthington and the girl was kind of stupid. Still, this movie is worth owning and watching over and over.
B009CPIR9K|3.0|It's a bit wired in the begging and hard to supend you belive about life on the Moon, but if you stick with it you'll be treated to quite a few laugh and suprising ending.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I love this series.  Super interesting to watch.  I like how they can look through the evidence and see what really happened.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|If your a fan of the orginal you will do okay with this move.  The Megan Fox replacement is more engaging
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I found this book comforting, funny, sad, and well written. I have never cried or laughed so hard for any book.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It's such a wonderfull book!  Lots of stuff happens in the book thats  not in the movie. It's also free !!!!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|It took her a bit to figure out how it worked, and it is challenging enough to keep her interested.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Really fun. Like it better than angry birds. Get this app! If you want a fun game get this 1!!!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love Taylor swift, but there are some songs that I don't know, but what I  love is when CD provide lyrics! So it provided songs that I did not know!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love how we can choose what we want to look at. There are so many funny posts that make me laugh all of the time. Love it!!!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read this book as it was chosen by our book club. It was confusing at times.<br /><br />I would never have chosen this book myself. I love mystery and thrillers and this certainly was a mystery storyline....but.not thriller...
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Me and my husband are big fans of box sets and have watched lots of them including The Wire, Prison Break and Breaking Bad. Homeland is fantastic - it keeps you on the edge of your seat, the casting is brilliant and it's thoroughly entertaining. I'd highly recommend this to anyone!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Had to replace a Nikon sb-16 and decided on the SB-400.  What a great replacement.  It is much lighter, but has the bounce feature of the SB-16, which was one of my main requirements.  It meets the requirements I had for a flash unit, is a Nikon and works well with my D70.  I shoot a lot of candid photos of people as a group or individually while partying or traveling together and of landscapes and architecture.
0375703764|5.0|If you want something hauntingly beautiful where every word, every position of word, every nuance has a point and every page envelops you then buy this.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|This is best movie ever in my opinion!! However I am a true Transformer fan so I am biased.  This came extremely fast and well packed.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Watched first episode under duress from my wife and got hooked. Anxious for the third season to start in Jan.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|This is such a great movie.  If you love Sherlock check this out.  Every movie I have gotten comes well packed.
B0095R6OBS|5.0|None the less, extremely entertaining.  Loved seeing all the references to other Frankenstein movies.  Well worth the two bucks and thirty minutes time.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|This sequel is even better than the first one.  Very intense and the directors style is most unique. Watch it over and over.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The flick has a bleak overall tone to it but should satisfy Batman fans. However I think it would be a better movie if it was stylized like Sin City. Would make for a much cooler movie.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|THis movie is good but not a great one in the the Avenger series.  I think that Mark G. did a much better job as the Hulk.  THis was packed well and arrived on time.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Already was in love with the soundtrack.  With all Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway -  what's not to love?  Also giving as a gift to my musical friends.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I love this series!! Christian Bale is my favorite Batman.  He did an excellent job, however this is the darkest movie in the series. Came on time and packed well.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds Star Wars is more challenging and the graphics are great!  I just wish I could remember what bird does what LOL.  The bad thing about it is that I cannot get it on my iphone  :(  I am addicted to angry birds!!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I played this game on my friends ipad and I REALLY like it. it can be challenging but that's what keeps you playing the game:P. the outfits are also really funny. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS GAME YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON THE FUN!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|It was tough to tell with this movie, if it was the mix of actors or the slow pieced together storyline that led to this movie being so slow at points.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The movie is good but slow getting to the main action and just when it does it ends. a to be Continued style format movie. Still a fan of the series. I will keep watching them.
B009AP2G26|5.0|The best show ever, never miss a week. The best show ever, The best show ever, never miss a week.never miss a week.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutely love this show and hope it continues for a long time. I can't wait to watch the new episodes. I had seen previews for this show many times but never gave it the time of day to watch it but when I watched season 1 episode 1 I was hooked and actually watched season 1 and 2 in a matter of weeks and then started season 3 and played catch up. Love it
B004J64QSI|5.0|The best show ever, never miss a week.The best show ever, never miss a week.The best show ever, never miss a week.
B0012GTZFC|5.0|Anyone who has &#34;big ideas&#34; is going to need a tribe to make it happen. Do you need to read tribal leadership to create such a tribe? No. Lots of people have done incredible things well before the book existed. Will you learn a lot and save yourself a lot of trouble going through trials and tribulations? Yes.<br /><br />I'm not in corporate America, don't own a company or work for one. This book is useful for anyone trying to organize anything. I'd like to see other version written where the focus isn't on corporate America. That's be cool (social movements, etc.)
B004G6009U|5.0|Tangled (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)  Enjoyed the movie all my grandbabys just loved it I can't count how many times we have watched it
B00009APK1|3.0|I had ordered the full screen edition and I was surprised to see that it was a widescreen edition instead. Everything else was good but very unhappy with the mistake that was made.
B0034G4OY0|5.0|Hereafter [Blu-ray] great movie not much to say we all enjoyed the movie we have passed it on to family they also enjoyed we did get it back Ha Ha great job
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Bought this as a surprise Christmas present for my wife (while she was wrapping)  Downloading was a snap and was a big hit.<br />Thanks Amazon
B008602KQI|4.0|I don't know if anyone else has pointed this out since I have no intention of reading over a thousand reviews, but this story seems to be an exploration of the concept in game theory taken to a very disturbing level. That is probably the point however. If you want to drive a point like this  home you don't do it with fuzzy little bunnies & nerf balls. I found the film provoking & sad but I also recognized that the story is purposefully pushing a lot of buttons which will hopefully get the viewer to think & not just react to the button pushing.  Although many other movies have done the games to the death theme, this seems to be a bit different in that we're talking children here. Why? Probably because if these were adults, we'd just think of the decent into gladiatorial games. With children, it's just not so easy to create a framework to make this struggle into an acceptable  form. I hope this makes sense & I'll try to come back when it'snot so late.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|How could I doubt that a movie with minions could be heart warming (duh!).  ;-)  The story line is very cute and the movie is wonderful.  Glad I took the time to sit down and watch it.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|A tremendous read that reaches far into the human subconscious and makes us think about who we are, and what our society is made of.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Loved the movie can't wait until they re-boot ...nice ending and well put together. I would highly recommend the movie to anyone who loves Batman.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|Looks like a good movie but could not understand most of the conservation. Picyure itself was good but audio difficult or impossible to understand
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game was the best i ever played. it is very addicting and fun to play with your free time.THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|What a fantastic show. It's one of the best dramatic series around and I can't wait to see every next episode. Buy this series if you are the least bit inclined.
B000VZV58U|5.0|Just another fantastic piece of work by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers.<br /><br />Good sound quality, great price right now, & a great album.
6304916558|5.0|I think Pierce Brosnan is a great Bond. Tomorrow Never Dies is a solid effort by the Bond film makers. Buy this DVD.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Cancer seem from the eyes of a young victim - well-written and entertaining.  Ready it quickly.  Loved the book but not exactly upbeat.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|It is an average Anderson film in it's looks, color saturation, etc. It has it's moments where the characters really make you laugh. As much as there is a decent amount of action and drama, if you aren't familiar with Anderson's film it COULD feel a little slow. Overall, I think it was a great achievement and Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, as well as the two teens, had good performances. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a quirky comedy.
B005K2XNGG|5.0|The fit is perfect and it's well put together. The great selection of fabrics are just icing on the cake. Don't hesitate, it's well worth the price.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I found Lindsey Stirling while surfing around on Youtube, starting with the dubstep-esque &#34;Crystallize&#34; and loved her infusion of dance music and violin, as well as her sunny personality. I have previously bought a couple of her tracks on itunes and when I saw that she had a full album coming out I bought it (so I could listen to it in the car - as I've got an older car that doesn't work well with my ipod). All the songs are cool especially &#34;Shadows&#34;, &#34;Trancendance&#34;, &#34;Spontaneous Me&#34;, &#34;Electric Daisy Vioilin&#34;, and the aforementioned &#34;Crystallize&#34; complete with its &#34;dubstep&#34; breaks. I'd recommend it highly...and it's only a shame that she had the misfortune to come out at a point when people don't buy albums as much. I hope she goes gold or platinum anyway.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A very interesting story about a very interesting man. Great insight to much of what made Steve Jobs tick, how his controlling genius made Apple great, and how he and others of that time shaped the tech industry of today.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I love all renewed movies, and this movie one of them! perfect animation with Teddy bear with good story and direction as well.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It is a good game I had it when it was still only samurai but the zombie edition of it needs work.... the charms are not even the zombies sword and bow does not change and the zombies forces are slow to get more but other than that good game.
B006O3MU96|1.0|I bated it to me it was to confusing. I did not know what to do. or how to do it.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I was a little leary in buying something new from Van the Man, but I'm glad I did! This reminds me of his older material from his Heyday, and a very enjoyable album.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|There is so much more to this story than what your first impression may be. I was impressed with the psychological views that kept appearing on so many levels.
B009GESJH2|5.0|This is Classic Kid Rock stuff, but not maybe his very best. Still a good album to have if you are a Kid Rock fan.
0446585041|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend's mom, who loves Ellen. I had heard great reviews on the book, so I had to get it for her. Great choice!
B00979CS50|3.0|I bought this because I've always been a neil young fan. This was a bit of a let down. Definately not one of his better works. Sounds like he threw it together to raise some money without spending a whole lot of time writing good music.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Well done and lived up to book but definitely a dark movie with a graphic violent sex scenes and not for children or teens.
B0042EJD5I|5.0|This lp is very quiet, which is a must since it has so many soft passages. Highly recommended for those looking to replace their scratched up copies (like mine was).
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I thought it was just OK. My daughter, her boyfriend and her college friends enjoyed it more than I did,
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I like everything Mark Knopfler does, so I like this album as well. I haven't really given it a lot of listening time yet, but it seems to be right in line with his other solo efforts. If you are a Knopfler music collector, add this one to your collection.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|This is a good action movie which entertained the whole way through.  Had a few interesting, perhaps even believable ideas that supported the plot.
B0086449YA|5.0|I bought this because I'm a huge fan of Mark Knopfler. Not my favorite album from him, but very good nonetheless. A must have if you are a Knopfler collector!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really love this writer. he books are excellent, funny, well written  and they get the kids reading. i strongly recommend them
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is an amazing movie, it's one of the best movies I've watched in a long time. It's funny, entertaining, and very engaging because you can't help to move to the music and clap when you like a performance.
B001706I5I|2.0|Im not sure what I was expecting, but this movie was just not very good to me.  I guess I liked the original.
B0086700CM|5.0|wow! I never thought I would like this but it is so fun and addictive. I keep telling my self next round than I am done but that never happens. great game thank you imangi studios LLC
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Take leave of your senses and roll in the barrel of fun. A mix-up of Boy Scout parody and &#34;boy-meets-girl&#34; with an ensemble cast of well-known actors supporting two less-known young actors as they run away to adventure, chase scenes, unnatural forces of nature, melodrama, romance, and fantasy on a beautiful wooded coastal island.
B009ZE27US|5.0|ok if you say its bad because  it didnt say your age then 3 words:learn to read! Its the perfect prank and i can picture it now how I am using it to guess my friends age and it says a silly number and we all start laughing. Come to reality people and read the discription.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Saw him live at the Barclays Center 11/21/12 which prompted me to buy this albumn. Best choice I made with my money. His graveled voice lyrics pushed the deep and dark side of the cuts to the front.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game had new birds and new action and new field effects that made it all more interesting and harder to get  three stars.
B00A17AD36|5.0|This is the best collection of songs from such a young man in a long time. Real music!  Love love him!!
B009X01D9U|3.0|I'm still trying to get used to this case.  Cons:  It's swivel is stiff, the case is heavy and the leather still smells a month later.<br />Pros:  It looks nice and it protects.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|This film is great. It Might Get Loud follows three well known guitarists who span three different generations of listeners. Jimmy Page introduced the world to blue-driven rock with Led Zeppelin, the Edge created sonic masterpieces in U2, and Jack White made the blues popular again in his two piece band The White Stripes. The film examines each guitarist and presents the guitar as much more than a musical instrument. Furthermore, It Might Get Loud aims to show what many guitarists believe- the guitar is not only 6 strings, it is an extension of the guitarist.<br /><br />While some may be disappointed with the lack of &#34;jamming&#34; from our three guitarists, I was happy to come away from film with more than listening to a few guys play together. However, there are some very cool moments in the film. For example, Jimmy Page starts to play Whole Lotta Love and the Edge and Jack White become in a state of stupor and amazement. Also, there's a In My Time of Dying slide guitar jam that's quite beautiful because we get to see each guitarist add their personality to the song.<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of music. It's really a gem.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I love his novelas while waiting for new novels to b released.  Harry Beaumont is one of my favorite characters.
B00ADYZTLS|3.0|Waited a looong time for this CD... Not his best work.. Every song is about how much money he has... It gets annoying...
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|was ok. not as good as i thought. not sure what i expected, but i think this kinda fell short. mila kunis is hot though.
B004DP9QFS|5.0|I am amazed by the amount of data displayed in such a simple format on the clock face.  The map and globe options have great graphics.<br />My only criticism is that length of day and length of night segments below the clock do not show properly on my Galaxy Tab.  They work fine on my Galaxy S II phone.<br /><br />Update - The developer responded almost immediately to my original review to assist with the display problem.  Everything is displaying properly now and I have revised my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  This is a great app and now I know it has great support too.
0425252868|5.0|Adam Makos has learned his trade from an early age at his grandparents knees.  Adam started out writing and producing a wonderful slick magazine called Ghost Wings (now Valor Magazine), while still in High School with his siblings and a friend, it described the war in great detail from the grandparents eyes.  They captured the content and went on to greater things like working with the infamous &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;.  Along with artist John Shaw many prints were made and signed by this band of men.  After that, they tackled the Pacific theater and have successfully completed that.  Adam has now written a wonderful book with Larry Alexander, who in his own right has produced a number of WWII books.  The story is well told and one that once started cannot be put down.  There are many stories left from this time era, but as a teacher of history and the like I can recommend this book highly.  Disregard the fact that I have known this family for a number of years through my travels with a member of the Band of Brothers and know these young people well.  Adam has a bright and most promising future as a writer and I wholeheartedly support this book.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Have seen a story on their recording of this first album.  It's a great story to go along with a very strong first album.  Hope they can follow up with another as strong in a few years.
B0098460O4|5.0|These young voices are real.  They have the most beautiful voices working together.  Young Jonathan clearly has an OUTSTANDING voice and when complimented with the beautiful Charlotte, they are very moving.  I so love the Italian lyrics.  They really let the beauty of the music selections stand out.  I assure you they work together wonderfully.  The beauty of Chalotte's friendship with Jonathan is evident in that he looks to her for some of his inner strenght to let the world hear what he has to offer with that voice.  I listen to them over and over and really never tire of the amazment of their voices together.  They may part ways one day but will never forget the friendships they formed in their youth.  I think he will go on to be one of the best performers of our age.  Another great voice in the world of singers.<br /><br />I hope you will try, and support them in their journey of stardom.  You wont be dissapointed in their offering. It's very good and I asssure you, you wont forget his voice or theirs together.
B009EANE3M|3.0|Nice album, but liked the first 2 better.  It's good, but just not as good as the first ones.  Will look forward to the next one.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci rocks...I thought I had it figured out, then the direction changed.  A thoroughly enjoyable read!  I recommend this book to anyone who likes Baldacci or mysterious!
B005NS5CX4|3.0|Liked their first two albums better, but is nice.  No real upbeat songs like previously. It's good, but just not as good as previous.
B009POCG2C|4.0|This is an enjoyable movie but a lot on the light side.  Eastwood's character is a Walt Kowalski (Gran Torino) as an aging baseball scout who doesn't drink as much.  Amy Adams was great - she definitely needs much meatier material to work with, but she was definitely the star of the show.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The Panther is a good read although it gets into a little too much detail.  At times, I felt like I was reading the same material all over again.  It also takes a while for the action to begin and just when you think its going to start, there is another lull with more background detail.  I like Nelson DeMille's writing and sarcastic humor which solicits a good laugh in what are supposedly serious situations.  After reading The Panther, I am still a Demille fan.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really fun app for all ages. My 7 year old and I fight over who gets to play. didn't think I'd like it this much!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I forget time when I play this game which is a very nice perk for me :) Definitely not difficult but I find it quite amusing and engaging. It is very easy to zoom in with the kindle fire...not sure why some of the other reviewers complained...love this game!
B001CTGQBK|3.0|I downloaded it from Amazon and only got part of the movie. It missed about 12 minutes and no matter what I did I couldn't see that part of the movie. It skipped much more than that several times but I was able to reverse it back to only missing 12 minutes or so. So this definitely interfered with my enjoyment of the movie. And it was my first Amazon downloaded movie. If it happens again I probably won't use your service again.
0977326403|5.0|Great read and real life experience.  I have recommended it so some friend in leadership and management. It made me think different.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|It is a wonderful holiday film, and I would suggest it to any family. It is delightful amd heart warming.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Joe Abercrombie is, by far, one of my favorite authors working today.  His characters are fresh, fragile and funny, not to mention frequently fearful of the dangers his world imposes.  I've always loved how his world comes alive like almost no other fantasy authors.<br />Red Country takes an interesting tack:  It combines a western with fantasy, and accomplishes both equally well.  The middle portion of the book is indistinguishable from lonesome dove in content, although a great deal funnier and fun.<br />I could go on, but ultimately, this is a must-read.  Old characters and new spring up throughout, and anyone who always wanted to know what happened to a certain nine-fingered berserker will not be dissapointed.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My grandson played with this game the entire 400-mile trip we took recently.  Great game!  Definitely held his attention all day.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive I have a lot of fun with this game on my kindle fire hd would recommend it to any one old or young
006198969X|5.0|This was perfect for me. I'm not the fashion expert and need help from my friends from time to time. She makes it plain and simple to understand.
1400082773|5.0|This book is a one of a kind.  How many other times can we see into the autobiographical past of a current sitting president; especially the past of a current president's past that shows their insecurity, self-questioning, emotional struggles, and over-all search for self-identity.  Whether or not you are an Obama fan; all Americans should read such an interesting insight into our current president.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This movie felt like it had some great promise but delivered what you would expect from a cookie cutter film.<br />Helmsworth is underutilized and Theron was hampered by this predictable script with nothing truly new.
B009HEN7LY|5.0|Men in Black 3 delivered not a let down being the 3rd movie was still funny and entertaining. Love Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones such a good team.
B0086700CM|5.0|my grandchildren told me about this game. woww. the sounds &amp; picture are good &amp; fun. it's hard too stop playing. I just love &quot;temple run&quot;. I think you will enjoy. it too
057809665X|5.0|As someone who's incredibly interested in social interaction, I was eager to add Mr. Dreeke's book to my library. I was not disappointed! Mr. Dreeke presents many easy techniques for starting conversations, complete with examples, from his own experiences during and after his stint as an FBI agent. This easy and fun read left me eager to put his pointers into practice. I'm hoping to add some highlights to my otherwise often mundane days by learning about and from others and their experiences, and perhaps even to encourage others to convince themselves to become better people using nothing more than conversation. Further, Mr. Dreeke includes his own contact information at the end of the book, and he has been quite open to discussing questions and hypothetical situations with me. I highly recommend this book.
B00931JMRE|5.0|It's ZZ Top, everything they do is awesome. Billy Gibbons is spot on as is Dusty and Frank, those guys are legends. Can't wait until the next album.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Lame plot, terrible casting.  I could not wait until the agony was over.  Clint  looked much more like a grandfather than a father.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I so enjoyed this book.  Being British by birth, and knowing many of the places Harold walked through, I could easily imagine his journey.  I think it is something many of us think of - just to walk and keep walking to sort out our problems (shades of Forest Gump) but most of us don't actually do it.  I thought the characters of Maureen and Harold were very believable and the ending was not sugary-sentimental, much more interesting.
B007MDB548|5.0|A mi hija le encanto esta película desde que la vio en el cine, ha sido hasta el momento la unica que la ha mantenido interesada por ello decidi adquirirla en BR para que la disfurte las veces que quiera. Se las recomiendo ampliamente
B000S88JTS|5.0|I watched it in the theater in the 70's it was and still is the Best motorcycle movie of all time !!!
B009369Z8A|5.0|Great movie! Looks great on the bluray. Have watched it 5 times with friends. Now they want to get it.
B00979CS50|5.0|Amazelingly, Neil Young and Krazy Horse still have the ability to make me want to listen to every note and lyric of their tunes, lengthy as they may be.  Prolific songwriter and rocker through the years, he's still &#34;got it&#34; despite his age.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Great CD. Actually every song is good. This is not true with most CD's. Good price and shipped very quickly!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford and Sons Babel is as I expected it would be-FANTASTIC; and an excellent follow-up to their debut album.  Every track is full of great lyrics, vocals and instrumentals(especially love the banjo).  Highly recommend this record to anyone tired of the same old stuff on the airwaves.  Babel is unique and will surely become a classic.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Each one of the series keeps you wanting to read the next! A well developing story line as well that keeps you wanting to know what is going to happen next.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This film was Not what I was expecting.  Film is too dark.The story was ok, but very predictable. The cast was too greasy looking.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've now read the 2nd edition. I'm not a reader per se, but this book is really good, kept me going..
B00004YRQA|5.0|Thank you so much for delivering this product. It helped me to my potential to save a lot of games.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Ease of use and clarity of information is great. Would recommend the app. to anyone. You can keep abreast of the weather conditions from wherever.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Read the book and watched the show at the same time. Really great story. I can't wait to watch season 2.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey Darker<br />Interesting reading. The plot is loaded with many twists and turns. Enjoyed reading this book. Not for the faint of heart.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|It was thought provoking<br />...which is a great thing! The author jangled nerves early in the book, but it was a well layered argument and statement overall
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Plot is interesting, some of the escapades are pretty far out. Definately not for the faint of heart. Well written.
B007THA4FI|1.0|J K Rawling should stay with Harry Potter stories. This book was an awful disappointment.  Shallow plot.  Very difficult to read and follow.  I guess if you are a Brit you might enjoy.  But any other, just a big struggle.  Don't spend the money or waist your time.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Its as good as the card game. If you don't really have time for company but like UNO it's a good game to play.
B0067R0APK|4.0|gives all the info you need  all together on one page and you can scan down 15 days a page per day
B001HNE3NO|3.0|I ejoyed the history of it but it got a little ridiculous towards the end.  Just couldnt buy how silly the woman became.
B002ZG981E|5.0|AMAZING MOVIE. such an original plot line which is rare to find and an amazing set of FX an plot.
B008KW43TE|5.0|Such a good album. One of the best of 2012. If you like old school r&b, this is a must listen.
B002UNMWAG|4.0|Not as good as the first... took them 10 years to make the 2nd... maybe that had something to do with it.. The ending plot line was good... however the last (two) scenes annoyed me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Ah, to find something as fabulous as this... Buy it, read it and enjoy. Then keep going as you will hooked on Howey.
B0091LS07E|3.0|I was disappointed in this CD. The Girl on Fire cut was disappointing because of that other rap person (cannot think of her name but see her in my mind) just ruins the song. Some of the songs are just not good. I have to skp a bunch of songs to find the good ones.
B009O07NDY|2.0|I\\"m very disappointed in this soundtrack - although, if you're going to buy it, you should get the expanded version (it includes some of the best tunes that are not on the regular version).<br /><br />It's A LOT of incidental music - random notes placed next to each other that don't really pull you in and that actually make you want to turn the music off.<br /><br />In the past, Shore had a talent for bringing in new themes and using them throughout in such a way that you really felt the uniqueness of each CD for each film and in  a way that really told the story through music. With this CD, the new themes are wonderful, but are hardly there. Shore uses way too much of the themes from the LOTR films and doesn't really capitalize on the beauty of the new themes. I blame the film for all of this, as the majority of it feels very pieced together and is missing a grand story line (well the feeling of it anyway, it is there).
B009NPA3MS|5.0|One of the best CDs I own. Each and every song is good and I don't have to skip any. So impressed with this CD; cannot wait for the second.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Not super impressed. I'm sure it works well in the film to add to the quality of the acting and such, but the sound quality with the live singing and the raw emotions instead of ballad singing just doesn't work for me when it comes to just listening to it. But there are bits where it still shines. I just hope they come out with a full length CD.
0345803485|3.0|Fifty shades and lots of fun for the shade I assume to be I wish The actual experience was more vivid .
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I have read this series many times and enjoyed it every time.  It is so easy to fall in love with these characters.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|We bought this right before it became a freebie on Amazon Prime. What a waste of money, but an excellent show!
B000QCQ970|5.0|I'm a former online winning poker player from the US, no longer free to play the top sites online, I play live in a limited events.  Lack of playing time and daily training has left me rusty to say the least.  Before I began live league play this year I decided to break my game down and re-examine my playing style and methods.  I started off well but quickly fell back into a defensive conservative comfort zone.  This is not a winning strategy and needs to once again be examined and corrected.  This book has shown me the way to revise my game and get back to being a winning player.  It has connected many dots and given me a clear plan to reboot my training methods, hone my skills and revamp my live tournament game.  Anyone competing at anything including life itself should devour the contents of this book.
1469984202|5.0|These books are the best I've read in awhile.  Setting and characters are original and incredibly interesting.  Couldn't put them down once I started, can't wait to read First Shift!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Great story and lots of action.  I wasn't expecting it to be a great movie because Shia LaBeouf was in it but it was indeed a great movie.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I'm SO GLAD they FINALLY made the DVD available! I've seen this movie a handful of times and searched periodically for the DVD and now it's FINALLY HERE and AVAILABLE for purchase. This is a truly uplifting story you will enjoy so get your copy soon as it has been near to impossible to find a DVD copy for years now! This is a truly classic movie, and I think Streisand's BEST art and performance!
B003DNN0L2|4.0|It was simply a very enjoyable movie. We got some good laughs. My husband and I would probably watch it again.
B0018QPPXW|5.0|Not a bad idea for a 16 year old.  Too bad he didn't count on being blind sided by the young lady and her boss.
B0086DBE62|4.0|Sat and watched this movie by myself. Enjoyed every single moment of it. Would definetly recomend to friends. Really good family movie.
1451695195|5.0|The doctor made the case clearly that his visions of the afterlife were not steming from some hilucinations of his brain.  In fact he decribed in convincing scientific terms that his brain was not functional at all during the time of his afterlife experience.  It was an exciting read because it brought hope for an existance beyond this life and confirmed for me that this life is one small expression of a greater purpose.
B006AX6ONI|3.0|I thought the book was a fun read for the price of the book.  It starts off strong and insightful and then ventures off into a shameless campaign on some of the businesses that Mark Cuban currently owns.  For example, I did not now until I read this book that Mark Cuban is the owner of a HD cable network.  Having said, that I am a huge fan of the Shark Tank show.  The book does provide an amble level of motivation to get out there and make your dreams come true- And party on your way to success.  Just don't go into this book thinking that it provides an answer to all of your entrepreneurial and career level ambitions.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie has become a yearly tradition in our home.  Follow the Grizwold family as they prepare for the Christmas holiday and welcome family, expected and unexpected, into their home.  The complications prove hilarious from beginning to end.  You won't want to miss a side splitting minute!<br /><br />Kathy Althouse
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|When I saw this movie when my family rented it, I was a bit skeptical but at the same time entranced by by the visuals. It does leave a lot of questions and I really wish the extra content was on a dvd instead of blu-ray. Not much I can do about that, overall great movie!
B009ZE27US|1.0|Tried my whole family on this app I'm only 14but it said I was 47. It also said my little sister who is 9 was 27.
B008K8H9C6|4.0|I love this game. It's really engaging. Great way to pass time. Challenge of the mind! I really should play this game more.
B008VBYN80|4.0|it is fun my plays it not me its a little confusing I'm kaitlyn mayor I'm 6 I don't get this game a lot bye love you merry christmas
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The original and the best. Tons of fun. Way too much enjoyment out of this, if that's even possible! I really love playing this game.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|One of the best shows currently on television, and probably one of the best shows of all time.  Excellent writing and acting, plus a story line that never bores or disappoints.
B0035G01WS|5.0|I bought this book because one of the chapters was about an Aunt of mine that has long been passed.  As I read the chapter, I laughed all the way through because you can hear that persons voice in you mind.  It was wonderful.....
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community is one of those shows that takes a few episodes to really get into, but it's so worth it!  Clever, witty humor expertely delivered by an outstanding cast.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Really enjoyed the newest book of the series.  Looking forward to the next book.  Hopefully no cliffhanger the next time.
B00AMS38YU|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  The action is great and<br />it would make a super gift for youths who enjoy<br />riding bicycles, especially BMXs, etc.  I really liked the movie.<br />The innovation of creating yellow lines to imagine the route of<br />the couriers, and the eye contact of the main character as he<br />decides which route to take before taking it was unique. Director<br />did a great job in choosing each of the actors for the movie parts also.  Again,<br />I thought it was a very good movie, innovative, different and a break from the<br />regular hum drum paces of other action movies.  I am looking forward to<br />purchasing this movie and maybe seeing a Premium Rush 2.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|Very cute story, however the soundtrack sucks. I miss the days of wonderful music like the lion king and the little mermaid.
B008K8H9C6|5.0|This game is really cool. Help Alex make a series of contraptions to manipulate an item from start to finish by building it with given items and testing it. There is an instructional part that helps you get the hang of it. My five year old loves it. This is not just a game but a way to help critical thinking skills with helps there is experimentation, cause and effect, planning and maybe even some physics principles to this game. While I certainly let him get a fix on Angry Birds, I far prefer Amazing Alex because it involves problem solving and logic.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I was not that happy with it, but my son loved it. I thought it was very formulaic, but he enjoyed it immensely.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|PHASE 1 MARVEL STILL ROCKS! a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie a lot so my opinion is surely biased, but this is not what I was expecting.<br /><br />The performances are sub-standard, and I think it goes back to the main marketing gimmick from that first trailer. All of these performances are recorded live on the set the first time. There's no quality assurance, no remixing. A lot of the songs sound like they were recorded on a sound stage and left impurified.<br /><br />In addition to that, the actors are not stage actors, they are not singers by trade. Russell Crowe sounds stiff and inexpressive, Amanda Seyfriend sounds like a whistle. Even Hugh Jackman, who's given good performances on Broadway, sounds like the whole recording experiment hindered rather than freed him. Anne Hathaway's few songs are good I guess, and the guy who does Marius is the only one who comes anywhere close to his 10th- and 25th- Les Mis Anniversary counterparts.<br /><br />IN ADDITION TO THAT, who selected these songs and why? No Little Fall of Rain? No Who Am I?<br /><br />My only hope is that a better, bigger, more well-produced (in a sound studio, please), all-inclusive soundtrack is coming out soon. Maybe they're just waiting to see how well the movie does.
B009JBZH54|5.0|BATMAN ROCKS! a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I love superhero movies, but this one was lame. I wouldn't watch it again at all or recommend it to anyone
B005IZLPMY|5.0|PHASE 1 MARVEL ROCKS! a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p
B002ZG97EC|5.0|very good movie, i saw this movie on the  cinema, I was hoping to buy on blu ray and I was able to buy Cyber ​​Monday, thank you amazon
B009K45Y62|5.0|I'm not reviewing the movie here, because obviously, it's FREAKIN EPIC!<br /><br />The Bat Cowl Limited Edition might seem a bit bigger in the marketing photos, but if you're a BatGeek like me, you would definitely want to add this epic piece of awesomeness to your Bat collection!<br /><br />It's broken, has cut marks, and white scratching marks on the top (from when Bane scratched it in the movie).<br /><br />Get it before it runs out, 'cause there are only 35,000 of them out there!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful story that's presented in a realistic and meaning manner. From the wardrobe to the set design, everything is spot on.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I Really love this entire compilation!<br />Gone, Gone, Gone is my favorite song!<br />Phillip Phillipps has a sound a lot like Dave Matthews!
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|I think this is one of Taylor Swift's best cd's. I like every song on it. When you can say that it makes it a winner.
B003VDY7XE|4.0|I learned this show is based on &#34;The Colorado Kid&#34;, a Stephen King novel. This show is set in the vein of X-Files, and Fringe, where strange unexplained events take place, and are investigated by the FBI. The lead character is herself a mystery. She was an orphan, and we discover in the 1st episode Haven may have some answers to her past. As Series' first episodes go, this one was pretty good, and I'll continue watching. I give it 4 stars for a good first effort.
B009FB3XTA|2.0|I was disappointed in this soundtrack. I would have been better off just buying the songs I liked. At least I finish the collection.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Didn't expect much from this music game, but it plays surprisingly well!<br /><br />There are many good classic Christmas songs to choose from and the game allows you to play at different difficulties to suit your skill level. The expert level can be quite challenging especially with songs that go fast and require you to play three keys at the same time (chord). The sound quality is better than average, meaning the piano sounds more like a piano and not some cheap midi sounds. The game runs smooth and looks great with fun little effects that add to the gameplay, which makes getting long combos fun. It's also rewarding to be able to hear the song play out when you finally learned how to play it.<br /><br />There is only one mode to play, which is just pick a song and play it. The songs are abbreviated versions, usually just containing a verse or two with a chorus if applicable. Each song lasts around a minute and contains an accompanying piano part that should harmonize with your notes. I wish there was a free play mode to just play around on the piano with no time limit.<br /><br />Definitely worth the price. A great way to enjoy holiday music. Works great on my Galaxy Note 2. I'm sure having a large screen is an advantage to getting better accuracy :)
B009JZPH32|4.0|This movie is awesome. I loved it. It was everything I expected it to be and definitely worth watching. if you are looking for a good movie get his one.
B006O3MU96|4.0|it's awesome because it's free (my mom won't let me by stuff with her money( I even had two buy my own kindle fire HD)) And it's fun but it can get boring. :-(
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Feels like an episode of the show it comes from. So much fun to see what Richard Castle would've written based off his experiences with Beckett.
B0047C2IIE|5.0|Bing Crosby is Bing Crosby, How can you go wrong.  These are songs we have come to associate with Christmas sung by one who can bring them to life.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|great performances - story line ok but needed to be fleshed out more. little to graphic when talking to doctor
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Well, of course decades later, the special effects are much better, and if they had gone to the original source and done a new treatment, that would be one thing - but they followed the first movie's story line very closely, only with pointless changes that weakened both the suspense and the logic. I guess they wanted to make the female characters stronger, and maximize screen time for the high-dollar female actors. And really? Colin Farrel as a super spy? Overall fail.
B009LRE040|5.0|I loved this in theaters and I love it more seeing it again. Great movie! I definitely recommend it. It is a bit long, but totally worth sitting through.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|NOW I JUST LOVE ALL OF JOAN CRAWFORD MOVIES. BUT SHE DOES A GREAT JOB IN THIS ONE.BUT ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS BUY IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF
B004W4N55C|1.0|It has been awhile since there an update and 4.0 has been out for awhile now so please fix this crash. Waste of money unless fixed.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I thought the cast was exceptional and the story very poignant and had a very satisfying conclusion.The setting was a wonderful backdrop for the story
B002VPE1AW|5.0|The animation and visual effects are amazing! I would recommend this movie to adults who like science fiction movies/stories, and who like vivid imagination.
B000002O4S|4.0|It's what my daughter requested.  Fun movies, too much foul language in the movies but the music score was good.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|A fast read but far too violent with mind searing images for young people.  And repetitive.....going through all that again with more scarifying situations to give kids bad dreams.  A real contrast to the type of adventure/with some violence in Harry Potter and even the violence in the Lord of the Rings which is mythical enough to dismiss afterwards.  Collins has a A plus for imagination but would it were directed to adults, not children. As a teacher and parent I read this to see what had kids mesmerized.  Had a hard time making myself finish....horror situations ad nauseum.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This should be the first foray into the BDSM culture for sexually unfufilled housewives instead of that other NOT BDSM thing out there right now.
B0058YPILY|5.0|also for my daughter in law as a christmas present because she loves the show and has the other seasons
B001992NUQ|5.0|Such a great movie! Ordered this and a few others for my Boyfriends Birthday, they arrived when specified, good condition, new as described! Thank you!
B003L77G6A|5.0|My husband loves big band theory and I thought I would get him the series on video so he could watch when he wants
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Beginning dragged on a bit but after that it was great. I'm happy they removed a bunch of the silly moments from Lester's version and to be honest, the comedy moments here were much better than the ones Lester did (especially Mrs. Tessmacher looking for the bathroom in the fortress of solitude). Overall, a great film I highly recommend.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|christmas present for my granddaughter who saw the movie and loved it so I thought she would like having to watch when she wants
B001GJ3BR8|5.0|A far better film than the regular version (which I still like). This one lacks a lot of the plot holes of the original and even adds a subplot that makes the ending better
1451695195|5.0|Finally, a book that brings science & faith together, by considering questions we all have about life after death.  So well written, & accessible that most anyone can follow Dr. Alexander's incredible journey.  Not only does the book deal with the afterlife, but it also addresses our lives here & now.  I recommend it for anyone who wishes to explore the unknown.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I think this album it's better than the second one. I buy this CD on black friday, so it was a good price (6$). If you like Maroon 5 fan buy this album you gonna like it!
0802473156|5.0|Read half the book in one night. Very interesting and it changed the way I talked to my spouse. It does work you just have to practice it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I get to play with different people and we each get to express our self's. It is fun to guess what has been drawn
B00004R99J|5.0|My granddaughter and I love to watch this movie together. We laugh so much at Flint and meko.<br />It was in excellent condition.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love love love this book. Love Nicholas sparks and every literature of his out there. What a touching and inspirational novel. Truly an unforgettable read.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Got it in no time. The box is in good shape for a used item. It is a Christmas present so I have not watched it yet.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I do not read book immediately upon receipt. I have at least 30 books yet to read.<br />I'm basing my rating on the first 60 pages I have read.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|does not do what I anticipated, so would like to return it I have the Kindle Fire and no the HD
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|You want more words. This seems like really sucking whatever out of us. I find this annoying. I hope I have 18 words now so I can submit this. In the future, I won't respond to much.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I felt like I was along for the missions. It just drew you into the excitement and danger that these heroes consider their day to day job.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Cool game. Very addictive. Angry Birds Free is an awsome game. I would highly reccomend it to my friends and family!
B000FA675C|4.0|A good read.  Subject matter not conducive to all aspects of the various religions of the world but, a interesting topic to be discussed.
B0086700CM|3.0|it kept on freezing on me and I died so many times when I shouldn't have died .but other that it was okay
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Awesome! Would recommend it. Already almost half way done with the third book! Speaking of.... gotta get back to it now. Enjoy!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I read all of Ken Folletts books and usually love them.  This is no exception except it took me a little longer to get hooked.  I'm half way through it now and I'm hooked.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|It was interesting until the ending ruined it. I just read it to see the end after the second books disappointment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hard to put down can not wait to read the next one. Worth the 5 bucks, I am hooked. Next the movie
B00413QB5A|3.0|To be honest, I haven't read the entire book. What I've read of it so far seems to be pretty good. At least it has captured my reading attention. The problem I *DO* have with this book is the formatting for Kindle. It is horrible to say the least; to the point where it is quite distracting. It appears that they converted from a printed book, ran it through a spell checker and never looked at the final file. Lead quote marks are backward, as are apostrophes, contractions break across two lines. Nit-picks, I know. But really, they could have at least looked at the final product before releasing it.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|touch interface works great and actually is an imporvment on the original. on a tablet there are a few times where i was reaching with a finger but the touch interface works great and the rest is just like the ds  remake.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Hugh Jackman sounds great, as does Anne Hathaway and some of the others.  Russell Crowe sounds fine as the mean Javert, even though everyone wants to complain that he's not a singer.  Well, neither was Rex Harrison when he made My Fair Lady, and it's a classic.  I think this movie will be too.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Some parts were bland. But most of this movie is just what I expected. Not much storyline, but this is fromc reator of family guy! He doesn't need super solid storylines to be funny. It is just for enjoyment, Great movie I suggest watching it. It would also be much more enjoyable if you were swag hittin the you-know-what (wink wink, COUGH COUGH) lol, so definitely watch this movie.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I have never owned an automatic watch....pleasantly surprised with this purchase...... just wrap it around your wrist and you will be sold..... very masculine, nice weight, and winds itself as you move your wrist writing, working with your hands.... I expect many years of service from this watch...pure quality makes this time piece a pleasure not only to look at, but to wear.......
B003MX8RJS|5.0|The broad satire and George Carline-like razor sharp wit in this movie makes it very enjoyable. Sarcasm, and pure logical reasoning within this movie. Amazing acting. I saw this movie awhile ago and it was definitely worth renting again. WATCH THIS MOVIE! It is an incredible performance by all actors (Katie Holmes is kind of annoying and very...bitchy), but the rest fo the cast is excellent. WITTY, smart, and to-the-point. This movie takes swings at the current political regimines of the U.S. I LOVE IT!
B00340ESIS|5.0|This book helped me with my novel. It changed the way I plotted my books. Highly recommended especially dor us plotters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read the entire triolgy. I first I had mix emotions when I started to read it, so I did more interest in the characters than the story it self. Thank you Jackie
B004P2HMNM|5.0|My 13 year old put this together on his own.  Working on it in his spare time it took a week or two.  He had fun doing it and it looks amazing.  We will be collecting more in the series.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|What can I say about a movie that glorifies ritual child sacrifice? It's horrible. As far as cinematography goes, it was okay. So, with the modern cinematographers' technique of the shakie-and-whirling-camera, The Hunger Games falls dramatically short of qualifiying as a movie worth wasting two hours of your life on. Drivvle and poppy-cock! SPOILER ALERT: They change the rules of the game at the end then change them back then change them back again when the kids were going to both commit suicide. I'll let you watch this piece of cinematographic programming to figure out which two characters live
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The movie is full of old action movie actors and is an enjoyable, fun flick.<br />Some computer animation which, in my opinion, takes away from the movie.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|It's amazing!!!!!!!!!!  Love that Emeli sound! I heard about her through an Alicia Keys song and I'm so glad I did! I've turned her sound on to others and they also love her. This cd is perfection!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|HOPELESS is another fantastic book by Colleen Hoover. It is heart wrenching at times and heartwarming at others. Holder and Sky are kindred spirits and I adore them both. This story is emotionally raw and painfully beautiful...an absolute must read!!!
B0091LS07E|5.0|She did it again! But, I'm an Alicia fan so, don't listen to me! I wasn't sure if I was going to like it because I hadn't heard anything about it from others..but, when I played it..I was reminded why I love Alicia Keys! She has definitely matured and her voice and lyrics are a testament that life is in a great place for her. You can't help but be happy for someone who sounds so happy and certain about what she wants and who she is! Love it!! :)
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Its worth it but its very expensive for what you get its very small and not that much in it.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|We all know this cd was one of his best! Love me some Kanye! He brings it every tme and I thank him for it!
B008I3R2VG|5.0|I thought I was reviewing this new album but I places the review in the single above. In any case this was well woth the purchase if you enjoy The Killers
B006O3MU96|4.0|Finally it is free! I have been waiting for this, but didn't want to spend a 1$. I was right a don't think it is worth a 1$. I mean it is a good game the only problem I have with it is that when you try to exit the game it has that same thing that bugs me are you sure you want to exit. that just drives me crazy. Oh well good app
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I resisted seeing this movie because I figured it was boring.  No real action.  Wrong!  It was wonderfully written with witty dialogue.  The scenery of Paris is captivating.  And the historical characters are so charming.  Loved it.
B0045XKJBI|4.0|The movie was actually better than the book. Great action scenes. Great special effects. Great casting. A difficult but good achievement. Purchased through amazon.com to own \\"forever \\".
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun! could play all day long!!! People of all ages will love this game. Always more to win!!!
B00824ZJ84|5.0|Not only does this lady have an absolutely amazing voice her lyrics are phenomenal. Is not often in today's music industry then we are blessed with talent and meaningful lyrics. This is 1 of the best albums I've heard in quite some time. This is not your bubble gum drop it like its hot music CD. This album is for the true music lover.
0345803507|4.0|Was great ending....I could not put the books down...sexy, erotic and kept you wanting to turn pages.  I wish there was more books like this but urban books
B009YMLT7I|5.0|Beautiful movie - the sort that comes along only once in a while.  It draws you into it, it's pace, it's narrative, which is conceptual at times.  Every shot, every frame, is considered.  A work of art.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I finished the book last week and loved it. It is very well researched and written in an easily digested style. The breakdown of the book lets the reader skip through the chapters with ease. The book offers valuable and fun information. I highly recommend it.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|very different story, but the jokes got tired very fast.  I soon lost interest and watched it from the back forward.
B00190OHD6|5.0|A wonderful love story, sprinkled with self fulfillment. The movie not only focuses on romantic love, but also on motherly, sisterly love as well as friendship.  Funny, touching, a little gem with great actors..  Especially Hillary Swank.  Carpe diem and carpe the ones you love.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Related by a MD who did not believe in non-scientific matters at all.  His trip to Heaven made him a believer and an advocate for spirituality.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|Just recently discovered Grimes and instantly fell in love.  In a veritable ocean of mediocre music, Grimes provides an island paradise.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I just installed this app and it only loads a very limited portion of the news feed. This app needs an update
159562015X|2.0|The book<br />The book does well in explaining how society takes such a strong focus on fixing weakness that we loose out on working with our natural talent turned into strengths. To paraphrase an analogy I have used over the years: You can't teach a dog to meow or a cat to bark; but you can teach a dog tricks or a cat to meow for food. The book is easy to read and helpful, but incomplete in my view.<br /><br />The assessment<br />Before doing the assessment, I reviewed the items and determined and ranked the top 10 that applied to me. After doing the assessment I compared the results and found that only 3 of my top ten were in the top 5 results. What is interesting my number one showed as the assessed number one. But it is not clear that the strengths are ranked. 2 of the assessed results are way off base - in fact really weak areas: in one case it is a weakness often pointed out by friends. Would have been better to give a ranking of all talents in the assessment with some kind of strength indicator so that one can tell if talent 1 is an outlier - i.e. very strong compared to 2-7 all being the same value i.e. showing only 1-5 doesn't tell you if the next non-displayed ones are just as strong as numbers 3-5.<br /><br />I did the assessment on an iPad and was never sure whether it took my response or not, sometimes it just seemed to move on to the next after the 20 seconds. Did not instill confidence that my assessments were recorded.<br /><br />The methodology<br />The book and assessment seems incomplete since it has gaps: it does not identify creative talents; mostly has a corporation bias, missing out on talents found in designers and artists. To go back to my analogy, it only talks about dog talents, but none for cats. In other words the book is based on successful people by their definition. Einstein's talents were probably counted, while Picasso's were not.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One day, my teacher told me about Wonder and encouraged me to read it. I read the first sentence and automatically got sucked  into it. I hope you like this book as much as I did!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie - it's funny (Rebel Wilson!) and the music is great!  The cast really works as an ensemble - and the best part is, they don't take themselves too seriously.  Highly recommend!
B00136Q4P0|5.0|Absolutely worth every penny. Probably the best compilation of songs by the late great MJ. RIP MJ. You will be missed.
B003XRELEI|1.0|This book was highly recommended by a coworker.  As a result, I subsequently really question this person's credibility.  This is one of the most pointless, self-indulgent, absolutely unnecessary books I've ever read.  Before buying, read the prologue - Vonnegut didn't even want to write this book!  Take Vonnegut's own advice and don't bother reading this senseless prose.  It was written &#34;to clear (his) head of all the mental junk that had piled up in 50 years of living on planet Earth&#34; at the time of writing.  Rated 1 star because I couldn't rate it zero...
B009WO7NQO|4.0|it is cool, but it is angry birds again. No new surprises really. Worth the purchase if you love angry birds
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Seth McFarlane has done a great job with Family Guy. Unfortunately, a feature length movie needs more than a 30 minute plot. Ted is a one trick pony that drags on.
B004C3DLJS|4.0|Kids loved this movie.  3 year old and 7 year old, kept them captivated most of the time.<br /><br />Streaming worked well to Roku player, no issues.  Quality was nice.
B001I10ABE|5.0|I don't get what other reviewers are complaining about with regards to Nothing Else Matters. The whole set sounds simply amazing, I'm hearing subtle nuances that I never ever heard listening to this on CD, which I did an awful lot back in the day (my CD was very very well worn).  This may not be your favourite Metallica album, it isn't mine.  But there are some great songs on here, and I doubt you will ever hear them sound better.  I'm going to pick up the rest of the preceding 4 albums in this format too, to see if they sound as good as this.  For me, they got pretty average after that, so will leave Load and the rest well alone.  Be interesting to see if they can make Justice sound a little less stale, and dying to hear MOP (my favourite LP) remastered to similar quality.
B005LAIGYQ|3.0|While I appreciate our men at arms and would never denigrate their work, the fact that actual Navy Seals were used in this drama diminished the quality.  Ok story and ok acting.  Not something to get excited about.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I rename this movie, \\"Slow Death to All Men\\".<br /><br />And why do women force us to watch this stuff??  And giggle at our obvious pain and discomfort??
B006LSZECO|3.0|Any suggestions about the plotline of this story would give it away - and the plot is what makes this read-worthy. It is well-written and an interesting look at couplehood. The idea of having the two main ,,characters write alternating chapters is a good one... I'm just not sure about where it heads and the ending. But I was caught up in the story, for sure.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my Grandchildren and has not been opened yet.  However, I know they will enjoy it
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a writer. This book is full of surprises, twists & turns. It ends up being profoundly about human<br />nature in extremist!!!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my Grandchildren and has not been opened yet. However I know they will enjoy it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is awesome for kids ages 5-12. I'm 11 and I love this game. I am an animal lover! well I hope you like the game! :)
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A Tom Clancy novel with Jack Jr. and the boys striking again for world civilization.  The book is very up to date with all the cyber crime and spying going on in the world.
B006O3MU96|5.0|This is not the same as the Christmas theme on Doodle Jump. It is a new game. I like DJ, and this is a good twist. Fun for CHRISTmas.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I like how this show treats each season like a mini-series of different ghost stories. I can't wait for the new episodes and hopefully more seasons to come.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Though not as good as PC game, it still worms amazing and is amazing on my kindle fire! Like mentioned in an earlier review creative needs water,  lava, spawning of animals and so on.
B005LAII8K|1.0|This is a sloppy-thinker's time travel movie. It is not for the more sophisticated sci-fi fan. Contradictions and silliness abound. Characters are both dead and alive at the same time. They have arms and don't have arms at the same time. We learn later in the film, for example, that the lead character kills himself as a young man but he also makes it into old age (and performs acts such as saving an even younger version of himself from certain death). Characters fear their imminent death yet also know they survive into old age. There are so many other silly contradictions and lazy, hackneyed plot devices that I couldn't enjoy any of the action scenes or other aspects of the film (which now I think about also were rather substandard). It's written by someone who clearly don't have any clear, original ideas (actually it faces many of the contradictory time travel plot scenarios as the Back To the Future movies).<br /><br />Those who can hold a complex, logical thought or two in their heads will likely be disappointed by this movie and maybe even feel a little insulted by the laziness of the screenwriter. For good time travel flicks with consistent, interesting plots, I suggests 12 Monkeys (involving a consistent causal loop) and Source Code (a consistent forking scenario).
0812993357|5.0|I am half way through and love this gook I enjoy reading about real people and Grace is real and I mean real she does such beautiful layouts for Vogue Magazine...Ana Wintour is very lucky tp have her on the periodical...Rosanne Bianchi
B002APU580|5.0|I'm a lifetime Austen fan and this is my all time favorite adaption of Pride and Predjudice. Each character was perfectly cast, each detail was perfectly executed. The entire movie is sheer entertainment.
