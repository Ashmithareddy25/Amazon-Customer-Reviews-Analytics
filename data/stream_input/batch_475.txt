1593080719|5.0|Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece..

0790730960|5.0|I love this movie. I feel that this movie was very under appreciated. The character performances were beautifully illustrated by the actors. It's as though they're real people. I loved the depth and complexity of the characters. I especially enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman. Catwoman was played with so much finesse. There were so many sides to this character and they were all played so wonderfully. The performances of Batman, Max Shreck, and the Penguin are also played with great strength. I also enjoyed the visuals and the score that the movie offered. Tim Burton is a brilliant and creative artist. I also loved the music. Danny Elfman is one of the most brilliant composers I've ever had the opportunity to listen to. This movie is so extraordinary. I commend everyone who put their time and effort into making this movie.
B00000E5HJ|5.0|After the unfortunate departure of John Cale, the Velvet Underground had a musical revamp -- their third album, \\"The Velvet Underground\\" is smoother and less gritty. Stripped of the shock value, the best of the Velvet Underground shines through -- great musical skills and beautiful songwriting.<br /><br />That change is evident from the very start, \\"Candy Says,\\" which is sort of the musical musings of transsexual Candy Darling. Rather than playing this for shock value, the way the Velvets did earlier -- see songs like \\"Heroin\\" and \\"Venus in Furs\\" -- it's soft, sweet and a bit poignant, ending with \\"Maybe when I'm older/What do you think I'd see/If I could walk away from me.\\"<br /><br />That mellower tone sets the stage for the rest of the album, which relies on poetic lyrics and strong music -- they no longer sing about S&M and drugs, but about self-examination and redemtpion. The Velvets' rock sound is less jagged and more laid-back, and they even take a foray into twangy country music in \\"Some Kinda Love.\\"<br /><br />A few songs hint at the earlier work that the Velvets did, with tambourines and blurred, high vocals from Lou Reed. But can you imagine the Velvet Underground, in their first album, ever singing a non-satirical song about Jesus Christ, as they do in one haunting ballad on here? I certainly can't, and it seems to be a part of the pensive, self-examining mood that permeates this album.<br /><br />The one exception is \\"The Murder Mystery.\\" It's literally impossible to understand the \\"right voice\\" and \\"left voice\\" speaking in this song. It's interesting, but completely unintelligible. However, this is amply made up for in the mature instrumentation and lyrics; while Doug Yule was not as great as John Cale, he does a good job with the organ. The fuzzy edge of Velvet Underground rock is retained, while they branched out into ethereal ballads and pretty acoustic songs.<br /><br />Reed's lyrics betray a greater maturity, and maybe greater poignancy. \\"One minute born, one minute doomed,/One minute up, one minute down/What goes on in your mind?\\" he ponders at the start of the album. He sings some of the songs, sounding surprisingly melodic, since his voice was kind of creaky; on the other hand, Moe Tucker provides some fair vocals for songs like \\"After Hours.\\"<br /><br />The Velvet Underground hit another peak in their self-titled album. Softer, more thoughtful, this shows them off at their best, and is definitely worth checking out.poignancy. \\"One minute born, one minute doomed,/One minute up, one minute down/What goes on in your mind?\\" he ponders at the start of the album.

B00005NEUF|4.0|Media hype follows the Strokes like a hungry dog. But with its classic-inspired uptown-grit rock, it's undeniable that while they aren't exactly the saviors of modern rock'n'roll, they are a solid and enjoyable chunk of it. \\"Is This It\\" offers the answer to its own drawled question -- this is it, and it is worth checking out.<br /><br />A pounding rhythm and several variations of the question \\"Is this it?\\" kick off the title track, a swaying rock melody. Following it are a catchy, gritty collection of lo-fi rockers. The uniquely-named Julian Casablancas drones in a delicious monotone through the fast-moving \\"Barely Legal,\\" the uneasy \\"Leave Me Alone,\\" the deceptively simple-sounding \\"Last Night,\\" and the skipping percussion of \\"Hard to Explain.\\"<br /><br />Expect to hear echoes of legendary bands like the Velvet Underground, the Stooges and Television. However, the Strokes give this retro sound a twenty-first century twist of New Yorker ennui and art-rock underpinnings. And a lot of attitude. A lot of good rock is half swagger, and the Strokes have their sneery swagger down to a minor art form.<br /><br />Due to the lavish praise heaped on the Strokes, they've become a love-'em-or-hate-'em phenomena. But just ignoring the hype and listening to the music works best -- it shows off their energetic style in full. Okay, they are not groundbreakers -- but at least they scuff the ground that has already been trodden.<br /><br />Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond's complex guitar riffs are the gems of this album -- they drone, they skip, they reverberate, and they sear. Nikolai Fraiture's bass is a good dark edge, and Fabrizo Moretti's drumming sounds like little strikes of lighting -- fast, sharp and completely out of the blue.<br /><br />Julian Casablancas has now become the reference point for male singers who sing in a bored monotone, as if too jaded to show emotion in a song. The only time he breaks out of it is in \\"Barely Legal,\\" where he almost sounds excited at times. \\"I wanna steal your innocence/To me my life it don't make sense,\\" he says, and sounds like he means it.<br /><br />The Strokes are far from being the saviors of rock'n'roll. But their punk-tinged New Yawker rock is still some pretty good music, and \\"Is This It\\" remains a likable if spotty debut.my life it don't make sense,\\" he says, and sounds like he means it.

B0007GADZO|3.0|First of all, I have to say the tracklisting on cdnow's website is different than the one on the cd.  What's up with that?  Now on to the music.  The first track is a nice way to start off the album.  Track 2 however slows down too much to where I just skip it after a couple minutes listening.  Freakshow really shows what Vai can do...probably my favorite track...need more like that.  I agree while Lotus is good, it's not great.  The album could've ended a little stronger as well.  Kind of weak to end with.  Overall, I would say it is worth picking up if you're already a fan but not good if you're just discovering Vai.
B00029CWRS|4.0|British mope-rock is alive and well, as Brit-pop trio Keane makes their debut with \\"Hopes and Fears.\\" Strong, soaring vocals from Tom Chaplin are backed up by some solid piano-based pop and rock. Despite constant comparisons to Radiohead, Travis and Coldplay, Keane shows plenty of promise as a unique new band.<br /><br />It starts off with a strong piano solo in the quiet \\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" followed by a stream of catchy pop like the thoughtful \\"Everybody's Changing\\" and the shimmery \\"Bend And Break,\\" and gossamer ballads like the melancholy \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\" and soaring \\"She Has No Time.\\" It wraps up on a strong note with the plaintive \\"Bedshaped.\\"<br /><br />If any British band breaks the rock mold, it seems to be labelled as a Radiohead/Coldplay wannabe. On some superficial levels, Keane sounds rather like those bands. But it manages to remain a bit apart, rocking a bit harder and sounding a bit more straightforward and simple. It's hard to truly classify Keane as really being pop -- the lack of guitar and the prevailing piano seem to edge its catchy melodies closer to classical pop.<br /><br />The first thing to know about Keane is: No guitarist. At all. Ever. Don't let it scare you -- the mix of rippling piano and gentle percussion are enough to make their melodies catchy without electric riffs. At the same time, they take some musical risks. Psychedelic piano-pop? Believe it or not, Keane does that.<br /><br />Tom Chaplin's vocals are the strongest point of Keane's lineup; his solid, high soars along with the shimmery music. At times his vocals get a bit TOO high, like when he sings the title line of \\"She Has No Time,\\" but most of the time he manages to sound like a heartbroken guy exorcising his breakup demons. The songs themselves aren't terribly complex or insightful, but they can be quite poignant: \\"And if you have a minute why don't we go/talk about it somewhere only we know?/This could be the end of everything/so why don't we go/somewhere only we know?\\"<br /><br />Keane needs to distance itself more from the other Brit-mope-rock bands before it can blossom into true greatness. But in \\"Hopes And Fears,\\" they have succeeded in the basics: bringing forth some beautiful, sometimes heartrending music.don't we go/somewhere only we know?\\"  <br />  <br />Keane needs to distance itself more from the other Brit-mope-rock bands before it can blossom into true greatness.

B000068CNX|5.0|Friends- The Complete Second Season is GREAT! It is full of lots of great extras. I especially liked the tour of Rachel and Monica's apartment. The trivia was easy! <br /> <br />I liked this season becasue Ross and Rachel finally got together! I mean it had to happen and I think the writers did it very well. I had many favorite episodes but I think that \\"The One Where Ross Finds Out\\" is the best.

B000002LVB|4.0|There's no point at all in introducing the Velvet Underground -- really, the first edgy alt-rock band in the world doesn't need it. And \\"Loaded,\\" while not the best album of their career, is a solid (if slightly passionless) example of Lou Reed and the Velvets rockin' out.<br /><br />The sound is bright and chirrupy, despite the downbeat tone of the songwriting (\\"You're over the hill right now, and you're looking for love\\"), opening with an oxymoron -- bright music, and songwriting like \\"Who loves the sun/Who cares that it makes plants grow/Who cares what it does/Since you broke my heart.\\"<br /><br />With that strong track as a springboard, Reed and Co. launch into dreamy pop, country-rock and strong rock'n'roll (also the name of one song). Most of them are amazing, from the eerie reverb to the shattering riffs. However, \\"Loaded\\" suffers from a few too many country-ish rockers, including \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" which is the most annoying song that the Velvets ever produced.<br /><br />The fact that \\"Loaded\\" has good songs at all is especially amazing when you consider that the band was cracking all around. Many major members -- John Cale, for one -- were gone, and the inspiration was waning. But they managed to compile a solid swan song, before fading off into rock legend land.<br /><br />It's a solid effort. With the departure of Cale, Lou Reed was the main songwriter, and his talents are evident in most songs here, but he seems to have lost a certain tightness in his work -- some of the songs ramble a little. He doesn't push any boundaries or write anything terribly wrenching, but the songs are well-written.<br /><br />Musically, Reed could not be faulted; he does some truly brilliant work near the beginning. Unfortunately Billy Yule, the brother of bassist Doug Yule, does only passable drumming. He's not bad, but he makes these songs sound rather generic. That only adds to the rather passionless, if pleasant, tone of the music.<br /><br />\\"Loaded\\" would have been considered a very good album if it had not come after the genius of the Velvet Underground's past work. As it is, it is a weaker effort, but still worth hearing.ould have been considered a very good album if it had not come after the genius of the Velvet Underground's past work.

But he's the ultimate Nirvana Drummer. Imagine what bleach would had sound like, if they already had him on board.
B00004UEFJ|4.0|Heroin, sadomasochism, paranoia, hangovers, seductive ladies and a big banana on the cover. The Velvet Underground was unique in 1967 -- even if it never made big sales -- and remains unique to this day, no matter how many bands are influenced by them. (Not bad for an arty band!)<br /><br />Lou Reed tears through a variety of songs, ranging from gritty hard rock to strange ballads. The most memorable song here is undoubtedly slashing, exotic S/M ode \\"Venus in Furs\\" (\\"Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him/Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart\\"). Elsewhere, he dips into pure rock in the desperate \\"Run, Run, Run,\\" but takes a softer turn with surreal junkie ballads and the eerie, soft \\"Sunday Morning.\\"<br /><br />However, German ex-model Nico -- who departed the band in hazy circumstances after this album -- leads with her seductive monotone. She only had a handful of songs, but they remain some of the best: singsong \\"Femme Fatale,\\" steady and slow \\"All Tomorrow's Parties,\\" and the exquisite ballad \\"I'll Be Your Mirror.\\"<br /><br />The music isn't complex, but it is strangely compelling (such as the wiggling guitar at the beginning of \\"Black Angel's Death Song,\\" or the tambourines in Nico's songs). Nowhere else could musical compositions like \\"Sunday Morning\\" (the tune originally reminded me of a music box) seem so haunting as they do here.<br /><br />The vocals are excellent, although listeners will probably like one or the other. Lou Reed's high thin voice is a sharp contrast to Nico's accented, husky croon. (Nico left the band after this album) The writing is outstanding, especially since the frank references to kinky sex and drugs are nowhere near as shocking now as they were when the album was first put out.<br /><br />The sparse, slithering music and excellent singing add solidarity to the reputation of the Velvet Underground as a classic. Dark and brooding, debut album \\"Velvet Underground and Nico\\" is an exceptional album.
B0000636UN|3.0|Each Sheryl Crow album, except TNMC has coincided with a major event in my life. There has been at least one song on each CD that kind of \\"sums up\\" the connection between the event and the CD. <br />Sheryl Crow came out right as I was laid off from a job I loved for almost 5 years, and \\"Change\\" was the positive anthem that helped me decide to go back to college and finish my degree. The Globe Sessions(my personal favorite) came out just as I gradutated (at the ripe old age of 30) and ended a relationship of 12 years. \\"My Favorite Mistake\\", \\"Anything But Down\\" and \\"Am I Getting Through\\" took care of the relationship connection and \\"There Goes The Neighborhood\\" was the celebration song. <br />A few years later, shortly after the release of C'Mon, C'Mon, my dad passed away suddenly of a heart attack. It sounds like Sheryl and I were in a similar place. Anguished, erratic and unfocused. Moments of emotional clarity and stability surrounded by an awkward confusion. Mainly, this album displays a relative numbness and empty feeling. Other than \\"Abilene\\" and \\"Lucky Kid\\", the rockers sound shallow and forced. The introspective songs are the ones that sound like Sheryl is still trying. \\"Diamond Road\\" is like a message from my dad and \\"Weather Channel\\" is emotionally stark and easily the best song on the album. It is an amazingly plain spoken account of a depressive episode an saves the album from being disposable. <br />The few songs that do work on this collection are worth the price of the cd. I can forgive Sheryl for stumbling through filler like \\"You're An Original\\", \\"It's So Easy\\" and \\"Over You\\", especially if she really was in the same horrible place I was at the time. The two new tracks on the Greatest package show that she should be returning to her old self.....I'm ready. <br />

B00025LEGW|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins created a sprawling, rich rock masterpiece with \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\" They also created a lot of songs that didn't make it to the final cut, but ended up being attached to the singles as a series of EPs. \\"The Aeroplane Flies High\\" collects those five EPs together, and creates a B-side/single collection that is well worth having.<br /><br />The first song on each disc is a song from the \\"Mellon Collie\\" double album, but the five or six songs that come after each single are unique to the EPs, originally from various recording sessions. These songs are often as good as -- sometimes even better -- than what did make it onto the albums.<br /><br />Each EP has its own mood, and its own self-contained flow, keeping the B-sides from feeling tacked on. One is hard and angry, one is bitter, one is soft and sweet, one is feel good, and so on. As a result, the full range of what the Pumpkins were able to do -- rock, pop, metal, ballads and experimental -- got put on full display, in all their glory.<br /><br />For example, in the \\"1979\\" disc, the Pumpkins get to explore their alt-pop side, while the \\"Zero\\" disc explores bitterness and loneliness, sticking to their hard-rock sound. Not to mention the orchestral/acoustic flavor of the \\"Tonight Tonight\\" EP, with its subtle strings and laments, and a lo-fi reprise of the title song.<br /><br />But there is no lag in quality, just because the B-sides didn't make it to the final cut of \\"Mellon Collie.\\" Songs like \\"The Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left, Looks Right)\\" prove that Pumpkins B-sides are still exceptional, including covers of bands like Blondie and the Cars (yes, that IS Blondie's \\"Dreaming\\" you hear Corgan singing, strange as it is).<br /><br />The heart of the Smashing Pumpkins was Billy Corgan, and Corgan's talents shine in most of the songs here. He delves into orchestras, distortion, lo-fi acoustics and jazz, all in the name of experimentation. Corgan's complex songwriting resembles poetry set to music, and his high, slightly offbeat vocals seem well-suited to the songs he sings. James Iha also wrote and sang a bit on these collections, including a pretty duet with Nina Gordon of Veruca Salt.<br /><br />If fans have the EPs already, then they will already have the content of \\"The Aeroplane Flies High.\\" But if they don't, this exceptional collection is definitely worth getting and keeping.

0767830555|5.0|This is that one movie,that no matter where I am or what I'm doing, if it's on I'm sitting down to watch it even if I catch it in the middle.<br /><br /> A very young, cut and delicious Robert DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a twenty-six year old man out of the service, who is riddled with lonliness and sleeplessness. His mind is constantly realing with the disgust and filth that's rampaging the streets of New York with prostitution, drugs, pornography and physical trash. So he decides to place himself in the very middle of it by taking up a job as a cab driver, working day and night since he can't sleep anyway.<br /><br />Constantly dissapointed whenever he believes there to be any goodness left, Travis is a man who decides he's not going to take it anymore. What I find most interesting is his fascination with all that he detests. For instance he is sick of the hookers and pimps smoothering the streets, yet he regularly visits X-rated movies with this child-like naivness. Is he fueling his rage, filling the void of human contact, is this some sort of self loathing punishment or is he the \\"walking contradiction\\"?<br /><br /> All Travis really wants (and perhaps it's his dissapointment after fighting in the Vietnam war and comming back to a life like this, without the respect or the quality of life he feels he deserves for being a soldier, which many vetrans were faced with) is to protect something that is worth protecting and to seperate himself from the filth that traps him. So he becomes the self appointed angel to a twelve and a half year old runaway hooker named Iris (played by Jodie Foster). To become reconized as the hero he may have been in the war (noticethe scars on his back during the excerise scene) which leads him into this horrific descent into hell.<br /><br />I've also heard some dissapointment reguarding the color quality of this release. I'm glad it was left untouched. I feel it adds to the atmosphere of the seedy, gritty, raw streets of seventies New York City. It makes the hairs on my neck stand up. The slow dance into the final meltdown is taped on what looks like greasy film, sickening like Travis' enviorment. The final grisely scene where the camera floats over the hallway littered with guns and bodies, blood and dirt in every corner is tinged with this reddish-pinkish hugh, which (not sure if this was intended) gives the illusion that even the air is soaked in blood. I feel this is completey suiting.<br /><br />This is an extremely intense, phsycological movie and one worth adding to any movie buff's collection.my neck stand up.

If you are a fan of traditional country, blues, or just great pickin'... there is no better from what I've heard in the past 30 years.  Just pure, not over-commercialized music, with great melody and unbeleivable guitar playing.  But what else would you expect from some of the best guitarists around... (Atkins, Knopfler, and Wariner). <br /> <br />Definite must have for any music fan.

B000000IW9|5.0|Appetite For Destruction is an excellent album and easily one of the Top 3 from the 80's but Use Your Illusion II makes it look vastly overrated.  Compare the fury of &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot; with &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; which everyone knows was in AHHHNOLD'S Terminator: Judgment Day.  Or how about the 9+ minute epic Estranged which alone makes Use Your Illusion II a five star album.  Slash's guitar for 4 minutes, then a change wear Axl plays beautifully on the piano, then more of Slash's guitar and then a thrilling finish.  &quot;Knockin On Heaven's Door&quot; was a great Bob Dylan cover and &quot;Civil War&quot; displays Axl's talent for songwriting when he avoids profanity. &quot;14 Years&quot; has a cool chorus with Izzy doing vocals and &quot;Yesterdays&quot; is one of the band's better known songs. Use Your Illusion II is above Use Your Illusion I because it's more consistent and there's less filler.  Like everyone else, my only complaint is &quot;My World&quot; which really isn't saying much because it's only 1 minute-22 seconds long although it's still Guns N Roses worst song ever.  This CD overall is probably my favorite of the 90's although &quot;90's&quot; refers only up to 1993 in my book because things went downhill fast afterward.  Use Your Illusion II is classic Guns N Roses and should no be missed by anyone.<br />Also check out these early 90's CD's:<BR>Metallica - Metallica (1991)<BR>Alice In Chains - Dirt (1992)<BR>Pearl Jam - Ten (1991)<BR>Nirvana - In Utero (1993)<BR>Guns N Roses - Use Your Illusion I (1991)<BR>Nirvana - Nevermind (1991)
068987474X|2.0|Chances are, if you're buying this book, you know that it only pertains to dating.  Well, maybe.  The title suggests that, but the subtitle \\"The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys\\" oversimplifies the \\"understanding guys\\" it's really about.  If you're looking for a book about men in general, this book is not for you.  If you're confused by dating, then read on.    Most importantly, however, this book is not the end-all guide to understanding guys, not in the least sense.  Sure, it's probably hit the nail on the head in describing a decent amount of men, but to make the assumptions that the writers make and apply them to all men (as the writers state that they do) is a flat-out mistake.    I should mention that I am a fan of Sex in the City, albeit initially reluctantly.  My original dislike for the show was for many of the same reasons I dislike this book: full of stereotypes and insulting to the intelligence of both sexes.  I came to like the show quite a bit once I quit expecting it to reflect dating in real life, and treated it as a fun poke at dating issues in general.  This book is no different, and while entertaining (albeit far less so than the show), it is no more truthful about real life than the show is.    So if you take the point of view offered here and apply it to every man you meet, you'll be making a mistake, as well.  Do what the authors won't tell you to do: take it with a grain of salt and use some common sense.  Take another perspective from a guy...we're not all like this.
B00005ASHM|5.0|This album was the answer to The Beatles' album \\"Rubber Soul\\". Also, this album inspired The Beatles to produce \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Everyone knows that The Beach Boys were called \\"The American Beatles\\" and they led \\"The American Invasion\\". They were almost as big as The Beatles in the 60's. They first hit The U.K. with \\"I Get Around\\" and got to No. 1. After that, the hits went on and on. \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\", \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\", \\"Little Deuce Coupe\\", etc. Between 1961 and 1965, their songs were about surfin' and cars. But around 1965 and 1966, their leader Brian Wilson heard The Beatles'album \\"Rubber Soul\\", Brian was totally impressed. So he tried to produce an album that imitated \\"Rubber Soul\\". Brian spent days and nights to produce this album, trying to do the best that he could. Unsurprisingly, the result was a huge success and it's regarded as \\"The Greatest Album\\" that was ever produced in pop history. Besides that, people claimed that the songs \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\" were \\"The Most Romantic Songs\\" ever produced in pop history. Recently, \\"The Rolling Stone\\" magazine voted it \\"The Greatest Album Of All Time\\". If you are a diehard Beach Boys fan, how can you miss it. Even a casual fan will love it too.

0679777547|3.0|The book trade and the Devil, arguably never very far apart in the first place, meet in this literary mystery novel. <br /> <br />I read this after watching the movie The Ninth Gate which is based on it, and I actually liked the movie better, because it had more artistic unity -- also because, since I don't personally care for the works of Dumas very much, the fact that the movie left that whole plot thread out was fine with me. I suspect not all viewers/readers would feel the same. <br /> <br />I thought CD was an intelligent and interesting book, a bit awkwardly phrased at times as I find literature in translation tends to be, though there were also some nice images. I would have liked it to be a bit more emotionally involving. It would appeal, I think, to people who like Dunning's book-trade mysteries, and who read Dumas, and there's also a sideways connection to Mary Gentle's excellent novel 1610: A Sundial In A Grave. I liked CD enough to seek out the author's other work.
B0006GAOBI|1.0|I really wants to see this movie, but when I see it what a silly, don't make any sense and with that stupid bunny crap they put in that movie makes it really B.S...only thing I like about this movie is soundtrack. Because I grew up in 80s and loved the 80s music in this movie. For just the songs I gives it ONE STAR. But movie is stinks and stupid .don't waste ur money .
0156027321|5.0|Very well crafted book. The story telling and the implications at the end definately gave me pause, and had me considering my own nature. <br /> <br />I read quite a bit these days, usually keeping 3 or 4 books going at a time. This one caught my attention and held it exclusively until finished.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend it, and whatever you do, do not just skip to the end, I think the impact of the ending would have been lost on me had I done so. It really hit a sweet spot with me. This is a book that I felt more so than I was intellectually stimulated by.
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|Cube is the very best.  This one explains what went on with the people that built the thing and it was quite creepy really.  In essence they have a couple of moniters watch what goes in the cube with the unlucky victims and the people recording it start to realize that they are condoning it and feel guilty about it and try to help.  I recommend this film to anyone who loved the first one, it isn't as good, but it is good.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I have a question for those of you who gave this album a one star review, and think anyone who praises this album is a trendy-indie-retro-hipster who works at Starbucks, loves movies like Donnie Darko and Garden State, and takes everything NME and Pitchfork says as gospel:<br /><br />Have you even LISTENED to it? Have you ever considered that The Arcade Fire is NOT the same case as The Strokes (I.E. an overhyped band that was mainly just a rehash of their oh-so obvious influences)? If not, please keep your ignorant opinions to yourself, and give the one star reviews to the bands and artists that deserve them. Like Nelly and Simple Plan, for instance.<br /><br />If it isn't a perfect album, Funeral definitely comes close. It easily takes my \\"Best Of 2004\\" vote and possibly \\"Best Of Millennium\\" vote. It's a concept album about the triumphs and struggles of life, yet every song is vastly different from the last. There are vast, goosebump inducing anthems (\\"Neighborhood #1\\", \\"Wake Up\\") catchy pop songs (\\"Neighborhood #2, \\"Haiti\\") and ass-kicking straight-ahead rock (\\"Neighborhood #3\\", \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\"). Throughout it all, there's an astonishing variety of instrumentation. Sure there's your basic guitar/bass/drums line-up, but it's tempered with pianos, keyboards, xylophones, violins...hell, even an accordion! Seriously, looking at the liner notes and seeing just how many people played on this album is just astonishing. Oh, and the lyrics are extremely witty and filled with truisms such as \\"With my lightning bolts-a-glowing, I can see where I am going to be when the reaper reaches and touches my hand\\" and \\"Our older brother, bit by a vampire, for a year we caught his tears in a cup. And now we're gonna make him drink it. Come on Alex, don't die or dry up!\\"<br /><br />Yes, you can hear influences from The Pixies, Radiohead, and Belle & Sebastian in their sound, but The Arcade Fire manages to become more than just the sum of its influences, and create their own unique sound, which a certain other hyped band I mentioned *AHEM* earlier hasn't managed to do. Also in complete contrast to said band, The Arcade Fire plays with an INSANE amount of energy, more so than any band I've ever heard. It almost gets to the point where you expect the CD to suddenly explode from the sheer force of the member's performances!<br /><br />I don't give a damn what type of music you normally listen to. Buy this, and experience what I believe to be the best indie rock CD since \\"Loveless\\" or \\"OK Computer\\".er hyped band I mentioned *AHEM* earlier hasn't managed to do.

B0000025F7|5.0|Before this album,Michael Jackson had minor success as a solo artist. He enjoyed abundant success with his brothers as the Jackson Five and later,the Jacksons. Since the Jacksons were dropped from the Motown label and had signed with Epic,MJ stuck with this label to this day. On the cover,MJ sports a tuxedo,leaning against a brick wall. DON'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGH debuted on the radio in July 1979. MJ wore the tuxedo in the music video also. In addition to that song,hits that appeared on 1995's HISTORY are ROCK WITH YOU and SHE'S OUT OF MY LIFE. The title track should have been on HISTORY also. I also like WORKING DAY AND NIGHT and Paul McCartney's GIRLFRIEND. Later,ex-Beatle McCartney would join forces with MJ for THE GIRL IS MINE and SAY SAY SAY. This album is a Quincy Jones production and the more successful follow-up THRILLER would be also. Back in '79,MJ wasn't yet the King Of Pop and one of the biggest-selling pop/rock artists. The other songs are incredible.
B000002ITW|3.0|Stephen Stills was right in his assessment of this-atrocious.Although,when I first bought this in 1971,I would pick and choose which cuts to listen to.30 seconds of Suite:Judy Blue Eyes??Come on.David Crosby's The Lee Shore, is nicely done. Same with Graham's Right Between The Eyes.Also, Neil's On The Way Home.In 1971,I did think that Stephen's 49 Bye Bye's/America's Children spoke to what those of us thought about The Establishment.Even though it was kind of sloppy,and according to some accounts,he was high on whatever.The electric side is junk,with the exception of Ohio.This would have been rated lower, except for the remastered version, that has excellent cuts that Graham selected.This was recorded at their Chicago concert, as well as Los Angeles.I'm glad I missed that one.I saw them a year earlier at The Greek Theatre in LA,they were focused,together, and wonderful tight harmonies.
6305433909|3.0|In \\"Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit\\", Whoopi Goldberg returns as Sister Mary Clarence.  This time, she and the sisters work in a San Francisco High School to save the school from closing down by truning their music class into a chior.<br /><br />I never found this film to be just as funny as the first \\"Sister Act\\" movie.  But there were a couple of great musical sequences, which ultimately saved this movie.  Whoopi with the classic rock/soul medley in the opening and the kids chior singing \\"Joyful Joyful\\", which I found to be pretty good.  I think the most important element about the second Sister Act movie was that several members of the kids chior went on to star in other movies, including Jennifer Love Hewitt and Alanna Urbach.  But the most notable in the kids chior was future Fugees member and grammy award winner Lauryn Hill.  Kathy Najimy, Mary Wickes, Wendy Makkena, James Coburn, Ryan Toy of the R&B group City High and Maggie Smith also star.
B000002UA0|4.0|4.25/5 stars, actually.    1. Astronomy Domine - 10/10 Great way to kick off their first album.  2. Lucifer Sam - 10/10 Apparently Syd's ode to his cat and a great rocker.  3. Matilda Mother - 9.5/10    4. Flaming - 9.1/10  5. Pow R. Toc H. - 6.5/10 A somewhat aimless instrumental.    6. Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk - 9/10  7. Interstellar Overdrive - 9.5/10 If a few of the emptier minutes were chopped off it would be a 10/10.      8. The Gnome - 10/10 A strange song to say the least, but great.     9. Chapter 24 - 9/10       10. Scarecrow - 5.5/10 Meh.      11. Bike - 5.5/10 O_o A bit too weird for my taste.      Overall - 8.5/10    I know everyone and their mother praises Barrett. Don't get me wrong, Piper is a very good album, as his small contribution to \\"A Saucerful...\\". However...I am glad Syd left. Come on Floyd-heads, with him do you think they could have crafted such greats as \\"Obscured By Clouds\\", \\"Animals\\", or \\"The Wall\\", or such masterpieces as \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\", or \\"Meddle\\"? I personally don't think they could have.
B00005KAQP|5.0|This 1992 is one of the best comedy movies ever!  Ever!  You can never get tired of Whoopi Goldberg as Las Vegas lounge singer, Delories Van Cartier who becomes Sister Mary Clarence.  Deloris witnesses a murder by her married boyfriend (played by Harvey Kietel) and under Reno police orders, she hides out in a covent in san Francisco, California.  While there, she goes by the name, Sister Mary Clarence and learns how to adjust to life as a nun and also uses her Las Vegas lounge singing experience to teach her follow nuns in the chior how to sing together as a group.<br /><br />I loved this movie from beginning to end and is my No. #1 comedy movie of all-time!  The center square from the Tom Bergeron-hosted game show, Hollywood Squares (1998-2002) was absolutely hilarious here and so was the whole movie!  You will love \\"SISTER ACT\\"!  Kathy Najimy, Maggie Smith and Mary Wickes also star.
0393312836|5.0|Great books seldom make for great films, but when they do, it's usually the movie people remember better. Films reach more people, requiring less investment of their time. Plus, when they are made as well and as excitingly as was Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of this Anthony Burgess novel, it's hard not to think of the movie first.<br /><br />Both feature a young man named Alex who, in what was a vaguely futuristic society for the time, rides around with his friends committing various felonies. Alex lords it over his friends as well, a bit too much. Then he finds himself with one victim too many, and in the hands of the police. His only chance for freedom: Submit to a controversial mind-altering technique that will make him incapable of violence.<br /><br />There are two reasons the book remains vital above the movie. The first, more surface reason, has to do with Nadsat, the unique argot Burgess developed for the youthful protagonist, Alex, and his friends. For example, while contemplating robbing helpless victims, Alex narrates thusly: \\"Our pockets were full of deng, so there was no need...of crasting any more pretty polly to tolchock some old veck in an alley and viddy him swim in his own blood...\\"<br /><br />You can find a Nadsat glossary online if your edition doesn't have one, but the remarkable thing is how well you pick up on the words' meaning after a few pages without looking up definitions. The movie keeps some of the Nadsat but it doesn't have the same place it has in the book, which is too bad since the language makes a point about the corruption of the culture Alex inhabits.<br /><br />The second thing about the book that places it over the movie is explaining what the title is all about. The phrase \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" recurs through the novel, while never appearing in the movie. \\"A fair gloopy title,\\" Alex calls it, when he first spies it on a manuscript of an author he is in the process of terrorizing.<br /><br />As Alex goes on to read, the author describes \\"a clockwork orange\\" as the artificial imposition on man of \\"laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation.\\" This has a ring of irony when Alex himself submits to the technique. It's not that the movie doesn't carry the concept of the clockwork orange, just that it doesn't connect the dots or make the point as effectively.<br /><br />A third reason to choose the book over the movie is the missing 21st chapter, which is found in later editions of the book but not all, and did not appear in the movie. It's kind of a mixed blessing, since the missing chapter wouldn't have gone so well in the movie (hard to imagine the wonderfully malevolent Malcolm McDowell suddenly having a sensitive moment) but does give the reader something positive to take away from an what otherwise might feel depressing upon reflection, the idea that man has two choices, to be controlled artificially or left to their evil desires.<br /><br />But \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is not depressing to read through. It's actually thrilling, mind-warping, and more than a bit funny. You will find yourself liking Alex despite yourself, and adapting to his worldview with surprising ease. That's because Burgess does such a good job of representing the devil inside all of us, why we listen to it, and even, most daringly, why it's better to have one than not.ificial imposition on man of \\"laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation.\\" This has a ring of irony when Alex himself submits to the technique.

B0002F7I9Y|2.0|Don't believe everything you hear.  For example, Ray Charles has been dubbed \\"legendary\\" again and again, but Mr. Charles--unlike Paul Bunyan, Casey Jones, and Robin Hood--really did exist.  Nor was his music legendary, as evidenced by the existence of countless studio takes--including these, which aren't countless but which do seem to go on forever.  Let's face it--the Grammy awards were made for such expertly-produced and soulless equivalents of R&B, jazz, black gospel, and whatever else is supposed to be on aural display here.  Charles' made-to-order versatility has always bored the heck out of me from the first note, and the duet concept makes everything, if anything, even more faux eclectic.  At least Ray's voice, even at this stage, was unobtrusive and as raspily mellifluous as the gentle rattle of a motel air conditioner.  By contrast, Elton John's pipes have become even less musical with time (and lyrics like \\"It seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word\\" even more idiotic), while James Taylor's drone has acquired even more of a complaining, sine wave quality.  Norah Jones had the right idea--she slept through her pairing.  I wish this CD were legendary.  That way, I could hear about it without having to hear it.
B000000OQF|3.0|The only song I really like on this cd is \\"Sweet child of mine,\\" which is pretty much a perfect song.  Everything else rocks hard (...), though I don't really think that is a good thing.  All of the songs celebrate really stupid things, which kill a lot of people and ruin a lot of lives.  A glimpse of the Hollywood dream it may be, but when you buy this cd you are paying for Axl's and Slash's extreme bingeing and drug habits.  That also goes for The Vines, Elvis Costello, and Marilyn Manson, as well as thousands of other idiot drug users.  Don't waste your money just to see the \\"Hollywood Dream\\" or whatever people talk about this album as being.
630587493X|5.0|A common theme: to seek that which you are deprived.<br /><br />Williams plays Andrew, a robot with an anomaly who seeks recognition he is more.  As the film progresses in a Forrest Gump meets A.I. fashion, Andrew meets his issues with a \\"That won't do...\\" attitude changing the world and people around him.<br /><br />To me, it addresses the issue of acceptance and recognition for being different more than the humanity issue.  He portrays human characteristics like creativity, making mistakes and love, but his positronic immortality would create jealousy amongst the flesh. The decisions Andrew makes opens my eyes to what I take for granted, and how ridiculous humanity can be at times.<br /><br />Do I even want to be part of humanity?  This movie makes me cry every time (a rarity).
B000001FS3|5.0|I won't go into too much detail over this album.  I like it because it was made the year I was born, and I didn't discover it until just recently.  It is the only real essential purchase if you want to get into U2.  All of the songs are good, unlike later albums of their which have a lot of filler.  Go check it out, most likely you will like it a lot.  Most people do.
B00000294R|5.0|this album is insane <br /> <br />In an era of mediocre rappers and \\"studio gangsters\\" big L is a godsend. Big L kills the mic for reals and the beats on this are ridiculous. Big L speaks what he knows which is precisely the X factor that gives this album so much more substance than your average \\"g-unit\\" album [what a rancid comparison--forgive me]. This album is so perfected i wouldn't be suprised if he came up with a 100+ tracks and picked the best 12. Either that or he has maaad skills. word.  <br />Fav. Song: prolly danger zone...hard to pick <br /> <br />warning: this album is NOT for the light-hearted.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|I guess there is a bit of fuss over the remastering on this cd.  All I have to say is that it sounds awesome, all of the songs are funny in a weird way.  I mean, just listening to \\"white rabbit\\" cracked me up.  Hippies are so fun, and funny!  This is a classic from the 60's, and you can't miss by getting it.  It might sound a little dated, but hey, it is still a classic, a document of its time.  The remastering doesn't really concern me at all because the songs are quite wonderful, but I wonder what Jerry Garcia (from the Grateful Dead, as any fule kno!) actually did on this cd.  He is listed as \\"spiritual advisor\\" and said to be the man who came up with the name for this cd.  For quite a long time it has been a mystery as to whether Garcia had even shown up to their recording sessions (band says yes, management and record company says no)  I like to believe he did come occasionally, probably just to sit around and smoke a fat joint (har har).  JA captured the magic of the 60's, but they also captured the silly idiocy of it.  For all of that, look no further than this great cd.
0783229526|5.0|\\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\", takes place in the dying days of the flower children in the late seventies. But this has no relevance because almost everything in the film gives no insight to what eactly is going on. This is the beauty of the movie mainly because it almost makes the viewer see this drug binge involing Johnny Depp, and Benicio DEl Toro from their own dillusional experience, with ether ,Acid,coke, and a small army of uppers and downers. The film shows the highs and lows from this ample sized portion of drugs ingested by the two main characters. The plot twists constantly when the high stakes became a problem with the law and several hotels. The intent put by Hunter Thompson was to find the american dream but the thought of this isnt very apparent in the movie. Regardless its a great flick and well worth watching
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This isn't a movie to over-intellectualize or read into. This is a movie to enjoy.  <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is about a high school student who is the geek of all geeks. Breaking with Hollywood tradition, this Napoleon isn't appealing because he's misunderstood, or because his heart of gold is continually tramped on by school bullies. The whole appeal of Napoleon is that he's completely and utterly pathetic. <br /> <br />His interests range from nun-chucks to the Loch Ness Monster to drawing bad pictures. He is intimidated by the school bullies, but cruel to those who won't retaliate against him. He is completely self-centered, and his self-serving ulterior motives are completely transparent.  <br /> <br />Napoleon lives in his rural Idaho home with his dramatically older, and seemingly mentally handicapped, brother Kip, who spends all day chatting on the internet to women. Usually, they are cared for by their grandmother, but she has been called away unexpectedly, and so they are supervised by their uncle, who is constantly reliving his non-glory days on the high school football team and trying to sell tupperware or other things to the local housewives.  <br /> <br />There's not much of a plot to this movie; it's mostly just a string of intensely hilarious scenes which feature Napoleon or the quirky members of his growing world. Toward the end, a plot evolves out of a race for school president between Summer, the popular girl, and Napoleon's only friend (and seemingly the only Mexican student).  <br /> <br />The 11th hour vindication seems like a cheat, but at least Napoleon isn't carried away on the shoulders on a wave of newfound popularity. Instead, he finds someone to play tetherball with, and this quiet triumph is a good place to end it.  <br /> <br />This movie will stick in your mind, and Napoleon will stay with you in the same way that the Billy Bob Thornton character in Sling Blade does. He is so bizarre, and yet so like someone you went to high school with, that he is impossible to forget.  <br /> <br />Most of all, the inventive and hilarious character-driven jokes will crack you up. If you're going to rent one movie this year, make it this one. We all need a good laugh.  <br /> <br />The DVD itself is kind of sparsely featured, although it does have a few extra glimpses of Napoleon, which is all you can ask for. <br />
0765309408|4.0|I agree with the reviews that call this reads like a cross between Haldeman and Heinlein.  This is a good and bad thing. <br /> <br />I mean, like everyone else, I read it, enjoyed it and drew the parallel. <br /> <br />However, when considered in comparison with \\"Broken Angels,\\" or \\"Singularity Sky,\\" well, let's face it, it reads like sci-fi from 30 years ago: not bad, enjoyable, instantly familiar.  But a little stale.
B0006J28KU|5.0|i cannot come up with the words that it takes to explain this movie.  so diverse, so deep, so intriguing.  i'll keep it short because: why try to explain something that cannot be explained?  for those of you who have seen itand appreciate it as much as i do, you'll know what i am talking about.  you can't lay a finger on why exactly it's so good, it just is.  the whole feel of the movie....ah too much.  for those of you who haven't seen it, watch it as soon as you get a chance.  this is one of the most underrated, unrecognized movies out there.  it truly is a masterpiece.

B0000DKKY4|5.0|Born Steven Georgiou, he adopted the name Cat Stevens for his musical career but subsequently became a Muslim, quitting his musical career and changing his name again, this time to Yusuf Islam. This compilation of his music as Cat Stevens is as good as any you are likely to find.<br /><br />Cat had a minor UK hit in 1966 (I love my dog) but established himself as a songwriter by providing the Tremeloes with their first hit since Brian Poole left them (Here comes my baby) and by providing P P Arnold with her first hit (First cut is the deepest). Those hits were both in 1967, the year in which Cat had his first major hit as a singer, when Matthew and son peaked at number two in the UK. It was the biggest hit he ever had. He had another top ten UK hit (I'm gonna get me a gun) and two minor hits (A bad night, Kitty) in 1967 but none of those hits are included here. Actually, despite their hit status, they aren't really important.<br /><br />Cat left his original label (Deram) and signed to Island, after which he recorded a series of albums that won him international acclaim. Although he placed six singles on the UK charts, all included here, his reputation ultimately rests with his albums. This explains why so many of his fans do not like compilations of his music, preferring the original albums.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there is a market for compilations and there are plenty of people who don't want (or can't afford) to collect Cat's original albums. So here you get those hits (Lady D'Arbanville, Moon shadow, Morning has broken, Can't keep it in, Another Saturday night, Remember the days of the old school yard) as well as other classic tracks such as Peace train, Father and son, Wild world and Cat's own versions of Here comes my baby and First cut is the deepest.<br /><br />If you want just one Cat Stevens collection, make it this one - but if you decide to collect his original albums instead, start with Tea for the tillerman or Teaser and the firecat.
0385335482|3.0|I laughed so much in Can You Keep a Secret, but then again, I did read that before I picked up Confessions of a Shopaholic.  Set in England, Confessions of a Shopaholic reveals the story of Rebecca (Becky) Bloomwood.  She works for Successful Saving as a financial journalist and has this habit of buying everything she desires (she knows her fashion) and maxing out her credit cards.  When the bills start to pile up and the phone calls start coming, she does all she can to run away from her financial problems, from calling in sick with a rare fever to skipping out on meetings with the bank.  The book starts off really cute, with Becky screaming OH MY GOSH I LOVE THAT _______ every other page, but after awhile, her delightful squeals at great sales were a little dull and repetitive as I was muttering, \\"Just pay your debts already!\\" about halfway into the book.  I am glad, however, that she finally learns to wake up and deal with her debt problems by the end of the book (and acquires some fame and a handsome boyfriend to boot), but the book just isn't as good or as fast paced (in an \\"I-want-to-know-what-happens-next\\" way) as I thought it would be.
B0000DD79B|5.0|Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel were better together than apart, because they had such different talents. Paul was a brilliant songwriter - certainly one of the best of his generation - and a good singer without being anything special. Art was not a songwriter, but he had a superb voice that brought out the best in Paul's songs.<br /><br />So, here we have 40 of their finest recordings, digitally re-mastered to sound better than ever, with most of the songs written by Paul and Art doing most of the singing.<br /><br />Of course, all the obvious tracks are included - Bridge over troubled water, Mrs Robinson, Homeward bound, Sound of silence, The boxer, Cecilia, Feeling groovy, I am a rock, America and El condor pasa (If I could) - but this collection contains a further 30 tracks which are all of a very high quality.<br /><br />Among them you'll find Hazy shade of winter (a song revived brilliantly by the Bangles in the eighties), the upbeat but rueful Keep the customer satisfied, Baby driver - another upbeat song, a cover version of Bye bye love, not forgetting the superb Scarborough fair/Canticle.<br /><br />After the split, Paul and Art each had some success as solo singers, but despite some great individual moments, they never achieved the level of consistency separately that they achieved together - and this is one of the best collections you'll ever find.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Where do you put it?  All of you who are big Jack Johnson fans have probably been asked the same thing.  \\"So what kind of music does he play?\\"  You respond \\"Uh, I guess, uh..., I guess it's kind of like surf/folk, acoustic rock, blues, reggae, ska, jazz, and cabana music all intertwined in a laid back atmosphere\\" (or something along those lines). The fact is, you can't put it anywhere.  Jack Johnson had created his own style.  His absorption of multiple genres in collaboration with two other musical geniuses Adam Topol(drums) and Merlo(bass) have fused together what I like to call \\"reflection\\".  It's the type of music you can listen to and reflect on yourself through innovative musical theory and imaginative lyrical poeticism. No the music is not complex.  But it's original.  And because its not complex, anyone can appreciate it.  Two of my favorite songs on the album are \\"Times Like These\\" and \\"Holes to Heaven\\".  \\"Times Like These\\" is a song Jack wrote to mock the nature of humans today and how we take things for granted, become self-absorbed, and to become over-prided.  He uses basic chord progressions but allures the listener with his talent in deep verse.  \\"Holes to Heaven\\" gives a somewhat unique twist on perception with the lyrics \\"there were so many fewer questions, when stars were still just the holes to heaven.\\"  Playing on chordal blues scales coupled with pop/folk vocals, Jack Johnson illustrates how he can blend genres.  As far his trademark goes, I guess it would have to be his voice, or maybe his guitar style.  It's really hard to decide. That's what makes him intriguing.  But whatever his trademark is, everyone knows when a Jack Johnson song when they hear one, even if they've heard him only once before.  Compared to his first album, \\"Brushfire Fairytales\\", you can tell Jack has matured quite a bit, and we will probably be blown away by his new album \\"In-Between Dreams\\", scheduled to release March 1.  <br /> <br />You can attempt to compare Jack to other artists, Donovan Frankenreiter, Mason Jennings, G-Love, and Sublime, but really he has a sound all of his own.  This album is the album for everyone.  There is no one who won't appreciate it. <br />
B000007VLL|5.0|This compilation focuses on Bonnie's eighties music recorded for CBS, but her four UK hits for RCA (Lost in France, More than a love, It's a heartache, Married men) are also included under license. So this collection contains all of Bonnie's UK hits, plus a selection of her other tracks from the eighties.<br /><br />Apart from the RCA hits already mentioned (two of which made the UK top ten), Bonnie's other UK hits to be found here are Total eclipse of the heart (a number one hit), A rocking good way (a top five hit duet with Shaking Stevens), Holding out for a hero (a number two hit) and three minor hits, these being Have you ever seen the rain (a cover of the Creedence Clearwater Revival classic), Faster than the speed of night and Loving you is a dirty job.<br /><br />Also here is Bonnie's original recording of The best. Generally known as Simply the best, it completely missed the charts, but Tina Turner covered the song a year later and had a major international hit with it. Another song that you may be familiar with is To love somebody. Originally written and recorded by the Bee Gees, the song has been a hit for several different singers around the world. Nina Simone (in 1969) and Jimmy Somerville (in 1990) both took it into the UK top ten.<br /><br />There are many Bonnie Tyler compilations to choose from. I wouldn't describe this as the strongest but it contains all the essential tracks that most people expect and it is reasonably priced.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|smashing cd that is smashing up the charts around the world. <br />first heard michel buble at the lighting of the tree in newyork just caught him on lettermen the other nite. <br />friends in london england say he is exploding all over europe  there to so the world is embracing it's time. my opinion is he poseses the best voice in the world rite now bar none and he's gorgeus. your ears eyes wont lie it's time is supergood.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|The first \\"Scary Movie\\" is definitely the best of the three of them, because it's more funny, entertaining and everything else than the others. starting with Carmen Electra farting, this film compilates very good parts of the best horror movies of that times and makes them be funny, without taking away the death of the charachters. The 2nd Scary Movie isn't better than this one, because it takes part in one place only, but it has very sexual and funny parts too, like when the girl gets f***ed by the ghost in her bedroom and she jumps all over the room like she was flying...but we're talking about this one, and I really loved it, it's the best of the three of them.
0486417751|3.0|This book is a classic.  I decided to order it to add to my library.  When I received the book, I realized it was unabridged meaning everything is a literal translation.  I would recommend getting a version that makes sense of the sentences.  Otherwise, a good book to read - one that everyone must read at least once in their lifetime.
B00008MJ8H|5.0|You will not go wrong with this album. Every track is a masterpiece.  If you loved the movie, you must have the accompanying soundtrack. I've had it for 15 years and when the mood strikes, there is nothing like it. Now, this version also comes with a few unreleased tracks. You can't lose!
0060763280|5.0|Fruitloop, you amaze me! You are so off the mark here that it boggles the mind. <br /> <br />How on earth does one become a Top Rated Reviewer on Amazon by reviewing books that he hasn't even read? <br /> <br />I ask this because you obviously haven't read this book. <br /> <br />Harv's message is that positive thinking doesn't work. I repeat: it doesn't work. The entire book is meant to drill into readers the fact that if you want to succeed, you need to get off your butt and take action. You need to start a business and begin making things happen in the real world.  <br /> <br />If you had bothered to actually read the book, you'd recall the page where he talks about meditating and visualizing wealth but never having it drop into his lap. <br /> <br />His entire message is that thinking about wealth won't do it. To make it happen in your life you need to get off your butt, roll up your sleeves, and \\"just do it\\". <br /> <br />After reading the book, I see it as a tool for overcoming the bad habits and beliefs that fuel endless procrastination.  <br /> <br />Seriously, Fruitloop, next time try reading a book before writing a \\"review\\".
B0002OERI0|3.0|I love green day. I have all their cds, even the old stuff like kerplunk, and other cds. I love each green day cd. Not just saying that. I love every cd. Each one sounds different and original. I even like warning, which a lot of people dont seem to like. Warning had a very mature sound. It had a lot of acoustic songs mixed with the green day sound. I heard american idiot on the radio in early september, and i wasnt really impressed. It sounded like something off insomniac. It was a good song, and i liked it the more that i listened to it, but overall it was ok. I was really looking forward to the cd. I bought it the day it came out, and listened to the whole thing all the way through. I was let down. American idiot, jesus of suburbia, holiday, and boulevard are all great, but it goes downhill from there. Are we the waiting sounds like a rip off of POD's youth of the nation. St. Jimmy is pretty good, but sounds so much like american idiot, or something else off insomniac. Novocane sounds like warning, and it sounds a little lazy. Shes a rebel is a song i just plain dont like. It sounds too pop-ish. Like simple plan or something. Extraordinary girl i dont like at all. I usually skip over it. I've tried to listen to it, its just not good. Letterbomb saves the second half of the cd. I love this song. Wake me up when september ends is awful. Billy joe just sings the title of the song over and over again. Its annoying. Homecoming is ok. It would be better if the 2 minute songs in jesus of suburbia, and homecoming were full length. If they were full length, i might just like the cd a whole lot more. Whatshername starts out promising, but ends  completely differently. Overall, i like maybe 6 out of the 13 tracks. The rest are throwaways. I'm going to their concert and hopefully they dont play too many songs on american idiot.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|As a musician myself, I have looked up to Mr. Charles all my life.  This is truly his best work, and I believe showcases his true \\"Genius.\\"  I recommend this album to everyone, especially those who are not already Ray Charles fans.  I guarantee you will become one upon listening to this collection.  Highly recommended.
B000002JSZ|5.0|I think this is a good album. My personal favorites are \\"Flick of the Switch\\", \\"Bedlam in Belgium\\", and \\"Rising Power\\". Bedlam in Belgium is my favorite on the whole album. I still like this entire album, though. Brian Johnson does not screech like he does in The Razor's Edge(1990). This is a must-buy for AC/DC fans.
B0006SSOHM|2.0|I was told by one of my friends that this film was ''the best movie ever''. Now , because my friend is one of the most intelligent people i know , i thought to myself ''wow , this must be really good...'' , so i went out and watched it. Well , at first it started off promisingly enough  , a gritty , disturbing scene with 2 men in a hellish situation. From there it goes quite well , suspense and mystery build up reasonably , and the viewer sits there in awe wondering about how the men will get out of the situation they are in , and who is the person responsible. However , things begin to get lame as the finale gets closer , and then finally , there's the famous ''Twist''. This ''twist''is actually the dumbest twist i have seen im a movie for as long as i can remember. Forget comapring it to the twist in ''The 6th sense'' , its not even in the same league. I read another review that compares ''Saw'' to the masterful and classy ''Audition'' , sorry to say , but that comparison is ridiculous. All i say is this , when the ''twist'' happens , just think to yourself , ''How?''. Once that question is asked , the film falls apart. And im not talking about the doctor either , im talking about all the other victims. How on earth did the killer find them? How did he get their details ? Was it that the killer just picked people at random and then they just happened to be people that wasted their lives? For the killer to pick them , he would have had to research them . How did he research them?? Seriously , c'mon , dont even try to say that its a horror film and that plot holes dont matter , because they do. This film is nowhere near as good as people make it out to be. Its amateurish at best , and the twist is pathetic. <br />Its really a waste of time.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|This film is an interesting mix of pre-World War II characters, reminding the viewer of entertaining cartoon-like creations. It has futuristic high tech science blended with the menace and threat of an evil scientist who is bent on destroying the world as we know it. The primary settings are: a huge city, very much like New York ... a distant unnamed island where on-going research is done by the \\"good guys\\" who have captured the giant \\"robots\\" which arrive unexpectedly and threaten the population. Later the Sky Captain and Polly Perkins the reporter explore the Himalayas specifically Shambala or Shangri-La ... because of a secret map which Polly obtained ... and due to hints left by Dexter, one of the 'good guy' researchers. They are at some point rescued by \\"Frankie\\" who it turns out is an ace pilot. Angelie Jolie very adeptly plays Frankie who is really \\"Franceska\\" ...<br /><br />Polly Perkins (Gweneth Paltrow) is a highly engaging news reporter who takes great risks to get the \\"scoop\\" of a lifetime. She couragously tracks the giant robots to write the first newspaper story about this major threat facing the population of the city. She receives a phone call to meet a scientist at the theater. He hints of secret experiments which occurred somewhere in Germany done by a scientist which are similar to the high tech threats facing the city. The good scientist disappears ... she fears he is murdered for \\"knowing too much\\" and passing it on to her. Before he died, he entrusted her with some valuable documents ... their value becomes known only later after Polly combines her efforts with the Sky Captain. The Sky Captain (played by Jude Law) zooms into view while the giant robots roam the city destroying whatever is in their path ... He flys adroitly between them, among them, adn between sky scrapers and buildings ... risking his life to discover what signals make them work. Eventually, he and Polly exchange information and reluctantly become allies in searching for the truth which lies behind the baffling robotic life-threatening menace. They have a history together ... were considered a romantic item ... but do not entirely trust each other due to some perceived let downs by each. One or the other generally holds back vital information even as they pair up to seek the truth ... It is clear from their exchanges that the film will be enjoyable and sparkling. The energy dynamics of the personalities of the characters are magnetic ... The film promises to be entertaining by the eclectic mix of unique settings, creative use of sci-fi, and the unique and complex plot that unfolds. At times there is a Matrix-like feel to the film ... the Tibetan scenes are well done. This viewer was entertained from beginning to end by the odd twists and turns of the plot which led to a climax and explosive conclusion.

B000002KDO|5.0|Listening to this album conjurs up images of some mid-seventies trashed biker hang-out in southern California.  I can just smell the stench of ashtrays full of butts and roaches, with some burnout passed out on a couch riddled with cigarette burns and stains from mishandled longnecks. <br />Is it a good album?  It is the very definition of early Sabbath, and under no terms is it to be questioned.
0399230033|5.0|I purchased this book for my 2-year-old son. I had studied the reviews carefully before purchasing, and was convinced this would be a nice addition to his library. When we got the book, I first read it by myself for evaluation & to practice my reading. And...I couldn't help but laugh out laud because it was SO FUNNY! You will love the concept & humor of the story. And how CUTE the illustration of all of the zoo animals!! I was very impressed and couldn't wait to read it to my boy at his bed time. His reaction - he got glued to it! Every time he saw a new animal coming out of the cage he gasped and then screamed! I don't know how much of the humor he can understand but he certainly adores every single page of the book. The only phrase used in this book is a simple \\"Good night, xxxx (animal name)\\", and the rest depends upon your story telling & how you want to enjoy the book. But I assure you and your child will love all of the characters in this book!
B0006399FS|1.0|These sellouts are saturating the market with just their egos once again. U2 now now brings to mind an image of someone stuck on a treadmill who has been fooled into believing that he's actually moving forward.     U2's decline appeared on All That You Can't Leave Behind. An absurd attempt at radio hit, destined to sell the U2 legacy to a bunch of MTV brianwashed kids. Moreover, they used perfectly well the September 11th situation to sell even more copies of that fluff.     For this album, U2 used every hot media - Rolling Stone, NME, Billboard, Mojo, Grammy, Apple, MTV, etc - in the game to guarantee their last album a wide enough audience to justify the effort. They dilettantish attitude comes off as manipulative.     They simply forgot how moronic and embarrassingly tuneless this album is. They knew \\"U2\\" name alone still can sale several million copies worldwide. Despite 'Best Of' 1990-2000 is one of the worst compilations ever made even for the fans, yet it sold a few millions just because it was a \\"U2\\" compilation, do you know what I mean?. What a trivial piece of friggin garbage by bunch of washed up, self-indulgent, trite old men who are ripping off the awful All That You Can't Leave Behind.    This sellout U2 fails on every level. Nodoby believed Larry's apologizes, nobody believed Edge's story about 'new album stolen'. Nobody believe in Bono anymore when he asks money for Africa and the third world while he has become in a plastic manufactured sellout iPod singer.    U2 are now a document of arrogance, sellout and ineptitude. By the way, Bono's hair grows back. U2 just should retire today
B000002I25|5.0|Jim Morrison/GOD has the most amazing voice ever, and this album proves it.
B00006LIRI|1.0|That 'Rest Of The Best' idea sounds more interesting than this poorly represented 'Best Of'. Many obvious standouts are missing, as 'Please', 'Lemon', 'The Fly', etc. To add insult to injury we also have an unforgivable doubling up of 'Discotheque', 'Staring At The Sun', 'Gone' and 'Numb'. Plus 2  blatant inclusions to attract the many U2 completists: 'Electrical Storm' and 'The Hands That Built America'. <br /> <br />Buy their 90's statements instead: Achtung Baby, Zooropa and POP. <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|Everything you know is wrong. Or so U2 claimed on the multi-media overload intro sequence of the Zoo TV tour back in 1992. <br /> <br />To put it more accurately and adapt that post-modern adage for U2's ninth album, everything you've read is wrong. Because, despite the almost universal hyperbole that has greeted HTDAAB - courtesy of Rolling Stone, New Musical Express, Billboard, etc -this far from being even a decent album. Certainly their worst album, by U2's stratospheric 80s and 90s standards. <br /> <br />HTDAAB: rolls past like a spanking red carpet, limped on by leaden-footed royalty. An early affair, a hazy infatuation, that has since bloated into comfortable taking-for-granted. As with all ubiquitous products, the familiarity of logos, slogans, and icons eventually supplants whatever original feelings we may have had. <br /> <br />This U2 sellouts are, indeed, a universal product, much like the Catholic Church Bono humbly admires. The swoosh on The Edge's skully cap, and the golden arches of Bono's glasses spring to mind. The emtpyness of 'Vertigo' opens with bombast after Larry's sticks counting, and peaks with Bono's annoying cracking voice in the shouted coda. With 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' Bono seems dead set on ruining U2's return with clichs. <br /> <br />The vulnerability of Bono's rough voice become even more evident on 'A Man And A Woman', 'Original Of The Species', 'All Because Of You' and 'Yahweh'. I really don't know how the hell he likes the sound of his own voice. Maybe he feel numb, comfortably numb.  <br /> <br />This mainstream album is so predictable, safe, radio-friendly, and uninspiring and uninspired. Still, this dull record is disliked even for the traditionalist fans that U2 lost by making daring and admirably masterpieces like 'Pop' and 'Zooropa'. <br /> <br />PS: R.Johnson. Stop putting your childish reviews twice, that's pathetic. Thank You <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie was very enjoyable to me, as \\"pointless\\" and \\"plotless\\" as it may be. <br />Now to you one-star reviewers: <br />Yes this movie was different. Somebody is original and you reward them with saying their movie sucks? There are very few, if any, movies out there like Napoleon Dynamite. That's GOOD, I don't want to watch 10 of the same movie under a different title... which seems much like some of the movies out there today. <br />I understand that it may not be for everyone but this is a very good movie, Jon Heder does a VERY good job portraying a nerd, according to my classmates I'm \\"just like Napoleon\\", which isn't a compliment but it amuses me. <br /> <br />There's so many dumb movies out there about preps, like Mean Girls, don't the geeks/nerds deserve a movie too?
B00062ZE3U|5.0|I have never understood why some people were so obsessed with the idea of bands \\"selling out\\".  I simply look at an album and ask whether it contains beauty.  I need not even ask the question here- the beauty leaps out at me on each of these tracks to a degree that I have to laugh in pure joy.  This is a fantastic album.  I love all of their previous stuff, but I think this is their best.  I also see a lot of people who clearly hate Evanescence and argue that because Within Temptation is emulating them to some extent, WT has gone to crap.  Just because something becomes popular or even shows small signs of emulation, this doesn't mean it isn't a quality product.  I used to shun all popular music in an attitude of clear arrogance that I had superior musical taste over the \\"mindless masses\\".  Now I realize that both popular and hidden artists can be great- forget about the media and advertising, don't look at album inserts, just listen to the music- it is undeniably beautiful here.  The vocals, the instrumentation, and well-utilized guitars and strings especially- this is a masterwork!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah's music is, first and foremost, intimate. Put it on late at night, and it sounds like Norah is right There in your room singing and piano-playing for you. Her music is sensual, soothing, tender. It is tranquil; it has an incredible stillness that comes from deep within her; meditative. <br /> <br />It has a strong sleepy quality though - so it's not something you'll play to give you that get up and go in the morning. But there's no better music to caress you and usher you to sweetest dreams than this. Or for quiet afternoons and rainy days.
B00000251N|4.0|I haven't heard much from Neil Diamond (even though I feel I should know more than the few hits I hear on the radio now and then) but this album is pretty different compared to those radio songs. <br /> <br />This album has decent vocal melodies decorated over a big orchestral sound.  I love this kind of music but I think the orchestra appears a bit too much on this album and sometimes this can result in certain moments of the album to become somewhat aimless.  Maybe I just have to listen to it more (I only played the album three times so far).  I don't think this is a major problem.   <br /> <br />Probably my biggest problem is that one or two of Neil's vocal melodies appear too often throughout the record.  I was hoping to hear some vocal changes on side two, and even though side two does have a few new things (like that children's choir which is very good) overall it's hard for me to take in the entire album because certain themes appear too often.  Combine this with the somewhat aimless orchestral parts and my grade for this album goes down a little. <br /> <br />But the best thing about this album is the relaxing and romantic mood.  Certain parts of this album make me think of the Who's Quadrophenia.  Probably because the Who album repeats a few themes throughout the album, just like this Neil Diamond record.   <br /> <br />You may want to look into this Neil Diamond album anyway.  It's good music, I just wish there were more vocal melodies.  Then again, it's a soundtrack, and I guess soundtracks focus more on the music then on the singing.  I don't know, I never listen to soundtracks (except this one!)
B00008977N|5.0|This dvd has excellent sound quality.  The video quality is a 3 star rating.  I highly recommended this for your dvd concert collection just for the sound quaulity.  Crank up first song \\"talk to me\\" and \\"don't give up\\"
B000002505|5.0|My college roomate played  this for me in 1974 and I was instantly converted.  The music and total package of the original album would just send me to some unknown quarter. Yes, <br />I worship at the altar of Love, Devotion, & Surrender. Roll your eyes and call me a cult member or whatever, I don't care. All I know and feel is that this is great music by great musicians. <br />And I'm no Sri Chinmoy devotee either.  You have to marvel how such beautiful sounds can appear in a world filled with violence and hate. Definitely not for the casual listener.
B000002IAS|5.0|I've listened to this album off & on for over 30 years and it really is the relatively unknown and unrecognized gem that other reviewers say it is.  When it was transferred from vinyl to cd I thought there was a terrible drop-off of Clapton's fantastic guitar work.  Actually tossed the cd out & stuck with a tape I'd made from the original lp.  Anyway, I was about to get the tape transferred to CD by one of the better transfer companies (hint, in Pittsburgh) but wanted to make sure the tape was really superior to the cd.  So I bought another cd from amazon, listened exhaustively to both it and my old tape and decided the cd was just fine.  Not sure what happened, but I'd take a prior reviewer's criticism of the quality of the cd with a grain of salt and go ahead and buy it.  Then listen...you'll be just as happy as the other reviewers who rave about this album.
B000002U82|5.0|Pure psychedelic goodness and THE best album of the 1970's.  This is Pink Floyd's masterpiece I mean if anybody gives this below 5 stars then they have no respect for music.  To me, this album is like 1 big song so I can't really rate any song in particular.  I mean all of the songs are masterpieces but if I really have to be biased and this may be pushing it, highlights include Time, Money, Us And Them, and the Great Gig In The Sky.  But in order to really enjoy this album don't just download 1 or 2 songs.  Buy it for crying out load. Just compare this to the music today.  It blows it away no doubt.  So take my word for it, stop reading this review, and buy it.
B00062IVKS|5.0|Revised for Blu-ray release:The two disc 30th Anniversary release combo on Blu-ray looks extremely good but is flawed--there's a noticeable translucent strip in the corner of the image that is slightly brighter than the rest of the image. It's a bit distracting at first but once you get into the film, you'll find it less noticeable. This flaw was also visible in the DVD edition of the film. The transfer is very good but not flawless.<br /><br />There are some new special features for this edition including: \\"Marty & Bobby\\" featuring director and actor interviewed about how they ended up working on the film together (DeNiro brought the project to Scorsese). \\"Raging Bull-Reflections of a Classic\\" features four directors Neil LeBute, Richard Kelly and Kimberly Pierce discussing the influence and impact of the film. \\"Remembering Jake\\" allows us to listen in as the Veteran Boxer's Association of New York do their monthly get together and discuss Jake LaMotta. \\"Marty on Film\\" allows Scorsese to discuss his career as a director. All of the new material presented on this disc is in HD.<br /><br />We get the previous special features carried over from the previous DVD edition. The set also includes a DVD with no special features included as well. The packaging is problematic--the Blu-ray packging is about as flimsy as it comes with the \\"green\\" packaging that isn't solid with plastic \\"bands\\" supporting the disc. The only problem is that if something pokes the packaging it'll rip the paper (and in my case it also caused the Blu-ray to be badly scratched. It also means that it's MORE likely to get knocked loose inside the packaging because it doesn't hold the disc as securely. Unfortunately more studios are going to this packaging supposedly because it's \\"green\\" but, really, it has more to do with it being cheap.<br /><br />DVD Review:<br /><br />The Academy has been wrong on many occasions. This would be one of them. As interesting a drama as \\"Ordinary People\\" was Robert Redford's film can't hold a candle to the complex drama that was passed over for both best director and best picture. \\"Raging Bull\\" features Scorsese's cinematic gifts at their peak. The kinetic camera of Michael Chapman and Scorsese's unusual but powerful compositions capture the boxing ring in a way never quite seen before. He also captures the human element in the same way. Jake LaMotta's gift is his ability to punish himself for his sins. He can be pummeled by others and withstand every single massive punch of his opponents. Yes he can knock them out but it's also his ability to outlast them that makes LaMotta so difficult to beat in the ring. The boxing ring changes from a place of sport to a place of war for one man's soul. Robert DeNiro's brilliant portrayal of LaMotta earned him a well deserved Oscar but without Scorsese's sharp as nails direction and the rich imagery of Michael Chapman's cinematography, \\"Raging Bull\\" would just have been another biopic about a famous boxer. The difference between the deluxe two disc edition of \\"Raging Bull\\" and the single disc version comes down to the featurettes and documentary on disc two and the commentary tracks on disc one. Both the single disc and two disc versions feature the same top notch transfer.<br /><br />A beautiful, detailed transfer brings out the rich shadows, dark blacks and bright whites of Michael Chapman's cinematography. Presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first time this anamorphic transfer captures all the detail missing from the previous version released on DVD (which was reportedly cropped from the 1.33:1 TV version. Shot in black and white on high contrast film, the film retains it's grainy texture that added a sense of gritty reality to the original theatrical release. Presented in an enhanced Dolby Digital 5.1 and the original 2.0 Dolby Digital Surround soundtrack, the detailed soundtrack sounds terrific with virtually no compression issues and great presence.<br />---<br />Extras:In Before the Fight the principle cast and crew discuss all the struggles that producers Chartoff and Winkler faced in making the movie. A project that DeNiro had first proposed to Scorsese when he was making Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. It's ironic that Scorsese who was never a big sports fan would make the ultimate boxing movie. Scorsese discusses how he was ultimately persuaded to make the movie by DeNiro (who had the idea of doing the physical transformation for LaMota as he ages from the very beginning). Luckily Chartoff and Winkler had produced Rocky. The duo used the success of their film as leverage to get Raging Bull.<br /><br />\\"In the Ring\\" focuses on the actual production issues they faced. Watching pre-production footage Scorsese came to the conclusion that Irwin Winkler's suggestion to shoot the film in black and white was perfect for capturing the \\"vintage\\" look of the era. Editor Thelma Schoonmaker points out that amazingly Raging Bull was shot with only one camera. Schoonmaker also points out the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) differences between fights and how changing the design of the ring, the lighting and how the sequences reflected Jake's emotional state at the time. While the film was storyboarded, Scorsese primarily used them to help keep track of the way the film would ultimately look when put together.<br /><br />\\"In Outside the Ring\\" Pesci points out that the film was far from improvised. Schrader provided the dramatic structure and the actors would improvise during the rehearsal sessions and would then be, for the most part, written in stone. We learn much more about the dramatic scenes in this section with Cathy Morarity discussing everything from how the hairdresser would use corn syrup to keep her hair perfect. Chapman shot many of the color home movies then realized he couldn't shoot them with bad framing like typical home movies. The teamsters working on the production shot these sequences.<br /><br />\\"After the Fight\\" Pesci and Schoonmaker justify the extreme violence of the film by pointing out that Scorsese wasn't trying to glorify it but make it as ugly as possible particularly when it came to the fight sequences but also during the domestic fights between LaMotta and his family. Sound Effects editor points out some of the simple ideas that he used to highlight the differences between the fights sometimes during various punches such as the sound of a horse shuttering or an elephant braying during two intense fights. Warner would routinely burn the tapes he used for the sound effects at the end of each production forcing himself to create anew all over again with a new concept for each movie.<br /><br />\\"The Bronx Bull\\" features Jake LaMotta discussing seeing the movie for the first time. We then hear from film critics as to the reaction to the film. Schoonmaker talks about how the trade papers warned distributors NOT to book the film. Ironically, the critics asked about the film are British critics who seem to have the best appreciation for the film. The Bronx Bull duplicates many comments in the 20 minute featurettes included but, nonetheless, it provides additional background on the film not available elsewhere.<br /><br />\\"DeNiro vs. LaMotta\\" compares the reel world vs. the real world from still photos and archival footage. It shows the detail that Scorsese and DeNiro went into to recreate the look and feel of the real fights. We also get the original theatrical trailer and a promo trailer for the Rocky boxed set.<br /><br />If you elect to go for the single disc edition of the film, all you'll get is a bare bones presentation. It does, however, sport the best transfer to date of the film presented in the correct aspect ratio (widescreen image heighth and width). It's a pity that MGM chose not to include the commentary tracks on this edition as they would have provided information every bit as useful as the extras on the deluxe edition.

1400032717|5.0|Fifteen-year-old Christopher is autistic, attends a special school, and lives with his father. He knows a great deal about Math. He uses his Math skills and \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" inspiration to track down the killer of his neighbor's dog. The story does not end after uncovering the killer. He discovers stark secrets concerning his parents and neighbors.<br /><br />The author has captured the innocence of childhood in this book. The book is well-written and touching. A definite page-turner. The narrative is first-person, and therefore, you get to know - how the mind of Christopher works. When the kid finds out the killer, he is in a state of panic and this is how he tries to maintain his composure: \\"I tried doubling 2s again but I couldn't get past 2(15) which was 32,728.\\"<br /><br />Christopher is always keen on finding some pattern that will enable him to make sense of the world. He thinks people in countryside may notice the grass and cows. Christopher would notice the number of black, brown, and white cows. He would notice the number of different types of grass.<br /><br />It was a lot of fun to read this book, even though, I skipped the Math problems he encounters because I am no good at Math :-)
0156027321|4.0|I had heard a lot about this book and everyone I knew raved about it.  So, I added it to my wish list and got it for the holidays.<br /><br />I must say, it starts off VERY slow.  I couldn't keep with it for the first 50 pages or so.  Then it picked up.  And I could not put the book down.  Between Pissing's (and I still crack up at the mention of his name and the happenings on the life boat) roving eye for religion and his journey for land -- you simply can't believe what you read.  Or can you?<br /><br />I am glad I stuck with it and read it through to the end!
B000007U6V|5.0|Autobahn is such an exquisite piece of electronic music that when I listen to it today in 2005, still sounds as futuristic and utterly modern than what some electronic bands could ever produce. You will absolutely not believe that this 22-minute classic was ever written and recorded in 1974 when computers hardly exist and tracks are recorded low-tech. The title track contain a few breaks, fully synthesized electronics and vocal effects that's way ahead of its time. The second and third tracks are ambiently atmospheric and breathtaking. This album goes to show that no one will ever forget how electronic music came to be today.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera is a beautiful movie.  From the beginning auction sequence that pulls you in to the last scene at Christine's grave, you don't want this movie to end.  I have always been a fan of the music and when I saw the trailer for the movie on TV before Christmas, I was eagerly awaiting this version.  I have to say I was a little disappointed in the lack of publicity for the movie.  I believe the studio must have spent the advertising money on Million Dollar Baby, but that's another story.  <br />   It is rare in a movie to find that all the characters click and are likable.  For me that happened in Pirates of the Caribbean and it happened big time in POTO.  I thought all the characters were great.  Emmy Rossum has taken a lot of criticism for being sort of blank and having a deer in the headlights look.  I think she was just reacting as most women would when in the presence of Gerard Butler as the Phantom.  He seems to elicit a jaw dropping reaction in most women who have seen the movie.  I think Christine and the Phantom had a tremendous amount of chemistry together and you can see why she was really torn and had such a hard time deciding between Raoul and Erik.  Emmy Rossum's voice was just perfect for this role and she was very pleasant to listen to. (both in the movie and on the soundtrack).  Gerard Butler is an actor who can sing and I think he did a great job.  You could see every emotion the Phantom was feeling and really sympathised with him at the end. I wanted to stand up and say, \\"The End\\", after the kiss.  I almost thought Christine was coming to her senses and staying with him when she came back to give him her ring.  Silly girl.  I think his Phantom will become the standard all future Phantoms are measured by.  For me, he was a much more intense, passionate Phantom than others in that role.  He was the object of everyone's attention, whether he was onscreen or not. <br />   Patrick Wilson did a great job as Raoul, which is pretty much a go-nowhere role.  He has a lovely voice and \\"Say You Love Me\\" was one of the prettiest songs in the movie.  I really didn't like his hair, though! <br />   The supporting actors were outstanding.  Miranda Richardson and Jennifer Ellison looked alike and were believable as mother and daughter.  Miranda R. really displayed anguish over the fate of the little boy she had rescued and the man she had protected.  Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow nearly stole the show as the \\"two fools\\" who ran the Phantom's theatre.  I loved the maestro and his little \\"You're fired\\" and \\"Bravo\\".  It was nice to see the woman who dubbed Minnie Driver's voice, especially in Il Muto.   <br />   This brings me to Minnie Driver and what I feel was an outstanding job.  She took an over-the-hill diva and embued her with likability even while she was a pain.  She was a pleasure to watch.  I especially liked her trying to hit Christine with her mask in \\"Masquerade\\".  I am disappointed that Ms. Driver will not be singing \\"Learn to Be Lonely\\" at the Oscars.  Do we really need Beyonce to sing another song??? <br />   This movie has generated a lot of fan reaction and will probably give several of the actors (particularly GB, who has Dear Frankie coming out shortly) a career boost.  Most people who have liked it have seen it multiple times and non-music people are even listening to the soundtrack.  It wasn't all the critic's cup of tea, but a lot of people have found real pleasure in this lovely movie.   <br />  That DVD can't get here soon enough.  I wish there were more than just 2 discs, though!  How about 4 or 5??  I'm sure there were lots of deleted Phantom scenes!!!
0451526384|3.0|Jane Austen wrote Persuasion as her last novel. She influenced her characters to be moderate people who lived within the same town as she grew up in. This town is to be called Bath. <br />     Anne, the main character of the novel, is the sister of Elizabeth and Mary. The family is well respected in town. They live with their father, Sir Walter Elliot, who without great thinking puts the family into dept. They then move to Bath and leave their house to Admiral and Mrs. Croft. Mrs. Croft is Captain Wentworth's sister, the man Anne had once fallen so deeply in love with. Anne goes and visits the Musgrove family where again she meets Captain Wentworth after not seeing him for so long. The Musgrove family, have two children and Captain Wentworth focuses his attention on one in particular. <br />    They travel to see another family in which Mr. Elliot falls in love with Anne. After only knowing her for a short period of time they later find out that they are cousins. Anne forgets about Captain Wentworth for awhile and focuses her attention on Mr. Elliot. They become engaged and Anne finds out Mr. Elliot's motives. Forgiving Mr. Elliot Anne stays with him. As time goes by she hears that Captain Wentworth proclaims that his love for her has never gone away. <br />    Jane Austen portrays the story as a love story but with a little twist and turn to it. Where family members fall in love and sides are taken. Based in the pas it has a present kind of love to it. Love triangles, family ties, and friendships that go on and off. <br />    Persuasion needs a lot of attention. You have to focus on the little details and be interested in old literature and the time period in which the book was based and written in. There were certain things that become uncertain and unclear to understand. <br />    The way Jane writes isn't really as typical as most books teenage children would read. She sets her stories on other books she has written and being sick while writing this book, it could have been a little better. Not to say it was a horrible book, but you really have to have the time and heart to read it. <br />     If you are a serious reader and can really get into a book, this is a good choice. It portrays a love story that could happen in today's society but has other aspects that allows you to know that it was set back in a time period when love wasn't the one thing everyone was looking for and willing to talk about. <br />
1567184855|5.0|I was amazed by this book which I highly recommend as very well worth getting.  It's that rare combination of a wonderfully informative and helpful book that is as spell-binding to read as a terrific novel.  Best of all, despite my extensive reading & experiences in this area and my knowledge of higher spiritual dimensions yet, this still greatly improved my understanding of how to work with the various aspects of Earth school to get the maximum benefits possible while here.  Although \\"Many Lives, Many Masters\\" by Dr. Weiss also was helpful & interesting & addresses similar topics, this book provides so much more information and at much greater depth that it was much more wonderful to read, so much so that I didn't want to put it down.  As an added bonus, it is nice and thick so your reading pleasure lasts that much longer.  The ongoing impact of this book on my life continues to amaze me, all the more so given how easy and enjoyable it was to read.  Thus it easily ranks in my top 5 books to read if you could only read a few.  The fact that I would need a lot of time to narrow down what else to include in my top 5 \\"not to miss\\" books in itself says what a special treasure this book is in every way.
0375759174|3.0|Doing It Gothic Style <br /> <br />NORTHANGER ABBEY <br />By: Jane Austen/Random House, Inc.  <br /> <br /> <br /> Catherine Morland was a young seventeen year old girl, growing up in a small village where she had about nine brothers and sisters, other than herself. Her mother was an ordinary woman who sometimes had too much to do, while her father was a clergyman. Just for the season, Catherine was invited by Mr. and Mrs. Allen to come with them to a town called Bath. At first, Mrs. Allen and Catherine are disappointed by the lack of acquaintances, even though they walk the town all day and go to the upper room and the lower rooms. Mrs. Allen had a sense for fashion and always had a beautiful dress on. Soon enough Catherine was introduced to Henry Tilney. However, as she started to develop a crush on him and looked forward to their meetings, he did not come around for a while. By a sudden twist of fate, she meets the Thorpe's. A family whom her brother knows because he had befriended their son and stayed with them for a summer .She quickly became friends with the eldest daughter, Isabella Thorpe. She had a grace and way about her that Catherine admired very much. She is the one who encourages Catherine's interest in romantic fantasies and gothic reading. Isabella also starts a love triangle between herself and James Morland, Catherine, John and Henry. For the first half it is nothing but parties and friendship. It is not until the second half of the book that Catherine is invited to the Tilney's house in Northanger Abbey, where she gets caught up in her own imagination and believes that in that house there has been a murder and the murderer still lives there. Just like in the gothic novels she had been reading. Unfortunately, she was kicked out by General Tilney himself later on. <br /> In the end, the book was about a girl who was nave, awkward and shy yet she had kindness in her heart and sometimes got lost in her own world sometimes seeing things that were nottrue. With all the books she read and believed in, her imagination would tend to catch up to her. <br /> Overall, this book was a three star because even though the story was a little plane at the beginning, it improved later on. It was a good read if you are into a corky story or like the old books written in the late eighteen hundreds or beginning nineteen hundreds. I would not however, recommend it to anyone seeking adventure. <br />By: Christina Menendez <br />
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This film is about the way a man's imagination can shape and define his life. That man, Edward Bloom (played brilliantly by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney) has a son named Will(Billy Crudup) who does not share his affinity for the fantastic.  When doctors find that Edward is dying, Will flies back home to be with the man he never understood, in some effort to know the man, and not the stories he told.  What Will learns throughout the course of the film is that the man is the stories he told.   <br /> <br />When Edward tells about the day that Will was born, he creates a story about a BIG FISH that he caught using his wedding ring as bait.  Will hates the story and knows the truth, that his father was a travelling salesman, and he was out of town when Will was born.  Edward adds color to the story because it means something to him, and the metaphor of the Big Fish is self-evident.  The two butt heads and try to reach accords up to the very end, which is very moving.  They are well supported by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman as the older and younger versions of Will's mother, and Edward's wife.  A scene toward the end of the movie involving Finney, Lange and a bathtub is one of the most touching in recent memory. <br /> <br />From amid all of the family strife and sadness surrounding the father's illness emerges a wondrous celebration of the human imagination and how it can make any moment special.  Truly a film for the ages.
B00005V1B2|4.0|Camel's delightful interpretation of Paul Galico's novel is a superb example of 1970's prog-rock at its most inventive. <br /> <br />Interspersing quiet, delicate, pseudo-classical passages with beautiful soaring guitar-work, the Snow Goose has a very different feel to the more visceral energy of Camel's previous album - Mirage.  The charm of the Snow Goose lies in the very powerful and memorable themes merged and reprised throughout the work (most notably in the core of tracks 3 to 6) and in Andy Latimer's virtuoso performance. If you enjoyed Gilmour's guitar outro to Floyd's Comfortably Numb, you will *love* this! <br /> <br />Some of the bonus tracks (single edits and live versions) seem a tad surperfluous here, in particular, the final track -  Freefall (taken from Mirage) reminds us why Camel were at their best when they skipped the vocals! <br /> <br />Still, this is a superb album that no prog-rock aficionado should be without. <br /> <br />I bought the Snow Goose at lunchtime. Listened to it on my long drive home after work, with a big smile on my face, and then woke up last night with the main theme of \\"Rhayader Goes to Town\\" stuck in my head. <br /> <br />Go on, treat yourself too!

1573228737|3.0|Irrefutably, Affinity is well-written, engrossing to read. It's a tour of Victorian England, particularly the spiritual \\"business,\\" through the protagonist's eyes. The emotions that the reader can feel through this exploration is ebb and flow. Miss Prior is flawed or she thinks she's flawed. So, the reader becomes her. And when she finds hope, the reader finds hope. The Author's style is that of journal-writing, in a way, it's epistolary.  This is where the secret of the writing lies, it is a vital style to use to unfold the whole story. Miss Dawes is an engaging counter-character. The \\"low\\" of the book is when I got depressed, not clinically, however, it renewed my fervor for writing. It reminded me why I persisted on being a writer.
B00005AFVR|3.0|While browsing at the record store, the other day I came to realize that I did not own \\"Live in New York City\\".  I felt it necessary to hear some live E-Street Band action so I picked it up and listened.  I was sucked in from the start with \\"My Love Will Not Let You Down\\" which was an awesome way to kick things off.  The band sounds passionate and energized.  It shows for the remainder of Disc One, with a variety of Springsteen classics.  One thing I liked was it was not a greatest hits live set, it really covers a lot of other songs mostly.  But I did have major issues with the new \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\".  If you have the band to back you, I don't understand why you wouldn't give it the sound it was meant to have.  Disc Two is where the flaws really come in to play.  \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\" is fun and Springsteen's gospel-like rock sermon is certainly inspired but 16 minutes?????  That is a little much.  I never liked \\"American Skin\\" not only for its political message but I really just don't think the song is all that great.  \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" however, is excellent. But unfortunately when Disc One is great, Disc Two falls flat for the most part.  An epic performance of \\"Jungleland\\" (my favorite Springsteen song) gets things back to where they need to be and the remainder of the album is enjoyable.  Is the album worth it?  If your a fan, yes.  There are definately some must have moments on the set. It could have been better, but it is still Springsteen live with the E-Street Band and that is never a bad thing at all.
B00063EMJG|5.0|This album starts off w/one of my favorite Neil Young songs.  Actually there's not a bad song on the whole thing.  Although I do have to point out a review earlier said something along the lines of \\"what took Neil so long to put out a greatest hits album\\".  Apparently they've never heard about Decade.  A 3 disk set done earlier on in his career.  And as far as the DVD bein not the best quality I have a couple of things to say on that.  Since when was Neil about quality?  Neil does what he feels right.  Not what the industry wants.  So if you're familiar w/Neil's craziness I would definatley recommend the DVD.  And the second point is other than the videos (there's only two) does it really matter?  I don't know if I was doin somethin wrong but other than the videos all I was doin was watchin a record player play the various songs on the album.  Why do you need \\"great\\" quality for that?  Although I do have to admit this set is missing a couple of songs that I would have liked to hear (My My Hey Hey and This Notes For You), but it does state on the album that the songs were chosen by requests, album purcheses, and most popular downloads.  So if there is a song that you want on here that's not on, you only have yourself to blame for not asking to hear more of it.  Anyway...buy the album w/the DVD.  It's good stuff.  If you want high quality DVD's buy Shindlers List.  If you want older Neil buy Decade.
B000000YG5|5.0|Of all the great jazz tenor saxophonists in existence presently and before, Sonny Rollins has always been my favorite.  I guess I really just always digged his rough, deep sound and his endless array of ideas.  Being that he is my favorite tenor player, \\"Saxophone Colossus\\" has always been one of my favorite albums ever since the first time I heard it.  This group (Sonny, the superb Tommy Flanagan,Doug Watkins on bass, and the incredible Max Roach on drums)  works so well together, I really feel that they should've become a working group or at least have recorded one more time together.  Every single track has a different style but are all equally compelling.  \\"St. Thomas\\" , without a doubt the famous composition on this album and probably that Sonny ever did, is truly one of the catchiest themes in existence.  Sonny's solo on this cut is truly a classic now and is essential listening for all jazz saxophonists to listen to how to handle a latin tune such as this.  Tommy Flanagan and Max Roach also have extended, very impressive solos which are some of the best I've ever heard them do.  \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" is a beautiful ballad that became much more popular as a result of this recording.  Sonny's solo, although humorous, has a certain sadness to it.  The somewhat gentle mood is continued greatly in Flanagan's solo and the track concludes in a very emotional finale.  \\"Strode Rode\\" swings extremely hard and shows all present at their very best.  \\"Moritat\\" (more commonly known as \\"Mack the Knife\\") is a very popular show tune that you are probably familiar with even if you haven't heard this cd.  Of all the many versions done of this tune, Sonny's is by far the best.  The album then concludes with \\"Blue 7\\", which is the most influential composition on this cd due to the fact that it single-handedly introduced the concept of thematic improvisation.  All four members of the ensemble provide nice, laid-back, dreamy solos that brings the album to a quiet close.  Ifyou don't already own this cd, you probably feel that this cd could never possibly live up to all the hype.  This is one of the rare cases where every good thing said about this awesome cd is completely justified.  In my opinion, this is definitely in the top five most essential and greatest jazz albums ever, so pick it up now if you consider yourself a fan of any jazz or music in general.
0811806405|5.0|Guitarmaking: Tradition and Technology is a valuable reference for luthiers, and I think the current renaissance in guitarmaking by amateurs and professionals owes much to its publication. The book's stance is clearly \\"old school,\\" and it shows how to make the entire guitar by hand, from scratch, right down to the bracing and the kerfed liner. While I myself have little to no intention of hand-sawing my own kerfed lining any time soon, I am nonetheless gratified to have on hand a reference work that would assist me in doing so if I wanted to.   <br /> <br />Some of the methods described in this book do seem outdated.  To an extent that is because the craft has continued to blossom since the publication of Cumpiano's book. And yet if I could have only a single book on the subject it would be this one. (It is sort of like the lutherie equivalent of THE JOY OF COOKING.) One true weakness of the book that other reviewers have pointed out is the side-by-side coverage of steel string and classic guitar construction. I think these two subjects would be better addressed in separate volumes, ideally with discussion on the multiple ways to perform tasks such as joining the neck to the body or bending the sides.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Seeing this movie on December 24th was a great early Christmas present for me!  I had seen the stage production in Seattle about a year and a half prior to seeing the film and although I absolutely loved the stage production, I was not at all disappointed with the movie.  Of course, between what I saw on stage (not the original) and the film, the singers/actors could never replace Michael Crawford & Sarah Brightman, but I was very impressed with the actors' singing. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this movie yet and it's still playing near you, I say go out there now and see it.  Otherwise, wait until it comes out on DVD and watch it at home!
B0002VJIGY|3.0|As far as the acting goes, I thought this was very well acted, but the one sticking point I had was the whole love triangle between Valjean, Cosette, and Marius.  I have read the unabridged version (one of my favorite books) and I never got such a thing from the book.  I don't think that Valjean ever loved Cosette in a romantic way, but did want her for himself in a selfish way, for the love (non-romantic and very fatherly) that he did have for her.  This was one of the several tests that Valjean goes through during the novel.  If you really read the novel you will find it is more about Valjean being tested to go back on his promise to change his life than anything else.  He always makes the right choice, even after trying to convince himself otherwise.  Such is the case with saving Marius and allowing the marriage.  He does it for her good then withdraws from her life in order not to tarnish her promising future with his ugly past.  I have yet to see a movie that really portrays this central theme of Valjean enduring to the end with his conviction to be an honest man, with the ultimate test being separating himself from his daughter.  Trying to make him romantically inclined towards the daughter he raised seems just weird and wrong to me anyway - must be a French thing.
B000002B2T|5.0|In the year of 1995, the world has been gifted with this music masterpiece. Mad Season's \\"Above\\" is an unique album, with flawless songs, which leads you, somehow, to another state of mind while you're through it. <br />The hypnotic and smoothly-screaming voice of Layne Staley makes you feel numb and relaxed. <br />I'd recommend you to get home, put this CD on, turn off all the lights, lay down in your bed/couch, and let all your senses fall away, as the music slowly takes you to a far distant place.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|You'll find pure listening pleasure here featuring some great supporting musicians complimenting the best voice in music today in my opinion.

B00005JNEI|4.0|I don`t find this as good as his earlier efforts Roger & Me and Bowling for Colombine. However, he is obviously needed in a country where FOX dominates the media.  <br />His methods are a bit crude, but nowhere near as crude as the methods of the Bush administration. From where I`m sitting (Northern Europe), it is immensely frightening that the babbling monkey who got crushed by Kerry in all debates got a clear majority of the votes.  <br />Why, America? Anti-intellectualism? Fear of the big bad terrorists(the people here comparing Moore to Goebbels should consider how this statistically completely irrational fear is exploited methodically by Bush in every speech he makes)? Sheer stupidity? <br /> <br />Why is it that the US spends enormous sums trying to salvage an arbitrary middle-eastern dictatorship (f.ex Saudi-Arabia, home of the hijackers, are just as bad) while millions are dying of war and starvation in Africa without as much as a squeak from Dubya? Use your brains, people. Blind patriotism is no patriotism at all.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION OF RAY MEMORABILIA AND CONSIDER IT A GLORIOUS ADDITION!
0316172324|3.0|Well, as a huge fan of Gladwell's last book, The Tipping Point, I was excited last week to finally get my hands on his new effort: Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. This time around Gladwell's basic thesis is that often snap judgements (what he calls \\"thin slicing\\") can be more accurate than well researched, careful analysis. Gladwell uses many examples (most are interesting) to demonstrate this behavior such as determining when art is faked, sizing up car buyers, picking presidential candidates and determining the characteristics of a person by observing their living space. This has always been Gladwell's talent: taking just-under-the-radar topics and bringing them into the public's view through great journalism and storytelling. <br /> <br />Gladwell is also careful to examine the flipside of this phenomenon: the times when \\"thin slicing\\" misleads us or gives us the wrong results. For instance, he presents examples where the mind works based on biases that don't necessarily enter the realm of conscious thought, but are nevertheless there (age, race, height, and so on). <br /> <br />It's a great topic and Gladwell sets it up with some wonderful examples, but then the book begins to have problems. First, the book is a little too anecdotal. Anyone who has ever had a 200-level psych class knows that what looks like cause and effect may be accounted for by an independent variable that wasn't considered (e.g., concluding cancer rates are higher in some area of the country because of pollution, when in fact the area has higher smoking rates as well). Given this, I found that too often conclusions are made on basic handwaving, or that important aspects of studies are not mentioned. For instance, Gladwell describes a study were observers are asked to determine certain characteristics (such as truthfulness, consciensciousness, etc.) of students by observing their dorm rooms; but, never does he mention how exactly one would determine these characteristics of individuals in a scientific manner for comparison. Such omissions leave the reader a little less than convinced. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, even with this flaw the first third of the book supports the thesis and makes for the usual entertaining reading; but things derail from there. The examples start to seem more peripheral: a rogue commander beating the conventional forces in a war game exercise, an artist known as Kenna who apparently should have made it big but didn't (why this example is interesting I've yet to figure out), and some rehash about coke vs pepsi from one of his older articles. <br /> <br />By the end of the book the whole thing derails into examples that just don't seem appropriate for the topic. Sure a study of why Pepsi always does better than Coke in blind tastes tests is interesting (and you can read his article on this without buying the book on Gladwell's web site), but does a study of \\"sips\\" vs \\"whole-can drinking\\" - people prefer sweet for sips (Pepsi) - really say something about unconscious rapid cognition? <br /> <br />One of Gladwell's greatest strengths is in recognizing interesting things, and then bringing them into conscious awareness so we actually realize these things are happening (whether it be tipping points or rapid cognition). I think he's partly achieved that in this book, but it doesn't come together the way the Tipping Point does. One gets the idea that this topic may have been better handled in an article rather than a full blown book.

B00005OCMR|4.0|First released in 1982, Tron was one of the first movies to rely heavily on computer animation for its special effects.  Although nowhere near the standards of today's films, the animation and special effects are still very good, and the scenes are extremely well-done. <br /> <br />As for the movie itself, Jeff Bridges stars as Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer for a large company.  Kevin was dismissed by his boss, Ed Dillinger (David Warner), for unknown reasons.  It turns out that Dillinger stole several game programs that were written by Flynn and used them as his own.  He didn't even change the names on them.  Meanwhile, Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) is another programmer working in the same company.  He has developed a computer program called Tron, which will be able to oversee the company's \\"Master Control Program\\" and monitor its actions. <br /> <br />Dillinger is highly opposed to Tron.  He wrote the MCP himself, but now the MCP is taking on characteristics of its own and becoming more powerful each day.  It even has aspirations of tapping into the Pentagon and the Kremlin. <br /> <br />Flynn is determined to prove that his work was stolen by Dillinger, so he plans to hack into the MCP along with Bradley and Lora (Cindy Morgan) to retrieve his work.  However, as he is attempting to break in, the MCP sucks all of them inside.  Once inside, the group must literally \\"play\\" the games designed by Flynn in order to survive against the MCP.  Will the group survive against the all-mighty MCP, or will the MCP destroy them? <br /> <br />I thought this was a very entertaining movie.  The special effects, although dated, are still very good.  The light cycles, tanks, and recognizers are high points and bring back lots of memories for me when I used to play the Tron video games at the arcade.  Bridges, Boxleitner, Morgan, and Warner do good jobs of acting as well.  I recommend this film highly.  It was a forerunner to many of today's highly successful computer animation films and helped place Disney at the forefront of the computer animation industry.  Watch and see the heroes decide the fate of both the electronic and real worlds.
B000002HH2|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this CD, Bjork's Icelandic dialogue <br />is awesome, especially on \\"The Modern Things\\", I can listen to this album over and over again while I drive.  Relaxing.  I am POST'ed for a while.  :)  \\"I Miss You\\" has a fantastic beat to it, imagine missing someone you haven't met yet.  Bjork's lyrics <br />are very creative and imaginative, I am glad I have all of her music in my collection for days when I want to relax and hear her angelic voice.  This is a great CD to hear after a stressful day.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|yea this movie was tight, and had alot of good car chasing scene, the first one I thought was better but i still like this one, and like the whole movie Jason Bourne never talks, but I liked alot.
B0007GADZO|4.0|Some may not like the experimentation on this album, or the direction he goes in. I like this better, best album since The Ultra Zone IMHO. His signing is improving, but I feel that sometimes he recycles melodies from his past disography. I'd liek to see him really go out and do a totally different guitar stle. Challenge himself and his audience. Mostly the cd is good, there are one or two stinkers, but nothing that ruins the cd. I love experimentation, so maybe that's why I like this. Plus the fact that Vai actually knows how to use Pro-Tools, unlike many bands. He has good tone, but on a few songs, it again seems recycled. I liked track 3 the most simply because it was effects he never used before. <br />   I hope he continues to expand. I see him perform in April, so I'll see how it sounds live. I will be excited. <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|First off, I have to confess, I am not a huge consumer of music. I have my stash of 300+ CDs that have accumulated and served me well through the years--most purchased before 1990. Secondly, I generally find the music played on \\"pop radio\\" despicable--most of today's music strikes me as awful, overproduced, hideous bubblegum nonsense that makes the Bay City Rollers look downright dignified.<br /><br />Keane's debut album has blown me away. I purchased it solely on the strength of their live performance on SNL, and later was astounded to learn that the only OTHER artist whose albums I've purchased since the turn of the millenium (Rufus Wainwright) is actually opening for them right now on tour in Europe.<br /><br />This CD is on constantly in my car. It's impossible not to love this music. It catches in your synapses and stays there. The album's pure, spare, melodic, honest compositions soar.<br /><br />Very few things through the years have dragged me out of my old, tired \\"comfort zone\\" in music. Hopes and Fears did that and put me on the lookout for this band's next album.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and meet a new favorite.
B00023B1LC|5.0|The Bourne Identity is a great spy thriller. Keeps you guessing & on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon is perfect as Jason Bourne. Damon pulls off a character that is smart but lost, composed but confused, lethal but child like. From the minute the fishermen fished him out of the Mediteranian Sea & finds out he can't recall who he is. Then finding out thru a capsule implanted in his body...only a bank account in Zurich. Once Bourne gets to the Bank of Zurich all hell breaks loose. Franka Potente as Maria, the German gypsie, is very good. This movie is an excellent action spy thriller that I would recomend to all to see.
B000002B35|4.0|The title I gave my review for Delicate Sound Of Thunder was \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason: Improved Version.\\"  So this is very similar to DSOT, but all in all, it is better.  For example, Pulse doesn't include The Dogs Of War, and Another Brick In The Wall (Part II) has a sort of The Happiest Days Of Our Lives intro.  It also incudes Dark Side Of The Moon in it's entirety, which is neat-o torpedo.  This also has my favorite recording of Wish You Were Here.  The crowd singing along makes it very powerful-ish.  If you are looking for the best Floyd album, get Is There Anybody Out There?  But if you don't want that, get Ummagumma.  Now if that's not what you want, get Pulse.  The End.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|One of Hitch's best! Roger Thornhill is no more a secret-agent than he is a brain-surgeon and yet he gets so believably swept into this suspenseful drama that you might think that you have missed something early on! The superb direction of Alfred Hitchcock combines perfectly with the Academy Award nominated screenplay of Ernest Lehman. The performances of Cary Grant,Eve Marie Saint,and James Mason are equally superb!
B000002A3T|4.0|Basically The Division Bell sounds like David Gilmour and gang were like, \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason was lame.  Let's make a cool version of it, but do it seven years later.  We can make it a concept album, but make it difficult for our listeners to figure it out...and we won't be musically original.  We could use the sounds that all the other 90s bands are using and be real user-friendly.  Alrighty chaps!\\"  So that might have been how TDB happened.  Maybe not, but I thought that was funny.  This is good, but like...not, but okay...and stuff.  Oh well, I'll give it four stars.  Anything is good compared to AMLOR!!!
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|This was nothing compared to the first film (The Bourne Identity). All we see are 108 minutes of Jason Bourne running around Germany. There's only about 15 minutes of action, and it's at the end of the film. We also do not learn anything about him, except that he killed two people. Also, is it just me, or was the camerawork in this film annoying? The cameraman needs to be fired. I could not follow any scenes with even remote action. It seemed as though they were trying to fit every angle into every shot. The camerawork was so damn bad, that you couldn't follow the story, which is probably how I wound up with my conclusion that hardly anything happens. However, from what I seen (yes, I did pay attention to the film), hardly ANYTHING happened. This film has the worst cinematography I've EVER seen (and that's saying ALOT), and this film is one of the most PLOTLESS films I've ever seen.<br /><br />The first film outshines this one by a mile.<br /><br />I also relied on what the critics said when I rented this, but after viewing it, I regret doing so.<br /><br />The camera work in this movie is enough to give you motion sickness. This is a 108 minute movie based on a very short plot. The filming will leave you with a headache as the camera is constantly shaking as if you were running with the characters or riding in a car on a very bumpy road. I could not enjoy the story because the camera work was so bad that it distracted from the movie. I don't know how the movie has received such a high rating. With the camera jumping around so much it was visually distracting so much that you can not enjoy it. I have the first one on DVD but I will not buy this one.<br /><br />They should've used a SteadyCam.<br />The cinematography gives a new meaning to \\"Sh-Sh-Shake it like a Polaroid picture!\\" (HAHAHA. Okay, yeah, that was bad.)<br /><br />Okay, I know you're saying \\"ENOUGH ABOUT THE CAMERAWORK!\\".<br />Julia Stiles was great for the screen time she was given. There was only one good \\"thrilling\\" scene, which is:<br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />When he's going to snipe the woman who is after him while talking to her on the cell phone.<br /><br />In Supremacy, Jason Bourne seemed to me to be weak, not at smart as he was in the first. It was like he had lost his edge. He wasn't spouting random information, like in Identity. He only REALLY used his lightening fast fighting skills 2 times. And once, that was with a guy who had his hands together. And it still took Jason about 4 minutes to beat the guy. For a while, the handcuffed guy was beating Jason! Had it been in Identity, Jason would've kicked his butt in 5 seconds.<br /><br />This film was a disappointment.*  When he's going to snipe the woman who is after him while talking to her on the cell phone.

B0000026NC|4.0|I like to think of this as the improved version of A Momentary Lapse Of Reason.  It's got the highlights from that album and the best songs from the rest of their career.  The biggest issue I have with this is David Gilmour's vocals on some of the songs (ex. Another Brick In The Wall).  Besides that, it's pretty cool.  Probably my favorite song on here is One Of These Days.  In my opinion, it's superior to the Meddle version.  Another problem I have is Money.  I don't like hearing this song live.  If you've heard the Pulse version, it's basically the same.  It just has too much of that \\"hoo\\" vocal stuff on it.  Anywho, besides whatever, this is a pretty decent album.  If you had to pick between this or AMLOR, go with this.
0783240236|4.0|The Birds just might be the scariest movie I have ever seen. Bodega Bay is under seige by a strange adversary; and no one ever knows why. Classic Hitchcock tale, a most original concept; not equalled before or since. This is Tippi Hedren's first film, and nothing short of a gripping mystery. Amazingly enough, it was the animators of Walt Disney that made the fireplace sequence possible
B0002ZMITY|3.0|sure, Ali G Indahouse is kinda absurd & nowhere in the same league as his vastly superior show on HBO, but that still didn't stop me from busting a gut here & there. For all I know, maybe the absurdity is deliberate...y'know, maybe the movie was supposed to have been written from the mind of \\"Ali G\\" instead of Sacha Baron Cohen, kinda like a bigger-budget \\"Spys\\" (a cheesy movie Ali G pitched on one of his HBO episodes). Fans of BBC's \\"The Office\\" will barely recognize Martin Freeman as one of Ali G's poseur homeys...between Tim Canterbury and this role, let's just say Freeman's pretty much covered both sides of the spectrum and then some. And Rhona Mitra (the original Lara Croft, for those unaware) is most definitely easy on the eyes, and to my suprise she brought some game with her acting chops. Ali G Indahouse is worthy of at least a rental IMO, after that you can draw your own conclusion whether to buy it or not.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The Pianist is the true story of a Polish Jewish pianist named Szpielman, who had a bright future ahead of him - until the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939. From that point forward, Szpielman and his family endured the Nazi repression of the Jews and ultimate confinement to the Warsaw ghetto. Upon losing his family to the death camps yet miraculously being himself spared the same fate, Szpielman's struggle turns into one of survival as he attamps to avoid the Nazis and the simultaneous destruction of Warsaw during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> The story is beyond inspirational, there is truly something to be learned from it. A man who literally lost everything, yet in the end still had his dignity and his passion, perhaps the only thing that kept him alive. It is the triumph of a man in the face of great adversity. The movie itself provides a distinct, unique viewpoint of the environment and events in Warsaw during the war, with great pictoral effect as well as accuracy. From an historical standpoint the film is right on the money, and doesn't sacrifice anything. The acting is also superb, particularly with Adrien Brody as Szpielman.  <br /> <br />Truly a great film and an amazing story. Highly recommended.
B000003CMC|5.0|Eat A Peach is the Allman Brothers' fourth album and along with their previous live release At Fillmore East cemented their legend. During the recording of this album, the band was dealt a devastating blow when their founder and guitarist Duane Allman was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident. With heavy hearts, the remaining members completed the album, even writing three more tunes for the release that were among their best work. Therefore, while At Fillmore East showed a phenomenal live band at the height of their powers, Eat A Peach shows this as well as the band's improved songwriting skills on the studio cuts, in effect creating one of the best albums ever released in American music.<br /><br />The album's opening track \\"Ain't Wasting Time No More\\" is a eulogy to their fallen leader. Gregg Allman's lyrics and somber vocals along with Dickey Betts' slide guitar are a fitting tribute to Duane. \\"Les Brers In A Minor\\" is one of their best instrumentals right alongside the more acclaimed \\"In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed\\" and \\"Jessica.\\" Gregg Allman's \\"Melissa\\" is a great country tune that has become one of the band's most endearing songs. The remaining three studio tracks were cut with Duane Allman and show the band exploring different avenues. \\"Stand Back\\", highlighted by Duane's slide guitar, is one of their funkiest tracks. Betts' \\"Blue Sky\\" would not only contain his first lead vocal but also provide a prelude to the country-rock that would play a large part on their future albums. \\"Little Martha\\" is a tender acoustic ballad with just Duane and Dickey. The live tracks are pure gold. It's rare that a band could take a cover song and perform it so well that they literally make it their own. Amazingly, the band does it here twice with their versions of Elmore James' \\"One Way Out\\" and Muddy Waters' \\"Trouble No More.\\" While both songs stay somewhat true to the original, it's the band's interplay that brings both these tracks to new heights. Then at last there's \\"Mountain Jam\\", 33 minutes of musical heaven where the band takes the improvisation of jazz to new heights without ever being overindulgent. The track is similar to watching a classic movie in that you pick up something new everytime you listen to it. This album should be part of every music fan's collection. Highly recommended.Mountain Jam\\", 33 minutes of musical heaven where the band takes the improvisation of jazz to new heights without ever being overindulgent.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|As other reviewers have noted, this KINO release is the most complete and restored version of the movie that exists.  The storylines make a lot more sense, and the video quality is excellent.  I have to confess that I miss the wailing rock soundtrack from the earlier, less complete version of the film.  Overall though, the musical score fit the film quite well, and like everything else in this film, it was reconstructed to be as close as possible to the original.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Sometimes the mind has tunnel vision. But details need to be ingrained.<br /><br />\\"Saw\\" is a no bones, graphic crime thriller. Knowing that going into view this film can only lead to predictable assumptions. Who is the Killer? That question is always in the viewer's mind. As a side note: Your first instinct is usually right!<br /><br />Director James Wan plays with those viewer's assumptions. \\"Saw\\" is about a sadistic serial killer with a conscience on changing his victim's outlook. This is a great story with many twists and options to play with as a scriptwriter. Will you make a drastic decision to save your life?<br /><br />\\"Saw\\" starts out with a great premise but ends with the believable factor. How much time would it take to set up these elaborate scenarios with life choice decisions?  The plot is intertwined in massive coincidence of circumstances. The inept detectives (Danny Glover/Ken Leung) round out the mislead manhunt.  Hopefully the sequel will be better. But worth viewing to find out who is the killer!
B000056K04|4.0|Despite all the stuff they went through during this album it came out to be their best one yet.  All the hype about it being boring and empty is a lie, this album is complete.  Not one song is longer than five minutes but that's okay, every song is a good one.  <br />  I highly recommend it, and the only reason it doesn't have five stars is because it's not live, if were live I'd give it five, because DMB is better live.
B00006CXSS|5.0|\\"Band of Brothers\\" is the most in-depth attempt by a film to depict the experience of a infantry rifleman in sustained modern combat.  It faithfully follows Stephen Ambroses' wonderful book of the same title, tracing a company of paratroopers from the training camp at Toccoa to the end of the war at Hitler's mountain retreat in the Bavarian Alps.  It benefits from an impeccable cast, modern post-Private Ryan battle effects, and incredible attention to detail.  This is a grognard's must-have.  And, like its soulmate \\"Private Ryan\\", due to its realism it renders most earlier and less-sophisticated WW2 films nearly unwatchable.<br /><br />Company E (Easy), 506th Airborne Regiment participated in the three pivotal battles of the Western European Campaign in World War II: D-Day, Market Garden (the failed attempt to seize the Rhine River crossing in Holland), and at the siege of Bastogne during Hitler's December 1944 Ardennes Offensive.  Because of their status as elite troops, the paratroopers were cold-bloodedly employed longer in battle, and against greater odds, than most equivalent units.  A point made repeatedly in the film is the enormous turnover caused by casualties, as more and more of the long-term characters we become comfortable with are wounded, killed, or incapacitated by combat stress.  Yet these troops were consistently thrown into the breach because of their reliability and lethal commitment to survive.<br /><br />The most valuable aspect of the film, which is not peopled by big-name actors, is in portraying the plight of line infantrymen.  The American method of waging war whether in World War II, Korea and especially Vietnam, imposed the burden of ground combat on a minority of units and individual soldiers at any given time.  What happens to these soldiers is the stuff of Band of Brothers - and if this is the fate of elite troops, one can only imagine how more standard units filled with a mix of draftees and enlisted men fared.  Ambroses's book and the movie follow the progression from the gung-ho D-Day battles to the first setback at Einhoven, and the frozen, starved soldiers torn apart by German artillery at Bastogne.  Ultimately, some of these soldiers crack, and company commanders finally refuse to take risks pre-empting higher authority.<br /><br />The book and film are both a \\"Greatest Generation\\" tribute and a lesson, in a way, a powerful anti-war statement of their own.  Ambrose's moral is that every soldier, no matter how well trained or elite, has a \\"breaking point\\" beyond which he or she should not be expected to endure.  The realties of modern war are such that unless the combat experience is in the context of a \\"splendid little war\\" such as Panama or the 1991 Gulf War, human beings were not meant to be exposed to a constant lethal environment for months on end.  Seemingly this lesson has to be re-learned in every sustained war, including the one we are now in.<br /><br />Must Read:  Stepehn Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers\\" and related titles.

I am normaly not a love story sappy person. not that there is anything wrong with them i am just not the person who normaly rents them. But I did this one, it was great I was so blown away by the story that I had to go buy it. My husband got chills from the story and he hates love stories. I know quite a few people who said the cried. But the other thing is it is not a story that leaves you upset all day. when and if you cry about it , its not like your dog got ran over kind of thing. It is a great movie and the story is well written.
B0007GADZO|3.0|I've been a Steve Vai fan for almost twenty years, and I consistently find his playing exciting, emotional, and well-composed.  \\"Real Illusions\\" aspires to be a concept album, but I'm not sure exactly what the concept is besides the idea that spirituality should triumph over selfishness.  That said, the music is incredible as always.  Vai plays with a particularly wide range of grooves and tempos this time, and his guitar solos continue to grow.  No other guitarist I can think of has such great control of distortion, attack, and decay of his notes and Vai's attention to the details of each note makes his playing utterly unique.  I also think his singing has made great improvement since the first solo album, and I find that he sounds very good here even though the lyrics don't always make much sense.  One glaring problem is the production.  While Vai's guitar always sounds unique and Billy Sheehan's bass is typically wild, the keyboard sounds used on the album are particularly digital and cold.  I don't think this is a Tony MacAlpine issue as all Vai's albums have sounded this way since \\"Fire Garden.\\"  I wouldn't suggest he necessarily go retro and use Hammond organ everywhere, but some improvement in the warmth and variety of keyboard sounds would be welcomed.  I wonder if it sounded great on the studio monitors but not so good on an average stereo system.  In any event, Vai won't likely make any new converts with this record, but it should be well-received by those who have already been seduced by the charms of his music.   <br />
B00009L1TA|3.0|Director John McTiernan's \\"Basic\\" highlights the team of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson working together for the first time since their blockbuster \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"  Initially it appears that they are polar opposites with Travolta playing a seemingly laid back, unconventional Drug Enforcement Agency agent and Jackson as a no nonsense, spit and polish disciplinarian Army Ranger sergeant.   <br /> <br />Set in Panama, the film is all about appearances and reality as emotions shift back and forth as do opinions with the story being framed in a series of flashbacks representing various viewpoints.  Jackson has supposedly been killed by one or more of his men after a rain-soaked war drill in the jungle.  Travolta, who had served under Jackson as a Ranger, is called in to question the initial prime suspect in the sergeant's death.   <br /> <br />Travolta immediately encounters resistance from provost marshal's office representative Connie Nielsen, who believes in following formal procedures, a technique anathema to the highly unconventional Travolta.  At one point when she is shouting at the suspect in an attempt to break him down, Travolta infuriates Nielsen by telling him that he will not insult his intelligence by engaging in a typical \\"good cop-bad cop\\" dialogue. <br /> <br />The investigators soon learn that there is a drug smuggling operation occurring on the base.  What makes matters even more ticklish is that the ringleader is none other than the officer in charge of the hospital, played by Harry Connick Jr., who also happens to be Nielsen's steady love interest.  When attention shifts to another suspect it is learned that he is the gay son of a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  \\"There goes don't ask, don't tell,\\" Travolta quips after the suspect reveals his sexual preference. <br /> <br />The contrast between the loose and freewheeling Travolta and the military formality of Jackson and Nielsen gives the story a lot of its dramatic punch.  Long before thesurprise twist ending the audience is aware that the main story ploy relates to appearances and reality and to not believe what one hears before plenty of corroboration.
B0006399FS|1.0|The U2 mystery has gone. Apart from being a quartet of forty-something blokes with the same trademark guitars and an immense back catalogue, their purpose seems unclear.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this dull album shows this lack of purpose to have reached crippling levels. At times it's as if as the band, lost as to their true identity, start playing what they think U2 should be playing. It sounds so familiar. No substance at all. It's just marketing, fashion, Grammy Awards, etc. The album quickly descends into an uninspiring mid-tempo plod. <br /> <br />The overall impression is that they've forgotten about the songs and preoccupied themselves worrying about the textures. Stuck between second-guessing their audience's expectations and where they actual want to travel, they end up in a cul-de-sac of their own making.  <br /> <br />Stuck In A Moment They Don't Want To Get Out Of. <br /> <br />
B00008G9JO|5.0|\\"Heavy Horses\\" released in 1978, a successor of what I call Jethro Tull's best album \\"Songs from the wood\\" continued the band's folk-rock direction. Well, one may argue Jethro Tull was a folk-rock group almost from the start but in late 70's they went folkier and w hich resulted two of their most loved albums...absolutely astounding \\"Songs from the wood\\" and \\"Heavy Horses\\". Eventually this was the first Jethro Tull album I listened (almost 10 years back) and had mixed feeling about the album but now I consider it great and one the best in their catalogue. <br /> <br />The songs are lilting, playful and tasty. \\"Acres Wild\\" must be the first Tull songs I really liked with funny but simplistic lyrics like  <br />\\"I'll make love to you in all good places <br />under black mountains in open spaces. <br />By deep brown rivers that slither darkly <br />through far marches where the blue hare races. <br />Come with me to the Winged Isle, northern father's western child. <br />Where the dance of ages is playing still <br />through far marches of acres wild.\\" <br /> <br />It is still my favorite from the album but who can forget gems like  <br />\\"Rover\\", which has some wonderful flute work by Ian Anderson. <br />\\"Moths\\", which takes me 10 years back, a guy (me) newly introduced to the band experiencing one of strangest things in the world, Ian Anderson growling vocal and tantalizing flute. <br />\\"Heavy Horses\\", the epic sounding track of the album... <br /> <br />They all are good and oh yes, flute is the backbone of this album. So if you like to listen Anderson playing more flutes,  then get this album along with 'Divinities', his fully instrumental classical solo effort. This is one of my favorite JT album, I like \\"Songs from the wood\\", \\"Thick as a brick\\", \\"Stand Up\\" more than this in the entire JT catalogue. So that is reason enough for me to call it ESSENTIAL. <br /> <br />(This review is for the version without the bonus tracks)
B0006ZE7G2|1.0|As others have said, instead of trying to sell us the same thing in a different cover, we're much more likely to part with our money if you give us something we havn't been able to see before. <br /> <br />Many of the Wall live dates were filmed for a possible video release. Put this on a DVD and I will buy it. Re-release next year on HD-DVD and I'll probably buy it again. <br />
0767834739|3.0|Hot on the heels of Dawn of the Dead remake and well past our memory retention for it's original, RE: Apocalypse picks up right about where the first one left off.  This time, it's an entire city that's being brought down by a virus invested population instead of a claustrophobic high tech lab.<br /><br />A recap voice over given by Alice (in Wonderland?), played by Milla Jovovich gives the update we need even if we had released what little emotional attachment we had to the first one.  I give high kudos for the creators in making a movie that actually surpasses the first one in production value and action thrills.  The first was more of a suspense movie, which is fine because the suspense of what they discovered in the first one is gone.  We know what they are up against.<br /><br />This one is actually more like the video game, an action shoot-em-up where the popular characters come together to fight the `Evil'.  I'm not familiar with the characters from the game but I was intrigued when I saw Jill Valentine smoke up the screen.  Nothing better then to put a hot female cop in a mini skirt, black go-go boots and corset with guns strapped to her hips.  Hello Nurse!<br /><br />Anyway, the situation in the movie goes from bad to worse as the virus catches up with almost all the characters introduced.  Only a few remain at the end and the finale is actually pretty impressive with a shameless introduction for a third installment.  All in all, this is a good sequel and a great popcorn/action/horror flick with only passable dialogue but well done action sequences and thrills to spare.
6304698526|3.0|There are really only two reasons to see this movie: Steve McQueen as Frank Bullitt, and the famous car chase. Other than that, it's pretty thin stuff. <br /> <br />Despite the conceit, much-ballyhooed in the 1968 \\"Steve McQueen's Commitment to Reality\\" short feature, included on the DVD, that Bullitt is a \\"real world\\" police procedural, the plot has holes in it you could drive a 1968 Mustang GT through. For instance, one of the story's major \\"surprises\\" depends on San Francisco PD Homicide NOT instantly fingerprinting and IDing the body in a major gangland hit. <br /> <br />It's ludicrous when Bullitt tells a police evidence technician to fingerprint stuff he and his partner have just spent minutes pawing over - without wearing gloves, even. Oy gevalt! <br /> <br />Toward the end of the movie, we have those long, lingering images of Bullitt's revolver in its holster, brought home by the detective right after using it to kill a man. False. In a major police department, any gun used in an officer-involved shooting is instantly impounded as evidence, until the subsequent investigation has proven him innocent of wrongdoing, and the completion of any resultant legal proceedings, as well. <br /> <br />So, the first reason to see this movie: Steve McQueen does an excellent job of portraying Frank Bullitt as a police detective so emotionally buttoned-down he's almost incapable of expressing real emotion: hate, love, rage, fear, despair, only emerge through those amazingly gray laser beam eyes. This guy is so tense he can barely sleep at night. He's an avatar of that most American of hard-boiled fictional detectives, from Dashiell Hammett's Continental Op onward: the job holder. To Bullitt, all that matters is getting the job done. Everything else, personal physical jeopardy, conflict with his lover, the grief he's buying himself with Robert Vaughn's sleazy politician, takes a backseat to solving the crime. <br /> <br />Many folks can't figure out what's happening in the movie's final image, Frank Bullitt staring at his own reflection in a mirror. I would hazard a guess it just might be Bullitt contemplating (perhaps \\"dreading\\" would be a better word) exactly how the beautiful girlfriend sleeping in the other room, who's already been giving him grief about the violence of the world he inhabits, is going to react when he tells her how he spent HIS day. <br /> <br />The other reason to see Bullitt is, of course, the car chase. There's a reason this scene is famous, folks: it's just damn good. At 1:05:17 according to my DVD player, Frank Bullitt, while getting into his dark racing green Ford Mustang 390 GT, notices he's being stalked by a black 1968 Dodge Charger 440 Magnum R/T, inside which are two hitmen he's been trying to catch for most of the movie. He pulls out, the Charger follows. For the next three minutes, they play cat and mouse with each other, driving slowly through winding, sloping San Francisco streets. Suddenly the roles reverse, Bullitt has finessed himself BEHIND the Charger. The hunters become the hunted. From the moment Bill Hickman fastens his seatbelt at 1:08:28 and the Charger peels out, until the scene ends seven minutes later at 1:15:31 we're treated to the greatest car versus car chase in motion picture history. Only the chase scene in The French Connection eclipses Bullitt - but that's a car chasing an elevated train. For car versus car, nothing can touch Bullitt. <br /> <br />Credit for the success of this scene, while obviously we must recognize the director/cinematographer/editor, must go mostly to Bill Hickman and Steve McQueen. Hickman, who also stunt drove The French Connection, has been called \\"a madman who refused to back down from a challenge.\\" He's also been called \\"the greatest stunt driver in motion picture history.\\" McQueen, himself an accomplished auto and motorcycle racer, insisted on doing his own driving in this scene. Where many movies have attempted to generate an impression of speed in chase scenes by shooting cars moving at sane velocities, then speeding up the film, everything in the Bullitt car chase is shown in real time, as Hickman and McQueen pilot their Mustang and Charger respectively through twisting San Francisco streets and out into the surrounding roads (San Francisco: a city absolutely infested with slow moving green VW Beetles) at speeds of up to 115 miles an hour. There's none of the fishtailing around corners we see in so many car chases, because directors think it looks \\"dramatic,\\" like a car almost out of control. Instead Hickman and McQueen slide smoothly through corners, their cars look they're being driven by pros - because they are. <br /> <br />After all the lame car chases we've all suffered through over the years, it's great to see it done right. There's never been another car chase to equal Bullitt, because to execute that scene required two absolutely insane, highly skilled stunt drivers: Bill Hickman and Steve McQueen. And their like doesn't come around that often.
B000002MG1|5.0|As a teenager from the 70's, I can truly say as an owner of REM's Automatic for the People CD, it's REM's best! The thought provoking lyrics are great. They target the great people from the past in the words of each song a very highly creative way! Thank you REM for this CD! A perfect 5 star rating!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|This film is certainly worth watching once, but it can be such a stomach churner that only the gnarliest gore hound might want to put this one in the must buy column.  A tightly spun story unfolds nicely through flashbacks and present tense with some solid acting in particular by Cary Elwes.  The ending for some might fall a little flat seeming a little forced, but the first 1 hr and 24 minutes is really good stuff, very twisted and original.  Thumbs up I just wonder if a little more production time might have improved the rushed tagged on twist ending that falls apart a little bit with some afterthought.  Still the best \\"new\\" horror flick I have seen in awhile.

B00005JNPZ|3.0|If you happened to be a romantically challenged person like myself, Then \\"Hitch\\"sounds like the best movie worth seeing. There are some parts of the movie where I laughed and laughed some more This was a Brilliant film  for Will Smith-who is known for bringing moviegoers out of the heat-and into the wll air-conditioned screens of indoor multi-plexes during the hot summer months. Kevin James was great in his big-screen debut, Look for him doing movies whenever His Show, \\"The King of Queens\\" goes off the air. Eva Mendez looks absolutely great She'll probably be THE sexiest woman... Alive! She is so HOT!!! One of the best parts of this film happens to be Will drop-kicked Eva into the harbor as they headed off to Ellis Island. This is indeed a good date film You won't be totally disapppointed!
B00005U2LM|4.0|The Wu is back for their 4th group album, just 13 months since thir last group album was released.  Better then \\"The W\\" but not as good as their first 2 classic albums.  No Cappadonna or Ol' Dirty Bastard (R.I.P.) are on this one however.  There is a few guests, Ron Isley, Prodigal Son & 12 O' Clock all are on one song and Street Life & Madame D are on 2 songs each.  A few members are on many songs (Rae, Ghost, Deck, and Masta are all on at least half) while other are on less than half of the songs (Meth, RZA, GZA, U-God).  It only has 12 songs, but of them there is one classic, 2 near classics, 6 good songs, 1 or 2 I skip, and 1 or 2 that's ok.

0316921173|4.0|If Joseph Heller went to see Joseph Campbell and they dropped acid with some of the Beat Poets, the documented conversation of the trip might have turned out to be something like \\"Infinite Jest.\\" <br /> <br />I have read this book six times in as many years. With each reading, I find something that I didn't see before.  <br /> <br />The dizzying, elliptical plotlines converge, finally, at the end of the book. I didn't get a handle on them until my third reading.  <br /> <br />The most riveting, most entertaining, and most savage imagery, first to last, has been my mind's eye view of the Statue of Liberty decorated with a Depends Undergarment. The concept of subsidized time just riveted me. The more I think about how we in the U.S. \\"sell the invisible\\" and relentlessly market the consumption habit, splitting hairs to disguise commodity items as unique, the funnier this gets. I fully expect to find that Wallace has achieved what many science fiction authors achieve: a reasonable forecast of the future. He's pulled this off, not in the science and technology realm, but in the much more complex sociology domain, and I am in awe of the result. <br /> <br />The unsentimental, but not unsympathetic, portrayal of alcoholics and mentally or emotionally disturbed people (rich and poor) succeeded at making me see the characters as people, not conditions.  <br /> <br />I believed I could recognize Poor Tony. I know I've known Hal Incandenza and Madame Psychosis...and so, probably, have you. Addicts to fame, narcotics, alcohol, political ideologies, and instant gratification of all kinds meet their fates, or cause others to do so, and if there's a message in the book, it may simply be this: we will all die. We can choose how to live; choices have consequences; and, ultimately, our redemption lies in 3 things: in our willingness to 1) hear each other's stories, 2) bear each other's pain, and 3) forgive each other our sins, in whatever form our personal faiths take.
B000002LCX|5.0|'Strangeways' is perhaps the most comic of all the Smiths albums - with tracks like 'Girlfriend in a coma' and 'Unhappy birthday' it shows Morrissey's supreme talent in the art of wit. It also is one of their most 'produced' albums - it has more of a studio feel to it. It is not quite 'Meat is Murder' or the 'Queen is Dead' - but it is still a minor masterpiece, in my opinion.
B00001ZULV|5.0|Shortly after I became a big fan of Phil Collins, I picked this CD up at the local music store. Since I haven't heard alot of Genesis songs, I really can't say if there were some songs that should have been included on here or not. I think the songs on here are good though. My personal favorite is NO SON OF MINE which was off their 1991 album; WE CAN'T DANCE. It has a great beat and good lyrics. The song talks about a man who ran away from home when he was a boy and is now fighting his fears to go back to confront his dad. The worst song on this CD is probably I CAN'T DANCE, which is also from the album; WE CAN'T DANCE. To me, this song sounds like a wannabe ACDC song with bad lyrics. That is the only bad song on the CD. Here is a complete list of all the songs(next to each song is the album it was from):<br /><br />01.Turn It On Again(1980 Duke) 6/5<br /><br />02.Invisible Touch(1986 Invisible Touch) 5/5<br /><br />03.Mama(1983 Genesis) 6/5<br /><br />04.Land Of Confusion(1986 Invisible Touch) 4/5<br /><br />05.I Can't Dance(1991 We Can't Dance) 1.5/5<br /><br />06.Follow You, Follow Me(1978 And Then There Were Three)6/5<br /><br />07.Hold On My Heart(1991 We Can't Dance) 6/5<br /><br />08.Abacab(1981 Abacab) 6/5<br /><br />09.I Know What I Like(1973 Selling England By The Pound) 5/5<br /><br />10.No Son Of Mine(1991 We Can't Dance) 8/5<br /><br />11.Tonight, Tonight, Tonight(1986 Invisible Touch) 8/5<br /><br />12.In Too Deep(1986 Invisible Touch) 6/5<br /><br />13.Congo(1997 Calling All Stations) 3.5/5<br /><br />14.Jesus He Knows Me(1991 We Can't Dance) 6/5<br /><br />15.That's All(1983 Genesis) 4.5/5<br /><br />16.Misunstanding(1980 Duke) 6/5<br /><br />17.Throwing It All Away(1986 Invisible Touch) 5/5<br /><br />18.The Carpet Crawlers(1999 Turn It On Again[Remix]) 5/5
B00005JM02|5.0|Brilliance once again.  Simply stated.  Weather searching for a quality movie to watch with your little ones, or you are looking for a good movie to make you and your sweetie laugh, this is the movie for you.  The subtle (and some not so subtle) adult humor will put you through fits of gut wrenching laughter.  Pixar has worked wonders with their amazing animation...the colors and detail will awe you.  A must have for your DVD collection.
B000024L5R|5.0|Celine is the finest singer of popular music in the world now.  If that's not good enough, then what is?  Her singing is flawless not because she hits the right notes everytime like an oepra singer (which she usually does), but because she sings from her heart - and that touches your heart.  She brings each song to a higher level.  Try singing the song yourself.  Hear the difference.  For those who can't appreciate her singing, I would suggest going for a formal hearing test (audiometry)by a doctor or audiologist before putting your comments down in print.  This is her first big English album - which focussed attention on her 2 prior English albums - and its success in commercial sales just speaks for itself.  150 million sales later, this is truly one lady whose songs are truly well worth spending your hard-earned money on.
B00000DCHD|5.0|Lemme say \\"The Stranger\\" and \\"52nd Street\\" are among my top favorites I can add from Billy Joel who I'm a big fan to. He actually has a unique style w/ a good tone too.  <br /> <br />This album kinda reminds me when I was listening to some jazz while growing up. First of all, it's not that I started it big when I was 13 or 14. <br /> <br />Can't say much about it but it's still good and real diverse. My main man Freddie Hubbard (who I'm a huge fan to) is taking it easy on his solo on \\"Zanzibar\\" with a jazz feel at the end before blending into rock w/ special Mike Mainieri on vibes and marimba. <br /> <br />Love every minute of it. This would take me back into the man's work of today since Elton John which I like who can his songs good w/o going off balance. My favorite songs are Zanzibar, Big Shot, Honesty, My Life, Stilletto, Half a Mile Way and 52nd Street. <br /> <br />So those are my top picks. Well enjoy the masterpiece from the legendary Billy Joel and most definitely check out \\"The Stranger\\" which is hot feat. \\"Just The Way You Are\\" which is one of my favorites and most definitely I would like to sing one day among others. A must-have.
B00025ETIW|3.0|Well I really LOVED the video for I'm Not Okay (not to mention the song) but unfortunately I found this was definitely an album where the band makes 1 really good single and the rest of the album seems to go in a totally different direction.  This suprised me as this is usually something done by pop artists.  Now as for the rest of the songs I have mixed feelings.  Many of them seem to similar and I find the lyrics try way too hard.  Call me crazy but I don't think the lead singer gets into gunfights at a saloon in the wild wild west.  If you are a big fan of punk/rock thenn I would purchase this, however if you have some qualms about buying this album I would reccommend listening to some of the other tracks before making ur decision.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Phil Collins for about 2 years now and I got this CD shortly after. This CD has alot of great PC songs, don't get me wrong, but there are also a lot of songs that should have been on here as well such as: I Missed Again, This Must Be Love, Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away, Do You Remember?, Everyday, and Can't Turn Back The Years. On the bright side, this CD has 16 other remarkable songs, here is a complete list of all the hits:<br /><br />01.Another Day In Paradise 5/5<br /><br />02.True Colours 5/5<br /><br />03.Easy Lover 6/5<br /><br />04.You Can't Hurry Love 5/5<br /><br />05.Two Hearts 5/5<br /><br />06.I Wish It Would Rain Down 4.5/5<br /><br />07.Against All Odds 5/5<br /><br />08.Something Happened On The Way To Heaven 4.5/5<br /><br />09.Seperate Lives 5/5<br /><br />10.Both Sides Of The Story 6/5<br /><br />11.One More Night 6/5<br /><br />12.Sussudio 6/5<br /><br />13.Dance In To The Light 5/5<br /><br />14.A Groovy Kind Of Love 5/5<br /><br />15.In The Air Tonight 7/5<br /><br />16.Take Me Home 6/5

It's certainly one of the better books about building wealth and I think that everyone can benefit from it regardless of their current level of income.<br /><br />For $20 it's hard to ask for much more than the dozens of nuggets of wisdom you get and can use in real life. My rule of thumb is that if you get one idea from a book it's worth five stars and a thousand dollars.

B0000WN0VY|5.0|This is simply the most intriquing CD to me in at least 5 years.  I heard some of the tracks recently 1) a TV movie called Amnesia, 2) the UK Big Brother finale and 3) last night at the end of that great show LOST.  This music always leaves me wanting more and I cannot wait until he does another one.  I am addicted to every song and love the fact that each track is so different from the one before. This is a beautiful CD.
B000002GAF|5.0|I'd been a fan to Gino since I heard his singles \\"I Just Wanna Stop\\" and \\"Living Inside Myself\\" instantly. I actually love how he sounds. He just combined jazz-rock into pop music or he just combined jazz, rock, pop, a lil R&B into his music. Enuff said. <br /> <br />Ok back to the album I luv every song on this albums but my favorites are: I Just Wanna Stop, River Must Flow, Feel Like Dying, Brother to Brother, Wings of Life, The Evil Eye, and  People I Belong To. <br /> <br />Those are songs I play back to back and sing along with. God bless Gino for a wonderful classic. This by far is my favorite album of all-time and Gino is still my top influence of rock history and music culture. Along w/ Steely Dan, Phil Collins, Billy Joel, Elton John, etc. are among my biggest influences in rock 'n roll.
0385510454|3.0|Grisham usually writes from his personal history.  This time, he branched out into areas where he has no direct knowledge.  It shows.  While it is a decent read, it doesn't have the passion of his previous books about the legal field or about the deep south.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I actually shunned purchasing U2's \\"Pop\\" for several years because I felt that they had betrayed their original sound. This was merely a band following the regular course of evolution set upon with \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"Zooropa\\" and culminating with the 1997 release of \\"Pop.\\" They had gone from earnest to cynical, but the veneer of pop culture satire also revealed a band bloated with it's own excess, as the huge props from the PopMart tour demonstrated.<br /><br />Looking back, these three releases from the 1990s fit together, and \\"Pop\\" rocks harder than \\"Zoo\\" but without the gritty appeal of \\"Achtung.\\"<br /><br />The disk kicks off with \\"Discotheque\\" and it's distinctive guitar riffs. Who would have thought of U2 as playing disco songs! Oh, it's supposed to be a joke...isn't it?<br /><br />The number two spot, \\"Do You Feel Loved,\\" is a better song with a cool drum groove and simple melody and some fuzzy guitar.<br /><br />The key to most of U2's better disks lies with tracks 1-5. Track 3, \\"Mofo\\" dissolves into standard techno repetition. Then the band completely shifts gears for the lovely spiritual ballad \\"If God Will Send His Angels,\\" focusing on Bono's vocal. This was perhaps misplaced on the disk? Track 5 is the strong and very vintage-U2 \\"Staring at the Sun\\" which stands the test of time.<br /><br />Track 6 rebounds with \\"Last Night on Earth\\" which is one of the strongest songs on the disk. Great scratchy guitar, good drumming by Larry Mullen Jr. and excellent vocals by Bono. \\"Gone\\" has some big-beat majesty, \\"Miami\\" is a snapshot of art deco-land and \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" is a rip on LA.<br /><br />\\"Please\\" is a slow-burn heart-break song with some spiritual undertones. \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" is the traditional end of disk piece with the strongest religious tone, from the point of view of a person trying to make sense in our messed up world and praying for some guidance.
0385510454|1.0|Not as bad as A Painted House but pretty close.  The only thrilling part of the book was I was thrilled to be finished with it.  Don't waste your money.  Last Grisham for me...he lost it along time ago.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Me & Mr Johnson by Eric Clapton is rocking good! <br /> <br />Not his best effort, but awesome nonetheless.
B0000WN0VY|4.0|I loved the song \\"The Blower's Daughter from the movie \\"Closer\\" and decided to check out the artist.  I have to say that the snippets of the various songs on Amazon.com don't do the songs justice.  I debated buying the regular CD or the limited edition with the DVD of Damien Rice performing.  I decided to go 'whole hog', and if I didn't like it I'd put it up for sale.  I have to say I was really surprised at the songs.  Interesting lyrics, and Damien has an interesting vocal style.  While I'm a rocker in my heart, I've made room for Damien!
B0006399FS|1.0|Why do these groups pop up? When will they quit premoting the cycle of greed and fascism? All the lies and all the CDs soild, tennage girls haven't figured it out. They were used. Theywere these guys fast ticket to the easy life. They didn't get there by hard work, or because they deserved it, or because they were talented, they made it by greedy corprate record labels who picked the \\"cutest\\" guys they could, slap em all together and repeatthe process, hence we have talentless hacks such as Nsync, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, U2 New Kids on the Block, and the like selling this garbage to a target age group in order to make the money. What happened to sincere artists like Genesis and Gary Barlow? Teens are a huge market, the record companies know that, and instead of getting truly gifted and talented artists out in the public eye, they manufacture a group of puppets, and promise them money, sex, and women, and that;s what they got, and meantime more and more profits from cd sales are going to these fat pigs who seem top have everyone fooled. Ladies you are doing a diservice to yourself by supporting this garbage.  <br /> <br />thank god this craze is over. They vaulted to the top of the charts a few years ago, thanks to the dedicated teenie fans, but alas, no longer are they so respected, except by people who Never Got Over It. Yet they still linger beneath the surface, waiting to rise again. We have four who never used this horrid band as a catalyst to start something else, and then you have this middle aged clown invading the media worse than anthrax. <br />First I would like to say that four guys that don't play instruments, dance around the stage, and don't sing good lyics (in my opinion they didn't sing anything at all) is not a band. Thety are barly a music group. Them, like many other groups of the late 90's (the begining of the dark age of music that we are in now as i like to call it) only got popular becasue MTV said you should listen to it. The best boy band that ever came along had to have been Take That. Not one of their songs was ever as bad as \\"Crumbs from Your Table.\\" they sing with little or no emotion, their voices are annoying and whiny and there is no attempt at creating variety. This cd sounds almost identical to every other cd put out by a boyband in the last ten years. Screw this manufactured pop sludge, it's even worse than turgid boring hip hop and irritating RnB.  <br /> <br />Why do people try to make a bunch of \\"hot celebs\\" singers? First of all, their \\"dancing\\" gives me the willies. You know  <br />that \\"Vertigo\\" song where they try to miserably immitate Cypress Hill? It is so cheesy. The front of there Cd lookes the like the guy on the far right is trying to show off his new deoderant to the guy next to him, (I don't know what their names are, thank god) and they look they are marionetts. I like punk rock, pop rock, and metel, so obviuslly this would want to chuck their stupid cd into the toilet.  can't believe my generation is so ga-ga over such sugary bubblegum crap!! There's no originality,no creativity-nothing!! It seems like leftovers from New Kids and not very good ones at that!! I hope and pray they break up soon and go away!! Leave music,writing and singing to those who know how to do it!!  <br />I cant even put into words how much I despise these trendy commercial bands like U2.They are a perfect example of the sorry state that music is in today.There are no good songs on the entire album and I wouldnt give this to my worst enemy.This is as commercial as commercial gets.Only naive little girls and people with poor taste in music would listen to this garbage.I pray to god that these cheesy pop bands and britney spears of the music industry will fade away soon.DO  <br /> <br />i like u2's \\"Pop\\" album better. No matter how much I try to listen to this album, it doesn't work out for me. Most of the songs are totally written like garbage. It's true that \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" can not compare with \\"Discotheque\\". *Bono might as well be going solo. It's just Bono and Larry Mullen show. With their new album  coming out, they still look like teens and \\"Vertigo\\" sounds pretty cheesy for the promising hit single for the album. To the fans of U2: it is the gARY bARLOW who broke away from the teen industry. gB looks more different, his songs sound more like adult contemporary nowadays. U2 has to mature in order to stay within the charts otherwise expect a vh-1 show, \\"where are they now?\\" <br />fINALLY <br />all i can say bout this cd and group is they stink. i hate their music. disgrace to all talent. and what's up with them on the rap stations? huh?! i don't get it. someone let me know what's going on in peoples heads these days. speaking of people's heads....what's up with bono's hair.....girls he's UGLY! go for someone with more style and a better voice. he sounds like he's whining all the time.  voice sounds way too nasal and it cracks whenever he tries to sing high notes tell me...is that attractive or do you all do that too? yea....whatever....this cd is the worst... <br /> appreciate how hard the group must work to become the teen idols of so many little 12-year-olds in america, and they do it with such an elegant and graceful facade. the main problem with this album, and their group in general, is LACK OF SINCERITY. and maybe a little more creativity could be helpful, too. What they really need to work on is how their CD sets them apart from other artists- not how they can conform to the icconoclastic ways of the teen pop world. I'd like to hit one of these guys in the face with a red-hot frying pan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0385510438|1.0|This was nothing like any of Grisham's past novels....the title alone is nothing like you'd expect.  First, there was no 'last' juror...only 3 died in the book.  And there was no single juror that held any precidence over the others at all that had any major plot line of the story.  I feel that two thirds of the novel is completely irrelevant.  I'm sure that it would be interesting to anyone wanting to know about the history of Clanton during the 70's; to them it would have been astounding....but no, it was a historical bore!   <br /> <br />I wanted a courtroom thriller, but really, any drama in the courtroom happened completely randomly in the last 10 pages....I kept reading only because I wanted the monotonous story line to end. <br /> <br />If you are looking forward to one another one of Grisham's better thriller, wait till his next book....this one is a bore from page 5 through 455.  Sleep Tight!!
0064471837|5.0|Seriously. I do not know of any other fantasy series that can beat this. The storyline is supurb, and everything is described so wonderfully. There isn't much else I want to say, besides that if you are looking for the best fantasy/adventure book out there, you found it. Buy Sabriel, and the other two books, Lirael, and Abhorsen.<br /><br />I loved it, and you will too.
B00000JGHM|5.0|I NEVER give movies five stars but this one is just too good from start to finish. 2 1/2 hours of pure, raw, wonderful storytelling, with real power.<br /><br />I can't wait to get the double DVD in 02/05!
B000006TRV|5.0|Those reviews below me are written from kids that have no idea what music is. If you don't like old music, why don't you stop things people did in the past, like breathing, and eating? Well anyway, this album is great and still is the second best selling ever. The music has an excellent sound the variation of the different types song styles. Waters leads mostly every song, and he does justice to them. Do yourself a favor and pick this up.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I'm going to see it tomorrow for the 8th and last time as it is leaving the theater in my area.  After seeing the Phantom, I immediately bought the sound track.  I agree with the reviewer who said that Gerard Butler's voice is more sensual and manly and really fits the part of the phantom.  His voice shows an entire array of emotions.  Michael Crawford has a very refined voice, but I too think it is too high.   I fell in love with this movie.  I get lost in the music..and I always cry at the end..it's so tragic.  Emmy Rossum is wonderful, and Patrick Wilson is a perfect Raoul.  I love the costumes , scenery,  the sets,.....Everything was perfect.
0060528737|5.0|This is my favorite of the three books(Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen). This fantasy isn't worth it if you haven't read the other two books, so make sure you do that first. If you have, you are about to go on an amazing adventure, getting more deep with the character's personalities, and breathing the air of the Old Kingdom. You will feel as if you were there. This book just makes you keep on turning the page, and is the best fantasy/adventure book I've read. To get the best of the series, you should be no younger that about 10.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK
B0000BYM3K|3.0|The first time I played this CD, I was thoroughly disgusted with how poor it was.  I literally winced when I heard Bruce's vocals on \\"No More Lies.\\"  However, after giving it some more time, I became somewhat more fond of the album.  It's still among the band's worst efforts, but it does have some shining moments.<br /><br />While they wanted to (and succeeded in) recapturing their old sound with \\"Brave New World,\\" this CD takes a somewhat different direction ... that of more radio-friendly, modern rock.  Just listen to the opener, \\"Wildest Dreams\\"  ... its entire composition, from the music to the banal lyrics, screams radio hit.  This isn't necessarily bad, as some of the best songs on here have very melodious guitar work and catchy choruses, such as \\"Age of Innocence\\" and \\"New Frontier.\\"  There's also the acoustic closer, \\"Journeyman,\\" which owes something to Kansas' \\"Dust in the Wind.\\"  Just listen to the opening riff.<br /><br />Sadly, though, most of the album fails to meet this grade of quality.  \\"No More Lies\\" is drawn out and irritating, \\"Montsegur\\" is a good attempt at a classic Maiden epic, but doesn't really do anything for me, and the title track is simply god awful.  Its lyrics are laughable, and at around 5 or 6 minutes in, Bruce does this rapid fire vocal delivery that may be the worst thing he's ever sung.  But the fatal flaw of much of the material here, as with \\"Face in the Sand,\\" is its blandness.<br /><br />On this release, the band seems to be at odds with itself.  At times it is content to loosen up and play some heavy rock, but Bruce's vocals are simply not suitable for such a style, and the piercing guitar solos undermine the overall feeling.  At other times, they seem to want to stay true to their metal roots, but cannot fully commit to them.  This indecisiveness may account for the album's unevenness.<br /><br />If the abominable cover art doesn't deter you from this one, then be warned that, as another reviewer mentioned, the production on this recording is severely lacking, resulting in a muddled sound.  There are a handful of good songs here, mostly appearing on the second half of the album, but this album is only for Maiden devotees.  Neophytes should stick to the classics, or \\"Brave New World.\\"n this recording is severely lacking, resulting in a muddled sound.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble is HOT. Capital H. O. T.  <br />with a voice that is H. O. T. T. E. S. T. on this planet. <br /> <br />I have to admire Michael Buble's musical honesty. He takes no prisoners, just sings his heart out and leaves you feeling like you've received a private concert. I was asked to describe his style and the first word that came to my mind was SEXy it's like you're caressed by him. Feeling good is a great start to this great cd. This Simon song lights it up from the first notes and right from the beginning it's one superb song after another.
B00008976Y|5.0|In recent cinematic memory, there are few films that study the subject of grief well or uniquely, though some, like \\"In the Bedroom,\\" succeed on many levels.  However, Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski is obviously a master at his craft and in his \\"Blue,\\" he not only takes a look at grief, but also its internalization and the liberation of death, sides not often studied.  In the opening sequence of the film, Julie Vignon de Courcy (Juliette Binoche) is with her famed composer husband and daughter in a car that crashes into a tree, killing all but Julie.  She must learn to achieve catharsis post-accident, and Kieslowski observes her means of closure, utilizing various motifs (ie the blue pool) to emphasize how she superficially disregards pain yet wallows in it every day, whether she admits it or not.  In an amazing scene, Julie finds a blue sucker that seems to remind her of either her husband or daughter, and she cannot scream, so she bites onto the sucker and chomps it, a sound that becomes more visceral than a scream, as it occurs within, her eyes focused on crunching and biting and nashing.  Kieslowski effectively makes these subtle moments as profound as possible, presenting how liberty and closure can be achieved despite pain and further detailing the healing process along the way.  Binoche contributes well with one of the greatest performances in cinematic history.  She depicts Julie with nuance and strength, obviously willing to do whatever it took to make her character believably shaken yet willing to move on.  Near the end of the film, when Julie meets her husband's mistress, she speaks with her and eventually gives her the house in which she formerly lived.  Her husband's mistress says that she expected such generosity, that the husband spoke of Julie in such a positive way that her kindess is not surprising.  By the end of the film, we are not surprised either.  Binoche makes us believe.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is quite simply the greates Rock album ever made. I bought this album without hearing a single track off it. Silly, as this may sound, I based my purchase on hearing Sober from the Undertow album. After heading home, and firing it in the CD player, I was assaulted by the heavy bass line and haunting vocals. Quite simply, this album touches so many nerves and illicits so many thoughts and feelings that it is almost a Modern Poe to Heavy Metal. This may sounds a bit over the top, but for me, the lyrics themselves, combined with Maynards heart-felt delivery cut me to the bone and leave me wanting more. I would rate this as the best album ever made, and if you don't agree with me, so be it. <br />
B00007KQA3|5.0|Or even better still, also read the book by George Orwell, an inspiring piece of worldly paranoia, that is truth, quoted well into the twenty first century as the future, and it is, not because mankind doesn't think it will ever go this way, but because we know full well we are, but somehow are allowing it to happen everyday. It is decentralization of power from the human being, in all aspects of one's life, to a higher power, a bigger cause, communism called the great Lucifer because all was given to the collective body and not to God, now God is the great Lucifer because we give ourselves to the collective body of something that we can not prove, so Science is the great Lucifer, producing weapons to kill the world a million times over, toxins to poison us a million times over, are all forms of giving to a collective body the nature of death? Is it the giving to a collective body that robs the soul of its power? Is it giving oneself wholly and utterly to something other than one's own self the conduit of decent into the investment of despair. 1984 sees men and women working their themselves to skin and bone to achieve a greater good that never emerges, the ultimate failings masked by a strict authoritative regime, BIG BROTHER, the power all seeing and ever controlling, rewriting history, editing the world around them, at war with this nation one minute and switching to another the next, neighbours up and vanish and protagonists invest in each other for but a fleeting glimpse of love only to be captured by the THOUGHT POLICE for engaging in illegal activity, men at the top of this society using torture and mind control to enforce a pathology of unquestionable and undeniable supremacy of all the power to the BIG BROTHER system, and that this is the system and that is why they are alive at all, at which point we question if it is worth living at all to which Orwell delivers a resounding, no, of course it is not worth living this life, why bother at all, and that this is a piece of work that must be understood by everyone and anyone who can read and is certainly mandatory reading for anyone in least bit interested in politics or political science.<br /><br />Unfortunately however we tend to vote in military commanders, lawyers and extreme capitalists into government and then ask why it is all going down hill.<br /><br />The problem is there is no terminology in the English language to describe the act of one human being killing their unborn future children by process of setting up a bad management system with a legal body incorporated into that system before they die.

068987474X|5.0|I wish this book was around when I was 13 years old.  It would have saved me a lot of time playing guessing games and a lot of hurt. If I had this manual to dating while growing up I would've made far better decisions than I made.  Alas, that is the past, but the future looks bright. <br /> <br />I purchased this book right after I left my boyfriend of one and a half years.  A friend suggested it and I was grasping for anything to make me feel better.  To tell you the truth, it actually made me feel worse.  It was too brutally honest--I was expecting a happy sugar coated \\"you go girl\\" type of book.  Instead it threw the bitter truth into my face, which stung.  However, I swallowed the advice it gave and I must say it has been the best thing that has happened to me in the dating world. <br /> <br />To be fair, the bitter truth in this book is delivered in a highly entertaining manner that makes it a fun read.  However, the underlying advice and principles behind the anecdotes and lists of do's and don'ts are honest and to be taken to heart. <br /> <br />I have followed the advice of this book and have found myself in a wonderful relationship with a wonderful man.  It took many first dates with many different men to find my dream man, however this book gave me the hope and courage to say goodbye to less than fulfilling dating partners. <br /> <br />Go, no run out and buy this book!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This is 1 of the worst movies I have ever tried to stomach. This is a good example of why people should not do drugs. There are no acting skills. There are no directing skills. Let me just save some time, THERE ARE NO SKILLS AT ALL IN VOLVED IN THIS MOVIE. Honestly, if someone offered me $100.00 to watch this movie, I would turn it down. Completely awfull!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0006399FS|2.0|Two stars because the name of the band. The rest is very poor...
B000002TQV|4.0|The Bends is one of those albums that is underappreciated, despite being much better than anything else the band has produced, with the possible exception of Ok Computer.  Radiohead has always been a little weird and artsy, but at least the music on their earlier albums is accessable to listeners.  Their later albums, especially Kid A and Amnesiac, are just too weird.  For the must part, they're more noise than music.  Anyone who thinks differently is either trying way too hard to be unique, or is just clueless about music.  The music heard on The Bends displays originality but not the unlistenable weirdness that that band evolved into playing.  Yes, I like Radiohead, even a few of the weird songs, but admit it fellas, those albums aren't half as good as you'd like them to be.  But since it's cool, in a noncomformist way, to like them, you pretend to like them.  The truth is that The Bends and Ok Computer are fifty times better than anything Radiohead has made or will make, assuming they stick with their artsy crap.  It's sad to think how great Radiohead could have been if they would have just not sold out to the artsy, Yoko Ono crowd.  Stop trying so hard.  Just write and play music.  Quit the experiementation crap.  No one likes it.  You could have been great without the detour, and now, you've alienated most of your potential fans.  Trust me folks.  I am your master.

0671027344|4.0|I just finished reading \\"The Perks of Being A Wallflower\\" and I have fallen in love with this book.  I heard several of my friends talking about the book and how good it was, so I had to find out for myself.   <br />The story is written in letter format by a high school freshman, Charlie.  Charlie tells about his experiences growing up, including his first party with beer.  I felt that this book touched base with a lot of the experiences I had growing up in high school.  I could really understand what Charlie was thinking. Once you start this book, you become absorbed by it.  You hurt when Charlie hurts; you smile when Charlie is happy.   <br />Chbosky really has the talent to draw in readers.  I am looking forward to reading more by Chbosky in the future.
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|ok, this review wont be very helpful probably, but its worth a shot. i saw this movie at home for the first time about a week ago, maybe two, and i absolutely LOVED it! it is very heartwarming, and parts are sad, it is a total love story and you might even cry when you see it its so sad and amazing...i loved this movie and definatly recommend it for anyone, especially females, because it is definatly a moving worth seeing, if not owning!
B0000028UK|4.0|When I first heard this album, I hated it and was very disappointed, because I was expecting another \\"Ten\\". But having loved their debut so much, I kept giving this one a try over and over untill it finally grew on me. It took a while, but once I had accepted the fact that Pearl Jam decided to go with a completely different formula than on \\"Ten\\", and would probably never repeat \\"Ten\\", I really began to love this album for what it is: A fantastic, straight ahead rocker. It is easily Pearl Jam's most aggressive and rawest sounding album. You really can't just \\"listen\\" to \\"VS\\" and not have it affect you in some way. After finally getting it for the first time, I realized just how special it really was. It got to the point that I liked it almost as much as \\"Ten\\". If you're looking for polished hit after hit, you listen to \\"Ten\\". But if you're looking for a more raw, live sound(which is what they are best at), you listen to \\"VS\\". I remember back in the summer of '94, while anxiously waiting for \\"Vitalogy\\" to come out, I listened to \\"VS\\" 24-7 and have since come to love it.I really got into the \\"feel\\" they were shooting for here, and I think most rock fans do too, once they give it a chance. Some real fast and hard tracks, a few really good mellow tracks, a couple quirkey sounding tracks but still good in their own right. Also contains a fan-favorite and classic, \\"Rearviewmirror\\". Over all, a real good album once you give it a chance. Their most rawest and hardest album. Since all their albums besides \\"Ten\\" follow this rawer and harder sound, I highly recommend starting here. Then work your way up the list chronologically (\\"Vitalogy\\" being their weakest, but still good in it's own right). After all that, try \\"Ten\\" and hear them as they first started out. Light-years of difference, but hey, that's what makes Pearl Jam so interesting. That's what seperates them from everybody else. They make music the way THEY want it, not how the public may want it. They are truly their OWN band in every sense, and their second potent effort completely demonstrates that. \\"VS\\" is classic PJ and considered by many to be their best. And with such epic tracks as \\"Daughter\\", \\"Dissident\\", \\"Elderly Woman\\", and \\"Indifference\\", it's easy to see why.
1592400876|1.0|I find it strange that _The New Yorker_ has been slighted for listing the many errors in Truss's book.  One review mentions that _The New Yorker_ \\"delighted in pointing out the errors.\\"  Another said \\"at least they're honest errors.\\"  The trouble with this sentimental defense is that punctuation errors in any book constitute a subject for correction; punctuation errors in a punctuation book give us a reason to pull that book from the shelves.  Why would anyone want to pay for something laced with the errors it purports to correct?  Truss uses mixed methods of punctuation for the same category of entry, incorrectly omits or applies commas to nonrestrictive clauses, uses parentheses to set off independent clauses, and will likely corrupt its readers' purer use of the colon and semi-colon. <br /> <br />In addition to its blatant errors, the book champions certain choices of style without providing reasons for its position.  The choices are highly questionable.  The semi-colon should not be promoted.  It's an end-stop form of punctuation and often unnecessary.  I used one above to link sequential clauses directly related to the same subject.  In a list of one or more elements containing a comma, the semi-colon is used to separate those elements, and the list is preceded by a colon according to a standard hierarchy of punctuation.  Truss misuses the colon several times, including in this statement: \\"Punctuation is a means, and its end is: helping the reader to hear, to follow.\\"  Beyond this error is the less obvious but equally dangerous approach to grammar that favors intrusive punctuation.  The word should suffice.  The period and comma are usually sufficient. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, some American readers likely have the impression that a British \\"stickler\\" for grammar must surely know more than we barbarian minimalists.  Perhaps one benefit of _Eating, Shoots & Leaves_ is that is debunks this notion.  Otherwise, what we have is the development of a cult of littleknowledge.  I'd like to see Truss's book set the precedent for an equally clever and salable approach to punctuation that's also properly punctuated.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Ok first off. I saw the trailer for this and immediately had to get it on dvd. I was not disappointed. this movie makes Se7en  <br />(Seven) look less twisted. it's like this movie takes what Seven has. and twists it even sicker and stranger. it got the hair on my arms to stand up. It got my heart to beat faster. that is a sign this movie is a chiller horror classic. I could watch this over and over and over and never go \\"seen it enough\\" <br />it's like the plot just freaks you out so much you get hooked in. Not only a chilling story but the characters at first made you wonder if they were involved with the killer named Saw. just the picture on the cover was enough to give chills. the movie is awesome and I would recommend Seven if you haven't seen it and the Bone Collector. brilliant script. brilliant scenery. haunting shocking disgusting images. A horror movie that stuns, shocks, captivates, and lures you to see its end. I love this movie
B00001OH7P|4.0|One of my favourite albums, 'Ziggy Stardust' is indeed more than a novelty. Intangibly linked with a fiction created by Bowie, its songs resonate with glam, style and overall a sense of enjoyment. 'Starman' is an unforgettable soaring ballad, 'Star' has an unforgettable melody while Suffragette City is also great. Not so great were Five Years, Lady Stardust and Rock and Roll Suicide. Overall, an album EVERYONE with even a faint interest in music should have in their collection.

B0000A02TZ|5.0|I watched this 2 times on tv .and laughed so hard <br />Belushi and the rest of the cast are histerical <br />then my aunt and I rented it on vhs. she didn't laugh as much as I did <br />I have this on dvd and love it more and more every time I see the whole cast on screen <br />who can forget timeless scenes where Belushi sees a guy playing a guitar. snaps and busts the heck out of it <br />it's funny there because you wouldn't expect someone to do that <br />the movie is not always predictable because not everyone always acts the same on a situation. it's true. see this movie if you're a Belushi fan. it's gross, wicked, funny, touching and just a smart comedy that goes to show you what college life is hopefully not like now a days. hehe :)

B0000C7GG2|4.0|Apparently the third time was the charm -- little-known Brit-rock band Muse's third album was the one to break out in the US. \\"Absolution\\" is definitely a dark little gem -- the songs focus on deterioration and lost love, set against classical-sounding rock.<br /><br />\\"And pull us through/And this is the end/This is the end of the world.\\" An ominous piano crashes into \\"Apocalypse,\\" which is only one of several songs with a deathly edge, such as the epic \\"Time is Running Out\\" or the soaring \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" (\\"Fights and battles have begun/Revenge will surely come/Your hard times are ahead...\\"). Even the most intimate song is the thoughts of a dying atheist, afraid of what is -- and isn't -- after death.<br /><br />But Muse is also focusing on love. Dead loves, lost loves, and the idea of loves that can't or won't last out. The delicate, bittersweet \\"Sing for Absolution\\" is perhaps the purest example of this -- a love song for a woman who is apparently dead. Other songs focus on the mix of love and hate, and the feeling of love crumbling away.<br /><br />That focus of death and love -- or both together -- is what makes \\"Absolution\\" so compelling. Muse is often written off as a Radiohead clone, but their sound is more complex, and their focus is darker. A riff here and there echoes of Radiohead, and Matt Bellamy's voice echoes that of Thom Yorke. But that's about all.<br /><br />There's nothing spacey or eerie about Muse's brand of rock. Instead, they opt for a soaring, rich sound, with orchestral melodies. It's obvious that Bellamy has studied not just rock, but classical as well -- he integrates the epic quality of classical music into a melody written for guitar, bass, piano and drums. At times the sound is so massive -- not loud, but massive -- that it sounds like the speakers are going to explode.<br /><br />With music like that, one would think that Bellamy's voice would get lost in the mix. Surprisingly he doesn't -- he's no Jose Carreras, but his voice has gained new maturity, able to be a standard rock voice one moment, and then a pure choral vocalist the next. He brings across the heartbreak and anguish in the songs with startling purity, as if he means every word.<br /><br />In fact, those songs are the one weak spot -- they aren't as big or as rich as the music, which makes them sound a bit tepid. They're not bad. But they simply don't measure up to the musical genius. So ignore the words, and just listen to Bellamy and the music.<br /><br />The orchestral wall-of-sound has been Muse's trademark, and they are in fine form in their third album. Beautiful, rich and heartbreaking, this is one to keep.e Carreras, but his voice has gained new maturity, able to be a standard rock voice one moment, and then a pure choral vocalist the next.

0756910749|4.0|Garth Nix changed the face of dark fantasy (usually just horror with a prettier cover) with his instant hit \\"Sabriel.\\" It provided fans with a unique type of magic, a well-crafted alternate world, and talking animals that were anything but cute. Without missing a step, \\"Lirael\\" follows in \\"Sabriel\\"'s footsteps, with the same dark blend of humor and horror.<br /><br />Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but she won't be a full Clayr until she gains the Sight. On her fourteenth birthday, she is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight. After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library, and inadvertantly sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature: a Stilken that will call other Free Magic creatures and destroy the Clayr. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic) and soon ends up finding out more about her past -- and her future.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's son Sameth is pursued by the Dead, and is almost killed in the process; the only thing he gets for his trouble is a threat from a mysterious necromancer. Sam is supposed to be the future Abhorsen, but the problem is that he's petrified by the things his mother handles easily. And he's helped loose Free Magic on a world increasingly torn by a mysterious masked necromancer...<br /><br />Nix takes the rich world he created in \\"Sabriel\\" and makes it even richer. It's a bit like a melding of typical high fantasy with an early twentieth-century setting (phones, buses, cricket matches, electricity, guns). Old faves like Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget appear here (although Mogget's appearance is a bit brief), along with new and equally likable characters.<br /><br />Some readers may not like Lirael as well as they liked the more self-assured, kick-butt Sabriel, but Sabriel knew who she was, where she was coming from, and knew what she needed to know. Lirael is only learning those things, which makes her a more vulnerable, confused heroine. She becomes stronger and more self-assured as she learns more about Charter magery and her background.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" has the same balance of humor and horror as the first book. We have things like the bodies of refugees being turned into decayed Dead Hands, the clawed insecto-human Stilken, or just the aura of darkness around the Book of the Dead. But we also have funny things like Nick or the running joke about the Dog and food.<br /><br />The Disreputable Dog is a lot like Mogget, in that she's more than she seems and a handy source of info, but not as quietly menacing as Mogget was. And Sam is endearingly unsure of himself, and is one of the few fantasy characters to be genuinely terrified of his \\"duties,\\" not just apprehensive. His sister was the one character who fell flat; she seemed a little too \\"bossy princess.\\"<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr\\" is that it ends on a \\"to be continued\\" note. So be sure to have the concluding novel, \\"Abhorsen,\\" ready while you read this book. Dark, funny, creepy, and immensely well-written.a more vulnerable, confused heroine.

B00005JLEX|5.0|It would be worth buying these for the extras alone. What's amazing here, to me, are the interviews, so you learn how the characters were created and why they evolved the way they did--the little details, for instance, why Kramer's pants are high-waters. It's like a form & theory workshop on sit-com screenwriting and stage production. You learn how nearly every episode came into being. Nothing has been more fun to watch and more inspiring. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed. And if you're looking to read anything, I have to suggest Jennifer Paddock's A SECRET WORD (especially this one to Seinfeld fans, who love clever stories about nothing--or, actually, everyday life put in perspective).

Basically the ultimate drug movie from beginning to end during a time in American history when drugs were hugely popular.   Unforgettable scenes of note: <br /> <br />1. Tobey Maguire's character (young kid who looks like and old man) sweating incredibly in the back seat of the convertable as Gonzo and Duke are tripping on acid and practically holding a gun to his head. <br /> <br />2. Gonzo puking out of the car and onto the car next to them and screaming at the old couple next to them while Duke is driving and holding a  gun in the air, within a few seconds the old man next to them leans over across his wife and screams I'll kill you!  I'll kill you! as he is banging his fist on the window. <br /> <br />3. The ether binge at the Circus, Circus where they can barely walk through the turnstiles. <br /> <br />and much much more craziness

B00014TJ7K|5.0|CLOUD NINE<br /><br />I walked through 1987 with a great sense of satisfaction around me. The Dark Horse that no one betted on, won the race. He was the first out of the gate (`My Sweet Lord' being the first No.1 hit by a solo Beatle), and he was also the one that finished first in the race (`Got My Mind Set On You' is the last solo Beatle song to reach No.1). Along the way, others overtook him, media jockeys tried to run him off the course, former producers and band-mates derided his work and importance, but he still finished, and won. And this kind of circular event plays throughout Harrison's entire career. The first song to be recorded by The Beatles was Harrison and McCartney's `In Spite of All The Danger'. In this case, no one is willing to say truly how much was Harrison, and how much was McCartney. But these were the days of The Beatles when Harrison was on equal footing with Lennon and McCartney, he was a member of the band, not a sidekick or employee. Or hindrance in some minds. If `In Spite...' was not enough, `Cry For A Shadow' by Harrison and Lennon is the next Beatles original composition to be recorded. There's a trend beginning. And at the end of their RECORDING career, the last song to ever be recorded while all four members were alive, was Harrison's (with help from McCartney) `I Me Mine'. Had Harrison not met Paul McCartney, and knowing how life has many twists and turns, you would never have had The Beatles to begin with. I am suggesting something here. Whether you pick up on it or not, isn't really what I can control. I'm just suggesting that `The Quiet One' was a lot louder in other ways than can be perceived on the surface. There are many circles that run throughout the living of life, and it is quite possible Harrison's circle was quite powerful, and a bit more encompassing than some would like to believe. It doesn't take anyone remarkably observant to note that Harrison is riding the only dark horse in the Penny Lane promo. Nor to notice that as his partners signed away their copyright ownership, he was busy forming his own publishing company. There's quite a bit about Harrison a lot of people underestimate him on, and I think in the end, he's going to surprise a lot of people that look at a puddle, and think because its comprised of water, it's the same as the ocean.<br /><br />Back to my satisfaction in 1987. Harrison released the triumphant Cloud Nine to a public that had written him off. Not that he cared much, because he walked away very quietly and with little fanfare. He had a garden to tend to, and a son to raise, a wife to devote his time to, a film company that was helping save the British Film industry, and a lawsuit over a nice song with nothing Bright about it, while The Jam played a song that sounded a little too much like a song called `Taxman'. He was still extremely busy without putting out full albums. He also played with Carl Perkins and Ringo Starr, appeared in a movie with Ringo and Eric Clapton, went and tried salvaging what was left of Madonna's and Sean Penn's fiasco ridden Shanghai Surprise, contributed a song to the Porky's soundtrack, performed at The Prince's Trust, received a citation and a cheque of £11,000,000 from UNICEF for his work for Bangladesh, and that money was all the royalties that were accrued when the entire benefit was held up in court. His battles with EMI and the British/American governments over Bangladesh were enough to give him a Knighthood, let alone a citation from those whom he was trying to help. He was a very busy, if not always seen, George Harrison.<br /><br />When Cloud Nine came out, I was one of those happiest for George's success. We always knew he had it in him; it just took a matter of patience waiting for all the other spectators of the race to notice he had emerged victorious. He's not the richest former Beatle. He's not the martyred former Beatle. But he was the former Beatle that won an altogether different race. One that said all thosewho walked away from the grounds cursing because they had not bet on the wildcard of being the first and last to do something time and time again in relation to the other `horses', even though they seemed like they were in no way able to lose. They realised, or have yet to realise, the race was not about winning on the sure bet, or The Winnings. The track is a circle, it begins where it ends. And looking at Harrison's history, he seems to always be right there at the beginning, and right there at the end. It barely, if ever, changes. `My Sweet Lord' and `Got My Mind Set On You'. `In Spite of All The Danger' and `I Me Mine'. The first charity single in pop history. The first large scale benefit concert in pop history. The last former Beatle album to be released on the Apple label proper. The first proper solo album while in The Beatles. The first to address social/political commentary in the Beatles catalogue. The first of his peers to fully incorporate Indian instrumentation into Western pop music, by not emulating the Sitar with a Stratocaster, but actually playing the Sitar, and learning it for 2 years with Ravi Shankar. The only Beatle who was able to read and write music, even if it was Indian notation. The first triple album in pop/rock history. One of the first, and few people in 1960's Britain who publicly welcomed the Asian community, and went out of his way to promote their culture, their beliefs and their musicians. One of the first British musicians to own a Moog synthesiser, and one of the first, if not the first, musicians to release an album entirely composed on Moog synthesiser that was not an interpretation of classical music.<br /><br />The list truly goes on and on, as to why those that were betting should have known to bet on the dark horse.<br /><br />Cloud Nine is the most Beatle sounding of any of Harrison's recordings. But this should be no surprise, since so much of the Sonics, the sounds of The Beatles lay so much in his fingers. From the Rickenbacker, to Sitar, to the Synthesiser, to meticulously arranged backwards guitar solos, from Spanish guitar to psychedelic organ, George Harrison was quite simply the man who gave The Beatles `Sound'. One would like to think this is with the George Martin's, or the Geoff Emerick's. But neither of these people told Harrison to get a Rickenbacker. Or play a Sitar. They helped him recreate Fog in music when writing `Blue Jay Way', but did not write what required such an artistic use of effects. Martin only emulated what Harrison's Indian notation told his Indian friends to play. Martin could not communicate to an Indian musician, please play Sa ri ga ma pa dha ni. Harrison could. Martin's orchestration is based more on Harrison's instruction, than Martin's own writing skills, because he was naïve in dealing with Indian music, and Indian musicians. Some might suggest ignorant. Western music is comprised of 12 octaves. Indian music is comprised of 22 octaves. You do not know how large the Piano that would have to be built to play Indian music on a Western instrument would need to be. In Indian music, 12 keys are not enough to make an octave.<br /><br />Cloud Nine is a joy to listen to, particularly for George's guitar work, the production, Jeff Lynne's collaborations and contributions, and the songs themselves. Each one is a great addition to the Harrison catalogue of great work. The remaster makes an omission or two for no apparent reason, and I have yet to figure out why `Hottest Gong In Town' was not included in the additional tracks. Or 3 songs that were recorded after Cloud 9's release. And one is an absolute must have. All 3 appeared on the Best of Dark Horse collection in 1989, and these songs need to be released again. They are POOR LITTLE GIRL, COCKAMAMIE BUSINESS, and CHEER DOWN (written with Tom Petty). And it's `Cheer Down' of these 3 that ranks among the very best songs Harrison ever wrote, but what is even more magical, is his slide guitar work for this song. I'm a huge fan of the other two songs as well, particularly Cockamamie Business, but Cheer Down is a song that sits amongst Harrison's best work very comfortably. Why they are not included here, along with the glaring omission of `Hottest Gong In Town' is beyond me. And why not, if it couldn't be put on Somewhere In England, include `Lay His Head' on this set, which was the B-side of `Got My Mind Set On You'. Why not the alternate mixes of `Got My Mind Set On You' and `When We Was Fab'? There are a lot of missed opportunities on what is regarded as one of Harrison's biggest successes. But then again, EMI haven't really known what to do with George Harrison. I say this in respect to Olivia, who may have had more to do with this, or not at all. My complaint is not with her, because these albums are out there in the stores because of her, which is where they always belonged.<br /><br />CLOUD NINE is simply a must have.<br /><br />Bet on the Dark Horse, you'll get what you invested returned to you, and a lot extra..

The cats try to impress their leader and prove that they should be given a new life.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|This is one of the few movies that keeps you thinking about it days after watching it. The basic plot is enough to stimulate even the most genius of people. As far as the acting goes, you really don't get much better than this. What makes this movie leaps and bounds better than other movies of this sort is that the execution is flawless and it makes you think. From beginning to end this movie keeps your attention and keeps you guessing at what might happen next.<br /><br />The story revolves around Donnie Darko, a teen that doesn't quite fit in. He has two sisters and parents that are making him see a shrink. It's with his shrink that some of his inner-most thoughts are spoken. It's also with his shrink where he tells of his encounters with the mysterious Frank. Gretchin, his girlfriend, does help to take his mind off of the strange happenings that are going on around him at times, but at night is when everything happens to him. Mrs. Sparrow, also known as \\"Grandma Death,\\" seems to be his guide through what he experiences throughout this film. Her book, The Philosophy Of Time Travel, becomes Donnie's bible through his troublesome 28 days.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, the acting is second to none. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) couldn't have portrayed a troubled teen better. Every second he's on screen you just become engrossed with him, nobody could've done a better job. Jena Malone (Gretchin) is also believable. She too is a troubled teen with an extremely perilous past. Her and Jake's romance is, to say the least, acted out perfectly. Also along for the ride is Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Patrick Swayze, and Mary McDonnell. All of which seem to have brought they're A game. Donnie's family, I feel, was casted perfectly. The way they interact and talk to each other is so true to real life it's scary. Part of the reason they mesh so amazingly is because Jake's real sister was cast as his sister in the film. Pure genius.<br /><br />Overall this is without a doubt my favorite film of all time. However hard it is to understand you are rewarded greatly for paying attention. The ending, while I was a bit disappointed for them not including the extra bit, was amazing. A great end to a flawless film. I also really admired how they didn't just spell everything out for you, they let you fill in the blanks with what you think might've happened.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie could have been so much better if it had avoided the absurd portrayal of Japanese people. That wasn't good and hurts the film in the long run. Yes, I  can relate to the loneliness of these two characters and finding someone to share that with. Everyone at one point or another has felt lost at certain times in his or her life, highschool, young adulthood, relationships, mid-life identity crises...the list goes on and on, but I couldn't understand why these two characters were so weak, especially since they are unhappy with thier lives in America, wouldn't it make sense that they be interested in alternative lifestyles? It wasn't believable that two people in an interesting foreign country would be so fridgid about experiencing the different culture there unless they were snobs.  It's a shame that we don't get to see what happens when they get back to America and how they deal with their problems there. That would be a very interesting movie.
0679805273|5.0|I think a lot of people should read Dr. Suess's book \\"Oh the places youll go\\". It is a good book for children to read because it has a lot of made up things in it and it also has a lot of rymes. It is a good book for using your imagination and having fun with reading. I remember reading it as a child and it seemed more fun to me when I was younger but now that i have mutured it has made more sence to me but it is still a really fun book to read.
0800177177|4.0|I saw this film when it was first released and it has stayed stayed in my mind as the best movie made about Dracula. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that this is Francis Ford Coppela's version of the classic story because he went deeper into the story and delved into Dracula's motives for his evil. It was a good decision because it works better on film and also keeps it from being just a hack and slash horror movie with one big bad that everyone hates.    The wardrobe and set designs are beautiful and atmospheric, as is the music which is romantic, exciting and errie at the fitting moments. Two of the best scenes is poor Lucy in all white and the awesome race against the sunset, very well done. The only thing that I don't think was as good as it could have been is Keanu Reeves' fake British accent because it was very obvious in some of his scenes. All in all a well made horror film worth seeing.
0060955775|4.0|The title of this book would normally be a turn-off for me.  I wouldn't even consider reading it if my very own daughter, Arianna, hadn't mentioned it so excitedly to her friend, Laura, last August 2004.  I finally found a used copy and I'm very glad I read it now.  Paulo Coelho simply adds so much to one's life in his profound words (and definitely read THE ALCHEMIST--if you haven't already!).  'No one should let themselves get used to anything'.  Hey that last sentence is in this book!  I'd highly recommend this book for any person who is psychologically 'in the know' and/or who has an inkling of minimal depression during the trials and tribulations of living a routine life.  Everyone has an unusual story to tell--is another line in this book and the Eduard character is clearly semi-autobiographical to Paulo's own life.  Another good reminder from this book is to make sure you get enough 'sunlight' in your life.  It DOES make a difference!
B0007PAMR4|4.0|In response to the preliminary info posted above, you cannot crop a 4:3 image into scope. What is being advertised is a true anamorphic widescreen version of the extended edition, which has never before been available. There's no reason to believe that the original elements for the extended scenes do not exist, and these scenes were originally shot in 2.35:1 so I wouldn't worry about this release unless Universal retracts their announcement. Many films were panned & scanned for television and we now have their original versions available on DVD today. Now this is not to suggest that Universal hasn't got a big job on their hands. Many of these extended shots will have to be completed and cleaned up in order to be presented in widescreen, so it should be interesting to see what they come up with. I'd pay attention to reviews when we get closer to May and if it turns out to be a proper restoration, treat yourself and buy it immediately!
B00007KQKM|3.0|In all honesty, this version of the familiar story is a bit too much. A bit too much graphic sex that is. I was actually embarassed for the actors while watching the sex scenes. And running about the meadow naked? That's a brave pair of actors!!!And while I think most women have no objection to seeing Mr. Bean's (Sean that is-NOT Rowan Atkinson) backside, I did not relish seeing it in constant motion (if you know what I mean). I think all of the sex got in the way of the love story. I didn't feel the love growing between Mellors and Lady Chatterly. The relationship seemed to go from sexual obscession devoid of love to sacrificial love in 0-3 seconds.  <br />Parts of this film were reminiscent of cheesy old pornos with all of the noisy sex and unfitting music.  <br />I suppose if titilating sex scenes are your interest, then you will like this film. But if you are easily embarassed or offended by the above described material you would do better to avoid seeing this one.
B0006399FS|1.0|Remember the late eighties and the early nineties? Those were the U2 years, who along with Dire Straits and Guns 'n Roses, were the best band on the planet. Their last truly great album was \\"Achtung baby\\", released fourteen years ago. Their last truly great song was \\"Beautiful day\\" (which by the way was the only great song in \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" album), released five years ago.<br /><br />  \\"How to dismantle an atomic bomb\\" is one of the weakest things the band has ever released, notwithstanding a slew of ecstatic reviews of salivating rock critics. \\"Vertigo\\", the leadoff single is the typical example of what is really wrong with the band in the last years: it's a riff desperately trying to become a song. But it doesn't, it never really does!<br /><br />  I understand that when compared to other bands or singers music that we've been listening to lately, \\"How to dismantle an atomic bomb\\" may stand out as being a rather good album. But I still get the goose bumps when I listen to songs like \\"Bullet the blue sky\\", \\"Desire\\", \\"With or without you\\", \\"Pride\\", \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for\\", \\"One\\", etc. And I suspect I'm not the only one who feels this way. Those were great songs which made U2 a truly great band. Nowadays, some people complain about the lyrics of their latest songs. But folks, since the early nineties, the tunes simply aren't there anymore!
B000002BFL|5.0|I would put this on the top of my all time greatest albums...and definitely one of Bruce's top albums.  This record is not for the folks who like light hearted rockin tunes like \\"Ramrod\\" or \\"Cadiallac Ranch\\"...this is something completely different and very intimate.  Bruce was at a crossroads when he made this record...46 years old, just had a mini reunion with the E street Band for a couple of tracks on the greatest hits...but he was struggling to find \\"his rock voice\\" at that time....his singing style suggests this on Joad.  Instead of doing the commerically obvious choice (reunite the band, record and tour) he chose to follow his muse...and no matter what you think of the actual record, you have to respect that.   Springsteen chose to talk about America's poor through the voices of Mexican immigrants, veterans, lonely souls.  This album is rich with the soil of america's past and conects Steinbecks world to the present day America.  Its a deep and scary record....its truly amazing how Springsteen steps inside each characters world....he may be a millionare, but you would never know it listening to this CD. <br /> <br />The songs: <br />Title cut is amazing, connecting the world of Steinbeck to now...still poor in America and getting worse (thanks Dubbya!) <br /> <br />2. Straight Time:  the character in this song is trying to find whats lost...and how sometimes the things that make us happy are not healthy things....ex con deals with the real world and trys to walk the straight line...amazing lyrics! <br /> <br />3. Highway 29- an affair gone terribly wrong...sung by a ghost...i think <br /> <br />4. Youngstown- America during Reagan (and now) industry and out sourcing...jobs gone....amazing song. <br /> <br />5. Sinaloa Cowboys, brings you into a world that not many of us know exsisted...Mexican immigrants <br /> <br />6. The line, again a beautiful character study...life is not so black and white, Bruce tells us threw this border patrol widower. <br /> <br />7. Balboa park, again the work of immigrants, Mexican boys selling themselves for money and drugs....hard life, dark song. <br /> <br />8.Dry Lighting, talking about men and women, one of my favorites on the CD <br /> <br />9. The new timer, riding the rails.... <br /> <br />10. across the border, is there salavation in the mix? <br /> <br />11. Galvaston Bay, Vietnam vets vs Vietnamise immigrants...brilliant. <br /> <br />12. my best was never good enough....lighter fair than the rest of the cd but I guess he had to end on somewhat of a light note. <br /> <br />There really isn't enough room to really go into track by track, bottom line is I bought the CD when it first came out and I was floored....Bruce really makes you feel the lives of this characters....its really his best work, yes I love to rock out to the E street band too, but thats not what this CD is about...everyone should own this...amazing thanks Bruce!

0684135051|2.0|I bought this book thinking it was for a beginner, I have since expanded my knitting skills and have become much more advanced.  Even as a advanced knitter, this book for me was hard to follow.  The directions written in general terms and not as clear and concise as I would like.  I guess I am a little anal about the kind of pattern I like.  Specific number of stiches, not 23% of total number of stiches on needle #3 and 35% on needle # 4.  This book is not for anyone who is not very good with numbers, especially percentages.
B0002S947K|5.0|I have just over 1000 CDs and this one has bumped out whatever was in second place. (My favorite is still Patty Griffin, \\"Living with Ghosts\\") The songs \\"Trouble\\", \\"Hannah\\", and especially \\"Shelter\\" are some of the best I own.  Very impressive for a debut CD from a relative novice singer/songwriter.  His production and the groove of several of the songs are very remeniscent of \\"into the mystic\\" and \\"Tupelo Honey\\" era Van Morrison, as well as others like The Band, but who cares, this is better Van than Van's put out in twenty years, and he's a far better singer than anyone in the Band. (no offense, I'm a huge fan of both and have 26 Van discs.) Ray is the real deal. So He's a white guy who sings soul, does that mean he's unqualified? Buy Solomon Burke too, but don't miss out on this great and moving collection of songs.
B000002GK1|5.0|The best Soundgarden album in Heavy terms (in experimental terms \\"superunknown\\" would win the tittle of course) , from beginning to end \\"badmotorfinger\\" is a blast in riffs and drums as \\"rusty cage\\" prooves with speedy rithm very acelerated untill your breath is cut, then comes \\"outshined\\" with slow, deep and dense riffs, then \\"slaves and bulldozers\\" kinda in the mood of \\"outshined\\" but with energic vocals and long , very long and exciting shouts from Cornell in a bluesy-Zeppelinesque style,  this is the track were Chris proves plenty the awesome and powerfull voice he have , then \\"Jesus Christ pose\\" comes and madness once again is present, \\"face polution\\" very speed and crazy over again, \\"somewhere\\" is deligthfull , \\"searching with my good eye closed\\" is one of the few calm songs of this album , is also one of my favorites , \\"room a thousand years wide\\" is very different to the rest of cd , due to the stuning change of vocals Cornell performs here therefore this track is very enjoyable, \\"mind riot\\" provides a deserved rest to your nervs, its almost atmospheric, \\"drawing flies\\" starts again the acelerated riffs and mental shouts and caothic noise, \\"holy water\\" and \\"new damage\\" are acctually two final tracks that only acomplish to complete the album, however this album is amazing and one of the heaviest ever recorded, it cant be called grunge this is Heavy Metal at its purest form<br /><br />HM
038533348X|4.0|An apocalyptic satire of some of the institutions most easily satired-government, religion, military. But Vonnegut is wholly original, as always. His satire holds up today, and there is nothing expected about this book, which involves, among other things: the midget offspring of one of the inventors of the atomic bomb, a form of dangerous ice with the power to freeze people, a tropical island with natives exploited by Americans, and a made-up religion that is just weird enough to be believable. My only criticism, if any, is that although I found the characters interesting, hilarious at times, I wasn't emotionally attached to any of them. I didn't enjoy it as much as Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions, but it was a good read nonetheless.
B0007GADZO|5.0|<br />OK, what the problem is with you all is that your thinking too much in the terms of what Vai use to do, or what is out now n' days. Just listen to it. His music isn't meant to impress you or \\"blow you away\\" with his \\"speed of light fingers\\". If you want that go to his concert, or buy one for that matter. His music is meant to tell you something he can't say verbally, it's meant to share his emotions with you. Sure a lot of the stuff is weird and \\"out there\\", but that's how Steve Vai is. Come on what were expecting, a regular album. And for all you that say it sounds too much like his other stuff, maybe because it is like his other stuff as in the fact that \\"he wrote it\\". Isn't that why you bought the album in the first place, because you were familiar with his other works and wanted to hear more of it. If you like music for the reason it was made for then buy this album because it truly is a beautiful piece of art.   <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|There once was a time, seems like decades ago now, when U2 was name checked in the liner of Sublime's bands in the world. <br /> <br />Now U2 are wearing a lot more clothes and less honesty. By 2000 U2 had started appearing on collaborative hits and on the covers of any magazine they could undress for. U2 became another Hollywood faces. Sellouts.  <br /> <br />Exhaustingly heared before, this crap is the most unoriginal U2 album ever made. And if you want to buy this can of Red Bull, that's yours. It's hermetically sealed post-millennial adult contemporary piffle for people who'd prefer not to break a sweat. <br />Desperate to keep licking the honey pot, U2's  enlisted a menagerie of outdated producers like Eno, Lillywhite, Lanois, etc, in order to sell the name of U2 alone again. The subject matter on the indistinguishably titled How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is painfully mainstream throughout <br /> <br />There's nothing here but an attempt to be like everybody: dull, plastic, sellout, monotonous, and not a sign of life...not one sign of the U2 I once knew. I get from this album now will be pounded out of me by having to listen to it at every music shop, restaurant, grocery store, and waiting room I go to for the next two years.  <br /> <br />

B000001GE5|5.0|It takes a very great artist to be able to play pieces which have been overperformed and overtaught, and bring something fresh to the table.  Pollini does just that, especially in his performances of the Preludes and Etudes.   <br /> <br />I would love to take a poll of the pianists and piano teachers here to see how many times they have taught the Chopin Preludes. From my own experience, I've taught these pieces so many times that I find myself dreading teaching #4 (e minor), #6 (b minor), #7 (A Major) or #20 (c minor) -- and I think we forget that these pieces are actual music and NOT \\"teaching pieces\\".   <br /> <br />Pollini succeeds in taking these over-played pieces and transforming them back into \\"music\\".  It's really nothing short of amazing.  As I listened, I began noticing secondary melodies I'd never heard, particularly in #5 (D Major), #13 (F-Sharp Major), and #14 (e-flat minor).  The F-Sharp Major Prelude is particularly gorgeous -- almost heart-rendingly so in the middle section.  The g-sharp minor Prelude has exactly the right sense of fire and drive to bring this piece across; the A-Flat Major, E-Flat Major and F Major Preludes are nothing short of ravishing.   <br /> <br />I bought this CD collection on suggestion of a friend of mine (also a pianist) who has experienced the same kind of burn-out I have with Chopin pieces which are over-taught and over-played,  and/or over-interpreted to the point where the pieces become parodies of themselves.  (I never heard so much bad, truly affected Chopin playing as I did at the school where I initially trained as a pianist!).   <br /> <br />Pollini's Chopin is a real breath of fresh air -- restrained, elegantly timed rubatos; enough pedal to effect tonal coloring without the overpedalling so common in so many Chopin performances; a sense of drama in the playing combined with an edge of restraint so the pieces are never \\"over-played\\"; and he has an uncanny ability to convey a strong sense of structure to these pieces. <br /> <br />I can say quite honestly that the performances of the Preludes and Etudes on this CD have the force of a revelation.  The proof of this is that after hearing the CD (many times), I have decided to learn all 24 Preludes (plus the C-Sharp Minor Prelude, op. 45) and play them all in a recital. <br /> <br />The Polonaises aren't quite as spellbinding as the Preludes and as riveting as the Etudes; but the Preludes and Etudes make this a compelling collection.  I strongly and enthusiastically recommend this  CD compilation!
B000641Z90|5.0|Phil Collins is superb.  Recorded live in Paris in HD.  This is a DVD / HD transfer - as close to HD as you can get without being HD.  If you have an HDTV you will surely enjoy this concert and the DTS soundtrack along with it.  All the songs are here and the audience is into it.  I believe it deserves a 5 star rating - but I don't like all the flashy multi-colored lighting behind the band.  It's kind of a distraction - well actually it is a distraction.  Much better with the blue / black background lighting - the true colors appear more realistic.  The light show was someones foolish idea - no doubt - reminds me of the flashy light show in the background for the Elton John live DVD - One Night Only - but I expect that from him.  Buy this if you like Phil Collins - you will not be dissapointed - a must have.....
B000002I97|5.0|It is easy to see why John Prine became a cult favorite in the 70's.  Certainly his wink to the High Life \\"Illegal Smile\\" was popular, but this group of songs also exemplified the zeitgeist of anti-authoritarian social consciousness.  Listening to them now, many have an almost iconic feel.  Hello In There, Sam Stone, Paradise, Donald and Lydia, sound like we've always known them.  I saw Prine in concert last fall right before the election, and he sang Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore.  He introduced the song by saying that he had retired it.  He even had it stuffed and hung on his wall.  But lately he had been getting requests for it.  Yes, President Bush had been asking for it and he was going to give it to him.  This comment shows the humor that humanizes and softens much of Prine's social commentary and keeps him from being shrill.  The other trait of his that is demonstrated so well in this CD is Prine's compassion.  The song Angel From Montgomery is an accepted classic.  But this song, sung from an old woman's perspective, was written by a young man.  And he got it right.  I was introduced to Prine by a lady friend back in the 90's who loved the line \\"How the Hell can a person go to work in the morning and come home in the evening and have NOTHING to say?\\"  She thought that accurately reflected her own taciturn husband. After seeing Prine in concert I decided to go back and purchase a lot of his earlier work.  Like him, I started with this one. If you like his work, so should you.
B000059XUO|5.0|In one horrible moment everything can change, and your life and the lives of those you loved can be destroyed by men consumed by evil. But, what if you had a chance to return to exact vengeance upon whomever was responsible for such an event? This was the basis for the 1994 gothic-infused action film \\"The Crow\\" based on the comic book created by James O'Barr.    \\"The Crow\\" follows the quest for revenge that consumes Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) upon his return from the dead one year after he and his fiancée, Shelly, were brutally murdered by a deadly gang. Assisting him in his mission are a mystical crow, a former detective turned beat cop (Ernie Hudson), and a young girl that he and Shelly used to care for. Now, one by one Eric is picking off those responsible for that horrific night, so that his soul may finally know peace. However, the gang isn't willing to just go down without a fight, and their leader (Michael Wincott) has his eye on gaining the supernatural power that drives this new hero.    When this film was released it had been two years since Tim Burton's \\"Batman Returns\\" had met with mixed reviews from critics and moviegoers alike, and the comic book movie craze was still years away. So, to adapt a relatively obscure title such as this one, amidst a fickle public regarding dark heroes (audiences embraced Burton's first Batman movie, but shunned the second due to its darker tone); not to mention using a fairly unproven actor as your star, made \\"The Crow\\" a potentially risky endeavor. Yet, the gamble paid off across the board, and to this day the movie remains one of the strongest comic book adaptations ever created.    Charged with adapting this lesser-known comic book into a potential feature film were scribes David J. Schow (\\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning\\") and John Shirley (\\"The Specialist\\"). Finding success with comic book inspired movies during the nineties was not the easiest of challenges to complete. So, why is it that this comic book movie, dark overtones and all, was able to succeed where many others failed?    Well, as with any comic book movie, one of the most important elements that must be present is a respect for the source material, and the willingness to stay as close to said material as possible. Of course, when dealing with not only a dark and gritty source, but also one steeped heavily into the supernatural, staying true could result in an alienation of virtually everyone except for the most ardent of fans. Even so, the writers stayed the course, remained as faithful as possible (there were some changes and omissions, but in my estimation they were for the better) and delivered to audiences a hard-hitting, fast-paced, and undeniably entertaining action flick that succeeded despite the odds.    Within the movie's story there are many interesting segments, as any good movie should have over its duration. For many viewers I'm sure the action scenes were some of the most memorable, and of course exciting moments. To me the portions that really sold the movie were the quieter, more introspective scenes that delved deeper into the various characters of the film.    For two writers that had previously dealt with either crappy horror sequels or a couple of episodes for Saturday morning cartoons, the amount of solid, intriguing character development was surprising. At the time, it seemed that the mind set for comic book movies was to go bigger, better, and louder with the action sequences, and if the story suffered in the process, so be it. This would prove to be a fatal blow for one of the biggest superhero franchises around at that time; it's just too bad nobody heeded the warning signs to prevent the issue. Thankfully, the writers of \\"The Crow\\" were wise enough to avoid this type of mistake, thus the movie was able to do well.    Two other key aspects to the movie remaining believable and enjoyable were keeping it grounded by terrific performances and having a visually stylistic director. Obviously, getting the story right is paramount for any film to thrive, but when dealing with this type of movie, not having the right director and/or actors can be extremely detrimental no matter how incredible the script.    Leading the cast with a star-making performance is actor Brandon Lee (\\"Rapid Fire\\"). As Eric Draven, Brandon delivers an excellent performance that is often times full of rage, intensity and sadness, but during the flashbacks we see a fun-loving and caring individual that possesses a charisma that instantly captures your attention. It's that ability to convey such a wide range of emotions in a single performance that would have made Brandon a massive success. Sadly, this rising star was accidentally killed during the filming of this movie, and much like his late father (Bruce Lee), his end came far too soon.    In the most noteworthy supporting roles are actors Ernie Hudson (\\"The Substitute\\") and Michael Wincott (\\"Alien: Resurrection\\"). Ernie's portrayal of Sergeant Albrecht, an officer who discovers that Eric has returned and assists him in his pursuit for revenge, is plagued by some minor bouts of clichéd dialogue. Yet, in the end the sincerity and earnestness in his portrayal carried the character well beyond the flaws.    As for Michael Wincott's performance, his gravelly and menacing voice helped make him a perfect choice to portray the leader of the gang. Displaying such an obvious disdain for anything good or righteous in this world and a somewhat twisted sense of humor provides for a chilling and memorable performance for Michael, but also an excellent villain for this type of movie.    Lastly, serving as the glue that binds all of the various aspects of the movie together is director Alex Proyas (\\"I, Robot\\"). Taking an obvious cue from Tim Burton's work on \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\", the look of the film is undeniably gothic from the characters to the architecture. To the point, that there are moments that one could begin to wonderif some of the set pieces were simply brought over after those two films wrapped. Beyond the drab look of the film, Proyas moves out from Burton's shadow to create a world consumed by darkness and evil that could arguably be more hopeless than that of Gotham City.    Then there's the terrific camera work that gave the movie an even more distinctive style, from the establishing shots of the city via the mystical crow's arrival to the kinetically-charged action sequences that are guaranteed to get the adrenaline pumping. Every scene was well staged and executed to deliver an all-out satisfying experience for moviegoers. Aside from the borrowing of the color pallet from the aforementioned movies (and even that's forgivable), Alex Proyas proved he was the right man to bring this particular comic book adaptation to cinematic life.    Featuring a talented cast and great performances, a surprisingly well-conceived story, and action sequences jam-packed with intensity, \\"The Crow\\" is a thoroughly entertaining action film that absolutely leaves you wanting more.    \\"The Crow\\" is rated R for violence, language, sexuality, and brief nudity.
0743455967|5.0|Normally, I'm not a big Stephen King fan, but I found this book one day when browsing through the bookstore and picked it up. Part-autobiography and part-writing advice, this is very helpful to hopeful writers. Packed with good advice, as well as stories about his own writing experiences, it is sure to inspire anybody to get down to work. As an aspiring novelist myself, this book definitely inspired me and got me to look more critically at my own work. And I suggest college students majoring in creative writing to read this. <br /> <br />It's definitely worth it.
B0006399FS|1.0|In eliminating both the mystery of its early years and the restless avant garde spirit of 90's times, U2 leaves just exactly what U2 haters probably felt the band made all along: midtempo, largely hookless adult corporate pop. It's a shame to see the detractors proved right.  <br /> <br />Where is this depth?. Simply, nobody can describe this as groundbreaking or original. It's just recycling past glories in search of a `classic' sounding album that fan base should be able to embrace. It's 11 'new mixes' - as bad as those ones presented on 'Best of?' 1990-2000 - of ATYCLB. The production values on this lame attempt at U2 are equally indefensible. Every single track sounds like it could have been written, I mean, copy-paste on a laptop, and much needed qualities such as 'Please' and 'The Fly' are completely non-existent.  <br /> <br />It's hard to figure out how U2 sees itself in 2004; whether it has an idea of where it wants to go, musically, or even whether it realizes that it's making music that's far removed from the forward-thinking ambition that defined its amazing sound as 90's underrated POP. <br /> <br />I think MONEY & COMPLACENCY have taken its toll. A big dissappointment  <br /> <br /> <br />
0385513755|5.0|What can I say, this book opened me eyes and mind for alot of things, about the world I both am and am not apart of. This book is fantastic, for people who know everything and nothing. I would recommend it. It is one of the best books I have every read.
B000001EAQ|5.0|This is an album I don't want to skip a minute of. You know how most albums have some songs that are just too filler and you skip ont he the next track before the song is over? Actually, honestly most albums have at least one or two whole songs that you skip over. Well POP isn't most albums. <br /> <br />This is an album of incredible work. U2 established themselves as one of the most outstanding rock bands the '90s had to offer.  <br /> <br />The triumphant 'Discotheque' could only work as the set's opener: It's an encompassing declaration of intent, defining the exploratory boundaries of POP. 'Do You Feel Loved' exposes the U2's potential future - that's what we believed at that time - and 'Mofo' It's a dizzying stereo-panned techno rock, and one of POP's. The first 3 songs just turn me on. The electronic beeps, beats and weird goings-on are just out-of-body. 'If God Will Send His Angels' is an amazing statement, as well 'Staring At The Sun'. The first one is more like a ballad, but 'Staring' isn't exactly a ballad. Electronic sounds still are present. <br /> <br />With 'Miami' U2 is a band in total control, unafraid to deconstruct traditional song structures, to throw a monkey wrench into the proceedings and still maintain an overriding sense of authority. Their most underrated song ever. 'Last Night On Earth' and 'Gone' are transporting. The experimentalism of 'If You Wear That Velvet Dress' is a statement. 'Please' is simply the last great U2 song, unlike what we found on HTDAAB and ATYCLB, resignation is not welcome here. <br /> <br />BUY IT NOW! <br /> <br />
B00005RY7X|2.0|Let's get this straight: This isn't irony..Andrew W.K. is completely serious. For him, all of life is loud music, chicks, and beer.<br /><br />If your idea of what to do with a million dollars is \\"two chicks at once, man\\"...this might be your CD.<br /><br />If you believe that there are 24 beers in a case because there are 24 hours in a day...this might be your CD.<br /><br />If the cops appear more than once at any party you throw with noise complaints....this might be your CD.<br /><br />If you own only three types of clothing (white T-shirts...black concert shirts..and worn blue jeans)..this might be your CD.<br /><br />For the rest of us, this is best described as a \\"mood CD\\". When you want to hear loud and dumb ditties that don't demand much of you, this will fill the bill. (He doesn't strain your attention span either..only 2 songs run over 3:30).<br /><br />But for general listening, only the catchy \\"She is Beautiful\\" and witty \\"Ready to Die\\" (which is so over the top it must be a death metal parody)  really stand out.
B00005MP58|2.0|It's all very well for reviewers to rave about Colin Firth's brooding Darcy.  He does well enough, given that he has no-one to play against.  The smirking, complacent Jennifer Ehle is so badly miscast as Elizabeth that the entire production is undermined.  The shrill overacting of Alison Steadman and the (again) miscasting of Jane do not help.  The book is far more subtle, with nuances completely ignored by the scriptwriter who prefer to have Elizabeth constantly striking pert poses as a substitute for the actress having to display any emotion.  This is like watching Gone With The Wind without Vivien Leigh.  If the two leads are mismatched the entire point is lost, no matter how elaborate the production values.

B000005RQT|5.0|To me this is the greatest hard rock album ever made on the face of this earth, its a tall claim, but I guarantee that once you listen to it you will also put it up there with the best of the best in Rock/Metal. <br /> <br />Harsh, loud, furious with break neck speed, this album is a monster that has never been matched by any other band. The album may initially sound  a bit dated but in no time the music and songs will take you over. <br /> <br />'Child in time' is the epic track with a mellow start to screeching vocals from Ian Gillan arguably the best in his business. The fantastic Guitar solo by Ritchie goes to show what an Influence he was to all of the 'Eddie's and Malmsteem's'.  <br /> <br />This solo features on the movie 'Twister' too but the accompanying visual of Ritchie is from the Calafornia Jam. <br /> <br />The other greats are 'Speed King' (a real racy one) and 'Flight of the Rat' (with a simple but amazing riff by the Man in Black), it also has a great drum solo by Ian Paice. <br />'Hard loving man' is another harsh song with great searing guitar work and vocals, a precursor to the later Speed and Thrash metal by other bands. <br /> <br />'Into the fire', 'Living Wreck' and 'Bloodsucker' are the other numbers on the album. All very fine songs with real fun lyrics on 'Living Wreck' and wonderful screechy vocals on `Bloodsucker'that the band covered on their 'Abandon' album. <br /> <br />Though am not mentioning Jon Lord, his work on the keys is an integral part of the album and can be felt everywhere at times mellowing the song at others giving it the hardness. <br /> <br />All in all a great innovative riff based album with great vocals by Ian. One cannot discount the contributions of the other members in making this the greatest Hard rock album ever. <br /> <br /> <br />On 'In Rock' Deep Purple have woven noise into a web of unforgettable music. How a band has been able to achieve this I will never know. <br /> <br />Sad that a masterpiece such as 'In Rock' never made it big in the US, `In Rock' was in the shadows of 'Machine head'. This album stayed in the British charts for over a year and is the album which influenced bands like 'Iron Maiden' and 'Judas Priest' among several others. <br /> <br />Deep Purple is one of the best Rock Bands in the world and the reason is \\"In Rock\\". <br />
B00005JKZU|1.0|When I first saw this, I didn't much like it. <br /> <br />So I went back and viewed it again, just to be sure. <br /> <br />I was right. <br /> <br />It's overlong, overwritten, dark, and pointless. <br /> <br />The first Lord of the Rings (the Fellowship) I liked better.  There the characters were fresh, the scenery bright and varied, the plot silly but negligible. <br /> <br />Here the scenes are almost all DARK.  Perhaps this is thematic: the journey has reached its nadir.  But the unrelieved gloom goes on too long.  And the characters, though unusual (Gollum, the Ents), are tedious. <br /> <br />Even worse is the writing.  When Sam oh-so-ponderously speculates on whether he and Frodo will ever be remembered or written about, I can hear Peter Jackson and even J.R.R. Tolkein laughing up their baggy medieval sleeves. <br /> <br />This kind of self-referential in-joke may appeal to fanatics; to me it was just pointless preening. <br /> <br />The main problem for me--and it just gets worse in the third movie, the Return--is the silliness of the plot, here dragged out to torpid length. <br /> <br />As for battles, seen one seen 'em all. <br /> <br />Guys (almost always guys) hacking each other to bits. <br /> <br />Fine for 14-year-old (or 7-year-old) males--I'm sure George W. Bush would like it.   But for adults it's a snoozer. <br /> <br />A lavish copious epic bore.

B00005KHEU|5.0|I know many of you ELO fans find that this is not one of their best albums but I still think this is definitely one of their most enjoyable excursions. Released after their much heralded \\"Out of The Blue\\" album, ELO continues with their tried and tested formula and somehow managed to score again with \\"Discovery\\" which features an even more exquisite blend of classical and electronic  rock.<br /><br />How can one not enjoy this album when it features such unforgettable melodies coupled with racy and thumping beats? \\"Last Train to London\\" and \\"Shine a Little Love\\" proved their successful formula all over again as these songs are immediately catchy and yet very original.<br /><br />Repeated listenings will uncover more gems like \\"Confusion\\", \\"Diary of Horace Wimp\\" and \\"On The Run\\". So many good songs and all in one album! How did they do it back then, huh?<br /><br />And if you are a sucker for romantic tunes, Jeff obliges well with  \\"Need Her Love\\" and \\"Midnight Blue\\". My, how can you fault these songs as they are definitely not soppy nor trashy at all but really good songs, period.<br /><br />Again this has to be one of their greatest albums as there are no dud songs here. Looking back, one wonders how they could manage to spring another blockbuster album after \\"Discovery\\". Yet \\"Time\\"  proved that no one else but E.L.O. could make such a comeback. And what a comeback it was. History will show that they were one of the greatest rock bands ever!<br /><br />And finally, for those unfortunate souls whom have not heard of E.L.O., this will be be one \\"Discovery\\" you will surely not regret!
B0002858YS|5.0|I'll be honest, I really thought that The Killers would be a one hit wonder. Their first single, 'Somebody Told Me', was insanely catchy, which was already a bad sign. I listened to the album at my local music store about a week after its release and really liked it, so I obviously bought it. I knew I liked the album, but still had a sinking feeling that no one else would and that The Killers would sink into one-hit-wonder-oblivion. Thankfully, 'Mr. Brightside' was released as a single soon after and became insanely popular. So now most people are sick of 'Mr. Brightside', but at least it's doubtful that The Killers won't soon disappear.    'Hot Fuss' starts out strong with 'Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine'. The song is about the murder of a woman named (surprise!) Jenny, but isn't as dark as you'd suspect. The sounds of an overhead search party at the beginning of the track were a great way to start out the song as well as the CD. Brandon Flowers' desperate pleas of innocence are fabulous, and surprisingly/frighteningly believeable. I really like this track and think it's a great opener for the album. 'Mr. Brightside' comes in next, and is among the best on the album. I don't know about anyone else, but where I am, the song was so ridiculously overplayed it's not even funny. However, I still don't find myself skipping it, which is a very good sign. The video is also amazing; done in a 'Moulin Rouge' theme, it's visually stunning and suits the song surprisingly well. 'Smile Like You Mean It' seems to be a favourite among friends of mine, but I just can't see it. I do like the song, but I think there are far better tracks on the album overall. It starts out slowly, then gradually builds up before the lyrics start. This track doesn't have a great beat, which is its main downfall. It relies far too much on lyrics, which is unfortunate because that seems to be the band's biggest fault. I'll say it now; don't get this album if you're looking for amazing lyrics, get it if you're looking for catchy melodies.     'Somebody Told Me' was the first single to drop from 'Hot Fuss' and I absolutely love it. It adds a modern twist to a retro idea, and the result is awesome. What The Killers produce is a fun, upbeat, danceable track that you just can't seem to get out of you're head once it's crawled in there. This is what music should be: fun. The album slows down quite a bit for 'All These Things That I've Done'. The beginning features Flowers singing and the simple sounds of a synthesizer, then the drums start up and the song really takes off. The lyrics are repetitive, but not to a point that leaves listeners annoyed. The climax is reached when all of the instruments except for drums are cut out and the lines \\"I got soul, but I'm not a soldier\\" are repeated until all the instruments have begun again and the fellow members of the band are singing along. 'Andy, You're A Star' is my favourite track from the album. It starts out with just a catchy electric guitar before breaking out with a synthesizer, drums, and then vocals. The opening is such that I could see where some people would find it pretentious, but it's the reason why I love the track so much. The lyrics are simple, which is good, because the dark, captivating melody is the main focus of this song.     'On Top' begins with just a synthesizer and what sounds like tambourines before the other instruments join in. This track is very good and it fits in well with the album, but it isn't a standout song. The lyrics are, once again, simple, but Flowers' vocals are smooth and fit very well with the music. My favourite part of the song comes with the lines \\"it's like a cigarette/in the mouth, or a/handshake in the doorway/I look at you, and smile because I'm fine\\". The ninth track on 'Hot Fuss' is 'Change Your Mind'. I find that this is a very lazy song, and leaves me thinking about slow summer days. I get the feeling that it's not meant to be heard as serious in any way. Although the lyrics seem to be slightly meaningful, the way that they're sung along with the music backing them up results in a fun and carefree song. 'Believe Me Natalie' is one of my personal favourites from the CD. It's midtempo, but has the attitude and the catchiness of an uptempo dance track. The simple, high school rhymes don't take themselves too seriously, which is endearing. They have fun with themselves and go well with the music. For example, \\"forget what they said in SoHo/leave the 'oh-no's out\\". Obviously not meaningful, but not necessarily bad in any way.    Nearing the end of the album, 'Midnight Show' opens with the same sort of bang as 'Somebody Told Me'. It's an uptempo (even though it's about killing a girlfriend) track. The vocals on this song are great as Flowers veers away from the same monotone (but not in a bad way) singing voice he maintained throughout the album. He reaches a couple of higher notes, and they sound great. They add a lot to the song and definitely don't sound goofy or out of place. Warning: this one will leave you bopping along in your seat. The album slows right down at the end with 'Everything Will Be Alright'. It starts out very much like 'On Top', but better. Though the lyrics still aren't deep or meaningful, they're at their best on this track. Simple, which suits the music very well, and Flowers' vocals really make the song unique and distinctive. This track possesses and almost dream-like, romantic quality, that leaves you feeling as though you're floating on air. It was a great way to close the album.    Overall, I'd recommend checking out The Killers' 'Hot Fuss' if you like catchy, retro beats. If you're the type of person who looks for deep and profound lyrics, you won't be pleased, so stay clear. If you want new wave to stay in the 80s, again, this is one to avoid (and so is Gwen Stefani's solo endeavor, as a side note). I'd recommend listening to this album before purchasing it, but overall, I think most people generally like it.THE FINAL VERDICT: 90%
0670033375|5.0|I was a little reluctant to dig into \\"Collapse\\"--life is hard enough, I thought to myself, without another diatribe about environmental destruction. But once again Jared Diamond has taken a complex and potentially agenda-driven subject and made it into a sparkling, fascinating read. The series of societal collapses that Diamond looks at here are never simplistic \\"those nasty humans screwed it all up\\" stories. The complex interaction of culture, climate and geography makes for absorbing reading, and Diamond has a real gift for telling detail--who would have thought that the kayak was such a triumph of engineering? This book is like a lifetime's worth of trips to exotic destinations and epochs in one volume. And Diamond never strains to make a point about every case--he can make you empathize with a Medieval Norse settler in one chapter and a Montana rancher in the next. Diamond is simply one of the best nonfiction writers working today, and you owe yourself a look at this book.
B000003S5H|2.0|I bought this CD without knowing what it was about. I knew the songs \\"Kelly, Watch the Stars\\" and \\"Sexy Boy\\", and as I liked them so much, I decided to buy the album. Thruth is the first time of listening to it, I hated it. I thought all the songs would be as creatively bizzare as the 2 songs I already knew. I have listened to it more, and another track that I liked well was \\"Remember Me\\", and maybe \\"New Star In the Sky\\", but I gotta say the rest of the songs definitively don't stand out. I hated tracks like \\"All I Need\\", which reminded me of Zero 7. I didn't like the voice of the girl singing, it bored me to death to listen to her... I feel like I've wasted my money. I don't think it's an album that grows on you... it sounds nothing very special, and I didn't like most of the elements since they're to simple, but in a bad way. I prefered Talkie Walkie better, a more complex album, with more evolutioned technologies and ideas, and peculiar songs.
B000000OSO|1.0|I bought this the day it came out, listened to it all the way through three times, and tossed it out the window of my apartment in Boston. The only songs I can stomach are \\"Livin' On The Edge\\" and one other one towards the end that I can't remember the name of...something about dancing. <br />Anyway, for all of the bashing that I hear about Rock..Hard Place and Done w/ Mirrors, this album is absolute crap. <br />Why they became so huge again in the late 80's is a complete mystery to me. Glossy production, horrible lyrics, unimaginative grooves and those horrible, HORRIBLE power ballads are NOT what made Aerosmith a classis band - Go buy Toys In The Attic or Rocks NOW...and toss this garbage in the trash where it belongs.
0385510454|4.0|I disagree with those reviews that are calling him a \\"has been\\".  That might be due to his trying to expand his writing direction with books like: A Painted House, Bleachers, and now The Broker.  If anything, I felt like it had hints of classic Grishman: suspense, interesting characters, and intrigue.  One thing Grisham has always had a knack for, is getting you to feel for shady characters.  Joel Backman in The Broker is no different. I found myself pulling for a convicted felon! Do I think this is the best Grishman yet? No.  However, I did think it was a fun, escapist read.
B00028HBKM|4.0|The Passion of the Christ is a wonderful movie. Mel Gibson had a lot of guts to make a movie about Jesus told in such a violent way(which by the way is the way it happened...sad isn't it). Most people know that the movie isn't a happy movie that you can watch without crying. The movie is the most violent movie that I have ever seen. Because I heard the movie was so violent and gory, I was very skeptical about seeing this movie. But when my friend said that the movie changed her life, I decided to watch it with her. I ended up holding her hand almost the whole time (until the end of course because I needed both of my hands to wipe all of the tears away from my eyes. I have never cried so much in a movie. Even though the movie is very sad and extremely hard to watch, there are a few happy parts in the movie(especially the very end). I suggest any Christian and especially non-Christian to watch this spiritually moving movie.
B000001F29|4.0|I was born only 2 years after this album was released and came across a copy of it (on cassette) from my step dad.  He recommended it to me, noting its story telling qualities (Friends of Mr. Cairo) and thought I might like it for my lyrical ballet class.  I'm hooked!  So entertaining and smooth, I'll definitely use \\"Find my Way Home\\" for a recital piece next year.
B0002X314C|5.0|The smoke of ordinary sounds clogs the radio these days with the same old beats and words tiring the fans out. NOT THIS ONE The poweful debut lifts us to new highs with a raspy heard filled sound that is not ordinary in todays music. John Legend makes you feel him in every track. Ordinary People is a masterpiece that has to make the legendary Stevie Wonder say, \\"Now thats real.\\" The pain of growing up in urban music always guides us and teaches us a lesson in life. If Mary J. Blige is the Queen of Hip Hop Soul then John Legend is her male parallel because this is one that you will feel.

6304618344|1.0|It is rather hard to accept an action director who admits to basing his action sequences on Hollywood Musicals of some decades  ago. <br />The story is fine, and both Travolta and Cage give masterly performances. However, Woo has no concept of moderation or excess. In one gun battle, that apparently  took a sum total of 3 months  to complete,  Woo  seems to be so aware that it is excessive that he cuts the audio, and we hear what the child bystander is hearing. <br />Even the Marine Boat chase turns into a disaster, when the Stand-ins  cannot even keep their wigs on straight. Did Woo skip the dailies, or does he like a little farce? <br /> <br />It is utterly incomprehensible how such a good story was messed up by Woo's visual  hyperbole.This story might actually might have worked in the hands of a better director, or even if the edit could be done by someone with a sense of how an action movie can work. <br />The Highlights are definitely  around Cage and Travolta, since they did such great work, but ...

B000683VI4|5.0|I loved this movie.  It's right up there with The Thorn Birds.  I loved the era and the characters and I couldn't wait to see who Allie winded up with.    It's a keeper.
0743454537|4.0|After hearing so much hype about this novel, I finally had to read it.  Ultimately, I am glad I did. <br /> <br />When I began the novel and was introduced to Anna, the teenager who was essentially conceived so that her sister, Kate, who has been diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, can live, I thought I'd made up my mind right away.  Surprisingly, that all changed throughout the twists and turns of the story. <br /> <br />One of the joys of this novel was the fact that the story unfolded through the viewpoints of the main characters.  In this manner, we really get to know -- and, in most cases, empathize with -- each of them.  The weakest character is Sara, Anna and Kate's mother.  This is unfortunate, as Sara really ought to have been perhaps the most sympathetic character. <br /> <br />Each of these characters (with the exception of Sara, until rather late in the story)was a delight to know.  Getting into their lives, and being taken into their confidences, was a treat.  And Ms. Picoult's skillful writing allowed each character to speak in a distinct and appropriate voice (again, with one exception -- this time, Anna, whose voice at times, but only at times, sounded a bit more mature than the typical 13 year-old, but I will concede that Anna is not a typical 13 year-old). <br /> <br />By the novel's end, I was surprised to find myself truly moved by the conclusion and the fates of all the characters.  While perhaps Ms. Picoult took an easy way out with the ending, and while perhaps other readers and I might have wished for a different outcome, it worked well. <br /> <br />\\"My Sister's Keeper\\" was an interesting, compelling read, and really shows us that there are no easy solutions to difficult choices, and illustrates the many facets of parents' love for their children.
B0006SSOHM|3.0|I really didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie.  People tried to explain it to me, but they couldn't really convey in normal conversation the true twisted plot of this movie. <br /> <br />Two guys are chained in a disgusting bathroom together, and they have to crack clues and solve some pretty twisted puzzles to prove that they want to stay alive.  Supposedly these guys don't know each other...or do they? <br /> <br />During the movie, you may THINK you have it figured out.  I don't know if the writers make it seem incredibly predictable on purpose...or if it kind of just happened.  It's hard to tell.  Once I DID think that I had it figured out...I thought that would either be a really incredible plot twist or a SMASHING surprise ending. <br /> <br />The movie doesn't really satisfy in that way.  There is a plot twist and a surprise ending, but it's only mildy entertaining. What I did like about this movie was the incredibly twisted and wierd mind of this serial killer...and the stomach churning gory scenes.  It truly entertains for the \\"Seven\\" lovers in us. <br /> <br />For a low-budge movie, Saw isn't half bad.  There ARE better movies for those of us that enjoy this kind of thing, but it's worth giving Saw a watch if even for the sh-t's and giggles.

B0000027RL|5.0|When I first walked into my local music store some 5 years back I didn't know what I was gonna buy. The shelves and shelves of music albums and some highlighted. \\"Ten\\" was highlighted and something appraising as far as record sales go was written about it. I thought to myself this might be a commercial favourite and no way Im buying this.A day later I saw the video of Jeremy on tv.After buying the disc the very same day, I gave it moderate listens at first.<br /><br />\\"Garden\\" is what I would repeatedly listen to it at first. I would say its the most mesmerising of all tracks and also the most easy to fall into. \\"Jeremy\\" is something I would headbang too.It grew into a song I would look back and respect Pearl Jam for. Its something that influenced an entire genre of music that touched our minds in the early 90's.I would actually go as far as saying \\"Jeremy\\" reigns as the most influencial song of the Nineties.<br /><br />\\"Even Flow\\" is so slick and smooth and its amazing how somethings never change and Even Flow with its absolute precision in conveying meaning to words to melody is just outstanding.Eddie Vedder somehow influenced millions of people via this album. You can hate him , beat his image or try to ambush any praise directed towards his footpaths but you can't deny the guy changed what we hear in music.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Release\\", \\"Deep\\" & \\"Ocean\\" reminds me of the sea and induce a spirit of freedom of thought and that of spirit in them.<br /><br />If asked or when asked or when I will be asked what's the best song I have ever heard in my life. I'll reply \\"Black\\" without blinking simply because its a dark melody of letting go of one's heart. Its a love song and that shouldnt make it sound that can change or influence not only one's mood in the 5 minutes of its playing but can cause oblivious heartache in  a way of its own.<br />It commands respect with lyrics that touch your soul. Its not a soulcrusher but simply the truth.

0385486804|5.0|The author does a marvelous job showing us a man's life by retracing his mysterious footsteps _ from the desert where he burned his car and rafted to the pacific _ the Alaskan outback. <br /> <br />The authors details are authentic and well placed and timed. <br /> <br />This is Krakauer's best work, although Into Thin Air is more exciting.
B000002513|5.0|If you are into the classic Springsteen sound (Born In The USA), this album will really catch you off guard.  This album is heavily instrumented, and is a great reflection on city life and city sound.  Even though this album features Rosalita as its biggest hit, which is played out by now, some of the other songs on this album are classic.  Incident on 57th Street is amazing, the instrumentation and story are some of Springsteen's best work.  4th of July Asbury Park (Sandy) is a great look at leaving his \\"greaser\\" days behind for the changing scene.  New York City Serenade is the best introduction to any song in his career maybe exluding 10th Avenue Freezeout and Spirit In the Night--the last couple minutes of the song kind of fade away but it's a classic.    This album is a classic because you can really feel the raw emotion of this album.  It is a lot less polished than his later albums as far as having more precise rhythms, lyrics, and sounds, but that is what makes it a classic--it's just raw energy that sounds like jam sessions at some points.
B0002OERI0|4.0|This is the first cd I could not import to my MP3 Player. Kind of a bummer. They made some of the songs transfer for 15 hours or more. I guess they need the money. But there has to be a better way.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I'll put it simply: this is one of those albums that you listen to again and again, never skipping a single track, and getting more out of it every time. It is very different from Mer De Noms, being more of a concept album, but equally good, if not better. There's not a single track I don't like, and while I prefer some to others, they are all part of a cohesive whole that has a shape and purpose that is mind-blowing. Lyrics are stellar, wrenching and not overly-angsty, and the songwriting can alternately wash over you or tear you to pieces. Both fierce and deep, this is definitely a keeper.
B00006RU5B|4.0|It's needlesss to introduce each of the band members because others did for me maybe too many times. I am a huge fan of RATM. Combining de la Rocha's political anger with Morello's never before heard guitar mastery, with the support of drummer Wilk and basist Timmy C; the band created a sound that could not and never will be imitated. <br /> <br />   I don't know much abou the Soungarden, I only heard Superunknown, but Audioslave got the best member :D. <br />Last couple of years have brought several \\"superbands\\" formed by former members that can be considered legends by now (yes, I am thinking of Velvet Rrevolver). While in VR's case they din't have to bother at all (how many times has it happened that you listened to entire album several times in a row and yet can't remember a single melody?), Audioslave was far more succesful in giving us songs that are to be remembered. <br /> <br />   While Cornell had little too much influence over the ex-RATM, their first release is definetly worth the time, especially the track Show Me How To Live. They let loose on that one (although it is a bit overplayed on radios). I really look forward to their second album.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Well, I'm only beginning to discover David Bowie (shame on me, I know), but from my experience, this is a wonderful beginners album. Accessible while also experimental and wonderfully quirky, this is one Bowie album that I love going back to as I discover more of his stuff. The songwriting is compelling and driven, and the album moves gracefully as a whole. I'd recommend it highly to anyone who is starting their Bowie collection, and anyone else just cruising around.
0743454537|4.0|IMAGINE THIS SCENARIO:<br /><br />1. Having a child with a severe disease which WILL kill her and soon..<br /><br />  UNLESS<br /><br />2. Another child is conceived (within the same family) which can contribute blood and bone marrow to keep her alive. The parents go ahead and have that child, solely to keep their other child alive (yes, this situation is ripped from actual events of recent years, but still made compelling in this author's hands).<br /><br />  NOW IMAGINE:<br /><br />3. The donor child, in spite of her great love for her sister, wants to stop giving pieces of herself away, for reasons that become clear only later on. She hires a lawyer to fight for her interests.<br /><br />  This is when the novel takes off, racheting up the tension notch by notch. There is a catch in the whole story, a plot twist that isn't revealed until the last few days of court testimony, one that blew me away and moved me to tears.<br /><br />  And then...the author decides to throw in a final, added twist which is just too far beyond coincidence to be believable. It will be reassuring, perhaps, to those who believe \\"everything happens for a reason\\". Other readers may feel let down.<br /><br />  Even with the disappointing ending, I could not get the dilemna presented in this book out of my mind. It haunted me and the \\"what ifs?\\" reverberated in my mind for days. For that reason alone, I'd recommend this book. I just wish the author had opted not to chose the particular ending she did. I'd rather the conclusion wasn't quite so pat.
B00064MW6A|2.0|First, it is important to know that the main character in \\"Catwoman\\" is different from the character in the comic book and in the movie \\"Batman Returns\\".  The main difference is that in \\"Catwoman\\", she has superhuman strength, speed and agility (which is well shown by the computer imaging).  This is not necessarily a strength or a weakness, but depends on your expectations.  If, for example, you are a fan of the comic, you will likely be disappointed.   <br /> <br />Now, for the strengths.  They include some engaging action, some suspense as you follow the main character's uncovering of the bad guy's plot, interesting computer generated imaging of Catwoman's moves, Berry's impressive presentation in her leather costume, and some exploration of the inner conflict between Berry's personas of Patience Phillips and Catwoman.   <br /> <br />The movie's weaknesses include an uninspired script, over-use of computer imaging, and silly scenes of Berry acting cat-like (although some of these scenes were cute, most of them did not work, so broke up the flow of the film).  <br /> <br />There was potential to make this a very interesting movie by expanding on the psychological issues presented in the contrasting aspects of feminity represented by the main character.  In the comic book, Catwoman represents an empowering figure for women.  She also embodies the conflict between the desire to be sexy and powerful and social and internalized pressures to be meek and obedient.  Exploring these mythic and psychological aspect of the character would not have taken away from the action and would have made \\"Catwoman\\" a great movie, offering entertainment at different levels.  Unfortunately, the movie failed at this, and ended up mediocre.   <br /> <br />In summary, \\"Catwoman\\" has some good aspects and some bad aspects.  Like any movie, how much you enjoy it depends on things like your expectations, the mood you are in, and your movie preferences.   If you do not expect too much and wantto see some action with a mild to moderate amount of character development, then you will enjoy the movie.  If you get hung up on the dry script, lack of depth, exaggerated effects, and unfulfilled potential then you probably will not like the movie.
0671027344|5.0|This is, by far, the book that has spoken to me the most of any I have ever read- and I read a lot.  I'm an English teacher (9th grade), and originally read this in college to preview it for a YA Lit class... and have since read it another 5-6 times (at least).  No, it isn't a flowery piece of classic literature, but anyone who has graduated from high school, or anyone younger who has had a hard life, can truly appreciate this book.  I am not allowed to teach it in my classroom, even for upperclassmen, but would love to do so because Charlie's journey into self-awareness is stellar and poignant.  It begins a little jumpy, but with good reason (Charlie is still figuring out the mechanics of good writing as he is only a freshman in high school).  Almost every \\"minor\\" detail in the book backs up Chbosky's point that Charlie does not truly know himself well enough to BE himself. <br />A couple of side notes: my freshmen usually enjoy the book, but can't often identify with it and usually misunderstand the ending (they think Charlie OD's???).  I think that most of them just haven't had enough experience in life to appreciate the book.   <br />Anyone 11+ would probably enjoy it, but I would recommend 16+ to really \\"get it.\\"  One final thing: conservative parents beware... this book touches on every possible issue that teenagers face, so of course it has some controversial points in it.  I know quite a few parents still don't want their children exposed to anything like that if they can help it, so be aware.  That said, this book is truly honest portrayal of high school and I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone, and have.  All of my closest friends, my teaching colleagues, and even my own parents have read it & loved it as well.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is by far one of the best concert DVD's i've ever seen. Plus it has all of the music videos plus a rare track of Purity. Joey's Drum solo was flawless. And the sound quality is amazing. <br />It has many different camera angles so you can watch witch ever member you like best. Plus the behind the scenes clips are great. You get to see the band putting on thier masks and even practicing before the show. Plus the songs they play are from there two best cd's, IOWA and SLIPKNOT including (SIC) People=$#&% and heretic anthem. Don't waste your money on the other slipknot DVD's. <br />Buy this one it's really worth it.
0790729628|5.0|I liked the theatrical release immensely, and enjoy the director's cut equally. The letterbox format recreates the visual experience in theatres, and the lack of Ford's narrative puts the focus on the rich scenery created by Scott. I still see something new with each viewing. Best is the unicorn segment, highly symbolic and open to wide interpretations. Blade Runner fans ought to have both versions.
076780421X|5.0|Fools Rush In is one of my top five favorite movies of all time. Of course Matthew Perry is known for his role on Friends but he became one of my favorite actors when I saw this movie. It really shows that he can play outside of the sitcom world on to the big screen.  <br />Matthew Perry builds night clubs and is transfered to Las Vegas to build one, later on to come back to New York. As he gets there he meets Salma and they have a one night stand. She leaves him in the middle of the night just to return a couple of months later to surprise him, this is where the humorous love story begins. <br />This movie is great for both sexes, the romance between two different types of people is very entertaining and the writers added some classic lines.  <br />Overall I give this movie 5 stars, all the actors played great roles and the movie couldn't have been better. Never a dull moment! <br />
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a child and was greatly looking forward to its new release on DVD.  I was especially looking forward to the addition of those scenes cut from the originally English dubbing and the corrected storyline, and was not at all disappointed in them. In fact they were exactly what the original release needed and should never have been cut in the first place. <br />However except for the voice acting by Patrick Stewart, the English dubbing is far from superb.  Naussica and others come across as dry and unfeeling in the film compared to that of their original counterparts.  Whether this is due to the actors themselves or translation issues from the original I don't know, I am even willing to chalk it up to my nostalgic remembrance of the original voice work. <br />Either way I definitely recommend this movie for any home library. <br />Overall I give this new release 7.5 out of 10.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album needs to be listened to more than once to really appreciate it.Some of the reviewers say the lyrics are poorly written; compared with todays music please!The music on this album sounds new and refreshing.U2 really did a good job with the melding of the music with the lyrics.Most of the albums today have maybe two or three songs you can listen to but this album really is great from start to finish.U2 is still by far the best band making new music.
B00005YW4H|1.0|This kind of singing might be acceptable in the lounge of a third-rate Vegas hotel, but what all the hype is about is certainly beyond me. When Jones tries for intimacy, she mostly provides breathy gook; when she goes for volume, she's just strident. She is in tune most of the time, but that's little compensation for what's on this disc. Can a duets disc with Josh Groban be far behind?
B00009XITP|1.0|What the filmmakers of \\"What A Girl Wants\\" evidently didn't learn is that there's a big difference between being the star of an obscure Nickelodeon show (\\"The Amanda Show\\") and being the star of a 30 million dollar Hollywood teen romantic comedy. Whatever Amanda Byrnes is selling, I ain't buying. This movie, based upon the play \\"The Reluctant Debutante\\" follows our intrepid young star in her journey to meet her father, a stuffy British aristocrat, played with Bumbling Stammering Hugh Grantish perfection by Colin Firth, who's really better than the part written for him here. Byrnes and the filmmakers seem to think that staring vacantly, smiling, trying on hats and sunglasses, and dancing around to generic pop music passes for characterization these days. Wrong. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy; sweet, lacking nutrition and just plain bad for you. To top it all off the DVD itself is a wreck. The sound dubbing is poorly timed, and gives the impression that the actors were in a tunnel and the uninspired songs dart in and out of the left and right channels, go mute (actually a saving grace) and just generally detract from the whole mess. If you're looking for a movie that gives young women a powerful, strong, independent role model, rent and watch young Keisha Castle-Hughes' performance in \\"Whale Rider\\", my sure bet to be an Oscar nominee for Best Drama.
B00004TH83|1.0|Does the world really need another Celine Dion sound-alike?    I guess we're just going to have to go through an extended period of having to tolerate these brash ego-centric wailing divas that think they have more to offer than anyone else, when in reality, their artistry and musicianship is sadly lacking or non-existent altogether.     OK, sure, they can hold long-notes and wail darn near as loud as your local Civil Defense air raid siren but what about things like detail, nuance, interpretation, pacing, variety, tone and ACTUAL TALENT and such? In this world of instant-stardom at any cost, those things have pretty much been dismissed as unimportant. Sadly, this is just another one of hundreds of examples of flashy trappings winning out over substance. To add insult to injury, the songs themselves are nothing more than assembly-line sub-Dianne Warren sugar-coated schlock guaranteed to induce vomiting or a diabetic coma at 500 yards!     Stuff like this plays big on American Idol and such, but in the end, it doesn't amount to jack!     Sorry Lara, the air raid siren wins this round.
B00008EYA5|1.0|Boom! Crash! Bang! Boom! Rat-a-tat-a-tat! There - I've just summed up S.W.A.T. for you. Starring Samuel L. Jackson (the second coolest black man in Hollywood) and Naughty Boy of The Moment, Colin Farrell, this run of the mill police shoot 'em up is average. And by average I mean that when something is supposed to go boom, it does. There's little to no ingenuity, little to no originality, heck, they even brought the catchy S.W.A.T. theme back (updated of course). The good guys are cool, the bad guys are bad, and that's about the size of it. The one thing that really bothered me was seeing the wonderful Michelle Rodriguez co-starring as the stereotypical Tough Latina Girl (tm). After a wonderful screen debut in \\"Girlfight\\" (go rent it now!), she has yet to star in anything resembling good since then. \\"Resident Evil\\", \\"The Fast and the Furious\\", \\"Blue Crush\\". In every single one, she's Tough Latina Girl, and that's just a shame. It was also a treat to see Jeremy Renner as the S.W.A.T. cop gone bad, as I'd seen him audition and get the role in Bravo TV's \\"The IT Factor\\" a year earlier. So the bottom line is - if you're looking for a good film, then try elsewhere. If you're looking for something to stare at on your television screen for an hour or two, without any danger of thought or emotion, then S.W.A.T. will do just fine, but if you like your police work with character and emotion, go rent \\"Homicide\\" directed by David Mamet.
B00006RINF|4.0|yes they are better than evanessence(not to take anything from them though) lacuna is verry dark moody and melodic,even none rock fans can get into this.however it is unfortunate that they got overshadowed by the latter.but thats the way the industry work.i got pissed when nelly got big and people over looked bone thugs-n-harmony whom did the same thing he did but only better,and gave it a darker edged.thats just the nature of the beast<br /><br />anyways i don't have a favorite track as i like the whole album.but if i must i guess i'l pick swampped,and heavens a lie.that would be the obvious choices.
B00000DRDW|4.0|Detroit music in the 1960's and early 1970's was more than just Motown.  The area also produced cult favorites and proto-heavy rockers like The Stooges and the MC5.  Unless you're from Detroit, however, you may be unaware that Detroiter Bob Seger released a series of albums before he arrived on the national stage in the mid-1970's with break-out hits such as 'Night Moves\\" and 'Beautiful Loser'.  In fact, for quite a few years, both Seger and his fans bemoaned the lack of national attention his work received.  Looking back on some of his work reveals why his local fans were perplexed at his delayed ascent, and also why a national audience eluded Seger. <br /> <br />'Smokin' O.P.'s' (meaning smoking other people's... in this case other people's hits rather than cigarettes, although the front insert is a wonderfully simplistic play on a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes) is a great collection of cover songs.  In his early incarnations Seger sounded much more like the sharp-edged J. Geils Band (who first gained acclaim with their 'Full House' LP, recorded at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit) than the more middle-of-the-road rocker he became in the mid-'70's.  'Smokin' O.P.'s' was Bob's fifth album, released in 1972, and for the most part was a collection of excellent cover songs.  Most are standard hard-rock offerings (the sound that went down best in local Detroit venues) including an impressive opening trio of Ellis McDaniel's 'Bo Diddley/Who Do You Love', Stephen Stills' 'Love the One You're With', and Tim Hardin's 'If I Were a Carpenter'.  The first two songs feature slick lead guitar solo's from Monk Bruce, while 'If I Were a Carpenter' owes it's foundation and some great solo work to organist Skip Knape (aka 'Van Winkle' from 'Teegarden & Van Winkle'; David Teegarden provides percussion on this disc as well).  <br /> <br />On the original vinyl release side one mellowed out a bit at the end with a cover of Leon Russell's 'Hummin' Bird' (\\"don't fly away\\").  Seger is really showing some grit by covering these four classic hits, and while it's hard to say that any of them surpass the original versions, they are sung with an obvious joy and excitement that make them a thrill to experience.  It's probably the best single album side Seger put together before his more acclaimed persona emerged. <br /> <br />The remaining five tracks offer a couple gems as well.  Seger offers a sweet version of 'Turn On Your Love Light', feeding off a funky rhythm guitar foundation, and the closer, a remake of Seger's 1966 hit with The Heard, 'Heavy Music'.  'Heavy Music' seems misplaced on the disc, as does it's predecessor, 'Someday'.  Both are Seger compositions (which doesn't fit with the theme of the album), 'Someday' is a misfit as a quiet, piano-based ballad, and 'Heavy Music' would serve much better as an opener than the closer.  'Let It Rock', the opener of side two, comes across as a generic bar-hall stomper, and 'Jesse James', while less distinguished than some of the other tracks, has a beat like a churning locomotive that blends in well with the albums other tracks. <br /> <br />While there's a lot to like on 'Smokin' O.P.'s' including some excellent musicianship, quality composing ('Heavy Music'), and an audibly resounding desire to deliver \\"the goods\\", clearly Seger needed to develop more consistency, and broaden his range of music to become an elite performer, a mystery he solved as the '70's progressed.  It's a shame that Bob has not seen fit to reissue some of his earlier work, such as this disc, his original 'Bob Seger System' album, as well as 'Noah' and 'Mongrel'.  On a smaller scale, for fans of Seger, not having access to these tracks is akin to only experiencing The Beatles from 'Rubber Soul' on.  While these discs may not reveal the mature talent Seger would eventually develop, their raw energy and gritty late 60's/early 70's sound has its own vintage appeal.  If you release them, Bob, the fans will come.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Ebert, in his review, was kind to this dull, squalid, pitiful 'movie,' which at best reminded me of a bad reality TV show.  There's not a single likable character in Napoleon Dynamite to be found, however, if you like dwarf tossing you might 'enjoy' this unimaginative gob of drek. <br /> <br />After having read the panyegric online reviews, I watched this (thankfully rented) indie 'movie' through to the bitter finale.  The main characters are the kind of geeks that even nerds and other losers can't stand.  Ever wondered why a pack of dogs will kill one of their own; after watching Napoleon Dynamite, you won't wonder again... <br /> <br />Then, after a long boring hour establishing the absolute nadir of these geeks' lives in excruciating detail, the movie gets stupid.  The ending absolutley destroys whatever cinema verite it previously and painfully established.  One geek' meets his penpal hottie who then magically (I asume) turns this pitiful wretch into a hip-hop dude!  Oh yeah, that's believable; only to someone who still watches Saturday morning cartoons, cereal commercials for fun and American Idol... <br /> <br />If that isn't unbelievable enough, Napoleon (who can't scale a fence without falling on his face) then -- after watching some lame dance video -- turns into a nerdy Michael Jackson...  Sigh.   <br /> <br />This isn't a movie; it's a train wreck.  0 stars.  Avoid if at all possible, even at the expense of offending your significant other.   <br /> <br />

0743244257|2.0|I bought this book while on vacation in Italy - it was the only novel in English by a literary type author in the bookstore. I knew De Lillo was supposed to be a great author and so I bought it. Also, I am interested in reading about financial figures like George Soros or Warren Buffet.  <br /> <br />The book reminds me of the movie Apocalypse Now which starts wonderfully with great cinematography and eventually descends into craziness and nonsense IMHO. This book starts well with a high concept  and great writing style and then gradually descends into implausibility, nonsense etc. The financial transactions didn't seem very plausible to me and the motivation didn't make sense any more and the events at the end of the day involved far too much coincidence to be plausible. <br /> <br />Unless of course the latter parts of the day are all meant to be some psychotic episode.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This is my favourite Pantera-album. Phil Anselmo actually really sings(and not just shouts as if haunted by the devil like on later efforts), Dimebag (R.I.P.) plays cool solos and crunching riffs and by far all of the neckbreakers on \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" are hits. Just listen to the brain-smashing opener or \\"Cemetary Gates\\", and you will know why this disc is a classic in the metal genre. 5 stars for one of thrash metal's finest recordings.
B0006U4UAU|4.0|LCD Soundsystem, aka, James Murphy, is currently the frontrunner for album of 2005, and although his self-titled doesn't fall short on musical vision, whether it sets-out to revolutionize music remains to be seen. LCD Soundsystem combines the minimalistic beats of 70's dance-music with post-punk grooves. Other than the rock-electronica of 'Movement' and the Dear Prudence-like 'Never As Tired As When I'm Waking Up', the entire album is an infectious trashy dance work-out, stripping-down musical rhythm to it's most primal level. As Murphy does his best Mark E Smith impression, each song essentially revolves around a series of repeating notes, overdubbed with quirky disco samples, Krautrock noodling, overseen by the adept touch of a turntablist virtuoso. LCD Soundsystem's blend of salacious beats, convulsive rhythms, and rockstar defiance is a breath of fresh air, and when all is said and done, this will most likely rank as one of the strongest albums of the year.
B000002JOH|5.0|Although my favourite Pantera-album is \\"Cowboys from Hell\\" I really like \\"Vulgar Display...\\"almost equally. One Smash-Hit follows the last and you can throw in this great disc and rock your head off! This album is a must-have and it shows (again) what a great guitar-player Dimebag was (R.I.P.)!

B0006213WG|4.0|Half Hour of Power was an ok CD, and All Killer No Filler I thought was a incredibly horrible cd.  But when Does this look Infected came out I was very impressed.  This CD continues on with what Does This Look Infected was.  It's Pop/Rock/Punk/Metal.  It's a pretty entertaining CD with lots of good guitar riffs and solos.  I was very impressed.  The only bad thing about it is that you can only listen to it so many times before it becomes annoying.  But if you want a hard rocking album this is definantly one to get.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I believe that Linkin Park has done well with themselves. Let's face it. Their first ablum, Hybrid Theory, sold millions of copies and put them on the map. Their use of vocals and guitar and a dj table are great. Then comin out with Reanimation was a big success. Making a remix of almost every song on hybrid theory is what i loved the most. I especially loved the new \\"crawling\\" song on reanimation. But by far the best album out there now is Meteora. They have not done remixes of past songs but actually have made a new album. Their newest songs, somewhere i belong and numb, have made the billboard top 10. Linkin Park is so great to listen to because unlike other albums, you can pop the disc in and listen to the whole album because there isnt a song taht is bad on the whole cd. I love how they mix their sounds together and how they have a strong voice compared with a lighter voice. Great Work!
B000002UAU|5.0|Ok first im no baby boomer and have a wide variety of music interests from the beatles,kinks through to xtc,radiohead and bowie and almost everything in between. And out of all that this album stands alone as the best album ever imho. the production is peerless and the songs uniformly excellent from the rocking titular track to the circus like mr kite to the lsd haze of lucy,everything gels perfectly on this album. sgt pepper is the eqivalent of mozart in our own age,even mccartney said they were making todays classical music. highly recommended for those interested in hearing the greatest group of all time at their absolute peak.
B0002OERI0|4.0|These guys have gotten a lot better since their last albums, which were a little too &quot;pop&quot; for me. This album on the other hand is pretty catchy. Everyone has (or should have) heard &quot;American Idiot&quot; and &quot;Boulavard of Broken Dreams&quot; before (they're constantly playing the music videos on MTV). But it's the massive 9-10 minute song &quot;Jesus of Suburbia&quot; that impresses me the most. Although it's not the best track, it manages to keep you entertained for the whole 9-10 minutes... not something a lot of bands can do. All in all this is a pertty damn good album, it's a little too slow for my taste, but still very good. Green Day fans should love this album!
0142000663|1.0|I am a Junior in High School and am instinctually drawn to literature.  This novel was a required reading, but that didn't spoil the story for me.  The story did that itself.  I have never been so bored in my life.  Honestly, I'm astounded to find that so many people \\"loved\\" this book.  While the story did have a great moral to go along with it, it was about dirt!  Dirt and migrating.  Dirt and migrating and more dirt.  I couldn't even sit down to read it for more than 15 minutes before dozing off.  What an awful summer read.  I even think I chucked it out the balcony once.  But please, decide for yourself.  Opinions on literature are very diverse, so make your own, and make sure not to operate heavy machinery while reading this one.  Things could get drowsy.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|Often during the sequels to movies most are disppointed. With the exception of a less than great plot--tHE HIGHWAY SPEEDCHASE ARE WORTH THE PRICE ALON!!! I've always liked the spectacular, esp in highway chase scenes. This by itself makes the movie worth getting [about 30 min chase seen with outta this world effects].<br /><br />Anything extra the film uses in fx is just a special added bonus. Overall the storyline of the first Matrix was good; here you get less plot but bigger bang for your buck,,,just watch the chase scene...you know you want to<br /><br />When I worked as a medic I woulda tripped for an ambulance run with this much adrenaline!
B0007OCG4W|2.0|A storyteller does not introduce a gun early in a plot unless some character will use the gun later. In \\"Closer,\\" the two men have cyber-sex, and by the film's climax fail to go into the actual physical act. This is a stag-fest, yes, but it is not about the women who are little more than pawns used by one man to attract/repel/attract the other. Finally, when Clive Owen tops Jude Law in the dermotology office, the encounter is a reduction to language and not the action that the men's opening engagement should lead to. This is a tale of how one man Tops another--minus the courage to show it in a post-gay world. Anyone familiar with D. H. Lawrence knows where this story is going. Think of the famous last line in the Ken Russell film \\"Women in Love.\\" The wife asks: \\"Aren't I enough for you?\\"
B00000K19E|5.0|Matrix and Revisited are spectacular special fx. You won't be disappointed.  This is edge of your seat spectacular. The plot is good, too. I've watched this multiple times. I liked the way Hollywood producers--the Wachowski brothers--went to great lengths of working out the effects with the best of comic makers--Anime.<br /><br />Loved this movie and the first sequel I gave them as gifts to various family members. None were disappointed. Highly recommended
B00005JM2I|2.0|The adaption of the Fountainhead into film is a futile attempt worstened only by misfit acting. Ayn Rand is noted for presenting characters as they should be and not as they are. Her characters are heroic in a way that can never be imitated nor brought to life by way of acting. Gary Cooper is awful as Howard Roark. His discomfort with the script is clearly evident, he lacks subltelty and the emotion needed for a character of larger than life proportion, let alone depicting a man who defies the world to uphold his values. Patricia Neal is guilty of overt over-acting, she is unworthy of Dominic Francone's character and is impossible to be held in anything other than derision. The Fountainhead should never have been made into a movie it serves only to demean an extroadinary work. The actors are weakened by a dialogue which they can't portray, words that are meant to depict power and intrasigent ideals are delivered in a laughable manner. Personally, I wish I had never seen this movie so that I can forget the mockery it has made of a seminal novel. Not a single actor is worthy of recognition because they can't live up to their larger than life depictions. The cinematography is, however, noteworthy. The sets were created intelligently and artistically. Architecture is given enough emphasis to keep the viewer from ending the movie if only to see the next shot, the next erection (literally as phallic buildings are in constant use) of a premier cantilivered construction endeavouring to emulate the works of Frank Loyd Wright. The purpose of The Fountainhead was to let loose Ayn Rands Objectivist Philosophy and was done brilliantly in the book. The appeal lie in the spirit of her words and thoughts delivered by proxy through characters which are so grandiose, so sublime that no amount of acting could possibly do them justice. Her words are capable of penetrating one's deepest feelings, prompting otherwise static emotions, a revolution in one's mind. Comparably the movie is comedic, prompting those very feelings of pity that Ayn Rand would be ashamed to have her readers feel.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Not worth it. I was hugely disappointed esp after the great fx of the 1st 2 of the Matrix trilogy. It seemed that about the only consistent fx was the machines taking over man. This is a tired them and also to continue using the same effect over or to digitally rematch it over and over gets tiring. Of course one interesting multiple effects was the many Mr. Smiths getting created just like a true virus. Unless you're a Matrix collector--I'd just as soon watch a rental or borrow rather than purchase unless for a low price.<br /><br />The 1st 2 Matrix movies I've watched many times...this 3rd of the trilogy has been watched only once--for a reason
0553573403|4.0|Before you read this review, a warning. I've read all the published books from the Song of Ice and Fire series in short spans of time, so the review might not refer strictly to the first book, although I'll try to keep it there.<br /><br />First of all, this is not classic fantasy. This is not heroic fantasy at all, this is not dark fantasy, altough that term comes closer. Actually, a good question would be whether it is fantasy at all. I'd say Martin makes a pretty instrumental use of the fantasy genre - he's not telling a fantasy tale, he's using fantasy to tell a tale. What kind of tale, you might ask?<br /><br />Well, that's where the problem comes in. Instead of telling one single tale, Martin uses a trick used sometimes in the movie industry and shows us pieces of the bigger cake from multiple characters' perspective. This form of narration causes the plot to become less important, with the perceptions on the world becoming the more important part of the book.<br /><br />That's where the key strength of this book (and of the series) lies within - Martin's ability to capture various mechanisms of politics and intrigue viewed by different people, with different amounts of life experience (Martin often uses children's views to better show the unraveling of the intricate machinations of politics and court life), different moralities (many characters in the book whose points of view we're given cannot be actually described as being \\"good\\" in the usual sense of the word) and different goals (the world is shown both from the perspective of high-ranked lords as well as their subjects). He does a really impressive job with it, managing to achieve a great degree of reality, which, taking into account the diversity I just mentioned, is indeed a wondrous task. His characters look very lifelike, not the cardboard fantasy heroes of traditional heroic fantasy, but people like the ones we meet in our everyday life, just thrown into the fantasy mix.<br /><br />The layers of intrigue and the plot complication would make Robert Jordan envious. It is quite an intellectual challenge to follow all the twists and turns of the plot and capture the connection between some apparently unconnected places and events. However, this is also the reason I give the book 4 stars instead of 5. Regardless of how much I appreciate Martin's literate talents, I really like to feel that the action is leading me somewhere. I sometimes don't feel that way when reading A Game of Thrones. The reference to Robert Jordan is not without reason. I am really afraid that Martin will become so entangled in the intricacies of the plot he won't be able to untangle it properly. It takes an even increasing amount of skill to handle this much parallel plotlines properly, and an author's abilities go only so far, as Robert Jordan's readers have probably started to find out.<br /><br />Well, that's it for an evaluation of Martin's style. What about the book content itself? An important note - Martin's writing is what I'd consider \\"adult fantasy\\". Sex and violence is omnipresent and sometimes intertwined, so this is certainly no book for a reader less than 16 or even 18 years old. It was a very enjoyable read for me, but if you expect fast \\"RPG style\\" character progression, a favorite character to easily identify yourself with and a smooth read with no intellectual involvement, then this book is probably not meant for you. On the other hand, if you like fantasy but you've gotten bored of cliched, \\"hero kills the dragon and rescues the maiden\\" stories, this one is certainly a must-read. The choice is yours.ers of intrigue and the plot complication would make Robert Jordan envious.

B00024I2Z4|5.0|The Disney version of Mulan is a very precious addition to anyone's Disney collection.  In this masterpiece, a young woman by the name of Mulan feels uncomfortably pressured to be the traditional perfect bride and daughter of her time and culture in China.  But unknown to everyone who knows and sees her, she has much different and untraditional plans for herself.  When the Hun Army invades China, one man from every family is called to serve in the country's defense.  When her previously injured father is called to serve, Mulan seizes the opportunity for adventure and honor and takes his place.  Tagging along with her is ex-guardian Mushu, a tiny scrawny dragon willing to put her life in danger to regain his position of exalted guardianship, her lucky cricket, and her trusted anti-Mushu horse Khan.  Together they embark on a remarkable journey so save China and, perhaps, herself.  Will she succeed?  Will she be discovered by her commanding officer?  And will Mushu ever regain his position? <br /> <br />Mulan is played by the talented and spirited Ming Nga (sp?) and Mushu by the hilarious and gifted Eddie Murphy.  It is a worthwhile addition to any collection.  Songs include \\"Honor to us all\\" and the hilarious and inspiring \\"Be a Man\\" sequence. <br /> <br />Personally, my favorite character in the movie was the cricket, and I loved the never ending Mushu/Khan feud. <br /> <br />
B000000OSE|5.0|I love this album. November Rain & Live and Let Die are my 2 <br />favorite songs on this album. This album is as great as Appetite <br />for Destruction. The riff in November Rain is great, typically <br />my heavy metal style.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|...That's what I thought when I first saw the video for \\"Hysteria\\" on cable at my brother's house.  As soon as I saw guys standing around with guitars, I prepared myself mentally for more of the mindless, nerve-grating tripe that people are calling \\"emo\\".  It took a few minutes to sink in that what I was experiencing was actually a quasi-complicated song that a chimpanzee could not, in fact, play.  This was not \\"emo\\" at all!  Repeated listenings to \\"Hysteria\\" as the only decent thing on rock radio moved me to buy the album.  Imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to find \\"Our Time is Running Out\\" was also on there.  Another diamond in the rough that we call \\"modern rock radio\\".  But enough emo-bashing. <br />     Absolution is an incredible CD.  It has the feeling of enormity and importance that accompany records like Tools \\"Aenima\\" and Jane' Addiction's \\"Ritual De Lo Habitual\\".  The comparisons with Radiohead are inevitable due to the singer's voice and style - but I can say that Muse does a lot more for me in terms of the impact and resonance of the MUSIC than Radiohead ever did.  (And I liked \\"OK Computer\\" as much as the next guy - I swear).  I capitalized the word \\"music\\" because it would be unfair to put Muse head and shoulders above Radiohead in all departments.  Radiohead's lyrics seem a little fresher and more thought-provoking than those on \\"Absolution\\".  That said - Muse's singer may be imitating Thom Yorke, but he actually sounds better than the Radiohead front-man (even if his lyrics aren't quite as insightful).   <br />    In terms of the sound of this record, the best I can do is tell you to add Radiohead to Tool, and then divide by two. That should get you in the right ballpark.  There are plenty of hard rockers on here, and even the more mellow songs usually wind up with the distortion somewhere around \\"11\\" during the chorus.  But it all works out for the best.  It's also fairly cohesive, though it can also be listened to track for track.  Is this record a bit pretentious/melodramatic at times?  Hell yes it is.  But not every band we listen to has to be comically self-aware.  Sometimes it's fun to take yourself (and life) seriously, and this is a great record to listen to while doing it.  Highly recommended to anyone who thinks that rock and roll might be dead.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Give 'Em Enough Rope, for all of its many attributes, was essentially a holding pattern for the Clash, but the double-album London Calling is a remarkable leap forward, incorporating the punk aesthetic into rock & roll mythology and roots music. Before, the Clash had experimented with reggae, but that was no preparation for the dizzying array of styles on London Calling. There's punk and reggae, but there's also rockabilly, ska, New Orleans R&B, pop, lounge jazz, and hard rock; and while the record isn't tied together by a specific theme, its eclecticism and anthemic punk function as a rallying call. While many of the songs -- particularly \\"London Calling,\\" \\"Spanish Bombs,\\" and \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" -- are explicitly political, by acknowledging no boundaries the music itself is political and revolutionary. But it is also invigorating, rocking harder and with more purpose than most albums, let alone double albums. Over the course of the record, Joe Strummer and Mick Jones explore their familiar themes of working-class rebellion and antiestablishment rants, but they also tie them in to old rock & roll traditions and myths, whether it's rockabilly greasers or \\"Stagger Lee,\\" as well as mavericks like doomed actor Montgomery Clift. The result is a stunning statement of purpose and one of the greatest rock & roll albums ever recorded.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I have to admit, when i first heard \\"The Way Up\\", i thought, Pat(Metheny) fell short with this album. but after a few more listenings, it's just pure-genius! the complex cords, horns, and beats,you've done it again, Pat!! dust-off another \\"grammy\\" for the PMG in 2005!
B00005JNPZ|3.0|It isn't quite accurate to dismiss Andy Tennant's \\"Hitch\\" as just another silly romantic comedy. It is both less and more than that. The more I thought about the stupid, by-the-numbers script, the more I loathed it. But the extraordinary charm of the three lead actors make up for a great deal, if not for everything. Will Smith is the obvious reason why people are flocking to this film, and he's a better reason than usual for a movie like this. If there's ever been a black Cary Grant, then certainly it's Smith, with his smooth, airy yet masculine charm and seemingly effortless gift for comedy. He and his leading lady, Eva Mendes, have loads of sexy chemistry together, while as one of Smith's \\"Date Doctor\\" clients, Kevin James is the most lovable cinematic overweight slob since the late John Candy. (As a real-life overweight slob, I salute him.) But the script--OUCH! I cite only the most egregious example of its lameness and imbecility: toward the end of the movie, Mendes--jumping to conclusions on the flimsiest of evidence--takes actions that cause nearly irreparable harm not only to Smith, but also to James, whom she's never even met. Later on, she tells Smith, \\"I never meant to hurt you.\\" Bullhockey! She obviously meant not only to hurt him, but to destroy both him and James utterly. Yet the mechanics of the script demand that we take her apology at face value and regard Smith as a big old meanie because he doesn't. In the absence of evidence that the scriptwriters actually thought Mendes' behavior was justifiable, I can only assume they wanted to create the obligatory complications toward Smith and Mendes getting together, and were either too lazy or too dumb to create good ones. So this movie gets three stars--one each for Smith, Mendes, and James--and absolutely none for the script.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Simply put, this movie was a work of art in my eyes.  Alfonso Cuaron's direction puts the first two shame.  They were excellent, but appear bland and even chessy beside Prisoner of Azkaban.  Azkaban realized the grittiness that becomes more and more evident as the book series progresses and that was completely.  The movie portrays beautifully the transformation in Harry from little kid to a more mature teenager.  The wand scene at the very beginning was absolutely classic. <br /> <br />The movie is itself is beautiful in all regards, from the character development, to the plot, and the scenery and Cuaron's overall vision.  Due to certain circumstances I saw the movie in the theater three times in four days, and the more I watched it, the more I loved it, which really says something.  It is dark and riveting.  Right now I am wondering if they are even bothering to attempt a PG rating.  The fourth book could easily be a PG-13, which would please me immensely.  I only hope that it lives up to the standards set by Prisoner of Azkaban.  I was devasted when I heard that Cuaron would not direct the fourth movie.  I am also ticked off that Cuaron was not even considered for best director at the Oscars.  He deserves it, but the Academy sucks.  In conclusion, this movie was brilliant.
B00006879E|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've ever purchased.  The mix of jazzy, love and dancing around your house songs is phenomenal!  This is a fun CD that is full of soul.  I love every song on it!
0553573403|5.0|I was almost in tears after being so cruelly betrayed by the rapid degradation of Wheel of Time, but then I was saved by this insanely ingenius masterpiece.  But I must say, if you are not into blood, graphic violence, sex, incest, etc., then this book might be a bit over the top for you, but otherwise it is fabulous.<br /><br />The story rotates around the viewpoints of several main characters, leeting you get into their heads and really seeing them develop.  It is hard to describe exactly what the book is about because it is so beautifully twisted and unpredictitable.  The characters are not the typical fantasy sterotypes but real people that you will love and love to hate.  What makes this book so appealing is the fact that that the characters are for the most part gray, some lighter and some darker, and are driven by their own motives, not for the sake of good and evil.  Game of Thrones puts all other fantasy to shame and kicks the ass of Wheel of Time.  Hard.<br /><br />Author George RR Martin has revived the genre of fantasy and created vastly higher standards for future releases.  He writes boldly without convention hovering over him.  His style and story is fearless and dark, raw and riveting, so wickedly intriguing.  I have seen nothing like it before.  An instant classic.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Ok......This is my favorite Rage Album. Great guitar work by Baldy(Morello). They are one of my favorite bands. I actually listen to music not because of MTV or VH1, but because it has substance. While the album has small instances of monotony, the overall experience is great. When something works such as the guitars, bass, and drums, the artist has to use it. The songs do not all sound the same.  I have much respect for Baldy. The man has skills.............mad skills. My favorite track is New Millenium Homes. This song is not mainstream, but I love it because of the bass line. Great song. This is, in my opinion, Rage's Masterpiece. And to the @$$hole that said at least Brittany can make your body move.........You can rot.  <br /> <br />Thanks everyone for their time and if you like good music, this album will not let you down.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This movie is worth the money, buy it!  It is a zombie movie with bits of humor injected throughout.  It was just the right mix not too heavy in either direction.  Spots of gore and some tense scenes with some very funny bits.  Not a 5 star movie, let's face it, not many are but a great one nontheless.
B000002J09|4.0|All the hype surrounding this band has been around since I can rememeber,they are apptly called   <br />\\"the fathers of hard rock\\". <br />True to their reputation,these guys CAN rock.'Black Dog' and 'Rock and Roll' are awesome rock songs,loud and catchy with great guitar work,makes U wanna jump off the walls. <br />'When the levee breaks' is probably my favourite song on the album.Although a cover version of an old blues song,it is hard and heavy rock,a song that has a lot of essence. <br />For me the rest of the songs are average,maybe above average at times.Jimmy Page's voice is probably not the strongest on this album,this being evident on some of the songs. <br />The slower songs on the album has their merit,but to be honest,I find them boring and uninspiring. <br />When I listen to Zeppelin,I want to hear hard rock. <br />Writing this band off due to personal taste will be a great misjudgement,millions of fans around the world who almost worship Zeppelin will prove me very wrong. <br />In addition to this,the music on this album is of an exeptional quality,personal taste aside.All in all a good buy.
B00005VPI6|5.0|The best thing about Heyer is that, as the inventer of the genre, she didn't have a formula; you never know who you're going to find as the hero/heroine of her novels. Freddy is probably her most unusual and most lovable. Freddy grows on the reader like moss, and you don't really notice 'til you're lost. As Kitty so insightfully notes, in their post Napoleanic world, he is exactly the kind of hero a woman of her station needs. OK, she doesn't say it quite like that, but the point remains that light-minded Freddy is ideal for the regency world she inhabits.  <br />The humor in this novel is priceless and, unlike all the imitators, most of it is at the hero's expense. I'd take a ride around London with Freddy any time. <br />
B000006TRV|5.0|Okay, for all the kids on here bitchen and moaning about how bad these albums are hear this.  I am 17 and I personally love pink floyd, led zeplin, the who, the doors ...ect just because it is older music doesn't make it crappy.  Bands now dasy have nothing close to the skill and artistic ablility to match someone like jimmy page's guitar skills, or roger waters lyric creativity.  Instead of complain on here why dont you grow up and listen to your backstreet boys and leave everyone who enjoys this music alone....Anyway, since everyone else has explained this Cd so well, all I can do is agree.  I think that if you understand what the wall is about, you will love it. Otherwise its just a bunch of random songs about weird topics that you wouldn't understand.  This is for the pink floyd fans, I dont suggest this as your first pink floyd cd, but it is definitly one of the best.
B00005IC2H|3.0|For me, this outing really falls away after the third track into noodling and doodling with percussive rushes and jazz lines that simply don't transport. Funeral music for astronauts has been one derogative remark I've heard, and it's not far wide of the mark. The magnificent 'Svenfng Englar' had it been supported by the other pieces, would have put this work at the very heights of ambient music. It's a difficult act to follow. As it is, too much is elevator music headed for the basement. The aforementioned opening tracks embrace me with an oceanic pleasure, a submarine, floating world of dazzling colours, free of stress.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Such an amazing amount of potential for great filmic adaptations lay in Homer's work, so it's no surprise that a big budget Hollywood blockbuster should manage to make it a brainless, pandering, insulting vehicle for big explosions and Brad Pitt's greased up body. I could write more, but then I'd really be wasting my time. Don't see it unless you hate literature (or yourself).
B0001DI0FI|4.0|As a student of naval history, it is gratifying to see a movie from the perspective of the whole ship's company -- men and officers. It is much easier to sail in today's naval vessels compared to what is depicted in this film. And the film offers a gritty, harsh, realistic view of what it was like to sail for months on board an early 19th warship.<br /><br />I'd rank this film up there with the Hornblower series. Capt. Jack Aubrey (played by Russell Crowe) shows his stuff as quite the renaissance man -- playing a string duet with his friend, the doctor, supervising the lashing of a wayward sailor, girding his men for the tough battle to come with a formidable French frigate, and weeping when reading over his men who died in battle.<br /><br />All in all -- a fine movie about ships of war that sailed the oceans about 200 years ago and a strong performance by the wole cast.
B000089J0R|5.0|Power Metal bands are often cut from the same cloth these days. It seems like Satan uses the same mold when creating new bands, giving a whole new twist on the word cookie cutter! Fast tempos, high vocals, solos, and similar tempos create the impression that there is a lack of creativity within this genre. However, there sometimes is a band that stands out, even if they're not a whole lot different. Dragonforce is one of these bands. I hear the influence of classic Blind Guardian albums like Tales from the Twilight World and Somewhere Far Beyond when listening to this, as well as Grave Digger, and even a bit of Yngwie/Stratovarius/Sonata type neo classical metal and classic british metal thrown in. Original? Not neccesarily. Fun and inspiring? Hell yes! In fact, the songs have enough distinction (though still not much) to make them stick in your head for days. Hopefully this album is not a fluke like Lost Horizon's debut. I toast my ale to Dragonforce! All hail British Metal!
B00003CXDG|1.0|You maybe thinking to yourself, what does the title of this review have to do with the movie?  We'll let me explain.  I saw this \\"movie\\" when it came out in 2000 in the theatre.  I had seen the first Mission Impossible and was pleased.  This sequel is what is quintessentially wrong with Hollywood.  When a movie makes some money, immediately Hollywood wants to run out and make another one and rake in more bucks at the expense of good story telling.  I swear, if they could, they'd make a Titanic 2.<br />(But what does this have to do with your review title?) We'll here it is.  I was so disappointed, so mad, so angry that this garbage made it to a movie theatre and charged ME over 8 bucks to see it, that 5 years after it came out, I'm still angry.  So angry I'm writing a review about how awful this mess is.  To put it another way, If I could travel to another dimension in time and space, the pain that watching this movie would cause, would still reach me.  So what am I talking about, exactly?  The last 15 minutes of the movie alone will make my point.  To be sure, this uber-toxic disease which required its first subject to be hospitalized, bed ridden with weeping soars and pustules, only causes our female hero a slight red eye and sniffly nose even though she has had the same level of exposure.  Tom Cruise can somehow kick a gun laterally, in the sand, have it \\"pop up\\" 3 feet in the air grab it, aim and fire at a low lying target (the villain) who already has a bead on Tom with gun fully loaded.  Tom gets off two shots and our villian can't hit the broad side of a barn. (lame isn't the word) The motorcycle scene when Tom (ethan hunt) is skidding on the ground with his feet (roller skates) and doesn't get thrown off his bike.  The director with his \\"white doves\\" nonsense as tom enters a room to shoot everybody as some sort of holier-than-thou-bad-ass.  If I ever met either tom cruise or john woo in real life, i'd demand they pay me the 20 bucks (ticket, popcorn and soda) that I shelled out for watching this garbage.  I'd also strap them to a chair and make them watch 2 hours of static and make them loose two hours of their lives.  Why am I writing this now? I saw all of 15 seconds of this awful movie, flipping through channels on cable and got angry that it was STILL being shown to the public and that nobody had filed \\"crimes against humanity\\" charges against the USA network.  I am pleading with Amazon, PLEASE let me give this star to something else... Mi2 is NOT worthy of such high praise!at I shelled out for watching this garbage.

0312995423|2.0|The book has an interesting plot, and the story takes some surprising twists, so it is in no sense boring. The problem is, the main characters stay pale throughout the story. And the book is also quite flawed from a technical point of view, which really confines the reading experience for the average techie with some basic knowledge about cryptography.    The leading character, IQ-170 wonder-mathematician Susan Fletcher does not even grasp the most obvious coherences. The final showdown is quite unrealistic as well, when a software worm takes down the NSA's security tiers one by one, and the agency's director decides to take the risk, instead of simply shutting down the system. Or the fact that their massive-parallel miracle-system goes up in flames due to overheating (No heating ventilation? No emergency shutdown? And no backups and no redundant datacenter?). Listing all the book's flaws when it comes to cryptogaphic issues would take hours - nearly all statements regarding this topic are just plainly wrong [...]In the book's foreword, the author says thanks to \\"the two faceless ex-NSA cryptographers who made invaluable contributions via anonymous remailers\\". Makes me wish they would have proof-read it once.
B000244FDW|5.0|I love this miniseries much better than A&E version, especially with Elizabeth. Jennifer Ehle seems too old and too chubby for the character. Elizabeth Garvie is truer to the Elizabeth in the book.
B00005Y23E|4.0|Don't get me wrong, the music is first rate and deserves 5 stars. The remixes are a nice addition minus the disco version of Buffalo Soldier. I and I like the added drums on No Woman no Cry. One problem with the european cd version though : the two One love on the remix cd are the same version. Beware !
B00005JLWN|5.0|Expertly throwing the harshness of a society in which the good of every individual is sacrificed for the good of the society as a whole into sharp relief, Kurt Wimmer introduces us to his masterpiece Equilibrium.  This is a poignant and powerful tale of the consequences of sacrificing that which makes us human.  By using elements of George Orwell and Ray Bradbury, Wimmer draws his audience into a gritty hellish reality where the unexpected is a regular occurance.   <br /> <br />Several things that I loved about this movie are outlined below: <br /> <br />The use of color, or rather the lack thereof.  Color evokes emotion, and so all the costumes are done in shades of grey and black.  Add to this the backdrop of a harsh limestone architecture and you have a canvas adorned in grey and black alone and yet it conveys the sense of a beautiful picture dispite its bleakness. <br /> <br />The music.  The music is beautifully crafted to expertly counterpoint the emotional context of the movie.  Frequently you will find your emotions being manipulated by the beautiful imagery created by both original scores and classic pieces like Beethoven's 4th symphony. <br /> <br />The cinematography.  This is one of the most cleverly shot movies ever.  The angles tend to communicate an emotional subtext which moves from harsh, ninety degree angles to flowing curves and even an absence of conventional corners. <br /> <br />The writing.  The script for this movie must be experienced.  I won't even attempt to demonstrate how well this screenplay is written. <br /> <br />The action.  The action sequences in this movie are awesome!  The visceral realism of much of the action makes The Matrix look like The Karate Kid.  Guns are used in an interesting way as they are considered to be simply an extension of the arm (like many melee weapons are) and the aesthetic ballet of the action sequences are reminescent of poetry.  <br /> <br />
0765310015|4.0|Believe it or not some people do not like Lobster! The texture's not right, it looks ugly, it's difficult to get into and it demands too much investment. Lobster is an acquired taste but once aquired the pleasures are prodigious; Gardens of the Moon is as Lobster.  <br />There is no mollycoddling introduction to the sprawling Malazan Empire. From the outset the reader must hit the ground running, and then keep running as Erikson does not give much opportunity to take a breath. With multiple characters, multiple view points and multiple plotlines, Gardens of the Moons, throws the reader violently into the midst of a socerous world in flux.  <br />Erikson never holds the readers hand in this book, characters are not conveniently introduced one by one with their personalities and alligences presented in neat, gift wraped packages; backgrounds and histories are not outlined in explanatory chapters to help the reader's understanding.  <br />Instead you are challenged to think.  <br />You draw you own conclusion as to what a charcter is from what he is doing, not from what the author is tells you he is. You get to piece together the world in which this Tale of the Fallen is taking place. The threads of this tapesty are woven in the most unique fashion, as more of the scene is revealed, we relises how little of the picture we are actually seeing. All the answers to all the questions are not in this one book, yet the tale is in itself complete. (Much verve has made of Erikson's 10 book deal, however, each Tale has been written, and are worthy of being judged, as stand alone books.) <br />Gardens of the Moon is fantasy at a higher level. It's ambitious, it's sprawling but, most importantly, it challenges the mould. Expect to be uncomfortable when you read this book for the first time it doesn't read like normal fantasy. It is different, but, it is exactly what you've been waiting for; and this is just this is the beginning. The best part about GotM is when you've finished you can get your teeth into Deadhouse Gates! If GotM is the Lobster, DG is Death by Chocolate. If you're not hooked on the series after that one, well, maybe fantasy is not the genre for you.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Hey, Brad Pitt, the surf's up! Where's your surf board? This is what played in my mind the whole time I watched this extravaganza of mindless boredom. Pitt's pretty, with sharply defined abs and hair extensions and bronzer. But Hollywood's obsession with pretty boys, instead of real he-men, is fatally on display here. To me, Troy was a ferociously charismatic warrior--like Steve Reeves. In fact, if a theater should double-bill \\"Troy\\" along with a typical Reeves flesh-and-fur spectacle from the late fifties, the Reeves potboiler would probably be a lot more enjoyable. \\"Gladiator\\" got it right in many ways. It had Russell Crowe as the stern looking, beefy hero who looked like he had been around the block a few times. Watching Pitt, I wondered how much plastic surgery he's undergone so far?
B00000K31V|4.0|Well though i think jude law is an incredible actor this probabally was not his best movie.  He has been in quite a bit better movies and i absolutely thought he was awesome in \\"enemy at the gates\\".  But with all that aside the movie contained a great number of twists and thrills in a science fiction world where you dont just play the video game you are in the video game.  Interacting in a role playing enviroment with many twists and turns.  The movie is definitely a movie that you must really get into to, to truly enjoy.  Also know that when you are watching it, it is going to be very weird and rather thought provoking, but enjoyable.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Such a genius creation. I absolutley love watching Lorelei and Rory grow together. I have all the seasons on DVD and I advise you to do the same, you will never grow tired of them. <br /> <br />Katie, New York City
B000002UTO|5.0|I just discovered this album, and it is amazing - even moer amazing is why it got lambasted by critics when it was released! <br />The title track has a great beat, but my absolute favorites are \\"Too Late, Marlene,\\" \\"Do You Believe in Shame\\" and \\"Edge of American\\" - all three are beautiful (mid-tempo) ballads, and once again, Simon proves he is one of the most talented song writers out there.  Definitely recommended.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is so hilariously sweet that I can't get enough of it. Destined to become a classic, ND's lines, characters and scenes are already being burned into memory by fans - a \\"buyer\\" (not a \\"renter\\") if ever there was one.<br /><br />The film assembles a cast of the weirdest, most engaging characters seen on screen in many a day. ND follows the crazy/ordinary life of Napoleon Dynamite, high school giga-nerd, his scrawny older brother Kip, 1982-obsessed Uncle Rico, uptight girlfriend Deb, dim-bulb-yet-ambitious Pedro and a host of other misfit types who should be familiar to anyone who has endured the American school scene. Set in rural Idaho, there's no particular plot other than getting through the school day, fending off jocks and beauty queens, trying to get a tetherball partner and attempting sweet jumps on bikes. Along the way, the film provided dead-on satires of martial arts commercials, school elections, wild grandmas, glamour photography and the inanities of life itself.<br /><br />Napoleon (Jonn Heder) is a frizzy-haired, bespectacled beanpole who is unpopular but doesn't care. He spends his school day drawing magical animals, yearning for a \\"skill\\" and ludicrously lying about his dangerousness to others who know better. Heder perfectly captures the type: prickly toward all those who threaten or annoy him (including grade-schoolers), never making eye-contact, mouth always agape, unathletic and uncoordinated. His unironic delivery of exclamations like \\"Idiot!\\" and \\"Whatever I want! Gosh!\\" and \\"Lucky!\\" (this delivered when an unlikely character lands an outlandishly sexy \\"soulmate\\") are quickly becoming classic. This film is a winner on many, many levels.
0060763280|5.0|This is a great book on how to start moving towards creating wealth instead of wasting time sitting around on your keester just thinking about it. <br /> <br />My only quibbles with the book are: <br /> <br />1. Harv needs to realize that even Donald Trump could use his help. Trump is a perfect example of the person who goes from boom to bust to boom in a never-ending cycle. I have lost count of how many times The Donald has teetered on bankruptcy or fallen into it--as he has currently. <br /> <br />So, Harv, please stop using this trustafarian as an example of a successful person. He's not! <br /> <br />2. Harv should be more honest about mlms or so-called network marketing schemes. Now I am a big boy and understand that he knows that these people will buy a lot of his books, so he doesn't want to drive them away. <br /> <br />But Harv, be honest, pyramids are an abomination. There's no faster way to lose your money and friends and have everyone snickering behind your back at your gullibility than by joining one. <br /> <br />Other than that, kudoes to the Harvmeister!
B0000844I8|4.0|...and therefore of course highly recommended for those of you who enjoy sci-fi-adventure-movies, and previous and later releases of director Roland Emmerich. The special-effects are rather impressive, costumes and acting as well (Kurt Russell as always delievers with a certain style).  <br /> <br />There's an Indiana Jones-feel to \\"Stargate\\", mostly because of the fabolous music-score of course (very similar to the Indiana-score I think) -but there's also just as much adventure to the movie, perfect for a day you spend indoors because of bad weather or such.  <br /> <br />Recommended!
0670033375|5.0|In the opinion of a well-informed agricultural scientist pushing 79 who has been exposed to the ideas of conservation and sustainability in ag school more than 60 years ago (in 1943) Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" is the most well-documented, sophisticated and yet not overly alarmist book published to date on the subject. Its message is an ominous warning: in the near future (within 25 years or so) human society in the entire world, not merely this or that region (e.g. China) may suffer terrible consequences if continuing  universal environmental damage and overpopulation are not radically dealt with. My children and my grandchildren - and yours - will suffer the consequences. Many readers noted that with a good editor the book could be much shorter (I agree).  Nevertheless, as  it stands, it is brilliant and devastating.<br /><br />Watch out! The are lots of reviews by laymen who ignore the principles of conservation of resources (water, land, fish, fresh air, energy, ores etc.) and those of sustainability.  A number of vocal detractors only read passages and a few hardly glanced at the book. Some concentrate on criticizing non-essential errors in the book.<br /><br />I read the book from A to Z and very many reviews.  What I have to say has been said. I suggest you START with two early-bird  reviews labeled (by Amazon) \\"Most helpful\\":  that of  Ellis O. Jones (Jan 7, 2005) and of J.P.G. Cox. (Jan 3, 2005). Both gave COLLAPSE five  stars;  by now (August 22, 2005) Jones got 375 out of 406 HELPFUL votes and Cox 261 out of 311. That's an average 86% of helpful-favorable votes from a sample of 717. This value may well be considered as the consensus of the readers.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I decided to review A Perfect Circle's Thirteenth Step.  This album is absolutely amazing.  Thirteenth Step follows a similar sound pattern as its predecessor, Mer De Noms, however there are songs on the new album that are much heavier and divergent than those on the first.  Still, in both albums there is a sort of self-reflection that I believe the singer is trying to convey as well as, in many songs, a conviction for hypocrisy in various situations.  In both albums there is also a sense of disappointment that can be noted in certain songs.  For example, \\"3 Libras\\" from Mer De Noms and \\"A Stranger\\" from Thirteenth Step both contain lyrics that seem to display a feeling of non-existence.  In \\"3 Libras\\" the ending lyric states, \\"Oh well, apparently nothing, apparently nothing at all.  You don't see me at all.\\"  \\"A Stranger\\" similarly contains a lyric of nothingness stating, \\"You're a stranger, so what do I care?  You vanish today, not the first time I hear all the lies.\\"   There is also political innuendoes found in both albums, but more solidly found in Thirteenth Step.  The lyrics in \\"Pet\\" display a sense of disdain for war and the brainwashing that can go along with it, hence the name of the track.  The lyrics found in the chorus are indicative of this, \\"Lay your head down child.  I won't let the boogeyman come.  Counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of war drums.  Pay no mind to the rabble.  Pay no mind to the rabble.  Head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums.\\"  <br /> <br /> \\"The Noose\\" found on the Thirteenth Step album contains a great deal of symbolism that is often signature of A Perfect Circle's work.  Following their theme of hypocrisy, the chorus of \\"The Noose\\" states, \\"And not to pull your halo down around your neck and tug you off your cloud, but I'm more than just a little curious how you're planning to go about making your amends to the dead.\\"  The track follows an ABABC pattern and begins quietly.  Before the beginning lyric, drums enter and then an electric guitar (timbre).  When the lead vocalist begins to sing a piano enters the song (timbre as well).  At the first chorus the track becomes louder and the music follows the pattern every time for A and every time for B.  After the second chorus C enters the track and becomes loud and homophonic (versus the original monophony of the song).  And while this particular track heavier than others, it still has a smooth melody. <br /> <br /> In a very similar fashion, \\"A Stranger\\" carries a smooth melody and begins softly.  This track's form is different in that it really doesn't have a chorus.  Each part follows a specific pattern until the end, so you can call each section in the beginning A, and the end B.  Before the first lyric a guitar plays quietly until the vocalist begins to sing.  In between each section in the beginning a violin enters and then fades before the next segment of song.  After the third segment the track becomes louder and the lyrics are echoed.  In section B all timbres are in action (vocal, guitar, and violin) and the song ends in a monophony.  In both tracks discussed they each begin softly only to end loudly.  This is very much characteristic of A Perfect Circle and a consistent quality in many of their pieces as well. <br /> <br /> The sound and rhythm of a band will draw me to it.  I love uniqueness in music and that is what draws me to A Perfect Circle.  While they can still be hard core, there is a certain poetry in their lyrics that symbolizes so many different aspects in life.  There is depth to what the band tries to convey without them trying hard to convey it.  What makes them interesting is that the message is left for the listener to decode.  It is not spelled out and they do not strive to make who hears it understand it; it just is.  Every album of theirs seems to progress.  You can hear it in the instrumentals as well as the lyrics.  Ultimately, A Perfect Circle is ingenious in creating music in that theyfully encompass hard rock without any stereotypical jargon attached.  They are not media stars seeking the limelight.  Publicity is not what sells their records, their music does. <br /> <br /> One might say that A Perfect Circle has a certain Deftones quality.  Each band is passionate about poetic music dealing with hypocrisy and darkness in relationships.  Each band also has a very unique sound to it that is its trademark.  The Deftones and A Perfect Circle have lead vocalists that carry songs from soft tones to extremely loud and heavy melodies and harmonies.  Both bands are heavy while ironically having soft spoken vocalists.  Tool, most obviously, sounds and functions quite similarly as A Perfect Circle due to the fact that each band's lead singer is the same.  Thirteenth Step is an amazing album that should be heard by those who have an appreciation for words and music.  Mer De Noms, the predecessor to Thirteenth Step, is equally wonderful but is not quite as heavy.  Each album rocks however!!! <br />
B00003CWL6|1.0|I nearly vomited when I saw this travesty.  To think that it won an Oscar for Best Picture is totally in keeping with the depraved Hollywood style of today.  If you prefer decent films stick with the black and white classics or most of Disney.  American Beauty should be retitled \\"American Ugly\\".  There is nothing beautiful about this film.  It is grotesque, glorifying just about every decaying moral in today's society.  This type of film is what is wrong with America today.  Heaven help us!!!
6305513414|3.0|\\"Mudd's Women\\" presents the first of two appearances by the space rogue Harcourt Fenton Mudd (Roger C. Carmel).  In this episode, he is pimping for a trio of artificially enhanced women who owe their beauty to a drug.  Classic Trek episodes always tend to be moralistic (in fact, that was a point of pride for Gene Roddenberry), but when Kirk (William Shatner) actually delivers a sermon, as he does at the end of this episode, you know they've gone too far.  A slow episode, but occasionally fun. <br /> <br />In \\"The Enemy Within,\\" a transporter accident splits Kirk into his evil half and good half.  The premise is weak, because it gives up any pretense of scientific plausibility and drops the show squarely into the middle of magic fantasy land.  The only thing missing is a yellow brick road.  This episode also features some stunningly egregious overacting by Shatner.  This is not as damaging as it sounds.  There is something invulnerable about William Shatner as a performer; the worse he gets, the more cheesy fun it is to watch him.  Writer Richard Matheson does manage to slip in some interesting stuff about the necessity of a dark side for a successful leader. <br />
6305841861|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever made. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell give us the best sequel in horror movie history. This movie also shows the overall stupidity of Ash, the chainsaw-handed zombie hunter. He doesn't just return to the same cabin as in the first one, but he spends the first half of the movie without any recollection to what happened before or that his new girlfriend has the same name as the one that died in \\"Evil Dead.\\" This movie is a must have for any horror fan.
B000001FKY|5.0|This really is a great album. Their intensity and devotion may have slowly faded over the years, but regardless, classic Def Leppard is untouchable. Awesome guys too, I met them mid-90s backstage at a show. Shaking the dummers hand, however, is always a cause for laughter and confusion. Rock on...
B00009L1TA|4.0|Twist-wise this is a heckuvagreat movie.  It's a steaming, down and dirty whodunnit-to-who under the guise of an army training exercise gone wrong.  A Special Force team goes into the jungles of Panama, under the supervision of Samuel L. Jackson (West,) but they don't all come out.  The onus of finding out what happened falls on Connie Nielsen (Osborne), but then Tim Daly (Styles) brings in John Travolta (Hardy) to take over the investigation.<br /><br />It's not Travolta's best role, but he does a passable Hardy, the great inquisitor.  Connie Nielsen steals most of the movie, even though her accent grates on the nerves sometimes, but otherwise she's got what it takes.  Timothy Daly is good for most of the movie (until the end), and there just isn't enough Samuel L. Jackson to go around.<br /><br />Poor Giovanni Ribisi - he must be really tired of being type-cast by now.  He plays the same role, once again, for the umpteenth time.<br /><br />My problem with the movie is that a lot of the scenes are shot out of focus and in the dark - so it's hard to figure out who's doing what to whom most of the time. (My copy didn't have sub-titles, and the close-captioning was pathetic, so that didn't help much)<br /><br />Any attempt to summarize the plot would contain spoilers, so I won't.  Spending a few hours on this 3.5 star movie, wouldn't be time wasted.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 25, 2005
B00006LJ6X|5.0|After the relatively downbeat pop of \\"Chicago VI,\\" this album shows an energetic Chicago with a positive musical outlook.  While the pop element is retained, there are also incredible jazz moments that can take you back to the first three Chicago albums.<br /><br />The first five tracks are instrumentals, yielding more than 25 minutes of wonderful music that alternates between jazz, progressive jazz, jazz-rock, and other combinations that are easy to lose in the complexity of the music.  The instruments include congas, horns, keyboards, including a mellotron, Fender Rhodes, ARP synthesizer, and clavinet, a flute, drums and guitars.<br /><br />\\"Prelude to Aire\\" provides an initial indication of the flavor of the instrumentals with a strongly African influenced beat.  If you liked Paul Simon's \\"Graceland,\\" you should also like \\"Prelude to Aire.\\"  \\"Aire\\" is a jazz instrumental with but a flavor of the introductory song.  Peter Cetera and Terry Kath both get to strut their stuff in the second half of the song, with Terry Kath turning funky for a portion of his lead.<br /><br />\\"Aire\\" is complex and relatively long at almost six and a half minutes, but the following instrumental, \\"Devil's Sweet,\\" is even longer.  Portions of this ten minute composition are introspective, allowing jazz noodling of a core musical theme.  Certain portions remind me of some of King Crimson's more experimental 70s work.  The mixture of 50s retro style with Jazz and rock creates an interesting instrumental composition that requires multiple listens for full appreciation.  \\"Italian from New York\\" fits well with the previous instrumentals.  This instrumental begins with sound effects that are retro, yet modern.  The sound effects are married to horns and later a funky guitar to create a fusion that is new and old, interesting and unique.  The last instrumental composition, \\"Hanky Panky,\\" sets up the transition from the instrumental mini-suite to the first song of the album.  \\"Hanky Panky\\" is a celebration of music and jazz and declares its enthusiasm for the music that came before and the music that comes after.<br /><br />The first song keeps a jazz theme for continuity with the opening instrumentals.  The vocals have a Beatle's style when they open, and \\"Life Saver's\\" peppy beat sets the optimistic tone for the music of this CD.  \\"Happy Man\\" is a mellow pop love song from Peter Cetera.  The pace is slower than the earlier songs, and yet the song is a celebration, with upbeat percussion and vocals.<br /><br />The next song was the first hit from this album.  An edited version of \\"(I've Been) Searchin' So Long\\" was backed by \\"Byblos\\" in release.  The single reached #9 on the Hot 100 and #8 on the Easy Listening charts.  As was typical of Chicago's music at that time, the music was very carefully arranged and heavily orchestrated.  This pop song is flavored by horns rather than being a true jazz fusion.  This song also features strings to further expand the complexity of the music.  The vocals are arranged with similar complexity and make this song one of Chicago's all-time greats.<br /><br />I have no idea what \\"Mongonucleosis\\" is about.  The lyrics are \\"Que pe chesa\\" repeated.  The music is Hispanic-styled and fast.  This music is easy on the ear and fun, maintaining the optimistic tone of the album.  \\"Song of the Evergreens\\" is Terry Kath poetry.  The lyrics are evocative and the complex music is rock.  The repeated \\"snow\\" lyrics at the end of the song could be annoying, and yet they are not.  Once again the music is catchy and tempts you to hum along.  Near the end of the song the guitars break down into a funky sound characteristic of the mid-70s.<br /><br />\\"Byblos\\" is a lyrically complex song.  This song is a story song in the tradition of those sung by Harry Chapin and Gordon Lightfoot.  We never learn her name, but we know she affects those around her with her presence, an inner beauty that makes you long for her presence once more, while feeling comfortable just because she is in the world.  This song is yet another Terry Kath poem set to mellow and pretty music.<br /><br />The next song has always been one of my all-time Chicago favorites.  \\"Wishing You Were Here\\" was ethereal and haunting well before that type of song was popular in rock.  Chicago's vocals are enhanced by the presence of the Dennis and Carl Wilson and Al Jardine of the Beach Boys.  There is also an interesting synthesizer contribution to this song that helps provide an eerie aspect to the song's ethereal air.  This song is one that must be heard to be appreciated.  This song reached #11 on the Hot 100 chart and #1 on the Easy Listening chart, backed by \\"Life Saver.\\"<br /><br />The next song charted #6 on the Hot 100 chart and also went to #1 on the easy listening chart.  \\"Call on Me,\\" backed by \\"Prelude to Aire,\\" is a jazz-influenced pop love song.  The lyrics are simple with yet more catchy pop hooks.  The song speeds up at the end to rush through the last 30 seconds, leading into \\"Women Don't Want to Love Me.\\"  This song has a funky blues rhythm and is a breakup song.  Similarly, \\"Skinny Boy\\" also has a funky blues style.  Both songs are by Robert Lamm.<br /><br />This version of the CD includes a rehearsal of \\"Byblos,\\" which pushes the total time for this CD to about 78 minutes, indicative of the original double vinyl album.  This rehearsal is shorter than the released version, and contains some variation from the original.<br /><br />From \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" Chicago just seemed to get better and better.  This CD shows pop influence, but there are just as many other influences, including jazz, blues and even Hispanic.  This music is more than just great pop or rock; it is great music, period.  If you are going to own music by Chicago, this CD is a must.omfortable just because she is in the world.  This song is yet another Terry Kath poem set to mellow and pretty music.<br /><br />The next song has always been one of my all-time Chicago favorites.  \\"Wishing You Were Here\\" was ethereal and haunting well before that type of song was popular in rock.

This rehearsal is shorter than the released version, and contains some variation from the original.<br /><br />From \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" Chicago just seemed to get better and better.  This CD shows pop influence, but there are just as many other influences, including jazz, blues and even Hispanic.  This music is more than just great pop or rock; it is great music, period.  If you are going to own music by Chicago, this CD is a must.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' is without a doubt one of the coolest movies ever made!  Giant robots, rockets, jet packs, ray guns, mutant animals - Sky Captain's got all this and so much more!  Every frame of this film is a work of art!  The widescreen DVD release is perfect except for three things: 1) Viewers are forced to watch (or skip through) several trailers for movies no one cares about before finally getting to Sky Captain's main menu; 2) The DVD case doesn't come with an insert - what's up with that?! 3) With all that tremendous Kevin Conran artwork lying around, how come the powers that be gave us such a lackluster DVD cover?  5 stars for the movie, 4 and a half for the disc.
B00005B36H|3.0|After spending half my life listening to bands, this was the last music album I ever listened to. I liked it, but it convinced me that music, particulary of this kind, is not a good thing. Tool always have something to say, but I think they and bands like them shouldn't, because they don't know the truth, and are often in conflict with it. Tool is a lost people.
B0000541AM|5.0|In the late 1970's and 1980's, while most people were going to midnight movies to see The Rocky Horror Picture Show, my friends and I were going to see \\"The Warriors\\".  We were every bit as enthusiastic as the fans of Rocky Horror were in reciting lines and bringing props.  It was all in tribute for one of the great cult movies of the times.  Sadly The Warriors hasn't had the staying power of other cult films but remains a favoite of mine to this day.<br /><br />The plot is simplistic and merely a means to set-up the fights between rival gangs.  The Gramercy Riffs, the largest gang in NY, calls a meeting in the Bronx for all the gangs to attend.  Each is to send nine members of their gang to attend the summit and a truce is declared.  Cyrus, leader of the Riffs has a plan to organize all of the gangs into one large gang to take over the city.  But not everyone likes the idea. Cyrus is shot by Luther (David Patrick Kelly), the leader of the Rogues.  One of the Warriors witnesses the shooting and the Rogues lay the blame on the Warriors.<br /><br />The Cops arrive in force and the hundreds of gangbangers flee the meeting place.  The Riffs send out the word that the Warriors shot Cyrus and now every gang in the city is looking for them. To make matters worse, the Warriors leader, Cleon, is killed leaving Swan (Michael Beck) as the War Chief.  The Warriors now have to find a way to get home to Coney Island as every gang is \\"looking to bust their heads\\".  Swan's authority is challenged by Ajax (James Remar) who thinks he should be leader.  Meanwhile the streets are infested with gangs such as the Turnbull ACs, The Orphans, The female \\"Lizzies\\", and the surreal Furies, who wear baseball uniforms, paint their faces, and carry baseball bats.<br /><br />The Warriors prove their toughness and resourcefulness as they head for a final showdown with The Rogues on the beaches of Coney.  This was preceded by one of the film's great cult moments when the Rogues Leader Luther puts bottles on the ends of his fingers, clicking them together and screaching out \\"Warriors, Come out and Play!\\"  Needless to say this one of the great \\"play along\\" moments for viewers at midnight shows.<br /><br />The film was widely condemned at the time for its violence and it was a popular film among gang members which often led to fights in the theaters.  But the violence seems rather tame compared to today's Assault rifle-toting gangs.  Rather than gritty realism Walter Hill gives us a movie that is part old-time western, and part modern day fable, not unlike Hill's \\"Streets of Fire\\" made a few years later.<br /><br />Beck and Remar both give outstanding performances as they bicker and battle over control of the gang but David Patrick Kelly steals the show as the devious, cackling leader of the Rogues.<br /><br />Word comes now that a re-make is slated for 2006 with Tony Scott as director.  Scott has directed such action films as \\"Man on Fire\\", \\"Enemy of the State\\", \\"The last Boy Scout\\", and \\"Beverly Hills Cop 2\\".  He certainly has his work cut out for him in re-making this classic cult film.r puts bottles on the ends of his fingers, clicking them together and screaching out \\"Warriors, Come out and Play!\\"  Needless to say this one of the great \\"play along\\" moments for viewers at midnight shows. <br /> <br />The film was widely condemned at the time for its violence and it was a popular film among gang members which often led to fights in the theaters.

B0000CD5FN|5.0|I grew up during the 80's, in a time when The Clash were still in prominence, but I was young enough not to remember any of their hits.  When I got older, I remembered hearing Rock the Casbah and Should I Stay or Should I Go, songs I thought at that time were great.  Then I bought London Calling, The Clash's self-titled CD and Give 'em Enough Rope, and shortly thereafter, The Clash became my favorite band. <br /> <br />Fast forward a decade later, when The Clash split up and each of them went onto their own careers, namely Mick Jones with Big Audio Dynamite and Joe Strummer's project, Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros.  Buying this CD, I had low expectations from what to expect, as I thought The Clash and Joe Strummer really did their best together.  After listening to this CD for awhile, though, it has clearly become my favorite CD.  It starts off with a rockin Coma Girl, to a cover of Bob Marley's Redemption Song, to the last track on the CD, Silver and Gold, a real somber song, as at times, I shed a tear knowing that it was one of Joe Strummer's last songs ever written before he passed away.  This album really has it all, from rock to soft rock, and everything in between. <br /> <br />If you are looking into getting your first Mescaleros CD, I would reccomend this one.  It really hit the note, and really shows that Joe Strummer's legacy will live on.  If you are looking for life after The Clash, I would reccomend this CD too.  Heck, if you're just looking for some good new music, this CD is definetly it.
0141439661|1.0|when my friend read all of jane austen a few years ago and just couldn't stop raving, i thought it was time to give the old girl a test ride around the block and see what all the fuss was about. on first try i fell right off. it was like reading a foreign language. my mind wouldn't stand still long enough to learn it. now, though, with the continued push to read jane austen ever before me (the new book, \\"the jane austen book club\\" peeked my interest), i thought i'd strap on my helmut and give her one more try. a few years of meditation under my belt would surely slow me down and give me more of a chance to \\"get it\\", i thought.<br /><br />she's still out of reach. i was initially teased, even laughed once or twice as i started \\"sense and sensibility\\" but then....it's just soooo boring. austen's portrayal of elinor and marianne and the crew are about as shallow as it gets. there is no depth here in these characters.  my mother even joined me in this reading  endeavor. we started a book club of two, just to accomplish this task... strength in numbers and all that. but, alas, we were both so \\" monstrous\\" bored. it was a \\"sedulous\\" task at best. we have now named our book club the \\"anything BUT jane austen book club\\".<br /><br />the reasons for the boredom:<br /><br />1)i'm just not entranced by long, long, long sentences. proust gave it a go and did a much better job.<br /><br />2)i'm also put off by the confusing use  and over use of pronouns..who really is \\"he\\" and \\"she\\" and \\"they\\"...i think if i'd have submitted this work in college, it would have come back with many margin notes  on grammar, syntax and style.<br /><br />3)i think i got the idea of the social structure and nuances(where there any?) in the first 50 pages.. the rest was just\\" monstrous insipid \\".<br /><br />4)and for the storyline.. when austen lovers run out of austen material do they go on to harlequin romances? seems it would be a  logical move.<br /><br />no more austen for this old girl. life's just too short and there are too many really good books out there.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This sound narrative constantly seeks the heart of god, prays for it. Those who know of what i sepak, know that I do not refer to Gibson's heart or anyone else's. That as these artisans, through the bible, illustrate, even the keeper of god's word, the Sanhedrin, was just a man, as peter admits; And tore his clothing at the words of jesus. <br /> <br />The wind instruments of brotherhood in the midst of spiritual suffering, reflect the reality of such acts, of being in unison with god's will, as being few and far between.I have litte doubt that Maurice Jarre(composer)and Gibson see themesleves as the Sanhedrin, hopeless to find the will of god alone. The melodies are often full of remorse. <br /> <br />But it finishes with a choral music that reflects the grand freedom of truth. One of the few tellings of the story that properly acknowledges the UNANIMOUS universal nature of the scapegoat mechinism, our need to label a human's exsistance evil, to help justify our own. <br /> <br />All abused minorities will find the acknowledgement of thier suffering, and the freeing revelation of the mechanism that marred them,in the story told by this music. a mechinism which, 2000 years ago, found itself with no place to hide.
B00003CXBK|4.0|I have never seen a movie or watched television before, however, I still I really enjoyed this movie!  It is very fun to watch movies and this movie made me want to watch even more movies!  I really liked the story and especially the love story.  I did not like the blood because it was gross. <br />p.s. how weird is it that Claire Danes and Billy Crudup are dating in REAL LIFE, seven years after they recorded the voice tracks?!?!
0062502182|1.0|Personally, I don't really like this book, Santiago's personal legend is to find treasure and live a happy life.  BORING!!!  That is not a great personal legend, I think it doesn't really count.  I think personal legends would be more like, getting a job you love, and making lots of money with it.   <br />I don't think I have a favorite part in this book, but I do have a least favorite.  I did not like it when Santiago read the flight of the hawks.  People should not know what is to come in the future, it could devastate them forever, until the thing happened.  They would always be thinking about it.  I have read many hundreds of books, and this would not be a book that I would recommend to people.
B0002XL35G|5.0|Harry Dean Stanton (She's So Lovely, Sonny) is perfect as Travis, the man who has been missing for years. Nastassja Kinski (Cat People, Rip It Off), sexy as ever plays Stanton's wife. stanton returns from a perfornal journey after years long gone as I said and he returns home but his wife is somewhere else and she left their daughter behind. So Stanton tracks her down to bring her, her daughter.  Serious good movie with Stanton giving 100% of his performance and Kinski does a damn good job as well as the fragile mother who went down the wrong path with the wrong kind of job. There's a lot to be said about a movie so good as this. The last 25-30 minutes are the movies best. Also starring Dean Stockwell (Tv's Quantom Leap, Air Force One)
0440237688|4.0|This book is a very good read.  It's a little bit fantasy, a little bit coming of age, and a little bit drama.  The Giver is the story of a young boy who is chosen to become the new receiver of memories in his town.  He learns more about his community than ever before.   <br /> <br />This book is a quick read and a great story.  It's riveting throughout and especially touching at the end. <br /> <br />4 out of 5 stars
B00061QJZI|3.0|Will Ferrell (Old School, Elf), Paul Rudd (Wet Hot American Summer, The Cider House Rules), David Koechner (Bruce Almighty, Tv's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart), Christina Applegate (Tv's Married With Children, A View From The Top)and Fred Willard (Best In Show, How High) star in this movie about Legandary Anchorman Ron Burgandy. Will Ferrell brings in the laughs as he always does and they kill with each deliver...funny and I liked this better then Dodgeball....a comedy classic of its own kind...laugh, cry...Anchorman is sweet. Actors who make guest cameos are the following: Luke Wilson (Old School, Alex and Emma), Vince Vaughn (Dodgeball,Swingers) , Jack Black (School Of Rock, High Fiedelity), Tim Robbins (Mystic River, The Truth About Charlie), Danny Trejo (Spy Kids, Once Upon A Time In Mexico) and  Ben Stiller (Dodgeball, Zoolander).  <br /> <br />
B00008AWOD|5.0|I'd never heard of Placebo until this year when I was listening to Launchcast Radio on the internet.  I had Sleeping with Ghosts in my wish list here for ages.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Sleeping With Ghosts, Protect Me From What I Want, and Special Needs.<br /><br />I must point out that some fans of Placebo consider this album to not be typical of the band.  They also don't consider the album before it, Black Market Music, to be typical of the band.  But, hey, when 50% of the albums put out by the band are considered atypical, uh, I think you need to redefine what you think the band is really like.<br /><br />Also, I love Black Martet Music too.  Where did these guys come from?  Why has no one heard of them?
B00005JGAB|5.0|LMFAO...at the guy who said that. THEY ARE NOT HEAVY METAL PERIOD. Your an idiot if you think they are....they are a PUNK band...want me to say it again?..PUNK BAND!! It's not heavy metal crap. Lets get back to the cd before i snap once more. This album became inportant to punk. Without them there would not be Punk(imo). No Green Day, Clash,Adicts, Sham 69, SFL, Sex Pistols. You get the idea. All the songs are good. Maybe Repetetive for some, but i dont mind. I like \\"I dont Want To Go Down The Basement\\" I like the lyrics...even if it repeats alot. Still a good Fun CD to own. GOOD FOR PARTY'S!....and remember RAMONES IS NOT HEAVY METAL...IGNORE THE REVIEW.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|After viewing all the episodes in this great collection, I am dumbfounded as to why the show was cancelled.  Was it because FOX TV would rather pay peanuts for inane claptrap reality shows? Or maybe they don't want to ruin their reputation and be associated with a well written, highly entertaining, original show...
B0002PZVHK|5.0|Brian Eno intended his ambient recordings to be sonic wallpaper, interesting wallpaper certainly, but still wallpaper.  These aren't \\"songs\\" in any sense of the word, unconventional or not.  These are soundtracks for your life in it's quieter moments.<br /><br />To get the best enjoyment from On Land, I recommend starting it with the volume very low.  Then slowly increase the volume until it covers any other sounds inside or out, basically functioning as white noise.  Then commence reading, studying, meditating, sleeping, painting, daydreaming or whatever.  I've also listened to it on Walkmans while hiking in the woods for a real weird experience.  Eno builds sound collages meant to invoke outdoor settings ranging from peaceful to creepy.  \\"The Lost Day\\" sounds to me like standing in an old abandoned pasture as dusk approaches, the wind rustling the overgrown grass while the weathered door of the old farmhouse bangs open and shut and some old rusty cowbells, slung over the sagging fence with some mouldering tack, clang away in the breeze.<br /><br />After years of listening to Eno's ambient stuff like Evening Star (with Fripp,) Music for Airports and this one, I think I've figured out the secret to their success:  Eno never lets any piece actually GET anywhere.  Now in conventional music that would be a very bad thing, but in ambient music it's not only a good thing, it's the entire point.  If any of it got anywhere, that would require active participation on the part of the listener, and it's no longer wallpaper, but more akin to minimalist classical music.  Eno knew all of this and that's what makes these records work, and what makes them steer clear of new age blather or elevator muzak.<br /><br />All of Eno's reissues from Here Come the Warm Jets up to this one are highly recommended.
B00005JMAH|5.0|The first two Harry Potter movies, although very enjoyable, had an weirdly \\"too perfect\\" feel to them, like Disney World, with all the bright colors and exceedingly clean sets. This third installment has a more textured, \\"real\\" feeling to it. The computer graphics blend in nicely with the live action and is far superior to the computer graphics in the previous Harry Poter Movies. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and other Hogwarts familiars have all grown up quite a bit, and boy, does it ever show in their performances!! Their acting has improved a lot with age! Lupin and Black are great and the new Dumbledore is adequate, he certainly looks the part, though I doubt will ever truly fill the robe of dear Richard Harris. The plot stays very true to the book, as best I can remember it. My only nit-picky criticism was the altering of the Hogwarts grounds. Hagrid's hut was definately not in the same location as before, and there were several other anomalies, but as I said, that may be getting pretty nit-picky. Overall, definately 5 stars and definately my favorite Harry Potter movie thus far. <br />
B0002BO0HG|2.0|i like an unusual  and distinctive voice which Antony has, but  it is VERY difficult to listen to for more than a few songs.  he takes the most annoying traits of singers like bryan ferry and nina simone (who are great singers) and sings through them ala a haunted house. i mean to put this in the same category of a genius like Scott Walker is just insanity.  <br /> some of the lyrics are especially cringe-worthy see: \\"I am so very happy, so please hit me\\" from 'cripple..' this may inspire even gay on gay violence.  i mean, i am gay and it makes me cringe and want to throttle him which i don't think was the intention. <br />it is just too precious and pretentious for even people with diverse tastes. live it sometimes works in a small caberetesque setting, but songs like 'hitler..' are just offensive and insensitive to those who lost people to the holocaust. i think there may be something there which i hope has been re-thought for the new cd, but if it's anything like this one - you may want to skip it completely.
B000001EL7|5.0|Still on the roller coaster of success, KISS did what I think the last of the first part of their story, after this CD they start to experience different changes (ups and downs).<br /><br />Some have said this is the last one together and probably is, although in the story says that the last album together is Dynasty. Personally I think this is the last one that they cared about doing it together.<br /><br />I like the sound of the whole album, it's kind of experimental but still fun and rockin'.  With time the only classics that will come out of this one will be \\"I Stole Your Love\\", \\"Love Gun\\", \\"\\"Shock Me\\" and maybe \\"Christine Sixteen\\". I really don't understand why, because they included good songs that maybe if they had played more in concert they would have passed the test of time (\\"Got Love for Sale\\", \\"Tomorrow and Tonight\\").<br /><br />The highlights of the highlights for every fan is that Ace takes over the mic on Shock Me and, personally, I don't think he knew what he was doing but he does his best and something very cool comes out.<br /><br />The cover of \\"Then She Kissed Me\\" is extremely good, too bad they buried it. \\"Hooligan\\" was buried too maybe because it was Peter's.<br /><br />Anyway, I can't say it's the best album from KISS because it's not, but it's on my top ten.<br /><br />Highlight: I Stole Your Love, Shock Me<br /><br />Lowlight: Nothing.
B0000AZKPC|5.0|this is by far the best album from any band that i have ever bought, and i am sincere when i say that. this is coming from someone who does not listen to power metal, because Sonata Arctica is not only for power metal fans. I have listened to this album every single day since i got it about a year ago, and have NEVER even came close to getting tired of it. ive never heard songs that bring a tear to my eye, like \\"kingdom for a heart,\\" \\"unopened\\", and \\"replica.\\" this album has truly changed my view on music and my life.
0385510454|3.0|Like other reviewers I had found some of Grisham's novels in the past few years disappointing in view of the expectations set by great thrillers like The Firm or The Partner.  The Broker sees a return to some of the suspense of those earlier books, though not quite - the chase fizzled out towards the end.  Discovering Italy in the story adds colour - who would not want to be sitting in one of those Trattorias - but the lists of Italian vocabulary get long and are overdone: Grisham traditionalists probably wish he would have spent more time turning the screw of suspense.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This movie is very good, not spirited away but the closest to it so far,  To really understand the whole thng you have to watch it more than once.  The second time it is more enjoyable than the first.

While others are extra beautiful, like \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Love Profusion\\", and \\"Intervention\\". Say you'll never stop making music Madonna!
0783231202|5.0|Let's face it. We go to movies to be entertained. And enlightened. And informed. And all of the other reasons we shell out our hard earned cash. But primarily, we go to movies to be entertained, perhaps for a couple of hours, perhaps to live in a life that is totally not like ours.<br /><br />Much has been said about Amistad, and the glaring, whitewashed history it seems to offer. However, taking history, and blending into a movie is always a tricky business; much of it at the discretion of the producers and director who have one primary motivation: that is, to the story. They must tell a story, story is first. How many times have we sat through a movie with such an unbelievablly weak story, and you've found yourself checking your watch every five minutes for it to end? This doesn't happen at any time with Amistad, Steve Spielberg's retelling of a famous slave revolt on board a Spanish slave ship, and the chilling aftermath. Both brutal and richly drawn, this movie deserved much more praise and acclaim than it received.<br /><br />Amistad introduces us to Cinque, a brash, intelligent man captured into slavery. Smart enough to understand the situation without having to understand English, Cinque organizes a revolt on the ship transporting him to slavery after cunningly breaking free from his chains. The captain tricks the freed slaves by taking them west instead of home to the east, and into jail. As with almost everything in America, the legal system becomes embroiled with these people and their eventual fate.<br /><br />Stellar performances reign in this movie, from the always amazing Morgan Freeman, to the understated performance of Anthony Hopkins at John Q Adams, who eventually represented the Africans in the Supreme Court. However, one performance soars, literally soars over the rest, and the is newcomer Djimon Hounsou. His work is breathtaking as he literally becomes Cinque. The moment when he stands up in court and speaks English for the first time, requesting his freedom, is enough to provoke goosebumps and tears. Why Hollywood hasn't used Hounson more is beyond me.<br /><br />Another unlauded part of this film is the beautifully, haunting score. It's a richly layered musical performance that illuminates the story, while incorporating elements of African music. People say that if you notice things like the music while watching a movie that you really aren't into it; but in this case, you notice the music as an integral part of the masterpiece.<br /><br />When creating a historically based movie, though, you must be given some dramatic license to tell the story the best way possible. If you've ever watched a movie based on an historical event, it's always modified in some ways. Those that aren't are called documentaries. If you want to know the story of Amistad, I highly recommend a wonderful documentary called \\"Voyage of La Amistad: Quest for Freedom\\". There you can learn.<br /><br />Amistad is not a movie that makes you feel good, or makes you feel comfortable. The stain of slavery is dyed permanently into our national fabric, and we, as a nation, need to learn how to deal with this. Amistad takes us a step forward. We must remember. We must remember.

0812550757|5.0|The tale of Ender's Game is sequeled greatly by this book Speaker of the Dead. I like the outside character development of Pipo, Libo, and Novinha where Card uses them well to tie Ender into his whole role in being speaker for the dead. There are times of lag but the over all it pushes through pretty well. I love the series of Ender Wiggins and speaker of the dead is one of Card's best.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|yeah that's right, i said it.  i was not impressed.  maybe it's because i chose not to see the movie right away.  maybe it's because everyone and their mother was telling me i HAD to see it.  maybe it's because my stupid neighbor saw it before i did and loved it.  maybe it was the high school kids i heard quoting the movie when i passed them on the street, i don't know.<br /><br />i think it's because i can think of loads of other movies that don't add content that talks down to me.  i can think of movies with real, legitimate wit and dry humor; movies that aren't so obvious at trying to be \\"different.\\"<br /><br />there were a few funny lines, yes, but for the most part, this movie was a huge disappointment.  huge.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|My husband and I saw the musical in October of 1995 and again in January of 1999. We also purchased the original soundtrack after we saw the musical in 1995 because we loved the music. When my husband saw that it was coming to the movies, he insisted that we go see it. I was hesitant to go see it because I did not think that it would meet my expectations of the musical. Boy, was I wrong. I loved Emmy Rossum she was cast perfectly for the role of Christine. Patrick Wilson brought the part of Raoul to new heights he was fantastic. I have heard many versions of the song, \\"All I Ask of You\\" but I think that Rossum and Wilson's version has unsurpassed them all.  Gerard Butler is breathtaking as the Phantom.  He was charismatic and handsome.  As far as his singing, Butler is not a professional singer and he was given only a certain amount to time to learn how to sing operatic material with that in mind I think that he did a first-rate job.  Minnie Driver brought comic genius to the role of Charlotta.  Miranda Richardson was exceptional in the part of Madam Giry.  After I saw the movie, I was once again in awe and I could not get the music out of my head for weeks.  Last week, I finally got to hear the closing song, \\"Learn to be Lonely\\" performed by Minnie Driver. The song touched me and it really made feel for the Phantom and his solitude.  If the movie is still playing in your area, please do not hesitate to go see it.  As they sing it in the movie, \\"Let the spectacle astound you\\"!  <br />
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Based on the foundations of a classic 'good vs evil' action film, the script further delves into a number of various social\moral conflicts... hence the appropraitely named Collateral.    Most of the social concepts expressed by Cruise are cliche. It reminded me of Fight Club and its analysis of today's consumers, hypnotised by day time Tv, and depressed from unaccomplished dreams. Brad Pitt's tutorial on society's flaws are similarly questioned by Cruise, in an 'in your face, lawless, im too cool' fashion.     Also, the characters and plot interwind in a similar fashion to \\"HEAT\\", the director's previous work. Where good and evil come to understand each other, leaving a bitter sweet fight off at the end.     There is no doubt that Tom Cruise is a multidimensional actor, his role is convincing enough, once you get passed the grey hair and baby smooth skin. But I'd like to see him step outside the cool, charasmatic self and really give us next level performance. Funny, enough... I thought he was going to say \\"ill be back\\" at one stage on the train!    Overall, it was an okay movie, soon to be forgotten. Had they pondered more on the REAL complexities of good vs evil, this movie could have had more impact, instead it came off somewhat predicatable, mundane and already said.
B0002YLC24|3.0|Remember in the film Waking Life, when we see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy together?  I figured that the couple from Before Sunrise ended up together. <br /> <br />Not so. <br /> <br />It is nine years later and the Ethan Hawke character has written a book about his one-night love affair.  He is doing a signing at Shakespeare & Co. in Paris when he finally meets Julie Delpy again.  This movie is very much in the same spirit as the other one: these two characters talk and talk and talk.  The gimmick of this film is that it takes place in \\"real time\\": Ethan Hawke has about an hour-and-a-half to kill before his plane takes off and we spend every second with those two characters.  (Thank goodness neither of them had to go to the bathroom.)  In that time, we find out why they didn't get together and how their lives are turning out.  The surprising thing is how unattractive Ethan Hawke has turned out - he is now gaunt with bad teeth (perhaps Uma put a curse on him).   <br /> <br />This film is a little less good than its predecessor.  In Before Sunrise there was more at stake: this couple was meeting each other for the first time, the spent the whole day together, there was more of a sense of possibility.  In Before Sunset, these characters are less free - they are being consumed by their lives.  This film also ends on an enigmatic but upbeat note.  If you enjoyed the first one, you will enjoy the second.  However, if these two meet again in another ten years, I don't think I'll care any more.   <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. I thought for sure that this album couldn't live up to the hype, but it most certainly exceeds, if anything. When I listen to it, I just want to get up and jump around, or conquer the world I'm not sure which. Energizing, positive without being smarmy... BRILLIANT!
B000286S8S|4.0|I have been a van halen fan since 1978.I loved the band,david lee roth rocked and i was sad when he was out of the band.Sammy came in and it was great,but then there was gary cherone and years of nothing from the band.very dissapointing.The problem with the best of both worlds is although there are great tunes on it the 3 new songs are crap.I also wished the band had done new material instead of a hastily thrown together greatest hits compilation.Hopefully the band will put together a new studio work that rocks . As greatest hits cd's go best of both worlds is missing something.Even so i am glad i have it as some of the tunes really rock and are faves of mine. For a greatest hits cd i would say it's a buy only if you are a die hard vh fan.
6305511055|5.0|An archetypal 70's cerebral CIA thriller.  This slow-paced cinematic effort from Sydney Pollack is mostly gripping, but marred by two plot holes.  The first is the seeming inability of the CIA to compare the two bullets in the alley shooting -- and discover that they were fired by two different pistols.  Oops; I guess that would have taken the focus of guilt off of Redford's character too early in the story.  The second hole is the inexplicable reason why Faye Dunaway's character would so quickly submit to the charm of Redford's character, after being kidnapped.  A classic example of internalized oppression in women -- in a world where men get what they want, and women too realize the power structure through their own self-imposed subjugation.  Other than that, a fine piece of escapism.
B00000FCBC|2.0|They got the cd title wrong, for it should of been garbage inc. You know a band gets lazy when the cd is practically made full of covers. The covers they picked for the most part were mediocre songs, or were they just trying to pick out the easier songs? There are good points on the cd, like Whiskey in a Jar, and some others.  Unfortunally, it is mostly filled with stinkers. it's a mediocre album, not in any way in comparrison with Ride the Lightning or Puppets. <br />   kirt Hammet has potentially good solos, but the problem is he abuses his wah. I feel like I should of stole it from him in the studio so I wouldn't <br />hear it now. Usually Hammet, out of all his solos, usually has 2 or 3 decent or good ones on a album. There was like 1 decent solo on this album, and I believe that was played by Hetfield!  And Hetfield is more limiting I think now with his E F E F approach. Branch out more guys. Was this the cd that Metallica was complaning about Napster people downloading? Maybe if you would look at the price tag it would help, it's not worth it. <br />     However, you will miss this album if you ever have to hear St Anger. I heard there making a new album, please go in the right direction or retire.
078322737X|2.0|Set in 1962, this coming of age story for California guys showcases the pop world from a male perspective.  In a dusk-to-dawn marathon, the guys face their respective rites of passage -- when boys supposedly turn into \\"men.\\"  This film got one thing right about the 60's: the \\"goils\\" simply exist as foils or fluffy fantasy fodder for the male gaze.<br /><br />The film is a classic example of author Inez Hedge's central thesis in her book \\"Breaking the Frame\\" where she explores film language and the experience of cinematic limits.  In general, film viewers are rarely shown what occurs inside the minds of the female characters.  Women exist as subjects within a frame that assumes the male perspective.  Women's passive positioning in film language is reinforced by two directorial tactics:  1)  most point-of-view shots are taken from a male perspective;  2) males originate most of the action.<br /><br />As another man for feminism, I'm perplexed as to why so many readers fail to find value in this honest assessment.  I'm not knocking George Lucas in general; he was brilliant in THX 1138, but in this follow up flick, he caved in to Hollywood.
B000286SCO|5.0|This is by far there greatest live work. A must have for the DT fan. It is a bit different from there studio work, but that's what makes it great. You really see what these musicians can do live and in the moment. <br />      I am a big fan of Music DVD's, and I must say this live performance ranks up there with SRV:Live in Austin etc. It's a nice cd too, but when you see the show go down, it's a whole experience. if you already have the cd, I still encourage you to check this out.
B0000024R8|5.0|Like many others, i got familiar with Bob D. through albums such as Highway 61, Blood, B.O.B., Bringing it home, Freewheelin`and later Desire and Times. I`d read somewhere that the debut album was mediocre and much weaker than Freewheelin, which was supposed to represent a huge leap forward both career-wise and artistically.  <br />Having heard and for the most part hated (although there are one or two good songs on any BD album) other `mediocre`albums such as Down in the groove and At Budokan, I shunned this one for a long time. After all, for a budding Dylan collector, there are a LOT of classics to buy, and being a poor highschool student, I had to make priorities.  <br />So when I finally bought it, it was a spontaneous buy, just seemed nice to own the very first Dylan album, even if it wasn`t supposed to be very good... <br />Suffice to say, I was totally overwhelmed by it. Here are a few facts that the general record-buying public should know, but generally don`t know about it: <br /> <br />1.`Bob Dylan` has some of the best vocal work and guitar playing Dylan ever did. <br /> <br />2.It is bursting by the seems with a ferocious ENERGY (Freewheelin is much quieter and, frankly, more boring) <br /> <br />3.It contains distilled hoopla-Americana of a kind that you`ll have a hard time finding anywhere else. <br /> <br />4.It predates heavy metal-listen to his voice in Fixin`to die when he goes \\"There`s black smoke risin`,Lord, it`s risin`up above my head, UP ABOVE MY HEAD.. <br /> <br />5.His version of `House of the rising sun`is the definitive one, full of emotion, copied but not bettered by The Animals. <br /> <br />6.`Song to Woody`is actually maybe the worst song on the album. <br /> <br />7.On `Freight train blues` Dylan holds a single note (blu-huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuues...) longer than he ever did, ever! :) <br /> <br />8.Unlike the detached, satirical/knowing singing style he was to develop later, here he is sometimes overwhelmed by emotion. On `See thatmy grave is kept clean`, he manages to convey a true dread and fear of dying that is down-to-earth, private and scary. <br /> <br />9. It is obvious that he is singing without any pressure from fans/the Movement/himself. This album is a rare oppurtunity to hear Dylan at his most liberated and free. <br /> <br />10.You should buy it.
B00003CXC7|5.0|James Stewart and Grace Kelly make a wonderful couple in this film. The mystery keeps you guessing until the end. While the focus is out the rear window of Stewart's New York City apartment, his relationship with Grace Kelly's socialite progresses and changes. My favorite aspect about this movie is the juxtapostioning of Stewart learning about his neighbors as he watches them with him seeing new aspects of his girlfriend's adventurous spirit that he didn't know existed.
0316666343|5.0|This book has been a wonderful release for me from the agony of turning through william faulkner or charles dickens in school. This book was what got me back in to loving to read. It was thoroughly entertaining and made me cry more than once. The only bad thing about it is you will get distracted from anything else but reading.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Quite possibly the most epic collection of science fiction stories ever made, it is the brilliantly designed brainchild of creator George Lucas. Telling the tale of the evil senator palpatine's rise to power and the legacy of the Skywalker family, you are wintered into a world where numerous aliens, planets, vehicles, droids, weapons, technology, and culture of a galaxy far, far away wrap your greatest imaginations in amazement.<br /><br />Episode IV: A New Hope - There's a lot of things I could say about this film, but I'm pretty sure most of you reading this have already seen this movie. The special effects are fantastic for this film even by today's standards, and the character development in this film is one of the best I've seen in years. The story will have you on an epic adventure of many proportions, so it's no wonder this film is still remembered even today. Although there are certain story elements that aren't really original and the story can get predictable at times, it doesn't ruin this film. George Lucas does a great job directing this film and has the story and special effects work together beautifully; the soundtrack for this film is superb. With so many great memorable scenes like the showdown between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader or the classic flight scene with Luke Skywalker. This movie will have you cheering and begging for more after it's finished.<br /><br />Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back - The story gets a little darker with this film and has some very surprising plot twists. This movie not only surpasses the original, but is a great movie in its own right. The acting, directing, cinematography, musical score, and special effects are great, and compliment the story quite well. This movie will have on an emotional roller coaster that'll leave you gasping for more. With epic scenes like the showdown between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader or the tragic end Han Solo faces in this film, it's no wonder why this film is considered the best out of all the Star Wars films.<br /><br />Episode VI: Return of the Jedi - What can I say about this third film? It's another masterpiece in movie history. The story can get a little cheesy at times with the ewoks and a bit predictable, but it doesn't ruin the experience. George Lucas not only produced a great story, but he also delivered another great musical score and special effects to back it up. The original Star Wars trilogy is one of the best movie series of all time with great moments like the final confrontation Luke has with Darth Vader and the Emperor or the touching love story with Princess Leia and Han Solo, so this movie series never stops being interesting. A true classic for any movie fan.<br /><br />Overall, the original trilogy is truly a masterpiece.<br /><br />My favorite character in this trilogy is definitely Han Solo.<br />He's got this cocky, bad ass attitude that I like.<br /><br />I first seen these when my dad bought the trilogy on laserdisc in 1995.<br />I loved these after since I watched them for the first time.<br /><br />After seeing the ORIGINAL films, this DVD box set took awhile to grow on me.<br />As I watched Episode IV, I adapted to the changes.<br />The picture and sound are phenomenal.

B000002KDG|5.0|Everything Neil Young does is at least interesting and worthy of a listen, but the high points in his career are must-haves. This is one of those high points.  The strange, bittersweet acoustic tales start it off, then the pounding Crazy Horse style that made Neil Young a punk icon brings it to a head.  <br /> <br />It's even better on vinyl!
B00003CX5P|4.0|I seen this in theatres in 1999. In any case, I believe it to be a good movie, even if it wasn't as good as the original trilogy. The graphics are better in this movie than the originals, but what are you to expect with the time difference? The Pod race was awesome too. Jake Lloyd (the kid who played Anakin) cannot act to save his life, therefore the film suffers with the scenes he's in.<br /><br />Here's the biggest problems: How do you have better technology in the past then you do in the future? If I remember right, Episode I takes place at least 30 years before Episode IV. Why do you have an animal pulling something that can levitate, they can figure out how to levitate something but they can't figure out how to move it from point A to point B? George Lucas has such a big ego that he had to showoff how great he is and make this movie so over the top with special effects that it makes the originals look dated instead of making the new movies flow into the old movies.
B000089CPF|5.0|I really love this album.  Calexico has a distinctive sound and they stick to it. Jazzy drums, nylon guitar, mariachi horns, pedal steel, reverbish twang, it all just comes together in a neat sonic package.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|Loved Bourne Identity.  Sorry, but found this film a pain to sit through.  I call it the wandering camera technique -- why some directors insist on using it I will never know.  But the constant shaking of the camera I find irritating to the point I get physically nauseous.  So very many people with whom I have chatted have expressed a similar irritation at this camera technique.  Get the camera back on its sticks (tripod), please!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly could have been one of the greatest shows in television history.  Alas, we'll never know, because the network killed it. But we can see enough in this complete collection to see how great it COULD have been. <br /> <br />Compelling characters make for compelling stories, and Joss Whedon has always specialized in great characters.  Watch it!
B0000026J1|3.0|To start off this is not a great album, but it is better than today's music which is utter trash. John Norum left the band and in comes Kee Marchello on guitar. The sound as changed since other Europe albums. This is their most mellow work.Their first 3 albums were the best, this one falls into the background for me. <br />1.Superstitious(8/10)Not a bad song,kinda catchy tune. <br />2.Let the Good Times Rock(8/10)Solid track, decent party anthem. <br />3.Open Your Heart(7/10)Starts out slow, but picks up with some good guitar work and nice melody. <br />4.More than meeets the eye(7/10)Decent rocker.Guitars and keyboards blend suberbly. <br />5.Coast to Coast(4/10)A poor attempt to remake their 1986 song Carrie. Not well done at all.Guitar solo is good though in the middle. <br />6.Ready or Not(8/10)Good guitar heavy song this time. <br />7.Sign of the Times(8/10)Solid song. Keyboards are catchy and good guitar work.Cool chorus. <br />8.Just the beginning(7/10)Not Bad. <br />9.Never Say Die(5/10)Pretty bad song. Didn't like it at all. <br />10.Lights and Shadows(5/10)Another song that's not good. <br />11.Tower's Callin(7/10)Decent song. <br />12.Tomorrow(4/10)Another attempt at a ballad chart buster.It dosen't work!
B0006J28BO|4.0|As habitually late high schooler Haru is walking down the street with her friend, she saves a cat from becoming a traffic fatality. Imagine her surprise when the cat stands up on two legs and speaks to her, thanking her for saving his life and that Haru will be repaid for her heroic deed. Unfortunately, her reward comes in the form of mice being stuffed in her locker, having catnip stuck in her pocket, causing her to be stalked by neighborhood strays. In addition, she learns that the cat she rescued is the prince of the Cat Kingdom, and his father, the Cat King, threatens to kidnap her and make her marry his son. A mysterious voice tells her to seek out the Cat Bureau for help in escaping this unenviable situation. That's where she'll meet the mysterious Baron, his overweight and crabby cat partner Muta, and the crow named Toto, of all things. They just might be the only help she'll get in this world. <br /> <br />The Cat Returns, while bearing the Studio Ghibli mark, is actually directed by Hiroyuki Morita, in an effort of the studio to bring up new talent for its rapidly aging patriarchs. Morita does a more than adequate job of making his entertaining, enchanting, and whimsical first feature. The main character of Haru is given a life of her own, filled with nuance and naturalism. From the opening shots she seems like a real person, from the jumping out of bed late to her looking in the mirror twice to see how she looks. The anime characters in this film are better than live actors. I also liked the fact that Cat was lighthearted and never sank into the end of the world scenarios that some Ghibli movies suffer from. Beneath the surface of it, the movie is really about a girl trying to figure out where she belongs and seeking to find a place that excites her soul beyond her everyday life. <br /> <br />There's a slightly too detailed self-important documentary on the making of Cat Returns, chronicling the setup for the show as if it were the Battle of Waterloo. Alsohas interviews with the main English voice talent, including Cary Elwes and Peter Boyle and Japanese trailers. The 2nd disc in this set is a complete waste of space to me, since it consists only of a story-boarded version of the movie. I mean, that is probably neat to filmmakers but to a slightly normal person like me, it is a disk that will never be viewed. They should have included the feature Whisper of the Heart or something on the second disk. <br />
B00005IC2H|5.0|Read the title.  <br /> <br />What more do I have to say?! <br /> <br />Sigur Ros is more than just a group of Icelandic weirdos playing their guitars with violin bows. They are oh so much more. They've taken emotions, actual emotions, put them in song form, and somehow shoved them into the pits and lands onto the back of a CD. This CD is an emotional journey unlike any other. If this were one hundred dollars, and had the two best songs on it, i'd still buy it. I might even buy it twice out of spite for people who don't buy it.  <br /> <br />I'm not even going to bother saying anymore. Putting Sigur Ros into words thus far has been hard enough.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is one of the best war-time novels that exists.  Not only does it contain the type of comedy that can only come out of ridiculous army regulations and stereotypes but it contains a message thats important for all of us to address.  It brings up the point that war has no point.  We kill eachother for no reason and this book is about a man stuck in the middle.  Yossarian is the kind of man we can look up to, he understands whats going on in the world and how he cannot do anything but run for his life.  Although the movie was better, because of the explosions, this book was very entertaining and the characters and plot of the book are well rounded.
0446530891|2.0|Not the quality of writing that Baldacci has exhibited in his earlier books.  This read like one long very confusing and unbelievable conversation.  As another reviewer said, when spread out over multiple sittings, the plot became more tangled in your mind. In the end, we are supposed to believe that all of the events that happened were for the purpose of fulfilling one man's fantasy.  All in all, the book just didn't read right.  I don't think David Baldacci can honestly say this was his best effort.  Don't waste your money; if you must read it, get it from the library or the used books section. It's selling there for 33 cents; that's about what it's worth.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|When i first watched this movie, i thought that it would be a so so movie or like some would say.. a mediocre movie. However from the time i put the movie on, i couldn't stop watching it, at the time of watching it it doesn't seem like such a great movie, but after it s over and you start to reflect about it and think of the possibilities that if it happened in real life it would be somewhat similar. If you start to think of the little details about the movie and most of the details connect( like how during his childhood he's having those black outs setting the opportunity for him to go back in time and figure out what happened during that time). It is really a good movie if you give it the chance, nice story line, good actors. To make it easier on everyone, i m going to say it like this... if you like movies about time travel or the philosophy of changing ones past and future, then this is the movie for you, if you re just an action junkie, you will probably not like it.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|These are tough times in our country, culturally.  During the past 4 years, (and I'm afraid for at least the next 4 years), we've been experiencing a cultural wasteland - a time when we get advertisements shoved at us at the movie theaters, most movies (particularly American) have no content whatsoever and demand nothing from the audience (if they are even watchable, which is rare!), when TV is populated by vapid reality shows or propaganda masquerading as news, where black is white, lies are the truth.  I am sure some day we will look back and wonder how we lost our way so completely.  Yet, out of the murk comes this wonderful piece of music by a group of musicians that clearly believe that art is meant to challenge the people.  No, its not little empty sound bites.  Yes, it takes time to absorb...it demands and rewards repeated listens.  The reward is over an hour of creativity, joy, and an experience that is life-enriching.  I've only listened to this CD 4-5 times, but I connected with it immediately.  It is the first piece of new music that I've craved in a very long time.  I own everything Pat Metheny has recorded, discovering him while at Graduate school back in 1978, starting with the White Album....I've seem him in concert over a dozen times.  Though I enjoy all of his music, this is the PMG album that I've been waiting for since The First Circle - since that CD, with the exception of Secret Story, I've felt that there is so much more for him/his group to say than his recent CDs have shown.  And, this CD proves it.  Challenge yourself, take some quality time and spend it with this music.  Your life will be better for it.    Having listened a few more times after posting the above, here are a few signposts for working through the piece:    Opening/Part 1:    From the start till about 37 second in is an interesting pulse which reminds me very much of the music of Steve Reich, especially in his Music for 18 Musicians on ECM (in fact, there are echoes of severalECM artists in this CD; I read that Pat and the group listened through their entire catalog prior to making this CD...I wonder if they also listened to a sampling of the better known ECMs as well!).    The rest of the opening, running through to about 4:20, presents a series of themes, some of which will be repeated later on - layered guitar, some harmonica, a very retro sounding synth line (American Garage vintage?!), a bit of doubling harmonica, and some distorted slide guitar.    There is a lovely acoustic guitar interlude at 4:20; at 5:15 the next episode begins with what sounds like a Kalimba - a distorted lead guitar solo follows, with doubling trumpet and occasionally harmonica.  A key climax point happens in the section that runs between 8:25 and 10:25 - a very complex part.  A second climax occurs during a call and response section with the trumpet between 10:25 and 11:25.    The music calms and takes a breath between 11:25 and 14:00 - after a percussive effect, there is a new theme on acoustic guitar, with harmonica doubling, then trumpet tripling, and includes a nice acoustic piano solo.    After a different acoustic effect at 14:00 - reminding me of Steve Tibbetts - a long section of straight jazz ensues - with a few varying episodes in between.  The first few minutes, with solo guitar and following trumpet, are very Kenny Wheeler-like.  An acoustic interlude reminds me of Eberhard Weber, another great ECM artist - then a section that completely blows me away, the unison runs of guitar and trumpet between 16:20 and 17:20...after a bit more acoustic guitar and Kalimba comes more swinging jazz, guitar with doubling harmonica - great bass playing - a fine piano solo, then a trumpet solo, a synth guitar solo which, at 26:10, moves into a beautiful acoustic guitar solo (reminds me of early Pat)...a few more changes between previously introduced themes and fast runs ends in a rare but very effective drum solo as this section ends at 31:45.    Part 2 has an unusual opening - plucked acoustic chords with a Weber-like bass line, a mournful trumpet solo, then a section that almost reminds me of Solstice vintage Ralph Towner.  At 3:40, a stunning calm section ensues with lovely piano soloing over pulsing acoustic guitar, very spare indeed.  Then, at 6:30, rapid pulsing begins, trumpet comes in...this is the most playful, loud section, with trumpet and distorted electric guitars, bass thrusts, guitar synth - all delightfully chaotic and abstract.  At 12:00, back to fingered acoustic chords with an almost Berimbau effect - reminding of Nana Vasconcelos and the Wichita CD - then a superb, long harmonica solo (13:00-17:50) - which moves abruptly into a syncopated transition which takes us to the end of part 2.    Part 3 is the shortest portion, and really sets out to resolve the whole - there are nice solos on guitar, piano, guitar synth, bowed bass - then for the first time wordless vocals circa the song The First Cirle, which pulls everything together.  At 7 minutes, we return to acoustic guitar, peacefulness, ambient sounds, and echoes of all that has gone on before...    Throughout there is amazing complexity and layering - subliminal effects, distant traffic noise, scrapings on guitar strings, solo lines passing to any number of guitars - giving listeners to much to absorb, and guaranteeing that there will always be something to discover in this piece.    What a journey!
0316666343|3.0|After the hype of many friends, I picked this book up.   <br /> <br />It is indeed a fast, easy read that you find yourself not wanting to put down, but the drive to find out \\"what happens next\\" is not always the hallmark of greatness.  <br /> <br />Some descriptions drag on a la John Steinbeck, but without his skill and depth.  It seems as if the writer took a wonderful poignant short story or novella and stretch it into a full length novel but without adding any more meat to its bones. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the basic concept is brilliant, the lessons touching, and the characters real.  But what was the purpose of the extra 50 pages or so?  What possibly was added by the \\"coming of age\\" scene referenced by one of the other reviewers here (but which I won't spoil)?   <br /> <br />I'm sure Ms. Sebold will continue to hit the Best Seller list, but in 30 years no one will remember this book.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I posit that the strong positive and negative reactions to this movie are generational.<br /><br />Colleges are having weekend \\"Napoleon\\" film festivals.  Virtually every kid at my kid's high school has seen this movie at least twice. There is something here.<br /><br />I remember high school.  Even though I'm fifty, it really wasn't that long ago.  There were kids like Napoleon and Pedro.  What went through their minds? Why did they have to put up with the jocks and those perky cheerleader student government types?  Gaaa, what idiots!  (Hit that \\"unhelpful\\" button.  Go on.  Geeez.)<br /><br />So, thou one star reviewers, you are either OLD, or you were a student government type, or went to private school where everyone is perfect. This is how it is (or was).<br /><br />Sure the film has flaws, but  I was not crazy about the LaFonda interlude, or the tidy ending, but the macho American-flag martial arts instructor had me in stiches for a week.  I had an ex-brother in law who reminded me a lot of the Tupperware salesman. I felt the film was trying to be more episodic than plot driven, which is legitimate.<br /><br />Other off-beats:  \\"American Splendor\\" \\"Crumb\\", \\"Ghost World\\"
B0006OBPTA|5.0|I'm not going to go into a review for this film... plenty of people before me have explained what the movie is about and why it is good.  All I have to say is that I went to Target tonight looking for nothing in particular, and I happenstance came across this in the box-set dvd section.  The last time I watched the Karate Kid, it was on VHS, and it was years ago. But when I saw the ENTIRE set on DVD... my friend can tell you. I stopped, started sputtering, pointing... finally I managed to get out, \\"Dude! Dude! Dude! ... HOLY! DUDE. OH MY GOD. DUDE!!! The Karate Kid! I love this movie! This is the whole reason I took karate in the first place! I wanted to be Daniel-san! And then I WAS Daniel-san! And I kicked ass!!\\" <br /> <br />My friend couldn't stop laughing. <br /> <br />Anyway. I just wanted to say that Karate Kid is the good stuff. The \\"believe in yourself, never give up, find the courage to face the darker moments of life\\" stuff. Every body needs a little bit of Daniel-san in them. <br /> <br />I wish I had some sake so I could salute Mr. Myagi.  <br />\\"BONZAAAIIIII!!!!!\\"
0446677450|4.0|Change my rating to 3 star. This poorly written and apparently unedited book contains many valuable nuggets of financial wisdom. Kiyosaki tells you how to think and what to do in order to become wealthy. You'll have to suffer through his repetitive writing style, but he shares some solid things worth knowing. It's a worthwhile read for anyone wanting to outperform the low expectations they assimilated from their working class family.
B00006L83N|5.0|What an outstanding band. You need to purchase this as well as their entire collection. These guys put Dream Theater to shame. These guys know when to hold back...they don't go too far, although the drummer does repeat that chuca chuca rythm too much. Nevertheless, this is ear candy: great arrangements, great singing, great music!  I almost took off a star for the chuca chuca factor - can get annoying sometimes. But their melodies are absolutely PROG GOD LIKE. The Odyssey is an amazing piece of music. Accolade II is unbelievable. Highly reccommended except for some of the drumming.
068484267X|5.0|The greatest aspect of Angela's Ashes is that you feel like Frank McCourt really put himself in that book. The narrator really is him.  Unlike most memoirs, you get the sense that you are sitting with McCourt at a table and he's telling you his story.  You can tell he's being facetious, you're not sure all of the story is exactly how it happened, but you don't care because the story is so good and the message he's trying to deliver is so honest that it doesn't really matter.  The narrator and the author just happen to be natural born storytellers and they tell it to you the way they felt it because sometimes that's more honest than telling you the way it was.<br /><br />With most other memoirs you get the sense that they don't share seem to have any feelings about any of the events happening.  The author, of course, felt the story because he's the one being written about, but somehow they never place those feelings in the mouth (or words) of the narrator.  The book might as well have been written by a biographer.<br /><br />But McCourt writes in his own voice.  And you can almost feel him reliving these stories as he tells you about them.  At one minute, he's crying over heartbreak and the next he's laughing at the irony spread throughout the story of his life.<br /><br />When he's at his best, he is laughing with you at the child he once was, the beliefs he once had.<br /><br />The book is terrific, but I don't have to tell you that because you already know.
B00064MW6A|5.0|Move over, Eartha Kitt!  Just when you thought Miss Halle Berry couldn't get any better in \\"Monster's Ball,\\" she stars in \\"Catwoman,\\" and girlfriend is TOO FIERCE in this movie!  Halle and I have lots in common: we're beautiful, talented, and look fabulous in leather outfits.  My only complaint is that they didn't make this as S&M-ish as it could have been.  Otherwise, it's a great movie with one of my favorite actresses EVER!

B000001ESP|5.0|I've loved this album from beginning to end for the better part of my existence. It is the last \\"raw\\" rock album Rush put out before they started getting heavy into elctronica. If you really want to hear what Neil, Geddy, and Alex can do, this is a wonderful place to start. Unlike most of the people who have rated this album, my favorite tune is \\"Camera Eye\\", it's a kick-ass 8 minute joy to listen to and extremely fun to play (I'm a bass player). You'll love this album. Oops! I mean CD.
B00008BXJF|5.0|I was a little dissapointed with Thrak and their last album. This album however is great and suggests this band has a lot to offer yet. Fripp and Belew do a great job and the rythm section is also very interesting. Progressive rock at its absolute finest. It seems Fripp was a little bit more up front and aggressive on this album instead of atmospheric frippotonic. Great to hear old pompous Robert jammin' like the \\"Red\\" days.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|Both critics and audiences loved Bridget Jones diary and there are variety of reasons why:  <br /> <br />Bridget Jones character ups and downs resembles both men and women in their early 30's:  <br /> <br />Both men and women at this age, are contemplating  <br />their status in life.  <br /> <br />Their bummed out because they haven't met that  special someone, or they are bummed out, because throughout their life, they have met only losers  who are wasting their time  (which I very familiar with, except in my case, I've met mostly shallow women while the nice, beautiful girls are all taken.)  <br /> <br />However, it's just romantic life that is  troubling people like Bridget Jones, contemplation about their careers and family are coming toward  the forefront of their life.  <br /> <br />Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger)  is a British publishing assistant  who works for a publishing agency. She has a poor excuse of a lady boss and a male boss.  <br /> <br />The whole film is narrated through the young, and  witty and vivacious eyes of Bridget Jones.  We learn how she feels about many people in her life, and we get to know Bridget on a very personal level, which is one of the reasons the film is highly acclaimed so much.  <br /> <br />Anyhow, Bridget's male is Daniel Cleaver (played  as brilliant ridiculous as ever by Hugh Grant).  Ever since Mr. Grant made the fatal mistake of  picking up a prostitute, he's been ridiculed  (rightly so ) by the media, but he's also benefited  from it. He's played degenerate, characters for most  <br />of his career, and the audience loves it.  <br /> <br /> <br />Daniel, comes across as a very sly and romantic, and often blatanly horny boss, who wants Bridget, even going as far as sending her, really provocative emails.  <br /> <br />Bridget (she has a young nieve mind) falls for  Daniel's (ahem) charms and starts seeing him,  <br />unbeknowst to Bridget what kind of man, Daniel.  This changes though, when Bridget meets a family  <br/>called Mark Darcy (Colin Firth)  , who constantly seems to be meeting  Bridget at family gatherings.  <br />Bridget and Mark Darcy seem to have a hate relationship.  He himself is rude, arrogant, and ridiculous at  <br />times.  <br /> <br />However, it's revealed that Mark also likes Bridget, and Bridget has the tough decision of  <br />deciding which man to really give her heart.  As you can see the story is very real to the lives  of real women both in Britain and US.  <br /> <br />Unfortunanetly though, once a woman makes the decision that Bridget makes, she is pretty much  <br />stuck with her decision for most of her life.  <br /> <br />The Dvd comes loaded with a bunch of extra features, in fact, if you haven't seen the movie,  <br />I extremely encourage to watch the dvd and not the  vhs, since the DVD will give so many great items  <br />to watch including:  <br /> <br />* 2 music videos for the DVD  <br />*Deleted Scenes!!!!  <br />* Special Commentary  <br />*Trailers  <br />*Actual columns written by the real Bridget Jones  <br />and much more!!  <br />
1400082773|2.0|I had to read this book for one of my school classes. I was interested in this book because I thought it would be interesting to read what this man has gone through. Yet when I started reading, there was nothing exciting or gripping to make me read on. Obama manages to write 4 pages on the morals behind a lady that wore colored contacts one day. It has nothing to do with the story and makes you lose attention. It gets interesting when Obama hears who his father really was. But immidiately after that, the interest is lost.  <br />I myself have not lived in America during the time of this book, and am not an African American. This book doesn't say much to me.  <br />Finally I think that he should have spend more time discussing his mother and the influences she had on his life. <br />I wouldn't recommend this book if you do not like books that sometimes lose track of the main plot.
B00069YE0W|4.0|This album is perfectly named because, as I listen to it, I just see myself sitting in a big white bed and watching the \\"Curtains\\" flap from the cool wind from the window. <br /> <br />This album is very happy, sad, and moving. <br /> <br />One thing that has struck me about Inside of Emptiness, Curtains, DC-EP, and The Will to Death, is how there are songs on there that are very weak and I do not care for at all, this makes up about 40% of his newer songs.  It may just be my taste though, so you should listen for yourself. <br /> <br />Well enough talking about the bad things, because there is so much good to be said as well, here are my favorite(greatest to least) <br /> <br />1. Sphere In The Heart Of Silence (very cool, awesome expirmental music on here) <br />2. Curtains (moving and beautiful) <br />3. Automatic Writing (deep and very different) <br />4. Inside of Emptiness (a few cool rocking songs on here) <br />5. DC-EP (I do not suggest :/ except for the song Dissolve) <br />6. Will to Death (Ug)
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Despite the impressive special effects this film seems almost to determined to do more and comes up with less.  The plot line is fairly uncomplicated the actors seem trapped in a lack luster play with bad scripts and bad jokes.  I couldn't help feeling that I was watching a combination of James Bond movies set in a 1930's sci-fi serial.  Far too many plot lines were left hanging and unexplained. In general this film is fun to watch for all of the hints to classic movies from the 1930's and even up to the laser duel from recent Star Wars movies.  Overall this could have been a real classic had more attention to plot, acting and scripting been applied.  As it is, it comes out as a low \\"B\\" class movie with high budget effects but no real substance, a pity as it could have been really something.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|When I saw this film in theaters I was completely blown away with it.  Before I even went to see it, I was impressed with the perfect casting of four actors whom I really enjoy watching on film:  Julia Roberts (as Anna), Natalie Portman (as Alice), Jude Law (as Dan), and Clive Owen (as Larry).  This one is really dialogue heavy in a way that pulls you in and never lets go.  Among the four actors, I think Natalie Portman pretty much owns this picture and her recent Golden Globe was well deserved (I hope she repeats on Sunday by nabbing the Best Supporting Actress Oscar).  The scenes of her in a private room of a strip club, bending her body in imaginative and seductive ways while still carrying on an intense and sexually charged conversation with Larry is an amazing scene for me.  To watch this film and \\"Garden State\\", you will be convinced that Natalie Portman is the actress of her generation and will only grow from here. <br /> <br />Clive Owen is also great in this film and his character of Larry is the most conniving of the four.  The movie works to a brilliant resolution, in which is wicked knowledge of Anna's psychology is used to set up a rival for his former flame's affections (Dan).  Payback is a b...., as they say and well deserved in the case of pathetic Dan, who toys with people's emotions, pretending to be who he's not, especially in the Internet chatroom. <br /> <br />While some people might not find any of the characters sympathetic or like the idea that people in relationships lie to one another, but I find a lot of what happens in this film to be true to life, in my own observations of people.  To live a completely honest life means one is going to be stepped on, taken advantaged of, and discarded when no longer convenient.  This film should serve as a wake up call to anyone that it sometimes takes cunning to win at the game of love.  The pathetic aspect of love is that no one wants to get hurt, yet too many don't see the hurt they cause in others.This film is a brilliant case example, with top notch performances across the board. <br /> <br />I'm shocked that one reviewer below called this film gay without the courage to state so at the end.  That's one interpretation, though I suppose it reveals more about the reviewer than anything else.  I certainly didn't get that impression from the film. <br /> <br />See this film and hopefully it will inspire you to be honest in your dealings with other people...especially the ones you love the most.
B00005JLTM|3.0|As special effects go, MR topped the first film however as far as story, character development, and suspense, MR was really mediocre, and I can say this because I am a Matrix fan but also a movie critic who is aware when a sequel is just made for the big bucks. The Wachowski brothers, really giving a damn if they really delivered a good film. I mean it's like the George Lucas thing I've mentioned a dozen times on here, the directors can make a somewhat average film with awesome special effects and get away because they know they're is going to be a bunch of fans going to see the movie   just to see the effects,stuff blow up, and cleavege. <br /> <br />Ok MR is the sequel to the 1999 Matrix where a young hacker named Neo (Keanu Reeves) is chosen to be the one in a computer generated world mingling with reality. Neo is told to ''he is the one'' by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his leather wearing sexy friend Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). At the of the Matrix becomes aware of his superpowers and realizes that he is the one, and learns briefly of the history of Zion and it's enemies,including mechanical insects called ''The Osiris'' (who also make a brief return in this sequel.  <br /> <br />Now fast forward to the MR and we know get a look at the city of Zion that Morpheus was talking about. However, trouble lurks when Morpheus learns that the Osiris are making a return to crush the city. Morpheus prepares the city for battle with a bunch of cliched speeches, however he also wants to contact the Oracle to see if the prophecy for Zion and Neo will be fullfilled and thus end the war for Zion. Meanwhile, Neo has now grasps and flaunts his special powers as the one which include flying (yes like Superman, God how original lol), expertise in the martial arts. However prior to this in a badly staged but entertaining scene Neo has a long vision of Trinity invading a building and blowing up with a motorcycle, while she makes a nice squat landing. : -0 What Genius!!! His vision ends terribly know when he sees that Trinity is fatally wounded in midair by one the computer clone agents of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). Neo pushes aside the incident for the moment, but does not forget it.  <br /> <br />So now we begin with some of the cheesy cliches in the film including the public speech Morpheus gives to the Zion citizens to fight the Osiris:  <br /> <br />Morpheus ''Tonight let them remember this is Zion and we are not afraid'' (queue up the Extras for a loud roar. LMAO).  <br /> <br />So Neo and Morpheus eventually leave Zion to meet the Oracle while the Zion forces prepare for the situation of the Osiris however problems arise again when the Oracle (a worthless character play a worthless actress) tells them that their problems with the prophecy of Neo.  <br /> <br />So then Neo meets the allknowing Oracle (Gloria Foster) and finds out how idiotic she is LOL  <br /> <br />Neo: ''I suppose the obvious questions is how can  <br />I trust you ?''  <br /> <br />Oracle ''Bingo''  <br /> <br />LOL What mediocre writing and this is really an annoying part of the movie because the Oracle just basically like a parrot repeats with sarcasm what Neo questions  <br />and answers. LOL So basically the Oracle in MR like in the first movie has really no purpose.  <br /> <br />Neo does learn from the conversation I mean he learns what he already knows from the Oracle:  <br /> <br />The Oracle is basically just a mediocre program in the Matrix. He learns that the programs in the Matrix like Agent Smith are now hacking other programs and  <br />becoming stronger posing a threat to the Matrix universe, and this is confirmed when Agent Smith surprises Neo with a sneak attack that ends in laughable fashion with Agent Smith multiplying himself in characters to kill Neo but still failing LOL. This one of the most awful, and laughing hysterical fight sequences. You remember those dance fight scenes from ''West Side Story'' with Natalie Wood? LOL Thats exactly whatyou get here. It's so bloody awful it's funny, MST3K material in fact.  <br /> <br />The badly acted fight scene ends with jokes with  <br />Morpheus asking Neo if it was Agent Smith:  <br /> <br />Morpheus ''Was it Smith?''  <br />Neo ''Yes''  <br />Morpheus ''Now theres more than one of them?''  <br />Neo ''A lot more'' LMAO  <br /> <br />So Neo now wants to seek out the source and origin of the Matrix and he learns of a keymaker that holds a part of the answer to the Matrix and a couple of new characters , however trouble abounds again when Neo meets the Maitre'D (David Franklin) who holds the keymaker (whose basically a cheap asian locksmith guy lol) and does give him up. Futhermore the Maitre' D sends the ''The Twins'', special programs like Agent Smith with special abilities and who are now hell  <br />bent on killing Neo and his friends.....  <br /> <br />The MR as the name comes loaded with special effects. The action including the nearly 7 minute car chase scene with Neo illustrating his super powers in that scenes is great. The special effects and budget I read costs over $200  <br />million dollars and it does show for the most part.  <br /> <br />That pretty much is it for the Pros believe it or not now we get to the cons.  <br /> <br />The MR is the least successful sequel with the largest number of worthless characters I've seen. I felt tortured when I watch these crappy characters on  screen and made my self a sandwitch until we got to the point of the film , the action and effects including being blown up. lol Not really. As stated by first half  of the film I knew it was already a mess, a nice entertaining mess filled with special effects.  <br /> <br />First there is the short scene with one of the counselor of Zion (Jon Voight) that is incredibly annoying who basically just explains that he is an idiot that doesnt understand the way the world works. LOL Seriously thats the whole the point of this character. Then we have the character of Link , the black hacker (portrayed by mediocre actor Harold Perrineau Jr.) best known for his antics as the wheelchair bound convicted rapist in HBO's ''Oz'' (now over thank God). He's characters basically is there as comic relief (as if we needed any with this mess.) and act as the cheerleader for Neo and company. Oh yean and he has a worthless girl too.  <br /> <br />One critic said that MR fully develops the relationship between Trinity and Morpheus. LOL What relationship. At heart of both this films is that while Trinity and Morpheus  <br />are strong, they are also weak and they need Neo to bail out of critical situations of which they are helpless. That is the relationship. Then there is the character of Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith's Wife), who is the ex-girlfriend of Morpheus, who comes back to Zion to lead the fight against the Osiris    <br /> <br />All in all, I could go on and on about the flaws of MR it is heavily flawed, it was a blockbuster for the effects only folks, but with the somewhat absurd story in this, the movies <br />deserves ends up just being a \\"popcorn\\" movie.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|I would say that this is probably the best from Michael Buble',  he has certainly matured and is a real power house on this CD.
B000683VI4|2.0|I bought this film on DVD because I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks, although his novels, while interesting stories on different aspects of falling in love, still leave a lot to be desired, I was hoping that the movie would be better than the book...but its just as cheesy, with even more filler to complete the short novel.  I bought this dvd, excited about the special features and especially to hear Nicholas Sparks' commentary track, as I'm interested in what he thinks of this film.  The short special feature about him and his first novel was interesting, but too short, and he comes off looking like a cornball.  He should be embarrassed. <br /> <br />Someone in a review below said that the movie was more detailed than the novel and that the novel was \\"disappointing\\"...well, considering that the novel was published in 1996 and took this long to get to the screen...they had to fill out the story to make an appropriate film, otherwise it would have been an hour long, but maybe that isn't a bad idea.  There wasn't much for me to like about this film, and I doubt most guys would enjoy watching this film.  There are better love story films out there, but this doesn't come close.  However, this one is marginally better than \\"Message In A Bottle\\" (adapted from Nicholas Sparks' second novel), but comes no where near the impressive \\"A Walk To Remember\\" (adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' third novel).  If there are any more adaptations running around in Hollywood, I'd like to see \\"The Rescue\\" made into a movie, as that is my favorite Nicholas Sparks novel so far, but \\"The Wedding\\" (a \\"sequel of sorts\\" to \\"The Notebook\\") might be a wise choice. <br /> <br />In the short special feature on Nicholas Sparks, he claims not to be a \\"Hollywood type of guy\\", yet I don't see dvds that feature commentary tracks by Michael Cricton or John Grisham on adaptations of their novels.  That's a smart idea though and I'm glad that he does that for his film adaptations.  Its interesting to hear what a writer thinks of the film version to his novel creations.  That alone is worth the price of the dvd.
B00006JDS4|3.0|Cheesy B rated horror flick for the hairy armpit feminazi crowd.    Cheesy late 70's horror flick with stereotypical plots & portrayals for that time. Young liberated woman travels to remote wooded location for working vacation. There she is first harrassed then brutally raped by a group of local inbreds.  The rape scenes are extremely graphic, show totally nudity (you might wana trim that thing hunny). It's almost a snuff film.    After being repeatedly raped our heroine cleans herself up and plots revenge on the inbreds.  Using her liberated woman smarts and her seductive sex appeal (give me a break) she tricks the horny but stupid inbreds into lowering their guard. That's when she exacts her sweet revenge and kills the inbreds by a number of clever ways such as death by boat prop and hanging. She saves the best for last and kills the leader of the inbreds and instigator of the rapes. She cuts the dude's junk off and locks him in the bathroom to bleed to death. That will teach that manbeast and his phallus!

B0001ME5L2|1.0|The original \\"Under My Skin\\" is really a near trash album and for 2 more tracks, we actually have to pay so much more? The acoustics is not worth the money and even too much for I Always Get What I Want. <br /> <br />Don't get this album if you already have the original one or planning to get the original one.
0451527712|4.0|Popular culture would have us believe that Frankenstein is a hulking green cartoonish character, while in reality, Frankenstein is actually the name of the man who created the monster. Having read Mary Shelley's classic for a British Literature class, I feel that it is a shame that the majority of the population has a misrepresentation of Frankenstein.<br /><br />Prometheus is a figure in Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, and was punished by Zeus for it. Victor Frankenstein is quite young when he goes abroad to study and becomes obsessed with the occult side of science, ambitiously desiring to overcome death. Victor also desires to have a race worship him as creator, and in his ambition he feverishly toils, robbing graves and laboratories to build his monstrous creation, which he fashions to be beautiful. Upon completing his work, the fever that has led Victor on immediatly flees, and he sees his work as a monster, and runs terrified from it. This creature is infinitely more terrifying and horrible than the one described by popular culture--\\"...I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!--Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horried contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and straight black lips.\\"<br /><br />Frankenstein abandons his monster, and returns home, tortured by what he has created. After several misfortunes befall Frankenstein, he again meets the creature, who, we learn, has become eloquent and learned, but, scorned by every human, has become bitter and vengeful toward Frankenstein. He appeals to Frankenstein to make him a companion, or he will destroy Frankenstein and those he loves.<br /><br />The rest of the novel follows Victor as he struggles with this decision, and as more misfortunes befall him.<br /><br />Different types of readers will find sympathy with different characters. I myself found little sympathy for Frankenstein; his selfish ambition and ensuing cowardice and rationalization render him utterly pathetic in my mind. There is some ambiguity as to whether the creature is simply a misunderstood being, or whether he really is a malicious devil as our somewhat unreliable narrator tells us. What a reader chooses to believe will determine the themes that reader derives from the novel.<br /><br />Frankenstein could be seen as a charge against vain amibtion, or it could be seen as an account of man's inability to act as God. I myself felt that Mary Shelley was perhaps questioning God's relationship to man, a plausible explanation considering that Mary Shelley's husband was Percy Shelley, who got kicked out of Oxford for distributing an atheist pamphlet. What, exactly, is a creator's responsibility to his work? To whom do the boundaries of ethics apply? Who is the real monster, Frankenstein's creature or people who unfeelingly reject him? These are only a slice of the themes that intersect Shelley's novel, which is much more than a campy horror story. Frankenstein is a solid read that should not be overlooked by the modern reader, for it contains messages relevant to to us.this decision, and as more misfortunes befall him. <br /> <br />Different types of readers will find sympathy with different characters.

B00012FXAE|5.0|Sequels as most directors will tell you, are a tricky thing. How do you further expand the story and the characters in the first without it being just a mere echo of the last one? Like a cover song, you can either just be note for note for the original or just be way off target. Aliens is a rare sequel that to me is better than it's original and like I mentioned, in my top 5 films ever. <br /> <br />A rescue team stumbles onto the shuttle Ripley escaped in at the end of the first one. While in the hospital, she's told she's been in cryosleep for 57 years. Furthermore, in a deleted scene, she's told that her 11 year old daughter died, but as a grown up woman. Insult to injury, she's demoted by the company that owns the Nostromo, the refinery she blew up. <br /> <br />For the past 20 years, Weyland-Yutani, a kind of futuristic Microsoft let's say, had terraformed LV 426, the planet she landed on in the first one. Now the planet is habitable and a colony is placed there. Word is lost with the colony so the company sends in marines to rescue any survivors. Only this time, Ripley isn't facing one, she's facing a legion of them. <br /> <br />While Alien was a more horror \\"fear of the unknown\\" kind of film, Aliens is a more terror \\"being hunted\\" kind of film with combat elements. Like the tagline suggests, it's war. The film certainly gets your blood pumping. And like Ridley's film, Aliens doesn't show all the carnage and blood and guts, just gives you a sense that whatever fate falls on its characters is gonna be a bad one.  <br /> <br />Which brings up one little hiccup with the film: some of the marines. A couple of marines disobey a direct order to not use live ammunition which could set off a big explosion. And while he redeems himself in the end by going commando on several aliens, Bill Paxton plays probably the wimpiest marine you've ever seen but if that was the intent, kudos. <br /> <br />As for deleted scenes, it's more about character building which usually getson the cutting room floor, although there's a cool scene with sentry guns that I thought could've been nice. <br /> <br />I'm not one to say \\"go see this film right now\\" or \\"no DVD collection is complete without it\\" but I definately recommend it.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Robert \\"Mac the Knife\\" McNamara gives us a rare glimpse into the mind of the Secretary of Defense that led us into the tragedy of the Vietnam War.  He gives an interesting assessment of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when we avoided nuclear war by shear luck, as well as the moral ambiguity behind our raising of Japanese cities in WWII.  The eleven lessons he goes through should be considered by those leading us into another war where we are alone and opposed by allies.<br /><br />  The first lesson is \\"empathize with your enemy\\" which gave a narrow way out of the Missile Crisis of 1962.  He labels the U.S., Castro, and Krushchev as \\"rational\\"; very debatable as far as putting missiles in Cuba to begin with, LeMay's desire for war, and Castro's willingness to sacrifice Cuba in a nuclear war for Socialism.<br /><br />  We hear taped conversations of JFK and Mac about Vietnam, and learn of Mac's belief that JFK would NOT have escalated the way Johnson did, Chomsky's views notwithstanding. Mac was fired by LBJ in 1967 and was out of the loop for \\"Nixon doctrine in its purest form\\", namely the massive bombing of Cambodia that led to the Khmer Rouge genocide (\\"The Killing Fields\\" tells this story well).<br /><br />  LeMay was quite correct: had we lost the war he and Mac would have been executed for war crimes committed in Japan. Mac was complicit in genocide in Vietnam, and with him Hanna Arendt's phrase, \\"the banality of evil\\" comes to mind.  In hindsight he is haunted by what he's done, but is reluctant to second guess history, or at least to publicly incriminate himself.  In the end we get the impression of an ordinary man who reveals a sentimental side as he becomes tearful a few times.<br /><br />  I hope his vision of the future comes to pass: no more war.<br /><br />That vision he has is a contrast to his actions in Vietnam.  Many have learned the lesson of the past.  Those in charge of the world now don't seem to be in this group.
0380799006|4.0|I bought this book a couple of months after we brought home our newly adopted son from Russia and the rivalry and fighting looked to become a huge problem... a never-ending battle between our only-slightly-older son and his new brother. <br /> <br />Over time both adjusted and now we have just run-of-the-mill rivalry and occasional jealousy, something that is manageable. But those first weeks and months were awful. <br /> <br />This book is nicely written and reasonably well organized. It's a quick read and provides a lot of useful ideas for how to defuse and ultimately avoid situations. Much of it is common sense or \\"frame shifting\\" (putting you into the child's situation through their eyes). I found some of the strategies useful and others not applicable, which is what you'd expect. <br /> <br />The downside of this book is that it is a bit on the frothy side, a bit simplistic and stagey. Some of the examples and true-life type stories go from one extreme to a too-good-to-be-true resolution \\"a week later\\". Some of the divisions in the book struck me as artificial. <br /> <br />Nonetheless this book is the standard for many parent dealing with this kind of problem for good reason. It is a useful reference, gets you to think about managing the situations better and gives you some tools to work with. Well recommended.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Most people claimed that Bob Dylan's music sound weird and hard to understand and that's true. The instrument and the way that he sings never seem to match at all. \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" is a \\"Electricfy\\" album that electric guitars were used. Every track is a gem. There are two tracks that have become my all time favourite Dylan's songs - \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" & \\"Desolaton Row\\". Especially the later, the acoustic guitars just blow me away, I think I have listened to it a thousand times but I just don't get bored until now. Although the song lasts eleven minutes long but I never feel that long at all. This is truely a Dylan's classic with no doubt. I admit that Bob Dylan is weird but this is the exception.
B0001LYH9S|5.0|I know a lot of people don't like this album and write it off as \\"too conceptual\\" and i can see why a lot of people don't like it. I respect your opinions and I heartily disagree.  <br />I will say that musically, this may not be Bowie's best album, but as a whole and as a concept album that is supposed to tell a story, it works the best. Bowie tries to tell stories or at least portray certian charachters in many of his albums and i think Outside is the most sucessful at this. As other people have mentioned, it tells a futuristic detective story of a detective hunting a killer. The story that goes along with the album is told in the liner. People say it's hard to follow, but even with the non-linear set up of the story i followed the flow of the story pretty well both as it is written in the liner and also as it is told on the album. I think the problem with this album is that it may not appeal to typical Bowie fans, and that it would appeal more to fans of industrial music. This is the album that was out when he was touring with NIN and i can hear a lot of their influance in the songs and also in the set up of the album. NIN sets up their albums to have some songs that really jump out and grab you and to have lower key, transitional songs in between to help the album flow, and i see this set up in Outside as well. I've been a fan of the industrial genre for a long time and also a Bowie fan and this album combines a lot of industrial sounds but it's definantly NOT NIN or any other industrial band, David Bowie manages sucessfully to take influances and ideas from the genre but makes a final product that is creative and all his own. (this is one of the things i like about David Bowie) Even if it may not be the strongest album he's done from a purely musical standpoint, it's still very good musically as well. I enjoy every song on this album, and i can't say that of too many other albums. I would reccomend it for people who like industrial music, are interested in crime drama (another thing i'm completly obessed with) and like music that makes them think. I have to say that this is my favorite Bowie album, though of course, that is just personal preferance.
B0006IUDXA|3.0|I was really happy to see that Paramount had finally released a MacGyver DVD set (Season 1).  This show was fantastic, and I grew up watching MacGyver use whatever happened to be around to get out of many seemingly impossible situations.  As far as I am concerned, this show still gets a five star rating, for being fun and showing us that you can solve problems without guns or violence.  The reason I give this DVD set a 3 star rating is because of the lack of effort on Paramount's part when they put this set together.  There are no extras what so ever.  Nothing.  The sound and picture quality leave something to be desired.  The episodes have not been restored at all.  There are no booklets with this set.  And to top it all off, Paramount has gone and put about 3 or 4 advertisements for other products at the beginning of the first disc.  I payed money for this set, therefore I should not have to see commercials.  (DVD producers: Don't put ads on DVD's, it really sucks!)  When you come out with season 2 Paramount (and I still hope you do), please give us some extras, behind the scenes, outakes, commentarys, interviews with cast members, stuff like that.  Thank you.
B000000132|4.0|I REMEMBER HAVING THIS LP DURING MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARS IN THE 70'S, AND EVEN THOUGH I LOVED IT, I REALIZED BACK THEN THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST THREE CLASSICAL PIECES THAT I DON'T BELIEVE WERE GIVEN ANY CREDIT IN THE ALBUM NOTES.<br /><br />THE FIRST TRACK, \\"RUNNING HARD\\" IS SAID BY MANY REVIEWERS HERE ON AMAZON TO START WITH A \\"STUNNING\\" PIANO SOLO!  DAMN RIGHT IT'S STUNNING!  IT'S A NOTE FOR NOTE RIP OFF OF A FAMOUS ORGAN PIECE CALLED \\"LITANIES\\" BY THE INCREDIBLE 20TH CENTURY FRENCH COMPOSER JEHAN ALAIN!  AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS NOTICED THIS??<br /><br />THERE IS ANOTHER TRACK ON THE CD CALLED \\"COLD IS BEING\\".  THIS IS A RIP OFF OF ALBINONI'S ADAGIO FOR ORGAN AND STRINGS!<br /><br />THERE IS YET ONE OTHER PIECE ON THE DISC THAT USES THE PIANO PRELUDE BY DEBUSSY CALLED \\"THE SUNKEN CATHEDRAL\\".<br /><br />WOW! AFTER HAVING SAID ALL OF THIS, I STILL HAVE TO SAY THAT I LOVE RENAISSANCE AND I LOVE THIS DISC! IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY, BUT, COULDN'T RENAISSANCE GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE????  AT LEAST ELP DID THAT AND IT PUSHED ME INTO OTHER AVENUES OF MUSIC THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE VENTURED INTO.  THEY DON'T RIP OFF MUSIC LIKE THAT ANYMORE!

B00064MW6A|1.0|I look down on filmmakers for not making quality movies. They lack the sense of even making a movie enjoyable, was this film enjoyable? No. This film is a atrocity to filmmakers, and film in general. first of all, the director Pitof probably went into this movie with no creative ideas whatsoever. The acting in this film, was just, in plain terms, horrible. I felt that They seriously took the character of Catwoman, and made her name bad. Also, I feel that the only reason for this film was so that Halle Berry could get into the catsuit, and whip everbody in her way, talk about range. She has been making horrible films lately, I mean, Gothika, Swordfish? She is seriously not taking her Oscar seriously.also, shame on Warner Brothers for taking up this project, They have passed stage one of career sucide.<br /><br />Overall, this film was a blaspomy to movies, and people in general. This film made us feel stupid for seeing it, and it certianly has not been quite the sucess that the people behind the movie expected it to be. I implore you to not rent or buy this dismal piece of trash that calls itself a movie. It is in desperate need of a good review. Sharon Stone blamed George W. Bush on this movie failing. She said that \\"if the lesbian scene wasn't taken out by our stupid president, it wouldn't be the disaster it is.\\" I pity Sharon Stone, this \\"movie\\" was a disaster to begin with.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I like the way the story was told in the second Kill Bill.  The first one had minimal plot, and lots of blood and arms and legs and heads getting hacked off (which is all good), but the second had more of a story.  I liked Vol 2 just and much as Vol 1, but for different reasons.  I recommend this film!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I have never written a review on any musician or music that I have bought in 50 years.  Ray Charles was the first little 45's that I owned and from the first note I was hooked.  He gave us so much and took so little.  I am going back through my music library and listening all over again and must admit shedding some tears for what we are going to miss.  God speed Brother Ray and give heaven an earful.  Genius Loves Company needs to be a part of every music lovers library as it is a gift from Ray Charles.

B0002X314C|5.0|Anyone who has any interest in this genre of music has heard all of the great reviews about this John Legend album.  All I can say is that if you are still continplating whether or not to buy this album then you need to go to the store right now and buy it. <br /> <br />Everything you have heard about this album is probably true.  Its truly amazing.  The lyrics, the melody, the production, and the album as a whole.  Every song on the album is good but here are a few of my favorites: <br /> <br />-Lets Get Lifted <br />-Used To Love You - his first single <br />-Number One feat. Kanye West, (great song) <br />-I Can Change feat Snoop (this is a suprisingly good calaboration) <br />-Ordinary People (his second single) <br /> <br />Like I said before those songs are my favs but every song is good, take those as my top 5 songs.  THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!!
B00005OAA6|3.0|Ok so she can sing but when I listened to this album on a plane journey (because there was nothing else) I enjoyed the first few tracks but after the 3rd track it gets boring and starts getting annoying because there isn't anything new or experimental in tracks. You feel as if you've heard the melody off other R&B/Pop Artists, I suggest you buy this if you're a Spice girls Fan
B00000295Y|5.0|Back when this was released in 1993 there was other dope rappers droppin' tight records, Dr Dre \\"The Chronic\\", Wu tang \\"Enter the Wu tang\\", Snoop Dogg \\"Doggystyle\\" and also this Black Sunday, it is there second album and in my opinion is better than the first which was released in 91'. After this album Cypress started to fall (even though Cypress Hill 3: Temple of Boom was good) until they are where they are now, releasing weak albums for a rock audience and not appealing to hip hop fans. But this is not that and is pure hip hop.<br /><br />B-real is a talented rapper and his raps are tight, Sen Dog is also goodon this CD and of course DJ Muggs does some dope producing.<br /><br />The whole album is great but there is some standout tracks \\"Insane in the Brain\\" which was a hip hop classic. \\"I ain't goin' out like that\\" is a great song with a tight beat by Muggs also check \\"Hits from the Bong\\" \\"3 Lil Putos\\" \\"When the sh-t goes down\\" and \\"Lick a Shot\\"<br /><br />If you don't own this classic buy it now cause you wont regret it.
B0006SSOHM|3.0|Perhaps, Saw isn't a movie that I will add to my movie library any time soon.  Be that as it may, it no doubt asserts itself as a rather memorable movie nonetheless.  From the beginning, you are thrust into a sick milieu that will, if anything, grab your attention and not let go until the clever ending.<br /><br />While not great by any stretch, Saw is most definitely worth a look for those who enjoy Seven and the like.
B000063S6Z|5.0|this is a wonderful album. it driftingly finds the souls of rhythm and ambience and brings out solors of music that one only dreams about. i was not a fan of moby before i got this album and i have to say, it was worth it. buy this album. i promise you, you will not want to return it. it is something to listen to when nothing else will do, and also it should have a nice place in your cd collection
B000089RVX|5.0|I used only listen to rap, but I've started to listen to soft rock which began with nickelback. 4 months ago I listened to \\"broken\\" on the radio  and was blown away my amy lee's voice. Then I found out about evanescence and I bought this cd. I love most of the songs here but my favs are my immortal and missing. It's something about how voice and how she sings that makes you feel what she is saying, it's really amazing. there is only a very select few that can stir your emotions by their songs, for me 2pac is the best at it. You can FEEL what he is saying and it hits your heart like a pound a bricks and I feel amy lee is very similar to that. Buy this cd it's very good, amy lee's voice is out of this world.
0060920084|3.0|I bought this because of the reviews, as I figured I'd be in pain from laughing so hard. I travel a lot, especially to National Parks and Battlefields.  I laughed a bit, even a few times out loud, but after the first few chapters it grew a bit weary on me. It unfortunately was the same tale at every place the author went. Fat women in bad shorts, ugly rowdy kids, and dull visitor's centers. Yes, we know tourist traps are full of chuncky women in tight Bermudas, but didn't Bryson see any hideous men with them?  Bryson seems almost content to head back to his flea motel and down a six-pack in bed. Not quite the type of guy to pick on everybody else for their looks.   I would still recommend it for frequent travelers, but be prepared for the dislocated American (he moved to England many years back) to be really critical of people he sees along his kind of dull trip.

0743454529|4.0|I picked up this novel back in December but did not have a chance to start it until Wednesday of this week. I just finished it today and I am sad to see it end. I am surprised that I have not encountered Picoult's work before, as I am an avid reader, but after reading My Sister's Keeper I am definitely going to pick up another one of her novels. <br /> <br />Throughout the book I was torn between characters, specifically Sara and Anna. I am not a mother, so I do not know what it must be like to have a dying child on my hands. As a teenager, I cannot imagine what it would be like to be pushed to give up an organ, lymphocytes, etc every time my sibling needed it. I spoke to my mother about this and she said she would never ask me to do a thing like that, nor would she conceive a child to save another. Because of this, I really disliked Sara. Some of the things she said and did throughout the book really upset me, and anyone who really cared about their child for all the right reasons would not have done those things. <br /> <br />The ending broke my heart. I know it's not medically accurate for Kate to have lived, but it was beautiful to me. I do believe miracles like that do happen, because I believe there is a God. Anyway, it was beautiful...if you haven't read it, pick it up!
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|This movie probably won't appeal to the masses, but for guitarists, it is the holy grail of movies.  While the overall plot isn't bad, the real gemstone of this movie is the guitar playing.  Many movies feature \\"duels\\" between the protagonist and antagonist, but have actors that really don't know what the hell they are doing playing those parts.<br /><br />If nothing else, the final duel makes this whole movie.  Starting with Ry Cooder on the slide (visualised through Maccio) vs. Vai (Played by Vai) and finishing with Vai (again through Maccio) vs. Vai (as Vai), the duel sequence isn't somthing you are going to listen to and pshaw at pointing out how they really aren't that good.  Because they are that good.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is certainly worth watching, but the ending duel is really where it shines.  I'm just glad it was a Charvel that hit the floor instead of a real Jackson - and what the heck is Vai doing without an Ibanez in his hands anyway? :)<br /><br />Sadly, the duel isn't included on the Crossroads soundtrack, but Vai recently released it on his \\"Elusive Light & Sound 1\\" CD.
B000001FKY|5.0|This release by Def Leppard in its own could be considered a greatest hits release.  No filler tracks on this original release.  Excellent from start to finish as you will find most of the tracks either played during live shows and included on any \\"greatest hits\\" release.  I don't have it on cd, but I would imagine that the sound quality is equal if not better.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Every song on this CD is an expression of true talent.  She is deep.  If you cannot grasp the concept...maybe you should stick to the typical long haired, gyrating, crazy looking, chicken hoe dancing, lip gloss wearing, un-beweavable, studio track singers ( you know who you are).  If you are looking for something different, deep, and herbalicious..this is for you.
B000002JS6|5.0|What do you do when your lead singer passes away during recording sessions for a new album?  Bring in Brian Johnson and release arguably one of the best albums of all time.  Bon Scott was great and probably very hard to replace after his death.  Enter Brian Johnson and the band continues releasing new material for the next 20 plus years.  This release could easily in its own be a greatest hits release and most of the songs are played reguarly in concert.  Highly recommended.
B000002BE9|4.0|Fiona Apple emerged from nowhere at the age of 18 with this CD in 1996. 9 years later, it still sounds fresh and original. Mixing instrumentation from 60s psychedelia (backwards guitars), jazz (marimba and vibraphone), country (pedal steel), and even a bit of avant-garde skronk, Apple and her cohorts create a musical brew completely its own and completely captivating.<br /><br />Best known tracks here are \\"Criminal\\", as Fiona seeks to pay penance for romantic misdeeds, and \\"Shadowboxer\\" casts the young ingenue as a prizefighter struggling to fend off a wily suitor.<br /><br />But there's lots more fine material to be had here: the smokey jazz club ambience of \\"Slow Like Honey\\",while the vibraphone of \\"The First Taste\\" marries with a loping midtempo suggestive of a Sade tune. \\"The Child is Gone\\" looks at the awkward transition to adulthood and opener \\"Sleep to Dream\\" is a defiant manifesto of a woman tired of a man playing \\"love you/love you not\\".<br /><br />While there are no outright clunkers here, the disc would benefit from some more mid to uptempo songs for variety's sake. For that reason, \\"Tidal\\" doesn't get the top rating.
B000002JSN|5.0|It's hard to imagine having so much great material that you have to release a double album.  Most band releases include a couple of hits and then a lot of filler.  This release is a classic Zep era release.  The songs go in so many different directions but all sound great from begining to end.  I am sure the cd release even sounds better.  I have the original album and most of the songs on cd from the box set.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Star Trek: Enterprise is a terrific show and the first season demonstrates all of the potential possibilities of this concept.  While I will admit that it doesn't always stick to its own premise; the foundations of Starfleet; the founding of the Federation, etc. Enterprise is full of amazing potential, as this set will demonstrate.  We have every episode on videotape and are so looking forward to the DVDs.  You can watch season one and realize that it is quite literally, only a shadow of things to come in season four.  Season three was a little strange, but it ended well, giving us new energy for the fourth year.  Enterprise became a wonderful adventure.  It wasn't always a ratings winner and like all of Star Trek, it has its detractors.  But that's the thing about Star Trek isn't it?  If you don't like one, there are plenty more.  I for example, was never a big fan of Voyager because to me it was a little like Star Trek: Lost in Space.  But everybody has their favorites, and that's the way it should be.  I'm proud that now I can share one of mine.  I think time will judge the series not as unsuccessful, but as a show that developed into something great and was canceled before its time.  By the way, if you enjoy this series, contact Paramount and tell them to give us season five.  For more information on that, you can go to [...]
B000002572|5.0|I thought everyone had this on album, tape, and/or cd.  This is Boston's historic and record setting debut.  Could be a greatest hits release in its own from start to finish.  Tom Sholtz is a genius and it's only a shame the releases couldn't have come out quicker.  This will turn into one of your most played cd's, highly recommended.
B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead not only made it in the whirling genres of the nineties with this album, but Dummy is a unique contribution to how we can define musicality today, needless to say each song defies the logic of how a performance may sound. Discontinous but absorbing, the songs preserve a distance,that is only theirs. The rich melange of scratches,Beth's innovative voice,and the dramatism accompanying this audition of not more than fifty minutes, exceeds the categories of electronic minimalism,note that instruments like guitar and violin are present. The songs preserve their prelude without any of threat of repetition, a state of trance and unawareness that probably the sirenes on \\"strangers\\" or \\"numb\\" express so well. This aural state in which beth's monologues take place, grasps the fragile corridors of a consciousness full of doubt and trembling, as the the girlie, sometimes violent voice transcends the instrumentals. Thanks to the experimental freedom inspiring this record Portishead managed to be as pictoresque as trip-hop can rarely be,of course preserving some major elements of this genre...
B0006284JQ|5.0|The only thing to say about Britney Spears is that she has yet done it again. She has put together one amazing album with some of her greatest song's  from her first album with \\"Baby One More Time to her last studio album \\"Everytime\\" and then she added some very different sounding song's that has never been released \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\", \\"Do Somethin\\" and then how could you forget the remake of Bobby Brown's song \\"My Prerogative.\\" The one bad thing about this album is that she didn't include \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" and \\"Born To Make You Happy.\\" The bouns cd of some of her unmarkable tune's is great too. Every song on the album is great.     1.) My Prerogative(Previously Unreleased) 5/5 This song describe's her perfectly.   2.) Toxic 5/5  3.) I'm A Slave 4 U 4/5  4.) Oops... I Did It Again 5/5  5.)

Brintey Spears is one of the most talented singers around but she is being overlooked down because of she dresses and what she does in her personal life. The way she dresses is the way she want's to dress and what she does in her personal life is her business and not our's. Those are the main 2 factor's of why she is always getting judged and that is why people won't give her music a chance. How she dresses and what her personal life is doesn't have anything to do with the music she makes. She has growen up since releasing \\"Baby One More Time\\" and she only get's better throughout time. She has closed a chapter of her life and another one is just beginning. It was a perfect timing for her greatest hit's.     Overall: This is a great album by yet another talented artist that has an amazing voice.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Madonna's rippling biceps have more personality than this dull CD. When did she metamorph into the fly!?! She looks like an alien.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Great imagery and catchy tunes.  This film is as interesting to watch as it is to listen to.  The fun thing with the music in this movie is that during the time all this decadence was taking place, most of the tunes hadn't been written yet! Kidman & McGregor do a fairly okay job of singing their songs.  They can both hold a tune and their voices work fairly well for this project but let's not start casting them in any serious musicals just yet.  While their voices are fine here, as a rule, their voices are much too weak for anything more than what they have accomplished here. <br /> <br />This musical is a lot of fun and I say that as a person who does not like musicals.  In fact I hate them.  As with Luhrmanns's Romeo & Juliet, Moulin Rouge has a special quality that helps the dialogue scenes flow smoothly into the musical numbers.  I can only imagine what it would have sounded like if two real singers had been cast.  Of course if the singers can't act then we have a problem so better to go with the actors instead.  <br /> <br />The dance numbers are fresh and very unique.  I give them two thumbs up.  I'm at a loss to describe them.  You'll have to see for yourself. <br /> <br />I reccomend it highly.   <br />Parental advisory:  Buy with confidence.  No foul language, nudity or sex.  Some scenes may be too intense for young children.  I advise a viewing age of at least 15 years old.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one of the most creative films on the market today.  Quentin Tarantino masterfully weaves together several vignettes on the journey of X (I will not say her name, since it is part of the storytelling process to make her name have more value by awaiting the moment it is revealed in Vol 2).  The story unfolds in flashbacks rather than in chronological order, creating more interest, suspense and mystery about how the female warrior winds up on her path of revenge.  Lucy Liu is magnificently feminine, powerful, courteous and vicious, and her scenes are an incredible dynamic between the image of a fragile beautiful woman in Japanese robes and a well-trained killer who is respected and feared.  Tarantino uses a wonderful juxtaposition of happy little musical tunes over scenese of conflict, and he utilizes a variety of film techniques, including animation, as the story unfolds.  If you have issues with violence, do not see this film.  It is, however, wonderfully creative and the female warrior comes into her own power, has a cause, and her steel will and determination allow her to overcome the limitations of her body to undertake her journey.  I don't agree with her methods, but I love her power, her strength, her courage and the beauty that emerges.
B0002XDODU|2.0|True fans of Rammstein can never like this. I listened to it not more than 5 times in the last 2 months. Mutter was good but not even close to their first 2 albums. This is even further away. They should go to thier roots. The style from thier first 2 albums is nowhere near done and no band can do it like they do. So go back. <br /> <br />If you guys like this kind of music, give Eisbrecher a try. more electronic but way better than Reise.
1892005034|4.0|NVC or Non-Violent Communication is build on a solid foundation.  This book was written quite simply, so that anyone might learn the techniques of speaking clearly so that others can understand what you think, what you feel, and what you want.  It also offers valuable information on \\"empathic listening\\" - rather than just parroting back what someone says to demonstrate that you HEARD, you go a step further to express that you understand what someone is thinking and feeling.  I know several people who have gone to NVC workshops and practice NVC regularly, and they are incredible supporters of this technique.  They say that while initially your conversations may seem rather stiff and formulaic, that as the technique becomes more natural to you, that it is simply a clear way of understanding yourself and communicating in a way that others can hear and accept more readily.  It is a wonderful technique, I have found it helpful, however it really does not allow for the full depth of emotion and thoughts that create that emotion.  Sometimes thoughts are not logical, but may be underlying schema or beliefs that each individual may not want to even acknowledge, never mind express out loud.  The book and technique are excellent, but this all needs to be refined a bit more to really allow emotion to be expressed, not just intellectually identified.  \\"I am feeling anxious because my need for security is not met, will you please contribute to the rent?\\" is very clear, but the speaker does not actually show their anxiety.  I suppose if we all learn to communicate without allowing ourselves to express the emotions we are feeling (like Vulcans) then our communication will be more clear and peaceful.  It will also lack a certain amount of depth.  Also, not every conflict can be resolved with NVC - the author begins by talking about how he mediated discussions with Palestinians and Israelis, and street gangs who were in gang wars.  That sounds pretty dramatic, to even get some folksinto the same room.  However, NVC may not solve the problems that lead to the conflicts.  It may allow for a greater understanding between sides.  The book could have been shorter, with fewer personal anecdotes.  The method is sound, and just needs a bit of refining.  What a great way to build a bridge and develop understanding between people!
B00020HEG6|5.0|John Williams has definitely struck gold with his score for \\"Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban\\"... Through many varied styles of music, he sets the stage for the third installment of the Harry Potter film series. In \\"The Knight Bus\\", he uses a delirious, upbeat '50s jazz piece to set up the jaunty ride aboard a triple decker bus... In \\"Window To The Past\\", he creates an very nostalgic, sad setting as Harry begins to learn even more about his troubled past. It would be easy for one to go on and on, but simply put, this soundtrack is definitely one of the most varied and well thought out...period. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys not just Harry Potter series, but music of any kind!
B00005JMUA|4.0|David Carradine was remarkable.  When I heard he was playing the role of \\"Bill\\", I was skeptical.  I am a fan of his earlier work as a good guy, lone-ranger type martial artist, but Carradine playing a ruthless assassin?  He was magnificent.  This film allowed us to see that while Uma Therman, the female warrior, was a protagonist, she was not a \\"good guy\\" and Carradine as the villian was not a \\"bad guy.\\"  Circumstances created their situation.  Tarantino tackled some tough ethics questions on the choices the female warrior undertook (her name being revealed is part of the story so I won't blow it for you!).  We can also empathize with Bill's pain and suffering.  Surprisingly, ultimately this was a warped, twisted love story.  Behind anger, there is pain, behind pain and fear, there is love.  Love can die as we make certain choices in our lives.  Tarantino designed his trademark quirky soundtrack which awakened a lot of new perspectives, to hear the juxtaposition of playful music over scenes of violence.  It made the violence both more and less brutual.  Michael Madsen did a great job of making the lofty revenge quest seem ridiculous, as he was leading his practical day-to-day banal life.  However, underneath that banal life, he still did not relinquish some of his principles.  Daryl Hannah - was comical, and a villain you love to hate.  Good stretch in her acting ability and she carried it off well.  Carradine steals the show though.  Tarantino did not get quite as creative in his style in Vol 2 (not much fusion of other genres and methods to tell his tale), but it was well done.  The wrap up was appropriately bittersweet.  If you like the \\"warrior ethic\\" and admire those with a \\"code of honor\\" you might like this film.  If you prefer romantic comedies, this is NOT for you.
B0007TKH66|4.0|As a long-time Trekkie from the original run in the 60s, I recommend \\"Enterprise\\" highly. Ignore the fashionable negativity.

Support \\"Star Trek\\" and support \\"Enterprise.\\" You won't be sorry.
B000002KDI|1.0|Imagine, if you will, that Capitol Records chose years ago to put out the Beatles' \\"White Album\\" on compact disk when the format was in its infancy, and for whatever reason decided not to invest the funds to put out a double CD, instead choosing to cram the entire thing onto one CD, and advertising it as a \\"specially low-priced single disk.\\" But in doing so, they found that the whole thing wouldn't fit onto a standard disk, so they hacked about a minute or so out of \\"Revolution #9\\" (thinking nobody would notice), eliminated or shortened the silence between songs (if any), and nickel-and-diming the album until it fit just under the time limitations of a single disk. Then pretend that Beatles fans were too blinded by their fanaticism for the album to objectively criticize, let alone realize, the absolute horror of this corporate hatchet job. If this fictitious story sounds too weird for you, then now you know how I feel seeing five-star review after review here, when Warner-Reprise has performed the ultimate sin right under all our noses.<br /><br />I only recently started amassing a CD collection of Neil, preferring to stick to the vinyl. I figured there will eventually be a remaster job of these albums, although with Neil you never know, and I could wait until then. But I broke down and went ahead and bought \\"Live Rust\\" on CD, which is one of my absolute top 10 favorite albums of all time. Knowing the guitar majesty of \\"Cortez the Killer\\" on this album better than I know my own date of birth, and having heard it countless times note-for-note, I immediately fast-forwarded to that track and waited for my world to be sonically blown to bits by the digital clarity of the CD, which happened indeed. For about four minutes.<br /><br />And then I stopped cold. I stared out the window. I was frozen, playing air guitar to notes that were no longer coming out of the speaker, singing guitar parts in my head that weren't happening. \\"Am I getting that progressed into Alzheimer's already?\\" I thought, or is this some sort of a defective joke? Well, my Neil fan faithful, I'm here to tell you: the actual track of \\"Cortez\\" is approximately a minute and a half shorter than not only the vinyl version, but a minute and a half shorter than THE TIME GUARANTEED TO ME ON THE CD INSERT by good ol' Warner-Reprise. And where did this extra 90 seconds come from? well, it was right there in the LEAD GUITAR parts of the song, right prior to the \\"hate was just a legend\\" lyric. They have AXED a huge section of Neil's guitar lead, digitized it out to save space, and done God-knows-what to the rest of the album to give us a low, low price.<br /><br />I frantically fast-forwarded the track to the end and compared the ending times on my CD player to the one on the CD cover. I was right. And I was disgusted. Then I started REALLY losing it: who was responsible for this? And why in the living name of God could any self-respecting Neil fan put up with the absolute desecration of one of the greatest recorded versions of one of his most jaw-droppingly gnarly songs?<br /><br />I for one took the CD back. It took me a while to explain to the clerk why, but he chalked it up to a bad mistake on WB's part. Personally, I think their strange urgency in reissuing four of his least-selling albums \\"remastered with the original cover art\\" on CD is unusually nice, but I would much rather have a full-blown remastered version of \\"Live Rust\\" than anything else in his catalog. Especially now that I know about this hatchet job that sits on the shelf indefinitely, with no plans to improve on it. And Reprise, while you're at the task of putting that 90 seconds of guitar bliss back into \\"Cortez\\" that you so thoughtfully took out, go ahead and put out some other songs from that tour that weren't on the original CD to restore my faith in corporate America, because this is more of a disgrace than Watergate, \\"read my lips\\", and Monica's dress put together.

B00000IN5G|5.0|I never thought I'd end up listening to music as hilariously evil as this.  I guess if you're hardcore and into Satanism, then by all means, skip this disc, since it seems no one likes it.  It ain't evil, but it dips its metallic toes into the springs of classical music and baroque just enough to pique my curiosity.<br /><br />I find humor in this music.  This was my first album of theirs that a friend got me into.  After a year, I bought \\"Something Wild\\" and then \\"Follow the Reaper,\\" and I still think their \\"Green Album\\" is far superior to both albums as a whole.  (Please note that \\"Follow\\" is more mature in compositional style.)<br /><br />\\"Hatebreeder\\" is not a collection of songs.  It's an opus, each song a movement.<br /><br />WWWWHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I don't mind that I can't understand a single thing he's saying.  It's like listening to German punkrock.

0553274503|4.0|Imagine that you are retarded. Retarded, but still cognizant of that fact. You don't want to be retarded. You yearn to be smart. You try to be smart. You go to a school for special people, people like yourself. But you don't get any smarter. One day a man gives you the chance to change your life. You accept and he performs an operation. Poof! Your IQ skyrockets and you learn everything you can. You're finally smart. But there's a catch. Your mind has developed, but not your maturity level. You still act like a child. This is the story of \\"Flowers For Algernon\\", the compelling novel of a startling human experiment. <br /> <br />   \\"Flowers For Algernon\\" is an excellent novel, with its share of love, science, friendship, and a bit of adventure. The 1966 book has become a timeless classic, and with good reason. Upon reading the novel, it's hard to believe \\"Flowers For Algernon\\" was written almost 40 years ago. For a 39-year-old story, it seems very real and relevant. The scientific breakthrough at the heart of the story seems no different from the many scientific breakthroughs being made today. <br /> <br />   A good book allows readers to know the characters inside and out. \\"Flowers For Algernon\\" is no exception. During the course of the book, you get to know the characters. You feel for them. You're sad when they are unhappy. You're thrilled when they are happy. Instead of two-dimensional cardboard cutouts, the loveable characters seem like three-dimensional people. <br />   \\"Flowers For Algernon\\" takes place mainly in a small town outside a big city. By being vague about the specific location and name of the city, the author makes it seem as if it could be anywhere. This adds to the book's realism. The book is written in the form of a journal kept by the main character, Charlie. This allows the reader to see how Charlie writes (i.e. spelling, grammar, mechanics) as he goes from retardation to genius and back again. <br /> <br />   \\"Flowers For Algernon\\" is a deep, heavy book that takes a while to get through. It has its fair share of sad and touching moments. Be prepared to be unable to put the book down. The book was so well-received after its publication, it was made into a movie. The main character, played by Cliff Robertson, won an Academy Award for best actor. All in all, \\"Flowers For Algernon\\" is a truly interesting book that will continue to be read for many years to come. <br />
B00005ATQF|5.0|It is strange that Kubrick would choose to revisit the theme of war, considering that he had already conquered the genre with the classic controversial `Paths of Glory' and had done a variation of the theme for `Spartacus', the war comedy `Dr. Strangelove', `Full Metal Jacket', a war film, seems an unlikely career choice, given that Kubrick had not made a film in 7 years since `The Shining', this happens to be his second last film, made in the UK London docks in 1987, it would be 12 years before Kubrick would film again, the somewhat average `Eyes Wide Shut', making this probably his last best film.<br /><br />FMJ is a well made war film full of interesting characters (lots of them) and stunning set pieces - Boot camp and the final war torn city sniper search being the most memorable, FMJ is not exactly original, but the fact that when Kubrick does it right then it usually turns out great, this is another Vietnam war film, that is very good, period. Even though R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman has almost the exact same lines as Louis Gossett Jr., playing Sgt. Emil Foley in `An Officer and a Gentleman', you will watch him in FMJ more than turning to the Richard Gere vehicle. Even though you have seen it all before, it is still worth watching because the set pieces are just done well and the acting is quite good, most noticeably, D'Onofrio as Pyle, cracking under the pressure of drill training and eventually turning on his own squad.<br /><br />FMJ is a two part story, Boot Camp and then War, the newly fresh Marine Corps recruits becoming death, deciding fate, taking action, suffering consequences, `The Draft' a prison for the recruit who should not be there, section 8s everywhere, killers who do not know why they are in Vietnam thrust into the Tet offensive head-on, most of them have peace symbols but will they kill?... or be killed<br /><br />Although quite violent and bloody Kubrick mostly chooses psychology. There is not much to it other than to show the horror of war from the viewpoint that it is just such a mixed bag, from those who are afraid to pull the trigger, to full blown adult criminal sadists leading the men to victory. Kubrick captures Vietnam quite well and Full Metal Jacket is certainly an important film in any collection, as it will be watched time and time again for the high production values and strong acting. Although it might not carry that much of a message like `Paths of Glory' did, it certainly doesn't shy away from showing us the horror of war.<br /><br />As a note this is a PAN and SCAN movie, shot in 1.85 : 1, it was shown in this aspect ratio in the US and then in 1.66 : 1 in Europe. Kurbick did not want to release this in widescreen or even flat.

I'm especially partial to &quot;Beautiful&quot;, a wonderful kind of song you'd play after a sensual movie.<BR>India.Arie has not been recognized well, and I DO NOT know why!

B000025XKM|2.0|This album had such a reputation that I could not miss it. What I must say, this is not for people who enjoy bubblegum hummable top 40 tunes; or most other people I'm sad to say. The songs are tuneless, melancholic droning without any distinct structure. Pink Moon is the only redeemable track. Nick Drake the 'tortured' genius the legend has become intertwine with his music so that its not his talent alone, but the sad story of his premature death which has carried this decidedly mediocre record. <br /> <br />If you're into depressing music then Elliott Smith offers much more listenable fare. At least his songs have beautiful melody, harmonies, instrumentals.etc.
B000002AZ8|3.0|This is actually the 1 Pearl Jam album that even came close to turning me away. I guess after their first two MAMMOTH hits, \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs\\", I was expecting a lot more. Late summer/early fall of '94 I practically worshipped those two albums, listening to them non-stop in anticipation of Pearl Jam's upcoming and third release, \\"Vitalogy\\". When it finally came out, I was very disappointed when I first listened to it. But then I remembered, that's how I felt about \\"Vs\\" when it first came out. So, being an extremely devoted and crazed fan, I gave it several more trys. Finally it started to grow on me; but only a little. I guess it's because I am such a DIE-HARD fan of Pearl Jam that I am excited and proud to listen to ANY \\"NEW\\" music from them, despite how some of it may seem unlistenable. But still to this day, 11 years later, I can not completely get into this album no matter how hard I try. Now, I totally respect Pearl Jam not wanting to repeat themselves and especially the success and perfection of \\"Ten\\", and I can honestly say I love how each new and powerful album has it's own different and unique sound. But \\"Vitalogy\\" is where I have to draw the line. Utterly pointless, filler garbage like \\"pry, to\\", \\"bugs\\"(HORRIBLE!), and \\"stupid mop\\" really ruined it for me. Even without that trash, I still consider it just an average album. A lot of people knock \\"Aye Davanita\\", which is filler, but atleast it's way better than the other insults. I thought crappy sounding tracks like \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" (Come on! You call that talent?!) and \\"Satan's Bed\\" were WAY below average as far as Pearl Jam's music goes, and they only further ruined the album for me. However, I rated \\"Vitalogy\\" 3 stars for most of the other songs, which in time helped me to accept the album as a whole. These songs are: \\"Not For You\\", \\"Tremor Christ\\", \\"Nothingman\\", \\"Whipping\\", \\"Corduroy\\", <br />\\"Betterman\\", and \\"Immortality\\". The album's opener, \\"Last Exit\\", just didn't do it for me- it seemed real rushed and lame. And having two songs on the same album ending with \\"man\\" leads one to wonder, \\"were these guys starving for creativity in the song-title department?\\" And to top it off, the CD packaging is the WORST I've EVER seen anyone do. Cool booklet (other than missing lyrics to \\"Corduroy\\"), but still an over-all real cheesy looking and formated album cover that looks like something I'd find in my grandmother's basement. Definitely NOT something I'd expect from Pearl Jam is the most lamest album cover imaginable. But when first seeing it, I knew not to \\"judge a book by it's cover\\", but after hearing the average material inside time and time and it never fully grabbing me, I realized that for once, the cover matches what's inside. Luckily, I KNEW in my heart that Pearl Jam could and would do WAY BETTER albums in the future, so I stuck by them during this \\"thin\\" time. And thank God, I was right- from \\"No Code\\" on up to \\"Lost Dogs\\", their future albums totally knocked their only insult, \\"Vitalogy\\", out of the water. WAY out of the water. They redeemed themselves and they continue to amaze me with their unbelievable music, which is why I can look past this so-so, 3-star album. \\"Vitalogy\\", for me, is for die-hard fan's only and for completionist's. If you want the few good tracks on this album, get their greatest hits        \\"Rearviewmirror\\". Otherwise, you might get this album and ask yourself, is this average and sometimes crappy material really the Pearl Jam I have come to know and love?? Just my opinion, ofcourse, but they CAN do way better and they HAVE. Just listen to any of their other albums and then pop this hard listener in, and see how far and miserably they fell. But as I said, it's just my opinion. I know alot of people who love \\"Vitalogy\\" for some odd reason. To each his own, I guess.
B00008AWOG|5.0|If you feel like i did 5 years ago and have become disenchanted with the state of what is considered metal, or music for that matter, Then let me recommend this album with a promise that it will blow your mind.<br /><br />Opeth is hands down one of the most amazing bands your ears will be fortunate enough to hear if you take the chance, And still life in my humble opinion is somewhere in the top ten best metal albums ever.  I think though to say that opeth are purely metal is to pigeonhole this band, Their versatility extends to a wide range of musical influences like folk and jazz and multicultural influences. The guitar dual of singer/guitarist Mikael Akerfeldt and guitarist Peter Lindgren at times seem almost orchestral in their arrangement and might i add are rarely matched by comparison.<br /><br />Everything works here and leaves you spellbound from start to finish, Astounding guitar work compliments Mikael's dynamic vocals that shift between deep growls to beautiful soft harmonies.  Great drumming here also and poetic lyrics, I don't think these guys have it in them to make a bad album and if you take my advise (trust me you'll be happy you did)and like this one please..Do yourself the favor of checking out their other cd's blackwater park, damnation, orchid, etc.<br /><br />Favorite tracks on this album: the moor, godhead's lament, benighted, face of melinda.
B0000027RL|5.0|Wow. I'm 17, still listening to some bland 80's \\"hair\\" groups and along came \\"Ten\\", which opened my eyes to a whole new world of music NEVER to be topped: the music of PEARL JAM. In school, I heard that it was real good, so although being a little sceptical despite having heard \\"Even Flow\\" and \\"Jeremy\\" on the radio, I went out and bought it and never turned back. I honestly can not think of words strong enough to describe my love for this album. My jaw dropped the first five times I listened to it, and I was in complete awe of this FANTASTIC new group. I knew I had found my band FOR LIFE. I cherished this album to no end and I KNEW I would absolutely love any music this unstoppable group would put out, and I vowed to stick with them for ever, through thick and thin, if they were even capable of \\"thin\\". Needless to say, 13 years later, they are still my ALL TIME FAVORITE group and I love and cherish everything they put out, and it all comes back to this UNBELIEVABLE album. It's so good that it's even in a TOTALLY DIFFERENT ball-park than all their other work. This was by far their most well put together masterpiece and quite possibly one of the GREATEST rock albums of all time. No filler what so ever, just real concentrated perfection. This album not only eventually stomped out all it's competition (STEP ASIDE AND CLEAR A PATH, nirvana!!) but it also was so PERFECT in every sense of the word that it will never be repeated again. Sure, all future work was well worth 50 stars as well, save one (see my \\"Vitalogy\\" review), and I love all their earth-shattering albums, but \\"VS\\" on through \\"Riot Act\\" and \\"Lost Dogs\\" (a collection to end ALL collections) just followed a slightly different formula than \\"Ten\\". Which is great if you remember to not compare them to this debut, because ALL their albums are SUPERB in their own right. You just have to remember that Pearl Jam WAS in fact aiming for a more raw and rough edge from \\"VS\\" on. They COULD make another \\"TEN\\" and please theworld, but instead, they stayed true to themselves and made music THEY wanted to make, and not necessarily what the world would always want to listen to, and you just gotta give them respect for that. That's another reason I love all their work- they are always experimenting with new sounds and evolving into the next \\"LED ZEPPELIN\\" of the new millenium. And it all started with a gigantic explosion- \\"Ten\\". If you can keep an open mind while getting into Pearl Jam and are not expecting the same album over and over, I would suggest starting here- you will NOT regret it. Just expect a change come \\"VS\\". But trust me- it's just as good a change as \\"Ten\\" is dynamite. Or if you want to hear only what Pearl Jam have sounded like for the majority of their career, start with \\"VS\\" (see my review on that as well). Either way you will be purchasing life-altering music! But on \\"Ten\\", it's simply impossible to speak only of the \\"stand-out\\" tracks because they are ALL \\"STAND-OUTS\\"! But I can say that if you can listen to tracks like \\"ALIVE\\" and NOT feel alive and refreshed, or you can listen to \\"Black\\" and NOT get chills to last a life time, or if you can listen to \\"Jeremy\\" and NOT get a little emotional, or you can listen to \\"Release\\" and not realize you've just heard the GREATEST album closer of ALL TIME, then perhaps this album isn't for you. But if you like good, true hard rock, Pearl Jam is indeed an EXTREMELY safe bet and \\"Ten\\" or \\"VS\\" is a perfect place to start for the curious new-comer to Pearl Jam. That being said, don't listen to people who say the production on \\"Ten\\" isn't much to write home about; they are FULL OF IT!! This is by far THE most crisp, polished, and focused sounding albums out there! You've also got a classic album cover to wrap around a truly BEAUTIFUL piece of art that HAS and WILL continue to withstand the test of time! I could write another hundred pages on how this album totally rules, but you are probably getting bored with reading the same hype over and over. Just trust me and take a chance- chances are you'll love \\"Ten\\"!!!! <br />   <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|I agree with a previous post that this one sort of grows on you.  This is one of my favorite U2 albums but I wouldn't personally go quite so far as to say it's their best.  Obviously most have heard a couple tracks from the album such as \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your Own\\" but the other tracks are excellent as well.  This CD has an interesting affect on me in that some tracks remind me of the old U2 sound and others hold true to the newer music, which I think is why I like it so much.  All in all I would highly recommend this album if you are a U2 fan, I even know some non-fans who have enjoyed it immensely.  BTW I also agree that it's silly to knock the album on the basis of not liking commercials, ticket sales problems etc., buy the album and let the quality speak for itself.
B0000CC5CS|5.0|worth it when I saw it in theatres <br />the name lives up to itself <br />and the ending is quite shocking <br />because wether or not they make another T movie or not I will always like T and T2 and this one.  <br />I would like to have them make a T4 movie. but wether or not they do I will be understanding. perhaps the ending of T3 lets us know there might not be left much to tell to the rest of Judgement day with the Machines. or that there is much to learn of it and we have yet to know it all truly. we shall see which way it goes. but either way this film is amazing. has alot of comedy in it. alot of action just as much as the first and second T films. Arnold does great at playing a relentless, soldier if you will to protect Conner. I would of liked to have Furlong play the grown up version of Conner but Nick Stahl works just as well. he reproduces the way John Conner is like in T2. curious, smart ass mouth talker, dangerous, and smart all in one. I like that he can reuse what Conner has even if someone else plays his role. Kristanna Loken is sexy and scary as her role. she's the perfect female terminatrix as they call her somewhere in the movie or story. I can't wait to see the other movies she was in before this or after this movie. the whole cast is brilliant. Johnathen Mostow is just as innovative as James Cameron is with his first 2 Terminator movies. he adds just as much shock, comedy etc as Cameron did. both directors should be proud of themselves. wether Cameron would of made this or Mostow. I still would of seen it. all directors deserve a chance when they create something. so glad I got this on dvd. the Sgt. Candy scene is hilarious. and you really learn alot on disc 2 about the special effects, etc. quite a great movie. saw it 1 time in theatre. and 5 times on dvd. it will be seen more times played in my dvd player when I can watch it. rest assured people
B00005JNVA|5.0|\\"Nobody Knows,\\" a profoundly moving film from the acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda, proves that the greatest movies don't need flashy action or CGI effects to achieve significant emotional impact. Despite its immediate appearance of stripped-down starkness, it is a film of technical virtuosity and carefully orchestrated sequences. But the true heart of the film -- which is loosely based on the true story of four children abandoned by their mother in Japan in 1988 and discovered six months later -- lies in its shocking realism.<br /><br />\\"Nobody Knows\\" begins when Keiko (played by the Japanese pop star You) deserts her young children in a run-down apartment in a nameless Japanese city with barely enough money to pay the bills. Her oldest son Akira (Yuya Yagira) must fend for himself and protect his younger brother Shigeru (Hiei Kimura) and his sisters Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura) and Yuki (Momoko Shimizu). Akira tries his best to be a parent, borrowing money from dishonest family acquaintances, buying Christmas gifts for his siblings and relying on new friends for help, including the young Saki (Hanae Kan).<br /><br />Many films have captured the gritty experience of urban survival in a busy and unfriendly city, and plenty are told from the perspective of children. But unlike movies such as the recent \\"In America,\\" this story is characterized by an utter lack of sentimentality and an extraordinary subtlety. The movie merely hints at the family's past before the opening of the film -- Koreeda is wisely content to develop his characters through action without succumbing to unnecessary narration or expository dialogue.<br /><br />As such, the storyline of \\"Nobody Knows\\" is a loose framework rather than an intricate plot. With sparse dialogue and minimalist production, the film feels wholly authentic, even documentary-like (not coincidently). Koreeda actually hired unprofessional actors, working with them in free-form improvisation and filming the story chronologically. As a result, the performances are astonishingly convincing -- the actors literally age on-screen. (Yuya Yagira, a novice, won Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival.)<br /><br />Koreeda is keenly aware of the power that a slowly unfolding story can have. The film's quietness and slow pacing make the few plot developments and revelations all the more emotional. Rather than relying on dialogue, Koreeda reveals characters' emotions and thoughts in ways that many directors never attempt, through lingering smiles and exchanged glances. The intense connection to these characters and the ultimate emotional payoff at the climax are results of these stylistic choices.<br /><br />Above all, Koreeda is a brilliant visual storyteller. With his cinematographer Yamazaki Yutaka, he creates a style that perfectly complements the fly-on-the-wall nature of his movie. The camera is patiently kept in one place, and as result much of the action takes place on the edges, even outside, of the frame. Although Koreeda and Yutaka carefully plan each shot, the film's cinematography still feels experimental and beautifully authentic. Yutaka's garish lighting and the set's close quarters, emphasize the seclusion and loneliness of the children's apartment. This symbolism extends to the repeated isolation of visual patterns (Akira on staircases, for example) to demonstrate the hopelessness of the children's existence: As the children revisit old places, each time things seem worse than before.<br /><br />But, as he did with 1998's \\"After Life,\\" Koreeda finds unexpected humor and optimism even in the darkest of situations. At one point, Yuki's hilariously squeaky shoes represent the joyous privilege of leaving the house for the first time. In another scene, hand-held camera movement and rapid editing are used to show Akira's exhilaration as he watches a train pass quickly by, dreaming that one day it will take him far away.<br /><br />Too many contemporary Hollywood films are content to tellrather than show. Koreeda's authentic direction is a refreshing reminder of cinema at its quiet best. But more importantly -- and perhaps more surprisingly, given the simplicity of its style and its plot -- \\"Nobody Knows\\" is highly affecting and entirely engrossing. It also constitutes a major social statement: In the late 1980s, when the plight of the four abandoned children came to light, many Japanese were shocked that their society had ever allowed this to happen. But the film, with its patient camera work and natural storyline, make their dark fates seem all too familiar.<br /><br />(Originally published in the Yale Daily News, February 25, 2005.)ntent to tell rather than show.

B000268QB2|5.0|This is the first CD where I have liked every song the first time I heard them. And, believe me, I've bought a lot of other CD's. Usually, I have to listen to some of the songs, on other CD's, a few times before they \\"stick\\", but not with Keane!  They just have something magical going on.  Even though there are similar bands with a similar style out there, Keane stands out because of the lead singer's unique voice and the band's original musical compositions...the piano adds just the right touch. I wish them all the best and am telling all my friends about them. <br /> <br />Favorite tracks: Somewhere Only We Know and Everybody's Changing
0790731452|5.0|is one one strange funny movie <br />it has humor <br />and some very odd plot to it <br />the aliens are freaky looking <br />the whole mowie is amazing <br />the ending is very interesting <br />but I like the movie and cast of characters <br />I'll be laughing every time I watch this on my player <br />Tim Burton is just as amazing here as he was when he made Batman with Michael Keaton and Kim Basinger and Jack Nicholson among many of the great people who played in the movie
0385508417|5.0|I really enjoyed this book overall.  I recommend this book to people of all ages.  There were so many parts all the way through it that just made me laugh.  I understand the way they wanted to skip Christmas because of it saving them money, but is it worth it?  I don't think so.  Even if they don't have their daughter, skipping Christmas would be like they just wanted to forget all about it along with their great memories.  How could anyone want to do that?  Throughout the book one really sees the way people today over commercialize the Christmas season.  People buy to many decorations to put up inside and out on their house just to compete against their neighbors with who has the best looking house.  In the end, it all doesn't matter because the kranks do not forget about the Christmas spirit when their daughter Blair comes homes out of the blue.

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I cannot believe how disrespectful some of these reviewers are. <br />Here is a 72 year old icon in his last days recording some poignant songs with help from some of the biggest names in the world and I see a lot of gripeing and petulant whining.  Ray Charles (Mr. Charles to you non-believers) was one of the great pop icons of the last century.  Here he is with Norah Jones, James Taylor, Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, Natalie Cole, Elton John, B.B. King, Bonnie Raitt, Dianna Krall, Johnny Mathis, Gladys Knight and Michael McDonald pouring his soul out over smart lush and jazz-like arrangements with help from his guests all done with good taste and great respect.  Yet I see a lot of disrespect even after his life's work.  I guess we are just a cynical nation.  Charles hasn't had a big hit in years until now, he didn't do rap or heavy metal or alternative rock.  If you really believe. do yourself a favor and pay your last respects and pick up this beautiful album. Ray Charles was one of the very few individuals in popular music history that had PERFECT PITCH.  So pay no attention to those no-talent naysayers.  The only perfect pitch they understand is a high and tight fastball to your head.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|watched the trailer online <br />had to see this movie <br />bought it on dvd <br />watched it 10 times already <br />a true classic <br />it goes to show you how far your live can downfall when you get too deep into the fame and drugs. not only that it also goes to show you that it's great to be famous. but one should never let it get to their head. that and the drugs. a sick twisted, funny, moving touching movie story. Macauley Culkin is amazing in here. Seth and him are hilarious in their roles <br />the murder scene is shocking <br />the movie moved me, shocked me. and thrilled me all at once <br />it is worth the watch over and over again. if you're a fan of Culkin's see his movies
B000002ITW|1.0|21 tracks, 6 by Neil Young. Two of those are live retreads of tunes you should - if you're reading this - have elsewhere. Three of them are acoustic takes of solo tunes (one is a medley) and the last is an old Buffalo Springfield tune.     The only other high point is Crosby's intro to Triad, wherein he basically says, \\"Hey, man. Once I was nailing two chicks at the same time. I wrote a song about it, and stuff...man.\\" But you can hear all of that on the sample provided ... and Triad is now available as a bonus track on Notorious Byrd Brothers, which - if you're reading this - you should have elsewhere.    So, 4 worthwhile tracks out of 21, that's less than 20%. Sounds like 1 star to me...and I'm rounding it up.

B0007OCG56|5.0|Another reviewer here calls the movie \\"an absolute work of art encapsulating the deepest and most significanty fundamental ideas of giving up that which we love, or which we yearn to become for the sake of our children.\\" I agree. But I think it's about even more besides the mother/daughter, generational/cultural values tug-of-wars. <br /> <br />Spanglish \\"opens the serape\\" on glaring American manias and cruelties that we seem to have become blinded to: the driven, masculinized American white woman who has lost the power of feminity and unintentionally but inexorably torments herself and her family; the ethical and cultural dilemmas posed by the Grand Canyon socioeconomic divide between Anglos and Latinos. Especially in California, a Latino \\"underclass\\" props up every corner of the affluent middle-class lifestyle. Who cleans the sprawling houses, buses tables and washes dishes in restaurants, mows the lawn and tends the garden, builds the subdivions and strip malls? I could go on and on. It's a new caste system that whites, as top dogs, seem oblivious to. <br /> <br /> <br />Spanglish reveals all the messy realities with a compassionate eye, humor and visual gloss. Balancing on the tightrope between pure entertainment and profound human and social insight while making us laugh is what makes this a masterpiece. The movie's flaws, like it's characters, are ultimately forgiveable because they are so universally human. I buy few DVDs, but this will be one of them.

0553573411|5.0|I don't know why I loved reading this book so much:  The characters are either good or evil and never deviate from this, the subplots resolve themselves in a predictable fashion, and the title is ludicrous assuming it is a reference to FitzChivalry (though if it were a clever reference to Will I would excuse the misnomer).  But I simply could not put this book down.      There is no doubt that Hobb is one of the most skilled fantasy writers that I have ever had the good fortune to discover -- every time I planned on reading a chapter I would find myself reading 200 pages.  But it is more than skillful word play. The characters she creates, though steadfast to their mold, are so captivating, so likeable, that you just want to remain in their lives for a little while longer.  This must be why the book is so enthralling.      I have to recommend this book because it brought me an incredible amount of entertainment, but not without some reservations.  This book, this trilogy, may not be for everyone.
B00004BZ0V|4.0|This CD is a compilation of the band's most popular songs, and really I have to say that it is a mixed bag (some songs are good, some songs are boring). They threw songs like \\"Rock The Casbah\\" on here only because of their popularity, not because they were good Punk songs. A lot of The Clash's real Punk songs were not put on this CD, probably because they were not as popular as other songs by them that were more like other types of music, rather than Punk. There is still some good stuff on here, though. \\"London Calling\\" is obviously good. And there's also other amazing hits, like \\"Clash City Rockers\\" and \\"White Riot\\". A personal favorite of mine is \\"Tommy Gun\\". This CD shouldn't be referred to as their greatest hits, because it isn't. It should instead be referred to as their most popular hits. It is worth the money if you like a lot of the songs on it (besides the ones that aren't really Punk songs), but otherwise you'd be better off picking up a copy of \\"Londing Calling\\" (the new digitally remastered two disc version) instead of this.
0140177396|5.0|Much of John Steinbeck's fiction is set in the region where he was born and grew up, Salinas. Published in 1937, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was the previous work before his Pulitzer Winner \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Set in Salinas, the novella is set against the backdrop of Depression-era America. The main characters, Lennie and George, are workers victimized by social and economical conditions of the period.<br /><br />Steinbeck's works always received mixed reviews. He was hailed and the best writer of the 30s and 40s and received a Nobel Prize in 1962, but his critics say that his writings were superficial, sentimental, and overly moralistic. When it comes to \\"Of Mice and Men\\", many say that the narrative suffers from one-dimensional characters besides the extremely deterministic plot - that in the end its lesson turns out to be more important than the characters. Despite all these drawbacks, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is still a minor masterpiece from one of the best North-American writers.<br /><br />The predatory human nature is what feeds the pages of this book. Existentialism is the subtext when the all the characters struggle to survive in a inhospitable environment. Almost every characters admit at one point having had a profound sense of isolation and loneliness .By stating this, the writer proves that being powerful in eventual and dependable. Some characters are stronger than others most of the time, and the strength depends on to whom it is aimed. \\"Of mice and men\\" suggests that the most powerful kind of strength comes from the other's weakness.<br /><br />Another strong point raised by Steinbeck is the impossibility of the American Dream. Every character in the book dreams of a different life. They want the freedom to follow their own desires. The two main characters dream of owning a farm, that would enable them to sustain themselves and would protect them from the inhospitable world.<br /><br />To prove his point, the writer uses many symbols, most of them related to animals, like the mice that Lennie insists to keep. But the animals are always weaker than men. The puppies, for instance, represents the idea that only the stronger survives - in this case men.<br /><br />But in the end, dreams have fallen apart. The characters are different and are supposed to have realized that dreams only exist in another sphere. In the real world there is no place for them. This is the same thematic that Steinbeck would bring in many of his novels, like \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"East of Eden\\". \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a short book and a relatively easy reading, but very rewarding.mals, like the mice that Lennie insists to keep.

076790592X|1.0|What a digusting piece of utter and complete crap.  There's no other word for it...Tuesdays with Morrie is crap.  I truly cannot believe how hyped up people got about this mediocrity.  The quotes in the beginning from people whose lives it supposedly changed, were particularly sickening and I think it shows a lot about our country.  Our ability to judge quality from vomit-worthy sentimentalist \\"self-help\\", if it ever existed, is now extinct.  My brother tossed this book at me the other day muttering how great it was before he sauntered out.  I picked it up, not expecting much, and as I read my disgust deepened to the point at which I could no longer go on.  I have yet to get past page 50 and I don't think I will attempt it ever again.  What a waste of life. The guy has the writing style of a grade school kid.  Go five-word sentences!  There is no need to point out the insipid and hypocritical nature of \\"self-help\\", if you cannot figure it out yourself than you most likely enjoyed TWM and you make me sad.  Alboum should stick to his sports writing and never venture into the world of literature again.  I think it's kind of depressing that his life-changing revelation is so cliched and cardboard. When philisophers have been juggling with the meaning of life for centuries how could MA possibly presume to know it?  And put it on the front of his book like a cheap advert to catch attention. Read Emerson! Read Kundera! Read anything but this!  How on earth did this top the best seller list?      On a lighter note, I liked Morrie's dancing...
B0002X314C|4.0|I LOVE John Legend's raw, emotional VOICE and songwriting ability, i.e. nu-soul classics like ORDINARY PEOPLE that recall Donny Hathaway where he cuts close to the bone and strips it all down to vocals & piano - that's when Legend truly has the making of a LEGEND, but...I actually don't care much of Kayne West's more over-produced \\"hip hop\\" style tracks - the naked vulnerability of Legend gets smothered in sampled beats - What his label should do is re-release his own very rare, indie 2003 LIVE CD recorded in NYC at the Knitting Factory, that include many stripped-down versions of songs found in studio form here, but also should-have-been hits not included on his major-label. Still, you can't deny that Legend is the real deal, and one of the few nu-soul artists to actually earn his own name: LEGEND.
B00029LNHS|4.0|To be completely honest, I've never paid for a Black Eyed Peas album before.  I've listened to the other two albums, but I've never seen any reason to actually pay for them.  I wasn't going to buy this one either (unlike many others, I thought \\"Where Is The Love\\" was INCREDIBLY corny).  But I do play video games a lot and sometime last year I bought a game called \\"The Urbz\\" (it's like The Sims, but in the city).  Anyway, The Black Eyed Peas are heavily featured in it and they provide the majority of the soundtrack for the game.  Also, you can hear \\"Hands Up\\" on the NBA Live 2005 soundtrack.  So after humming these songs for a while and being unable to get them out of my head, I began to wonder \\"if these songs are this catchy, what does their new album sound like?\\"  Like most people, I'd already heard \\"Hey Mama\\" and \\"Let's Get It Started\\" on the radio, so it only made sense to get an album that seemed to be so infectious.<br /><br />Upon first listen, I'd have to say that I was very pleased with what I heard.  Tracks like \\"Shut Up\\", \\"Hey Mama\\", \\"Labor Day\\", \\"Latin Girls\\", and \\"Let's Get It Started\\" are amazing dance tracks.  If you're playing the wall at the club, those songs will get you off of it.  I also have to say that it's VERY refreshing to hear some top 40 pop rap that doesn't have the tired cars, ice, money, and hoes theme to it.  I REALLY appreciate that.  Just about every song on the album is great for dancing to.  And when they change pace (The Apl Song) they still manage to keep it moving without skipping a beat.  And for the hypersensitive (see below) there's an amended version of \\"Let's Get Retarded\\".  Honestly, \\"I Like Let's Get It Started\\" a lot more only because that was the version I heard and came to like first.  And is it me, or does \\"Let's Get Started\\" have different/better production to it?<br /><br />As dope as the album is, there are times where the album can slow down or become downright boring.  Like I said earlier \\"Where Is The Love\\" has a great message and is incredibly catchy, but it's still VERY formulaic and corny.  Also, \\"Anxiety\\" seems a little out of place with all of these other dance tracks.  And I have to say that the bonus track (the one after \\"Let's Get It Started\\"...I'll call it \\"Foolin' Me\\" for now) is somewhat boring.  Other than that, I can't really find anything wrong with this album.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, it's good to hear some pop rap that isn't about drugs, guns, cars, ice, money, hoes, and pimping.  It's also nice to hear some original production.  Speaking of production, I have to say that I was totally surprised to see that Will.I.Am produced the ENTIRE album (with the exception of \\"The Apl Song\\" which was produced by Apl himself).  Though he tends to bite A Tribe Called Quest every now and then, he's still a VERY talented producer.  I didn't know that about him.  And even though Fergie isn't much of a singer, she adds a dimension to the group that wasn't present on their previous albums.  I'd have to say that if you want to get away from typical rap, then this album should do the trick.  You'll dance for the whole hour that the album plays.  Go pick this one up, I highly reccomend it.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: Shut Up, Hands Up, Hey Mama (My Favorite), Latin Girls, Where's The Love, Let's Get It Started, Labor Day (It's A Holiday), and Sexy<br /><br />P.S. - If you're offended by the title \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" chances are that you didn't give the song much of a listen.  To \\"get retarded\\" means to wild out on the dance floor and have a great time at a party (Will even says to \\"wild out\\" in the song).  I'm getting really sick of the overly sensitive whiners that complain at every given opportunity (we're overly sensitive as a country, but that's an entirely different issue).  Do as Fergie suggests and \\"Shut Up\\" for once.  Anyone with two fully functional ears and just a little bit of common sense can tell that B.E.P. aren't trying to make fun of retarded people.  Itwould be \\"retarded\\" (pun intended) for anyone to even suggest that they are.  Open your ears and your minds, people.nyone to even suggest that they are.  Open your ears and your minds, people.
B0000009SF|5.0|\\"The Grand Wazoo\\"-5 stars  <br />Instead of a paragraph, I'll give a track-by-track analysis. <br />1. \\"The Grand Wazoo\\" <br />    Frank switched this one and \\"For Calvin\\" to make the title track first, and it's a good thing he did. But more about that later. This track is, in fact, a collection of solos--very jazz influenced solos--put together in an upbeat track. The trombone shines, second only to the guitar solos (one by FZ, another one on bottleneck). Overall a great opening track. <br />2. \\"For Calvin (And His Next Two Hitch-Hikers)\\" <br />    The title is based on a story by Cal Schenkel (he did the cover for this albuma and many others), and works best in the second slot. Much slower than \\"Grand Wazoo,\\" it's a nice drop from the energy of the former song. The only track with full-blown vocals, it's still a nice track. A la slow jazz, \\"For Calvin\\" is what I call \\"the one you can dance to\\" for it has that perfect tempo where it doesn't change and stays nice and easy. Think \\"prom dance gone wrong\\" tempo. Great track, again. <br />3. \\"Cletus Awreetus-Awrightus\\" <br />    My favorite track. The theme repeated throughout the song will stay in your mind for days upon end. Again, trombones shine in the first run through of the theme. With \\"vocals\\" (it's just \\"la-la-la\\" and \\"rum-pum-PUM\\") singing the theme at the end, Zappa really showcases his \\"wonderful voice\\" (as he called in in his authbiography). The tenor sax solo will blow any listener away not only for its technical difficulty, but for the way the octave key is so effortlessly used (if you know about the sax, then you'll get this). Much to my dismay, a score isn't available from Barfko-Swill for this one. [Note: Spring this one on a dissenter of FZ, then see if they still agree to disagree.] <br />4. \\"Eat That Question\\" <br />    Replace \\"question\\" with a certain religious group that Romans fed to large felines. There's the original title. Anywho, Don Preston's piano really pops out in the opening and later on, and  yet another theme will haunt you for days. A bit more of a straightforward \\"jazz\\" piece, \\"...Question\\" features great trumpets and overall brass. Woodwinds still come out, but aren't as incredible as brass. This one is just perfect. <br />5. \\"Blessed Relief\\" <br />    The finale. Words cannot describe this one. Just beautiful. Sit back and enjoy this one, maybe with one of those pesky dissenters, then spring the FZ trick again. <br />    If you don't have \\"Hot Rats,\\" then I highly suggest that you purchase that with or directly after \\"...Wazoo.\\" \\"Hot Rats\\" shows the roots of this album, and \\"Waka/Jawaka\\" (plus it has \\"Little Umbrellas\\" and \\"Peaches En Regalia\\"). Not a single second wasted on this album, nor any other albums in the full catalogue of FZ.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|It's about time they released this. I've been waiting for this for a long time. Now the wizard has to come out on dvd and my life will be complete.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|The edge of reason is much funnier than the first bridget jones. I loved the fight scene and her in Jail! It's the hardest i have laughed at a movie in a long time!
B0006M4SO6|2.0|I won't repeat all the opinions expressed in the other two \\"negative\\" reviews of this recording but I think the only thing original in The Way Up is that the songs are long enough to somewhat hide the fact they've all been done by Metheny before. It's just not interesting and seems a waste of much talent.
B000002N2Z|5.0|The Deftones' first album, Adrenaline, is unique in that none of their other albums have quite the same sound.  This album is edgy, straight rock, while their newer CDs, such as White Pony and their self titled album, are directed more towards electronic techniques and vocal tricks.  In fact, if you listened to their first album and their last album one right after another, unless you were a diehard Deftones fan, it is doubtful that you could tell the two were by the same artist. Songs such as \\"Lifter\\" and \\"Root\\" are great examples of the trademark Deftones sounds, with great guitar riffs and the cool breathy vocals of Chino Moreno that are found on any Deftones CD.  The lyrics on this album are wonderful because they are thought provoking, interesting, and emotional while still being completely metal.  The lyrics are similar on other albums, what changes is the style that they are delivered.  The Deftones are my favorite band because they are so unique, so innovative, so unafraid to try new things.  They always have something new to delight the listener and make them think about, and that is exactly what I look for, and what I hope others look for, in an artist.  There is honestly no one I would compare them with, they are one of a kind and always will be in my book.  After listening to Adrenaline, I would definitely recommend buying Around the Fur.  All in all, this CD is a great one to have in your collection and in your CD player... Enjoy!
B000002UAR|5.0|It cannot be denied - this is the best album by the best rock band. Despite overdubs, solo efforts and studio trickery, this is the last time they sounded like a tight, live band making a record. Strats and Casinos crunching, Paul's '64 Rickenbacker bass (his recording bass of choice, replacing the Hofner starting with the single \\"Rain/Paperback Writer\\" and album \\"Rubber Soul\\", as well as being seen in \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", and the bass he used with Wings), overdriven, his playing and imaginative lines miles ahead of other bass players. <br /> <br /> Anyone who doubts Ringo to be one of the greatest rock drummers need only to listen to \\"She Said, She Said\\" (not to mention non-Revolver tunes such as \\"Rain\\", Ticket To Ride\\", and even their \\"Long Tall Sally\\" cover). Who else played so imaginatively? Ever try getting any drummer you know to play some of his licks? They become flummoxed!  <br /> <br /> \\"Taxman\\" rocks, Paul taking the lead solo on this song written by George. Guitars throughout this album drip with tone, tone, tone! Their next best album for guitar tone in my opinion is their first (the one with \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and Twist And Shout\\"), when they were fresh from Hamburg and the Cavern and their guitars wouldn't even tune properly! That's Rock and Roll!!!   <br /> <br />But I digress...\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", John's preview of the psychedelic era to come, still sounds state of the art, and could easily fit into a modern college radio's techno/ambient/house playlist. McCartney and Abbey Road studio engineers are manipulating tape loops by hand to make recorded laughter sound like seagulls chanting on this song. <br /> <br /> After recording this album, they went on to record \\"Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane\\", originally to be included on their next album, \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", instead released as their next single. A logical bridge between these two albums.  <br /> <br /> A lot of people consider \\"Abbey Road\\" their finest, but for me the consistancy of song quality as well as the overall sound itself (recorded on more modern equipment, producing too much studio \\"sheen\\") of \\"Abbey Road\\" cause me to disagree. In my eyes, \\"Revolver\\" is their, indeed the world's, best rock album.
B0002KVUKW|4.0|this was a very fun movie too watch. that has alot of scenes that were enjoyable. and hugh jackman is mad tight in this movie.
0345457684|4.0|A good fast read.   <br /> <br />Richard Morgan takes Kovacs, his protagonist through an amazingly imagined 25th century roller coaster ride planet jumping planets to \\"earth\\" where we find him playing detective trying to unravel a case with more layers than an onion.  Morgan's creation of the 25th century sounds perfectly believable and it's 20th century references make our world today feel almost quaint and innocent!  With few sources of \\"death\\" mankind seems poised to live forever, exchanging damaged, older bodies for healthy new ones (re-sleeving), the world becomes increasingly difficult to tell who's who and what one's agendas are.   <br /> <br />Morgan takes the classic hardboiled detective novel and spins it on its ear in a world, I'm not certain I want to live long enough to be a part of.  But I'm picking out a new sleeve, just in case!   <br /> <br />Though very well written, be forewarned there is graphic stuff on every level including violence and sexuality that may put off some readers.  For those who can \\"handle\\" it - you're in for a great ride - er, I mean read!
B000001GKC|4.0|On the subject of Bruckner's 7th Symphony, composed after Bruckner perceived the impending death of his hero Richard Wagner and indeed appropriating the very Wagner tubas into the score in the Adagio which was apparently directly inspired by Bruckner's encounter with Wagner, it would be a disservice to the recorded versions of this work not to include this CD which proved to be Herbert von Karajan's valedictory recording.<br /><br />Though the actual performance with the Vienna Philharmonic is not fully uplifting or illuminating, it does suggest the obeisance many of the great conductors of the romantic repertoire had for Bruckner.  There is a communication with the spirit of Bruckner that haunts this recording, and to make the complete circle of dealing with Brucker's mighty 7th, this recording deserves a careful hearing.  Grady Harp, February 2005
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Usually, when a band puts out a greatest hits album, it has more than four albums from which to draw.  But GnR only put out four LPs during their all-too-brief reign as the Kings of Rock. (Although GnR's official website claims that Chinese Democracy should be released by April of 2005, that's tough to believe considering that Axl has been promising to release it for eight years.  And even if they do pull things together, the band just will never be the same without Slash, Duff and Izzy.  Couldn't those guys just hire a therapist like Metallica did?  Velvet Revolver just does not do it for me.)  Tracks should really only have been taken from three of their four albums for this compilation--their final album, The Spaghetti Incident, was nowhere near up to snuff.  So if you want to purchase some GnR music, you have two options (other than downloading it): you can either pick up Appetite for Destruction and Use Your Illusions I and II, or you could buy this compilation album.  While it does cost more to purchase those three, that's really the better way to go: this album is missing at least three key cuts--Mr. Brownstone, Night Train and Estranged--and the last four songs on the album are only average.   <br />One more thing--there's nothing wrong with covering a classic; GnR's take on Knockin' on Heaven's Door is better than the original (and considering that it's a Dylan piece, that's saying a lot) and they did a good job on Live and Let Die (which is not a Beatles song, as Mr. Odea claims, but is rather a single that McCartney recorded with his post-Beatles band Wings).  But the boys' version of Sympathy for the Devil is just shoddy.  It does not help that this ranks as one of the Rolling Stones' greatest songs (if not their best ever).  The lesson is clear: don't try to compete with the greatest work by the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World. (Okay, I know that the Stones no longer deserve that title, but they certainly did when Beggars Banquet was released.)<br />Should you buy this album?  No.  Even if you don't want to spend the money on their first three albums, at least buy Appetite For Destruction and download the cuts from UYI I and II that appear on this greatest hits album (plus Estranged).  Most of the songs on this album are amazing, but you'd be better off purchasing the entire GnR collection (minus The Spaghetti Incident).  Start with AFD.  It's amazing.
0553103547|5.0|Ye gods.<br /><br />That's just about all one can say upon completion of \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" the first book in George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  Amazed, aghast, and astounded, I am bereft, wondrously spent.<br /><br />Where to begin?  \\"A Game of Thrones\\" may be read as a fantastic parallel to the historical English civil war between the Houses of York and Lancaster, but the novel truly stands on its own.<br /><br />Martin plops the reader down into a world recovering from a titanic civil war.  Robert the Usurper is now King Robert, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms that comprise a land that bears a strong resemblance of England.  But this is a land of warlords, where knights wear fantastic, regal armor and clash at the drop of a hat.  The land itself is martial, what with geographic names such as \\"the Trident,\\" \\"the Bite,\\" and \\"the Bloody Gate.\\"  And Robert is ill-suited to govern his unruly warlords (after all, these are the men who fought a civil war -- a strong hand is needed to keep these guys in line), and is more suited to the hunt than the throne.<br /><br />The Starks and the Lannisters are two of the leading noble families in the realm, and like the two bullies on the block, sooner or later they are going to have to fight.  The Starks, who rule the Northlands, epitomize all the traits of nobility and loyalty (including, to their sorrow, a bit of naivete), while the Lannisters bring a realpolitik ruthlessness to their worldview.<br /><br />Simultaneously, the \\"dragonspawn\\" heirs of the recently toppled king have fled across the sea to the land of the Dothraki, where the brother hopes to raise an army by wedding his sister to a Ghengis Khan clone.  While occupying far fewer pages in this massive novel than the Stark-Lannister intrigues, this subplot is no less riveting.<br /><br />And perhaps most ominously of all, \\"winter is coming.\\"  In the Seven Kingdoms, summers and winters can last for years, and a long winter is on the horizon.  And along with this winter are harbingers of the Others, who are fearsome undead creatures who live in the northern wastelands beyond the Wall -- sort of the Great Wall of England, made almost entirely out of ice.<br /><br />The great fantasy series plop the reader down into a fully realized world with its own history and mythology.  George R.R. Martin has created the most vividly realized alternate world since Tolkien created Middle Earth, and his novel soars because of it.<br /><br />You'll find it all here.  Romance, warfare, humor, grief, intrigue, deceit, murder, salvation, love, and betrayal . . . all set between the book-ends of an ominous prologue and a wondrous final chapter that will have you eagerly diving into Book 2, \\"A Clash of Kings.\\"<br /><br />As a character in the tale says, \\"in the game of thrones, you win or you die.\\"  Martin has indeed created a world and characters worth fighting and dying for.  This is one hell of a read!izon.

B000002TLX|5.0|In November of 1997, just seven months after releasing Flesh & Bone, Richard Marx released his sixth album entitled simply, GREATEST HITS. This album, which has turned out to be Richard's first greatest hits compilation, features all of Richard's hits from 1987 to early 1997, covering the albums: RICHARD MARX, REPEAT OFFENDER, RUSH STREET, PAID VACATION, & FLESH & BONE. This greatest hits album does more than live up to its name; it stands as one of Richard Marx's best albums ever.    DON'T MEAN NOTHING    From the album Richard Marx (1987). Definitely a great song and an cult classic. This is about the only song that my father likes from Richard Marx. My father has a lot to learn about Richard. Give me time, I'll have my father turn into a Richard Marx fan soon.    ENDLESS SUMMER NIGHTS    From the album Richard Marx (1987). This song, which was a #2 hit, is even better than Don't Mean Nothing. I can't help, but continue to play this song over and over again. It's amazing at how I play this song over and over, and my copy still hasn't worn itself out yet.    NOW AND FOREVER    From the album Paid Vacation (1994). Aside from Richard's vocals being incredible, the music was not to my liking and that is why I refuse to like this song.    SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER    From the album Richard Marx (1987). This is one hell of a song, and one of my absolute favorites. A classic Richard Marx song all the way.    ANGELIA    From the album Repeat Offender (1989). One of my favorite Richard Marx power ballads. Richard has even said that this was one of his favorites. I think what made this a favorite for Richard was that he came up with the idea after finding that the title was the name of a flight attendant, who served Richard some soda on a flight to Texas. How Richard comes up with these songs, I'll never know.    HOLD ON TO THE NIGHTS    From the album Richard Marx (1987). This was Richard's first #1 hit, and it was one of the first songs I had heard and liked from RichardMarx. Definitely an ultimate classing Richard Marx hit.    ANGEL'S LULLABY    New Song. The first single from the album. Richard had written this song for his three sons: Jesse, Brandon, & Lucas. This ballad is one hell of a heartfelt one and it most deserves the spot on this greatest hits compilation.    TAKE THIS HEART    From the album Rush Street (1991). I enjoy this song so much because it sounds like the material Richard had provided on his Repeat Offender album, which is my favorite Richard Marx album.    SATISFIED    From the album Repeat Offender (1989). Richard Marx's second #1 hit single. I really love this song. Basically because it just says that we shouldn't stop going for something until we are \\"Satisfied\\".     UNTIL I FIND YOU AGAIN    From the album Flesh & Bone (1997). A beautiful heartfelt ballad that sounds very much like the material featured on the first album. A song no fan should skip over. Richard has said that this is a song that he had written in case he and actress, Cynthia Rhodes ended in divorce.    HAZARD (THE RIVER)    From the album Rush Street (1991). Now, the Rush Street album is another favorite Richard Marx album of mine, because this song is from that album and this song is my favorite Richard Marx song. I had already heard the songs Right Here Waiting and Hold On To The Nights. I had liked those two songs, but I did not become a fan until I heard this song. This my absolute favorite Richard Marx song.    THE WAY SHE LOVES ME    From the album Paid Vacation (1994). Great song.    KEEP COMING BACK    From the album RUSH STREET (1991). Another one of my favorite ballads from Richard Marx. This is a song that everybody should favor.    CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT    From the album Repeat Offender (1989). My favorite song of the Repeat Offender album. This should have also been a #1 hit because it was inspired by many kids who have lived hard lives, such as being abused by parents, or seriously teased by cruel-hearted people.    TOUCH OFHEAVEN    From the album Flesh & Bone (1997). Not bad.    RIGHT HERE WAITING    From the album Repeat Offender (1989). This is another song that Richard had written for his wife, Cynthia Rhodes. He has stated that he had no intentions of releasing it, since it was a personal song for he and Cynthia. But was convinced by a close friend to release it. Richard had no idea the song would become a major hit. When I first heard this song, I was not crazy about it at all. But when I became a big fan of Richard Marx, I gave the song another chance, and the song really took effect on me. This is one hell of a song.        This greatest hits compilation is worthy of your money spending days. So, if you have the money, and must have the money, buy this album because it is outstandingly incredible.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Nearly everyone at work is quoting this movie, and after being asked 100 times if I've seen Napolean Dynamite, I finally rented it.  I found it a little easier to comprehend than Rushmore as far as off-beat character movies go, and there were some funny moments in the film.  I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't put it in my top ten list of funny movies.      Someone mentioned that this movie is so stupid it's funny.  I don't know if that could accurately describe it, because I didn't think the movie was stupid.  It has a very deadpan style about a high school nerd and his friends, his 32 year old brother and his scheming Uncle and their daily lives.  You'll note that the \\"popular crowd\\" or \\"anti-heros\\" are jovial personality-wise while everyone else seems half-stoned, half concerned and half asleep.  Napolean intersperses his flatliner demeanor with the occasional \\"Fine!\\" or \\"Idiots!\\"  Those are probably the most quotable parts of the movies.  No cosmic intelletual themes in here which is nice.  None of the cliched high school expressions of wanting a girlfriend yet still an interesting angle at getting a girl go to the dance with you.   Just every day high school stuff in an 80s flavor.
B00006AFUR|5.0|At first, I didn't realize Jared Leto was the lead vocals until I saw the Capricorn video.  Not only a good actor in the right roles but a great singer with the sense to explore his musical talent along with his brother. <br />I discovered a little late just how good this band was when I heard \\"Echelon\\" at the end credits of the movie \\"The Core\\".  The song reeled me in and I was anxious to see all the credits roll until seeing the band name at the end.   <br />I am so glad my curiousity got the best of me, because this is now one of my favorite bands and can't wait until the next CD release.
B000003TSP|5.0|This album is almost a soundtrack of a fictive movie Noir. Let me say first that I like this second, self-titled album by Portishead even more then their ground-breaking debut 'Dummy'.  <br /> <br />Sssh! The movie is about to start... <br />It's night. The creepy silence is giving you shivers. Suddenly a man appears.. 'Cowboys' is starting in the background. The creepy intro and Beth's voice cut into your flesh.  Now you see the man's face covered with blood. It seems like he's on the run for someone or something. The volume of 'Cowboys' is rising every second. The man looks right, then left. Did he see a man standing in the shadows over there? The man starts running. He's hearing footsteps following him. Suddenly someone grabs him by the arm and pulls him into a building. They got him. The building seems to be a stiptease-bar. The enjoyable 'All Mine' starts playing. It's pleasant, yet also very dark, just like the bar. A man sitting in the corner talks to him. He says that he needs to get his money back, but it seems like the poor guy doesn't have any. While 'Undenied' is playing in the background they beat him up and torture him. Afterwords they throw him in a dark, mysterious room. He can't see anything, he can only hear something. It seems like there's some kind of radio in the room. It's playing 'Half Day Closing' on mid-volume. It scares the man. He wants to get out of there immediately. After a few tries he gets out of the building. It's cold and creepy outside. No lights, only the moon. The scary, but also mysterious'Over' is played. He hears voices inside of the building, they must have already discovered he escaped. He starts running again, with the song 'Over' buzzing in his head. He stops running when he sees an old, spooky house that seems empty. He opens the door and enters the house. When the door shuts, you hear 'Humming' in the background. He's in an extremely dark hall. He gets upstairs. All the windows are opened and a fresh 'Mourning Air' flewstruh the windows. He looks out of one of the windows. He sees some shadows moving in the garden. He gets out of the house as quickly as possible. The sounds of 'Seven Months' echo in the background. He's running truh the streets and steals a car. He drives as fast as he can. He puts on the radio and 'Only You' is being playing on the radio. The sound relaxes him a bit, but it's quite spooky.  <br />Suddenly he gets a flat tire and moves over. He sees some cars coming close, he has been followed. He runs into the forest. But some men grab him and throw him on the ground. 'Elysium' starts playing. One man talks. 'You have to pay. If it's not with money then it's with your life'. 'We warned you, Port!' says another man. The man takes a knife, grabs Port and cuts off his head. His head falls on the ground, with his eyes pointing to the west. The tunes of 'Western Eyes' end the movie. The Movie is called Port's Head.
B0002X314C|5.0|This CD is awesome start to finish!!  John's music is so original, it's like no other!!  I listen to it at work, while sitting in traffic, while cleaning, cooking, et al!  By the CD, you will just love it!!
B000000OQF|5.0|This album is so increadible. In my opinion it is the greatest rock album of the 80's 90's and now. I listen to it everyday.        songs like Mr. brownstone,paradise city nightrain and all the rest are increadible hard rock songs with slash's amazing guitar solos and axl sweet vocals. The dual guitar sound is really nice after listening to it. To me this album really stands out because its so raw and it rocks so hard. If your have any doubt about getting this cd forget about it and go pick this up and you will not be disapointed.For Those who gave this album less than 5 stars its is very clear that they ARE musically changelled and should spend their time writing 5 star reviews for milli vanill. Just listen to wut they are sayin, Gnr were nothin but a hair metal band like cinderalla and poison. WHAT Do u have ears. Like the rolling stones in the 60's aerosmith in the 70's in the 80's guns n roses ripped through hair and brought dirty sleazy Rock N' Roll to the Masses. Those same kids are still talkin about the lack of complexity? What? Who the @*** Cares? If a band writes amazing songs with 3 chords (which guns dosen't the chords changes are meaningful and the melodies great stick in your head and the greatest guitar solos ever) who cares in u can write a song in 5/14 time and use this scale here and this one there. I have friends who are all impresed when the drummer switches to a diffent time signature while the guitars stay in 4/4 and the melodies and the guitar parts aren't memorable and the songs aren't any good. Guns N' Roses are what they are. No more no less a Rock N' Roll Band. They Are Not a metal band, Hair metal band, or any other stupid name people can dream up for Rock N roll. Guns were the rolling stones, aerosmith, sexpistols, new york dolls, alice cooper, ramones, yardbirds,led zeppelin and pretty much every other great rock band ever rolled into one. Buy this album unless u are a complete idiot you will Love this album
B0002OERI0|1.0|I wish there was a note on the product detail section that this cd was a Digital Restricted Media.  I wouldn't have bought it if I had known. I bought this cd because I thought songs sounded interesting.  Then I found out I can't listen to it on my laptop, I can't listen to it in the car, I can't convert the music to mp3 to listen to it on my IPod while I workout.  Basically, it's an useless  $13 item to me. <br />It's going to be the last cd I'm buying from Green Day or Warner Music.
0316666343|1.0|It is depressing.  and the last 3rd of the book is utterly ridiculous.  Ugh, don't bother reading this, not worth the time.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Yes, this cd is very good.  It reaches towards a pinnacle of intensity that has got to be near the limits of just how massive and devastating a standard metal setup could sound.  That is not exactly a compliment in and of itself, but it is worth mentioning.  This album seems to mark a substantial change, as the one Converge album I have that predates this is 'Petitioning the Empty Sky', and while that is a very good, very heavy album, it is still basically just another metalcore album.  This album is still metalcore, though that term doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot, but it definitely isn't just another metalcore album.<br /><br />Frankly, quite a few of the songs on this album sound pretty much the same as one another. But, this album isn't seems to be less a collection of songs than a collection of different sounds, as they mix doomy, blaring wall of sound riffs with squealing post-hardcore noises with thick, choppy groove riffs, all overlaid with some distinctive, unpredictable drumming and Bannon's distorted, inhuman shrieks.(perhaps the most insance vocal performance I've ever heard)  Converge realized that merely having 'extreme' vocals mixed really loud doesn't make you heavy, and that it's in fact counter productive.  The mix is all guitars and bass, with the shrieking vox buried in the ocean of sound, and the drums just kinda thudding underneath.  This is a very well produced album, raw but still reasonably clear allowing their impeccable musicianship to shine through.  Converge display an emotional, tonal sensitivity almost unheard of in a band this heavy.  The album mostly moves from sad to angry, but it can do both convincingly, and even has moments of triumph, such as the very end of the album.<br /><br />Though the album is not purely song-oriented, to me anyway, there are a number of definite standouts.  'Concubine' and 'Fault and Fracture' open the album with unrelenting intensity, with the blastbeat-esque parts of 'Concubine' being perhaps the most fierce, intense moments on the album.  'Hell to Pay' is a moment of relative calm, with more distanced, unrefined clean vox and a droning, unending bassline underlying the verses, until the song picks up into a doomy wall of sound at the end.  'Homewrecker' is the catchiest thing on here, with great punk energy in the verses, and groovy pre-chorus (no love, no hope) and an instantly memorable yet still completely indecipherable chorus.  'The Broken Vow' nicely encapsulates all the sounds of the album, with the speedy opening, a somewhat more subdued middle part with some clean vox finally closing with a headbanging, mosh riff and some repetitious, chanting vox.  'Phoenix in Flight' starts out punishingly slow and sorrowful, though it picks up a bit at the end.  The title track is probably the best thing here.  A bit repetitious at times, but still compelling for the whole 11 1/2 minutes, and with Bannon's best, most powerful and dynamic vocal performance.  It closes with a devastatingly beautiful and intense instrumental section, which I've heard compared to Godspeed You Black Emperor.(quite aptly, though I think Weakling is an even better comparison.)<br /><br />I find that I'm having a tough time describing why this album is so great, but trust me it is.  With this album, along with 'You Fail Me' Converge stand alongside Mastodon and Dillinger Escape Plan as the peak of the extreme music scene in the new millennium.  Oh yeah, and the artwork is real nice too.ost fierce, intense moments on the album.

0385510454|2.0|The trouble with the newest Grisham book is that it's boring until near the end when I couldn't put it down.  Which was only for one chapter and even then it was like, \\"He should have been killed by the spies five minutes ago\\"............ <br /> <br />I love most of his books but this was a waste of money and time although I did learn that Italians don't drink cappaccinos after a certain hour and I can order an espresso in a cafe! <br />Wow.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|I was not raised on Ray Charles the Genius, I was raised on Ray Charles the guy in Pepsi Commercials and the Opening Credits to Designing Women. I've realized over the past three or four years as I've listened to his body of work that I've missed out on some gorgeous music.  <br /> <br />I wasn't expecting this album to be so good, I was expecting it to be just OK. But Ray Charles' voice its fraught with emotion in such a haunting way on this album. Just listen to the sample of \\"Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word\\" and try not to be heartbroken by his voice. This is great lazy Sunday afternoon music. The Duet element is interesting, though on a few of the songs I wish it was just Ray. Still, this album is worthy of every word of praise it gets.
B00005JKN9|4.0|I don't see how people are saying this isn't a great film. This is most deff. a classic of our time! I agree, it is kind of long and violent, but it has to be to give the \\"full effect\\". I recommend seeing this, all-in-all it's a great movie.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|(*****) for the Japanese-language track on this long-awaited Region 1 release of Kurenai no buta on DVD. Compared to grey- and black-market DVDs and VHSs to which Miyazaki fans have had to resort, this new DVD mastering and cleanup with remastered soundtrack is wonderful. Bravo, well done!    ( ****) for this Disney-fied English-track leg-lift aimed at North Americans! Judging by soundtrack \\"enhancements\\", dramatic-element telegraphing and noticeable character & plot alterations, we-all Yanks must be too stupid to understand what Miyazaki-san originally had in mind. And apparently only name-brand vocal stars will get us into theaters.    While the English track of this DVD fares much better than Disney's recent release of Nausica of the Valley of the Wind, there are still bones to pick. Why does the Pig (well-voiced here by Michael Keaton) no longer threaten (bluff) to kill all the air pirates when they're holding some kids hostage? Why does the Pig demand that these seven-year old girls (who now belong to a swim \\"club\\" instead of a swim team), wet but sunning themselves in their underwear after escaping from their captors, put their clothes back on? And why did they make Madame Gina (normally calm, supremely self-assured and patient) relatively temperamental, insecure, and girlish?    One inexcusable point: the lovely French song Gina sings early on was rerecorded and rearranged, evidently by a poor excuse for a Las Vegas lounge singer, dripping with distasteful American-style sloppy emoting. A nasty change, and unwarranted.    Questionable translations, plot surgery and gratuitous tinkering-by-focus group have made some elements a bit of a concern for Miyazaki purists, but thankfully the story's mostly unchanged. I still hate when Disney sneaks in \\"fill-in\\" dialog when characters' backs are turned. Why can't a longing gaze at the sunset remain just that?    I can recommend this to anyone over about eight years old. The themes are mostly adult, and there are situations of threat, suspense, lots of gunfire, and slapstick violence. Not for small children, but then again not as intense as Princess Mononoke or Nausica of the Valley of the Wind.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Franz Ferdinand is a wonderful band that will clearly have staying power. Filled with wonderfully catchy tracks, their self-titled album will not be a waste of your time or your money. While some claim that the album is \\"boring\\" and contains near-identical tracks, that is not the case. The band just has a specific flavor to it, one that you will either love or at least mildly enjoy. There's a reason there's so much fuss surrounding this group, why not find out why for yourself?
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|(*****) for the Japanese-language track on this long-awaited Region 1 release of Kaze no Tane no Naushika on DVD. Compared to grey- and black-market DVDs and VHSs to which Miyazaki fans have had to resort, this new DVD mastering and cleanup with remastered Hisaishi soundtrack is like a newly-polished gem. Bravo, and about time!    (  **1/2) for this boo-hiss Disney-fied English-track mess foisted on North Americans! Judging by the mangled pronunciations, soundtrack \\"enhancements\\", dramatic-element telegraphing and noticeable character & plot alterations, we-all Yanks must be too stupid to understand what Miyazaki-san originally had in mind. Or maybe, like other Disney repackagings, somebody really, totally missed the point and just doesn't \\"get\\" the original story and presentation.    Bizarre changes abound:  -Since when did Ohmu become \\"Ohm\\"?  -The God Warrior has been renamed \\"Giant Warrior\\" -- why, so deists & theists wouldn't be offended?  -Why oh why is the city-state of Pejitei (peh-jee-tay) pronounced pedge-ite?  -Why is Nausica voiced by an actress with a vocal palette of sobs, anger, and monotone?  -Why was Yupa to choose the name of a child without first being asked to be her godfather?    Extra soundtrack compositions intrude constantly, spoiling the dramatic feel of what were tender or sad/dramatic moments. Evidently nature abhores a vacuum; so do obtuse soundtrack directors.    Insufficient voice talent coaching and direction (except for Patrick Stewart), questionable translations, elective plot surgery and gratuitous tinkering-by-focus group have made this an annoying, shameful product. Not as bad as \\"Warriors of the Wind\\", maybe, but in the same spirit, if not extent.    I can recommend this to anyone over about ten years old. The themes are mostly adult, and the situations of extreme violence, threat, death and loss are pretty intense. Despite the Disney veneer and American kid-vid standards, this is just not for the kiddies.
0062502182|5.0|I picked up this book while traveling and it was just a perfect book for me at the time. Paul Cohelo writes of the journey of a young man and a teacher of life, or 'an alchemist.'    I realize that some may view this story as very simplistic or even a boring read. I myself found it fascinating from my lived experience of viewing 'life as journey.' I recall one of my college teachers years ago speaking of Kierkegaard and his writings on Purity of Heart As The Will to Live One Thing. Cohelo's story has rekindled my interest in that theme as well as some of the themes that Don Juan in the Carlos Castenada series addresses to his student.    An excellent and thought provoking book not to be rushed despite its brevity.  Daniel J. Maloney, Saint Paul, Minnesota USA
B00013F38K|5.0|\\"Kung Fu\\" is one of the best television Westerns ever done. I was 22 when the series started in 1972, just at the best age to appreciate the amazing confluence of Eastern ideas placed into a wild Western setting.<br /><br />However, after viewing this series - the second season - on DVD, the force of it is even more obvious.<br /><br />Now, I am in agreement with those who condemn the aspect ratio editing; a TV show - unless filmed originally in widescreen should be shown in the stand TV 'full screen' format. However, the DVD sets are better than nothing at all.<br /><br />I also agree that Bruce Lee was ill treated by the producers of \\"Kung Fu.\\" However, Bruce Lee died in the summer of 1973! And how did he die? A film star known the world over, whose films are still regarded as seminal within the genre. Besides, as one who has mingled in the Hollywood (of the late 70s, when things changed to an extent) milieu, writers, actors, directors, et al, get cheated and ignored all the time. Sure, race can be part of the theft or mistreatment, but \\"Hollywood\\"  is a cut throat place all too often, where there is no 'rule book' on anything. So, would the critics of the alleged racism and mistreatment of Bruce Lee rather have had him do only the first season of \\"Kung Fu\\" before he died, or become the world renowned martial artist whose legend has endured for over three decades after his death? The answer is obvious! They didn't kill him, they made him a legend! There are just too many moral lepers with too much power in \\"Hollywood\\", and yet, there are also people like Spielberg, Paul Newman, the Reiners, Ron Howard, who are as close to solid gold as it gets in this life. \\"Hollywood\\" is just not the place to go expecting justice; the whole film and television industry is based on relatively temporary general popularity, not the ethical treatment of those involved in making the 'product.' A lot of the decisions that are made have strong social components - people who have worked together on other efforts - rather than just artistic perspectives in common. Anything from \\"Hollywood\\" is a collaborative effort of people whose careers live and die on the whims of the general public... and it makes everyone involved skittish or edgy and often cynical. Too much is out of control, so they tend to go with what seems safe (for them) or what the 'execs' or the bag men (follow the money trail) require. The people in \\"Hollywood\\" know how unstable their work is and they expect others to know that as well. It's quicksand.<br /><br />That \\"Hollywood\\" could have produced such a fine series as \\"Kung Fu\\" deserves praise, not condemnation over the fate of Bruce Lee in a TV series.<br /><br />Now, to anyone with martial arts training, the first season in particular was almost amusing because so much of the martial arts had to be supported by slowing down the camera speed and using unusual angles to hide the inabilities of David Carradine. Over the course of the three years, Carradine did improve greatly, though he was never going to be in the same class as Lee.<br /><br />Carradine was the perfect choice, martial arts skills aside, to convey the message of the creators of \\"Kung Fu.\\" He made \\"Kung Fu\\" his series in a way that I doubt Bruce Lee could have.<br /><br />It is also interesting to note that David Carradine played the lead in an Oscar winning film biography of Woody Guthrie just after the \\"Kung Fu\\" series ended.

B0000AGWJ7|4.0|I heard the song \\"Unholy Confessions\\" on a sampler and I thought \\"holy crap...I have to get this CD!\\" So I set out to get it, but of course other CDs got in the way of my buying it, so now, about 5 months later, I finally have it.  <br /> <br />So when I first got it I listened to \\"Unholy Confessions\\" again a few hundred times, then I moved on to the next track, \\"Chapter Four\\". By this point I had decided that these guys kick ass. But as I kept listening, I just got a tad bored with the music. I mean, I love complex music, but these guys just got boring to me after a while. It seemed like they dragged everything on just for the sake of having a long song (just about every song on this CD is over 5 minutes and 30 seconds). <br /> <br />I kept listening to the album, however, and eventually read the lyrics along with it, which always helps me get into the band better. I'm happy to say the album grew on me, and as of late I've been listening to it quite a bit. <br /> <br />The vocalist on this album is absolutely astounding. This guy can sing! Just listen to the buildup at the end of track 5 and you'll know that this guy's no amateur. He's got a good scream on him too, but I read in a magazine that it won't be present on their upcoming new album at all because he busted a blood clot in his throat or something of the sort and if he continued to scream like on this album, he wouldn't be able to sing at all in a few years. I believe it was Revolver I read this in. Anyway, on this album his voice, screaming and singing, is amazing. One of the best metal vocalists I've heard in a while. <br /> <br />The guitars and bass on this are great as well. Complex riffs, melodic riffs, heavy riffs-it's all here. Just listen to the riff on the break after the fast intro part on \\"Eternal Sleep\\" and you'll find it hard to resist bobbing your head alone. <br /> <br />The drums are good, no real complaints. A bit of double bass, but not too much, which is good. There are better drummers in metal, but this guy can still keep a beat and stay in step with the rest of the band, so it's not like he brings the band down really at all. <br /> <br />The songs on this album are long and complex. They don't follow the intro-verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus-end that many bands abide by. Instead, you'll get an intro-verse-pre-chorus-chorus-breakdown-altered intro riff, etc., so you never really know where it's going next, which makes the music even more exciting. I personally don't know how they can remember all their parts, but I guess that just shows further that these guys know what they're doing. <br /> <br />I recommend you check out this album if you like metal or hardcore music, but metal in particular. I've seen a lot of people call this band hardcore, but if I had to classify them myself, I'd say they're just straight up metal. Anyway, this is definitely a work done by some accomplished musicians, so I do suggest you check it out.
156224003X|5.0|I give this book and cd my highest of recommendations to all musicians who are looking for more depth, enjoyment, confidence, ease of playing, and well, mastery in their musical careers.  It has brought all of these things to me (and more) at a time when I most needed them.   <br /> <br />It's so easy - as most of us know - to let that little voice in our head tyrannize and corrupt our musical experiences; whether it's during performance, recording, composing, practicing, or even when teaching and listening.  This little voice, and the mindset to which it can lead, can transform what should be an ecstatic and fulfilling musical experience to one of trepidation, discomfort, and even fear. <br />   <br />But if this sounds all too familiar, fret not!  Kenny has laid out a clear and simple plan for us to follow with which we can end all of the anxiety and learn to play music from what is known as \\"the space.\\"  This is the mindset (demonstrated by such legends as Miles Davis, Count Basie, and Itzhak Perlman) of total relaxation and focus that is free of judgment, expectation, and essentially any thought process whatsoever - opening us up like an empty vessel to receive a never-ending supply of ideas and inspiration.  You could also refer to \\"the space\\" as the meditative state brought to a particular task - in this case, playing a musical instrument. It is that place that exists just behind our mind (and all of its ceaseless 'noise') where perfection and joy is a constant. <br /> <br />It is from this space that we must learn to practice and perform music for us to truly achieve what Kenny calls 'effortless mastery,' which he describes as one being able to play the material perfectly (whether it's jazz, classical, etc.) every time and without thought; to the point where the music plays itself and we just stay out of the way. Once we reach this point, he explains, we can experience the bliss, depth of sound, perfection, and everything else we think that only the elite feware 'entitled' to experience.  Effortless mastery is, in fact, available to all of us if only we will open ourselves up to it.  Kenny Werner will show you the way with this beautiful book and cd package.  <br /> <br />Best wishes--     <br />
B00005JMEW|4.0|Quentin Tarantino's ode to martial arts films is for true martial arts fans. He kept it very close to the movies of the 70s, those that came out after the untimely death of Bruce Lee. At least that's as far back as I can remember. He even had the music and coming attractions themes of that era.<br /><br />The one problem I had with the film was the spraying blood scenes. While it was probably done in keeping with the traditional martial arts films he was portraying, I think he should have left that relic out.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters, even those with minor roles like the master sword maker, played by the legendary Sonny Chiba. It would have been nice to see him wield a sword instead only making them.<br /><br />Uma Thurman was okay as a martial artist, but I have to wonder if they took the proper amount of time training her for the action. Or perhaps it was the fight scene choreographer. I don't know but it could have been better. It could have been and should have been spectacular as a matter of fact, but sadly it wasn't.<br /><br />To get a better idea of what I mean, view the 2nd Matrix picture and watch Keanu Reeves' work as a martial artist. Upon viewing his fluidity, his timing, and his flexibility, one can only imagine the work he put in to be so authentic on screen. Much of the credit goes to the fight choreographer who came up with the sequences in the first place.<br /><br />To be fair to women, take a look at Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and see how well the women perform the art in that picture. My point is this: If Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang were able to do it well, there's no reason why Uma couldn't have done equally as well. Perhaps they had a very tight shooting schedule. I don't know, but to me, why bother with the fight sequences if it wasn't going to look great on screen?<br /><br />Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the film. But, I love Tarantino's films so I may be a bit biased in this review.
B00001IVOR|5.0|A lot of crews have copied their style, some even tried to reign as many emcees as they have.  The release of this cd was the height of the Wu and proved a lot of people wrong.  \\"Triumph featuring CappaDonna,\\" proved it by all with the exception of Ol' Dirty.  RZA provided the canvas for them to paint the vivid lyrics on.  Unselfishly each took swings as the rest swarmed around their victims.  There are too many songs I love on this album.  Even the track produced by member Inspectah Deck fitted well in the Chambers they welcomed us to.  Some of the stronger songs had Ghostface Killah and Raekwon switch hit.  Now in 2005 they need to forget the solo albums and finish off the 36 Chambers.  RZA, GZA, U-God, Masta Killa, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah and Inspectah Deck sending rappers back to the drawing table.  RIP Ol' Dirty Bastard.
0767803434|5.0|Andrew W. Marlowe, the writer of Air Force One, did an excellent job of producing a wildly entertaining story of a United States president (Harrison Ford), who basically becomes a counter-terrorism agent when his plane is high jacked in the wild blue yonder.<br /><br />While the taking of Air Force One has to be far more difficult than portrayed on screen, don't worry about it. Sit back and enjoyed the ride and what a ride it is!<br /><br />Gary Oldman, master of a thousand accents, convincingly plays a ruthlessly brutal Russian Terrorist who wants one of his comrades released from prison. Only the president can call in favors to get this done.<br /><br />The conflict: The United States doesn't negotiate with terrorists under any circumstances. Well, maybe the US will negotiate if the president and his family have been kidnapped and used as the only viable bargaining chips.<br /><br />I don't know what kind of shielding the real Air Force One has, but, I for one was glad that there was serious gun play on the 747 without losing cabin pressure and crashing it. Without this feature, the film would have been much less exciting.<br /><br />Let's give writer credit for having the gumption to go with his vision, rather than comprising a good storyline. Hopefully he'll produce more work that captures our attention for another two hours.
B000002TP7|4.0|One of them very cool bands that came out of the woodworks in the mid-'80's that seemed to draw a wider audience with each passing year. This CD sounds like the ultimate cheese album if I've ever heard one. In this case, that a good thing. Thought the disc's single \\"Sabotage\\" was pretty happening as well as the scratch groovin' \\"Sureshot\\", \\"Tough Guy\\" and \\"Alright Hear This\\". Total of twenty tunes here. Not every track rocks, but certainly ENOUGH of them do. Nice alternative / rap punk effort.

I wanted to see a disaster flick and that's exactly what I got.<br /><br />So I give The Day After Tomorrow five stars for effects! Pick it up and know what you're getting.
B0000019PA|5.0|I would definately give it 15 stars, just so it would make up for the clueless Mackey dude's review.  Dear Mackey, ever heard of lo-fi? Apparently not, it is when a band uses production values of a lesser quality because that is how they want it to sound.  And NMH got it perfect on this record, absolutely perfect.  To put the Decemberists within the same vein of music is understandable, but unfair to Colin Meloy, he is no Jeff Mangum, sorry.  They music here is art, insturments that no one uses (who uses a singing saw?) are used to perfection and make tha aural splendor that is In the Aeroplane Over the Sea.  This album is one that gives me goosebumps pretty much everytime I hear it.  I acutally have bought this record 3 times, thanks to some jerkwad friends who lost it twice, I cannot go more that a week without hearing the brilliance that is Neutral Milk Hotel, and neither will you once you hear it and embrace it.
B00004YX39|2.0|This is the worst Steely Dan Album. Period. <br />Babylon Sisters is a great opener, but the rest of the album can be heard playing on elevators everywhere.... <br />Overly polished and stale sounding overall.  <br />Don't Bother.
B00003CWPL|1.0|I saw this film while in college.  Some group sponsored it and charged $1 admission. How could you go wrong for a buck? When the lights came back on I not only wanted my dollar back, I wanted the two hours of my life back. What a pretentious, self-indulgent pile of crap!<br /><br />As we filed out of the lecture hall I overheard someone say that it was \\"brilliant\\". I don't think this guy knew what the hell he just sat through and, figuring if he didn't understand it, it must be genius. I wanted to punch him in the face.
B000005JA8|5.0|No, this is not weirdo hippy trippy music. There is a lot of sense in this record. Most of the music is straight blues, but twisted around the Beefheart way. <br /> <br />Beefheart and Zappa were highschool friends. They played in their first bands together, where Don Vliet first got the name Captain Beefheart. That is about the only thing their music has in common. <br /> <br />If you have a chance, see the documentary with Drumbo, John French. He tells about how Beefheart locked up the band in a house for 6 months. Only one band-member per day was allowed out of the house to do shopping. And he rehearsed them to pieces. Then he went with the band to the studio and recorded the album as if it was all made in one take. <br /> <br />Beefheart's career can be divided in periods. Troutmask Replica is *the* milestone of the early period in the sixties with stomping, raw music. Then comes the softer, sweeter period in the seventies which I find not very interesting. In the early eighties he is back with extremely tight, uncompromising music. And from then on he only paints. Rumour has it he is ill. <br /> <br />Does this help you understand why you should listen to this music? I doubt it. But if I were you, I bought two copies of this disc. One for yourself, and one to give away to a friend whom you would like to get to know this music better.
B000003CMB|5.0|All that needs to be said is that this is the finest live album ever recorded. It may also be the the perfect record. Period.  <br /> <br />People may prefer different styles of music. But no live record I've ever heard in any genre can match this one for its across the board excellence. It is dazzling in all aspects: from the spirit-lifting playing to the wrenching vocals to the sterling production. <br /> <br />For this set of shows, God was smiling on the Brothers. <br />Thank heaven they were rolling tape.  <br />
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Besides Baby Geniuses, this was the worst movie ever. I can't believe I wasted my money on this piece. It had such potential, with all of the old movie monsters available to them and they ruined it with bad cgi, bad dialog, bad script, bad acting and bad directing. So dissapointed in this movie.
078681859X|5.0|If you're looking at this book and thinking to yourself ,\\"Great... another book about a child misplaced, angsty, child magician.\\", then I urge you to reconsider.<br /><br />I read through this book fairly quickly (5 days).  It is no cut-and-paste story.  The characters, plot, and writing style are just about the most original and captivating I've ever read in a children's/young adult novel.<br /><br />The setting is quite interesting.  We aren't really told what year it is or anything, but it's pretty clear that it is a modern setting.  I'm pretty sure it's actually present-day, but kind of an \\"alternate\\" present-day if you will.  This isn't like the world of Harry Potter, in which the Wizards live seperately and secretly apart from the world of the Muggles.  Instead we have Magicians, and believe me they aren't nearly as admirable as the Wizards in the Harry Potter world.  Instead we basically have ambitious, greedy politicians.  Imagine Karl Rove in a cape.<br /><br />Rather than working from their own inherent powers or abilities, magicianship in the world of this book is rather like a profession.  The child magicians, of which the main character (Nathaniel) is one, are in fact called Apprentices.  They are sold by their parents and given a \\"master\\" to study under.  These magicians learn to summon djinn from \\"The Other Place\\" to do their bidding, and derive nearly all their power from these beings, whom they have the ability to bond to their service.  The interesting thing is, djinn is not a made-up concenpt in this book.  The djinn are actually a part of Islamic/Arabic folklore and I've read are even mentioned in the Koran.<br /><br />The kind of rule the magicians exert over the \\"commoners\\" is actually bordering on Orwellian.  In fact, throughout the book I was waiting for one of them to refer to the commoners as \\"proles\\".  The magicians have created the impression that they are the ones keeping the \\"empire\\" safe, and that without them, it would crumble into chaos and death.<br /><br />The two main characters are Nathaniel (human child) and Bartimaeus (a millenia old djinni).  The story shifts between a third-person narrative and a first-person narrative (from Bartimaeus' view).  The \\"Bartimaeus\\" chapters are particularly amusing to read.  Bartimaeus has a very witty, but dark, sense of humor.  He often muses in footnotes about things he's done in the distant past, and about his contempt for magicians.<br /><br />The actual plot of the novel is very well thought out and surprising, but I felt the core motivation of Nathaniel's actions was a bit weak.  Basically, he is humiliated in his home by a particularly loathsome, snotty little magician.  He then hatches a plan to summon a powerful djinni (Bartimaeus) to aid him in his revenge against this magician by stealing a powerful artifact.  The plot thickens nicely as Nathaniel realizes just HOW powerful the stolen artifact in fact is, but I felt the initial motivation for his actions made Nathaniel seem too petty.  But then maybe that was the intention as Nathaniel does seem a bit too concerned with \\"worldly\\" things.<br /><br />Overall, a fast-paced read (but not so fast your head will spin).  If you're wanting a refreshingly original fantasy story, I'd recommend this book.  It is interesting to note that I haven't heart much hub-bub over the content of this book.  It's got some violence, but isn't overtly gory or gruesome.  What I mean is, there is specific (and frequent) mention of pentacles and other such imagery (demons, etc) that could offend some in the religious right or what have you.  I just kept thinking to myself while reading \\"Man, if people were cheesed off by Harry Potter, why aren't they angry over this book?\\"into chaos and death. <br /> <br />The two main characters are Nathaniel (human child) and Bartimaeus (a millenia old djinni).

B00005JNBQ|2.0|If you have read the hype and breathless reviews before seeing this movie, you will be disappointed.  <br /> <br />It's just not that great, nor is it that interesting. The bandwagon jumping is more amusing to watch than this movie is.
B000000OQF|5.0|This CD led the masses in my part of the world (So Cali) out of the degenerating rap music scene and inspired legions of kids to pick up a guitar and play. Far too many people try to downplay this band's importance and impact on music by using Axl's behavoir and the rest of the band's drug abuse to judge them. <br /> <br />This CD holds it's own as one of the best albums ever recorded, the band is amazing, the riffs are unforgettable, Axl as a vocalist is an enigma. I think this album is #61 on Rolling Stone's list of best ever albums. I think it speaks volumes about this band and Axl himself that Velvet Revolver is doing very well and even 10 + years later there are still heavily trafficed fan sites chattering with rumors of \\"Chinese Democracy\\". <br /> <br />If you like loud, hard, rock and roll with a taste of the filth and excess the Hollywood music scene relished in at the time, you'll love this CD. I've owned it since it came out and I have all but Rocket Queen loaded in an Ipod that I use daily. The tracks that didn't make it big on the radio or MTV are actually my favorites. It's so (f'n) easy, Nightrain, Out ta get me, You're (f'n) crazy.  <br /> <br />
B00065MDRW|5.0|Having both the 30th anniversary edition and this now the original master I do notice a slight clarity and increased volume of sound over the 3oth that completists like this listener spends money on...they are both great ,the booklet is 12 pages like the 30th,  news clippings and all yet the greatness of Crimson is that there is always so much going on in their music...all of their lineups were/are great and different...their cult following is truly a cult and their experiments in most genres of music are always unique never selling their fans short...I always get the impression that Robert Fripp does what he wants because he likes what he does and does not give 2 hoots about what the world thinks..This cd can not be explained in adjectives..you just have to get it if you dig Prog rock and it remains one the main pillars of 20th century music.Discipline means to learn not to follow.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|This is a much better introduction to the Pixies than the previous \\"Death To The...\\" compilation.  I am not big on best of's, but this has pretty much all the \\"hits\\".  My only question is why include two b-sides, when they just released a b-sides collection where people can obtain these songs if they want them.  I usually don't quibble over song selections on hits cds, but \\"Cecilia Ann\\" and \\"Head On\\" would have been much better, and much more obvious choices!  Anyway, if you're just getting you're feet wet, this is a good place to start, to see if you are up for the challenge that is PIXIES!
B00005NTJK|5.0|Listening to Benefit again yesterday with the better sound and extra tracks showed me how great Tull were...there is a folk delicacy and blues rock urgency found in their music capturing the spirit of their day...the psychological tension is relieved by the sweetness...I am a completist and dig this early period of Tull the best..the lyrics and feel are emotional never distant..all of their albums are fine art but for this listener their first 4 album's stand up the best...can not knock the intensity of Thick As A Brick onward but someone like me that also digs the Soft Machine,King Crimson,Traffic, Tull is and will always be on the short Prog Rock list with a uniqueness truly their own.
0312995423|2.0|At the beginning of this book, Brown thanks a couple anonymous ex-NSA agents for their assistance with its creation.  Since the NSA (National Security Agency) is a covert gov't organization for which very little public information exists, it's impossible to tell where their contribution ends and Brown's imagination begins.  In the interest of national security, I sincerely hope their contribution was largely replaced by Brown's imagination.  There are so many problems with this book I hardly know where to begin. <br /> <br />The basic plot is that a disgruntled ex-NSA agent has developed a method of cryptography that the NSA's $2B electronic eavesdropping supercomputer will be unable to break, and is offering this information technology to the highest bidder in the name of personal privacy rights. <br /> <br />Dangling pieces of the puzzle before the reader, Brown challenges them to attempt to solve mysteries which baffle the \\"best cryptographic minds of their time\\".  This is part of the problem; if these problems were too challenging for them, why did I have such an easy time solving them?!  You don't need to be a world-class mathematician or trained in cryptography to see through these puzzles; they're more like attempting the Jumble in the newspaper than the problems in the back of the average Scientific American.  The glaringly obvious solutions will be apparent to most adult readers the moment he mentions them.  This might make the problem-solving accessible to the greatest number of readers, but it undermines the competency he's attempting to create for his \\"brilliant\\" protagonists. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the computer hardware and data safeguards Brown sets in place to protect the NSA's comprehensive federal-agency-spanning database of classified information (and the aforementioned $2B, 3 million processor supercomputer) are so woefully inadequate as to be laughable.  His villains make such obvious mistakes as to make them laughable.  Furthermore, the ex-NSA agent was supposedly selling his new crypto technology to the highest bidder, but Brown only introduces one firm in the bidding competition and only slightly ties this in to the rest of the story.  He would definitely have created a better book by exploring this branch of the story further. <br /> <br />The very end of the book was even more disappointing. Brown chose to make a belated, half-hearted attempt at tying in the head of this firm with the technology's creator.  After reading The Da Vinci Code, I expected a gripping page-turner, but I never experienced a moment of tension or suspense while reading this book. It was more like watching a lackluster made-for-TV movie-of-the-week. <br /> <br />Having said all this, I was curious enough about what was going to happen next, and sufficiently entertained, to finish this short book (which took somewhere in the ballpark of 6 or 7 hours). Obviously not his best work, but no one hits a home run every at bat.
0679809015|5.0|This is one of my Son's favorite book.  It is all tattered now, but still he loves going through it and lifting the flaps.  I mad it a point of making the appropriate and animated animal noises when he opens each flap.  It's great fun!
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|what happened? \\"Devil's Night\\" was so good! and this is just plain wack n disappointing, eminem has just had his worst year of music.. this album sux along with \\"Encore\\". i luv em but he just doesnt do it like he used 2 anymore. <br />okay back to \\"D12 World\\" now, it isnt a good listen, it was hard 2 try like a few songs but i do not mind a couple....\\"My Band\\" i used 2 luv when it came out but it was way overplayed! but since i did like it, i dont mind it...\\"Git Up\\" is okai. and i like \\"40 Oz\\". i dont recommend this to any1, this is just my opinion u can go listen 2 sum1 else but i DONT recommend this 2 anyone!
0689835604|4.0|This book along with other Karen Katz' books are great books for little kids.  My Son loves these books, they were among the first books I got for him.  But these books are not sturdy enough for him now that he is 2.  He loved lifting the flaps so much, now they are all torn out.  But still, they were great fun for him!
B000002UAF|5.0|This is not only the soundtrack to the Beatles [[ASIN:B0000542D2 first movie]], but it's also the first and only Beatles album to feature all Lennon/McCartney songs.  Yes, all the Beatles albums after [[ASIN:B0025KVLT2 Rubber Soul]] featured all original songs, but every one of those albums had at least one song written by George Harrison.  Anyway, this is another great album by the Beatles.  One of the somewhat surprising things about this album is how dominant John Lennon is on it.  He sings lead on nine of the 13 songs, with Paul singing three leads, George singing one lead and Ringo not singing at all.  This is the first of three albums not to feature Ringo singing, all of which were soundtracks.  Well, you probably already know most of the songs on this album, so why should I go on and on about how great they are?  Just buy it, already!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|any one who says Nightwish are not metal or are for young kids are talking rubbish.I am 36 been into metal since 1980 have over 4000 metal albums ,have been to countless gigs and love Nightwish.It is great to see a young band trying something different.Once is flawless and that does not happen often.Also a great live band ,seen them a few times in Europe and they draw a crowd from 6-60 from from all musical backgrounds.
B000777J2S|1.0|If you think you'd enjoy the sound of a voice reminiscient of a cross between a sheep and a deeper-voiced Cher, than this album is for you.
B000067IZ3|4.0|Character, decision-making, love, honor, deceit, trust....all are put into question in Traffic, a powerful and moving film.....to go along with the many beautiful and honest teachings of this movie, the structure of the film is captivating as well, with inter-related stories being told simultaneously....the performances are strong, the directing and storyline even stronger...traffic is an honorable mention in my book...it is worth seeing
B00005JNBQ|5.0|-Napoleon and impersonations of said character have become teenage (for the most part) phenomenons...technicals/production errors (for which this film has been bashed, along with its plot, or lackthereof) must be overlooked in a classic comedy filled with memorable characters, quotes, and clips....aren't these aspects what make a great comedy?? <br />*for its national impact as well as its top-notch humor, Napoleon Dynamite must be given a sincere chance
B0006Z2LH4|1.0|Talentless direction, amatuerish turgid acting, an insipid incondite script that will make your brain bleed, cheap thrills and special effects worthy of Sci Fi channel garbage. There are no surprises and not a second of suspense or anything of any redeeming value to recommend this. Watch the brilliant nightmarish original 'CUBE' and avoid this big Zero at all costs.
B0006J28KU|2.0|As Mr. Davidson mentioned above, my two stars aren't for the movie which is great, but for Warner Brothers \\"cheap\\" presentation for this movie.  No \\"high definition\\" transfer, no DTS soundtrack.  I'm suprised because Michael Mann has generally stated that he really cares about his movies in the DVD format.<br /><br />The gun battle in this movie is one of the all-time best in movie history and Warner Brothers couldn't do it justice.<br /><br />Do not buy this DVD and waste your money.  Maybe one day, somebody at Warner Home Video will care about the consumer and put out a quality product.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Too many sh**ty movies came out in 2004. Shrek 2, Dodgeball, The Bourne Supremacy...the list goes on and on. the geniuses of the now watered-down South Park have created the number one movie in America...involving puppets!<br /><br />If you want to get something for your kids to watch or to play at a youth group movie night, toss out your Shrek and other G and PG rated movies. Play this! It is approved by Christians worldwide, and it has no ounce of profanity in it.<br /><br />Why is it rated R? It is rated R for \\"really enjoyable for all\\". I can't wait until it comes out in theatres!
B000255LNE|5.0|This album shines beautifully with great songs...both discs are great but the second disc is a masterpiece...every track and i mean everyone is superb....excellent mastering provides audiophile sound quality...price range from $11.00 for good quality \\"Like NEW\\" cd..grab it now.
B000002LEE|5.0|Nothing's Shocking is brilliant.  I am 29 and grew up listenting to Janes Addiction.  And while I realize many of my opinions durning youth may be questionable, this is a CD I will continue to love.  I sincerely wish to thank the band for such great music. <br /> <br />Timmus
B00005JLEU|5.0|-- by some of the best story-telling in animation today.<br /><br />The basic plot is familiar, especially to Miyazaki fans. A plucky young girl, thrown into strange circumstances, wins her goals through hard work and bravery. In this case, little Chohiro is thrown into a Japanese fantasy world, working as a bath-house drudge, in order to save her enchanted parents.<br /><br />The bath-house, however, serves the spirits, gods, and other beings that apparently inhabit Japan's fairy tales. Remember in Shrek, how seemingly every one of the Brothers Grimm characters came to life, all together? It's like that, but with a serious tone. The difference is that I didn't recognize any of the characters. They're not the fairy tales I grew up with. I could see that they were cultural icons, but not from my culture. That fascinated me - now I want to go and find out just who all those characters were, and what cultural meaning they have.<br /><br />It's kid-safe, with no serious adult themes or violence. Those aren't needed to keep Chohiro's quest interesting and to sustain a sense of wonder. There's enough to keep an adult interested, too. Don't wait til there's a kid around to treat yourself to this incredible movie.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000003Z12|5.0|Neal Schon's solo effort, Beyond the Thunder, is, simply put, great.  His work is clean, nifty, passionate, exuberant, dynamic and elegant.  The music on this CD fits perfectly into the light jazz section of your collection.  Schon's solos on this all-instrumental album are controlled and expertly phrased.  Each theme is developed and heightened.  Most of the many skills of this terrific guitarist are highlighted.  The music here is definitely more sophisticated than most of what we've heard from Schon's work at Journey, yet on more than one song a tidbit, a phrase, filters into the mix from some of his 1980's Journey riffs.  The vast majority of the music is definitely Schon but is new to the ear.  He plays with tremendous control and articulation.  Jonathan Cain accompanies on keyboards.  Standout songs after a couple of go rounds are Big Moon, Send Me An Angel, and Carribean Blue.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|Thanks to the reviewer who let me know, \\"The reason for huge numbers of five star reviews is because the die-hard fans have started a campaign to overwhelm the more realistic reviews of this show\\".  I watched two episodes and promptly removed this DVD from my wish list (only there because of the 5 star 'average').  It really is the most tedious, ill concieved, badly scripted and appalling piece of TV trash.
0767834739|5.0|This film, as almost everyone in the world knows, is based upon a very popular video game series and is the best adaptation ever, albeit not the closest.  The adaptation closest to its source material would be House of the Dead, as much as you hate to see it written it is.  I love House of the Dead by the way.   <br /> <br />Now, to the movie.  This movie is excellent.  This movie has more dogs, lickers, zombies, and the inclusion of the Nemesis, considered to be the best Resident Evil monster.  I think those honors go to the lickers, my favorite.  This film doesn't add anything new or innovative to the zombie world, but what film in the past ten years has?  Zombies are flat creatures.  The reason Resident Evil is so cool is that there are more than just zombies included.  Sharks, lickers, hunters, dogs, and tyrants!  This movie is worth the price I payed when it first came out.  I was totally captivated by the action.  The film jumped me at times, and I was totally creeped out in the school scene.  Mike Epps is definitely worth the price of this DVD.  He doesn't try to be a serious character, completely revamping his career, but he sticks to his normal self, LAUGHS, LAUGHS, LAUGHS!  I'll admit that I laughed at EVERY one of his lines.  Just because it isn't the scariet film ever doesn't mean that you shouldn't view it, ignore the bad, horrible reviews and see it.  You owe it to yourself.  Give the filmmakers a chance to make a third.  Other great zombie movies are 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead (2004), Shaun of the Dead, Resident Evil, Romero's holy trilogy, and anything by Lucio Fulci involving zombies.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|The first time I watched this movie I didn't like it.  I have seen it a couple more times now; I think it is going to become a cult classic.  Genuis is the best way to describe the writing and directing in this film.  Simple and funny are two words that describe the story.  But there are a few more words that can be included: daring, brilliant, and creative.<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite creators, Jared Hess and his wife, manage to offer a story touching on so many real-life high school and rural living situations that hit close-to-home for most people.  Some my find the situations almost too close to home.  I found the entire film to be enjoyable entertainment.<br /><br />Napoleon is definitley a nerd.  But he is a nerd searching for a way to make his life a little better; he is trying to stand up to his \\"looney\\" grandmother (at least I think that's who she was), deal with his strangely-geekier-than-Napoleon-himself brother Kip, and fight off the bullies who attack him day after day.  He makes friends with another loner named Pedro, a guy who appears addicted to downers, thought I don't think that's included in the storyline.<br /><br />Napoleon's uncle Rico ends up coming to visit, and this adds more difficult times for poor Napoleon.  I think each of these characters, including Pedro's and Napoleon's love interests in the movie, interact so well together that the story almost seems like it is a documentary - a bit of an exaggerated documentary though.<br /><br />It is really cool to watch Napoleon deal with so many situations, which aren't really earth-shattering events, but he treats them as they are.  He handles problems Napoleon's way, and that gives this film a unique freshness that grows on the viewer.<br /><br />This is a movie that has to be watched more than once to completely grasp its creative juices.  I think John Heder plays this role so well that it may be hard for him to ever be himself again.  Many people will always call him Napoleon from now on.  I would love to see a part two and part three.  Heck, what about a weekly television show!  Napoleon may be one of the most memorable characters to come out of a film since Silence of the Lambs' \\"Hannibel the Cannibal\\".<br /><br />Like I said earlier, I didn't \\"get\\" this film upon a first look, but after another viewing I really think this independent film is going to LAUNCH the career of Jared Hess to a new level.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Napoleon Dynamite, I suggest you give it a try.  If the first time you watch it, it seems a little \\"off\\", give it one more try.  I think it such a different kind of movie that it is hard to \\"take it all in\\" upon the first viewing.<br /><br />I am glad to have this little gem on my DVD shelf.<br /><br />See ya next review.poleon from now on.

B0006399FS|5.0|I haven't read any other reviews before writing this, so as not to be influenced by them one way or the other, so I'm sorry if this doesn't settle any pros or cons below. <br />Pros- <br />very artistic in a spare, raw sort of way, back to the roots of pop/rock and their 80's sounds, some nice images, very good interpretations of lyrics, great bass work, and lead guitar invention, nice to hear less mixing than on most polished singles these days. It feels as though it is an experimental album from a band who has done just about everything and are finally playing around and trying the ideas they've had for years but were never able to do earlier. It's also nice to hear that bono sing sweetly tonally and emotionally as a younger artist would, but also struggle abit on some of the more vocally demanding songs. <br />Cons- it is at first not an easy album for non musicians (not just people who call themselves such)to listen to, after the extremely poetic and commercial (although catchy and grammy winning) last album, I wasn't sure what to expect. It took a few listens for me to appreciate the stripped down sound and the knowing uses of cliches throughout. I can't say that many of the songs will become classics. However, blinding lights, all because of you and love and peace or else have serious potential. <br />I think it's an album that doesn't try to make you like it or identify with it's emotions.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Without getting too in depth....'Requiem For a Dream' is the story of Harry (Leto), his mother Sara (Burstyn), his homeboy Tyrone (Wayans), and his girlfriend Marion (Connely).  Each one with hopes and dreams of the good life.  A dream of eternal happiness.  Each one quickly begins to take a big plunge downhill toward utter despair and lonliness.  Finally, they each reach their breaking point and find themselves in the most awful of situations..... <br /> <br />'Requiem' is powerful, stunning, gut-wrenching, and downright heart-breaking.  It is brilliantly revealing and gritty.  Holding nothing back, and giving no leeway to the squeemish.  Ellen Burstyn is spectacular, but Leto is the one who really lights up the screen like few have ever done.   <br /> <br />This film is permanantly branded in my brain.  After I saw it for the first time, I was literally numb.  My body felt empty and ailing.  The films effects are almost hypnotic and are gauranteed to leave you nothing short of stunned.  It will literally take your breath away, and might just make you a bit sick.  It is a film the no one who watches it can possibly forget.  If I ever see a more powerful film than 'Requiem' so long as I live, I will truly be shocked.
B0000DKKY4|4.0|This is a first class compiliation of Cat Stevens' greatest hits. If you are a baby boomer, then you will greatly appreciate this album which primarily features music from the late sixties and the seventies. Some of the music will put you on the nostalgia train and some of it is timeless, but all of it is excellent.<br /><br />Cat Stevens is undoubtedly a prolific songwriter and when he sings his music, you get gold. This anthology of his music is about as good as it gets. From \\"Lady D'arbanville\\" to \\"Wild World\\", \\"Moonshadow\\", \\"Peace Train\\", \\"Oh Very Young\\", and, of course, \\"Morning Has Broken\\", the listener can't go wrong. Cat Stevens' talent is such that not only can he write great music, but he can sing, as well. His voice is at times folksy, at other times rich and vibrant, with a catch in it that can break your heart. When Cat Stevens converted to Islam and left the entertainment world, Islam's gain was truly the music world's loss.<br /><br />It is the domestic version of this CD, however, released under the same name, which is the better value price wise, and the one worth having in one's personal music collection, notwithstanding the fact that this import does have an extra four tracks. At nearly double the price of the domestic version, this import is not worth that extra money, especially as the domestic version has all the tracks worth having.
B00005NGZX|5.0|First off, I'd like to address the [faulty] criticism that reviewers shunned this album as 'amelodic' which is of course completely asinine unless by 'melody' you mean clean singing because you sure won't find that here. Converge are certainly not as abrasively noisy and atonal as their peers Botch or DEP. That's not to say that Jane Doe is a 'safe' album though, far from it. The chaos still rules with a metal fist and while the band is as tight and uncompromising as ever their songcraft has improved a few notches since \\"Petitioning...\\" resulting in more epic arrangements, clever transitions and pointed intensity to create a modern metal/HC classic. <br /> <br />best tracks: Homewrecker, Heaven In Her Arms, Jane Doe

0060594888|5.0|If you are new to self-development books, this will blow your socks off! An absolutely incredible quantity and quality of self-improvement strategies are packed into this powerful inspirational book. This is one of those books that you can dip into over and over again for a quick mental or emotional boost. Just about every page contains an immediately applicable suggestion or strategy for changing your life for the better. Countless examples of famous and successful people who have used these principles are featured. There's also some great cartoons!<br /><br />On the other hand, if you have been exploring and attempting to live these kind of ideas through authors such as Anthony Robbins and Wayne Dyer for a few years, there may not be much new here for you. In fairness, Canfield does acknowledge the influence of such writers throughout this excellent book. He has combined the best of many previous (mainly American) self-development, success, and spiritual writers with original material to come up with a fresh contemporary package.<br /><br />Some may find this book a bit materialistic and a bit \\"me me me\\" in places. Personally, many of the ideas here have helped me in every area of my life, including my work as a nurse and musician, neither of which are chiefly concerned with accumulating massive material wealth.<br /><br />Grab hold of the stuff you can relate to, give it a try, and keep working at it! A brilliant book. Thanks Jack.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Although Clive Owen was miscast as King Arthur, he does extremely well here as a consultant dermatalogist, living up to the part and coming across convincingly. The online chatroom sequence (between himself and Jude Law) is pretty dramatic when watched through DVD on a screen at home (just like a 'puter, eh?) and draws the viewer down to the plot's deeper and seedier level. Portman and Roberts are also good--Roberts the best I've seen her for years. The use of music (a lot of Opera) is affective, suitably matching the characters' roles and various mood swings. All-in-all, this is one of the few DVDs that are really worth owning. The complexity of the relationships involved is what you will keep coming back to.
B000093BDX|4.0|A good set with lots of great songs, but The Beach Boys have enough classics to easily fill two discs, a la FORTY LICKS. Among the missing: \\"409\\", \\"Wendy\\",\\"Catch A Wave\\", \\"Little Honda\\",\\"The Little Girl I Once Knew\\", \\"Caroline No\\", \\"Cabinessence\\", \\"Surf's Up\\", \\"Sail On Sailor\\", and something by Dennis and Carl - perhaps \\"River Song\\" and \\"Feel Flows\\", respectively.  <br /> <br />  Still, if you don't have any Beach Boy albums, this is a good start. Then try the SUNFLOWER/SURF'S UP disc before it goes out of print.
B0002S947K|5.0|Ray Lamontagne, a new name in the market, and an image of a great singer/songwriter is what we have here.  A true find, a voice like no others. He has been compared to Otis Redding, Van Morrison and David Grey, However, Ray has a voice of his own, sometimes gravelly, always luscious. His first CD \\"Trouble\\" is bound to be a great one. The lyrics alone are enough to bring in accolades, but his voice and the music behind him, guitar, piano, harmonica and bass are all he needs. This is one to be remembered.<br /><br />Ray Lamontagne spent most of his life moving around with his family, but found himself settled in Maine. He says he was an \\"oddball\\", always in trouble and hated school. He and his mom would have fights about his education. He finally made it through high school, just barely. He was working in a shoe mill in a small Maine town, when he woke up one morning to a tune on the radio that resonated in his head. He suddenly realized \\"This is what I am meant to be doing, singing and songwriting\\". He never went back to the mill. He set out to find his true vocation. He was found by the people he needed to meet and made this CD in California. Now Ray Lamontagne is touring all over the world, bringing his voice and music to us. I first saw/heard him on Conan O'Brien singing the title song, \\"Trouble\\". His voice has a mesmerizing quality that resounds with true vitality.<br /><br />Ray writes and sings his own songs. \\"Trouble\\" is my favorite song with \\"All the Wild Horses\\" a close second.  However, each song has a place of its own. Ray Lamontagne has given us a CD that begs to be listened to over and over again. Each time you pick up another sound, another lyric you might have missed before, that puts the pieces of this CD together.<br /><br />A cold winter's night with a fire in the stove, kicking leaves on a frosty autumn day, or sitting in the sunshine on a spring day when the air is fresh and clean are some of the best times to listen to this CD, but, in reality, there isn't a bad time to listen. Love this singer/songwriter, Ray Lamontagne. Whole heartedly recommended. prisrobo listen. Love this singer/songwriter, Ray Lamontagne. Whole heartedly recommended. prisrob
B00006879E|5.0|WOW! I bought this cd when I first heard \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and have been in love with it ever since. Every song is so different--no songs sound alike. You will NEVER get tired of listening to this cd. It's a truly amazing album. Adam Levine is truly gifted--he mesmerizes you with his incredible voice. They're just an awesome group. Songs About Jane is worth every penny.
0345440757|5.0|This book was just fanastic!  I guess I am one of the lucky mums who read this when my infant was only 3 weeks old.  We have managed to get her into a great routine which I can only attribute to following this book to the letter and getting an early start!  People envy how great my baby is, yet she wasnt always that way... this really is a book that every new parent should treat as their bible....
B000002A46|5.0|Technically,this is Mariah Carey's fifth album,released in 1994. Her first four albums were released one a year in the previous four years. ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU is a Top 20 hit which would appear in remix form with Jermaine Dupri and Lil Bow Bow on GREATEST HITS. The other tracks are great.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Al Pacino and Robert Deniro never starred in a movie before this. Well they were in Godfatheer 2 together but shared no scenes together anyway. They chose the right movie to star in together with Heat that's for sure. They both are equelly good here. Pacino plays a cop on the trail of criminals who are great at what they do. Deniro plays the leader of the robbers.  Him and his team do a job that was just supposed to  be steal the money from a armered truck and leave. Deniro's character believes in killing only when you have to. Things go bad though when a new member of his team turns out to be nuts and kills the guards out of cold blood.<br /><br />  This movie has a great script and great director that both give Pacino and Deniro a chance to do some of their best work. It's original and smart. Is one scene where Pacino pulls over Deniro and instead of arresting him. They go get a cup coffee and get to know each other as people. You don't get that much in movies at all. What shortly follows that scene is an awesome robbery scene that's one of the best ever filmed. This film just has it all. Realistic human emotion, a great cast and one of the best endings to a movie I've ever scene. Elliot Goldenthal's great musical score makes the ending even more powerful and beautiful . Why this wasn't nominated for best picture is beyond me.
B000002H70|5.0|Robert Smith and The Cure soared mostly under the radar with eclectic punkish goth pop in the early 80's until this eternal moody gem came out in '89.  There's a reason for all the ballyhoo surrounding this disc, it seems that great artist have this one transcendent epic masterpiece in them, and \\"Disintegration\\" is it for Robert Smith and The Cure.<br /><br />I have recently fished Disintegration from among the boneyard of my audio cassettes and find just like when it was released I can't stop playing it.  The guitar bass drum lines simply roll and repeat a minor soundscape with Smith's melodramatic high wail droning love lost, love forlorn, deep and dark.  It's downright cathartic in its moodiness.  Regardless of the weather while you are listening to Disintegration, you will dredge up beautiful rainy days at a window where the rain and gray skies go on for days.<br /><br />Perhaps the high watermark is in \\"Same Deep Water as You,\\" which is a minor-tinged love song (if you could call it such) with the poetic lyrics perfectly matched by Smith's voice, \\"\\"Kiss me goodbye / Pushing out before I sleep / It's lower now and slower now / The strangest twist upon your lips / But I don't see And I don't feel / But tightly hold up silently /My hands before my fading eyes / And in my eyes Your smile / The very last thing before I go...I will kiss you forever on nights like this.\\"<br /><br />If you haven't heard that song, it's reason enough for getting a hold of a copy of \\"Disintegration.\\"  The rest is more of the same brilliance with a temporary relief from melancholy with \\"Fascination Street.\\"  I really can't say enough good things about this work...one of my all time faves.<br /><br />--MMW
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|\\"Cube Zero\\" is the second sequel to the 1997 Canadian indie horror hit \\"Cube\\".  The concept in Cube was that a group of strangers were trapped in a never-ending maze of cubes, many of them rigged with lethal traps.  They had no idea how they got there, they just knew they desperately needed to get out.  It was a very low-budget affair that worked well due to strong acting, interesting philosophical concepts and an original idea.  The year 2002 saw the release of Cube2:Hypercube, a decent film that nevertheless succumbed to the law of diminishing returns that are sequels.  While entertaining, it offered nothing new and was basically a rehash of the original.<br /><br />\\"Cube Zero\\" finally tries something different, as it gives us a look at the people \\"behind the cube\\", those who push the trap buttons and those who are the brains behind the operation.  We meet a couple of guys whose job it is to monitor the people inside the cube and to push certain buttons when ordered to do so by their superiors, whom they have never met or seen.  Eventually, one of the two guys becomes obsessed with a woman trapped inside and enters the cube himself in an attempt to rescue her.<br /><br />Although still very much a b-movie, there's a decidedly superior production quality, higher budget, and more special effects this time around.  It looks way slicker than any of the previous two cube movies.  That being said, it did lack the charming indie vibe of the original.  What made the original so good were the characters, how each of them had a special strength and the interesting conversations they had.  In this entry aside from the two \\"Cube Workers\\" the characters feel flat and underdeveloped.<br /><br />This \\"Cube\\" finally sheds some light on fundamental questions that were previously unexplained in the other two movies such as who is behind the cube, why the people are inside in the first place, what they did wrong that got them in there, etc.  Every few minutes something interesting is revealed about the origins of the Cube and that is one of the main reasons it kept me on the edge of my seat.  As for the action inside the cube, nothing very original this time, much of the same types of traps and rooms, although the gore scenes were quite creative and very graphic. I must say that I was quite impressed with Cube Zero.  Does it give us all the answers?  No, but it does give us a whole lot, more than any of the previous two entries combined.teresting is revealed about the origins of the Cube and that is one of the main reasons it kept me on the edge of my seat.

B00009W0U4|5.0|***SPOILER ALERT*** <br /> <br />I keep reading reviews stating that the assailant was brutally murdered by Pierre in the revenge scene. If you didn't catch the very last shot of the true rapist, staring bewilderedly at Pierre, then you haven't gotten the full message of the film. The rapist did NOT die at the end of the film (although, I'll admit, the poor sob that lost his face DID look a whole lot like the tenia...). I didn't catch this the first time around, but after I finished it, I went back to that scene and watched closely. He's even wearing the same necklace. My guess is that the tenia was in that back room that those two thugs were standing in front of (guarding?). During all of the commotion, he must have come out to witness the murder, realizing that it was meant for him. That look in the last take of the scene says it all...you can even see a smile creeping into that look of disbelief. Obviously, this makes the overall message far bleaker than if he had truly had his face beaten in (which he most definately deserved). Knowing that the most despised character in the movie is the only one that truly comes out unscathed...THAT is what makes this movie so disturbing. I read reviews saying that the rape and the murder scenes haunt them for days after seeing the film...but seeing that filthy rapist smile, knowing he's getting away with it...that's something i won't be forgetting any time soon. <br /> <br />
0226443221|5.0|The only think I would add to what has been said already is that this book should be strongly considered for courses that emphasize the interaction between medicine and public health.  Unlike other books written about the urban condition, this book focuses on a single public health problem and presents it from both scientific and sociodemographic perspectives.  Medical and public health students alike stand much to gain by reading this book.
0446677450|1.0|This book is the biggest sham I have ever read. It teaches you nothing, except that the author is an extremely egocentric person that enjoys showing off his financial successes (being them true or not, he might be very wealthy after publishing this book about nothing...).  Do not waste your time like I did.  The book is a succession of superficial advices that will probably lead you nowhere.  I read until the last page trying to get something useful, but ultimately the author has nothing to teach you, except that he also has another 20 books, 5 games, 2 different courses that will make HIM richer and richer.
B0007PAMEM|5.0|Its so nice to see new titles coming from the Tina camp. While this dvd gets my 5 stars and will be proudly added to my Tina collection, I will say I am still looking for titles yet to be released on dvd. \\"The Girl From Nutbush\\", \\"Private Dancer Live\\", \\"Break Every Rule (HBO Concert)\\", and a second volume of hit videos collection that hopefully will include the mysteriously ommitted videos for \\"Typical Male\\" and \\"One of the Living\\" not to mention all of the videos released after \\"Simply the Best - Videos\\" collection. I cannot wait to get my copy of \\"All the Best\\" dvd. DJ Gary
B0002B15WE|5.0|die hard is one of the most classic movies ever made. die hard is the movie that started it all. an action-packed thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie. the sequels were good too, but the first one is clearly the best!
B00000JZI9|5.0|Think about it, here you got these four heroes riding along together, Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Kevin Costner and Danny Glover.  All of them develop their characters admirably and a compelling plot emerges as the bad guys, the McKendricks try to prevent the open range being closed up by new settlers.<br /><br />So many of the supporting cast are great as well.  John Cleese with his role as a sheriff, and Brian Dennehy as the former bad guy now a sheriff and in the employ of the McKendricks add an interesting element to the movie.  On top of all this, you get Jeff Goldblum in the mix as a two-faced gambler and there is a great deal of intrique going on.<br /><br />I admit I also like the score to the movie.  Reminiscent of the score for the old TV series \\"How the West Was Won\\", I expected to see Zebulon McCahan show up to save the day.  This movie has alot of universal appeal that critics sometimes miss.  I highly recommend this movie.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|And what POOR company he surrounded himself with here. I gave this a listen and it is dreck from start to finish. It is the most boring, asinine, watered-down, flavorless album I've heard since Norah Jones' \\"Come Away With Me\\". What a shame; the people he duets with are washed-up has-beens (except Willie). What was Ray thinking? Was this album messed with by the sharks / suits at his record label? Was outside \\"help\\" brought in long after Ray's contributions to \\"tweak\\"? This is a HORRIBLE record. I cannot recommend anyone buying this unless you want to fatten the coffers of its record company or if you're a masochist. The Grammys further evade anything resembling credibility by giving THIS \\"Album of the Year\\"! This is music at its worst. Throw this in the garbage, because that's where it belongs. This is a travesty and an injustice to the musical legacy of Ray Charles.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Peter O'Toole is just wonderful as Lawrence in this movie.  Learning to love Arabia and to inspire the arabs to fight against the Turks, all the while Lawrence is being manipulated by his British Superiors who had their own agenda. The musical score is beautiful.  After watching this movie, I normally have the songs in my head for a couple of days.<br /><br />Alec Guiness as Prince Faisal and Omar Shariff as Sherif do an excellent job in their respective roles,  as does Quinn.  The movie is larger than life and despite the length, I love to watch it in the comfort of my own home.
B00005JLSE|4.0|This is a musical in the tradition of musicals that are entertaining and easy to digest, and yet some hours later leave one with some apprehension.  Is it really the intent of the story to celebrate getting away with murder?  Or is this movie a statement about how murder by women in emotionally trying circumstances can be justified?  Or perhaps is this an indictment of the criminal justice system?  Or is this just a spicy entertainment?<br /><br />I'll opt for the latter; however I can tell you that women will find this more agreeable than their spouses.  There is a kind of historically revisionist feeling to the sentiments expressed.  I seriously doubt that this production, in which murder from jealousy is seemingly justified, would have been produced as a musical comedy before the modern era.<br /><br />But never mind.  What makes Bob Fosse's Chicago a hit (and the Academy's Best Picture of 2002) are the beautifully staged and choreographed song and dance numbers, the spiffy direction and neat editing, a lot of leggy flesh along with some fine performances by Queen Latifah, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger.<br /><br />In particular I liked Queen Latifah's performance.  When she comes on singing \\"When You're Good to Momma\\" she just about brings the house down.  I also liked her portrayal of the savvy and corrupt Boss Lady on Murderess Row.  Zeta-Jones got the Oscar for best Supporting Actress, and she was good, but I think Latifah, who was also nominated, was just as impressive if not more so.<br /><br />Zellweger, looking almost anorectic compared to the last time I saw her in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)--released only the year before--gives a solid performance in a very demanding role, although to be honest, it appeared that she was doing a lot of lipsyncing.  Still one is amazed at how good she and Zeta-Jones were at the old song and dance, not having been previous known for being twinkle-toed.<br /><br />You might want to see this to compare how it stands up to a long line of filmland musicals, such as Oklahoma, South Pacific, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Phantom of the Opera, etc.  Chicago certainly is well within the confines of that venerable traditional, although it is my feeling, that despite the Academy's favor, this is just a notch below the best.ls, such as Oklahoma, South Pacific, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Phantom of the Opera, etc.  Chicago certainly is well within the confines of that venerable traditional, although it is my feeling, that despite the Academy's favor, this is just a notch below the best.
0385334206|5.0|Purely and simply the funniest book I have ever read, however be prepared for some pretty extreme racism. But don't worry there are plenty of little treats in this one for everybody. I promise you will \\"laugh out load\\" at least five times.  At least. It was the softer side to this story that I was not expecting, but it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless and turned the book into a true masterpiece.  What caught my eye is when Vonnegut places himself into the story and talks about his suicidal mother, and his farewell to Kilgore Trout at the end which is surprisingly emotional, but wickedly fun.  Here is a sneak preview of a passage I want to share with you that grabbed me when I read it.(which is thrown in very unexpectedly I might add)      \\"This is a very bad book you're writing,\\" I said to myself behind my leaks.(glasses) \\"I know,\\" I said.  \\"You're afraid you'll kill yourself the way your mother did,\\" I said.  \\"I know,\\" I said.      This is Vonnegut letting loose some pretty dark demons in his life at the time. He wrote this book as a gift to himself for his 50th birthday. And for all the great fiction he has written over the years that we have grown to love, that passage was his heart and soul, not fiction. I guess he needed to get that off his chest.     I'm glad he did.    And so on.    Anyway, this is without a doubt a great book on many different levels (if you can get by the racism) from beginning to end. I loved it.  Oh, I almost forgot, the pictures are great too.      Enjoy.
0743454529|5.0|I'm not here to provide spoilers (when will this be outlawed?) or plot summaries.  Be warned:  Once you pick up this book, don't plan on putting it down until you're finished!  I devoted my lunch breaks to this book, stayed up till 1:00 a.m. on work nights, and even read while having a headache (something which I've never done).  If this doesn't clue you in to the greatness of this novel, I don't know what will.      MY SISTER'S KEEPER is narrated by the many people affected by one girl's (Kate's) battle with cancer -- her sister, brother, parents, Guardian Ad Litem, and attorney.  At first, I was a bit aggravated that Anna (the younger sister whose bone marrow repeatedly saves Kate's life) did not narrate more of the chapters.  However, having so many narrators enables the reader to understand the whole picture. This is the only way you'll end up relating to the characters whose choices might enrage you at first.  People directly or indirectly involved in the medical and psychology fields should definitely read this, as well as anyone craving an intense, well-written, controversial novel.  This was my first Jodi Picoult book, and I'm sure I'll be buying another one in the next week.  This book has everything that would draw you into a Lifetime movie, MINUS the corniness and low-budget feel.  SIMPLY FABULOUS!

B000268QB2|5.0|This is a wonderful album. I just cant stop listening to it. Defintely one of the years best and a must have.
B0001WGDXK|5.0|I have a recording of the second symphony which is included in this set. (It was published separately some time ago.) <br />I agree with some of the people here that Bernstein's approach is somewhat different from a \\"standard\\" way the work is usualy interpreted. However, I strongly disagree with the theory that such an approach is wrong or should be avoided. <br />The conductor is an interpret and the purpose of an interpret is to \\"enlighten\\" the work with his own influence and feeling. I value Bernstein's courage and will to work really hard in the intepretation. <br />This recording is usualy compared to that of Sir Colin Davis, who is, indeed, a conductor of a great reputation. Nevertheless, I find his interpretation of the Second somewhat plain, one would say \\"automatic\\". Without a will to find its bits and pieces and make some use of them. <br />Bernstein, on the other hand, plays with every little detail of the work finding emotions and surprises on places Davis leaves quite plain. <br />Although I am generaly into more recent classical music, esp. Shostakovich, this is my most favourite CD of my whole collection. I would always prefer this set to the one of Davis. It's everyone's choice, but this is surely an interresting stuff and that's something that works for me.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Wow this album just blew me away. Very catchy hooks on almost every song. A must have!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|For those of you who love the Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon serials of the 30's, this movie is for you! Think flashback here, because this movie pays homage to all those great sci fi oldies, including \\"Things to Come\\" and the old Superman TV series. Rather than reflect the more modernistic science fiction of today, this movie has chosen to take us back to the stereotypical heroes, villains, and roving reporters of yesteryear. The only thing missing are screaming heroines who need to be rescued, but you can't always have everything! <br /> <br />Really, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. As a fan of science fiction both past and present, this deserves a place beside my favorite serials of the past. Those who evaluate it as such will be pleasantly surprised, especially when you consider you have a movie in this style and genre that doesn't have poor sound, tacky transfer, and occasional cuts due to the quality of the source material. From the moment I saw the Hindenburg blimp crossing the skies, I knew I was in for something wonderful!
B0002NRRAG|4.0|I was introduced to Madeleine Peyroux shortly after the release of 'Dreamland' by hearing her perform live.  I was an immediate fan.  Yes, I immediately had thoughts of a reincarnated Billie Holiday...but not a clone.  I was not disappointed after hearing this release as I believe Madeleine has continued to mature into an artist of note.  Do you think it's possible that Madeleine is not trying to imitate anyone?  If her style and delivery are reminiscent of Billie Holiday, why not celebrate and enjoy her fresh presentations for the same reason you are drawn to Billie's?  To discredit Miss Peyroux is to pay a disservice to both she and the style of delivery you love in Bille.<br /><br />  This cd is a great chill collection and a perfect companion to Dreamland.
B0006Z2LCE|4.0|There is just so much that we reflect on from the 70's and the feel of Disco. Yet, with all the feel of the 70's, we really think of very few acts that still showcase very well within the depths of Disco. Out of all of them, nobody has been able to capitalize on that feeling like Donna Summer has. She has been known as one of those acts that always comes back by surprise. Yet, so many  may feel that she has released oo many hits collections under her belt. Although that might be a bad idea to so many, there are very few that really reflect on the Disco diva from Boston to its limits.<br /><br />Donna Summer: Gold, the 2005 hits collection contains all of her standards that have been widely recognized from her career in so many wanys including She Works Hard For The Money, No More Tears (Enough Is Enough), The Wanderer, On The Radio, and other great songs. The collection also includes some tracks that were overshadowed from other Donna Summer hits collections including Supernatural Love, and Unconditional Love with Musical Youth to name a few. There are so many good songs here, but some might feel that there are just too many hits collections that reflect Donna Summer's career. Yet, some might obligate to choose the 2003 The Journey: Very Best Of Donna Summer collection instead of this one, or any other one Donna has released.<br /><br />Yet, while so many people are into divas that seem like they're manufactured and there music is worthless like Britney Spears, Ashanti and Lindsay Lohan, it is sometimes too easy to forget about guilty pleasures like Donna Summer. Donna Summer: Gold is a great collection for anybody young or old alike who hasn't heard her music before, or for those who want the definitive Donna Summer collection.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: A<br /><br />Songs: A<br /><br />Overal: B 1/2+

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Okay, first things first...I just want to point out that (for those of you who don't know) J. Coronado, the guy who wrote the \\"Chut up and listen\\" review, didn't actually write an original review; he simply copied Roger Ebert's review of the director's cut...go to Roger Ebert's website and see for yourself.  Now, about the movie...I just bought it today.  I own the original and have watched it a lot, but this was like watching a completely different film.  I won't describe all the changes, but now the film plays out very differently; it is slower, more unsettling, and explains some things that didn't really make sense in the original.  The film still (wisely) doesn't explain itself completely, but watching this there were a couple different moments when I suddenly thought \\"Oh, that's what was going on!\\"  If you are a fan of the original you'll almost certainly like this version more, but if you've never seen either versions you should probably see the original first...watching this is kind of like watching one of the LOTR extended versions; more information is given and allows for a greater appreciation of this film.  Now that I've seen Richard Kelly's original vision of Donnie Darko, I can't wait to see what he'll hit us with next!
B0002X314C|5.0|This is the one CD that is absolutely necessary for any good R&B collection. While some may not appreciate Kanye's addition to the album, it gives the production more diversity. I like the more polished aspect of this CD compared to that of a live album. I wasn't expecting everything to be so stripped down. Kanye's tracks like \\"Let's Get Lifted,\\" allow John's voice to really sizzle. If every song was like \\"Ordinary People\\" or \\"Stay With You,\\" it would have been more like Norah Jones. Still great, but will less flare. I think I prefer an ounce of flare for more contemporary rhythm and blues. I think this CD has the right balance. Yes, Kanye's tracks are more Hip-Hop influenced , but for me, it's a good example of what soulful Hip-Hop could sound like without the rap element. But this is without question an R&B album that has a classic soul feel. It's not the Pop/R&B that people are used to. This captures the sound of the more rawer, dynamic, and illustrious R&B that has pretty much been illusive for the past 10-15 years. My only complaint would be that after hearing \\"Selfish\\"on the AOL concert, I wish that collaboration with Kanye would have been on there instead of \\"Number One.\\" Kanye still has a rap on the AOL version, but it was much better than the one he does on \\"Number One.\\" The rap he does on the latter seems a little out of place. It didn't \\"kill\\" the song, but it just wasn't as fluid as the one on \\"Selfish.\\"
B000002OZY|5.0|This is the Who's 3rd masterpiece, and by that I mean 1st masterpiece, since it was released before Who's Next and Quadrophenia, even if it was the 3rd of the masterpieces that I listened to. <br /> <br />Now that I have that out of the way... <br /> <br />1. Overture/It's A Boy - 10/10 A fantastic opening. <br />2. 1921 - 9.5/10 A great song that could make it a bit more clear what the hell is happening.(I'll explain more later on)  <br />3. Amazing Journey/Sparks - 9.5/10  <br />4. Eyesight To The Blind (The Hawker) - 9.5/10   <br />5. Christmas - 10/10 One of the best on the album, a truly underrated gem of a song. Outstanding singing by Daltrey. <br />6. Cousin Kevin - 8.5/10 <br />7. The Acid Queen - 9.6/10   <br />8. Underture - 9.6/10  <br />9. Do You Think It's Alright? - N/A    <br />10. Fiddle About - 8.5/10 <br />11. Pinball Wizard - 10/10 The most famous song from the album and probably one of the best. <br />12. There's A Doctor - N/A  <br />13. Go To The Mirror! - 10/10 One of my personal favorites from this album. Again, outstanding singing by Daltrey. <br />14. Tommy Can You Hear Me? - 10/10 Strangely this was one of the first Who songs I ever heard, and it's catchy as hell.  <br />15. Smash The Mirror - 9.5/10 <br />16. Sensation - 9.7/10 <br />17. Miracle Cure - N/A  <br />18. Sally Simpson - 10/10 Another highlight...   <br />19. I'm Free - 9.7/10 <br />20. Welcome - 9.3/10 <br />21. Tommy's Holiday Camp - N/A    <br />22. We're Not Gonna Take It - 10/10  A great way to close the album. <br /> <br />Overall - 10/10 <br /> <br />I didn't rate many of the shorter songs because they are mostly 20 seconds long, and rating them would only needlessly drag the album's score down. <br /> <br />Either this or Who's Next is The Who's 2nd best album, and both are very high up in my top 10(which includes over 20 albums because I can't make decisions). My only (somewhat minor) problem with this album is that the story is a bit vague. \\"1921\\" is about Tommy's father murdering the guy that his wife is cheating on him with(I'm pretty sure at least), but it not really clear at all. They basically skip right over the murder. <br /> <br />Oh, well, still an icredible album by the world's greatest rock band, The Who. <br />
B00005Y7AW|5.0|I think that Rufus Wainright is brilliant. The first that i heard of him was in I Am Sam, and i thought he did a beautiful job on the cover song \\" Across the Universe\\"- I kept an eye out for him and later discovered Want One and was to say the least obsessed. In the words of Garden State- \\" you gotta hear this song. It will change your life.\\" Everything he writes is definatly original and that goes for not only his lyrics but the music as well, I can honestly say i've never heard anything like him, and i hope it stays that way. As far as i'm concerned if you don't like this album or see anything in at least one of his albums, than you must be anti-art appreciative.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|When first heard \\"I Don't Want To Be \\" on the radio I felt in love for the song.   I looked for Gavin's CD everywhere, but could not find it. I'm from Brazil and he's not exactly popular here.  However, a friend of mine went to the US and I asked him to bring this CD for me.   It was the best gift I could ever have. I listen to this CD all the time. I'm convinced that I'm addicted to it.  My favorites songs are \\"Nice to meet you anyway\\", \\"Follow through\\" and \\"Just friends\\", besides, of course, \\"I Don't Want To Be\\".  If you have any doubts concerning DeGraw's quality as a singer, I really think you should listen to this CD with your mind completely opened to try a very pleasant music journey.
B0002Z1EG2|3.0|This was a good CD, but I wish she would go back to her roots.  While it has all my favorite songs minus a few from her other CD's, I really wish she would go back.  I was comparing her with Jaci Rae's CD, Can't Push A River that I purchased here and really, I LOVE Jaci's CD.  You should check it out.
B0000DBJ2B|1.0|Of course everyone already knows \\"The Dark Crystal\\" is Jim Henson's Masterpiece, but this so-called \\"Collector's Edition\\" version is probably the biggest rip-off in DVD history!  It comes in a cardboard box that looks nice on the outside, but its cheesiness becomes apparent when you open it up.  Inside is a little notepad, a piece of film embedded in a card, a little note written by Jim Henson's daughter, and ONE lonely disc.  Said disc offers ZERO improvement over the previously released (and MUCH more reasonably priced) \\"Special Edition.\\"  Compare this to the FOUR discs you get in one of the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions for significantly less money!  My advice: Skip this \\"Collector's Edition\\" and buy the \\"Special Edition\\" along with the beautiful Brian Froud book, \\"[[ASIN:0810945797 The World of the Dark Crystal: The Collector's Edition]]\\" (available here at Amazon).
B00006879E|5.0|I LOVE this cd. it is non stop musical pleasure from beggining to end. Adam Levine writes better than any other artist on the scene today. The vocals are amazing but like i said these lyrics put so called artist like britney spears and ashanti to shame. good charlotte, simple plan, and hoobastank all need to take a seat and listen to this incredible band maybe learn a thing or two. Best cd of 2004 go out and get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0765310015|3.0|I was lost after the first 100 pages but interested. After 600 pages I was just as lost and confused but wanted to get the next book. There are so many players, gods, demigods, elders, societies, cultures etc without explanation or a map as to how they fit together...the characters are in the know but only give you glimpses. I will continue to read if only to get a handle on this world.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is Weezer's best album, hands down. Every song is perfect. Just coming into the rock scene, Weezer offered fabulous, catchy pop-rock tunes consistent throughout this self titled debut. The songwriting is nothing special but it's solid, the tunes are ultra catchy and very fun to listen to, and it's very fresh sounding.<br /><br />Best Songs:<br /><br />Undone(The Sweater Song): A very smooth guitar rhythm with a favourable chorus. Great song. One of Weezer's best.<br /><br />No One Else: Very catchy and fun.<br /><br />My name is Jonas: A wonderful start to a perfect album. A great guitar intro and then it gets right into the rock.<br /><br />In the Garage: The best word to describe this song is: Catchy.  It also has a great guitar melody.<br /><br />Only in Dreams: The slowest song off the album, it is the perfect closer. A fabulous song.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best album ever released by Weezer. Every song is great and it will have you singing along in no time. Highly recommended to any Weezer fan or anyone who loves catchy pop-rock tunes.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I was really surprised at how good this film was.  I did not expect much and it was quite glorious. I loved the black and white beginning and how it \\"transforms\\" into color.  I loved the background of the Phantom's childhood that we never saw on stage. And the actress playing Christine; holy cow!! But Gerard Butler was very ho-hum as the Phantom.  I can't say he was bad, but with a role like this, a good actor can really make a mark and put his stamp on a role.  Butler did not do this.  <br />Hats off to director Schumacher who, after destroying the BATMAN franchise, rises like a Pheonix to direct a truly sumptuous first rate musical!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|Saw was interesting.  I think I was expecting a more senseless out-and-out gore fest and while it is gorey, it pretends to have higher aspirations.  That is actually what kind of diminsihed the film's fun factor for me.  The whole theme about appreciating life, the cat and mouse intrigue were fine - actually it then raised my expectations for the film.  The problem is that after that, the script gets a little sloppy.  The ending is quite frustrating and just a little too silly given the greater depth they had hinted at earlier.  Some fine scary moments and supsense are guaranteed however.<br /><br />Elwes' real accent keeps slipping out toward the end as his anger and fustration mount and numerous folks have pointed out the kill-him-while-you-have-him gaffe that occurs multiple times.  Both annoying factors as the film moves along.  Still, it can be a fun ride for thriller people.
0385512058|4.0|For all the five-star reviews that are going to pop up here in the next few days, be cognizant that the author of this book is a master networker, and is adept at calling in favors. What follows is an unbiased look at the book. <br /> <br />The author's message is simple yet powerful: Everything you do in life is enabled by others. The more people you know, the more you are capable of, and the more you are capable of helping others. The power of your network goes up exponentially with the number of relationships and with the strength of those relationships. Anyone who thinks that success is based solely on merit is sadly delusional. <br /> <br />The advice and techniques he gives are broken out by chapter. Some are insightful and useful, such as discovering what's important to people and finding ways to help them, how to work conferences, and how to connect with other well-connected people. Others are questionable from a style standpoint, and seem to serve as a boastful review of the author's own methods, such as his extravagant dinner parties, or interrupting a conversation midstream in order to call someone who is relevant to the current topic. He also emphasizes constant emailing and calling just so you don't fall off someone's radar, even if you have nothing to say to that person except \\"I exist\\". How annoying.  <br /> <br />The book gets 3 stars for being important and relevant. It gets another for getting down and dirty in the details of connecting with people. It doesn't get the fifth star for being verbose, sometimes repetitive, and for taking such an extreme stance when most of us are mere networking mortals. At its core, the ideas in this book are incredibly valuable, once you adapt them to your own personality.
B00005JMXX|4.0|True, the story line is a bit far fetched, the movie dove into the plot with confusing speed, and some things (such as the wolves) were predictable . . . Still I liked it.  \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" passed my prime tests for a film even if it doesn't stand up well as a social statement.  Then again, I wasn't in the mood for a social statement when I watched it.<br /><br />Test #1  It kept me glued to my seat.  The action came with enough speed that I didn't want to slip out for popcorn for fear I would miss something.  I wasn't watching my clock, and when the movie was over I didn't feel as if I'd wasted the evening.<br /><br />Test #2  Although much of it was a formula film, just enough was different that I didn't feel like I was watching a remake of something I've already seen before.<br /><br />Test #3  The next day I would have been willing to watch it again with another member of my family.<br /><br />Test #4  I could actually imagine someone adding it to their DVD collection.<br /><br />So what if it doesn't seem realistic (like most of Hollywood makes sense???).  This film is a keeper.
B00003CX5P|1.0|...not by this movie, but by the number of Star Wars apologists on Amazon.Com! There are people rating this four and five stars, but their review contains nothing but digs at every aspect of the film, excluding the visual effects. People spending hundreds of words to say why the movie is bad, then turning around and saying they loved it, and proclaiming it \\"100% Star Wars.\\" This was NOT Star Wars. Seeing this in the theater was like being in a bad dream. I'd wanted to see the prequels for so long, and was utterly let down in every way. The idiotic introduction of \\"midi-chlorians\\" stomped all over the spiritual aspect of the originals...that mastery of the force was all about spiritual and mental focus, and belief. Now it's just about how many of the right cells you've got. Ridiculous. I could go on ad infinitum about Jar Jar Binks, the worst character ever introduced in film, but that's been done to death. Jake Lloyd has already taken his lumps for his awful performance, as have others...so I won't belabor that point, either. <br /> <br />The fact is, the characters of the original trilogy are icons for a reason - you CARED about them. We don't care about any of the characters in the prequel trilogy - they are all completely disposable. We know what becomes of everyone of significance in the story, the rest of the characters are one-dimensional and unimportant. The Jedi Council is a rogues gallery of makeup artists at work, but not a single one will be remembered...let alone acheive iconic status. Shouldn't they have made more of an impact on us than the characters in Jabba's palace, who we only saw for a few minutes? In fact, who still cares about Darth Maul? Nobody. He was a microcosm of these prequels - all flash, no substance. I was bitterly disappointed by both the two prequel movies and I'm praying for a small amount of redemption in the third, but I feel Lucas has lost his way and is now only good at putting effects on-screen...which is more a testament to the talented staff of ILM than anything. But the long line of digital characters rolled out by his effects company do nothing to match the simple, rubber-mask charm of Greedo or the denizens of Mos Eisley Cantina...just as none of his main characters can hold a candle to the charisma and charm of Han Solo. <br /> <br />In twenty years, nobody will be talking about the prequel films. No future filmmakers will hold them up as the movies that inspired their career choice. They are disposable entertainment for an audience that has apparently become so easily amused that ANYTHING is passable, as long as their eyeballs are entertained by \\"great graphics.\\" Final Fantasy: The Movie was panned by critics and viewers, but I'd argue that it had every bit as much depth and made just as much sense as the Star Wars prequels have. <br /> <br />So that's my rant, just had to get it out of my system.
B0006J28BO|3.0|The studio that released brilliant films such as Grave of the Fireflies (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), and Spirited Away (2001) brings the audience another fantasy tale.  This script was passed over by the anime master Hiyao Miyazaki and the first time director Hiroyuki Morita got his chance to make a film.  Morita proves that it is very difficult to follow in the footsteps of his mentor Hiyao Miyazaki with whom he worked when they made Kiki's Delivery Service.  Nonetheless, Hiroyuki Morita gives his best effort, as he presents to the world his first feature, Cat Returns.<br /><br />The young high school girl Haru struggles with her life, as she frequently oversleeps, her clumsiness surface due to stress, and she often arrives late to school.  Her peers only notice her when she comes late, or something awkward happens to her.  On top of this she seems to be a magnet for accidents, as balls hit her head and she is at the wrong place at the wrong time.  This leads Haru to question why these bad events happen to her.  Her best friend points out that it might be a bad omen, and her life might get much worse in the near future.<br /><br />On the way home from school Haru notices a cat that is about to cross the road.  What the cat does not see is that a truck is about to run him over, but fortunately to the cat's best interest Haru leaps across the street and saves the cat with her lacrosse stick.  When they land the cat stands up on his two back paws and brushes off the dust. Haru cannot believe her eyes and when the cat begins to talk it is too much for her.  The cat promises to return later to properly express his gratitude, which only leaves Haru in a stammering bewilderment.<br /><br />During the night Haru receives a Royal visit from the Cat King of the Cat Kingdom who wants to personally display his appreciation of the brave rescue of his son.  The Cat King on the other hand is a laidback furry thing that seems to enjoy his sleep more than anything, as he ushers out the words \\"Thanks a lot, babe.\\"  The cats hand over a parchment to her, which states what they promise to give her, as a gift of their deepest appreciation.  These gifts, however, are more suitable for cats, as Haru is overwhelmed with cattail plants, catnip, and neatly packaged mice.<br /><br />After a tough day Haru bumps into one of the Cat King's clerks to whom she vents her anger and expresses that she has no use for the gifts that were given to her, as she is not a cat.  Embarrassed for the mistake the cat clerk seeks to rectify the error, as he hears about Haru's troubles.  This leads the cat clerk to disclose that the Cat King has decided to make Haru his daughter-in-law.<br /><br />Troubled by the Cat King's persistence she fears that she might not escape the planned marriage to the cat.  When her anxiety is at its strongest, in regards to the cat marriage, she hears a voice out of thin air that tells her to go to the Cat Bureau for help.  Haru follows the voice's suggestion, which leads her to meet Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, Muta, and Toto.  Together with her new friends she is about to embark on an adventure to try to stop the arranged cat marriage, which does not come with little difficulty.<br /><br />The use of humanoid felines brings a cheerful, yet bizarre atmosphere to the story.  Creepiness of the film is further enhanced through the story, as the main characters enter the Cat Kingdom.  The journey into the Cat Kingdom and the Cat Kings behavior brings notions of Alice in Wonderland, which also has an eerie mood through Alice's venture with the mysterious land that she entered.  The Cat King's true nature appears later when the audience meets him for the second time, and he is not the same nice and laidback pussycat that he was the first time.<br /><br />Cat Returns borrows some elements from other animated films such as Whisper of the Heart (1995), which introduced the Baron.  The strong element of felines is also present in Kiki's Delivery Service, which seems to follow the director.  These borrowed elements do not harm the cinematic experience.  On contrary, it enhances the film, and its value. However, the character development is rather narrow and limited, unlike Spirited Away or Kiki's Delivery Service.  This could possibly have something to do with the short running time of the film, which is no more than 75 minutes and within this narrow time frame much must be covered.  In addition, the theme does not seem to be fully developed, as there seems to be some plot holes in the story.  This means that Morita does not measure up with his mentors, but he shows a strong promise as a future anime artist.  Nonetheless, Cat Returns offers a joyous cinematic experience that will most likely be mostly enjoyed by anime fans, children, and feline lovers.nt in Kiki's Delivery Service, which seems to follow the director.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Winds is loosely based on an old Japanese legend known as The Princess Who Loved Insects that has its roots in the 12th century.  In this tale a princess openly displays her liking for insects, especially caterpillars.  However, her mother finds it repulsive and demands that she quits her unlady-like behavior, but she refuses, as she desires to enlighten that all creatures are wonderful and have an important function to mankind.  Same theme is used in Nausica&auml;, but with a fantastic adventure where the destiny of the world is at stake, as the young princess Nausica&auml; spreads her compassionate and affectionate love without boundaries.<br /><br />Nausica&auml; is a fearless young teenager that has deep affection for the natural beauty of the world.  This affection roots within her morals and values, which are based on trust, compassion, and understanding.  This is an understanding that all creatures live on the same terms under the same sun despite appearance.  However, it is how things appear that brings birth to fear in the people of Nausica&auml;'s world, as a vast poisonous jungle is expanding its boarders into the realm of human beings. Inside the jungle exists gigantic insects that when threatened are consumed by rage, which roots itself in fear, as they attack the threat without mercy.  Recognizing the power of fear elevates Nausica&auml;'s understanding that fear is the source of evil, and if fear is eradicated then harmony can exist.<br /><br />Different kingdoms within the futuristic world of Nausica&auml; fight for power to control the world, as they all believe their concept of peace is the correct answer.  The leaders of each kingdom are willing to wipe out each other in the quest for peace, which includes burning down the poisonous jungle and all the insects despite historical evidence that war and burning down the poisonous jungle is ineffective, and in the past it has brought mankind closer to extinction.  This destructive concept is essentially a uniform belief within all leaders of the world while they rely on their might in firepower.  However, Nausica&auml; acknowledges the importance of harmony within the world and between all beings, but others are not willing to listen.  The leaders turn their deaf ear to Nausica&auml;, as they firmly believe, a belief rooted in fear and other emotions, that they are right while they unknowingly are about to bring the world to extinction.<br /><br />Hayao Miyazaki who is best known for Spirited Away (2001) directed this magnificent tale about Nausica&auml;, which in many ways is groundbreaking.  The hero of the story is a confident young girl, which was almost unheard of before the film was made.  Through this character Miyazaki brings important notions for the audience to ponder such as environmental issues, war, and a positive life philosophy that stems in acceptance and love.  Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Winds uniqueness radiates through its multifaceted moral lessons that can be hard to follow for young audiences.  Nonetheless, Miyazaki remains true to the purpose of storytelling without using cinematic clich&eacute;s from other films, which is to elevate understanding and wisdom of how to better one's own life.  In essence, Miyazaki's visual journey lays the ground work for later wonderful anime films such as Grave of Fireflies (1988), Whisper of the Heart (1995), and Princess Mononoke (1997), which was developed through decades of hard work.<br /><br />The story of Nausica&auml;'s adventure brings several interesting notions for the audience to contemplate.  Many of these ideas are not foreign, but are presented in an appealing way, which could be easily accessible for adults and teens.  Young children might enjoy the animation, but miss the complex message.  Yet, these children will remember the film through its wonderful animation together with the films score, which will echo in their head for months after having seen the film.  An interesting thought would be if the United Nations would make Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Winds required viewing for all of the world leaders, as a lesson to help making better decisions in regards to humanity.  Nonetheless, Nausica&auml; takes the audience on a breathtaking and suspenseful journey, which will leave the viewers in deep thoughts.d Nations would make Nausica of the Valley of the Winds required viewing for all of the world leaders, as a lesson to help making better decisions in regards to humanity.

B0000028UK|4.0|Leaving aside the 'messages' within the songs, I simply enjoyed the songs and I definitely did not hear anything wrong with the song 'Daughter'. This is another of a Pearl Jam album that the band experimented with fusing grunge with pure rock beats and they did it well. Yes some of the lyrics has a bit to be desired for however you can't expect the lyrics to be 100% right in every darn record.<br /><br />I'm a discerning fan however some fans expect too much or way over expectation. Just enjoy the music dont look for faults or you will find many of them. This album should just be enjoyed for the entertainment value it was brought out for.<br /><br />The pick of the album songs that I most enjoyed from this album were; 'Glorified', 'Blood' and 'Leash'.
B00005JLO2|2.0|I first saw this movie when it came out and all I remembered was that it was OK but there was something about it that really bothered me.  <br /> <br /> <br />Well just saw the DVD and yup the movie still bothered me. It was very very hard to believe that our hero, who comes from a military family and is engaged to a military girl, decides to up and quit when his unit was ordered to the Sudan to fight the Mahdi 'Muslim' rebels. The resignation, presentation of the four feathers of cowardice and his departure to the Sudan happens in such a flash in the movie that it really leaves the viewer wondering 'whaaaaa..... ' <br /> <br /> <br />OK not to stretch the review for an old so -so film I actually liked the black slave that adopts our hero and saves the cowards life over and over ... this guy was fabulous and is the only reason I gave the movie two stars ....  <br /> <br /> <br />Our coward .. well he just returned to the UK and AGAIN forgot  and deserted the people that helped him the most ...  <br /> <br /> <br />It certainly is a bad movie about a weak character ! <br />
B000002BYD|4.0|'YIELD' has some very fine songs that is indicative of Pearl Jam experimenting. Mixed in with the smooth rock beats and the heavy vocals of Vedder is an almost playfulness of experimentation that showed listeners that PO has a sublime harmonic side. It was a great album to listen too and I quite enjoyed 'Faithful', 'Wishlist', 'Do The Evolution' and 'All Those Yesterdays'.<br /><br />This is the 1998 release and shows Pearl Jam has a highy successful band that survived time and the years and are still evolving.
B000002H33|5.0|<br />Most of the songs are top-notch, some of their best and highest-energy material.  Disposable Heroes started to sound cheezy after a few listens, and Orion became boring.  Other than those, I can listen to this over and over, and still get a rush. <br /> <br />The production is the best.  All the playing is crisp and full, like it's right in front of you. <br /> <br />Well worth the investment, even though the band makes money off you...unless you buy a used copy. <br /> <br />Songwriting: 9/10 <br />Musicianship: 10/10 <br />Sound Quality: 10/10 <br />Originality: 10/10 <br />
B0000004V2|5.0|For me, who has been an eager listner for last 25 years, This is THE GREATEST ALBUM in ROCK HISTORY. Beach Boys' Pet Sounds could be arguable, but Stone Roses excels it in many ways. Of course, Beatles made many great albums but none of them tops SR.    I even began to trust NME when I saw this album made No. 1 in their \\"great rock albums poll\\" in 2003.     So, no one can say s/he is a genuine rock music listner without fully appreciating this classic. Buy it, period.
B000002JNJ|4.0|<br />If you like Dimebag's style, this is a good choice.  There's plenty of jamming in just the right dose.  And it's not overwhelmed by Phil's screaming and cursing, as on later albums. <br /> <br />The drums and bass are out there too.  All playing is heavy and/or fast, yet clean and thought-out. <br /> <br />Songwriting: 8/10 <br />Musicianship: 10/10 <br />Sound Quality: 9/10 <br />Originality: 9/10

B000002JOH|5.0|<br />This is the album where they strike a nice balance between DD's virtuosity and the band's trademark rawness and aggression. <br /> <br />More funky and hook-oriented than CFH.  <br /> <br />Songwriting: 9/10 <br />Musicianship: 10/10 <br />Sound Quality: 9/10 <br />Originality: 10/10

B000002H2H|5.0|<br />MOP and JFA have some of my favorite songs, but I go back to this one the most.  One reason is that I can listen to it all the way through without skipping. <br /> <br />\\"Fight Fire...\\" is one of the best examples of Mt's high-energy speed-chugging.  All the rest are solid, classic Mt., including the instrumental. <br /> <br />MOP can still be your first stop for 80s Mt.  But be sure to get this one too.

B00008BXJF|5.0|Crimso's last album(and maybe THE last, as guiding light Robert Fripp has mentioned that he will cease touring forever or something like that)may perhaps be their best ever. Definetly their most cohesive, as it has a beginning middle and end, rather than just a collection of material done up in any sequence. It has flow, atmosphere, drama. This is Crimson's most futuristic sounding album since 'Three Of A Perfect Pair'. There are moments of driving, violent agression as well as moments of stunning beauty.  <br />       In fact it is somewhat of a concept album, the theme being that life is hard and there is no hope- yet there is hope, and if there is hope then all is changed. Because hope is unreasonable, and love is greater than this. Or something of that effect, this from the Fripp-man himself. There is a constant recurring theme running through the album that pops up during several intervals. A comparison could be made with Crimso's 'In The Wake Of Poseidon' album from 1970. But in actuallity this music here sounds like it's from 2070. Concept album or nay, this is no boring rehashed prog-rock album. King Crimson have distanced themselves even further from such limiting categories. This is more Tool than ELP. And its not to long either. This is no dragged-out 75 minute affair with filler. At only 54 minutes long, Crimson say what they need to and then get the hell out of dodge.   <br /> <br />  A few things must be noted: <br />1)The production has improved from 2000's 'ConstruKction Of Light', they used outside producer Machine. The result is excellent. <br />2)This is the definitive album of this lineup(Fripp/Adrian Belew/Trey Gunn/Pat Mastellotto). All members are firing on all cylinders. Fripp has a larger role other than mere soundscaping. <br />3)The artwork fits.  <br /> <br />the trax: <br />POWER TO BELEIVE I - just Adrian's voice through some fx, recalling 'Peace-a Beginning' from 'In The Wake Of Poseidon'. These words will reappear throughout the album and is the central theme. <br /> <br />LEVEL FIVE - an abrasive instrumental which out-Reds RED and out-Thraks THRAK. CRUNCH! CRUNCH! Sounds of guitars being melted as they cry out in agony.  <br /> <br />EYES WIDE OPEN - A vocal track with interlocking guitars which reminds somewhat of Discipline era Crimson. Nice drumming from Mr. Mastellotto, you don't miss Bill Bruford in any way. A song about being open to what life has to offer. My only complaint for this album that Crimson doesn't utilize Adrian's voice or more song-based material any more. But I suppose that makes the more traditional 'songs' stand out even more. <br /> <br />ELEKRIK - a modern avant garde tone poem of epic porportions. This is well written and executed. I could say this is this album's 'Fracture' or 'Lark's Tongues' but that would be selling it short. Incredible journey of sound. <br /> <br />FACTS OF LIFE(intro) - a rather unnecessary soundscape introduction, they should have just launched into the song proper. But perhaps, like the 'Power To Beleive' tracks, it serves as an interval to set up the next journey. <br /> <br />FACTS OF LIFE - CRUNCHY IN MILK!!! This song grabs you by the sack and shakes vigoresly. The middle solo has Fripp sounding like someone kicked him into a meat grinder as he was crunching out, blistered hands and all. Play loud.  <br /> <br />POWER TO BELEIVE II - a dreamy soundscapey performance recalling 'Sheltering Sky' maybe. Not a wrong note to be found. It could not have been perfected. This is music true to the moment. Of those there are few. Stunning. <br /> <br />DANGEROUS CURVES - takes the album into even darker climate, similar to 'Devil's Triangle' for its repetitous 'Mars'-like rhythm. Once Pat comes in on 'traps and buttons', things lock into a dangerous groove. <br /> <br />HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE HAPPY WITH - another crunchy one, a humorous Crimsonesque take on all those nu-metal bands with lots of anger and testosterone but nothing original to say or play.  <br /> <br />POWER TO BELEIVE III - as the journey winds down we only get a short snippet of the vocal theme before the band drags you into hostile and alien territory. This is truely King Crimson out in the deep end. A very dramatic and atmospheric climax. <br /> <br />POWER TO BELEIVE IV - this album ends on a short, reflective note, and is the most beautiful soundscape Fripp has ever put to disc. Possibly the most beautiful moment in Crimson's history. It just caps it all off. Full circle. If Crimson were to disband forever now, they would have left on a high note.  <br /> <br />I don't think this album can be matched for its scope or its continuity. Stunning album, stunning. Something that can never be repeated. There may not be any hope of anything to match the magic of this 2003 album. But hope is unreasonable, and love is greater than this.
B000002H6C|4.0|<br />Many say \\"One\\" is the best song on this album.  But others are just as good or better, especially the title track. <br /> <br />This often gets a bashing for production quality, which is somewhat deserved.  Even a non-audiophile like me notices the weak tapping of the drums and the lack of bass end.  But don't let that stop you from buying one of their best and most innovative albums. <br /> <br />All songs are good or excellent, with the possible exception of the last one, which seems self-indulgent, and out-of-place with the other songs and the overall theme. <br /> <br />Songwriting: 9/10 <br />Musicianship: 10/10 <br />Sound Quality: 7/10 <br />Originality: 9/10
B0006SSOHM|1.0|What can I say about such a dumb movie! The whole movie is about 2 guys in a disgusting bathroom who have to save their lives...or die! It makes NO sense!!! Many times a cop will have a gun pointed at the killer, but WON'T SHOOT! I would not recommend this movie, and I'll never watch it again because it's just plain stupid! The ending is really weird and nasty..but the one word to describe the movie is DUMB!!!
B000002JR8|3.0|<br />A few nice, funky songs--some of their best and most original.  The rest is filler and noise. <br /> <br />Phil's screaming and cursing often drowns out the musicians.  DD's playing is less inventive and often degenerates into unintelligible, over-distorted pounding. <br /> <br />You can tell that they ran out of ideas half-way through this one, and fell back on their \\"more obnoxious than the previous album\\" formula, as well as a carbon copy of Sabbath's Planet Caravan. <br /> <br />Songwriting: 5/10 <br />Musicianship: 6/10 <br />Sound Quality: 5/10 <br />Originality: 5/10
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael has developed his own style with this album.  His voice is so outstanding that I believe he has the ability to sing anything.  I love this album as I did his first two albums.
B000089CJI|5.0|After I heard this CD for the first time, I could barely listen to anything else for weeks. I listened to it soften that, after a month or so, I ruined it for myself and had to take a break. <br /> <br />Then, I stated listening to it again, and it was as beautiful as ever. \\"Nothing Better,\\" \\"Brand New Colony,\\" and, especially \\"This Place is a Prison\\" are the best songs on the CD, but there really isn't a track that on here that isn't great. Highly recommended.
B00005QY5Y|2.0|It is not unlikely that a person who purchases this album does so because apparently it is no longer available the soundtrack of the movie \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" starring Gene Hackman, a movie that has a terrific soundtrack. <br />On newsgroups can be learned that one of those songs, the one at the end of the movie, would have been Ryan Adam's \\"The Rescue Blues\\". <br /> <br />Be careful: if you arrived to this cd with that intention in mind and that Rock in mind, the track in this album titled \\"the Rescue Blue\\" might not be what you assumed or hoped for. If you have in mind that terrific music at the end of the movie, and if on  newsgroups you are being told it is this one, well, simply: that movie song you are thinking of is not the one listed here as \\"the Rescue Blues\\". Simply. <br /> <br />Aside from that as long as you like Ryan Adams, the cd can be good, but if (I said if) you want to buy this cd hoping to find that song from that movie soundtrack, you'd waste (not too much though) money, that is.
B0006399FS|1.0|For the long-time fan base: This a carefully marketed corporate product. This is not U2, all this is just hype, cover magazines, tickets, Grammy Awards, Itunes, MTV, radio airplay, etc. <br /> <br />It is a put-on sellout \\"U2\\" sound delivered with arrogance and decadence to the art. Do not support this heinous offense not only music but U2's legacy too. U2 have become in 4 sellout emtpy men who are cashing in big time on teeny bopper's allowance money. <br />
B000002H97|5.0|I haven't always been a big metal fan, but this CD has gotten me out of the closet so to speak. The lyrics are just phenomenal, and this CD just rocks! Simple as that. It doesn't sound dated either, like some rock bands tend to sound after 15 or so years.  <br />It still sounds fresh, like it still has much to offer. Just don't be afraid to look under the bed!
B000063UR2|5.0|\\"Nothing is more magical then a unicorn. As long as they roam the earth no evil can touch the pure of heart.\\" But Lilly can not resists, she touches the unicorn though it is forbidden and thus starts a cascade of events that nearly ends in the extinction of the species, and the destruction of the world as she knows it. Thus Jack, a woodland child who loves Lilly, must save the last unicorn from a horrible sacrifice by the devil himself.<br /><br />Filled with fairies, magic, and charm beyond this world, \\"Legend\\" is a wonderful movie for all ages. The graphics are wonderful, sets and costumes beautiful and frightening in the right moments. A superb movie on all accounts.
B0006399FS|1.0|Just read those bunch of childish 5 stars reviews from R.Johnson or MRe \\"BW\\". Their reviews just display dumbness and brianwashing. So, if you dislike this album you are not a U2 fan, you don't know about music, right?... <br /> <br />Having evidently lost their ability for brevity in album titling (after all, this is the band that brought you such albums as Boy, War, and Pop, not to mention Zooropa and Achtung Baby, which sounded cool even if they were more than one syllable), U2's second consecutive exercise in forcing their fans to create an acronym to save time winds up creating an intriguing paradox.  <br /> <br />How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb (heretofore recognized as HTDAAB; pronunciation is up to you), the band's follow-up to the nonsense overrated smash All That You Can't Leave Behind (ATYCLB) isn't the sweeping, grandiose musical statement you might expect from such 80's and 90's band, rather it does serve as a tragic document of a veteran band settling into a pathetic career-salvaging maneuver in such selling out way. <br /> <br />The band is getting critical praise for retreading old areas and avenues!!! The album is so safe, ordinary, cliche, lame, stupid, pointless, heared before, short and commercial and will no doubt serve Bono's ego fix after the unpopular - but brilliant - post Achtung Baby era (1993-1998, their best era as an innovative avant garde band, if you ask me). Shame for giving up in to market forces. <br /> <br />It would be mature of them to retire now, everybody's know they're going downhill, but I know this won't happen. We'll just have to watch a slow and painful death of a band over the next 5 to 10 years. <br /> <br />That's enough U2 is over.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006IIKS0|1.0|This was like watching a 3 year old cry and complain about his little sister taking his toys. My view of the tough guys of Metallica quickly vanished as I watched three selfish and self-centered men complain about how they weren't \\"feeling\\" right about this and that.  <br /> <br />Towards the end, they film a video at San Quentin Prison. I kept thinking that if those gang members had seen the previous footage of the documentary, they wouldn't be rocking, they'd be ... <br /> <br />At the end, they're reminiscing about \\"what they've come through\\" and the look on Trujillo's face (the new bassist who wasn't involved up till then) is classic: \\"What did I get myself into?\\" <br />
B000059QYB|5.0|I really liked this music album, or CD I should call it.  The songs were all written poetically.  I'm not sure which song is my favorite.  I think I like them all.  It's definately going to be a classic and music lovers will enjoy it.  Billy Idol definately rocks well.
0385474547|4.0|I had to read Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe for my history class as a freshman in high school, and as far as books that I have to read for school go, it wasn't that bad. It accurately depicted the white man invading the Africans and taking away their land and stripping away their customs, trying to force their own culture on the Africans.  <br /> Imperialism harmed the ibo people more than it helped them. Imperialism turned the ibo people against themselves, by tearing them apart with religion. They converted many ibo people to Christianity, and tried to convert the polytheism others. They stirred conflict by murdering the ibo's sacred python, the emanation of the god of water, which led to anger between the traditional believers and the new believers. Another downside of imperialism is it led to many deaths. The white settlers murdered all the people of Abame when they killed one of them, many of the new white settlers were killed, and imperialism led to Okonkwo killing himself. Imperialism caused many problems, the two greatest were it tore the villages apart, and it led to many deaths. <br /> Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe is a respectable book because it is accurate in portraying the Africans reaction to the white settlers in the times of imperialism. It is a good read, and if you are curious about the imperialism of Africa, I suggest you pick up a copy of it. <br />
B0006U4UAU|4.0|Special features. Enhanced content. Bonus CDs. It's becoming de rigeur to tack extra gubbins onto most every new release these days. And, while it's nice to feel like you're getting a bit of extra bang for your buck, you've really got to wonder: like, why bother? How many times are you really going to sit through the extended version of \\"Return of the King\\", the \\"making of\\" documentary and director's commentary on that special edition DVD you just splurged on, or the demos and B-sides CD that came with the remastered version of 'Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain'? Answer: not much. <br />LCD Soundsystem's debut album, then, marks an interesting diversion in this morass of faux-bonus uselessness. Might this be the first instance in which a bonus CD has actually usurped the main feature to whose bosom it furtively clung? Whisper it, now: possibly. <br />It would, of course, be brutally unfair to damn LCD's effort with such faint praise: simply put, this is a pretty good album. The first four tracks, in particular, are - in their own respective ways - absolute stormers. The others, though less immediate, do kinda grow on you. But... Lordy! that second CD is fantastic. 'Losing My Edge' and 'Yeah' are two of the best singles to have been released so far this decade and, blah blah blah. <br /> <br />Anyway... 3 stars for the album, 5 for the bonus CD. What a warped world we live in.
0743244257|1.0|Have been traveling allot lately (thus the light postings).  I was in Portland three weeks ago and met my brother for coffee at &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">Powells&lt;/a>.  Powells is literally a candy store for the book owner.  Sprawling now over more than one square city block, you are handed a map to the sections when you walk in.  Just on my way through the technical section to the coffee shop, I picked up five books.  Unfortunately I should have figured out from the $5.98 sales price on Cosmopolis (regularly $13.00) that something was fishy.  Even though it was in the \\"staff recommendations\\" section.  I keep forgetting that many times what the staff of a bookstore like Powells likes is somewhat like what indie film fanatics like in movies.  Quirky, off beat tomes that appeal to a very limited audience.<br /><br />That is Cosmopolis in spades.  I don't know the person who recommended it, but I bet he/she only wears black, lives in shared housing with other tortured souls and fancies themselves \\"alternative\\".  I like many alternative things.  Many times the best ideas come from the fringes.  In Cosmopolis's case though, only dull insipid self serving slop is served up though.  I made it to page 89 before giving up for a total lack of interest.  Completely uninteresting characters, poor structure, and no obvious point.  By half way through a \\"novel\\" (a stretch at 200 pages paperback) you should at least CARE what the hell happens to the characters.  The depth of my apathy was so deep that I almost left the book in the hotel this morning.  But then I thought the world deserved to know how pathetic this drivel was.  If my sacrifice of a couple hours can save even one soul the torture (and lost money) of this waste of natural resources then I might get back some of the karma this thing sucked away.<br /><br />The Martin Tobias rating of 1-5, this gets a ZERO.  Run away.
B00000J7J4|1.0|This is sad.  Santana used to have a SOUND and PASSION.  Now poor Carlos sounds like he's a guest  on other peoples' albums.   <br />The current formula seems to be, get whoever is flavor of the month (\\"hot\\") and get the whole bunch on a salable but forgettable and artistically bankrupt \\"product\\".   <br />Of course a year or two down the line the truth is evident (Matchbox 20 anyone?). <br />Ditto for Shaman. <br />The truth is that after Michelle Branch has finally pudged out and dissapeared along with all the other pop tinsel and fluff Santana insists on \\"collaborating\\" with Carlos will still be around.  Carlos, YOU are the future.  PLease move on. <br />
B00005JNEW|5.0|I'm not sure what film the previous reviewer was watching. I found the film to be incredibly good from start to finish. The events are true, so if it contains a few 'cliches', well.... such is the stuff of life.<br />It's very well acted (Thornton is awesome); the high school players are quite believeable, and you'll find yourself really rooting for them by the end of the movie. The final game is, by all definition, a barn burner. (Reminds me of a CFL playoff game.... right down to the wire.) If you know a bit about football, it makes it that much more enjoyable but it's not an absolute necessity. <br />A nice bonus on the DVD is interviews with the players NOW. It's quite interseting to see how their lives unfolded 16 years after the events depicted in the film.<br />Perhaps my favourite aspect of the film is the soundtrack. It is by far the most searingly beautiful and soulful music I've ever heard in a movie. I bought the CD only 2 days after my 2nd viewing of the film. Most of the songs are performed by a Texas quartet called 'Explosions in the Sky'. Defininitely not the type of music you'd expect about a 'football' movie, but then this movie is less about football than about the emotions of the youngsters playing it and the incredible burden placed on them by an entire town. I simply can't say enough about it. Everyone who has heard this disc so far has remarked on it favourably.
B0002IU988|5.0|There is only one word to describe this album--excellent!  The departure of Scott Stapp from the band has actually made them better.  Gone are the sappy love songs along with the over-mellow voice.  The new lead singer, Myles Kennedy, is MUCH better!  His voice is a lot fuller, and he sings with passion and meaning.  Kennedy brings the songs to life vocally, and the great guitar riffs and percussion bring them to life musically.  The two best songs here are \\"Find the Real\\" and \\"Open Your Eyes\\", which have nothing to do about love but have everything to do about the human spirit and the things beyond this life.  This album is quite a rocker and quite enjoyable when you are in a \\"rock out\\" kind of mood.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is amazing. Green Day has really progressed and has almost done what Queensryche did in the past- concept albums.
B00005JNPZ|3.0|Will Smith will always be Will Smith in his movies. His personality is getting old to me, but thankfully Kevin James (the new John Candy) and Eva Mendes (she has the you can't take your eyes off her exotic look...smoking hot!) save this film. Most of the funny scenes are the ones you see in the previews and the funniest of them all is the second dance scene that happens right before the end credits. This is a great date film that most guys will enjoy too. A little happy-sappy in parts, but there is enough relationship humor to keep it interesting.
B000002MP2|5.0|You know what? I'm not going to tell you about how \\"Dookie\\" is brilliant, because it isn't particularly, and I'm not going to tell you how it revolutionized punk rock, because it didn't.  An album doesn't have to be revolutionary to be great.  \\"Dookie\\" is great simply because every song is good.  When I listen to the album, I never get the urge to skip over any songs.   <br /> <br />These guys put together a collection of terrific songs that any bored teenager can relate to -- and make no mistake, being bored early-twentysomethings when they made this, this is the record they meant to make.  From the apathy toward love in \\"When I Come Around\\" to the apathy toward life in \\"Burnout,\\" these are lyrics that, while not particularly profound, are so relateable it hurts.  As a teenager it is such a relief to be reminded that angst isn't the end of the world, there's always a way to get over it and even laugh at it. <br /> <br />That's what Green Day does for me personally -- they remind me to not take myself so seriously, there's always another facet of life if something doesn't work out.  And I know punk purists scoff at that, but I don't care.  Music doesn't have to be all thrashing guitars and feedback -- sometimes people are just in the mood to bounce and sing along.  And there's nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br />So, other than their personal impact on me, Green Day put together a fine album in \\"Dookie.\\"  The songs individually are good, but put together they flow so much better.  For instance, \\"Basket Case\\" was so overplayed that many people grew sick of it, but here in its natural environment I guarantee you it sounds just as fresh as when you first heard it. Other such overplayed singles that sound better are \\"Longview,\\" \\"She,\\" \\"Welcome to Paradise,\\" and possibly my favorite GD song ever, \\"When I Come Around.\\" Some of the standout tracks you may not have heard on the radio include \\"Burnout,\\" \\"Sassafras Roots,\\" and one of my top 3 on the album, \\"Pulling Teeth.\\"<br /> <br />Highly recommended, especially for those times when you just want to unwind.
0385512058|5.0|This book is fantastic.  I have read it several times and each time I do I become a bit more dilligent at putting into practice the suggestions from the book.  Keith speaks with such a personal and impactful style.  He speaks about a way of life; an approach that helps other people and yourself to become successful and more meaningful.  I realize that with effort this will aid you at achieving the most from all aspects of business and life.
B00002ND77|5.0|\\"Malcolm X\\" is an undeniably great film released in 1992 starring Denzel Washington (\\"Training Day\\") and Angela Bassett (\\"What's Love Got To Do With It\\").  This powerful film directed by Spike Lee (\\"Do the Right Thing\\") follows the life of the great and controversial civil rights leader Malcolm X.  It presents how he became as for he's most famous, his turbulances through childhood and into adulthood, his road to finding peace in the neighborhoods, and his leading to the Muslim religion.  The effects of racism in the US project themselves greatly, giving the film a more powerful theme.  Meanwhile, the passion and the struggle maintain their standing throughout, keeping audiences' attention through the entire three-hour film. <br /> <br />Though all the actors give great performances, Washington and Bassett's state themselves the strongest.  Washington, in his Oscar-nominated performance (Best Actor), portrays Malcolm X beautifully through his emotions and his charisma.  As in every film, he proves that he's one of few modern-day actors who has pure talent.  Bassett portrays Malcolm X's, wife marvelously.  This underrated actress acts out her character's life hardtimes like she's actually living them.  Such acting strengths from them give this film the extra powerful theme that it deserves. <br /> <br />Such film quality leads \\"Malcolm X\\" to a powerful and unforgettable conclusion.  This is sure to please many audiences for years ahead.  Though this film presents only three hours of Malcolm X's life, this offers a great perception of his life and his beliefs.
B000069AUI|3.0|I thought this album was great when I first heard it. Then I kept listing to it and I relize that all the songs sound like Clocks or The Scientist. I also I got sick of them when everyone were saying how great they are. But I have to thank those sissy's from Coldplay because of them I got into great music like Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Roxy Music, David Bowie, Echo and the Bunnymen and countless others that Coldpay have stolen from mercifully. One more thing they may have surpassed Radiohead in record sales and popularity but actually i think Radiohead is happy that they did. The are on the same record label so emi is presuring them to sell alot of cds, That means they are not preasuring Radiohead that much to come out with another ok computer. It gives the band alot more time to experiment even more. If you must buy this cd buy it used atleast that way the record label and the band would not get any money from the sell of the cd we all know that they have plenty of money. He has his own money and we all know that his wife was born with a silver spoon in her mouth and she gets paid to much for her movies most of them are forgotten very quickly even the one she won the oscar for. Chris why did you name your baby apple it is not enought that she has a sissy for a dad but now when she gets older kids at school are really going to tease her.
B0002EXH54|5.0|This album is what metal is all about. From begining to end, this album is a master piece. Some critics say that its not as good as Metallica's Master of Puppets or Slayer's Reign in Blood, then don't listen to them. It's better than Master of Puppets, but ties with Reign in Blood. The most famous bass beat is in this song, right at the begining of the song Peace Sells. It takes true talent to make an album like this, and Megadeth has done it effortlessly.
1400043662|1.0|I am really surprised that many English readers appreciate so much this ordinary book. I read this book in Japanese, and I am sure that its English translation must be marvelous, much better than its original. If you have enough time to spend for reading this long book, it is better for you to look for other authors, if Japanese, Kenzaburo Oe, Soseki Natsume, Shusaku Endo or Junichiro Tanizaki. Murakami used to be a good writer (\\"A Wild Sheep Chase,\\" \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World\\"), but now his works are simple garbage. Don't waste your time by reading such junk book.
B0000024JA|4.0|This is a heavy album by Meth released in 1994 around when all Wu members were doing solo joints. Raekwon's \\"only built 4 cuban linx' Gza 'Liquid Swords' Ghostface 'Ironman' and also Tical which is Meth's (in my opinion) only good album. At the moment he is releasing lazy sh-t which he could of banged up in a minute or two with no effort, his most recent album 'Tical 0 The Prequel' is a good example of that. His second album 'Tical 2000: Judgement day' is mediocre with some good stuff on it. But with this it is just dope.<br /><br />The production is by the RZA on every track here and he does his usual type of beats, grimey, kickdrum beats and suprisingly then isn't many Kung fu samples here, which are on every album. The lyrics are tight about 8/10 which is good but he ain't the greatest lyricist of the Wu tang.<br /><br />All the sonsg on here are at least good. the first two are ok 'Tical' and 'Biscuits' but it starts to get better with 'Bring the Pain' and better after that.<br /><br />My favorite songs on this album are: Bring the Pain, Mr Sandman, Meth vs Chef (feat Raekwon), Release yo delf and What The Blood Clot. Also check 'All I Need' and 'I get my thang in action' which are also tight.<br /><br />Overall this is a very good album but not 5 stars i would give the produciton 9/10 and the lyrics 8/10 which overall is probably 8.5/10 which is 4 stars.<br /><br />Buy if you wanna hear Meth before he got lazy and if you wanna hear a good album.<br /><br />And that's all I have to say about that.
B000023VR6|5.0|This cd is a Classic. Dre delivers some sick beats. I suggest you go out and get this album.
B0002858YS|2.0|The best songs on this album are the ones you hear on the radio all the time. The rest of the songs sound like bad versions of those songs. You be better off listening to bands like the Cure, the Smith, The Talking Heads, Echo and the Bunnymen or any other good new wave band then this bad imitation.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This album is near the top of great Mega-albums. The songs are awesome, I espeasially like Darkest Hour, which Dave wrote after Cliff Burton died. I all the songs are enjoyable. I love to listen to this album, and Into the Lungs of Hell is one of the best instrumental songs EVER!! <br />
6302814782|3.0|Just as Sissy Spacek carried \\"Carrie,\\" Corey Haim saves \\"The Lost Boys.\\"  I enjoyed his performance as younger brother Sam, and will be watching for more of his acting talent in future productions. <br />  <br />The boring beginning (crappy concert) would appeal to pre-teens, but once the fire-ball gets rolling, the humor is universal.  The Vampire House Rules change from one movie to the next, but since I am no aficianado, the half-vampire status in this flick does not faze me; it only adds to the fun. <br />  <br />My favorite scenes were the designer death extravaganzas of the staked bat-boys.  The two Vampire-Busters (the Frog brothers) delivered satisfying portrayals of kids pushing the limits of what they can handle.  They kept it real, enabling us to laugh at ourselves at that age.  <br />  <br />Although The Lost Boys is aimed at the pre-teen crowd, skillful scripting invites us moldy oldies to party along.  And we do. <br />
B0006J28KU|2.0|I would rarely take time and use up space on a single comment, but this seems worth it if it saves the consumer and fan a few bucks. \\"Heat\\" is a great movie, and I leave it to the elloquent reviews below to tell you that. Unfortunately, the previous reviewers were right, the DVD transfer on this special edition is nothing short of abyssmal.<br /><br />The sound transfer was completely botched. I have never heard the contrast between sound, soundtrack and dialog so poorly pared. The dialog is extremely quiet, while the noises (crashes, gunshots) are so loud they made my neighbors knock when I had turned it up to hear the dialog. The soundtrack is also relegated to basically ambient noise.<br /><br />How disappointing. Please consider this if you're thinking of buying this for a crisper presentation than the old no-feature cardboard box DVD version. The extras are certainly welcome, but the film is not given its proper appearance and little justice is hereby done. (Please don't give this review negative votes because of the 2-star rating, I am only rating the DVD quality.)
B00005JL3A|1.0|This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Firts off I love the Resident Evil video games. This movie did not have one character from the video game. Second off George A. Romero was going to write and direct this movie and was replaced by Paul Anderson(probably becasuse the mainstream movie audiences are flippin' idiots and don't know what a good horror film is). I read Romero's script and it had everything in the Resident Evil game. I hated that the zombies had CG faces. I hated the CG in this movie period. The plot was HORRIBLE. The acting was HORRIBLE. I left the theatre in disgust. Oh yeah, the last thing they had to kill in the movie was a \\"Licker\\". In Resident Evil 2 game you can kill a \\"Licker\\" with two shotguns blasts. In the movie they had the hardest time killing the \\"Licker\\". Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. I guess that's what you can expect with Paul Anderson. I refuse to watch Resident Evil 2. Long live Romero. Can't wait for Land of the Dead.
B000003TA2|5.0|Before Shirley Manson was singing about killing ex-lovers and being happy about the rain - even before PJ Harvey was writing lyrics about hating a man who'd impregnated her - an even darker woman was emerging onto the rock scene. Her name was Kim Gordon and we heard her roar. Her sultry voice is at its best on \\"Goo\\", Sonic Youth's weirdest - but perhaps most brilliant LP. <br /> <br />Sonic Youth is one of those bands people somehow forget about, and this is the album most magazines ashamedly forget about when they compile their annual \\"100 Best Records Ever\\" lists. Sonic Youth had a way of playing the muse for some of the most influential bands of the early 90's, including Nirvana, who would later express major gratitude to this band. <br /> <br />This album is harsh. It's not for people who aren't down to listen to grating guitars that aren't always in tune. But it's worth a listen even to people who aren't into that sort of sound - kinda like how you \\"have\\" to listen to the Beatles regardless of whether you're Jay-Z or Ryan Adams. Such people would probably be surprised to see the effect this band has had on countless others, ranging from Belle & Sebastian to New Found Glory. <br /> <br />Bottom line: \\"Goo\\" is a style of music in itself. You don't have to like it, you don't have to rave about, but you definitely have to listen to it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Breathe. It's over. Wow. <br />Ya' know, ya' hear em' all the time on hit radio from Dookie and other such albums all the time, but this was unexpected. <br />You heard it here for the hundreth time, folks! Someone has finally, perfectly, penned the feeling of the youth generation in America right now. And parents, if you want to be close to your sons or daughters, listen to this. This album falls along the lines of Nevermind, Disintegration, Born To Run, and Highway 61 in generational importance.  <br />This was supposed to be a rock opera-the term pended by The Who's Peter Townsend. By all definitions it achieved that status. Although American Idiot is not nearly ambitious as Tommy, it is perhaps just as good. Tommy contained an air of dryness that made the album sound like recycled Who songs. The feeling is mutual, as this album has the rotund feeling of recycled Green Day songs. This can be a test for an average listener. <br />Halfway through this album, you may require a break. Power chord after power chord can be redundant and painful for the ears. For this album to have truly been among the range of Tommy, Who's Next, and Patti Smith's Horses, softer melodies should have been used. <br />If you were to compare this to Nevermind, Billy Joe Armstrong does not have the screaming range of Curt Cobain, but he certainly has his own charm. Certainly, every song on here has its charm, and could be a radio hit. Keep in mind, any of these tracks would be considered a hit for any other band.  <br />Most importantly, this album sounds like what has been going on in my head for the longest time. But the last place I expected to find this was a burned out nineties band who as last I heard, were having kids, entering marriage, and tired of fart jokes and their twenties. Yet I am glad. <br />I must compare this to the most recent great albums out there: The Strokes' Room On Fire & Is This It?, The White Stripes' Elephant, The Beastie Boys' To The 5 Buroughs (A vastly underestimated album that should be considered one of their best, and of 2004) and Brian Wilson's Smile. American Idiot will probably forever be regarded as the greatest album of 2004. Although nobody even new it existed for a while in reference to the charts. It was a slow burner. <br />The \\"joyride\\" that was the election, should have made the common stories on this album indifferent. Instead, John Kerry's loss just fueled youth alienation further. This album is number one on the charts in many other countries. This of course is because it defies that ol' time \\"American Ignorance & Arrogance\\". Which is more understated then ever in this age of moral disgust (The Fox Network) and morons (Both of our fantastic presidential candidates). Most namely the nations of the U.K. and Japan. Understandably. <br />This album does not fall under the catagory of \\"Genius\\", but rather \\"Classic\\". Which is still Great. Rolling Stone magazine, who featured Green Day on their cover most recently, rated this album a little above GOOD. 3&1/2 stars. out of five. Not too good for a star chart.  <br />With all fairness, an album of this caliber, from song to song, should have been given 5 stars or 4. Their three and a half stars was like an editing mistake. I am surprised they didn't apoligize and correct it in the following issue.  <br />In weak summation, a great idea that could have been better if Billy Joe had a better vocal range, more than those overused power chords, but the same great writing ability. <br />If you want to hear \\"Our Generation's Album\\", then listen to Green Day. But if you want the best album is the past five years, listen to the White Stripes' ELEPHANT. Or, if you want to hear the best punk-anti-establishment recording ever, listen to The Clash LONDON CALLING, the best album ever. Especially for the young ones. <br />\\"I just remembered a what I said about Green Day the first time I heard them in 2000 (I'm 17),\\" said an older me, \\"Too many power chords, and the singer is annoying,\\" OH SHUT UP! <br />
6305878323|5.0|Mary Poppins was unquestionably Walt Disney's greatest achievement during his lifetime. The thought of making a full-length musical movie based on the P.L. Travers novel with an all-star cast, completely filmed on a Hollywood sound stage about a story set in London is in itself mind boggling, but Director Robert Stevenson managed to make it happen. The film was Julie Andrews' first film and earned for her her first Academy Award in a story that was almost a scandal in Hollywood that year; she had been the one to create the role of Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady on Broadway, but that same year, My Fair Lady was released with Audrey Hepburn in the lead, so most of the film industry -- and Julie Andrews herself -- saw the Oscar as a way of apologizing for the slight. However, her performance in the film was, as was Mary Poppins, \\"practically perfect in every way.\\" <br /> <br />Appearing with her is Dick Van Dyke, the only non-Brit in the cast who none the less gives an excellent performance in the roles of Bert and as Mr. Dawes, Sr. David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns star as George and Winifred Banks, parents to Jane and Michael Banks, played by Karen Dotrice and Michael Garber. The star-studded cast also includes Hermione Baddeley, Reta Shaw, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher, Ed Wynn, Arthur Malet, and Jane Darwell. <br /> <br />The musical score by Robert Sherman is outstanding. The songs include \\"Chim Chim Cheree\\" (which won an Academy Award), \\"A Spoonful of Sugar,\\" \\"Feed the Birds,\\" \\"I Love to Laugh,\\" and the song that introduced a new word into the lexicon of moviegoers everywhere, \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\\" <br /> <br />The film is a riot of special effects, real-life characters in animated settings, and musical and dance sequences that make the film worthy of the label \\"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" without question. Mary Poppins the film, like the nanny Mary Poppins herself, is \\"practically perfect in every way.\\"
B00061QJZI|4.0|i enjoyed will ferrel's 'anchorman' to a certain extent so i will begin to review it. Burgundy was always hilarious, if at times a little weird - take the scene where he was speaking to baxter, his dog, for proof on that statement. there were also a few notable quotes in this movie, and the guy who kept getting his arms chopped off was a good gag. anyone who watched the movie knows that the gag before him & veronica before they went out was hilarious (but I won't mention what it is because amazon may edit it.) and brick's idiocy was also funny. <br />\\"where'd you get those, the, toilet store?\\" <br /> <br />however the fight between veronica and ron was a bit too long; and everything seemed just fine between them right after that. however i hope you enjoy this. here's hoping.

B000069KGM|5.0|I was a Chicago fan even before I saw them in concert in 1969, 3rd row seats! <br /> <br />I probably had not listened to this collection since I heard it on my record player (probably at least 20 years ago, if not more).  <br /> <br />Anyhow, I was happily surprised when I heard it again on cd today, it took me back right there again. The beautiful trumpets, killer guitar riffs and piano sounded as good or better than I remembered. The words and the voices all as vivid as ever. <br /> <br />Every song on this set is a gem, absolutely 100% Chicago! <br /> <br />Whether you are a fan or simply want to hear what really well written, feel good, fully orchestrated, syncopated music USED to sound like, you really need to get this cd. The talent in the group is legendary. <br /> <br />I ordered this one and the Chicago silver album (a 25 song cd!) and can't bellieve I waited this long to get this on cd. <br /> <br />excellent
B000001A9P|5.0|For those of us that live in the \\"boondocks\\" where artists rarely or never appear, \\"live\\" recordings provide us with the stadium or concert hall experience.<br /><br />\\"Natural Wonder,\\" recorded in both Israel and Japan is, as the title implies, a stupendous performance by one of the 20th century's true geniuses.  Backed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra and a band featuring instrumental heavyweights Nathan Watts, Darryl Jackson, along with others, the Motown legend delivers with an intensity that makes him the envy of his contemporaries and his successors.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Dancing to the Rhythm,\\" a highly charged tune that has Wonder's mellifluous vocal instrument matched by an outstanding Paul Riser string arrangement.  This song, along with \\"Stevie Ray Blues,\\" and \\"Mr. and Mrs. Little Ones, are previously unreleased tunes but they meld seamlessly with his more familiar hits.<br /><br />And what hits they are!!!<br /><br />The Academy Award-winning \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\".  The pop/R & B smashes \\"My Cherie Amour,\\" \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours,\\" \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life,\\" and so many others.<br /><br />One would have to be six feet under to not be moved by \\"Rocket Love\\" or \\"I Wish\\".<br /><br />The album may be ten years old but Wonder's music is timeless, still resonating with soulful passion as they did when they were first heard.<br /><br />And that makes Stevie one for the ages!

B0007TKNL0|5.0|The irony:  High-paid movie critics bashing the motion picture Phantom of the Opera, while the viewers have given it high acclaims.  Why are these guys paid again? <br />Let me start of by saying... that no one, and I mean NO ONE can \\"swoop\\" a cape like Gerard Butler. With that said... here is my official review of the motion picture: <br />While I understand why many have baulked at the movie version of Phantom of the Opera because they have been raised & succored with only the Broadway play, I would have to disagree with those who have ostracized the film.  I know the Broadway play had elements that were essential in creating the perfect atmosphere on the stage for Phantom of the Opera...some of which, the motion picture omitted.  However, there was a higher ratio of elements that the motion picture brought to life, that the play was incapable of creating, and never could have the capability of simulating.  The cinematography for the film alone set a mood that was untouchable.  <br />Movies these days are just a bunch of fluff, comedic relief, T & A and absent plots.  It is rare that a movie comes to the screen and leaves an infinite impression in the viewer's mind.  Finally, someone had the nards to stand up, rebel against cinematic-conformity and create a musical of a beloved and well-known Broadway play.  Is this dangerous?   Yes... but highly applaudable!  And not only did Andrew L. W. and Joel S. have the fortitude to bring this recreation to the big screen, but they made it ASTONISHING!   The music, the cast, the cinematography, the suspense, the emotion, the theatrical elements, the similarity between the play and the film, and the overall look and feel of the movie was Tres Chic!! <br />And when it comes to the countless times I have read media and individual reviews rebuking Gerard Butler's ability to sing... again, I would have to disagree because I was impressed.  Sure, he is not one of the Three Tenors, or even the original \\"Stage Phantom\\" for that matter.  With that said, neither is anyone else in the \\"Film\\" from the original \\"Broadway Stage Cast\\"... because this was a FILM... there is a vast difference between the two.  No `one' person can take the place of another in any situation.  I was proud of Gerard B. for having the courage to accept a role that required him to sing, when he had no musical background.  And from what I saw and heard... he rose above his challenges.  What he lacked in musical ability, he made up in his acting.  He was the perfect phantom!  <br />I am recommending this movie to everyone!  I recommend attending without previously reading ANY reviews.  It is common knowledge that humans are lemmings... we conform to what a majority is saying or doing.  Be a free thinker, don't let ANY review tell you how to like or hate a movie.  Don't let some stiff-necked movie critic, with a bad comb-over, tell you how to feel about something... go out and see it yourself.  Decide as an individual, be a critical thinker.  Think for yourself, and enjoy... or don't... and if you don't like it... no worries... because it leaves a seat open for me at the movies.  I give this movie a: BRAVO!!!  BELLE!!!  and   \\"PHANTastic\\"!!! <br />
B0006IIPIK|2.0|The director of this movie apparently wanted to create something that reminded us about the old Science Fiction theater days.  However, all it did was remind me of why people don't make movies like this and why Science Fiction Theater 3000 got many laughs from an implausible plot and horrible acting.  The sad thing is... this seemed intentional. <br /> <br />If you are looking for something different from today's science fiction, this might be for you.  If you are looking to see what science fiction used to look at, you might like to take a peak at this.  If you tend to like the direction science fiction is headed and don't want to look back, skip this movie. <br /> <br />I fit the in the last category and wish I hadn't wasted money on this rental or the time invested to sit through it all.
B00006JSS8|4.0|Perhaps, this should've been entitled \\"A Collection of WONDERful Hits\\" for this is far short of a \\"definitive\\" compilation.  The edited \\"Do I Do\\" is certainly a letdown.<br /><br />However, for one that is looking for a small sampling of the legend's music, then this will fare until one can afford to buy the more superlative four-disc \\"At the Close of the Century\\".

6305363668|2.0|This movie is good if you have nothing better to do than sit at home and watch TV. I read the book (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) and loved it. I thought the video was 'dumbed-down' far to much and lost all origional meaning. Just sex and violence with no moral. Don't get me wrong, sex and violence is great entertainment, but it shouldn't be used to butcher a excellent novel. READ THE BOOK!!!
B0002S947K|4.0|Bluesy folk delivered with a great, gravelly voice.  This is so good, you will forgive the \\"growing pains\\" Lamontagne displays, like his foray into social commentary on \\"How Come\\" which is heavy on the high school poetry rhetoric...just move right over those immature generalities and along to the heart-wrenching \\"Jolene,\\" which plays out the confession of a junkie to his love that he's convinced he is beyond redemption, to get a taste of what is to come as Lamontagne matures and hones his craft to match that amazing voice...

B0006399FS|1.0|U2 has never written so pathetic and hypocritical stuff.  <br /> <br />Many mainstreamer U2 fans will tell you that you need to listen to this album several times before 'it grows on you'. Well, fungus can grow on you too but that's not very pleasant either. Any good song worth its salt will catch your attention right away; the more you listen to it, the more you enjoy it.  <br /> <br />That's not the case with How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb as the more we listen to it, the less we like it. The fan base just do in that way. Just read the first 150 reviews, a lot of 5 stars and almost no 1-2 stars. If this album were 'grows on you', it would be obvious finding a lot of 1-2 stars at the first hundred of reviews and a lot of 5 stars now. That's not the case, rather, you find a lot of 1 stars reviews in recent weeks. <br /> <br />This pseudo-music is the final proof that U2 are completely sellouts and finished as relevant band. <br />It's almost as if a group of marketing executives got together and plugged and chugged their top 40 formula.  <br />U2 are just interested in being an icon and not a band that deliver art (which are two very different things). What a sellout.  <br /> <br />PS: Do you remember the words?... No More... sing No More... <br />
B000002KB8|5.0|Black Sabbath's debut album would introduce the world to one of heavy metal's greatest bands. Led by Tony Iommi's signature guitar riffs and Ozzy Osbourne's distinctive vocals, the band created a sound that was truly their own. They would also become the most influential band in their genre as their music not only paved the way for British metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest but also provided a blueprint for the grunge bands of the '90s and much of the heavy metal being recorded today.<br /><br />The title track is anchored by the first of what would be many slow yet memorable guitar riffs that Iommi would compose. What truly carries the song though are Ozzy's vocals in which he sounds downright suicidal, especially when he screams \\"Oh No! No! Please God help me!\\" \\"The Wizard\\" is also a great track featuring Ozzy's blaring harmonica and some chaotic drumming from Bill Ward. The track \\"N.I.B.\\" is one of their most enduring songs and features another cool heavy riff and the dark lyrics that the band became famous or infamous for. The tracks \\"Behind The Wall Of Sleep\\" and \\"Wicked World\\" are also strong tracks and feature more of those great slow riffs and some busy bass playing from Geezer Butler. The album closes strong with \\"Sleeping Village\\" and the 11-minute blues jam called \\"Warning\\" and while the latter is not the most musically impressive tune you'll hear, it's the ominous mood and feel that make it great. Overall, this is a very strong debut and certainly one of their best albums. Highly recommended.
B000002KNY|5.0|Just like with a lot of Talking Heads albums- the first time a i listened to Fear of Music I was a little freaked out by the candid lyrics, the ominous (in minor chord structure) sound of Fear of Music- it's not just a brilliant album in general, but for something created in a sweaty loft next to a sweatshop in New York i think it's absoloutely marvellous! I Zimbra is the perfect opening track- and the first taste of Talking Heads future works. Mind, Paper, Cities, Air, Animals, Electric Guitar and Drugs are the more intriguing tracks (and by this i mean listen to them 3 times before you either a, like them or b, understand them) Memories Can't Wait is probably Talking Heads' darkest song- Life During Wartime was percieved as somewhat of a Novelty hit in it's time, but it makes (just like all of Talking Heads' music) more sense today then when it was recorded. and finally Heaven, with its transition between standard and minor chords and it's suggestive lyrics- Its one of the best songs on the album.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I bought this workout when it first came out. I saw a change in one month I lost 30 pounds. I was satified with my results. I feel inspired to workout with the video. I know lots of friends who have barrowed the video and seen the results as well. I wasn't trying to \\"look\\" like her but wanted to lose weight and look fit. The music kept you going. Its almost like you move to the music. It makes working out fun. <br />The short workout is great if you are in a hurry or just want to maintain the weight and your physical apperence.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Having read most of the reviews of Dream Theatre's Train Of Thought, I am struck by the hidebound nature of some of the criticism.  If Dream Theater decided to keep making the same kind of music over and over again, without evolving or experimenting with different approaches, they would be a lounge act, not the progressive musical outfit that they are.  There are a lot of people who want DT to make Images and Words or Scenes From A Memory for the rest of their career, and reject anything that deviates from those paths.  Progressive rock is about evolution. Without it, great music is not created. If DT had not evolved, they would not have produced the great work that they have.   <br /> <br />That said, Train Of Thought is good work.  There is more headbanging riffage than there is in most DT opuses, but that's not neccessarily a bad thing.  The musicianship is still there, it's just a LITTLE less excessive, and is rendered in (somewhat) more easily digestible portions.  Less ornate DT is still better than most of what passes for heavy metal nowadays.  I liked this.  The songs are strong, the playing is direct and visceral.  There is a lot to like.  Endless Sacrifice, Vacant, Stream Of Consciousness, and In The Name Of God are great songs.  Musical genres cease to become intersting when their practitioners cease to evolve and experiment. If you want predictable, there is plenty of that out there.  If you want great musicians who are going to push their boundaries, DT is for you.  Like a previous reviewer stated, the alternative is worse.
B0000BWTK3|1.0|I'm sorry; this is boring. Not very interesting for pianists to listen to... Andsnes has this cold, polished and impersonal style. His playing is predictable and when a phrase is repeated it sounds just the same. It seems like he doesn't care what he is playing. The most important thing is to show off this utterly \\"perfect\\" form - this musical emperor's new clothes. Nice and streamlined playing has little to do with great performance. I would prefer listening to Vladimir Horowitz, Grigory Sokolov or Martha Argerich. The Norwegian pianst Einar Steen Nokleberg is a much better interpreter of Grieg.
B000294SFW|4.0|Call this what you want--punk, punk metal, speed metal, groove metal, or just good ol' fashioned heavy metal done right. Whatever it is, it's a dang fine listen. \\"Inferno\\" is Motorhead's finest album since they made \\"Ace of Spades\\" in the '70's. They're just as inspired and exciting here as they were when they made \\"Ace of Spades\\". As Blender magazine said, \\" a fragrant chunk of superloud rhythm and roar\\".<br />Most of these songs are pretty repetitive (just one riff running throughtout the whole song, plus a guitar solo or two.)But the riffs are meaty, speedy, and dang catchy and the guitar solos are usually really good, too. In addition, Lemmy's voice and lyrics are gruff but catchy.<br /><br />\\"The Terminal Show\\" shoots out of the gate. From the first to the last second, this song is sheer excitement. The riff is so propulsive and fast, it kind of makes this song sound like a Slayer tune. Plus, the guitar solo, which lasts 25 seconds, is wild.<br />\\"Down on Me\\" has a guitar riff which goes up and down throughout the song (making a \\"ner nah ner\\" sound), but the two guitar solos, which are whiney and even a bit shrieky, drag this song down a bit.<br />\\"In the Black\\" has chug-chug riffing with two more shredding guitar solos. One of the guitar solos is a wailing one, the other makes a \\"wah wah\\" sound in places.<br />\\"Fight\\" opens with a lumbering riff, then turns to a fast chug, while Lemmy sings \\"Fight! Fight! Right...fight!\\"<br />The last track, \\"Whorehoues Blues\\", is indeed a bluesy, acoustic track which sort of sounds like a Johnny Cash song, (except it has a harmonica...and Lemmy is singing about, um, call girls.) I found myself tapping my foot to this song.<br /><br />The bottom line is, \\"Inferno\\" is the sound of Motorhead at the top of their game. If you wonder what it was like listening to Motorhead for the first time back in the '70's, pick this C.D. up, you will not be disappointed.
0385513755|5.0|This piece was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Since I go to school and barely have time to read, when I do, I get so engrossed in it that I find myself reading at rapid paces and unable to put the book down. Dan Brown has done a fantastic job on this book. It's fun, very well thought out, creative, imagininative but most of all, suprisingly, sometimes accurate. That little fun fact mentioned somewhere in the book about Friday the 13th and why it is believed to be so unlucky is very interesting. That was news to me! There aren't enough words to describe this book. The movie, I hope, will be great.<br /><br />As I would say, \\"Te la comiste, Dan!\\"<br /><br />Louis

It's about a poor family and their lives, how they form bonds and their sense of togetherness.  Francie is beautiful character and her interactions with all her family members are wonderfully written.  Oh, and the ending: I cried.  It's just so beautiful.  Gawd, I loved this book.

B000000H3Z|5.0|1989's \\"Beneath the Remains\\" marked a breakthrough for Sepultura.  Don't let the acoustic intro of the opening title track fool you, \\"Beneath the Remains\\" is one of the absolute greatest death/thrash metal albums of all time, and remains the best album to come from Sepultura to this day.  Max Cavalera's furious howls are enough to make your ears bleed, Igor Cavalera's thunderous double bass drumming is among the best to be heard in the genre, and guitarist Andreas Kisser's blistering solo work on \\"Slaves of Pain\\", \\"Sarcastic Existence\\", and \\"Mass Hypnosis\\" are nothing short of brilliant.  There's not a single filler track to be heard on \\"Beneath the Remains\\", justifying it's reputation as an all time classic.  This is the real deal, nothing Max ever conjured up in Soulfly could even compare to this, and the many bands populating the new \\"metalcore\\" scene today should give this a listen to hear how death/thrash/metal is really done.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I'd like to start off by saying that I love the Clash.  I don't really care to get involved in the whole \\"Is the Clash really punk or not?\\" battle, but they are really great rock.  This album was released seven years before I was born and I only got into it this year.  It's really great to listen to it after being bombarded with the generally expoited, crappy punk of my generation (Good Charlotte, The Casualties).  Give this CD a listen and if you're a music fan at all you'll find something you can appreciate.
B0002OERI0|5.0|1st listen of the album didnt exactly get me hooked. But with subsequent listens, i gradually grew to like this one a lot, n i don't even have any of the band's past cds. This album rocks with catchy tunes like 'Holiday' and 'Letterbomb', though i dont exactly like 'American idiot'. Green day hv absolutely proved they havent faded over the years; in fact they're sounding deeper and more mature with this one here. My personal ratings for each of the songs: <br /> <br />1) American Idiot 7/10 catchy but not impressive <br />2) Jesus of Suburbia 9/10 superb long song with super catchy tunes <br />3) Holiday 10/10 almost my fave on this album. love e rap part to death. extremely catchy and fun track. n the drums rock for this one. <br />4) Boulevard of Broken Dreams 9/10 i love this track e 1st time i heard it, but think i got too sick of it after hearing it for too long... but still, deep n great song <br />5) Are we the waiting 8/10 a lil bit boring 4 me. but still a pretty nice moderately slow song <br />6) St Jimmy 7/10 personally dont really like this 1 <br />7) Give me Novacaine 9/10 impressive one. <br />8) Shes a Rebel 8/10 a bit too punk-pop for me. but catchy though <br />9) Extraodinary Girl 8/10 similar to Shes a rebel but nicer sounding. surprised that these tracks followed one another which isnt exactly good cos they sound similar <br />10) Letterbomb 10/10 another one of my faves. best song on e album. extremely catchy melodies. <br />11) Wake me up when sep ends 9/10 great slow rock song. <br />12) Homecoming 8/10 not too bad! <br />13) Whatsername 10/10 another fab track to round up the entire album
B0006GAOBI|4.0|I saw the Director's Version in theaters last year, after reading an article in the paper that the original theatrical film became a \\"cult hit\\" on dvd after disappearing in theaters in 2001.  I had never heard of the film before (all I remember was a film called \\"Donnie Brasco\\" with Johnny Depp and had no interest in seeing that one), which is a shame because this film had the poor sense of timing (no fault of Director Richard Kelly) to be released in the month following the 9/11 tragedy, even though it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival many months earlier.  Had it opened in July or August of 2001, it might have become an even bigger financial success, which it certainly deserves.    When I watched the original theatrical version before seeing the Director's version, I didn't know what to make of this film.  Its a strange film that doesn't follow any linear pattern or conventional storyline, but it grabs your attention nonetheless with the awesome visuals, superb acting by a first rate cast, and has many funny moments punctuated by memorable, quotable lines.  This film, more than most I've seen, leaves a lasting impression after a first viewing.  While many films are instantly forgettable, this one stands above others with its unique vision and overall message.    What I love about this version over the original one are the inclusion of previously deleted scenes that should never have been deleted in the first place (and it was the studio obsessed with keeping the running time under two hours that demanded cuts).  The added scenes fill in some of the holes of the story, in particular, the scene where the father gives Donnie some good advice about being true to himself in spite of what others might think.  Its a funny moment, and a memorable one between father and son.  I also loved the scene where Drew Barrymore tells Donnie that maybe he and the Bunny can read \\"Watership Down\\" together.  That's a funny line that should never have been cut from the theatricalrelease.    What makes this film most memorable for me, where the director more than earned his right to direct future films, is the awesome scene when Tears for Fears \\"Head Over Heels\\" plays and we see a shortened, film-within-a-film, as all the elements of the overall film flow quite well with the music.  Its far better than most music videos I've seen and if they ever gave an Academy Award for best scene in a motion picture, that scene deserves the Oscar.  I also love the haunting melody and images of people grieving when \\"Mad World\\" plays.  An appropriately brilliant song, as are most song selections for this film.  The Sparkle Motion dance sequence was another memorable scene in the film particularly the way Drew Barrymore moves her eyes and head to the rhythms of Duran Duran's \\"Notorious\\", while still maintaining the blank stare of complete boredom.  Its hard to pull of something like that, but Drew does it perfectly.  Another brilliantly shot scene is when Jake Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone walk down the stairs in perfect synchronicity with each other.  The only change I didn't like from the original is that I thought \\"Under the Milky Way\\" fit much better with that sequence and the house party scene than the Echo and the Bunnymen song...but that's the only change I didn't like.    All in all, this film must be seen to be believed, and its complex enough to keep you wanting to watch it over and over, but also engagin enough to pull you into its mystery on first viewing.  This film could be a metaphor for many things and is worthy of a film discussion group.  The images of many scenes are beautifully crafted, well acted, and perfectly touched with the right music.  Director Richard Kelly has every reason to be proud of this notable achievement.  I can't wait to see what he will do with his next film, whenever that comes out.    One of the special features has a documentary by the supposed #1 Donnie Darko fan, which I found to be quite disturbing, especially at thevery end.  That Director Richard Kelly would allow such a documentary to be included on his director's version dvd says a lot about him as a person (a nice guy, in other words).  Fans who are wanting him to write a complete book on time travel to fill out this Donnie Darko project are asking too much.  Let the director move on to other projects, bringing his unique vision to the screen.  As great as this film may be...its still just a movie and the Time Travel book was only a prop that doesn't deserve more attention than it has already gotten.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|I don't quite get what is so good about Avril Lavigne.  Cause she's certainly not anywhere near good rock music.  And as for female rock musicians she stalls far behind the likes of Sheryl Crow.  So is she just better than the average pop musician?  And what's with her \\"punk\\" image.  She's not punk at all, but it seems to be so wrapped up in her music that it taints it.  Her music just isn't very good...so why does it pass?
B0006J28KU|5.0|I'd not describe the movie itself, assuming everyone knows it or can easily discover everything about it.<br />As for this special edition, the technical quality of the dvd is very high - which is so important in a movie like this, based not only on story and characters, but also on photograpy, sound and movie score.<br />There is a feature-long commentary track by Mann himself, talking about actors, locations, the developing of the movie and so on...<br />The 11 deleted scenes are mildly interesting and can reveal something more about the characters.<br />There are also 3 behind-the-scenes documentaries, revealing some information about the realization of the movie, the true-crime Mann based his characters on and also some facts about the famous meeting between De Niro and Pacino. In the last documentary, two of the movie crew take us to visit some of the Los Angeles location used during filming, as they are now, ten years later. Remembrance of the movie shooting days follows.<br />There are also three trailers, if you are interested.<br />Personally, I'd have liked to have more, but maybe it's just my lust for everything about this movie.<br />However a must-have dvd both - for the many fans of the film and for everyone who loves crime movies or good cinema.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I had an opportunity to finally watch Lost in Translation last weekend. The movie came out in 2003, in the fall, and I remember many folks treating it as a big deal at the time. Well, I did enjoy the movie, but not in that \\"big deal\\" way. It's an artsy movie that I would best classify as a set piece. You could go with the \\"often brilliantly executed artistic or literary work characterized by a formal pattern\\" definition, or the \\"situation, activity, or speech planned beforehand and carried out according to a prescribed pattern or formula\\" definition...either way, \\"set piece\\" is an accurate description of a movie which is so dependent on character and setting, and not so much on plot. Tokyo acts as a crucible by which Bob and Charlotte get to know each other, and they each experience epiphanies as to the nature of their current relationships, but in the end nothing in either of the lives truly changes. Their time together is sweet, and it is nice to watch their relationship grow, and you are left with the impression that they \\"will always have Tokyo\\".<br /><br />The movie reminded me a bit of the work of James Joyce. I know many are big fans of his work, but others, like myself, consider Joyce to be the \\"Catastrophe of 20th Century Literature\\". I would characterize his work the same way I characterize this movie: set pieces, with plot subsumed beneath character and setting, with epiphanies replacing climax and with little in the way of thematic structure and thrust. Don't get me wrong, I'm not equating the movie to Joyce...I'm just trying to illustrate my meaning.<br /><br />Bill Murray turns in a good performance...a believable portrayal of an aging actor. Scarlett Johannson does a good job as well. However, neither actor has to stretch in their roles...that's not the point of this style of movie. Bill Murray's best work, in my opinion, still has to be Groundhog Day. The movie was shot on location in Tokyo, and I recognized many places I'd passed through on my trips to that city.<br /><br />So, it's an enjoyable movie, but I guess I'm a bigger fan of more plot-driven movies, with a climax to the story. Likely worth a rental.rips to that city. <br /> <br />So, it's an enjoyable movie, but I guess I'm a bigger fan of more plot-driven movies, with a climax to the story. Likely worth a rental. <br />
B0006SSOHC|5.0|this is a great horror flick despite what people's expectations are. i guess i am getting tired of all these cgi monsters and special effects because when i seen this movie, it brought a sense of stomache turning that i haven't had in a horror movie in a while.<br /><br />first off, it isn't lacking in the se7en-style gore which was a plus in my books. of course there are the twists in this flick, but that isn't what caught my attention. it was the lack of computer tricks. some of the plot is somewhat unrealistic or unclear, but who cares. i typically don't go see horror movies to make sure that the entire movie runs flawlessly. i go to see these movies for their shock value and that is why i give this movie five stars.
B00004RJEG|5.0|It has taken awhile for The Corrs astonishing \\"Unplugged\\" performance to make it onto DVD in NTSC format but finally, the wait is over!!<br />Captured live in October 1999 before a studio audience in Ireland's Ardmore Studios, The Corrs deliver an outstanding up-close-and-personal performance in a small intimate setting. In addition to what was then their current hits, The Corrs also debut two songs from their album \\"In Blue\\" (\\"Radio\\" and \\"At Your Side\\") which are arguably superior than what would wind up on that studio album one year later.<br />Additionally, the band throws in some stellar renditions of traditional Irish tunes which show off the full scope of their musicianship as well as cover versions of their favorite songs - R.E.M.'s \\"Everybody Hurts\\", Fleetwood Mac's \\"Dreams\\", Jimi Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\" and Thin Lizzy's \\"Old Town\\" - which are played in a way that only The Corrs can play them.<br />A genuine highlight of the entire performance would have to be the cover version of Jimmy McCarthy's \\"No Frontiers\\" in which Andrea Corr leaves the stage giving the vocal spotlight over to sisters Sharon and Caroline who give a stirring heartfelt performance here.<br />Definitely, this DVD was well worth the wait. This is arguably The Corrs best performance on video. Andrea's voice is strong and powerful throughout, Sharon's violin and vocal harmonies are flawless while Caroline and Jim show off amazing versitility by switching between different instruments during the show (Caroline plays drums, bodhran, percussion and piano, Jim switches between many guitars as well as piano). The band's strong back up from Anthony Drennan, Keith Duffy, Mitchell Froom and the Irish Symphonic Film Orchestra give the performance an even bigger boost.<br />Despite having a rather expensive price-tag, \\"The Corrs Unplugged\\" is worth every dollar and penny. It's a great companion to the CD and shows The Corrs at their very very best.<br />A Must Have For All Corrs Fans!!
B0002DKCMG|5.0|i laughed so hard at this movie. there were so many jokes and little things that i didn't even notice the first time i watched it that it made it just as enjoyable the second time around. everything from the \\"scotty doesn't know\\" song to the absynth fairy to the crazy freaky guy they met on the train made me laugh. i personally think this is one of the best comedies i have seen. this is right up there with half baked and friday, the couple of comedies i can watch over and over.<br /><br />of course if you dislike offensive 'toilet' humor, stay away from this movie. if you are easily offended, you probably won't enjoy any part of this flick. but if you appreciate a comedy that pushes the envelope, this movie is for you. prime example, 2 people having sex in a confession booth, are you offended or not? that is what to expect.
0385510454|1.0|I have read all of Grisham's novels and this one is probably the worst of the lot.  There is too much of Italy in it and too little plot.  The story is not fleshed out and there are cardboard characters in it.   <br /> <br />There is a great deal of detail of the program which led to Backman's downfall and even more of all the possible assassins, but the book winds up too fast after meandering all over.  Whatever happens to the assassins like Sam Tin, only Grisham knows.   <br /> <br />I really wonder how the book was edited, because it is finally the editor's responsiblity to see that all the book presents a coherent picture, which it does not.

Fast forward to 2005 and if you are up to date with the times today (2/05) with all the remakes they are doing, this one also should me remade. <br />How about Jack White and Loretta Lynn. They showed they had good chemistry on her last album and I would love them to be the new Harold and Maude.

Soon she discovers though, that her moment away may cost her everything, for when she returns, she is left with nothing but a fork in the road. Armed only with a walkman, and her nine-year-old ingenuity, Trisha treks though the dense woods and swamps surrounding the Appalachian trail.  While police search for a reputed killer, and fear the worst, Trisha wanders alone, stalked by a supernatural predator that is far too real.<br /><br />King beautifully illustrates the fine line between reality and imagination in an exausted child's journey, and her fear and desperation nearly become our own.  This book is as heartwarming as it is terrifying, and after reading it, I find myself coming home to hold my little ones extra tight.
B00004T8RK|5.0|After a fantastic album like \\"Yield\\", I was somewhat hoping for and expecting something in the same vein. But I forgot that Pearl Jam will never repeat any album, no matter how good it may be. Which is what makes them such an awesome band to listen to. But when I first listened to \\"Binaural\\", I have to admit that I was not crazy about it. Perhaps it's because I was going through a real depressing and lame time of my life at the time- I don't know. The songs just seemed to totally match the way I felt at the time, which wasn't all that good. But being a COMPLETE Pearl Jam fanatic, I was faithful and gave this album several listens. But I was still not getting it due to the rut I was in. A year later, I moved to a different state and started driving truck again and my life really cheered up. It was then that I gave this album another chance. Gradually I began getting it- it began growing on me more and more with every listen and I all of a sudden fell in love with it. Able to not associate it with a dreary chapter in my life, for once I was actually able to see the true beauty of \\"Binaural\\". That compounded with seeing many of the tracks LIVE on the DVD \\"Pearl Jam: Touring Band 2000\\" really sold me to this incredible album. For the life of me I couldn't understand what I didn't like about it at first. Sure, it's different from \\"Yield\\", but it's SUPPOSED TO BE! That's what Pearl Jam is all about, and it's different in a VERY GOOD way. It's very dark and moody for a Pearl Jam album, but it works very well at the same time. It's got a really \\"atmospheric\\" sound and feel to it which I have grown to love. It's almost like the kind of music you'd expect to hear while hanging out in outer-space looking out at the Hourglass Nebula encircling a dying star, the exact image of the incredible album cover! But don't get me wrong- there are plenty of hard rockers on the album as well that seem to fit in PERFECTLY with the rest of the batch. The only filler on the ENTIRE album is \\"Soon Forget\\", and it's actually not that bad for filler. \\"Evacuation\\" takes quite a while to get into, it was the last song that finally started to grow on me. But once you get it, you get it. The album's hard rockers are \\"Breakerfall\\", \\"God's Dice\\" (What a name!), \\"Evacuation\\", \\"Grievance\\" (Another one that takes a few listens to appreciate, but once you do, you love it), and \\"Rival\\" (kind of reminded me of \\"No Way\\" off \\"Yield\\", same over-all raw vibe and good sound). All the rest of the tracks are EXCEPTIONAL slower tracks that are VERY deep and entrancing, as well as VERY beautiful. Stand-outs are the unbelievable radio hit, \\"Nothing As It Seems\\", \\"Of The Girl\\", \\"Sleight Of Hand\\" (one of my favorites off the album- sounds really atmospheric) and the ultimate album closer, \\"Parting Ways\\" (in which Eddie ends the album by singing, \\"drifting away...drifting away...\\" over and over). This has got to be my third most favorite Pearl Jam album of all time. Very good stuff from beginning to end- it's a real journey once you realize it's beauty and quality. But be prepared- it IS a darker sounding album, and because of that you might not like it at first. But trust me- give it a few listens and your jaw will soon drop in appreciation for a truly powerful album. Don't be like me and expect another \\"Yield\\" or any other album you may have liked- this one's different. But that's what makes it so entrancingly fantastic- it's very unique. Buy \\"Binaural\\" and give it a chance- you'll be happy you did.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|SLIPKNOT IS AWSOME! \\"PULSE OF THE MAGGOTS\\" AND \\"DUALITY\\" ARE AWSOME SONGS. YOU BETTER LOVE THEM.
B000002BYD|5.0|After a very impressive \\"No Code\\", Pearl Jam belted out their 5th and perhaps most potent album to that point. It has less experimentation you hear on \\"Vitalogy\\" and \\"No Code\\" and has a more straight ahead ROCK sound to it much like \\"Vs\\". And some of the tracks seem to have a hint of \\"Ten\\" in them, and that alone is reason enough to give this album a listen. In fact, when \\"Yield\\" first came out, I instantly fell in love with it, and it was easily my second most favorite Pearl Jam album; \\"Ten\\" being my first. It has a very refreshing and over-all up-beat sound to it. I drove truck when this came out and it's all I listened to- like \\"Ten\\" when it first came out, I just couldn't get enough of \\"Yield\\". The beauty of the album cover alone tells you that you're in for a fantastic ride. From the opening of \\"Brain of J.\\" to the end of \\"All Those Yesterdays\\" you hear a very well put together and potent album. The album's only weak link is \\"Red Dot\\", which is purely filler. But with such a great album, it's easily forgotten. Unlike most fans, I was not nuts over \\"Do the Evolution\\" (the song of which Pearl Jam made it's first video for since the days of \\"Ten\\") when I first heard it. But over the years it has grown on me. A little silly in some areas, but over-all a good rocker. Stand out tracks for me are \\"No Way\\" (EXTREMELY COOL song), \\"Given To Fly\\" (reminds me a little of \\"Jeremy\\" from \\"Ten\\"), \\"Wishlist\\" (beautiful song), \\"Low Light\\" (real moving), and \\"In Hiding\\" (Eddie really shows off his vocal talent). But all the other tracks are good in their own right, as well. If you loved their early days of \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs\\", chances are very likely you'll LOVE \\"Yield\\". Very impressive from start to finish, and considered by some as a classic effort from Pearl Jam. While some were not knowing what to think of \\"Vitalogy\\" and \\"No Code\\", they were pleasantly surprised with \\"Yield\\". Give it a try- you won't regret it.

B000002BFZ|4.0|After a somewhat disappointing \\"Vitalogy\\", Pearl Jam comes back with a powerful album entitled \\"No Code\\". If you were over all not pleased with \\"Vitalogy\\", you should give this album a try. It is probably one of their most experimental album to date, which seems to turn some people off. But in my opinion, this album is very solid and a pleasure to listen to. It was a time when Pearl Jam entered a new chapter in their career, and they seemed to step out of the dark closet that they were so buried in when they recorded \\"Vitalogy\\". It's been a couple years since Kurt Cobain's tragic suicide and a time when Pearl Jam were considering to quit the business all together. But they pulled through this tough time and put out a much better and focused album than \\"Vitalogy\\" could ever dream of being. \\"No Code\\" starts off with a very mellow but good track, \\"Sometimes\\", and then explodes with a hard \\"Hail, Hail\\" that is right up there with \\"Animal\\" and \\"Whipping\\" to name a couple. Then comes a little experimentation with \\"Who You Are\\" that really catches on after a few listens. So after the first three tracks alone, you know you are in for an interesting album. Through out \\"No Code\\", you hear a very raw but heavy sound, which after a couple listens really sounds great. You also hear dashes of Neil Young's influence every once in a while(Pearl Jam had done some work with him from time to time like \\"Mirror Ball\\"). With \\"No Code\\" it seems like the mellow tracks are mixed in just great with the harder tracks, and it sounds fairly consistent. And unlike \\"Vitalogy\\", this album only has ONE filler track, \\"Lukin\\", which isn't even that bad comparitively speaking. It's just super fast, hard, and short. The album's only weaker track is \\"Mankind\\", which follows a very good and impressive \\"Present Tense\\". Guitarist Stone Gossard (who, with Bassist Jeff Ament, started the group back in '91) sings for \\"Mankind\\" and it just doesn't sound that good. It seems kind of out of place on such a good album. But  after the rest of the album being so good, you can easily forgive and forget \\"Mankind\\". But who knows- you might like it anyway; I know a few people who do. So over all, \\"No Code\\" is a very good album and after \\"Vitalogy\\", it's like a breath of fresh air. Even the experimentation really grows on you after a while, and you get the feeling that the band was really trying to reinvent themselves here, and they did a real good job at that. It's a safe bet with \\"No Code\\". You should get it for \\"In My Tree\\" alone- that's perhaps the album's best and considered by many fans to be a Pearl Jam classic.
B0006399FS|1.0|They use the excuse of veering 'back to their roots' to conceal an annoying whole lack of new ideas and the pathetic selling out procress. These 'classic' songs just plain nothing but as much exposure as they can get. Pitiful. A vomit of selling out. <br /> <br />U2 feel forced to play for ever stupid sellout events - Grammy ('Apologize' included in order to sell more and more records of this bull***t), Super Bowl, VH1, etc - just to remain in the spotlight.  <br /> <br />They release a poor excuse for CD that sounds like a really shameful plagiarism of ATYCLB, and screaming nonsence (Vertigo, All Because Of You, for example) into a mic and playing the same ATYCLB formula with painfuly repetitive production just doesnt quite do it for me. They go on tour with their annoying iTunes crap and pick up a bunch of idiot poseur \\"fans\\" that think ATYCLB is \\"old school U2\\" and love this sellout era (2000- present). Taking us for granted again. This CD isn't worth your money, bonus DVD or not. Go invest in a good piece of music as Achtung Baby, Pop or War. <br /> <br />U2 compromised their whole talent from writing great songs into cheap corporate pap. They are going nowhere. Retiring is for after a successful career. U2 is hung up on making money. <br /> <br />By the way, read MRe's top 10 CD's of GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIMES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.

B00008GKEG|5.0|This is all you need if you want to know the whole story about the greatest band of all time PERIOD! The Beatles story told by the The Beatles themselves. Interviews of John over the years inter-twined with new interviews with Paul, George & Ringo. If only John had lived this would have been even more over the top,but what can you do? The bonus disc alone is worth the purchase price (which is very reasonable) George Martin sitting in the studio with all three going over tapes from the vaults, stuff that outside of Abbey Road Studios has never been heard in public before now. The three of them sitting on the grounds of Georges' in England talking about the old days, and of course the impromtu performance with George & Paul playing acoustic guitars with Ringo (of course) backing them up on drums. You hear Thinking Of Linking, a never heard song  by Paul&John and the instrumental Raunchy, which made George a member in 1957 when John & Paul heard him play it. I could go on and on but you get the picture. P.S. The videos for Free As A Bird & Real Love In 5.1 Stereo are here. Just buy it, you won't regret it. Cheers.................

B000002H2H|5.0|\\"Kill Em All\\" was pure thrash metal. But with their second record Metallica take it all one step further, break the boundaries of the (thrash metal-)genre and produce a timeless classic which is considered as their finest effort by many Metalli-bangers. \\"Ride The Lightning\\" offers high-speed solos, ultra-heavy riffs and something more. \\"Fade To Black\\", the fourth track of this milestone is half a ballad and half a really aggressive heavy song.The instrumental at the end of \\"Ride The Lightning\\" also shows how the musicians evolved. With the other songs( like the hymn \\"Creeping Death\\" or the ultra heavy mid-tempo song \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\") the Metallicats show that they still know how to play the best thrash metal of the whole world. What more can I say? The second assault from Hetfield,Burton(R.I.P.),Hammett and Ulrich is a classic and a great highlight in the discography of this legendary band.

B000002H33|5.0|Only few bands are able to bring out an equally great album after they already released a record, which was considered their best. Metallica are one of those few bands. After the strong debut and their brilliant second album they released \\"Master Of Puppets\\". Lots of people consider the third strike from Metallica their finest selection of heavy hitters. But you really cannot tell if \\"Master...\\" or \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is better. What's for sure is that EVERY song on this 1986 release is a heavy metal classic and that the band didn't stop their fight for world domination. To sum it up: A must have for everyone who is a true metalhead, period.

B0006SSOHC|5.0|Thrillers have gone and gone over the years without much notice.  For every great film, there were a dozen or more lackluster films thrown into the realm for no apparent purpose.  Saw follows the trend, but there are more than a few reasons that this film breathes new life into a rapidly dying genre. <br /> <br />This film places Adam and Lawrence in a single room.  Their objectives:  for one of them, it is to escape the room; for the other, it is to kill his fellow prisoner (otherwise, his family dies).  Following in the wake of Seven, this movie centers around the Jigsaw Killer (renowned for allowing his victims to find ways to kill themselves) and the puzzle that he presents the unlucky prisoners.  From start to finish, the movie unravels bit by bit, slowly revealing critical details of the plot surrounding the main characters, the killer, and several of the side characters as well.  Along the way, there are some truly memorable scenes (Adam's hunt for the murderer in the dark using his camera's flash) and more than one or two haunting images (a young woman who rips through a man's stomach to find the key needed to save her). <br /> <br />Two constant themes with most films of this type are the intelligence of the villain and evil often being able to outwit good.  Both properties are well emphasized here.  I won't spoil anything, but I can also say with confidence that the ending is not happy, and it's definitely not what you'll be expecting. <br /> <br />Though the acting is nothing spectacular and the movie was significantly underfunded, Saw entrances the viewer with a sweet, manaical storyline, an intricate cast of characters, and plot twist after unforgettable plot twist.  All in all, it ranks as one of the best films 2004 had to offer, resulting as a sinister combination of Seven and Identity.  It would be a true sin for any fan of psychological thrillers not to own this movie.

B0002234LS|5.0|Johnny Depp, the greatest actor in modern cinema, transforms from the brillaint scalliwag Jack Sparrow into the secluded writer Mort Rainey in this adaptation of Stephen King's short story.  This film garnered mixed reviews throughout 2004, but after seeing it, I have no idea why.  From start to finish, Depp's performance intrigues, from the ridiculous attire he wears at home to the cynical comments he makes to others.  The plot, as would be expected from a Stephen King story, is well crafted, and it builds progressively from start to finish.  In the end, the viewer is satisfied by a sweet, dark ending that Stephen King is so renowned for creating.  Secret Window was probably the most overlooked great film that 2004 had to offer.

B00009V7T2|5.0|OK, most people rate their \\"favorite\\" bands 5 stars, but this is a totally different musical experience. I will not describe the songs - listen to the samples! This is original music that sticks in your head and just won't let go. Descriptive words that come to mind are: original, complex, rich, interesting, uncategorizable, deep. The rhythms, melodies, and arrangements in De-Loused just get more interesting with every listen.  Many influences. WOW!!!!!!!!!! How did these guys do this ? I would rate most pop albums 2 or 3 stars, so consider this 5 star in that perspective.

B0000524CY|5.0|In retrospect, this has to be considered one of the top 25 American films of the second half of the 20th century.  The reason I am citing here in particular is the overt and powerful emphasis on the external.  Let's see what that means.<br /><br />American culture has always had a practical, \\"can do\\" orientation--a perspective that has consistently (at least since the advent of the Industrial Revolution, if not before) emphasized the accomplishment of goals through work.  That is, there's been a sledgehammer-like insistence, decade after decade, on the Protestant work ethic (also called Judeo-Christian work ethic).  The corollary of this emphasis is that any problems that arise do so based on external circumstances.  While there have been great American works of art pointing in the opposite direction (Miller's Death of a Salesman is a terrific example), these have not detracted from the still present today work ethic that informs how we live, work, and relate to each other.<br /><br />The Exorcist is much more than a horror film.  It's a potent drama that slams the viewer in the face with just how embedded we are in this Protestant/Judeo-Christian ethic by positing one of the worst problems ever (loss of control over one's actions) solely on the basis of an external influence--i.e., demonic possession.<br /><br />The reason this film works so incredibly well is that the writer, William Peter Blatty, and the director, William Friedkin, were both smart enough to know that shock for shock's sake and all the grotesque tricks that little Regan pulls as a demon (the spider walk, the 360 degree head turn, etc.) don't add up to a hill of beans unless the demonically possessed little girl is contrasted with her opponents who are themselves riddled with problems.  Thus, the source of the extreme problem--a blatantly external influence (demon)--meets other external influences (this time on the side of good) whose own internal lives are in chaos.<br /><br />What this does, interestingly enough, is to emphasize even more how obvious the American perspective on the external really is. Why?  Because in spite of their doubts and fears, these two priests are committed to fighting this external influence, this demon, until, come Hell or high water, they win.  And in this film, yes, Hell does come.  It's really pretty amazing how strong a drama this is, after more than 30 years, and how weak and pathetic many other copycat films are in comparison.<br /><br />The Exorcist succeeds both in scaring us because of its relentless insistence on the external vs. the internal, and in providing a cinematic work that does not rely primarily on jolts (though it certainly does have its share of those), but on the emotional depths to which those affected by this extreme of external influence can sink. Regan's mother, played by Ellen Burstyn--who gives a powerhouse performance--is, in fact, the real star of the show, running the gamut of eomtions from exuberance to complete despair.<br /><br />Max von Sydow and Jason Miller as the priests are also great, and in an uncharacteristic role--i.e., not as a heavy--Lee J. Cobb comes off well, though he doesn't have much to do, as a detective who's baffled by the goings on.<br /><br />A remarkable piece of work that is still fresh in 2005, The Exorcist is a film to add to any collection of best American cinema in the last 50 years.does, interestingly enough, is to emphasize even more how obvious the American perspective on the external really is.

B00067ZONA|4.0|From what I had read on the Genesis website I was anticpating that this mix would have far less redundency with TURN IT ON AGAIN -THE HITS (1999) than it does.  The content runs in reverse chronological order, in terms of the featured albums (Calling all Stations notwithstanding).  Do they think listeners would be turn off if they started at the beginning?<br />Disc 3 features selections from the Gabriel years.  The only major omissions that stick out here are Watchers of the Sky and perhaps Sour Turns to Sweet (if for no other reason than having a token track from the first album). They should have put In The Cage instead of Carpet (the 99 version is far better anyway) or Counting. Kudos for including the some prog classics: Knife, Supper, Fifth.<br />Disc 2 features the pre-superstardom Collins years 76-81.  There are many alternative tracks that could have gone on here.<br />Disc 1 features the superstardom years 84-97.  Most of this was already on TURN IT ON AGAIN.  Too bad they have the edit version of Tonight, the album version is best track of the Collins era.<br />Rather than featuring the same stuff that was already on TURN IT AGAIN, this collection would have been better off featuring more of the overlooked material.  That said, 3CDs does provide space for many fan-favourite album tracks.<br />At any rate this collections does give you the (more of less) best of both worlds - and hopefully it will introduce many listeners to the band's excellent 70s material.<br />The catch is that real fans would already have all their albums, while many casual fans who are only familiar with the hits would find TURN IT ON AGAIN a more economical selection.

B0006J28L4|1.0|Malcolm X is one of my favorite movies ever, a classic film that puts all of Spike's and Ernest's talents into one enjoyable, visually and stylistically spectacular piece. <br /> <br />and then they completely crap on all of it with this disc. <br /> <br />THE GREATST FLAW (and fatal flaw) of this disc is to have the film broken up into TWO PARTS! on TWO DIFFERENT DISCS! WHAT IN THE BLUE HELL IS GOING ON?!?!?!?! <br /> <br />this is simply inexcusable. if i wanted to change discs, i would be watching a laser disc. in 1985. <br /> <br />i can't possibly imagine how this made it past discussion and into production. the movie just comes to an abrubt halt, and then asks for disc 2. <br /> <br />yet you have two documentaries and other extras, also split between the discs. has the universe gone retarded, or why did they not put the film on one disc, and the extras on the second?!?!  unbelievable, and SO disappointing. <br /> <br />the second complaint would be the inclusion of the clothing stylist on the commentary track. she just LOVES to interrupt classic scenes with comments on how she chose a pair of socks for a third level character. rambling on and on. good grief. she did a great job on production design, granted, but i want to hear from Spike and Ernest, the cinematographer. i want to hear about the scenes themselves, about the classic \\"Spike\\" touch and technique, and after years of waiting for a commentary track, classic scenes don't have Spike's comments, but some completely irrelevant comments about an antique store that had this lamp, it was a charming store, they had lots of nice items, blah blah blah. ruined. <br /> <br />i can only hope Spike has been kidnapped and replaced by a retarded robot, and that someday he will escape his evil captors and redo this disc as it should be done.

B00006879E|5.0|I'm a sucker for good vocals. As such, I hope you can understand why I hate a lot of what's on the radio these days. <br /> <br />Thankfully, Maroon 5 has become a saving grace. I'm pleased to find a band and a disc that crosses boundaries and remains fresh and creative. <br /> <br />Songs About Jane is primarily a showcase for the amazing talents of frontman Adam Levine. Vocally, Adam draws from Steve Wonder, George Michael and Sting; lyrically, the imagery is equal parts Bernie Taupin and Joni Mitchell. The result is simply stunning. <br /> <br />Tracks such as \\"Sunday Morning\\" provide astoundingly deep but approachable lyrics; phrases like \\"Sunday morning, rain is falling / Steal some covers, share some skin / Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable / You twist to fit the mold that I am in\\" are absolute poetry that any songwriter would envy. <br />Add in some double-entendres that would make George or Prince smile (\\"I tried my best to feed her appetite / Keep her coming every night / So hard to keep her satisfied\\"), and you've got a  fun edge that keeps the disc youthful and energetic. <br /> <br />Coupled with Levine's delicate but powerful vocals, the songs take on a life; these are tracks you can FEEL. Helping them along is a tight band that combines the best of R&B grooves with modern rock. The sound is the best of different worlds coming together. <br /> <br />This isn't another \\"number band\\" that aspires to be punk or \\"alternative\\"; nor is it a disc that tries to be \\"hip\\" and \\"funky.\\" What it is is an honest appreciation of music and a clever sense of creativity. <br /> <br />I hate to be so esoteric, but Songs About Jane is just that deep. I can't do one of those \\"Track #5 rocks! WHOOO!\\" reviews because there is simply too much to discuss here. Bottom line: Think Stevie Wonder, Sting, Matchbox 20. <br /> <br />I think you'll agree: Maroon 5 will be loved.

No one is stressed, no one is hateful, and everyone ACTUALLY uses precise language ( Eh-hem, unlike some places now... ).

Would i say blackwater park is their best..no! In my personal opinion that would be their album still life.  Blackwater park i would call still life part 2, Don't get me wrong this is one of their best and you should definately give it a spin, but where still life flowed in it's song stucture blackwater park at times seems choppy. This is not to the album's disadvantage though! Blackwater park is yet another land mark album from one of the most amazing groups to credit the metal world! Still here are the trademark dark/light shifts in sound that opeth are known for, but thanks to porcupine tree's Steven Wilson the production on this album is quite possibly flawless and fluid in sound.<br /><br />Their may be a little evolution in the guitar playing, as seems to be typical with each new opeth release and Mikael's vocals are as always astounding.<br /><br />Personal favorites on this album: Bleak, Harvest, Drapery falls, And blackwater park.<br /><br />This album as with any opeth release would be a credit to your collection, And if you have still life and wind up liking this, look toward the dual attack of their albums deliverance and damnation.
B00006BTCA|5.0|THE JOY DIVISION COMPARISONS MUST STOP. Kiddies, just because a critic in Rolling Stone or whatever thought he heard some JD influence in this doesn't mean you all have to be \\"hip\\" and start saying the same thing. Just so you know...the band don't even listen to Joy Division (except for Carlos D but I doubt he's responsible for their ultimate sound). Why don't you be creative and compare them to another band? Everyone is sick and tired of hearing you little hipsters drone on about how they ripped off Joy Division...it's not new, and it's not clever. I've heard enough JD to recognize some similarities, but I'm not dumb enough to go off and say Interpol are ripping them off. Yeah, so Paul's vocals do sound something like Ian Curtis' but who can blame the vocal chords??? Then again...why not compare Paul to Jim Morrison? Or even Neil Young? They sound kinds of alike....why fixate on Curtis? I personally love the way Paul sounds. No, it's not some sort of BEAUTIFUL, talented singing, but it sounds perfect with the music. Imagine if Paul's voice sounded like Lou Reed's.... it would take away the charm from the music. <br /> <br />Anyways, onto the actual album.... <br />All the songs seem to have sort of a 'dark' element to them without sounding too depressing or angry. The first track is mainly an instrumental one, without many vocals. This is one of my least favorite tracks as I find it repetitive and even kind of boring at times. \\"Obstacle 1\\", however, is one of the best songs on the album. The guitar chords are so simple and don't require much technique but with Paul's vocals howling over the guitar, it sounds incredible. People often say Paul sings in monotone and that they don't feel any emotion in his voice. If you are one of those people, listen to this song and you will be proven wrong. If you listen to the song as a whole, you might not have much reaction to it, but if you listen to every single element of the song (the drums, the guitar, the bass, and especially the vocals) separately you start to feel it. The same emotion can be felt in \\"The New\\". I can see how in this song he does mostly sing in a monotone fashion, yet I still feel the emotion in his lyrics. The song is pretty dynamic too, changing from a mellow beginning to a more emotional 'chorus' with Paul crying out his lyrics, and then finally changing to an almost fully instrumental ending of the next 4 minutes or so. Once again, this instrumental is ridiculously simple, with the guitar chords hardly changing but it doesn't require any impressive skills to make it sound mesmerizing. <br /> <br />Now I have to mention \\"Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down\\". This is SUCH a great song. It's somewhat mellow, dynamic, and the drums and bass work incredibly well together. Here I do agree that there's not too much emotion in his voice except when he sings \\"she broke away, broke away\\". It's like I hear him WANTING to belt those lyrics out even louder. When he sings \\"Stella...Stella....Oh Stella....Stella I love you, Stella I love you, Stella I love you\\" I have to close my eyes and concentrate those tiny, almost inaudible vocal changes. When you concentrate that hard, you feel the emotion practically exploding within the song. <br />Now....Leif Erikson....when I first listened to the album in its entirety, I thought the song was boring and I skipped over it every time. I didn't start to like it until a month or more after listening to the album. It's a beautiful closer with strange lyrics, but somehow they compel me. <br /> <br />Excellent debut; I don't know how they could've made it any better than it is.
B0006399FS|2.0|I simply couldn't bring myself to accept this music. Last night I decided to give it another shot, start to finish. This experience only confirmed one thing: this is their very worst album. Bono and The Edge are really sub-par lyricists, and the lyrics are obviously meant to ape the themes found in Joshua Tree era recordings. Do you think Bono was really all that concerned about talking and intimacy, or he and the men needed an excuse to tour and make bajillions of dollars again? The very lowest point is the horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE pieces \\"A Man And A Woman\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't...\\".  <br /> <br />Bono is now among the most low quality rough struggle singers I've ever heard, and I haven't heard lyrics that awful and trite since the last time I heard Lenny Kravitz's \\"Dragonfly\\" which thankfully has not been for a long time. There are some nice moments (and I do mean moments, like two- or three-second snippets) here and there, but all in all, U2's playing is nowhere near as ferocious as it was on War, Pop or even Rattle & Hum stand-out tracks like \\"Desire\\" or \\"God Part 2\\" (one Bono's best moments), and his voice isn't as strong and pure as it used to be.  <br /> <br />Then there are all the obligatory U2isms: Edge's trademark guitars, keyboards, \\"epic\\" sound and \\"Joshua Tree\\" production, mid tempo songs, Bono's rough \\"emotional\\" voice, a slower B-side, distant and the like. Couldn't they have done something original? I've read that upon hearing ATYLCB, as Roger Waters called \\"Pink Floyd\\" A Momentary Lapse Of Reason something like \\"a clever, quite facile forgery,\\" and I agree. ATYCLB used some U2 cliches just to maintain an \\"authentic\\" atmosphere, but that album was just as awful and cheap through and through as this one. HTDAAB like \\"Star Wars, Episode One,\\" is a disappointing, worthless example of totally formulaic drivel. If you're still a U2 fan and this CD gives you some sort of satisfaction, then you must be a total lunkhead, because in even the most objective sense this album absolutely reeks. <br /> <br />It seems likely that this `band' is now doing studio albums merely as an excuse to tour, under the pretense that they aren't a has been nostalgia act, and perhaps because there's is more morning in a tour, than doing a good studio album. Well, they might as well be.  <br /> <br />Studio album, live DVD, studio album, live DVD, must seem by now as suspicious to even the most diehard fans.  <br />
B000002UAR|3.0|At the end of the day, like it or hate it... what other album by a band from the 60s or indeed any generation is still being actively discussed and disputed to this very day? They must have been doing something right...
B0006J28KU|4.0|I waited on the arrival of a DVD with extras beyond the old, featureless format. Mann's commentary is one of the best I've heard. These were always interesting characters but Mann reveals that a lot of work went into the development of each of them. A lot of the psychology behind the characters and the movie is explained. Some of the extras include real police interviews that were used as consultants for the script. One complaint: the deleted scenes seem incomplete as if the front and back ends were cut short. Two scenes with Sizemore seem a waste. One where he's in a toy store checkout, the other when he's at a daycare. Not clear where these scenes would have fit into the movie. Most deleted scenes should stay that way in my opinion. Deleted for good reasons. Each are short. A \\"PLAY ALL\\" feature would have been nice.
B0006399FS|4.0|Get over it, guys. Get a life. And while you're at it, get a little perspective. U2 hasn't made a great album since 1991, so why is everyone so surprised this isn't an instant classic? For the love of Christ, what's with all the hateful reviews here? If you're annoyed with the iPod commercial, don't buy one. If you're furious over ticket sale screw-ups, go sue. But don't relieve your frustration by pouring scorn on this album which, like the last, is no major breakthrough but otherwise just fine. Apart from the slight misstep that was \\"Pop\\", for twenty-five years U2 has been the world's most consistently excellent rock act. Full credit to Daniel Lanois for inventing their classic sound, but kudos to the boys for pushing it through every reinvention imaginable while only occasionally losing sight of the things that make it great. \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" gives it a twist, one more lyrically and musically adventurous than 2000's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" which was a necessarily conservative return to form. Tracks like 'Miracle Drug', 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' and 'City of Blinding Lights' take the anthem-ballads U2 are best at and trick them out with both sonic experimentation (especially in the rhythm section) and renewed sensitivity, while the opener, 'Vertigo', shows what four master craftsmen and a good producer can still do with a solid rock hook and no shame. 'One Step Closer' is as delicate and beautiful as anything they've done , 'Yahweh' is a masterclass in subtle engineering and arrangement, and 'Crumbs From Your Table' is possibly the pick of the album. This is confident, forthright, interesting music from a band who knows who they are. It also proves that when they stray too far from the Lanois/Eno template, it doesn't always work. But so what? What's wrong with a little variety now and then? It's obviously nowhere near the level of their masterworks - \\"War\\", \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and the peerless \\"Achtung Baby\\" - but it does deliver a few of those magical U2 moments where Bono's lyrics and the Edge's guitars conspire to have your spine tingling and your heart blown open at precisely the same moment.eliver a few of those magical U2 moments where Bono's lyrics and the Edge's guitars conspire to have your spine tingling and your heart blown open at precisely the same moment. <br />
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Both Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise deserved Best Actor nominations for this movie, Michael Mann deserved Best Director, and this should have been nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film. Jamie Foxx is a lead in this movie and was actually nominated for Best Supporting Actor, not sure what is with that-is an actor not allowed to have two Best Actor nominations? Tom Cruise plays the best professional killer since the original Terminator, and there is even a homage to that movie in the club shoot-out. But Tom plays a human, not a machine, and truly deserves Best Actor for his performance. Allegedly Tom Cruise had never fired a real gun before training for this movie, and his pure-speed athleticism shows off with the two street thugs and the takedown in the club, where Cruise is so fast you can only fully understand the action when watching it in slow motion. In the Director's commentary, Michael Mann waxes eloquently on the digital camera photography and the artsy visual poetry is in the beautiful night scenes of Los Angeles. The cinematography is so beautiful that it can almost be enjoyed by itself with the sound off-- like the scene where the taxi stops while two coyotes cross the street. There's clever camera work like the \\"falling camera\\" shown just before the body hits the top of the taxi. But by turning off the sound you'd miss the clever dialog and soundtrack. The comeback to the accusatory \\"You killed him!\\" is one of the best movie lines of all time: \\"No, I shot him. Bullets and the fall killed him.\\" The AudioSlave scoring from the coyote scene to the club shootout is in itself worth buying the CD, which also includes the Miles Davis jazz scene. But like an iceberg, this movie is really about what is going on underneath the psyche of the two men: the sociopath's cold heart is slowly being pierced while the procrastinator is finally forced to face his complete lack of leadership and initiative for action. Quite simply, this is not only the best movie of 2004but one of the best movies of all time. Watch it once \\"as is\\", then watch it again to slo-mo Tom Cruise's action secenes, then watch it again with Michael Mann's commentary. Fantastic!
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is music at John Williams' best! He has put a medieval tone into the songs while still keeping the basic tune heard in the first two soundtracks. Each Prisoner of Azkaban song is exciting, sad, or scary. I highly recommend Double Trouble, Buckbeak's Flight, A Window to the Past, The Patronus Light, The Werewolf Scene, and Finale. This music is worthy of an Oscar. Even if you didn't like the first two soundtracks, you will love The Prisoner of Azkaban.
B0006GAOBI|2.0|I love \\"Donnie Darko\\", but was rather disappointed with this overhyped Director's Cut.  The film is now overexplained and overcooked, traits that made the original theatrical / DVD release so mesmerizing (incidentally, the 20 minutes added are already on the original DVD).  The director's choice to replace the Echo & the Bunnymen \\"Killing Moon\\" song with INXS' \\"Never Tear Us Apart\\" ruined the beginning of the film for me. <br /> <br />Stick with the original.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This truly is the best movie I have ever seen! Alfonso Cuaron was the perfect director for this movie. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint performed their parts better with dramatically improved acting. John Williams' musical score is beautiful and captures the fear, action, and emotion. The visual effects are incredible and worthy of an academy award. I would give the story an A+++! I highly recommend The Prisoner of Azkaban for anyone, fan or not.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Nothing like the ordinary movies out there, Waking Life makes you THINK. I loved it. My late husband loved it. It's original and funny and thought provoking. Put into cartoon mode, it first appears to be a stupid parody but you will be surprised. You may even see yourself in this delightful production. If not yourself, you'll at the very least recognize someone you KNOW.    If you want pure enjoyment with a touch of enlightenment, buy this movie for your library collection.

B0006399FS|1.0|U2 used to be one of my fav bands, now I have to say Old U2 is one of my fav bands because I dont recognize this \\"new\\" U2, its boring and commercialized to the bone. They sold their souls to Apple and Grammy no doubt about that. They have gonne way too fabricated, too sellout, too MTV, too pop icons.  <br /> <br />No longer they are the rebel or the avant garde of rock, now they are MTV darlings and Bono is a bland politician in the cover of Time magazine. This album is like a bad Garth Brooks album. Boring, flat, predictible and lacking the trademark rage of early recordings, just grab an old recording and compare it to this one, this one seems to be produced by Bon Jovi and Dolly Parton. I simply cannot believe this are the same people that brought us 'Unforgetable Fire', 'Zooropa', 'Pop', 'Boy', 'Achtung Baby', 'War' and 'the Joshua Tree'. After being a fan for 23 years , I can leave behind this piece of corporate s**t in the same place I left 'October' and 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'. Bono and Co. lost its edge and it shows in the lyrics and music. Goodbye U2. <br /> <br />
1577311523|4.0|My late husband and I bought this book after hearing so much about it through spiritual channels. He liked it, as he was always open and receptive to anything that talked of Truth. I was disappointed in it. Although I can certainly relate to the 'Now' as being the only power, because God is the only 'Power' and God is certainly in the 'Now', I found it somewhat repetitive. Once I grasped what he was saying, the rest became boring as I realized I already knew what he was talking about so why go further?    I did not find it 'spiritual' but rather psychological in its deliverance of, what seemed to me, overcoming one power with another. Also, Tolle writes a lot about pain, which seems like the mind wants to stay on that word and have it etched rather than on the opposite one of 'health' or 'well-being' or God. Now I know a lot of people have pain in their lives and this is a very real word to eliminate or 'overcome' with the power of 'now', but I think he emphasized the word 'pain' too much. For those who use affirmations as a way of overcoming negatives, this book would not have done it for me, and it may not for you either. I really don't know how the book got to be so popular. Tolle must have had a good advertising campaign to get it off the ground and into people's homes through promotion.    It may be a good book for those starting on a spiritual journey or for those who are not quite there yet, or as a complement to other spiritual books in one's library, but it didn't appeal to me as a book worthy of holding on to.

B000002BBY|4.0|Whats the story is a great album with some great tunes on it, however since '95 it has been overplayed to a criminal level and hs lost the freshness it first had. in addition it descends to often into wanky, self-congratulatory guitar riffs that became the hallmark of later albums such as Be here Now. It does not have the freshness and rawness of Definitely Maybe which blows this album out of the water and is probably my favourite album ever (with the possible exception of abbey road) Overall it is a good album but Oasis can never surpass their incredible debut
B0002S947K|5.0|Listen to this CD over and over again. Really love Forever My Friend and Hannah. Discovered the album after hearing Trouble on the radio a few times. This is a great find!
B000002AS3|5.0|This album blows me away. Almost every song is incrdeible but the stand out has to be the sneeringly brilliant and bemusingly abstract Supersonic, my favourite song ever. this is not my favourite album (nothing beats abbey road) but it comes close. people who say whats the story morning glory is better need their heads examined. Noel Gallagher had written most of the songs that appear on the first 3 albums before the release of Definitely Maybe and (clearly) choose the best for this album
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I must admitt, I have never read the Illiad and even if I had read it, I don't like analyzing perfectly good movies. I thought this film was excellent and it has definatley resparked my interest in Greek or Roman mythology. I also happen to be a hopeless romantic so I loved the conflicts between Helen and Paris as well as Achilles and Briseis. This film kept me glued to the screen and I've watched it three times since (the first time was last night.) If you have read the Illiad and are deeply critical of movies, then I dont think this one is for you. But otherwise, try it, you might enjoy it.
B000062YAZ|4.0|Reign In Blood was Slayers biggest commercial success, dont get me wrong when i saw that this music is about as far from Commercial as you can get! Heavy drums, rumbling bass, larger then life vocals, anti-everything lyrics and guitars by kerry King and Jeff Hanaman that are not to be messed with!<br /><br />The album opens with the killer track 'Angel Of Death' with is classic Slayer, heavy riffs and just and all around scary song! Necrophobic is hte heaviest damn song I have ever heard! The guitar solo on this song is the coolest guitar solo I have ever heard a thrash guitarist play, I mean it's just down right insane! 'Jesus Saves' is the best song that Slayer ever recorded. My friend came over one day and thought that it was going to be like christian rock like that band Stryper and then he put the record on and totaly freaked out, it was so awesome. Jesus Saves has always been my all time favorite Slayer song. 'Postmortum' is another killer song with a really cool guitar riff by King. The lyrics to this song scar the hell out of me when I listen to them. I love that song. the title track 'Reign In Blood' is one of the darkest and scariest songs you have ever heard, or ever will hear. Easily the second best song on the album just behind Jesus Saves. The rest of the songs on the album are good as well it's just that they all sound the same is all.<br /><br />Had this album had more diverse material that didnt sound exactly the same I would have gave it a full five stars. This album is just over 40 minutes long and one of the hardest albums I have ever heard! Do your self a favor and pick up this classic metal record!
B00004SYWZ|5.0|One reviewer called this album \\"Disappointing,\\" on March 22, 2003, saying, \\"I'm not surprised they're not around in the States. ... There are few, if any hooks on the entire album.\\"<br /><br />I believe (s)he has a point. The music is not that memorable when you first play it a few times. You might look at the song titles and be unable to recall the melodies, so instead of calling this music catchy, I call it interesting. It grows on you. I believe this album has a number of nods to the Beatles and perhaps to an anthem-reverie-Christian-worship song. Good stuff.
B000089CJI|5.0|This is one of my top five all-time favorite albums.  It's simply awesome from start to finish, which doesn't always happen with albums.  The District Sleeps Alone Tonight is one of those songs you can repeat to yourself constantly and it's always good, I love it.  From there it's purely superb, Such Great Heights, Sleeping In, Nothing Better--they're all good.  So if you haven't bought this cd, you're missing out on pure musical genius.  And so buy it RIGHT NOW, I beg of you.
B00008OLYN|5.0|DAMN, this is one hell of a cd. Haunting. Dire. Malefic. Simultaneously heavy and not heavy. I love it. Windowpane is just an incredible song. These guys can kick ass when they want to, and then tear at your soul with a few plucks of the guitar strings.
B00007BH5C|5.0|If you listen to the music than you remember every scene of the movie. The music is so good. Howard did a very good job.
B00006SFBD|4.0|Why does everyone keep praising the growling vocals. It is not difficult to do. Try it sometime. You could go even deeper and beastly than this guy. I guarantee it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw this movie five times in the theater. I love it so much and can't wait to get it on DVD. I love Gerard Butler (Phantom), Emmy Rossum (Christine) and Patrick Wilson (Raoul). They all gave brilliant performances. The singing is breathtaking. The story is so good. The whole movie is amazing. Those who haven't seen it buy it on DVD. You don't make any mistake.
0802130208|5.0|This novel's brawl of a plot revolves around one of the most memorable characters in 20th century American fiction: the grossly rotund, incredibly verbose and most heavily egocentric braggart Ignatius Reilly. An oafish loser, in some respects, Reilly also exercises a most beautiful mind and lyrical tongue. Revolving around Reilly is a cast of freakish characters that are also defined by their weaknesses and unfulfilled dreams. The setting is New Orleans. And this literary trip into a grim and desperate part of the Big Easy is definitely worth taking.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I love this music. It's so good. Howard did a really nice job. The music is perfect for the movie.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|It's true that Madeleine Peyroux sounds a lot like Billie Holiday in both her voice and her phrasing but that's okay. Both Harry Connick and Bobby Darin made good careers from reminding people of a young Sinatra. Peyroux or someone chose a wonderful collection of songs all which fit the album's theme pefectly. She has a beautiful, smokey bourbon on the rocks voice, like Lady Day and she's using it to marvelous effect here. Nevermind what you saw at the Grammy's. This was the best album to come out of 2004.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|Clive Owen was the actor who could save the movie. If he wouldn't have been in the movie, I think I would have left the theater. The movie makes no sense. Julia and Jude weren't really good (although I like Jude). Natalie was ok. But Clive Owen was brilliant.
B000670DQI|3.0|This is a good album. Not as good as Heathen from a couple of years ago, but very good nonetheless. I got someone to bring it back from the USA, as Dualdisc hasn't yet been officially released in the UK. Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's a good surround mix, and at least I can play it in my car and rip it to my iPod, unlike normal DVD-A. But what a missed opportunity to only have the surround side in Dolby Digital. There's plenty of capacity on a DVD to incorporate both a proper 96 KHZ 24 bit 5.1 DVD-A version of the surround mix, as well as a standard DD version. And good as it is, the surround mix doesn't sound as natural, vibrant or crystal clear as a good high-res audio version would have. I hope future Dualdisc releases incorporate proper DVD-Audio surround mixes.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|The christmas movie of 2005. I can't wait to see it. Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts play the lead. I love Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. The story is famoous and Peter Jackson's storytelling and action are brilliant.
B00062IVKS|5.0|For the past few years I felt this film has been forgotten a bit. Now it is re-released on DVD in a special 2 disc form. The bonus disc is so great and well worth the money alone! Almost better than the film. If you loved the Rocky movies or if you loved the mob films like The Godfather or Goodfella's, This is the best of both worlds for you!! Boxing and the mob back in the day WERE hand in hand. This real life story shows that. However, Jake LaMotta never wanted to sell out or take a dive for the fixed money. You can still find an old copy of this film on DVD but this brand new 2 disc version is the way to go.
B00000JLWW|5.0|It's next to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" my favorite movie. It's such a beautiful movie. Leo and Kate did an amazing job. I love it and will always love it.
B000286RKW|5.0|This ONE film was able to pull off what The Godfather took 3 films to do! I love the story-telling of this film. It is gritty and violent and nasty. It covers the career of a young wanna be wise guy from the age of 12 to his early 30's. If you love good mafia stories in film and have never seen this one...You are missing a BIG one here! The bonus features on the second disc are fantastic! At this price what are you waiting for??

068987474X|3.0|Finally, a truthfull book. Not for the the overly-sensative this honest (some might say brutal) book reveals the truth about all those exuces or lies, the revalation behind those sleepless nights wondering why he didnt call: He's just not that into you. As only a guy can tell it, Greg plows ahead, answering all girls quesions in the dating world, as Liz runs behind, despratly trying to soften the blow. Sorry Liz-not wotking. An all-arould great book, it you can ignore all those \\"why it might not be that simple\\" commentaries , a.k.a \\"exuces\\" made by Liz. Which brings me to my intitial question: whose idea was it to co-auther this book, anyway? -S
B00005LMBK|5.0|The Gorillaz are probably one of the best Collaberation groups ever and have brilliant and talented Music, I simply love this group, they are so underrated and sadly ignored and baffled by MTV goons who love Good Charlate.

I love this group so much, there probably the second best Musical group ever next to Massive Attack... <br />  <br />The best songs in this brilliant Album is Rehash, 5/4, Tommorow Comes Today, Clint Eastwood, Sound Check, New Genious, Dracula,  <br /> <br />And the 2 really awesome songs are M1A1, Left Hand Suzuki method.. <br /> <br />This is just untapped brilliance that everyone should check out.

0670033375|1.0|This book was a complete waste of time. I can't believe anyone would buy this book. Jared just relies on the general idiots ignorance to pull his own personal agenda throughout the entire book. There are so many false claims.

B00005JNPZ|5.0|Hi, yes, this movie uses the typical 3 point holywood script, and is predictable. But it is very good entertainment. <br /> <br />The three lead actors do an incredible job of portraying in a comical way what most of us go through and would do to meet the person of our dreams to spend our life with. <br />
B0006J28BO|4.0|I feel there is no need to go over the basic plot of the story since so many have done a far better job than I could ever do.  Instead I will cover a few minor points that weren't mentioned in other reviews. <br /> <br />Having seen this movie on a big screen in original Japanese, with English Subtitles, I fell in love with this movie immediately.  With a few exceptions, like the substitution of a few lines (e.g. a couple light \\"perv\\" references) and the numerous annoying \\"Babe\\" comments, the essence of the original was retained in the American release.  I am slightly displeased that the subtitles are off of the English dialogue, not the Japanese.  Nonetheless this is a great movie to add to any animation collection.
B0002S94OS|4.0|Sometimes a major record label's big production job can be a good thing. The production on \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" is better than that of \\"As the Palaces Burn\\", and the end result is good.  <br /> <br />The full-on metal/thrash attack is still in tact (Lamb of God did not add any melody to this album), but Randy Blythe's vocals are more interesting (and they're done in a way that the listener can discern what he's saying--most of the time.) Blythe belts out a Cookie Monster yell/growl about 90% of the time, but he also shrieks and says the occasional spoken word. But the biggest change here is that his voice's pitch is more diverse than on the last album. This also adds some needed texture to Lamb's music. <br /> <br />Drummer Chris Adler can go from a wild, machine gun attack and death metal blasts to a slow chug (\\"Break You\\" is a good example this.) The blowtorch guitar riffs are pretty insane too; they're thrashy, crunchy and fast. All the while, Blythe is bashing war, President Bush, and pretty much all forms of authority.  <br /> <br />\\"Laid to Rest\\" opens with a pouding beat and a shriek. It then turns to a grinding lurch which gains speed off of itself, and around the two and half minute mark, the riffs and drums turn to a bobbing beat. <br />\\"Now You've Got Something to Die For\\" opens with another shriek, which is still ringing in my ears. The beat begins by grooving, while the drums are pummeling and the song eventually turns to a thunderous, \\"boom-boom\\".  <br />\\"Blood of the Scribe\\" begins as a very speedy song, but then a beat/speed change kick in and slows things down. The guitars churn out fast chug-chug riffs, but then change and make almost a beeping noise. <br />\\"Ashes of the Wake\\" is a personal favorite. A recorded voice (from what sounds like a CNN report) begins the track, but for the most part this song is a six-minute long instrumental track featuring five (albeit short) guitar solos from Megadeth's Chris Poland and Testament's Alex Skolnick (I'd say the third, winding guitar solo is my favorite.)  <br />\\"Remorse is For the Dead\\" begins with slow, dwindling soft guitar chords, which eventually stop and things kick into first gear for the typical Lamb of God assault. <br /> <br />So, this album is the band's best work to date. Some say they are the modern day equivalent of Slayer or Pantera, and while I don't think they're that good, I think they definitely have the potential and talent to be.  <br /> <br />Even though they are different than other New Wave of American Heavy Metal band's (due to the almost constant double bass drumming and death metal growl), it's essential for fans of The New Wave. I also recommend it if you're new to The New Wave, or if you're a metal/thrash fan.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|I had been enchanted by WT. I have never heard such an enchanting symphonic metal abum ever.... No doubt there are tons of symphonic metal band b4 WT but I still think WT has their unique sound and signatures.... As I am writing this review, I am also watching their music video on their web site. I love this symphonic metal genre type of music.... Love everything about it. Really stands out and distinguish itself from everything else. I don't have to say anything else cause most of it has been said. Let the music do the talking.... Highly recommended....

B0000AOV85|5.0|We are all fans of DSOTM, you know.   <br /> <br />This symphonic rock concept album changed expectations of rock music forever.  Roger Waters and the Floyd developed their theme in this album the way a great symphonist from the 18th Century develops one.   <br /> <br />DSOTM transcends all other concept albums in this development.  It is unique in Rock history.  <br /> <br />This DVD, on of the Classic Album Series, is the story of this development.  It is, by the way, the best of all the \\"Classic Albums\\" DVD's in my opinion.   <br /> <br />Of course, the technical aspects are covered in detail (\\"just how did they synch all those clocks?\\") and looking over the mixing board and listening in on the original tapes is really fun.  <br /> <br />Even better is how the artists each reproduce performances which are then synched with the album.  Every time this happens, it's magical to watch.   <br /> <br />But the best part of this DVD is how each artist in turn lays down his rancor and tells the story of how this magical album comes together.  In the end, they are simple and honest, each realizing that the other contributed some part of this thing that became much greater than the whole.  <br /> <br />Pink Floyd will likely never collaborate again;  maybe they've said what they had to say.  For sure,  all the anger that flowed between them would be a giant ogre sitting on their shoulders.  So it's really nice to see this DVD, where they pay homage to each other, and to the incredible thing they made decades ago.
630469654X|5.0|Adventure and romance.  Beautiful countryside and period settings.  A wonderful feel good movie.  Excellent portrayal of the characters. <br />Soundtrack by Alan Parsons Project is fantastic, and superbly fitting for the action in the film.   <br /> <br />It does have a few scary parts, so the PG-13 rating is understandable.  Otherwise, it is good for the whole family. <br /> <br />I loved the entire thing.  (I immediately bought the soundtrack after viewing the film in the theatre.  That same summer, when I got a new Black Lab. puppy, I named him Navarre.)
B000002UXZ|5.0|Best music ever made. Beats anything out there. Theres only 1 dud like song. The master guitar playing makes these songs. Its just bueatiful. Ive listened to Led ZeppJimmy Page,doesn't do anything of this magnitude. Nothing as... groovy, listenable, and hypnotizing. Even though Jimi may notbeastechnically good as guys like JP, Eric Clapton, and quite a few others; he answers that with smooth, sexy playing. He wants to get you hyped up and dancing around playing a imaginary guitar(I know you do).  <br /> <br />\\"Changes\\" is the perfect example forthis. Its like the beginning of Voodoo Child but a faster, more funky version,throughout the song.  <br /> <br />\\"Who Knows\\" is a briliant idea, where Miles makes these crazy noises with his mouth for at least a minute straight, than Jimi comes back afterwards trying to make his guitar sound like Miles.Its so groovy.  <br /> <br />\\"Power to Love\\" has 1 of the coolest openings ever, where theres a few licks on the guitar blues style in the beginning, than theres kind of a pause, than boom Miles screams at same time Jimi starts his guitar solo, which is 1 of the most amazing soloes I've heard, it just explodes into your ears, and keeps you awing as it slowly calms down. Ive finally found a song with a tune RATM or Audioslave copied. Youll see.. <br /> <br />\\"Message of Love\\" is aight, I mostly just like the solo. Heck, all the soloes make the songs.  <br /> <br />\\"We Gotta Live Together\\" is sort of a dud. The first half is kind of a build up for whats to come, a crazy guitar solo. Jimi proves he can play pretty fast on this solo, but I dont know, it just doesnt sound right for some reason. The recording isnt as good as the others, although maybe I could have gotten 1 of the bad versions of the song...  still cant wait till I can blast it on my radio. <br /> <br />\\"Machine Gun\\" is a BEAST. It blows away every song in the books when it comes to creative aw inspiringguitar work done by Jimi. Its about a battle in Vietnam. He creates a battlefield with his guitar. Machine guns, planes, bombs... how cool is that? I havent seen any covers of this song because its just that good. There is a downside to it though. Its not as hip, funky, or groovy as the other songs, so you might have to be in a certain mood to listen to it. Most awesome solo ever. Hands down. Not even your imaginary guitar at home can play it. <br /> <br />Buy it. Burn it. Do whatever you want. Just find some way to listen to it. Than go get yourself everything else by Jimi, but none of it is as good as this I tell you what.
B000000H66|4.0|'Symbolic' was the band's sixth CD. Have always thought that Death was ANOTHER under-appreciated death metal band (no pun intended there). Notice that ex-Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan is on the album. Top of the line in-your-face screaming death metal is what you get with Death. Cuts that I thought were the best include \\"1,000 Eyes\\", \\"Misanthrope\\", the heavy-ass \\"Perennial Quest\\" and \\"Zero Tolerance\\". A sad note, Death's main man, guitarist / vocalist Chuck Schuldiner had passed on awhile back from having a brain tumor. Should appeal to fans of Obituary, Carcass, Morbid Angel and Napalm Death.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Star Trek has moments of greatness. Star Wars was wonderful...in its day. This movie (I won't call it a TV series...that too often implies mediocrity) is extraordinary. Compelling scripts. Outstanding cinematography. Stellar ensemble acting. Modern special effects. My longstanding favorite movies have been films like Cinema Paradiso, Last of the Mohicans, and The Last Samurai. Firefly surpasses them all. I am so grateful that Backwoods Home Magazine guided us to Firefly. [...]
B0001CNRB6|4.0|Lover Come Back hasn't aged quite as well as its predecessor, Pillow Talk. The main characters aren't as sympathetic, and the pace isn't quite as tight. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, who could resist the brilliant trio of stars in Rock Hudson, Doris Day and Tony Randall? They are given some really excellent material to work with in Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning's witty script. The sex-angle is a step up from Pillow Talk, and must have been quite shocking to audiences at the time! The innuendo is smartly handled, however.
6304708521|5.0|i am sick of people complaining becasue they could find the plot well thats because there isn't one  <br />the funniest bit of the movie is when the lennon wizard comes in and says 'talk about magical mystery, i spent half an hour looking for that sugar' other great bit include when 'flying' starts and 'i am the walrus!!!!'dont even get me started on that wonderful, also when ' your mother should know' starts is also a gas
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Michael Jackson is unbreakable and no one can compare. Who cares what he looks like or does in his personal life. Get past the packaging and you will see that inside beats the heart of a normal, loving and wonderfual human being. Those poeple who pick on Michael Jackson are just jealous. As far as the box set is concerned, what is there to say? This is MJ. Its all good if you know how to appreaciate music. Worth the money.
B000006TRV|5.0|I'm 15. When I was 7 I didn't know what Pink Floyd was, didn't think I'd be listening to it. Well, I am, and it sure is better than all the crap that these stupid generic rappers are churning out today. Who have no talent at all. Also, if your going to be writing a review on a respectable website like this, you should learn to spell, esp. if you think you're so grand. You wish you could play guitar like David Gilmour. It's people like you who have no appreciation for any form of art whatsoever and are an embarassment to society. <br /> <br />Eric B.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Even though I was a fan of At the Drive-In, I wasn't all that excited about The Mars Volta, cause everything I read about them talked as it they were gonna be a avant-garde psychedelic latin space jazz band or some such thing.  Something like that *could* be good, but that sounded like it was so far from what ATDI was that who the hell could tell.  It didn't even sound like they were gonna be a rock band. So I wasn't too interested.  Shortly after it 'De-Loused in the Comatorium' was released one of my friends got it, and I listened to it and was stunned by how rockin and excellent it was.  Yeah it's got jazz and psychedelic and latin flavoring, but it's all filtered through the basic ATDI post-hardcore style, making this a bizarre, prog-post-hardcore album, and still essentially an extension of ATDI style and ethic.  It a rather sever extension, admittedly, but the connection is eminently obvious.  Anyway, this is a fantastic, flawless album which is also my favorite album from 2003.<br /><br />Even though this is essentially a modern prog-rock album, it has all the energy and intensity you'd here on an ATDI album.  Many people out there seem to hate Cedric's shrieky, high-pitched vocals, but I think he's fantastic, and one of the most emotionally powerful vocalists around.  I can understand why some people hate him, as I hated him when I first heard ATDI, but most these people just need to lighten up and try to get into it.  The new rhythm work is fantastic, with  memorable, pulsing basslines, lots of frenetic, jazz-inflected drumwork and quite a bit of additional percussion.  There is a fair bit of leadwork on this album, though most of is not your typical guitar-heroic stuff, and the rhythm work is still largely jagged post-hardcore type stuff.  There's lots of electronics and keyboard stuff, and it generally works quite well and fleshes out the overall sound.  The organ is particularly nice.<br /><br />There are 8 full-length tracks on here, and they're all very good to excellent.  'Inertiac ESP' is one of the more straight forward tracks, nice and energetic and catchy.  'Roulette Dares' ups the experimentation with some low-key jazz interludes, and a blistering, memorable riff under the chorus, and excellent vocal work all around.  'Drunkship of Lanterns' is one of the more unique pieces, a more atmospheric song with an unrelenting, nervy rhythm section and amelodic, snapping guitar lines.  Arguably the weakest track on the album, but still quite good.  'Eriatarka' combines balladish, effecting verses with a jagged, striking chorus too good effect.  The transition between the two is particularly sweet, with the slight eerie melody underneath the synchronized pounding of the guitar and organ  'Cicatriz ESP' is most notable for it's extremely long instrumental break.  The minimalist stuff in the very middle isn't so interesting, but the dense, weaving solos are quite nice.  The core of the song is excellent, with some of the finest, most memorable vocal lines on the album, and a very powerful chorus.  'This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed' has lots of punky energy, particularly in the hypnotic chorus, but the real best part is the middle break, with a sad and beautiful dual guitar line giving way to some intense, slow building vocals. (Cedric's shrieking, `And now it won't be long' is one of the most powerful moments on the album.  'Televators' is a ballad, and an excellent one, with some nice acoustic guitar and lots of genuine emotional power.  'Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt' closes the album.  It's got another extended middle break, which sounds pretty good, though it doesn't seem to be completely appropriate to the song.  The core of the song is probably most intense and powerful one on the album, and it comes to a devastating, closing section.<br /><br />Normally I don't go for arty gibberish in the lyrics, but they do it pretty well.  Not that I give a damn about the lyrics, in the big picture.  The artwork is pretty nice too.  Yeah, this album rules.  Fans of ATDI should like this.es.  Fans of ATDI should like this.
B0002CTSW2|1.0|The film was like having a ringside seat in the Torture Chamber. The gruesome graphic detail becomes so unreal, no man (including the human Son of God) could ever survive. Theologically unsound: the penalty to be paid for the world's Sin was death of the Christ - not His everlasting torture. The Resurrection merits a two minute post-script, hardly an appropriate balance for Easter which is still part of the Passion. Mel Gibson is clearly working through some personal faith issues in this film, I'm just saddened that he paints Chritianity with unrelenting, harrowing and sadistic pleasure.
B00005JLKN|5.0|It is odd that the third best of the 'Lector' novels written by Thomas Harris should turn out to be every bit as good as the others when taken to film.  Much is due to Brett Ratner's ability to stay focused on creating an unselfconscious story line that sticks to the material and the atmospherics around it.  Another large amount is due to Anthony Hopkins ability to recreate a character who exudes evil and fear.  But the entire cast of this film manage to play their parts well.<br /><br />This is the prequel (or near prequel) to the events in Silence of the Lambs.  Edward Norton plays Will Graham, the FBI agent who brought Lector to justice in the first case.  He has 'escaped' from seeking serial killers and is now making an anonymous life repairing boats.  But his retirement is short-lived as Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) seeks Will out for help on a troubling case where entire families are being killed in a grim ritual.  As we quickly find out, one of the things that's wanted is for Will to work with Lector again, this time with the mad psychiatrist behind thick plate glass and bars.<br /><br />What we find out early in the film is that the new killer is somehow linked to the old.  Lector's uncanny ability to reach out and manipulate minds is still strong, and the real story is Will Graham's struggle to evade Lector's plans while trying to identify the killer with Lecter's help.  The detective and his family are the goats in a dark hunting game.<br /><br />Hopkins plays Lecter to perfection.  Not the slick Lecter of Silence, but as a man still developing his style.  For all his ego, Lecter's real problem is his inability to see Will Graham as anything but an alter-ego.  The agent, who survived catching Lecter only by accident has no such self-delusions.  His honest brilliance is a counterpoint to Lecter's deviousness.<br /><br />Another near perfect acting Job is done by Ralph Fienne, who plays Francis Dolahyde, the Red Dragon of the title.  This isn't a hysterical portrait.  Dolarhyde has his own brilliance despite his emotional ineptness, and Fienne brings this out perfectly, capturing Dolarhyde's fumbling love affair with Reba and his power as a controlled killer with surprising sympathy.<br /><br />The extras consist of commentaries, interviews and the usual 'making of' film.  I tend to look askance at the modern habit of expanding the credence of a film by piling on self-important tidbits, but these are well done, and enhance the viewing experience by surfacing some of the fine details that make this a successful film.sterical portrait.

0143034901|5.0|If you enjoyed Katherin Neville's The Eight, Charles Palliser's The Quincunx or Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, make space on your shelf for this one. The Shadow of the Wind is one of those books that is both well-written and, yes, shamelessly entertaining. If you are looking for Gabriel Garcia Marquez, look elsewhere, but if you want a book that will transport you into another space and time, then read this one. Much, much more fun than any of Perez Reverte's books (the characters are more likeable).
6301969588|2.0|Having read all the wonderful reviews of \\"Freaks\\" I just had to get it.  I warned my wife before we watched that the film was (allegedly) incredibly disturbing, grotesque and frightening.  Let's just say that we didn't even bat an eyelash.  Don't get me wrong--it's a very interesting movie.  But scary?  No way!  Yes, the use of actual \\"freaks\\" in the movie was fascinating, but it surely didn't make us run for the OFF switch on our DVD player.  Considering the reviews, the movie was actually quite tame.  Really tame.  I am frankly shocked it was allegedly banned anywhere at any time.  Weren't circus sideshows more prevelant in the 1930's than now?  So what's the big deal?  I agree that the DVD commentary was excellent, but this was NOT a scary movie.  A good film, unique (that's for sure), and overall enjoyable to watch.  But I don't see it as a landmark horror flick.  Not even close.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite For Destruction (1987.), Guns n' Roses' first studio album<br /><br />Appetite For Destruction, Guns N' Roses 1987 debut is one of those albums that should be in any person's record collection, no question. In my opinion, this is the greatest debut album of all time (even more so than Led Zeppelin I or Hendrix's 'Are You Experienced') and furthermore, is one of the greatest albums of ALL TIME.<br /><br />Guns N' Roses, in many ways, reinvented heavy rock/metal in the few albums that they actually made and this is their finest example. The album simply does not contain one remotely weak track - each song just has that unsurpassable energy, passion and uniqueness. Saying that, if you scorn any lyrics/themes of an explicit nature, then this album is NOT for you. However, this is by no means a negative on the album as in many ways that was what this band were all about. Many of the lyrics may seem pretty strong in that respect (in some of the tracks at least) but it was the band's way of getting across their message on loads of issues and anyway isn't a realistic approach the best way?<br /><br />So the tracks themselves. There are a number of tracks on the album which most people will know. 'Welcome to the Jungle' is one of these, a great album opener with Axl Rose screaming in his familiar protesting manner which characterises the GnR sound. A similar theme to this is seen in 'Out ta get me' - another great track - i'm sure Axl Rose will be still telling us he's 'innocent' for decades to come! 'Paradise City' is one of the really well known 'anthem' style tracks which GnR produced. I personally think its a little overrated, its still brilliant and surges to a great climax at the end. 'Sweet Child O' Mine' though deserves all of the credit it is given - fantastic lyrics coupled with some killer guitar work from Slash make this one a classic.<br /><br />So, the above are the tracks which most people will know - however, the other 8 tracks the album has to offer are just as good, if not better and deserve just as much credit in my opinion. 'Your Crazy' and 'Mr. Brownstone' are songs that may need a few listens to appreciate but they are both powerful in their own way. 'Rocket Queen' is by far the most underrated track on the album and is my personal favourite song on Appetite. It builds up perfectly and the guitar work at the end is brillaint. 'Its So Easy', 'Nightrain', 'My Michelle' and 'Think About You' are all great hard rocking tracks too which again show GnR doin metal at its best!<br /><br />This album may be 18 years old but when you listen to it, it has that sound to it that makes it seem as though it was made yesterday (although it is light years better than most current music!) This album certainly broadend my passion for classic rock. Listening to this showed me that all of the greatest albums were NOT just made in the late 60's and early 70's as I had previously thought. Appetite is up there with the best. There will always be people who knock this band, calling them a bunch of wifebeaters and subsequently refusing to listen to them or those who see them as a band who are just redoing what previous groups had done just at a later time. All I can say is do not listen to any of these criticisms because you will be dismissing a truly great album which holds a deserved high place in rock history. This is one of my favourite albums and i'm sure I'm not the only one who says this!<br /><br />Not bad for a debut ...........and deserve just as much credit in my opinion.

B000002U82|5.0|One night as I was going through my dad's LP collection last year, I stumbled upon this album. I knew that there was a lot of hype surrounding it, and at the time I was mostly into Zeppelin.  I set it on the turntable and was simply blown away. Firsly, let me state that the sound quality of this album is undeniably the best I've ever heard on any recording, be it LP or CD. Alan Parsons is a genius, and the new 16-track equipment at Abbey Road didn't hinder, either.  The album starts out with a heartbeat, the same way it ends. It gets louder and louder until Speak to Me ends and Breathe comes in, with Gilmour's lap-steel and Waters' bass. This eventually melds into On the Run, with Wright on the new VCS3 with a sequencer they had obtained at the time. The repetitive synth riff keeps time while various effects are added in. When I listen to On the Run, I feel as if I am in a train station running alongside a train.  On the Run eventually leads to Time, starting out with the trademark alarm clocks and short drum/guitar intro. The lyrics tell of how one shouldn't waste time, as life is only so long. The solo is compact, but very expressive. The organ work on this piece of good, but Wright still has some more tricks up his sleeve with The Great Gig in the Sky, featuring Doris Troy's vocal solo and some excellent piano work.  The Great Gig in the Sky leads to Money, with its signature bassline and cash register sounds. The time change is also very intriguing. It's not hard to see why this became a hit, although it is ironic that the song describes exactly what it made Floyd.  Then side A is over (or just a pause if you have the CD) and   Us and Them comes in with an organ/piano intro and sax piece, gradually leading to the lyrics. This song describes war and how it only ends up causing everlasting problems in the form of death and destruction, and how the heat of the moment leads to fatal mistakes (\\"and who knows which is which, and who is who?\\").  Us and Them ends and quickly transitions to Any Colour You Like, with absolutely breathtaking synthesizer work. Gilmour's guitar and Mason's drums aren't too shabby, either. Ending with more synthesizer riffs, the classic Brain Damage takes the center stage, talking about insanity and how \\"if the band you're in starts playing different tunes, I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.\\" Brain Damage ends with yet another synthesizer tune, and goes into the grand finale Eclipse, showcasing Wright's Hammond organ and ends with the classic line: \\"there is no dark side of the moon really; matter of fact, it's all dark.\\"  All in all, this is a must-have for anyone who appreciates music. I find that I cannot listen to only one track; I usually end up starting the whole thing over as this album is really just one big song. Waters, Gilmour, Wright, Mason, and even Parsons deserve a medal for their work on this masterpiece.
B000268QB2|5.0|Hopes and Fears is incredible!  I am completely addicted to this CD...cannot stop listening!  What makes Keane's sound so alluring is the combination of Tom Chaplin's incredible voice, the band's choice of piano over the usual guitar, and the poetic depth of all their lyrics. I highly recommend this CD!
0385474547|4.0|<br />The story things fall apart by Chinua Achebe is about the Ibo people of Africa and specifically Okonkwo's family. In the story missionaries come and set up a church and eventually imperialism. Imperialism is The policy of extending a nation's authority by territorial acquisition or by the establishment of economic and political domination over other nations. The imperialism that was instilled in the Ibo people had a negative effect on the people of the tribe. There are many reasons why the imperialism was bad for the tribe one example is the resistance that some of the tribe had and the openness that the other half of the tribe had against change. \\"The new religion and government and the trading stores were very much in the peoples minds. There were still many who saw these new institutions as evil...\\"(pg 182-3). Another example is that it tore families apart \\"How could he have begotten a son like Nwoye, degenerate and effeminate? Perhaps he was not his son.\\"(pg 153 ) <br />
B00078XGRO|2.0|Looks like a great package for fans, but I've got real problems with this movie, given that they had 2 years in which to make it. <br /> <br />The teaser advert I saw on television looked suspenseful and gripping, and even gritty - all things I love.  Of course, it used music from The Wrath of Khan (which was an instant 'red flag' for me), but I didn't let it distract me.  I was hyped and eager to see this new film. <br /> <br />So, I went to the theatre to watch this flick...  didn't feel I needed to see it again.  (I saw VI 3 times, Generations 2 times, and Insurrection 3 times...  Nemesis 1 time and I nearly walked out, but that's for another review...) But because it was on clearance, I ultimately bought the LaserDisc edition in '99... <br /> <br />The good: <br /> <br />Jonathan Frakes' direction.  He really is good with camerawork.  Especially for the Borg intro, his direction is spot-on and even delivers the goods.  Overall, he's the right guy... but you can tell he had to do a LOT with some material that proved itself to be low quality fluff.  <br /> <br />I'm glad they kept him for Insurrection, an eminently better produced film that, unusually for a Next Gen film, doesn't rely on its established lore and dares to tell a new story rather than feeding fans more of the same...  but I digress. <br /> <br />Picard/Borg subplot:  The Federation is proven right as Picard becomes more and more paranoid and is determined to exterminate the Borg at all costs.  (think of it as a reversal of \\"The Wrath of Khan).  If only the movie spent more time on this aspect, because this was when the movie ditched all of the supposed 'ha-ha' moments and actually try to provide thrills and chills...  The Ruby/Picard confrontation is the zenith of this subplot and it is both sublime and superlative. <br /> <br />Special effects:  They're good.  But by 2005, people will re-visit the movie and think that the effects look cheap.  Then they'll try getting into the plot and some of themmight ask \\"Why did I like this slop?  That's why basing a movie on its effects never works; special effects always become dated.  The plot and characterizations don't. <br /> <br />The bad:  <br /> <br />The Picard/Borg subplot:  Let's figure this out:  The Federaton gives Picard their new flagship and then tells Picard to go play tiddleywinks on the Romulan border just as the Borg invasion commences.  Now if the Federation execs can't trust Picard whenever a Borg dare spouts off the usual dreary dialogue drivel, why give him the supposedly best ship out there?!  Isn't that, well, dumb?   <br /> <br />More intersting is this:  The \\"E\\" is situated at the Romulan border and the Borg strike.  They hear over subspace comm that the Feds are losing.  Picard and Data do their little song and joke and 'disobey orders' and head to Earth.  That's EARTH.  Hardly the neighbor of the Romulan neutral zone.  Even at warp 9.9, it's BOGUS to think for even one attosecond that they'd make it back in time to save the day.  This is very sloppy writing, and we're not beyond the first 10 minutes yet!! <br /> <br />Most interestingly of it all - given the previous statement, how come all the Federation ships instantly obey Picard who breaks orders (with Data being a 2nd rate Spock, no less in an awful so-called humorous moment) to go concentrate their firepower on the one area of the Borg ship? <br /> <br />And for a species that proclaims to be able to rapidly adapt, the Borg keep sending o n l y  o n e  c u b e  to take over the Federation.  Having been in tussle against the Federation before, you think they'd send TWO cube ships and be done with it, but nooooo.  Worse, the usual issue of conveniently being able to kill Borg in one scene, followed by a scene where they adapt, and then later another scene where lo and behold they can kill some more Borg again became tiresome. <br /> <br />Time travel.  How many more times do we need to see a sloppily written way to get everybody back intime.  Even better, with the Enterprise heavily damaged and having its deflector removed, I'd wonder HOW they could get back to the 24th century so easily... <br /> <br />\\"Watch you're future's end\\" says the Queen.  Never mind that the Queen is totally incongrous with what we've been led to believe about the Borg in the past.  Her comment is stupid.  Picard and the gang have already ecounted the Borg and even have lives.  Had this scene been in the 24th century, it might be passable.  But with using time-travel (WHY?  There is no need to except to deliver us the means to add the Zephram Cochrane subplot which is utterly atrocious and pointless), this big phrase of hers loses all meaning because we already know they're going to win.  More sloppy writing, if there hadn't been enough at this point! <br /> <br />The comedy, it shouldn't be called 'humor':  Ever since Trek IV, Paramount seems intent on ensuring every Trek movie gets a huge dose of humor (except for 'Nemesis', which is ironically the biggest joke of them all...).  Guess what?  It ain't funny in this one.  It's so awful, it's even embarrasing in scenes.  This movie was presented to me as being a suspenseful adventure and what we truly got was this farce?!  Oobie doobie this! <br /> <br />The music.  Jerry Goldsmith is not at his best here.  One example is the Borg battle music's intro; it's B-material at best, overly pompous and embarrassing to listen to at worst.  Something about the music doesn't fit the movie.  Goldsmith's done better (namely the first Trek film)  What was wrong with Dennis McCarthy's style?  Or, better yet, why not get Ron Jones to do the music?  Oh yeah, he was fired because his style was too lively and engaging and didn't put people to sleep while watching the show. <br /> <br />Continuity flubs:  They exist in great numbers here.  Non-trekkies won't care because they won't see the goofs.  Trekkies who like the Kirk era WILL care.  (Obviously I prefer the Kirk era, generally, but Insurrection Special Edition hasn't been released yet...)  Fans of the Next Generation will love anything it all regardless. (try to sit through 'Nemesis' and you'll know quickly what I mean...) <br /> <br />Production flubs:  Barclay's toupee and some other trifling bits, there's a surprisingly good scene where Ruby is threatening Picard with a phaser.  He ultimately gets her to stand down, but when she hands him the phaser you can see it light up.  Why didn't Picard die as he did say it was set to kill? <br /> <br />And worst of all:  Cameos from two of Star Trek Voyager's cast for no reason:  The McCoy ripoff hologram doctor... and Neelix minus his makeup in the holodeck ballroom recreation.  Just when you thought that Michael Dorn's butting into Trek 6 was bad enough, now we get two from a far worse spinoff.  (not to dis Mr. Dorn, I rather liked how they were making continuity... and for once not wilfully breaking it, as can be seen in Generations and 1st Contact...) <br /> <br />Along with time travel, other bogus conveniences include how easy it is to turn off the holodeck safety mechanism (which should also mean that when one exits the holodeck, any bullets would also vanish, yes?) <br /> <br />Ultimately?  Go buy \\"Generations\\" instead.  It feels even more like an overlong TV episode, but despite its problems it's at least got the humor part done well.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Let me just write a little prequel to my review. Don't immediately think that I am that corny guy who worships anything Em does. In fact, I think he should be put in jail for what he did on the latest Pac release and G-unit is the worst thing that happened to hip-hop since Vanilla Ice. However, this is a true jewel that should not be slept on.  This is the album that turned Em into a huge sensation that he is now. This is the album, that allows Eminem to release unbelievable crap like \\"Encore\\" nowadays and still have people buying it. This is the album that got me into rap.       Before \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" Em had \\"The Slim shady LP \\" which was alright and his underground LP \\"Ifinite\\" which was pretty good, however lacking the world-famous Slim Shady persona. The Slim Shady LP goes triple platinum and Em becomes an overnight celebrity. This album is the reaction of a young white rapper cornered by fame, a lyrical \\"Up yours\\" to all the critics and other people who threw obstacles in his life path.        But what makes it a masterpeace is the lyrical flow. Em throws jaw-dropping rhymes, mad flavour and phat metaphors on every bar. Whether he is being funny:  \\"Willl Smith doesn't have to cus in his raps to sell records  well I do, so f*** him and f*** you too\\"  or he is dead serious:    \\"When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school  and they blame it on Marilyn ... and the heroin  Where were the parents at? And look where it's at  Middle America, now it's a tragedy  Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty  havin this happenin ...    Em always delivers. The beats are of course tight because of the man behind them (c'mon, Dre even makes Game's CD worth listening).     Of course this album has every church-going catholic across America have his mouth filled with foam. This album is filled with violent images such as killing his wife or raping his mother, but it is because Em dares to exploit the freedom of speech to its fullest. And when he dares he doesn't just do it boldly in order for his album to top the record sales, he incorporates these bold anger-lashing statements in his state-of-the-art rhymes over tight beats.  Unfortunately, we won't ever see or hear Eminem like this. He got stinking ritch after this album and lost his longing for good rhymes or for limit-pushing controversy. Maybe it is for good, because this crafted masterpiece can't ever be outdone not   by Em himself, not by anybody else.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|I think it is rather ironic the editorial reviewer said that he recommended TROY, \\"especially if you've never read Homer's Illiad.\\" It's true, reading the book would only ruin the movie for you. I am not an intellectual snob, nor do I believe that contemporary films shouldn't adapt material, but I do have a problem when it distorts the original intent of the author and especially when it does it poorly. Homer chronicled the duality and the harshness of Greek society in his time and he did it brilliantly. His epic was about the destructiveness of anger and revenge. The Greeks worshipped the gods much as people worship God today, in a variety of ways: some out of love, some to further their own interests, for revenge or to appear pious, but their concept of the gods was woven deeply in the fabric of their consciousness; they had complex relationships with their gods; fraternal, dependent, fearful, resentful and jealous and really was so much part of their culture, it seems completely odd to cut that whole part of their society out- all of it was completely absent from the movie and it flattens the depth of the story. It's like trying to write a biography of Saint Francis of Assisi and removing all references to God.<br /><br />And Brad Pitt's performance is a mute interpretation of Achilles. The Iliad's Achilles was actually extremely verbose, passionate and fractious. Homer was amazing at drawing fully fleshed characters, his stories were exciting adventures and morals for their time.  The Iliad is a great book; Homer's writing just pulls you in. There was no need to edit out so much- for example, the hissy fit between Achilles and Agamemnon which has terrible consequences on the war between Greece and Troy. Yes, it starts with Paris stealing away Helen of Troy, but when the two arrogant, conceited soldiers of fortune, Agamemnon and Achilles fight over their \\"spoils of war\\" from a previous battle, the true impact of their argument sets them and all the vast populace of Greece and Troy onto a path of misery and despair. Agamemnon had divided up the loot from a village he and Achilles had razed and looted and included in Achilles' booty was a woman captured from one of the villages: the maiden Briseis. When Agamemnon is forced to return his ill-gotten gains, he takes back Briseis for himself. Achilles, in a snit, then refuses to help the Greeks in their battle against Troy anymore. Zeus comes to the aid of the Trojans and the Greeks suffer great losses without the leadership of the great Achilles. Also, Achilles' beloved friend Patroclus, takes his place in battle and is killed. Achilles howling in grief over his loss, realises how his anger and petty need for revenge has destroyed so many innocents. The book opens with this comment on how such destruction all came down to one man's anger: \\"Goddess, sing the rage of Achilles, murderous, doomed anger that cost the Acheans countless losses, hurling down to the house of death so many sturdy souls, their bodies made carrion feasts for the birds and dogs.\\" Isn't that amazing?

They then do some of their hits such as 'Substitute' before then doing a version of their 'mini opera' from 1967 called 'A quick one whilst he's away' which is a story about a girl guide being seduced by Ivor the Old Engine Driver - it makes quite an amusing story. They follow this with a brilliant cover of 'Summertime Blues' and then 'Shakin' All Over'. A mammoth performance of My Generation follows this which is basically the hit extended into a 10+ minute jam - its really good entertainment. They finish off with 'Magic Bus' in a lighthearted but great fashion.<br /><br />All in all, the concert the Who gave was fantastic.

0385474547|4.0|Imperialism greatly harmed the Ibo people in the book Things Fall Apart.  The Christians that came tried force the Ibo people to follow their religion and they were very arrogant. In one part of the book the Christians try to tell the Ibo people that their religion was totally wrong and that their own religion was the only right religion and they gave the people no choice of what religion they wanted to follow.  But the Imperialists don't just disrespect their religion they also disrespected the people themselves when they just barged right into there villages and built the own churches and places to stay.  It just seemed like the Ibo people were a lot more peaceful and happy before the imperialists arrived.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|It's not easy to send up a movie style that already rarely takes itself too seriously, but, with some great one-liners and visual gags, Shaun of the Dead succeeds most of the time as both an enjoyable spoof and as a fond tribute to the Romero-esque genre.<br /><br />The characterisation is surprisingly strong and Shaun's (brilliantly played by Simon Pegg) tribulations and hang-ups will elicit nods of recognition from many of us I expect!<br /><br />Some extremely laddish humour, interspersed with wry and often very perceptive observational comedy, ensures continued interest, and the action scenes are genuinely dramatic and effective.<br /><br />Inspired (ironic) choice of soundtrack material too.<br /><br />Huge amount of extras make this great value for money.<br /><br />Not Oscar material maybe, but still a highly entertaining movie, which should appeal to those who enjoy the likes of the Evil Dead 2/3 and American Werewolf in London. Like those movies, Shaun of the Dead is almost certainly destined for similar cult status.
B000005RQT|5.0|In Rock (1970.), Deep Purple's fourth studio album<br /><br />Deep Purple's 1970 release saw the band find what they were to prove themselves to be a master of, classic hard rock. Deep Purple had undergone a lot of change in the previous 6 months/year before this album was recorded. The Mark I (original Deep Purple line-up) which produced 3, to many quite unknown (but not bad) albums was no more. Vocalist Rod Evans and bassist Nic Simper left the band in mid 1969 and the remaining members had to start from scratch. However, the Mark II line up was to rise out of the ashes of the previous line up with massive success over the 1969-1973 which they were together. New vocalist Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover along with the classic guitar playing of Ritchie Blackmore, whizz keyboard skills of Jon Lord and powerful drumming of Ian Paice were to be a winning formula. Their first effort, this one, was to be an excellent hard-rocking starting effort.<br /><br />Deep Purple in Rock is by far one of the heaviest albums of its time with its thick but racy guitar lines, heavy bass and overlay keyboard complexion however this is what gives it great passion and drive and makes it one of the true original 'heavy metal' albums. People often say that Black Sabbath are the godfathers of heavy metal but in my opinion, Deep Purple come very close to their level. It is true to say that this album is not quite as refined as later Mark II works such as Machine Head and Fireball but you can see them approaching these later works with this album. The album itself has a great cover, depicting the band faces set 'In Rock' instead of the US Presidents carved into Mount Rushmore. It often amazes me how this album made very little impression in the US album charts, reaching only #143!!!!! Still it had good success in the UK, reaching #4.<br /><br />This album contains some real heavy tracks with loads of drive. The 25th Anniversary Edition, remastered and put together in 1995 is excellent and is the version of this album to get (it comes with a cd case with imprints of the Mark II bands signatures). The album is greatly expanded on the Anniversary Edition and includes the 'A' side classic, Black Night (the remaster and an unedited remix is available on this CD) - this is a great track known to many - the remix of it is brilliant with an extended guitar solo from Blackmore which rocks hard. Some extra tracks, 'Jam Stew' and 'Cry Free' are included which are good worthy additions. A piano version and remix of 'Speed King' and a 'Flight of the Rat' remix are also available which further enhance the effects of Deep Purples work.<br /><br />So these are the extras on the anniversary edition, what about the actual 7 tracks on the album? All of them are fab, even if they do occasionally have a slightly unrefined edge to them. Speed King is a crashing opener and a true Deep Purple classic - a whilrling guitar opening leads into a track which rather on the lines of a later masterpiece 'Highway Star' which features on Machine Head. Bloodsucker is a heavy follow up with a great aggressive riff - Gillans screaming at the end give the track a piercing but kind of haunting finish. 'Child in Time' is a 10+ minute Deep Purple epic which builds to an epic climax in the middle of the track then cleverly returns to the more thoughtful style shown in the opening part of the track. 'Flight of the Rat' for me is the best track on the album, 7 minutes of metal with some brilliant riffs and some nifty keyboard work from Lord. 'Into the Fire' and 'Living Wreck' follow this and both are heavy rockers, even if they are not stand out songs. 'Hard Loving Man' makes a blasting finale to the album which pounding lines of keyboard and guitar.<br /><br />So, it measures up pretty good. I would never put 'In Rock' alongside Machine Head (which I think deserves 6 stars at the very least!) but still it is deserving of all the praise it gets and of a 5 star rating. What you witness here is, in my mind the true birth of Deep Purple, one of the great heavy rock bands that have graced this earth.

B000002MP2|5.0|I remember receiving my first copy of Dookie for Christmas in 1994 on cassette, and being only ten years old and very impressionable, I got quite a bit of visceral entertainment out of Green Day's music and image. I remember listening to the tape over and over again (so much so that the tape player ate it), all while looking at the \\"dirty\\" cartoons and swear words within the booklet, thinking how cool it all was. At the time, I didn't have much of a musical identity, so I'd like to think of Green Day as one of the bands that shaped me. No doubt, Green Day's major label breakthrough, \\"Dookie,\\" is an influential album. Although critics would never give it as much credit as Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" it has had a similar impact on our culture. For one thing, Green Day are one of the few groups to have survived the 90's and aged with grace -- even outdoing themselves with the acclaimed, award winning \\"American Idiot.\\" Their influence is obvious in countless groups out there today -- although, just as it always goes, the formula got watered down, and half of what your hear today isn't this good. I'm not gonna pretend to be a punk snob, or an elitist of some sort. All I can tell you is that \\"Dookie\\" is a great album. Everyone knows the infamous singles, such as \\"When I Come Around,\\" \\"Longview,\\" \\"Basketcase\\" and \\"Welcome To Paradise,\\" afterall, you couldn't turn on the radio or MTV without hearing them. But \\"Dookie\\" is more than just it's singles. Songs like \\"Burnout,\\" \\"Having A Blast\\" \\"Pulling Teeth\\" and \\"F.O.D.\\" hold up to the same standard set by the more popular tunes. However, the shining moment, and the most mature is \\"Coming Clean,\\" a daring song that gracefully tackles the difficult and awkward subject of homophobia and coming out of the closet -- maybe now you understand why the band is so adamantly against Bush. Who knew an album named after human waste could be so brilliant and stand the test of time so well? Maybe I'm just being biased, because this one of the few albums I bought before hitting puberty that I still enjoy just as much today.  But I'm sure plenty of people can tell you a similar story. Like the title says, it's an important album, but it doesn't take itself too seriously, which means you can enjoy it anytime, anyday.albums I bought before hitting puberty that I still enjoy just as much today.

It has certainly given me the incentive to buy more of Deep Purple's albums both studio and live.rple, one of the great heavy rock bands that have graced this earth.

B00000DOYP|5.0|The very thought of Genesis' 1980 album \\"Duke\\" receiving a considerable amount of hostility is truly unjust and, frankly, ridiculous.  \\"Duke\\", originally released on March 31, 1980, is, in some ways, a transitional record, but here's the thing...  Serious fans realize that Genesis did not suddenly become a \\"pop\\" band overnight--the shift to a less progressive, more \\"pop\\"-ish sound was an extremely gradual one, & that said, a case can very much be made that every Genesis album from 1976 through 1983 are transitional ones.  This album, sonically, is nearly identical to the previous album \\"...And Then There Were Three\\"--both albums featured production by David Hentschel.      To put it a certain way, I think if \\"Duke\\" had been released by an obscure band, it would have an absolutely fanatical cult following.  As it is, it somehow seems to have gotten something of a bad rap with its increasing prominence of Phil Collins in the songwriting department.  However, an album of this caliber can only be supplied by the likes of Banks, Collins, & Rutherford.  If you think this is a straightforward pop-rock record, obviously the only tracks from it that you`re familiar with are \\"Misunderstanding\\" and \\"Turn It On Again\\".      Classify the album however you want though--the bottom line is that this is a masterpiece.  Tony Banks' compositional brilliance is in serious abundance on this album, displaying why he is so widely admired by so many progressive rock fans.  Vocally, Phil is in a weirdly transitional phase on \\"Duke\\"--his vocals are expressive & powerful, yet throughout the album, there's a `little guy' humbleness to his vocals, something that, strangely, was almost completely washed away even by the time of Phil's debut solo album \\"Face Value\\" from early the following year.  Listen to Phil's vocals on Tony's gloomy, soothing, and dreamy ballad \\"Heathaze\\", or on Mike Rutherford's slightly weepy, yet soulful, soaring ballad \\"Alone Tonight\\", and you'll see what I mean--you never really heard that timbre from Phil ever again.  It's almost as if after this album was completed Phil got an extra shot of testosterone.      Also, I want to point out the drumming.  Phil's crisp, fluent drumming on here, which is brilliantly captured in the mix, is incredible.  I'm not exactly sure about the chronology, but I *think* the recording of \\"Duke\\" came just before Phil, along with Hugh Padgham and Steve Lillywhite (while working on the third \\"Peter Gabriel\\" album), hit upon the gated \\"In the Air Tonight\\" drum sound that was soon to become a trademark of his.      The album opens with \\"Behind the Lines\\", which has an exciting, fast-paced 2+ minute instrumental intro before the wonderfully melodic, mellower song portion begins.  \\"Duchess\\" also starts off with a 2+ minute instrumental portion which features atmospheric drum machine, washes of guitar, and ethereal keyboard chord changes from Banks--it's really beautiful, and it builds into the main song portion which has soaring Phil vocals, singing a haunting tale about the rise and fall of a female singer.  Rutherford's \\"Man of Our Times\\" is an anthemic song loaded with catchy riffs that explodes out of the speakers/ headphones--it features searing vocals from Collins that, strangely, are majorly buried in the dense mix.      The two hit singles are terrific as well.  \\"Misunderstanding\\" (which is indeed highly reminiscent of Sly & the Family Stone's \\"Hot Fun in the Summertime\\") is a sophisticated, yearning mid-tempo love song.  And \\"Turn It On Again\\" has an ultra-catchy Rutherford guitar riff, and it's sort of a feel-good tune, but with a highly contemplative feel to it.      Phil also delivers a really hard-hittingly emotional ballad with \\"Please Don't Ask\\", a track which strongly underlines how unfair the criticism Phil has received about his songwriting over the years really is.  Listen to the chord changes and the elegant shifts of key that masterfully intertwine with the lyrics of the song, heightening its emotional impact.      Genesis bring closure to the album in emphatic fashion with the multi-part, mostly instrumental \\"Duke's Travels\\" which really takes you on a musical journey, and it segues into the last track, \\"Duke's End\\", which is a reprise of the intro to \\"Behind the Lines\\".      All that said, calling this album a sellout pop-rock simply doesn't pan out.  \\"Duke\\" is an album that offers a wealth of astonishing musicality, masterful use of dynamics, and brilliant composition.  I've been listening to \\"Duke\\" since I was a kid, and my understanding, respect, and admiration of it has only grown since then.  And with so much emotionally resonant music here, it's an album that can go a long way to help pull you through the dark phases of your life as well.  If you've got a serious love for music, you can't go wrong with this stunning must-have album.    (P.S.  One gripe I have with both this CD version and the later \\"original recording remastered\\" version is that the track mark dividing \\"Dutchess\\" & \\"Guide Vocal\\" was improperly inserted--that bit you hear at the beginning of track 3 is actually the closing portion of \\"Dutchess\\", not the intro to \\"Guide Vocal\\".)
B0001Z363W|5.0|OK, I read some of the negative reviews and I must say, they are wrong... so very wrong.  Zakk Wylde is probably one of the most talented musicians out there... I can think of very few modern guitarists that would come close.  Hangover Music solidifies Zakk as a musician by showing his depth.  This is clearly an exemplary piece of work becuase of the depth involved.  True that it is certainly a change from some of his other music, it is clearly a different kind of punch than what Stronger than Death or The Blessed Hellride offer.  I consider this to be one of the best pieces of music I own.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Twain's first greatest hits collection provides exceptionally generous coverage of her hit-making career, with 17 top-charters and three new songs, including her recent single, \\"Party of Two.\\" And though Twain's songs don't always hold up under critical scrutiny (banal lyrics like \\"take a trip, take control, take advice from someone you know,\\" abound), there's no doubting the exceptional quality of these catchy radio gems.<br /><br />Together with producer/husband Mutt Lange, Twain has fashioned a sound that is like highly lacquered wood - plenty of eye-catching gloss with little exposed grain. Their lyrics speak of personal empowerment and minor disappointment, but never ford any real heart-wrenching waters. This is a canny move for creating radio hits, but it's not nearly as compelling across a 21-track album. Similarly, Lange's production choices, the fiddle sound and harmony stylings, are like ear candy for a few tracks, but become cavity-inducing sugar by mid-CD.<br /><br />Unusually, the tracks are presented in reverse chronological order, painting a sonic picture of Twain moving from the MOR pop and dance music of \\"Up!\\" to the twangier country sounds of \\"The Woman in Me.\\" The drum  machines, synthesizers and ZZ Top-like guitar finally give way to acoustics, dobro and harmonica on track 12, \\"No One Needs to Know,\\" and the coy vocal of \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under\\" is supported by compelling close harmonies and tinkling honky-tonk piano.<br /><br />New tracks include two versions of the call-and-response duet \\"Party For Two,\\" one with Billy Currington and one with Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath, the apologetic ballad \\"Don't\\" and the bubblegummy honky-tonker, \\"I Ain't No Quitter.\\" There's no disputing that Twain and Lange make superb music, and that Twain is a compelling vocalist. But like many sweets, the bulk of their hit catalog is filled with empty calories - a fine treat, but not a musical meal.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|effortless work - rarely do you come across a movie like this - unfortunately they are not nominated for academy awards.<br /><br />Donnie plays with time and space like samurai plays with the sword - poetic dive through time and future events - if you have to buy one DVD this year then please buy this one - after every frame press the pause buttom and try to contemplate on what you just saw - it is like the fractal pictures - you can see through it only when you concentrate.<br /><br />extremely original depictions of a kid going through the events of being a portal in the time loop - so age is immaterial only relative circumstances matter
0385512058|5.0|Keith's personality comes out clearly in this book as he reveals his \\"secrets\\" to becoming better connected.  I learned much from his book, and have already begun implementing his methods in my day-to-day schedule.  In fact, my review of his book is an implementation of his principles.  How?  Because Keith, being human, is reading this review to see how his book is being received ;-).  Through this review I am now being introduced to Keith, whom I have never met before, and will now have the entre to call or email him so I too can be placed into his palm pilot as another interesting person Keith MUST meet (next time he is in NY). <br /> <br />Keith's book has opened up a whole new world to me.  I was once a loner with no friends or human contact.  Now, I am a successful owner of a multi-national company with jet setting friends throughout the world.  I never thought it could be possible, but Keith has unlocked this new world for me, and he can do it for you too.  You too can be invited to all kinds of intimate gatherings and meet other interesting people, just like me!  It really is as simply as Keith said it would be.  The phones and emails just won't stop ... Mr. Kissinger, no, I am sorry but I must pass. <br /> <br />Obviously I am kidding some; of course I would do dinner with Henry.  President Clinton will need to wait a bit (I get to call him Bill, although sometimes he makes me call him President Bill). <br /> <br />But seriously, buy the book.  Keith really does explain how to work the crowd and you will take away plenty from the read. <br /> <br />(No people were harmed, nor any parties crashed during the writing of this review.  The characters expressed herein are not real; they are reenactments of the author's new lifestyle developed after reading Keith's book)
0767817478|3.0|To me this film is a-ok. I like Godzilla's new appearance. Much better than his cornball, kiddy- appealing old one. Also, Godzilla in ths film exists independently of those in the old Japanese series. This is not a sequel to the Japanese Godzilla films, people. It is a self-contained movie. There's no inconsistency between this and previous Godzilla films. And this film has subplots (one poster said it didn't).
B000066NW0|5.0|Before i begin my review, I'd like to take a stab at all the lame asses who accuse avril of being a fake punk, a sell-out, or my personal favorite, a poser. You're the same miserable f**ks who think its still 1979, and in between \\"rockin' out\\" to your favorite \\"clash\\" or \\"ramones\\" CD, you find time to sample the latest s*it trend emo/screamo-rock and call yourselves \\"underground\\". if avril isn't your style, then fine, leave it be. But to come in here and talk about how its fake punk and poser music is a joke. Being a poser means that you pretend to be part of a scene that no one wants you in. Its Kinda like all you s*its who sit around in your million dollar homes, listening to your Ipods, all while pretending to be  rebelious \\"punk rockers\\". Heres another newsflash: AVRIL NEVER CAME OUT AND SAID SHE WAS \\"PUNK\\". She might have been inspired by former punk rock acts, but I never heard her once say that her music was similar to the sex pistols, ramones ect. So give it a f**kin rest already.  <br /> <br />As for the CD, its real good. Tons of catchy song, with my favorite being the bass heavy \\"complicated\\". For fans of any good music.

A perfect donor match, Anna's cord cells would be used and there would be no damage to the newborn.  As the the next 13 years, however, Anna must submit to countless invasive procedures in order to donate platelets, stem cells, and bone marrow to save her sister and best friend.  When Kate requires dialysis as a result of kidney failure from the transplant, Anna is asked to donate one of her kidneys.

The characters are well-written human beings, with normal imperfections, not cookie-cutter characters.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I loved this movie from the first time i saw it. the thing about it is that it not only has a lot of action and scares within, but it makes you think beyond the actions. the key to watching this is to not go searching for answers online. watch the movie, wait a week or so and think about it, come up with possibilities, then watch it again, and try to figure out the true answers. awesome movie, the new favorite
B00005JN0T|4.0|\\"I, Robot\\" is a good action film with spectacular special effects aided by superb CG visual effects. As for the story itself, it is a fascinating premise that is acted out in an \\"decent\\" story. Will Smith does some of his best work to date, and Bridget Moynahan is beautiful and engaging. The rest of the cast does as good a job as they can with the slight let-down of a story.<br /><br />Overall, \\"I, Robot\\" is an above-standard action epic. It may not be the greatest action film ever, but it is better than \\"The Day After Tomorrow!\\"<br /><br />The current DVD presents a commentary track and a twelve-minute featurette. A 2-Disc Collector's DVD Edition is coming out in May. I suggest you wait for that one to buy it! It will be more loaded than this DVD!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+
B000002AP1|5.0|From top to bottom one of the best albums I've ever listened to. Raw Power is the perfect title.
B000002LOE|4.0|This album's really good, I think it deserves 4 1/2 stars maybe but I had to give it either 4 or 5 (please fix that, amazon!). <br />It's fun to listen to from the beginning to the end, \\"Losing My Religion\\", \\"Shiny Happy People\\", \\"Texarkana\\", songs like that really make the album worth it. <br />I'll warn you that it's a repetitive album, on the first listen it might seem like the same song was put on there 3 times, but you'll grow attached to it. <br /> <br />Get it if you like R.E.M. or any modern rock, really.
B000000Y27|5.0|Wes achievs the impossible with apparent ease on this one. His chords and octaves and even single line play will continue to be analyzed by guitarists for a very long time. While other guitarists have captured some of the licks-  none of them have accomplished the Wes Montgomery approach to guitar.
B000002KO1|5.0|The Pretenders' debut album is a really good album. It has lots of punk elements in it, which I didn't expect after hearing \\"Pretenders- The Singles\\" and it also has some more mellow songs that are really good. I don't have a whole lot to say about this cd, but if you own Pretenders- The Singles you should definately buy this so you can hear what the band \\"really\\" sounds like. <br /> <br />If you like 80's rock or if you like Punk this is for you.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I have a few concerns, not about the wonderful movie \\"Peter Pan\\", but of the comments that it has recived.  <br /> <br />First off,  there have been quite a few reviews on how poorly Jeremy Sumpter's (Peter Pan) acting went. No, he is not British, but I think he did a magnificent job anyways. It didn't come across my mind once until it was brought up here that he didn't perform well because he was an American boy playing the part of a British boy. I think he did an excellent job and they probably wouldn't be able to find a better Peter Pan for the movie. Also, someone said a while back, that another reason he didn't shine was because of his slightly noticable lisp. Can he help that he was born with a very small lisp?? No, he cant, so I wouldn't hold that against him. That is what makes him so cute to watch. <br /> <br />The second thing I noticed is lots of people complaining on how badly Tinkerbell was potraied. I think she did an amazing job. How else would we be able to get the message about exactly how she was feeling? Yes, she may have overacted some parts, but they were only minor.  <br /> <br />Third was how \\"Peter Pan\\" was getting bad reviews because of the previews? Just because you may not like the movies being previewed, doesn't make \\"Peter Pan\\" a horrible movie. <br /> <br />Forth, there have been lots of people dislikeing the \\"romantic\\" parts in this movie. One person said how Peter and Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood) both looked at Peter's \\"mid-chest\\", then looked at eachother and smiled. Umm, did you not notice what excatly they were doing? They were getting ready to dance. Peter hadn't really danced before, so when Wendy put her hand on his shoulder, he put his hand on her waist. They both looked at his hand, not his \\"mid-chest\\" as this person calls it. Also, I find the kiss to be very sweet. Kids between 2 and 8 or so wont really understand the so called \\"sexual tension\\" through out the movie. The kids will be focusing on the movie in a way that will get their imagination flowing, not how Wendy \\"wants\\" Peter.  <br /> <br />This movie is my favorite movie. The way Neverland was introduced really took me by suprize, but in a good way. The acting was magificent and touching.I dont see how people can say this movie is boring, or too long. It's just right. The soundtrack, though I have yet to buy it, is incredible and really makes your imagination soar. I reacomend \\"Peter Pan\\" to anyone who is willing to become a kid again, if only until the credits roll!! I would give this movie 10 stars, but I can only go up to 5!!!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Those people who so 'tastefully' gave negative ratings to this amazing epic album are simply purists who have attention spans equivalent to that of a 6 year old. The fact that Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays even fathomed writing such an expansive piece of music in the year 2005 shows that their minds are thinking fresh in a world of American Idol and Lou Pearlman. I saw this album performed from beginning to end on The Way Up tour, and it was played right on, note for note, all 68 minutes of it. The musicianship on this album is unrivaled and if you have any sense of what great contemporary jazz is you will love this album from beginning to end.

0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe was an interesting read that really opened up my eyes to the abuse of Africans during the Europeans acquisition of Africa. It proved to be an easy read but one that really drove its opinion into you. An example of this would be how the book demonstrates how the white men tore apart the Africans culture and families with the catholic religion and eventually started slowly wiping out the Ibo religion. This demonstrates Achebe's opinion on the white mans arrival.  <br />I believe Inperialism harmed the Ibo people because Imperialism forever changed the Ibo culture. The Ibo people were surviving fine before the white man came, but after the white man came it tore apart their families and many Ibos died at the hands of the white man for crimes that were allowed in their culture. An example of this is when Okonkwo's son Nwoye joined the Catholics and was disowned by his father for it. Even if some of the Ibos traditions were morally wrong, which is just our opinion anyways, the white men still have no right to go in and destroy their culture and instill theirs. <br />After reading Things Fall Apart I now have a different opinion on Africans and the way Europeans treated them. Now I can better relate to the feelings and opinions of the Africans after reading this book. I have been changed by this book and strongly recommend it.  <br />

B0000A1RJI|5.0|I love this soundtrack. It's the first soundtrack that really has caught my attention akin to my experiences with John Barry's ENIGMA or John William's AMISTAD scores. I mean I just had to go out and buy the soundtrack after seeing the movie leaving the theater. This soundtrack is very good and sounds very rich and dynamic. Track 4 \\"Will and Elizabeth\\" and track 15 \\"He's a Pirate\\" are rousing and very moving and I just enjoy listening to them repeatedly. Other sections of this soundtrack are eerie and have a great mystical quality about them. It is very good. I just wonder how much involvement Hans Zimmer had with this recording.
B0000025DV|5.0|The Electric Light Orchestra were totally in their element when they released their classic 1977 double album, \\"Out Of The Blue.\\" This is a super album with many great ELO tunes, and it successfully sustains itself for over 70 minutes without once ever lagging. Frontman Jeff Lynne came up with a great wealth of material for this one, including such classics as \\"Turn To Stone,\\" \\"Sweet Talkin' Woman\\" and \\"Mr. Blue Sky,\\" but also such gems as \\"It's Over,\\" \\"Night In The City,\\" the light piano funk of \\"Starlight,\\" the rhythmic \\"Jungle,\\" \\"Standin' In The Rain,\\" the beautiful \\"Big Wheels,\\" the dreamy instrumental \\"The Whale,\\" and the rockin' \\"Burmingham Blues.\\" The songs are all very catchy, the orchestral flourishes throughout are suitably lush, and the album's production is sparkly (and dig that album cover artwork, especially on the inside). There are those who say that \\"Out Of The Blue\\" is too over-the-top, i.e. that a double dose of ELO's symphonic pop-rock is a little too much to take. All I can say is this: either you like ELO or you don't. If you DO like ELO, than \\"Out Of The Blue\\" will fit the bill in your CD collection just fine. It's one of the band's greatest works, and I guarantee you'll love it. (NOTE: there's a tracking error on the \\"Out Of The Blue\\" CD, as the song \\"Standin' In The Rain,\\" which should be track 10, has been mistakenly tacked on to the end of track 9, which is \\"Steppin' Out,\\" so you'll have to cue up \\"Steppin' Out\\" and fast forward to the 4:39 mark if you want to immediately get to \\"Standin' In The Rain.\\" Just thought you should know!)
0060925000|5.0|So many novels these days contain one dimensional preachy characters speaking unbelievable dialogue. <br />Seth manages to create an entire cast of characters that without exception sustained my interest throughout the course of this very long novel. He is just great at writng dialogue. <br />I can't find enough good things to say about it. <br />Note: I do not recommend An Equal Music. I can't believe that it was written by the same author.
B00006F83Y|5.0|To me I believe this album is probably the greatest in the world. It led me to buy their past two albums and this album has made me a hardcore fan of theirs. They are probably my favorite band. Joshua Homme on most of the vocals is just brilliant, Dave Grohl and his magnificent drum playing, Mark Lanegan with his voice made only for this album, Nick Oliveri and his great singing and great playing on the bass, and Troy who makes those crazy but essential noises with the guitar. This album truly is a live changer...

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is exactly what they say...unclassifiable.  This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again, and still find something new to think about...and the thinking will be intense.  Just when you think you know what's going on in this movie, you think about it again and gain an entirely new perspective on just what you thought was going on.<br />I do think that the director's cut leaves a little less to the imagination by giving peeks into the book involved in the movie, but it's not a major negative.  It's just that I thought that the original version had my brain twisted for a month after watching it over and over again. So there's some bias involved there.<br />If you want to watch a movie that will force you to think about philosophy, religion, science, etc., AND entertain you by being a mixture of sci-fi/comedy/teen angst/drama type of movie, then you should definitely check this one out.  I've suggested it to many friends, and most of them, after watching it a few times, have come to the same conclusions.<br />Bottom line, if you like movies that challenge the way you think about life, God, etc., whatch this.  If not, then...don't.  Because it will give you a headache.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is one of those movies you will either love or hate, because it consists entirely of a certain kind of deadpan humor that involves setting up the most bizarre, stupid situations ever and having its characters act in really strange ways, but never once acknowleging its a joke. It has no plot and no characters who serve as anything but jokes. <br /> <br />So it comes down entirely to whether you like the type of humor in it. My advice: watch the first 15 minutes, and if you haven't laughed really hard a couple of times by then, then don't bother, because you'll hate it. If this is your kind of humor though, you will love this movie. Like I did.
B000089RV6|5.0|Together with the first album after the death of Bonn Scott they created one of my all-time favourite songs &#8220;Back in Black&#8221;. This song still rocks after 20 years and when I hear the &#8220;Hells Bells&#8221; that gives me the creeps every time. The other songs are quite good. This remastered version gives you nearly the feeling like enjoying AC/DC live.  <br />So even if you have the original album buy this one, too, you won&#8217;t rue it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Twenty years from now, when rock critics look back on the 90's, I'm pretty sure Radiohead will be regarded as the best band of the era.  In terms of influence, only Nirvana could make a serious claim for being more important. In terms of quality, consistent inventiveness and sheer musicianship, nobody comes close. They are, in a very real sense, the greatest band in the world. <br /> <br />And this is their best album. Or, this is their most important album, and the one that will probably define them as a band years down the line. Nirvana had Nevermind, Pink Floyd had Dark Side of the Moon and Radiohead have OK Computer. <br /> <br />It is not possible to be a serious fan of rock music in this day and age and not know this album. It is required listening, so its a good thing that it is every bit as great as it is cracked up to be. Every song could be the standout track on any other album, but here they work to complement each other, adding up to a work that is much more than the sum of its (considerable) parts.

6305308659|5.0|I feel I have to write a defense of this film after reading some of the outraged comments below.  It's like a conservative knee-jerk reaction - and these reviews are missing the most important things about this film. <br /> <br />Yes, it seems ridiculous that all these kids in Pleasantville are suddenly having sex to 50s rock-n-roll, and that does seem like pandering to the \\"coolness\\" of today's social mores.  But what's most effective about the film is the way Bud realizes that the black-and-white world he used to escape to on his television screen is an entirely meaningless form of existence.   He's deemed a hero in Pleasantville, not for blowing away the \\"bad guys\\" (which I suppose is a more typical kind of Hollywood answer that would have pleased the conservatives), but for making them see their own hypocrisy - the hypocrisy that they're living in a fantasy world.  Bud learns that deep questions of morality are rarely posed in black and white, and so this is a coming-of-age film as his road to maturity involves first learning that it falls to him to be the one to make important value judgements (rather than resorting to some black-and-white simplicity) but he also has to get others to realize that they must do so too. <br /> <br />What's beautiful about this film is not the celebration of the fact that a father returns home every day at the same time with a \\"hi honey, I'm home\\" and his wife is there to greet him.  Instead, it's the realization that life will not always work out that way, and to appreciate it more when it does not because its expected, but because it's based on meaningful choices that people make.  (Hence the very end of the film: Bud's \\"Pleasantville\\" mom is left with a choice - and we never learn what she chooses.  It's like asking the viewers: \\"what would YOU do?\\") <br /> <br />When Bud returns home at the end, he no longer has any interest in the \\"Pleasantville\\" marathon with its simple black-and-white answers, but instead he finally pays attention to his real mom, whose life is pretty much a mess.  (We aren't told how much of this is her fault.)  Instead of escaping into his own fantasy world, Bud/Dave suddenly realizes how much of a difference he can and does make in her life.  He is wise enough to realize that this sudden meaningful connection he has with his mother is more of a \\"Pleasantville\\" moment than all the reruns he'll ever spend time watching. <br /> <br />I can't think of a better film expression of \\"family values.\\"
B00005JNPZ|5.0|Hitch shows Will Smith at his best - funny, original and at times sophisticated. As Alex Hitchinson (short Hitch), he is the date doctor who shows poor souls how to impress women and treat them well. <br />While helping other men as a 'private consultant', Hitch has to take some of his own medicine when he finds Sara (Eva Mendes). The visually appealing couple hits it off after some smart but sincere moves on the part of Hitch. <br />Without wanting to spoil any of the essential parts of this movie, it's a hilarious flick for guys, girls, couples and just everybody interested in a quick LAUGH that lasts the whole two hours :)) <br /> <br />The dance scene at the end is hilarious. <br />New York looks beautiful in many scenes.
B0006J28BO|2.0|This movie isn't really up to par with Ghibli's other work, but it's still pretty good.  It's really simple and transparent and aimed at kids, but it's not without charm.  Plus, the animation is really something to look at. <br /> <br />However, this item gets 2 stars, because the DVD is messed up.  On all of the other Ghibli/Disney releases, the viewer is given two subtitle choices: one is a closed caption version of the English dub, and the other is a more literal subtitle translation of the original Japanese.  Although this DVD gives the viewer both choices, both subtitle tracks are the same.  They are both closed captioning for the English dub.  This means that if you watch the film in Japanese with subtitles, you get a very inaccurate translation (sometimes you see subtitles without even hearing a line spoken.)  It is incredibly annoying, and if I could, I'd return my copy.  You've been warned.
B000002UAI|3.0|It was inevitable that the constant grind of touring, writing, promoting, and recording would grate on the Beatles, but the weariness of Beatles for Sale comes as something of a shock. Only five months before, the group released the joyous A Hard Day's Night. Now, they sound beaten, worn, and, in Lennon's case, bitter and self-loathing. His opening trilogy is the darkest sequence on any Beatles record, setting the tone for the album. Moments of joy pop up now and again, mainly in the forms of covers and the dynamic \\"Eight Days a Week,\\" but the very presence of six covers after the triumphant all-original A Hard Day's Night feels like an admission of defeat or at least a regression. Beneath those surface suspicions, however, there are some important changes on Beatles for Sale, most notably Lennon's discovery of Bob Dylan and folk-rock. The opening three songs, along with \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party,\\" are implicitly confessional and all quite bleak, which is a new development. This spirit winds up overshadowing McCartney's cheery \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" or the thundering covers of \\"Rock & Roll Music,\\" \\"Honey Don't,\\" and \\"Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!,\\" and the weariness creeps up in unexpected places -- \\"Every Little Thing,\\" \\"What You're Doing,\\" even George's cover of Carl Perkins' \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\" -- leaving the impression that Beatlemania may have been fun but now the group is exhausted. That exhaustion results in the group's most uneven album, but its best moments find them moving from Merseybeat to the sophisticated pop/rock they developed in mid-career . <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|i didnt expect much of the movie from the reviews, but im really glad i did see it. this movie is so beautiful, so colorful, so touching, i loved it!!! my eyes were watery when the movie ended and there was a GUY next to me that was BAWLING!! i swear!! crying his heart out!! the music really does move you. Gerald Butler...you are the only one who could've pulled it off..congratulations!!!
B000002UAF|5.0|Hard Day's Night not only was the de facto soundtrack for their movie, not only was it filled with nothing but Lennon-McCartney originals, but it found the Beatles truly coming into their own as a band. All of the disparate influences on their first two albums had coalesced into a bright, joyous, original sound, filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies. A Hard Day's Night is where the Beatles became mythical, but this is the sound of Beatlemania in all of its giddy glory. Decades after its original release, its punchy blend of propulsive rhythms, jangly guitars, and infectious, singalong melodies is remarkably fresh. There's something intrinsically exciting in the sound of the album itself, something to keep the record vital years after it was recorded. Even more impressive are the songs themselves. Not only are the melodies forceful and memorable, but Lennon and McCartney have found a number of variations to their basic Merseybeat style, from the brash \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"Any Time at All\\" through the gentle \\"If I Fell\\" to the tough folk-rock of \\"I'll Cry Instead.\\" It's possible to hear both songwriters develop their own distinctive voices on the album, but, overall, A Hard Day's Night stands as a testament to their collaborative powers -- never again did they write together so well or so easily, choosing to pursue their own routes. John and Paul must have known how strong the material is -- they threw the pleasant trifle \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance With You\\" to George and didn't give anything to Ringo to sing. That may have been a little selfish, but it hardly hurts the album, since everything on the record is performed with genuine glee and excitement. It's the pinnacle of their early years.
B0002858YS|5.0|Like everyone else, I heard 'Mr. Brightside' & 'Somebody Told Me' on the radio all the time... after a while, I noticed how much I loved 'Mr Brightside'... so the inevitable was going to happen, I knew... it happens to all of us - we buy an album for 1 or 2 songs, only to listen to the rest of the album that's a complete drag ('Maps' from the 'Yeah Yeah Yeah's' album ring a bell anyone?)  <br /> <br />So you could imagine my astonishment when I popped this bad boy into my stero & honestly thought there wasn't one bad song on the entire cd... only good & great songs - I was first dismissing the Killers as another run-of-the-mill 'The' band - but unlike the Hives & the Strokes, these guys can actually write great songs <br /> <br />A lot of people will dismiss the Killers as a rip off of bands in the 1980's... what are you people talking about? why are the Killers rip-offs of bands in the 80's? cus they have KEYBOARDS and SYNTHS?.... so I suppose any band with a guitar then is a rip-off of the Beach Boys or Elvis too? open your minds & start living in the current times... <br /> <br />And quite frankly, this is better than any album ive heard from the Smiths or the Cars (yes, I have heard 'the Queen is Dead' & love it, but I like this better...) - Lets do a rundown, shall we? I wont rate the songs tho <br /> <br />1) Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine - The first track is a very good, catchy alternative track, it's a good way to start the album <br /> <br />2) Mr. Brightside - You've all heard this song & already know how good it is... the 2nd best song on the album <br /> <br />3) Smile Like You Mean It - This song is great... by now, youre realizing this band is more than just a one hit wonder type band... as you can tell by the title, this song is about pretending to be happy <br /> <br />4) Somebody Told Me - A lil played out by the radio... but still a catchy number <br /> <br />5) All These Things I've Done - THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SONGS I HAVE EVER HEARD... it starts out sounding like Queen, but quickly becomes MUCH better when the guitar riff kicks in.. the chorus is unforgettable, & the part where he sings 'I've got soul, but im not a soldier' is incredibly moving & musical.... this is one of the greatest songs ive heard in a long time - & i would glady pay the 20 dollars it cost to get this cd, for this song alone.... this will probably be the 3rd single... & when this song is released, i expect this album to become much more noticed... this song is so emotional, i dont see how anyone could resist <br /> <br />6) Andy, You're a Star - A Slower song, but still very musical...   <br /> <br />7) On Top - This could be my least fav. track on the cd, with that said - it's still a good song <br /> <br />8) Change Your Mind - Another song driven by synths & keyboards <br /> <br />9) Believe Me Natalie - Brandon Flowers' voice sounds sad on this song, as it does on all the others, but you notice it on this one probably more than the others <br /> <br />10) Midnight Show - An upbeat, semi-happy song, makes yah wanna get in your car & drive <br /> <br />11) Everything Will Be Alright - On this song, Brandon's voice reminds me of Ian Curtis' (Joy Division)... & sounds very JD inspired... not a happy way to end a mostly upbeat album, In fact, it's quite depressing... but one of the best songs off the album <br /> <br />______________________________________________________ <br /> <br />To anyone who doesn't like this album, I ask, why? cus you're stuck in the 80's listening to bands that didn't make albums nearly as good as this one? (with the exception of the Cure, of course) & you're upset that a modern band has come along & actually knows how to make synths sound good? -  <br /> <br />I originally thought the Killers were a flashy vegas alternative band.... but a closer listen to them reveals they are, musically, very emotionally driven & sincere sounding... this is exactly what music needs right now.... 4 1/2 stars, but Im rounding it to 5... <br /> <br />the best 'the' band since the White Stripes - If you don't get this album, you're missing out badly... <br /> <br />& no, I am not part of any marketing team that comes to amazon to praise an album to get you to buy it *coughu2cough* (all the other reviews ive written proves that) - I'm just here, as a music lover, to tell you this album is excellent.  cant wait for the sophmore.
B000002KAT|5.0|Astral Weeks is generally considered one of the best albums in pop music history. For all that renown, Astral Weeks is anything but an archetypal rock & roll album: in fact, it isn't a rock & roll album at all. Employing a mixture of folk, blues, jazz, and classical music, Van Morrison spins out a series of extended ruminations on his Belfast upbringing, including the remarkable character \\"Madame George\\" and the climactic epiphany experienced on \\"Cyprus Avenue.\\" Accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, Morrison sings in his elastic, bluesy voice, accompanied by a jazz rhythm section (Jay Berliner, guitar, Richard Davis, bass, Connie Kay, drums), plus reeds (John Payne) and vibes (Warren Smith Jr.), with a string quartet overdubbed. An emotional outpouring cast in delicate musical structures, Astral Weeks has a unique musical power. Unlike any record before or since, it nevertheless encompasses the passion and tenderness that have always mixed in the best postwar popular music, easily justifying the critics' raves.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I honestly believe a lot of the reviewers are being unnecessarily harsh, and are looking at this CD in the wrong way. It's only natural that, as a mix of the Beatles #1 Hits (not necessarily their best songs, but their most popular), it's not going to feel the same, or flow as well, as an album.  Of course, I highly recommend buying \\"Revolver,\\" \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" as ALBUMS, but this compilation presents a lot of great songs, in chronological order of their release as singles.  Take this CD for what it is, and just enjoy the songs on it - in fact, listening to what defined the Beatles' phenomenal popularity and how it evolved over the decade helps provide an interesting historical perspective.  It's a great introduction to the most influential rock band in history, and has 27 fantastic songs on it. I highly recommend it, but don't expect it to provide what an album would.
B000002UYZ|4.0|Assembling a compilation of the Beatles is a difficult task, not only because they had an enormous number of hits, but also because singles didn't tell the full story; many of their album tracks were as important as the singles, if not more so. The double-album 1962-1966, commonly called The Red Album, does the job surprisingly well, hitting most of the group's major early hits and adding important album tracks like \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,\\" \\"Drive My Car,\\" \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" and \\"In My Life.\\" Naturally, there are many great songs missing from the 26-track 1962-1966, and perhaps it would have made more sense to include the Revolver cuts on its companion volume, 1967-1970, yet The Red Album captures the essence of the Beatles' pre-Sgt. Pepper records.
0525457585|5.0|I grew up watching the movie version of the Neverending Story and it quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time, and the theme song to Neverending Story (which I am listening to as I write) is one of my favorite songs of all time.  I did not even know the book existed until I came across it at a school book fair.  I bought it immediately and read it, and it is now one of my favorite books of all time. <br /> <br />It tells the story with a depth and detail that the movie only began to reveal, not so much in the story itself, but the philosophy as well.  I love the entire concept of the story, how the book Bastian takes is essentially a bridge into the boundless world of dreams and imaginations, how the characters can hear him and what he does will determine the fate of Fantasia (Fantastica in the book).  The concepts addressed in the movie appear tenfold in the book.  At some points the book is surprisingly dark and eerie, but brilliant all the same.   <br /> <br />This is book is like no other fantasy I have read.  It is a classic of the genre.  I only wish I had the hardcover edition with the red and green ink and the color plates.  A must-read for anyone who loves the movie or fantasy in general.
B000002UAU|5.0|With Revolver, the Beatles made the Great Leap Forward, reaching a previously unheard-of level of sophistication and fearless experimentation. Sgt. Pepper, in many ways, refines that breakthrough, as the Beatles consciously synthesized such disparate influences as psychedelia, art-song, classical music, rock & roll, and music hall, often in the course of one song. Not once does the diversity seem forced -- the genius of the record is how the vaudevillian \\"When I'm 64\\" seems like a logical extension of \\"Within You Without You\\" and how it provides a gateway to the chiming guitars of \\"Lovely Rita.\\" There's no discounting the individual contributions of each member or their producer, George Martin, but the preponderance of whimsy and self-conscious art gives the impression that Paul McCartney is the leader of the Lonely Hearts Club Band. He dominates the album in terms of compositions, setting the tone for the album with his unabashed melodicism and deviously clever arrangements. In comparison, Lennon's contributions seem fewer, and a couple of them are a little slight but his major statements are stunning. \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" is the ideal Ringo tune, a rolling, friendly pop song that hides genuine Lennon anguish,  la \\"Help!\\"; \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" remains one of the touchstones of British psychedelia; and he's the mastermind behind the bulk of \\"A Day in the Life,\\" a haunting number that skillfully blends Lennon's verse and chorus with McCartney's bridge. It's possible to argue that there are better Beatles albums, yet no album is as historically important as this. After Sgt. Pepper, there were no rules to follow -- rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse. Ironically, few tried to achieve the sweeping, all-encompassing embrace of music as the Beatles did here.
B000002UDB|5.0|On Piper the floyd arguably out LSD'd the fabs Pepper,but with this effort the Beatles hit a psychadelic zenith only a floyd that included Barret could have topped. If you like weird trippy acid induced rock this cd is for you. The Beatles of '67/early '68 were the gods of wierd with not only this but stuff like it's all too much & what's the new mary jane. all this plus maybe the two finest beatles songs ever in strawberry fields forever/penny lane.
B000001FS3|5.0|Using the textured sonics of The Unforgettable Fire as a basis, U2 expanded those innovations by scaling back the songs to a personal setting and adding a grittier attack for its follow-up, The Joshua Tree. It's a move that returns them to the sweeping, anthemic rock of War, but if War was an exploding political bomb, The Joshua Tree is a journey through its aftermath, trying to find sense and hope in the desperation. That means that even the anthems -- the epic opener \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" the yearning \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" -- have seeds of doubt within their soaring choruses, and those fears take root throughout the album, whether it's in the mournful sliding acoustic guitars of \\"Running to Stand Still,\\" the surging \\"One Tree Hill,\\" or the hypnotic elegy \\"Mothers of the Disappeared.\\" So it might seem a little ironic that U2 became superstars on the back of such a dark record, but their focus has never been clearer, nor has their music been catchier, than on The Joshua Tree. Unexpectedly, U2 have also tempered their textural post-punk with American influences. Not only are Bono's lyrics obsessed with America, but country and blues influences are heard throughout the record, and instead of using these as roots, they're used as ways to add texture to the music. With the uniformly excellent songs -- only the clumsy, heavy rock and portentous lyrics of \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" fall flat -- the result is a powerful, uncompromising record that became a hit due to its vision and its melody. Never before have U2's big messages sounded so direct and personal.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|As a fan of both Sci-fi and pulps from the 1930s & 1940s, I was delighted by Sky Captain.<br /><br />Jude Law was probably not the most \\"authentic\\" choice for the types of heros in serials and pulps back then (think DOC SAVAGE and the SHADOW, FLASH GORDEN, etc...).. but did an OK job.<br /><br />The 99% CGI generated world with the Art Deco feel and atmosphere and color filters are fun.<br /><br />Like the Serials and Pulps of the era, the plot is kept simple, the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad... the action is the main theme.<br /><br />Basically SKY CAPTAIN is not to be taken too serious.... it is basically a comic book, Amazing Stories Sci-FI mag and/or a Golden Era Pulp from the 30-40s brought to life.<br /><br />For that I like it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Apparently, there was a gap in the Beatles' catalog, after all -- all the big hits weren't on one tidy, single-disc compilation. It's not the kind of gap you'd necessarily notice -- it's kind of like realizing you don't have a pair of navy blue dress socks -- but it was a gap all the same, so the group released The Beatles 1 late in 2000, coinciding with the publication of their official autobiography, the puzzlingly titled -Anthology. The idea behind this compilation is to have all the number one singles the Beatles had, either in the U.K. or U.S., on one disc, and that's pretty much what this generous 27-track collection is. It's easy, nay, necessary, to quibble with a couple of the judgment calls -- look, \\"Please Please Me\\" should be here instead of \\"From Me to You,\\" and it's unforgivable to bypass \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", but there's still no question that this is all great music, and there is a bit of a rush hearing all these dazzling songs follow one after another. If there's any complaint, it's that even if it's nice to have something like this, it's not really essential. There's really no reason for anyone who owns all the records to get this too -- if you've lived happily without the red or blue albums, you'll live without this. But, if you give this to any six or seven year old, they'll be a pop fan, even fanatic, for life. And that's reason enough for it to exist.
B000683VI4|5.0|Like most guys, I made fun of this movie because of the nature of the movie. But I did hear a lot of people say it was good and looking at the preview, I didn't think it would be that bad, I enjoy dramatic movies when I am in the mood. And this week was one of those long weeks, where misery loves company and so I decided to watch Notebook, hoping to see other people's woe's would make me forget about my own.. and it worked. Skip the next paragraph if you do not want to be spoiled.     The best thing of the movie, was the acting done by the four major actors. Both the older and younger set of actors did a really good job. I remember Ryan from Young Hercules, but more recently Murder By Numbers. He does a complete role reversal in this movie from brooding killer to brooding romantic. The chemistry with him and Rachel was dead on and sold the movie. Rachel also does a great job, and watching it, I was like I saw her somewhere... Mean Girls i later found out. Seeing the broad range of these actors really made me respect them in their craft,  You feel the love Noah has for her, which is mirrored by older Noah, which in turns makes it just as painful n heart retching to watch the later part of the movie. The other great thing of the movie was the story itself, your basic summer fling type of story, its not new but that is only half the plot and the other half makes it all the more interisting and makes tug even more at your heart.  Being a student of health, I was at least familiar with the technical aspects of the disease in the movie, which helped enhance the movie for me and made me really feel for the characters. I wasn't surprised when I started tearing, just surprised that I found myself doing so in more scenes than expected.     other things to mention is the beautiful setting of the movie and the rich supporting cast of actors from noah's dad, to ally's mom and james marsden from x-men. not to mention the musical score.    i have three main quirks with the movie.- in the beg, the movie is set in the south during the summer of 1940. they couldn't digitally remove the cold breathe from the film. it kinda felt more like a late autumn fling, that was more of a technical thing.   - the other technical thing, which isn't that big of deal because it was only in one scene was where you see duke looking through the old photographs. I find it odd that they would use the older actors' pictures instead of ryan and Rachel, which kind of took me away from the characters and made you believe that these are 2 separate couples.  - The last thing is that i wish they would've done more with the political nature of its time. they briefly grazed WW2 and no mention of racism, especially for a film set in the south in the 40's. but in all fairness, that might have detracted from the movie, especially the racism part but you did see the servants as black. but i think we could've used a scene or two more during ww2.     other than that, this is a movie that will stick in you head, it sure did with me, which is why i am writing this. this movie is about love in all shapes in form and the duality of this movie makes it unique from the rest out there. With movies like these, the ending is no big surprise, what makes it is the journey, which I certainly enjoyed the ride.    Edti: I liked the movie so much, I read the book. And... the movie is better. I rented the Notebook, I should've just bought the dvd. I am a little harsh but the book isn't that bad, but I enjoyed the movie a lot more.
B000002UZ1|4.0|Picking up where 1962-1966 left off, the double-album compilation 1967-1970, commonly called The Blue Album, covers the Beatles' later records, from Sgt. Pepper through Let It Be. Like The Red Album, The Blue Album contains a mixture of hits, including singles like \\"Lady Madonna,\\" \\"Hey Jude,\\" and \\"Revolution\\" that were never included on an LP, plus important album tracks like \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,\\" \\"A Day in the Life,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" and \\"Come Together.\\" Like its predecessor, 1967-1970 misses several great songs, but the compilation nevertheless does capture the essence of the Beatles' later recordings.

Will it NEVER end.  It's time for a revolution!!  No more dumb blondes bringing American music to the level of a streetwalker.  It's great that her recordings aren't selling anymore.  Of course there's still the occasional axe-murderer who can get his jollies off Spears while in Prison.
B000002OX7|5.0|Much of Who's Next derives from Lifehouse, an ambitious sci-fi rock opera Pete Townshend abandoned after suffering a nervous breakdown, caused in part from working on the sequel to Tommy. There's no discernable theme behind these songs, yet this album is stronger than Tommy, falling just behind Who Sell Out as the finest record the Who ever cut. Townshend developed an infatuation with synthesizers during the recording of the album, and they're all over this album, adding texture where needed and amplifying the force, which is already at a fever pitch. Apart from Live at Leeds, the Who have never sounded as LOUD and unhinged as they do here, yet that's balanced by ballads, both lovely (\\"The Song Is Over\\") and scathing (\\"Behind Blue Eyes\\"). That's the key to Who's Next -- there's anger and sorrow, humor and regret, passion and tumult, all wrapped up in a blistering package where the rage is as affecting as the heartbreak. This is a retreat from the '60s, as Townshend declares the \\"Song Is Over,\\" scorns the teenage wasteland, and bitterly declares that we \\"Won't Get Fooled Again.\\" For all the sorrow and heartbreak that runs beneath the surface, this is an invigorating record, not just because Keith Moon runs rampant or because Roger Daltrey has never sung better or because John Entwistle spins out manic bass lines that are as captivating as his \\"My Wife\\" is funny. This is invigorating because it has all of that, plus Townshend laying his soul bare in ways that are funny, painful, and utterly life-affirming. That is what the Who was about, not the rock operas, and that's why Who's Next is truer than Tommy or the abandoned Lifehouse. Those were art -- this, even with its pretensions, is rock & roll.

B000000W5P|5.0|By 1978, both punk and disco had swept the group off the front pages, and Some Girls was their fiery response to the younger generation. Opening with the disco-blues thump of \\"Miss You,\\" Some Girls is a tough, focused, and exciting record, full of more hooks and energy than any Stones record since Exile on Main St. Even though the Stones make disco their own, they never quite take punk on their own ground. Instead, their rockers sound harder and nastier than they have in years. Using \\"Star Star\\" as a template, the Stones run through the seedy homosexual imagery of \\"When the Whip Comes Down,\\" the bizarre, borderline-misogynistic vitriol of the title track, Keith's ultimate outlaw anthem, \\"Before They Make Me Run,\\" and the decadent closer, \\"Shattered.\\" In between, they deconstruct the Temptations' \\"(Just My) Imagination,\\" unleash the devastatingly snide country parody \\"Far Away Eyes,\\" and contribute \\"Beast of Burden,\\" one of their very best ballads. Some Girls may not have the back-street aggression of their '60s records, or the majestic, drugged-out murk of their early-'70s work, but its brand of glitzy, decadent hard rock still makes it a definitive Stones album.
B000002N3J|5.0|This is a wonderful compilation of her greatest ballads. I really do not see any of these ballads as weak, if anything they all work together and almost seem harmonizing. Some of my personal favorites are Oh Father, Rain, Something to Remember, and You'll See (although I heard the Spanish version was even better!). But all in all, I think this was a very sentimental and endearing album, different from Madonna's dance tracks but still great nonetheless. I would recommend it to any music listener.
B000002KGT|5.0|The new lineup that Fleetwood Mac successfully unveiled with their eponymous 1975 album became even more successful with the multi-platinum Rumours, which became the band's most celebrated album and one of the best-selling albums of all time. To be sure, this was a very different sounding Fleetwood Mac than the blues-rock outfit of the late '60s. This edition of the band generally wasn't well received by rock critics. But as commercial and slick as Rumours is, the music has a lot of heart and never comes across as insincere. From Christine McVie's optimistic \\"Don't Stop\\" (which President Bill Clinton used as his campaign theme song in 1992) to Lindsey Buckingham's remorseful \\"Go Your Own Way,\\" Rumours is consistently memorable. And the folkish \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" (covered by Courtney Love and Hole in 1996) and the melancholy hit \\"Dreams\\" made it quite clear just how much depth and substance Stevie Nicks was capable of.
B000002LND|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums in my CD collection. These are little and fun pop tunes from the 80s and some of the best of Madonna's. She has so many hit singles that it was hard to include all of them, but I think they did a wonderful job at compiling the best of the best. She has a wide range of ballads to dance hits. This is truly an immaculate collection.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Inspired by a true story that occurred in 1964, Michael Mann's \\"Heat\\" reinvents the police action drama in the story of two men on opposite sides of the law who have respect for each other but, ultimately, must face off because of their roles in society. One a police officer named Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) the other a thief named Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) find they are flip sides of the same coin. McCauley hopes to pull off one big last score. His philosophy of life reflects that of a great thief; don't become attached to anything in life so that you can walk away. Pursued by an obsessed Hanna, he's driven only by the work and pushes his family away and pushes his men to capture McCauley before that last score goes down.<br /><br />A brilliant crime thriller where Mann reinvents the genre inverting the clich&eacute;s of the genre, the secret to \\"Heat\\" is the compelling story of duality that drives the characters and Mann's storytelling style and unconventional narrative that allows audiences to identify with both sides of the conflict. Stylish with rich visuals \\"Heat\\" captures Mann at the top of his game. \\"Heat\\" was, in fact, a remake of a film that Mann made for TV (as a possible pilot for a series). When producer Art Linson read the script he encouraged Mann to produce the original screenplay the way it was meant to be done with a top notch cast.<br /><br />Using the same transfer as last year's bare bones release, \\"Heat\\" looks positively beautiful. Mann's compositions and use of light and shadow immediately pull you into this urban tale of rivals on the opposite side of the law. It appears that this is the same anamorphic transfer that was done for the 1999 single disc release of the film. As with the previous edition the blacks darker than black coffee and the colors are solid. The only thing new here are the extensive extras and Michael Mann's commentary track. The audio makes nice use of the surround sound format placing sound effects all around the room where appropriate.<br /><br />A full disc of extras accompanies the film. Featuring 1 documentary divided into five parts which can be viewed in segments or all together, the first \\"The Making of Heat\\" features interviews with Mann and others from the production cast and crew discussing how Mann originally envisioned \\"Heat\\" (then called \\"L.A. Takedown\\") as the pilot for a TV series. The TV movie that Mann made in 1989 was an abridged version of the final script which, ultimately, became \\"Heat\\".  Mann had just completed writing \\"The Jericho Mile\\" (a TV movie) but no one was likely to approve him directing a major motion picture with the scope suggested by the script. Producer Art Linson read the complete screenplay that Mann had completed and told him bluntly, that it needed to be a feature film. Mann got his first choice for both major roles; both Pacino and De Niro agreed to do the film from the moment they were asked. Pacino discusses that his amped up take on his character was created because he envisioned that Hanna was on cocaine using it to keep him going so he could reach his objective of capturing McCauley. Pacino points out that Hanna is \\"a hunter\\"  and Mann states that he's \\"addicted\\" to complete the journey not so he can reach the end but just for the joy of catching the bad guy. In \\"Crime Stories\\"  the actors and production crew discuss how \\"Heat\\" has elements of a Greek tragedy as these two characters move towards their collision with no way out. Mann was interested in looking at the lives outside the story for each of these characters giving them depth and background.<br /><br />\\"Pacino and De Niro in Conversation\\" discusses the legendary showdown between Pacino and De Niro who meet together on screen for the first time. These two charismatic characters meet briefly in the film and that's the power of their meeting;  delaying their screen time creates tension. Both generate dramatic sparks on screen even though it's a low key conversation as they sharetheir nightmares and their dreams. \\"Return to the Scene of the Crime\\" features the location manager and associate producer who discovered the locations for the film to revisit them and discuss how they found some of the unusual settings for the film.<br /><br />Mann's involving and intelligent commentary track really makes this worth getting by itself. While the documentaries are pretty good, nothing can beat Mann's insightful comments whether it be on Pacino's performance (and the background on the character that we never see but know from the actor's superb take on Hanna) to De Niro's meticulous working methods. It's one of the best solo commentary tracks I've heard.<br /><br />Sporting the same anamorphic widescreen transfer as the previous bare bones release from last year, the extras are what make \\"Heat\\" worthwhile. Mann's intelligent commentary and the second disc filled with documentaries and 11 deleted scenes make this worth picking up. My only complaint is that I wish the film had been released with a \\"L.A. Takedown\\" as a third disc. This would have made this the ultimate \\"boxed\\" set of a classic film. Well worth owning with incredible performances, strong extras and a detailed & thoughtful commentary from director Mann.their nightmares and their dreams. \\"Return to the Scene of the Crime\\" features the location manager and associate producer who discovered the locations for the film to revisit them and discuss how they found some of the unusual settings for the film.<br /><br />Mann's involving and intelligent commentary track really makes this worth getting by itself.

068987474X|5.0|This book is so awesome.. I read it cover to cover in one day!! U just can't put it down.. You can definitely relate to a lot of other ppl's situations...Just by reading it I feel better about some of my ex-boyfriend siutations, it helped reinforce my decisions..It's very imformative to read and helps you learn these stupid games that men play and to figure out what they are actually saying when they do or say certain things.. Def go out and buy this book it's awesome!!!
B000002OMN|1.0|Just when music couldn't get any worse,along comes \\"Bat out of Hell II\\".Great-MORE noise to give you a worse migraine than before.There is NO talent and NO music in this rubbish album-it's just a bunch of noise,noise,noise,noise,noise,noise,noise-and did I mention noise?Meatloaf have proven to the world that he is one of the absolute WORST musicians of all time.DO NOT  waste your money on this album unless you want to get a lifetime prescription of migraine medication.
B0002YLC24|4.0|There is basically 2 reasons why this movie is the perfect sequel.<BR>First: It is not about making money out of a very successful first film. Before Sunrise was not a success, it was an outstanding indie film that captured a rare moment between two persons. Which was an encounter that was very unlikely to happen between an american guy an a french girl while they are travelling. It was about the emergency of knowing the other person because you already know how it will end. The ending was a question that could be answered 3 different ways depending on your cynism or your romanticism. They would never meet again, they might but unlikely or they will definitly end up together. 9 years later the answer is given in Before Sunrise.<BR>Second reason: Every subject that was discussed in the first movie will be reopened by the two of them. The maturity and the desillusionment of both gives a depth to those discussions that were held 9 years before. The first movie add to the second, but the second also add to the first. Before Sunrise is excellent. They talk about pertinent subjects. It isn't about USA versus France nor a man versus a woman, it is about two human beings living in a world of nonsense and trying to find their own way of living happily in it.
B00007BK2N|1.0|Talentless people and garbage music  torture you in this turkey-in no time flat,you'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming \\"MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" out into the yard.Do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense.
6305428425|5.0|This movie is so funny i love it. i love the voice that mira sorvino uses when she talks. my friend mike and i watched it and had a ball.  all i can say is I INVENTED POST IT NOTES LOL.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I saw the movie. I read all the explanations here and on Salon.com (which is the best I must admit). I get the movie although I admit at first I didn't-and not putting chapters in the DVD was just plain wrong. Here's my problem with this \\"Finnegans Wake\\" type of story telling which every one calls genius; it's so NOT! Anyone could craft an incomprehensible and esoteric story and claim artistry when people have to try to put it together before it makes any sense. Let's face it once you do put it all together is the story all that interesting? No. This is dazzling the audience with nonsense to cover lack of story telling skill. Fact is folks 'Finnegans Wake' is the product of a brilliant story teller's brain breaking wind, and so is this movie. There's nothing here.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I love this movie it is so sad yet so poetic. The lines are just phenomenal. i remember so many quotes from this movie it is crazy. I love it so much i suggest you rent it or buy it you won't be upset.
B00006GEXQ|2.0|If you've read the book, I wouldn't bother to buy this. You'll be left feeling robbed. <br /> <br />This film simplifies the storyline and the characters to the point where the heart and bones of the whole thing is ripped to shreds. <br /> <br />You might be mildly entertained if you haven't already read the book, but really, if you haven't read the book yet this might very well put you right off it, and that would be a shame, because Nick Hornby is a great writer. <br /> <br />I'll put this review in context by adding that I felt completely the opposite about High Fidelity, another film made from a Nick Hornby novel, which was truly marvellous and inspiring. <br />
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I think this princess need to learn how to sing.  she uses techno intruments to back up her awful voice. me against the music is the only good song and that isn't even that good. please do yourself a favor pick christina over britney!
1573301183|5.0|Wow, this performance by Alice In Chains blew me away.  It was their first live show in almost 3 years and while watching the DVD you can just tell that they really did love performing.  Layne Staley was one of the greatest vocalists of all time, when he sings you can feel the emotion.  Jerry is an amazing and underated guitar player, he has a beautiful voice as well.  This show is a little sad though, the atmosphere on most of the unplugged shows are very moody.  This DVD rocks and AIC set a standard for modern rock/alternative.  My favorites are \\"Heaven Beside You\\" and the unreleased song \\"The Killer Is Me\\"... it has an amazing chorus and guitar riff.  If you like AIC, this is highly recomended.
B00006CXXU|5.0|MY LORD the power in this girls voice makes you wanna cry. She is so talented and beautiful.  This cd mixes it up and strays away rom the poppy days of genie in a bottle and moves into more mature topics.  The soulful styles of her voice are great.  ** some good songs are walk away , impossible, and keep on singing my song.  this cd is not a waste of money in fact i bought two because i played the first one so much it won't work any more i love this woman so much . buy her cd
B0000033P0|4.0|Tarkus is as schizophrenic an album as one is likely to find.  Half of it consists of the title epic, one of the definitive examples of classic-era progressive rock, while the second half is a big batch of filler.  ELP had already released several albums in only a few years together, while also planning and recording Pictures at an Exhibition and their movie.  It seems like they had the big title piece and just needed to pad out the remainder but were short on material by this time, so joke songs and half-finished ideas finished off the record.  And those legendarily bad lyrics on \\"The Only Way\\" really are that bad, and not in a so-bad-they're-good way either.<br /><br />But oh, what a glorious slab of prime prog is \\"Tarkus\\" itself!  Emerson's Hammond B3 and Moog are out of this world, Lake's vocals and under-rated bass work are exceptional and his guitar work surprisingly good.  Palmer turns in what is probably the strongest long-form track of his career.  As for the concept, well, there's this armadillo-tank thing and it kills a bunch of creature things until one of them kills it.  So, like a lot of prog this is basically a bunch of pretentious hoo-hah over nothing.  And I for one happen to love it.<br /><br />\\"Tarkus\\" itself gets 5 stars, the rest of it maybe 1 1/2 stars.  Overall a 4 because the title track carries the day.  For classic progsters Tarkus is a must.
0792162803|5.0|this movie was over the top outrageously funny.  i love molly shannon she is one of the top comedians of our time. she can do anything and make it funny. it was so funny when she made out with the tree. i kknow like every quote from the movie i is crazy. it is funny how they make fun at a catholic school. you will not regret watching this movie love ya world.
B0000033TE|5.0|There's way over 100 reviews here already, going into great detail on the music, so I'd like to restrict my review to the Rhino reissue itself in an attempt at helpfulness.<br /><br />First of all, as rock aficionados know, Rhino are the gods of the reissue.  They may very occasionally drop the ball but not so here.  First of all, the classic original album art (which creeped me out as a kid) is fully reproduced, the front cover in hologram-style.  The 20-page booklet has some cool and historic pictures of the band meeting with artist H.R.Giger and selecting the cover art.  There's some hilarity in Lake and Palmer's fur coats too!  Jerry McCulley's extensive and insightful liner notes help complete this terrific package, along with full lyrics and credits.  The 1996 remastering by Bill Inglot and Dan Hersch makes this almost a brand new experience with all the details they bring out from the old vinyl version.<br /><br />Last but not least, the \\"Making of Brain Salad Surgery\\" feature is great for diehard ELP fans and prog fanatics as the band discuss the sessions and the songs.  And if anyone doesn't care for this feature, it's placed last so you can just stop the CD after the last song and not be bothered by it.<br /><br />This is what reissues are supposed to be.  Can I have a job now Rhino?
6305308659|5.0|Great value DVD with special features, especially noteworthy being the Director's Commentary track.<br /><br />This movie offers a lot to audiences on many levels...from blithe entertainment fare to a deeper \\"message\\" film; all ingeniously and expertly executed with wonderful performances.  Joan Allen is heaven...<br /><br />It might just inspire you to check out some art books and revisit that dog earred copy of \\"Huckleberry Finn.\\"
B00002MZ4W|5.0|\\"I was starring at the sky, just looking for a star to pray on or wish on or something like that. I was having a sweet fix of a day dream of a boy who's reality I knew was a hopeless to be had, but then the dove of hope began his downward slope and i believed for a moment that my chances were approaching to be grabbed, but as it came down near, so did a weary tear, I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag.\\" this has to be one of my all time favorite quotes from a song, how can u get more genius than that? This album is for the broken hearted, the poets and people who just want excellent, heartfelt,sentimental music they can listen to over and over again for years to come. When you hear the songs, you will know what i mean and what these hundreds of people who reviewed are saying. Every song is written for someone. Its truly a beautiful album...and she's truly one in a million.
0316172324|5.0|Perhaps I might take a shot a clarifying the disparity between some of the ratings this book has been getting. Gladwell is a highly regarded journalist for the New Yorker and Blink is pure journalism - a trusted observer reporting ideas and insights in a particular subject - in this case, the way we make decisions. Gladwell is reporting on the ideas of others, evaluating and making connections. Many reviewers have given the book poor marks for the obviousness of its ideas, but these are not really Gladwell's ideas per se, nor are they bleeding-edge new. Gladwell is doing essentially the same thing he does for the New Yorker, just in a longer format. I found it to be a highly entertaining and thought-provoking survey of the psychology of decision-making - though neither comprehensive nor revolutionary - so if you're looking for 'meat' on these bones or fancy yourself an expert, skip the book and use the notes at the end as your shopping list. I read through Blink in an afternoon and found it to be the most enjoyable and informative book I've read this year.
B000065VA1|5.0|I got this album for one song, the commercially successful \\"In Your Eyes\\" and found that I had purchased a gem.  This album is definitely in the top 5 albums that I own.   <br /> <br />The melodies in the songs are not subtle, they do take some time to get used to but once used to them they are amazing and beautiful.  The lyrics are well written and arranged flawlessly.   <br /> <br />The only two songs that I am not huge on are \\"We Do What We're Told\\" and \\"This Is The Picture\\".  I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy them but I find them a bit hard to listen to after the rest of the album(on my copy they are tracks #8 and #9, unlike the order Amazon has). <br /> <br />\\"Sledgehammer\\" is a great song but I can't listen to it without seeing the clay-mation music video in my mind.  In my opinion the three best tracks on this album are \\"Red Rain\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\" and \\"Mercy Street\\". <br /> <br />Looking back on this purchase I would have spend a lot more than what I did knowing that this album is as good as it is.  It never gets old.  Put this album in and put it on repeat :)
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is an outstanding novel written by Alice Sebold. It is written about a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon who is murdered by a lonely, psycho neighbor named Mr. Harvey. Susie narrates the novel as she looks down on her family from heaven, which consists of her all favorite things puppies, duplexes, and gazebos. Through her eyes, we watch her family as they deal with her murder. We are also able to see how Susie deals with her family coping with her murder. How her father falls into depression, her mother's affair and as her younger sister, Lindsey, and her little brother grows. Susie also keeps track of her murderer, Mr. Harvey. She watches him escape the police by moving away to another town and watches as another innocent girl is victimized by him. Susie desperately wishes she could help her father and the police find her murderer, but she is sadly unable to do so. Instead she just looks down on them from heaven as several years go by. Susie also talks with her psychiatrist up in heaven about her death and her family. Alice Sebold constructs an amazing novel that is clearly like no other! A novel that is definitely difficult to put down. Reading this book allows you to sense the heartache that her family and friends feel for Susie's death. You also undergo rage and hatred for the affair that Susie's mother is has with the detective. Even though this novel seems to be discouraging and gloomy, it is not like that all the way through the novel. For instance, you feel excitement and happiness by the side of Susie as she witnesses her younger sister, Lindsey, first fall in love. You will surely be mesmerized by this great novel, whether it being the original, different and refreshing views of heaven. This book is of high-quality and I recommend it to readers who are mature enough to take the story in and will be able to realize that it is only a book. The ending will leave you relieved and glad that you met Susie and her family! <br />
B0001US62I|3.0|A seedy gumshoe (Mickey Rourke) works a missing persons case in New Orleans, unaware that he has a terrifying personal connection to it.  This connection and the true nature of his employer (Robert DeNiro) only become clear to him at the end of the film, but they should be clear to any attentive filmgoer long before that, even if you haven't read the Amazon review, which gives away a major plot revelation.  Director Alan Parker scores points for style, but his story is a constant barrage of horror movie and private eye conventions.  DeNiro's performance is broad, overly mannered, and clich; the identity of his character is immediately apparent, robbing the revelation at the end of the film of its impact.  Parker's direction and interesting performances from Rourke and Lisa Bonet keep it watchable, but a bit more self-restraint and imagination would have improved this film a great deal./
B00005QZ7U|5.0|We also recommed this movie but also with some caution if you plan to watch it with the young kids. That is a factor the other reviewers do not mention enough. That said this is a terrific movie to watch with your older teenager. We also like the message about true love and how materialism is empty. There are some real good points from a Chrisitan point of view about how meaningless and surface bright lights work in our lives. My wife and I found this movie very spiritually uplifting.
0887307280|5.0|Definately one the best books I've read so far for helping a small business owner get his/her head around how to run his/her business.
055357342X|5.0|First time I read GAme of Thrones, I thought to myself, \\"That's a pretty good book!\\". I had kind of skimmed thru it, like I do so many sci-fi books (see Jordan, Salvatore, etc.). I read clash of kings, and storm of swords, and thought the same thing: \\"pretty good book!\\".  <br />Then I read them again...and again...and again. <br />Now, I think this story is the greatest sci-fi story ever told. Every time I reread any one of the three, I'm delighted by something new; like some obscure little story  suddenly provides insight into something unbelievable (like the story jojen told bran about his father and ned stark).  <br />Now, all I can say is: Wow!!! Greatest story ever told (and it's not even halfway done yet!)
B0000024YL|5.0|The beginning of my 7th grade year in 1999 I bought this album. It was one of my favorites. I played it so much that the disc was thinning, but not seriously thinning. Even though Homeward Bound, The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin'Groovey), Kathy's Song, and For Emily Whenever I May Find Her are live tracks, I still think this is one of the best Simon and Garfunkel albums and rock albums of all time. Highly recommended.
B000023VR6|5.0|THE BEST ALBUM, PROBABLY EVER, PERIOD. The sequel to that oh so remenisint Chronic, 2001. With the whole family on this track: Dre brings new friends, eminem, and calls some old ones, Snoop,to just kill all competition for years to come. With the best Instrumentalsstill to this day and Dre Himself Bustin some serious flows, this CD is perfectly balenced. Played out kind of like a Movie. Starting with \\"Lolo\\", and then continuing with \\"The Watcher\\"(which i still freestyle to)then bringin somethin for the ladies with out losin any gangster edge at all \\"F**k You\\", then gangsta anthem \\"Still Dre\\", Xxplosive, the list goes on forever. I still haven't got tired of any of these songs. Also featuring Nate Dogg, Xzibit, Hittman, Kurupt and MC Ren. This CD still sets the bar for future albums. So lets go Dre. Get crackin on that Detox. Buy the Album. Then get the instrumental CD.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|There is no need to comment on this movie's quality as a drama and a western. It is the best that has ever been done. <br /> <br />It is most unfortunate that this copy, apparently produced by Hallmark, has the video resolution of a poorly produced VHS.  It is virtually unwatchable on a large screen TV.  What a travesty.
B0000931QR|1.0|One of the most overrated bands nowadays delivers one of the most succesful albums in spanish pop history. So, what's so strange about it? Nothing, we all have seen how pop music in the last decades has been getting worse and worse. This is predictable considering how technology can fix records that otherwise would have been doomed to oblivion. This album is one of the best examples, four mediocre musicians with no creativity and a talentless singer - that tries to hard to imitate a little baby singing - deliver an album with no other quality than a handful of catchy melodies buried under an exaggerated plastic production. The lyrics are even worse than the music, they are so simple, repetitive and unoriginal that I seriously think they were written by a 5-year-old. If you haven't listen to any of the songs you should be grateful because they stick to your brain like cancer. I had to give it one star because there is no zero star rating. Like I said in the title, this is pure trash.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|Now, don't get me wrong, I think Mandy Moore is a doll. But I fell asleep watching her Chasing Liberty movie and didn't bother watching the rest of the movie before sending it back to the rental store. It's a boring stinker that is making Roman Holiday roll in it's grave. <br /> <br />But this little nutrition-less-but-nevertheless-sweet confection? I stayed up past 1:20 AM to finish it. I don't care what anyone says and I'm like, 33-it's a darling movie. <br /> <br />I've never been a Holmes' fan, but she is just so likeable and pretty in this-very natural and I thought appropriate in terms of playing someone just get getting her bearings. She gets to wear some sweet duds in this movie ala formal dresses.  <br /> <br />The little father-daughter connection between her and Michael Keaton was also sweet-I wanted to call my dad and tell him I loved him after watching it. What was up with the Mom though? She seemed kinda off and she gave a look to Katie's love interest at the ball that was a little drunk and pervy I think. <br /> <br />I also thought the chemistry between her and the James guy was great-they would make really cute kids. Tell them to hook it up and grace the world with some uber pretty children. And the best part is the chemistry is like, PG rated, so you don't have the cover the kids' eyes at all-all you get is a couple kisses and a pretty mild shimi-shimi dance from Katie in hot pants during her not-so \\"wild\\"acting out moment. <br /> <br />All in all, a very sweet movie with a really asthetically pleasing cast(think of walking clearasil and noxema and whitestrip advertisments all melded into one-or uh, like several-body/bodies)- and don't miss seeing Amerie as Katie's roomie-she's a really great singer-in her movie debut. She's a natural and not just your typical singer wannabe crossover actress who can't act! <br /> <br />
B0000AI44Q|5.0|The story flows so well that it's amazing that this is also just fantastic music to chill-out the evening with.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|A few of the reviews pretty much say it all.  I kept my eyes closed half of the time, but after seeing it, it's really not all that scary.    A \\"murderer\\" does not actually kill any of his victims.  Instead, he makes them kill themselves by putting them in, basically, self-torture chambers.  In every one of his devices, he somehow watches the victims kill themselves.  Two of his victims are put in a bathroom together and chained to separate pipes.    The point of this movie is to learn how grateful we should be for our lives.  Definately VERY bloody, but once you see it and know what happens, you can really enjoy it (unless, of course, you like these types of movies).
068987474X|5.0|OK...  Before anyone asks, I'm not taking lessons on anything nor was there a reason I needed to read this book.  I just heard it was quite funny and well-written, so I decided to check it out...  He's Just Not That Into You by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo.  It didn't disappoint...<br /><br />Behrendt and Tuccillo were both involved in the writing duties for Sex In The City.  During one of the chat sessions in the writers room, the women were trying to figure out if a guy was sending signals to one of the girls as to whether he still liked her.  Greg just came out and told them...  \\"He's just not that into you!\\"  It was a real revelation to all of them, and it led to the writing of this book.  It's a series of letters and lessons that should help a woman understand when a guy isn't into them and the relationship any more, but can't bring himself to tell her that in so many words.  The book is probably more harsh than women want to hear (we're scum, OK?), but if they pay attention they can minimize their pain and move on to better opportunities.  The male/female perspective and interplay between the two authors is fantastic, and even if you aren't in this particular situation, the writing is funny.  I laughed a lot while reading it, but I also understood that Greg pretty well has the male species nailed down.  If we're into you, you'll know if.  If you have to guess and wonder, we're probably not (or we don't deserve you in the first place).  Of course, there are nice guys who get stuck with nasty women also, and that's not explored here.  But I'm guessing that the scenarios in the book happen more frequently than the opposite ones.<br /><br />If you're in a \\"is he interested in me\\" quandary, read the book.  If you're not but you want an entertaining read, still read the book.  Either way it will be beneficial.
B0002F6BRE|1.0|I thought it was the law to make subtitles and/or closed caption available on the newer movies, etc. I bought the DVD at Christmas for my deaf wife but had to return it. Just got a copy at Block Busters and the problem still remains. The movie is usless for people with hearing problems.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|The opening scene of Porco Rosso shows that the year is 1929, a decade after the First World War.  This is depicted on the cover of the magazine Cinema, which rests over Porco Rosso's piggish face. It was a time of high tension throughout Europe and the Mediterranean Sea where the story takes place.  In Germany the Nazi's were gaining strength while planning their conquest of Germany and later Europe with the possibility of the world.  Italians were under Il Duce's iron rule, as he commanded the Fascist party, the only party allowed.  Nineteen twenty-nine was just years before Francisco Franco's control in Spain with a Fascist ideology.<br /><br />What is most alarming is that 1929 was only one decade away from the Second World War, which was slowly brewing throughout Europe.  In essence, Hayao Miyazaki literally depicts the year that was in-between the two World Wars, but his film also turns into a political allegory for the that time.  This allegory is depicted through a flying pig that defies political undercurrents by collecting bounties on outlaws and trying to stay outside the boundaries of society.<br /><br />Porco Rosso, once a man, now a pig due to a curse, flies for himself only, as he collects bounties and makes life sour for air pirates that terrorize the Mediterranean Sea.  Porco lives a lonely life in a hide-away somewhere in Mediterranean Sea where he bathes in the sun when he is not hunting flying pirates.  Isolation seems to be Porco's way of dealing with his appearance and the only excursion from his personal island is done with help of darkness.  At night shadows help veil his pig face, as he visits his favorite hangout, Hotel Adriano.<br /><br />Miyazaki does a marvelous job in his creation of the character Porco who portrays dispositions such as selfishness, cynicism, and gloom through a pig without hope of being something better.  The idea of using a pig is also remarkably brilliant, as the pig is often used as a symbol for greed and sloth.  Porco's laziness is depicted through his sunbathing and his inactive participation in politics and society, as the world around him is once again about to crumble.<br /><br />The persona and attire of Porco brings a mood that is experienced through many film noirs where cynical characters meet in sleazy and ominous atmospheres.  This is evident when Porco visits Hotel Adriano for the first time when all his enemies are present.  The film noir that Porco Rosso offers also augments the cinematic value of the story, as it authentically depicts the time period.  The cynicism is further enhanced if the audience reflects on the political atmosphere of the 1930s in Europe where politics divided families and neighbors turned each other in due to different beliefs.<br /><br />In the middle of this an American pilot, Donald Curtis, arrives to claim fame and secure a spot in Hollywood, and maybe later the Presidency.  When Curtis for the first time hears Madame Gina sing at the restaurant at Hotel Adriana he falls in love.  However, he does not know that her love belongs to another, even though this other does not know.  Curtis' reason to come to Europe was to have a dogfight with the infamous Porco Rosso and he finds his opportunity when Porco is on his way to get his plane fixed.  This is the way he wants to claim his fame by shooting down Porco, which he successfully does as Porco's plane has a motor problem.<br /><br />Somehow Porco succeeds in getting his plane through Italy and to Milan where Paolo Piccolo a skilled airplane mechanic that he trusts lives.  When Porco arrives he discovers that the Paolo's 17-year old American granddaughter is more or less running the show.  Initially, Porco is suspicious and wants to go to another mechanic, but is convinced to stay.  Fortunately Porco's suspicions are groundless, as his suspicions seem to be more sexist than based on facts.  When the plane is fixed Porco can return to his life, as a bounty hunter, but the political climatehas changed and it seems to have put Porco in a spot where he is forced to take a side.<br /><br />Hayao Miyazaki's Porco Rosso is a fantastic animated journey that also makes a strong political statement.  The film entertains young and old, but also leaves a lot for the audience to ponder while the magnificent animation transcends into the mind through vibrant colors and detailed lines.  Cleverly, Miyazaki communicates his story through an obvious storyline that is visually explicit, but also hidden in visual codes and symbols.  This means that the film is multifaceted with several ideas that can have an audience member scratching their head for a long time.  The story also keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat, as nail-biting suspense leaves the audience guessing what will happen next.  Ultimately, this cinematic masterpiece leaves the audience with a fulfilling experience that offers something for everyone.ical climate has changed and it seems to have put Porco in a spot where he is forced to take a side. <br /> <br />Hayao Miyazaki's Porco Rosso is a fantastic animated journey that also makes a strong political statement.

B00001U0DP|5.0|An Award Winning Film. My friends were reluctant to watch this movie at first, but afterwards they were grateful! This is a part comedy, part drama love story in Italy during WW2, as the Nazis approach and take over. It's a story of the existence of innocence and the struggle to maintain innocence and everything that is beautiful about life! Evil tries to overcome innocence and smother it, but it prevails! It's a lovely, delightful story of hope! If you speak English, there is an English Soundtrack available on the DVD! This is easily the Best Italian movie I have ever seen! The arrival of the tank near the end is \\"breathtaking\\"! A lovely movie! I want to see more of this Director/Actors movies!! And...ladies, he's so Handsome too!
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I have been an Iron Maiden fan since the early eighties. My favorite lineup includes Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson, so I was really glad to find that they rejoined in 2000 for the Brave New World CD. I don't like this one as much, but it still qualifies as good listening. Bruce's voice does seem a bit strained in some of the songs. It's almost like a live recording on his part. I didn't used to like guitarist Janick Gers much, but I have to admit that he adds some much needed energy to songs like Paschendale (my favorite track on the album). That's the only song that really stands out for me. The others are good, but they don't really stay with me. I still think that Number of the Beast was Iron Maiden's most powerful album. They continue to make good music, but there's nothing ground breaking happening here. A bit derivative, but worth the money.
B00008PX8P|5.0|that i envy all those people who could listen to zeppelins live in 70's,  <br />this dvd and cd gives only one bite of cake... <br /> <br />god bless led zeppelin (and pink floyd also) :)
B0000DYJM6|4.0|30 tracks of Pearl Jam rare tracks, B-sides and Studio Demo's were released by Pearl Jam in 2003. They might not be hits but the songs are well worth listening too. The songs show the evolution of Pearl Jam and Ed Vedder's voice is masterful throughout the double CD. I missed the chance to see them Live when they toured Australia but I am more than happy purchasing this - its like the provervial gold at the end of the rainbow.<br /><br />Any serious Pearl Jam fan will enjoy the uniqueness and the comparitive historical sounding of this album. It draws a parallel between the past and the present Pearl Jam.

B000669GAI|5.0|I am totally a fan and devoted to the music of Pearl Jam. The albums 'Ten' and 'Vitalogy' were successes and the one's that made me fully appreciate the uniqueness of this great alt rock band. This is the Essential 2 CD album of the hits of Pearl Jam taking songs from all the albums 30 in all.<br /><br />There is no new material or new songs, just the old stuff. And the old material is what made PO what they are today. The rock kings next to Red Hot Chili Peppers. The compilation starts off with some of the best hits like Once, Even Flow and Jeremy and end also with classic hits like Last Kiss, Wishlist, Man of the Hour and Given.<br /><br />The CD is a must for any fan and I absolutely love it and Ed Vedder you have a great deep rich voice.
0201721481|5.0|The traditional way to teach programming, especially C++, has been to introduce the basics of the language and building on top the basics as the book progresses.  Lippman, et. al. have diverted from the traditional way of teaching C++, which leaved the reader with a better understanding of the topic and the language as whole.  Instead of creating yet another \\"C++ Reference Manual\\", which in turn gives the reader a very detail description of the language, the authors have focused on the effective and current best practices in C++ from the get go.  The Standard Template Library is introduced early on in the book, and the readers begin to experience \\"how things are done in the real world\\" early on, instead of waiting until the end of the text.<br /><br />C++ is a powerful language; more importantly, it is language that gives its users plenty of power.  Enough power and freedom that if not tamed, could become very dangerous.  Unlike some other \\"newer\\" programming languages, C++ has the ability to manipulate the lowest levels of the system: hardware and the operating system.  The authors took this notion into consideration and wrote the book in such a way that proper programming techniques and methodologies are \\"forced\\" from the beginning.  Programming in C++ also requires a different mind-set as well: objects, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc...  These are topics best understood by example.  The standard template library (STL) is the best way to show the users how the most powerful techniques in C++ are being utilized.  Starting with the String and the Vector classes, the authors walk a very fine line of teaching the novice users about the ins and outs of the language and others how to best take advantage of the available libraries that are provided with the language.<br /><br />To new readers of the language this approach might seem a bit difficult to grasp, but the fact of the matter is that C++ is not an easy programming language to learn.  If you are seriousabout learning C++, what better to learn the language than learning the right way from the start?  It might seem a bit overwhelmed at first, but that's ok.  There is a glossary of introduced terms at the end of each chapter, along with a summary of topics covered.  At the beginning of each section (part) of the book, the authors give an overall summary what's to come, and why these topics are covered when they are.  The same goes for the beginning of each chapter: a summary of what's to come begins each chapter before the material is covered in detail.  The authors realize that the approach might seem a bit unorthodox, and take extra care in making sure the readers are not overwhelmed with information.  For people with C++ experience, you will appreciate this method of teaching a lot more.  The readers are exposed to \\"important\\" C++ terms and phrases from the beginning instead of waiting until the last couple of chapters of the book.<br /><br />Other than the format change, and updated material to comply with the latest ANSI C++ standard, this book has updated examples the source code for which can be downloaded from the book's web site.  There is C programming coverage in this book, which is very good.  The programming style is C and C++ are inherently different (procedural and object-orientation), and talking about C would simply confuse the readers.  The book's focus from the beginning to the end is how to best utilize and write programs in the C++ programming language: how to become an efficient C++ programmer.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the C++ programming language.  If you have used C++ before, this book is still a valuable addition to your library, as it covers C++ with efficiency and proper programming style in mind.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Firstly I loved the way the cover of the CD was designed and the pictures of the band in studio recording is absolutely novel and great fun. Like other reviewers I will also add to their voice my voice and state that this album is the missing link in the evolution of this great American band. It is very enjoyable to listen to the rock riffs and the small amount of grunge and funk in this album - a mixture that is used so well in many of their albums.<br /><br />Pearl Jam's popularity is not diminishing even after all this time. They have messages in all their songs and their lyrics are pure and true to heart. Their music transcends to fans' heart and souls for one reason, and because they are so real in delivery and execution.<br /><br />All the songs on this release are great. There is none lacking but my three favourites are; 'Lukin', 'Off He Goes' and 'Sometimes'.<br /><br />Well worth getting for old Pearl Jam fans. They will truly appreciate this CD.
0060516070|5.0|If you are ever consigned to that mythical desert island, and can only have one management book, make this the book.<br /><br />I got my first copy of Peter Drucker's Effective Executive right after I started my first management job after getting out of the Marines in 1968.  I read and re-read my hardbound copy, dipping into it again and again for more than three decades until that copy finally fell apart two years ago, and I had to buy another copy.  Even though I've read it - cover to cover - several times and dipped into it, literally, hundreds of times, I always find something valuable.<br /><br />Drucker is one of the most lucid and insightful writers there is.  In the Effective Executive, he applies those skills to analyzing the job of anyone who has to do knowledge work.  In other words, this isn't for the \\"executive\\" in the classic sense.  If thinking is a large part of what you do, this is a good book for you.  The main points are staggeringly simple.  Know thy time.  What can I contribute?  Making strength productive.  First things first.  Making effective decisions.<br /><br />For each key point, Drucker gives you, in his usual straightforward way, both examples and ideas.  This<br /><br />is the book that first taught me to schedule my work in ninety-minute blocks.  It's the one that taught me not only about the importance of setting priorities, but how to do it.  It's a book that taught me the basics<br /><br />of decision making, but also that the most important thing about decision making is to have a method for it.<br /><br />I recommend this to all my students in supervision, management, and leadership classes.  I recommend it to you, even if you are not bound for a desert island.
0312319517|4.0|Frederick Forsyth has been quoted as saying he only writes a new book when he needs the money. His material has never gotten thin, but on the other hand we only get a new book every few years. A pity, as in the espionage/thriller genre, he's got one of the highest batting averages - he's never written a bad book. His writing is matter of fact, never flashy and moves quickly. Forsyth researches and assembles his plots with the inventive and systematic precision characteristic of his heroes. \\"Avenger\\" shows Forsyth he's still got what it takes, almost four decades after \\"The Day of the Jackal.\\"<br /><br />His hero, Cal Dexter, is a onetime \\"tunnel rat\\", one of the American soldiers in Vietnam tracking the VC into their extensive tunnel network and fighting a harrowing war in its shadows. The combat and survival skills he gains serve him well later in life when, owing to a personal misfortune, the middle-aged lawyer moonlights as a freelance hunter of bad guys.<br /><br />Forsyth's detail on the tunnel rats is fascinating, a little-known aspect of the Vietnam war. So are his passages set placed in wartorn Bosnia and Serbia, whose modern tragedies have not yet been adequately explored by English-language novelists, and where one particular tragedy will ultimately involve Avenger.<br /><br />I give this book four stars instead of five.<br /><br />--Forsyth occasionally puts Britishisms in the mouths of Americans. All the top British writers do this occasionally, but isn't this what editors are paid to catch?<br /><br />--It seems at times dated. The book has the requisite computer hacker on an electronic trail, but Dexter sometimes seems transplanted out of the 1960s; his gear often has a mid-century camper's feel to it.<br /><br />--And our bad guy, a former Milosevic warlord named Zoran Zilic, builds himself an impregnable tropical hideout, a huge and self-contained plantation where he has seemingly thought of everything to keep enemies out and off his trail. It seems a bit fantastic and unreal, more like a bad guy's lair in a James Bond novel. Forsyth's realism has generally been one of his strongest suits; we don't expect to encounter Dr. No in one of his books.<br /><br />Still, Dexter's ingenuity in taking on Zilic is impressive and absorbing. The quibbles above are only that. This is a fine book.trail. It seems a bit fantastic and unreal, more like a bad guy's lair in a James Bond novel.

B00005JMJG|3.0|I expected more from \\"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.\\" Some great actors are in it, the plot sounds compelling on several levels, and it was written by one of Hollywood's best.<br /><br />It has a wonderful menagerie of intriguing elements: psychological drama, philosophical and ethic layers, complex love stories, greed, honesty, manipulation, and questions of destiny, reality and time. What doesn't it work? What happened?<br /><br />The idea of this film was bigger than those who put it together.<br /><br />The Idea<br />Adventurous girl (Clementine) meets shy boy (Joel). They fall into a sweeping romance, as the Yin finds the Yang.<br /><br />Somehow, for reasons only vaguely alluded to, it all breaks down. Clementine does something stupid and Joel suspects the worst.<br /><br />They break up, and Clementine decides to go to a special service to have her memory of him erased. He finds out after the fact, and decides he should do the same.<br /><br />In the process of having this done, he subconsciously remembers each event chronologically reversed. It isn't a tape played backwards. He just remembers what happened a month early, then the day before, until he gets to that first memory. However, as he goes through the messy breakup, and back into the good times, he realizes he loves her.<br /><br />Joel struggles the entire time asleep, as he has a sense of what is happening and desperately wants to save the relationship. Clementine too, although in Joel's mind, wants the relationship and understands the issue of his memory being erased. She does not see the same urgency, frustrating Joel.<br /><br />The ultimate conflict becomes saving the relationship. Can Joel find a solution, will he be able to in time even though various hurdles are before him, and what would the relationship look like when he wakes up?<br /><br />I had a difficult time following which reality, and what time and place things were happening. During the time inside Joel's memory, I became lost, and did not know what I was seeing. We see Joel as a child, as a man-child, at different events of his relationship with Clementine, and events would be different from the one I though was reality. On paper, this whole process is interesting, but, on screen, I had a hard time keeping up.<br /><br />Secondary plot lines are loose, at best, and could be removed without affecting the strength of the movie. Their presence, in fact, adds to the confusion, as I did not understand why certain characters were acting the way they did.<br /><br />For example, Stan, the technician overseeing Joel's memory erasure brings along his assistant Patrick, and they both pillage Joel's home for snacks and drinks while Joel is there asleep mid-procedure. Mary, Stan's girlfriend and receptionist at the clinic, comes by she and Stand smoke some pot. A lack of class and ethics I understand, but how this happens is the confusing part. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the brilliant, though staid, doctor who invented the procedure tolerates it all when he comes by to help out. He must have smelled the pot, and otherwise saw the pandemonium that had ensued. He himself seems largely professional, and yet never comments on their actions.<br /><br />The movie has good points.<br /><br />Kate Winslet demonstrates an amazing American accent. I forgot she was British. Her skills here were underused. The producers could have saved money with a more stereotypical actress like Drew Barrymore. Barrymore has played similar characters before.<br /><br />Jim Carrey shows us he has more chops than just as an incredible comedic physical actor. His dramatic personality here was key to my interest in the movie.<br /><br />Elijah Wood (he played Patrick), most known for his part as Frodo Baggins in LOTR, keeps stretching himself. His part was inconsequential to the plot, and a secondary plot about his efforts to woo Clementine was not seriously developed.<br /><br />\\"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\\" is a well-reviewed movie, and is worth seeing. The question of memories and how we should manage a broken heart is good to ponder, and the movie will help you get there. Its unorthodox approach might not bog down other viewers as is did for me, so give it a shot. It isn't nearly as forgettable as Clementine hoped Joel would be.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comie will help you get there.

B00003CXC7|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time last weekend when it was on Turner Classic Movies.  It is terrific!  Sometimes it's hard for me to believe these people wouldn't  put their blinds down, though they do at some points in the movie.  Stewart's character is the ultimate \\"nosy neighbor\\".  The plot is just so fascinating and well done.  I also saw \\"Vertigo\\" for the first time recently, but I definitely like this classic Hitchcock movie better.  The story in \\"Rear Window\\" held my attention; and the climax, for me at least, was much more suspenseful than the climax in \\"Vertigo\\".  I highly recommend this movie!      I was curious if anyone else who has watched this movie saw someone who looks like Alfred Hitchcock himself in one scene.  It's about 25 minutes into the movie, and this man is in the struggling songwriter's apartment. He has his back to the piano, then turns around.  I just wondered if my eyes are playing tricks on me.
B000002H70|4.0|i think that this is the cure's best album. my favorite song is same deep water as you. i onyl gave it four stars because the album gets boring very fast and isnt applicable to anyone outside of cure fans (im just starting to get into them, i dont like them that much). if you think you like the cure, start here or with a greatest hits.
B0000TB050|3.0|I was amazed at the sound quality of this dvd. But after watching it several times and watching Edge's fingers doing his fancy work, I sadly realized that parts of this concert have been doctored.     That's the reason for the excellent sound, the use of overdubs. On certain songs it's obvious Band's playing has been tampered with and cleaned up. Neverthless the concert itself is without doubt one of the best of Elevation Tour (This is the best among countless average performances, including Boston DVD). Bono still sounds raspy and rough, but with a better voice than Boston. Also, better setlist, except for the shameful rendition of 'Angel Of Harlem'. Sadly, Bono's voice on 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' struggles as well. But listen to such wonderful Edge and Bono performance of 'Wake Up Dead Man'. Out of Body!.    Cameras work is far better here, this is a document of a real Gig, not a MTV video promo (as Boston). Crowd is hot and you feel the energy on the air. This is a more honest show. I still don't understand 'Mysterious Ways'. Why they didn't keep the song along the actual concert?. Can't they help but editing and cutting out a performance?. Red Rocks was horribly half edited out, and Zoo TV Sidney missed 'Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World'.    Rumors say they're going to release a DVD Boxset by late this year. I really don't want 'remastered' versions of shows we've been watching for even 22 years. Rather, I'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage.     Just in case, here's a list of several unreleased PRO-SHOT filmed concerts from early 80's to Pop Mart Tour (I didn't include Elevation because there're 2 DVD's out there from the same Tour).

6305922756|4.0|When I first saw \\"Spinal Tap\\" in the theater, I thought it was hilarious... and there ARE some truly hilarious moments, mostly in the live performance segments: Big Bottoms, Stonehenge and the Pod People sequence in particular.  The \\"behind the scenes\\" portions, however, are less inspired and become repetitious after a while, although the \\"lost backstage\\" sequence is a classic too.<br /><br />If you haven't ever seen this movie, by all means get a copy of the DVD and watch it.  It's fun, and a bit of a cultural landmark. But don't expect nonstop hilarity.
0316172324|2.0|It seems that this book is more about the DANGERS of \\"thinking without thinking\\" then the advantages. Maybe the first 50 pages are interesting stories of people acting on instant insight successully, but the rest of the book describes disasters from doing so.

B00005MAM2|2.0|This was made long before the advent of computer generated animation, and I really miss the old hand drawn animation. It just has so much more character than this new CGI stuff. The story on the other hand didn't quite add up at all. Maybe something is really lost in the translation, but the writing isn't much better than a Godzilla movie. At least a Godzilla film has a campy charm to it. The plot just seems to rest very uneasily upon the dialogue of the characters rather than be integrated into the story. So many of the characters are just making speeches to try make a vain attempt at explaining what's going on. Still, it didn't make any sense. Why were these experiments conducted in the first place? Why is Akira being worshiped as a techno saviour? Why do they await his return when he destroyed the city last time he came? (Come and kill us again Akira) Why continue such experiments? Why did Tetsuo become like the experiments just by coming in contact with one? Why didn't the many other people turn like Tetsuo when so many others were exposed to the same experiment? Ultimately, it's but a movie about a kid going on a murderous rampage that's fueled by his own inadequacy. That might appeal to teens who have fantasized about going postal on their high school, but nobody else. Anyone who gives this movie 5 stars should be committed before they hurt somebody if you ask me.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko became one of my favorites the moment I saw it, and maintained it's position in my heart even many viewings later.  It's just a film that resonates, in which the characters' emotions as they go through extreme experiences can speak to many people. <br /> <br />This does not mean, however, that they speak to all people.  I know more than one intelligent movie buff who did not like this film, who felt that the idiosyncratic elements distracted from the theme and from the ability of the viewer to relate it to their own reality.  If you're not a fan of the surreal, this movie may not be for you.
B00003CXB2|5.0|First let me laud the other reviewers who have shared such historical detail with us on this page.  They help flesh out the famous story of the blond Briton who made his mark on history among the dark men of the desert.  I have nothing to add to their comments in this regard; at age 45 I have just seen the film for the first time, having been recently inspired by the NY Times list of \\"1000 best movies ever made\\" to see many of The Great Films I've Never Seen. <br /> <br />From the perspective of a newcomer, therefore, I have to say I'm astonished at how perfect this massive epic is.  Two years in the making, on a nearly unheard-of scale at the time, bogged down by the many problems of shooting on location in the actual deserts of the Middle East, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" was such an ordeal that Peter O'Toole turned down the lead in \\"Dr. Zhivago,\\" David Lean's next epic, simply because he was so wrung out from playing T.E. Lawrence that he couldn't imagine a similar experience for quite some time.  Sure enough, they never worked together again.  Even with all of the problems, this film is simply phenomenal in every way. <br /> <br />NY Times reviewer Bosley Crowther, writing in 1962, seemed flummoxed with the fact that Lean chose to leave Lawrence an enigmatic character.  It was a simpler time when this movie was made and released, and Crowther seems to have wanted firm answers to the man's character and his motives.  As the other reviewers here make clear, that's just not the point.  Lawrence was, and is, the embodiment of the phrase Winston Churchill used in reference to Russia, \\"a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.\\"  Time has borne out that Lean was absolutely right to leave it that way, rather than guessing at the man's motivations and hidden life.  A larger than life character is almost always ruined when dissected. <br /> <br />T.E. Lawrence came to be known as being as big a character as the desert itself, and Lean's epic drives this point home.  On theday after viewing, one is left with two thoughts especially:  The desert is vast and unforgiving, and Lawrence was equally immovable and probably a manic depressive.  Beyond that, the amazingly rich photography, the loving attention to detail, the perfectly pitched pace of the story and the multiple relationships among the characters, and even Alec Guinness in \\"brownface\\" as Prince Faisel, combine to create an incredible work of art that will never grow old.  My only nitpick would be that in one of Guinness's scenes a line had to be changed after principal filming, so that his lips move but his voice says something different.  In a nearly-four-hour film, that one nitpick is so insignificant that I feel retentive even mentioning it. <br /> <br />At once an epic on a grand scale, an intimate character portrait that leaves us with tantalizing questions, a historical record, and a war film with an anti-war (or at least war-weary) ending, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is unique and cherished, for good reason.  It may have taken me 45 years to see this masterpiece, but it won't take another 45 to see it again.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought this album out of impulse after hearing \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" on the radio.  To my surprise, I thought the rest of the album was even better than what I had heard on the radio.  Gavin has ridiculous talent, and the soul in his voice is incredible. He impresses me far more than Jason Mraz, Howie Day, and those compared to him.  His sound is different, and the music is great to alter a depressed mood. For anyone who thinks some of the lyrics to be \\"stupid\\" or not worthwhile: sometimes it's nice to hear a song that's made for fun.  I love this album, and even after playing it a thousand times over, I still LOVE to hear it.  Some of his best include \\"Meaning\\", \\"Belief\\", and \\"More Than Anyone.\\"   <br />GO BUY THIS ALBUM...it was worth EVERY single penny...and this means a lot coming from me because I rarely buy albums.
B000002UAU|4.0|<br />If we're bickering over best album of all time, I'd go with the White Album.  And in terms of groundbreaking Beatles' albums, I'd pick Revolver before SP. <br /> <br />When I first bought SP, I listened to it hundreds of times.  But not much after that. <br /> <br />Originality, and being the so-called first concept album may be cool, but listenability is what counts.  How much dust will it gather after a few months?... <br /> <br />If you're into the Beatles, and don't have SP, buy it.  Play it a few times...Then keep it in your collection in case you need to throw a 60s theme party. <br /> <br />Songwriting: 9/10  <br />Musicianship: 9/10  <br />Sound Quality: 9/10  <br />Originality: 10/10
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown's novel \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" reveals the controversial and fascinating history of early Christianity in a fast paced murder mystery. His research shows how Mother Earth became a man's world when the goddess was banished from the temple.  The obliteration of the sacred feminine resulted in a \\"life out of balance\\" and disrespect for Mother Earth. Based on the Coptic and Dead Sea Scrolls the Bible is a product of men with a political agenda. The Holy Grail is an ancient symbol for the sacred feminine and represents a woman. And that Jesus was a mortal prophet who married Mary Magdalene and had children.<br /><br />Although the suspense is a page-turner Brown's remarkable research would have been better served by a slower paced novel with more developed characters. It was the riveting story not the historical research or the two-dimensional good versus evil characters that stayed with me after reading the book.

If you like movies that are stupid funny then this is the movie for you. Almost ever line out of the dorky kids mouth mad me almost cry with laughter. By far the best part of the movie was the bike scene where he took a mountain bike of a ramp and right when he went off of it, it broke and he feel to the ground it was awsome. I would highly recommend this to mostly teens but i think an adult with a good sense of humor would really enjoy it.

B000002UAX|5.0|<br />No silly costumes, concepts or overproduction. <br /> <br />If you're starting a Beatles collection, pick up the standards: Red/blue compilations, SP, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Abbey Road, early stuff, etc.  It's all good. <br /> <br />But this is the one you'll keep going back to the most.  It has the best variety of rockers, wry humor, and sweet songs the Beatles were known for.  There's an edginess and timelessness not found on any other in their collection. <br /> <br />The only weakness is that there's one or two fluff songs, such as Wild Honey Pie and Revolution 9.  The rest is classic.
B00005JNDZ|3.0|Don't buy this movie, as you'll just regret wasting your money on a film that's not up to scratch as the original. Get it for your birthday, Christmas, or hint that you want it, but can't find it cheap enough, and some nice person will buy it for you.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from this movie, although I ended up watching it straight away, just to see what it was like. I already knew it wasn't going to be a patch on the original, and it was going to be totally different from the book. What I noticed was how different Bridget was from the movie. She was slightly attractive in the first movie, but in this, Renee had awful stylists etc. Her hair was a mess a lot of the time, and she had hamster cheeks. And what was equally distracting was the fact she was poured into really low cut tops a lot of the time. We all know that when Renee's not being Bridget she's ultra skinny, but in this she just wanted to flaunt her chest as much as possible! At least 50% of the world's population, if not more, have them dear, there's no need to shove them in our faces! And as for the lesbian kiss - what was the point in that, apart from the fact it was a cheap thrill for the guys? There was absolutely no need for it.<br /><br />So the film is very different from the book. Bearing in mind, I haven't read the book in a few years, so don't quote me on this. The Thai jail scene is a lot longer, and more tougher in the book. There's no Like A Virgin singalongs in that! And Bridget lost a lot of weight during her time in there (in the book), but she looked just the same when she came out. The first book was not-so-loosely based on Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The first movie left a lot of that in, and even included a lot of \\"inside jokes\\" for those of us who are familiar with the book and the filmed version starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy. \\"The Edge of Reason\\" was not-so-loosely based on another Jane Austen novel, \\"Persuasion,\\" but any overt Austen references are completely wiped out here. Also, in the second book, Bridget had to interview the God in her life, Colin Firth. That would have been slightly difficult since Colin Firth is already in the movie playing of course Mark Darcy. I'm pretty sure this scene might be among the extras, but not included in the movie. Of course, they could have always done an Oceans 12, and had Colin Firth playing Mark Darcy playing Colin Firth. The mind boggles.<br /><br />Some of the movie is funny - the skiing scenes gave me flashbacks of my own skiing incidents (including dragging the instructor down the slope with me cos I was so scared), and yet again, the hair-pulling, and eye gouging between Colin Firth & Hugh Grant. But apart from that, there's nothing else that funny about the movie. It's watchable. It just doesn't have the same class as the original. At least with the second book, Helen Fielding attempted to move away from her original work, and have some fun with Bridget. This movie sticks closely to the first, with no surprises thrown in.<br /><br />Bridget's friends have a lesser part in this than the first, and they were hilarious in the first! There is also another 'friend' added who's never really introduced, but just hovering in the background.<br /><br />A lot of this movie is meant to be spent watching with a group of girlie friends, in your PJs, drinking wine, and having pillow fights. Why? Mainly because every other scene is backed by an overly loud soundtrack, featuring a lot of the songs that funnily enough on the soundtrack to the movie!!! Funnily enough, there is also a lot of drunken ballads to be sung at the top of your voice, like the \\"All By Myself\\" at the start of the first movie. Talk about over publicising the soundtrack to the movie! Also, there's a lot of product placement in this movie: Coca Cola, Vodaphone, BMI and probably more that I missed. It's very noticable product placement, not just subtle.<br /><br />The movie was better than I was expecting. But still not up to scratch. I really need to read the books again. And start keeping a diary - again.ng. But still not up to scratch. I really need to read the books again. And start keeping a diary - again.

B00065LY1I|4.0|\\"Ultimate Kylie\\" is the first truly comprehensive best of available for the artist.  For casual fans or those new to Kylie, it's a four-star great buy and a superb (if possibly overwhelming) place to start.  It contains all of her PWL hits of the 80s/90s on Disc 1, and her more adventurous and diverse records of the later 90s and 00s on Disc 2 along with two high-quality new tracks (\\"I Believe In You\\" and \\"Giving You Up\\").  It's cross-licensed from multiple labels (PWL, BMG, EMI), which makes it especially complete.   <br /> <br />Devoted Kylie fans are likely to already have everything on this compilation except the two new tracks, which are probably not worth the price of admission since they can be downloaded (legally) for much less money.  There are also some odd A&R decisions on display here, like the inclusion of \\"Celebration\\" (a karaoke retread of the Kool & the Gang track that was a throwaway extra on a UK \\"Greatest Hits\\" years ago) and the exclusion of \\"What Kind of Fool\\" and \\"If You Were With Me Now\\" both of which were big, original hits for Kylie.  Capitol US broke nary a sweat putting this set out, with virtually zero promotion and an identical tracklisting to the British version released by Parlophone months earlier in the U.K.  In fact, Capitol should have included the US radio version (the actual US hit version) of \\"Love At First Sight\\" -- one of Kylie's biggest hits in the US -- instead of the album version.  The US radio version has NEVER been available to buy on a US release except on multi-artist compilations and on the vinyl 12\\" single.  Why?  Capitol might also have thought to include \\"Butterfly,\\" a significant club hit for Kylie in the US immediately prior to \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head.\\"  Why they didn't, who knows? These extras might have made US-based Kylie fanatics more likely to be excited by \\"Ultimate Kylie,\\" but as it stands it's a nice addition to the already crowded field of Kylie best-of compilations available, both domestically andon import.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow is their most successful album and widely recognized as one of the best albums of the psychedelic era. This is the first album featuring vocalist Grace Slick whose image and strong vocals helped make the band become '60s superstars. However, the former vocalist from The Great Society's biggest contribution to the band are the two songs she brought with her, \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\", two of the best singles from the late '60s, which became the band's biggest hits.<br /><br />Unlike their future releases, Surrealistic Pillow puts less emphasis on their stellar musicianship and more emphasis on writing good songs. Strong tracks such as \\"My Best Friend\\", \\"D.C.B.A.-25\\", and \\"How Do You Feel\\" with their memorable melodies and excellent harmonies actually sound closer to bands like The Mamas and The Papas than to the psychedelia that the Airplane were known for. Marty Balin's songs are all very good whether it's the reminiscent folk of \\"Comin' Back To Me\\", the haunting ballad \\"Today\\", or the hard rockers \\"She Has Funny Cars\\", \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\", and \\"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds.\\" Although his playing is lower in the mix than on future releases, you can already hear Jack Casady forming his own signature style as his bass work is a highlight on \\"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\\", \\"Somebody To Love\\", and \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover.\\" Rounding out the original tracks is Jorma Kaukonen's memorable acoustic instrumental \\"Embryonic Journey\\" which recently gained exposure to a whole new generation as it was played in the closing moments of the Friends series finale. As with all of the band's classic albums, Surrealistic Pillow has been remastered and includes several bonus tracks. \\"In The Morning\\" and \\"Come Back Baby\\" are great blues songs which highlight Kaukonen's stellar guitar playing while \\"Go To Her\\" and \\"J.P.P. McStep B. Blues\\" are more in line with the psychedelic pop that comprises the original tracklist. There are also mono versions of the hits \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit.\\" Overall, a classic '60s album that along with Volunteers is their best work. Highly recommended.lso mono versions of the hits \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit.\\" Overall, a classic '60s album that along with Volunteers is their best work.

And I always thought \\"Maxwell's...Hammer\\" was fun to hear once in a while for its dark humor and catchy bass line. <br /> <br />Buying this just to have side 2 in its entirety is well worth the investment.

Does that sound like some horrible novelty act? It kinda does, doesn't it? But in fact \\"I am a bird now\\" is one of the most emotionally intense, sincere and beautiful albums I've heard in a very long time.

B00005MP58|5.0|I have become a big fan of the British 'costume dramas' and this has to be the best of the bunch. It has more romance, suspence and majesty than, for example, Emma or Sense and Sensibility.  <br />The Andrew Davies adaptation from Austin's book is superb and the casting is a masterstroke. They stayed away from using world famous cinemtaic names such as Emma Thompson and utilised 'relative' unknowns outside of the UK. Colin Firth as Darcy is  fantastic, brooding and evasive. The sisters are as diverse in personality as one could wish. Jeniffer Ehle as Elizabeth has that rare quality of a beauty thats grows on you to become truly deep. Both their acting skills are perfect in this film but really gets swept away by the acting of the more flamboyant characters. Alison Steadman as Mrs Bennet brings tears to my eyes. Her manner, attitude, belief in her Daughters being the highlight of society and her relationship with her husband is a pleasure to watch. Benjamin Whitrow playing 'Mister Bennet' as his wife would often shout is beautifully dry and sarcastic. Perhaps the greatest character acting is portrayed by David Bamber as Mr Collins. He is the most oily, greasy obsequious character I have ever come across and the way he tilted his head and rubs his hands 'oh, cousin Elizabeth' is one of the highlights for me. <br />One to watch when you have a spare few hours and you need reminding how wonderful life and love is.
B000002UB6|4.0|The original title for this album was \\"Get Back\\" because - after years of experimentation, the Beatles were ready to return to their routes.  I for one don't recall their routes involving Phil Spector.  Still, the album contains many great songs, which I have enjoyed listening to again and again.  \\"Two of Us\\" is one of my favorite Beatles songs, as is \\"Let it Be.\\"  Other goodies include \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" \\"For You Blue,\\" \\"Get Back\\" and \\"One After 909.\\"  Then we have the complete duds \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\" which should never have come out.  But on the whole this is a very good, enjoyable album.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|From the director of academy award winning Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki brings to us his personal first, Nausicaa of The Valley of The Wind.  This epic fantasy is based off the manga, and shortend to bring it to the delight of fans everywhere.<br /><br />Nausicaa takes place a thousand years after a global war which left many parts of the earth covered in toxins an unihabital to humans, but not to bugs which are literally the size of houses.  Nausicaa, the princess of the Valley of the Wind, leds the people of the Valley of the Wind, which is one of the places still populated, with courage and heart unlike any other. The people look to her for strength and reasurance when they are invaded by an empire looking to awaken one of the Giant Warriors to exterminate the bugs they view as the problem of the toxins.  This remains untrue due to Nausicaa's discovering it is in fact that these bugs protect the forest which are slowly cleansing the earth of the toxins.  it is now left up to her to stop the empire's that threaten the vally from angering the bugs and destroying the world.<br /><br />This epic fantasy focuses on the environment and a possible future which could happen years from now if nations keep waring and destroying the earth.  Its a touching tale one sure to keep you on the edge of your seat, and im not just saying that.  It goes from one susupensful scene to another as you watch Nausicaa strive to save her home and her people: she sacrifice everything to save them.  The music in this film is also absoluting enchanting, i love films with great music and this one tops it off. Plus it has such vivid color and imagination that you forget that its a movie and not the real thing.  Its simply breath taking.<br /><br />I personally love the japanese voice track myself, but with an all star cast doing the english track, and you can tell the hard work they put into it to make the story flow right and stick to the original script, it makes it doubly enjoyable.  While i do think they could have gotten a better voice for Nausicaa in the English track all the other voices are A+.

B00005V1Y0|4.0|the first film installment from Baz Luhrman's Red Curtain series. Though predictable, this is a wonderful and fresh introduction of Baz's both directorial wit, eccentricity and positive genius to the Aussie film industry and Cannes.  We can clearly relate the elements that made Moulin Rouge \\"Mouline Rouge\\". Nice production design and play of language.  Needs improvement though on some film elements like frame composition and some bit players not knowing what to do in front of the camera. but this film is generally funny, engaging, great rhythm and editing.  Nice to know also that Baz was a former ballroom dancer in the special features. :) <br /> <br />Also, I was surprised when I realized that this film/dvd was released by Miramax and the Red Curtain Trilogy Box was released by Fox. Breakthough negotiations i guess for Baz. Got the box (which I heard is now OOP) before I complain of the sky high price in the future... no plug intended. <br />

B00007GZR0|4.0|Following on from the success of Pillow Talk (1959) and Lover Come Back (1962), the stars teamed up for the last time in this amusing romantic comedy. <br /> <br />The set-up is slightly different this time: Day and Hudson are married; he's a hypochondriac who gets the wrong end of the stick and thinks he's only got a few weeks to live, and tries to make the best of the rest of his life without his wife finding out. <br /> <br />It's all pretty funny, and delightfully entertaining, excellently performed as you'd expect from the line-up. Some nice turns in the supporting cast, too.
B00000IQV7|5.0|This is sort of a \\"balancer\\" film and dvd for me. very enlightening and affective. beyond profits and professions, this film was produced mainly to honor the real Patch Adams. as a dvd collector, i have realized that this expensive hobby puts me in a higher place to be educated, not merely to be entertained.  a singular blessed act of compassion, though minute, may and might make this world a better place. &lt;--- every dreamer's dream.  this film forced me to realize that people who can buy nice things (that) cost money (from Schindler's List), should continue to help and help and help and help.. especially in the midst of crisis and societal imbalance. no second thoughts or opinions about this film, its transfer or its release. <br /> <br />bow..  :)
B00005JNEI|1.0|Honesty in writting is important.  There were several statements or assertions in this book that are know false to me. As a novel or work of fiction, this book would be acceptable but I think the author means to put forth these stories as fact or at least possibilities.  He doesn't seem to present valid references or sources for his claims and in many cases his writing borders on fabrication.  All in all, I gave him a low grade, for he seems rather partisan and unballanced in his presentation of information.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Well crafted film with pristine transfer and original plot. in the middle of the film,  i thought i knew who keyser soze is.... hey! what do you know? <br /> <br />this is a fully loaded double sided dvd which promises the audience focused features and the usual clear MGM transfer. the 5.1 Sound is admirable though the sound level has not been equalized. great package nevertheless..
B000092ZYX|4.0|\\"Hail To The Thief\\" is a musical oxymoron: Warm yet cold, distant yet intimate, eerie yet lovely. While it doesn't quite work up to the eerie purity of past albums like \\"Kid A,\\" Radiohead has crafted an album that manages to mix experimental electronics and rock'n'roll in equal measure. And it does it pretty darn well.<br /><br />It opens with a strange electronic sputter, which slowly melts into a guitar melody, and the sound of Thom Yorke eerily singing, \\"Are you such a dreamer/to put the world to rights?\\" Otherworldly sound effects and entrancing rock music continue all through this album, with Yorke's singing warming up those cold songs.<br /><br />The heart of these songs seems to be helplessness and sorrow; even panoramic piano pop like \\"Sail To the Moon\\" seems unhappy. But there are also eerie melodies, sweaty tribal pop, and chilly electropop laced with explosive percussion. There's even the acoustic \\"Go To Sleep,\\" a folky number that stands alone in this blippy rock collection.<br /><br />If you pick it apart, \\"Hail To The Thief\\" echoes Radiohead's past work: the styles of \\"The Bends,\\" \\"Kid A,\\" and others can be heard woven in there. For most bands, this would be a disaster. But Yorke and his band actually make it work -- their sound gets a little cluttered at times, yet the fusion of musical styles is nothing short of astounding.<br /><br />\\"Hail\\" is not Radiohead's best album -- it doesn't have the intensity and purity that some of their other collections do. But it does pack a punch. Radiohead's \\"fusion\\" sound seems very cold and mechanical... until the melodies change. Sometimes it's an explosive riff or a rhythmic drum, or the whole song will simply speed up. The melody will warm up for a moment, only to get chilly again when it slows.<br /><br />But a lot of the atmosphere has to be credited to Thom Yorke; while Yorke is often dissed for his high, dispassionate voice, here he seems to have emotions boiling just under the surface. And the odd note of his voice makes him sound almost ghostly. Which suits the music, by the way -- would a more robust voice sound as good against a cold, eerie backdrop?<br /><br />\\"Hail To The Thief\\" uses most of Radiohead's past styles, and mishmashes them together into a surprisingly good album. Eerie, despairing and thoroughly entrancing.note of his voice makes him sound almost ghostly.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|when i saw this film, first things that popped in to my mind are The Terminal and the album U2 All That You Can Leave Behind. the film started in the airport's arrival area and the tone, in an instant, was establish. the message of the whole movie was communicated and the simple yet complex concept of love was explained in the first 2-3 minutes of the film. though this would not be eligible for a criterion release, i have learned to like this film for its direct approach. no gravy-like or cotton candy coating. this film is a compilation of the simple truths and realistic presentations of love---- happy, thrilling, unpredictable and sometimes sad.  visually, the film contains high and low points.  the plot, not really as magnificent as Shakespeare, but this is all i need... a nice break... <br /> <br />audio and OST (which i purchased separately) are commendable.. while video may need a little improvement but nevertheless at par and i consider above average in presenting this vivid aspect of one of the two strongest emotion (anger being the other one). <br /> <br />this dvd is not in my priority list for purchase this season but boy i was glad to have it. thanks to the edited korean release info i was absolutely forced to get the R1 instead...  nice companion for xmas.. <br />
B000025558|5.0|In the year 2000, Radiohead ditched its former \\"real\\" rock sound for Pink-Floydian, electronic post-rock. The result was \\"Kid A,\\" where they relearned everything they knew about music from scratch. Some people loved it. Some didn't get it, and felt it was \\"pretentious.\\" But there's one undeniable thing -- this chilly, eerie collection is a marvelously complex piece of work.<br /><br />An ominous keyboard melody and gibberish vocals open the album in \\"Everything In Its Right Place,\\" sounding a bit like a possessed radio. Then the fuzz and hums kick in, adding a spacey dimension to an already strange melody. A drum melody kicks in in the title track, followed by the ghostly rock of \\"National Anthem\\" and unearthly lament of \\"How to Disappear Completely.\\"<br /><br />Another \\"real\\" rock song kicks in with the darkly desperate \\"Optimistic,\\" flanked by a pair of softer, eerie songs. \\"Idioteque\\" throws all the rules out the window with sharp percussion backed by weird waves of sound and Thom Yorke's high vocals. And finally it ends on the same note it began -- a stately organ -- in the harp-accented \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack.\\"<br /><br />In a musical world where anything that has a guitar can be called \\"rock,\\" it's difficult to find music that is really creative. It's even harder to find a band that is willing to take risks, and expand their art. But those things can be found in Radiohead, and the evidence is in \\"Kid A\\" -- whether listeners think it's a wild success or a pretentious failure, it has to be admitted that it takes guts to try out something this different.<br /><br />Thom Yorke's vocals are often described as whiny, but they are suited to the music here. Sometimes it's as little as backing \\"ooh oohs,\\" and sometimes he's lamenting about ice ages and suicidal cries of \\"This isn't happening/I'm not here.\\" Do the lyrics make sense? Not at first glance, at least -- they're more like a part of the music than lyrics in themselves.<br /><br />And hoo boy, the music. Few bands do panoramic electronic soundscapes as Radiohead does here, scratched with wailing voices and eerie noises. More ordinary instruments are included, but add to the strange atmosphere rather than grounding it -- razor-sharp percussion, mellow organ, rippling harp strings, and subtle, swelling strings.<br /><br />The Radiohead of \\"Kid A\\" is looking at a bleak, cold place, but not one that is ugly or alienating. Instead, you just want to sink into it and experience its beauty, no matter how cold or bleak it is. A true modern classic.o boy, the music.

0767812387|3.0|When I placed this disc on my player I had no idea that by the time the credits popped up I would have two completely unexpected people on my mind as the heroes of the movie, with their cameos: the black woman dancer featured at what is supposed to be Santiago de Cuba, the one who is first seen at the window fanning herself, and who descends to the dance floor to go into a frenzied whirl of hips. Oh, God, does anybody know who she is? I tried to track her name on the credits lists, but she wasn't there. That was some dancing. Even the camera had problems to totally capture her movements! I wish she was featured on the finals. My second hero, who I didn't expect to see on the flick, is my fellow-countryman (Angolan) Ricardo Lemvo who makes an appearance for an electrifying rendering of his super-hit \\"Mama Kiyelele\\" with his Makina Loca. Please tell me who that dancer in \\"Santiago de Cuba\\" is ...
B000002JSP|1.0|Led Zeppelin finally ran out of steam with this last album and showed how a band can be tremendously popular and abysmally unoriginal simultaneously. Led Zeppelin was a band that already had its audience in place when it debuted in 1969 thanks to a band named Cream that in fact, created that audience several years earlier. It is Cream to whom Led Zeppelin owes a huge debt of gratitude to, yet in all of the interviews that I've read or heard with Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, they act as if Cream never existed. It is obvious why this is so, and someone like Plant is well aware of it. Cream was a great band, because they took the music of their time to a new plateau and created a heavy and wildly innovative musical style that spawned countless imitators who never quite rose to their level, beginning with Led Zeppelin. Was Zeppelin a good band? Yes they were, in my opinion. But were they a great band like Cream was? The answer is clearly no, because Led Zeppelin failed to take the music to another level, or give it a new dimension of some type. Cream did all the musical heavy-lifting and trail-blazing years before, allowing a band like Led Zeppelin to come along after them. But anything that Led Zeppelin did musically had already been done easily by Cream and then some. Did Led Zeppelin do anything that Cream had not already done? Absolutely not, and again, that is the huge difference between a great band like Cream and merely a good band like Led Zeppelin.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Sadly, people are still clinging to the illusion that Britney Spears, like Madonna before her, ever had a voice.  She didn't.  She has a sleazy \\"Personality\\" and the ability to shake that money-maker.  Just give her another 5 years boys, and that bod will sink faster than the Titanic.  So will her appeal.  Oops!  It's already sinking.  The people writing 5 star reviews here must be the only ones buying this meandering mess.
B0002X314C|5.0|I recently bought this cd after I watched John Legend perform on BET,106 and park's Christmas Special.  I was amazed and delighted to hear someone play so beautifully on the piano, and then back it up with a great voice.  He is very gifted, and his talented hands play the piano like there is no tomorrow.  This cd has so much to offer.  Every song is a new adventure and awakening surprise.  Who would of though that I would be able to listen to every track on this cd and enjoy it?  This cd has meaning and touches the souls of the broken hearted lovers, and the many women in the world that are taken for granted and not respected by their lovers.  John Legend gives you a gospel  but Stevie Wonder style with his music.  I await to see where John Legend will take us next?

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have to say, usually I don't really like musicals that much. I went to this movie with some of my friends thinking, \\"Well, it probably won't be that good because the reviews have been really bad. It'll be fun though.\\" But I saw this movie and FELL IN LOVE with the musical!!! I love it, I love it, I love it! Gerard Butler was awesome. Patrick Wilson was okay, in a Raul kind of way. Emmy Rossum was so great, she's like my idol now. Anyway, I suggest to anyone: whether you like musicals or not, see this movie! Even if you don't care for the music, the sets are gorgeous. It is well worth watching. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!
B000000H5J|5.0|There is nothing else in all of Fear Factory's discography that can match this one.  It is a classic, no questions.  \\"Replica\\" is still the best song that FF has done, and it shows, as being their choice of closing song on the Jagermeister Tour last year.  My favorite songs from Demanufacture are Demanufacture, Replica, New Breed, Body Hammer, and Zero Signal.  The whole cd is awesome, and will remain in my possesion until I die.  If you don't own this cd, and are an industrial/metal fan, buy it.  If you don't, you are completely missing out.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was very impressed with the cleanliness of this re-masted DVD edition. All of the blue screen shadows have been removed entirely and the audio is epic. I hear a lot from the \\"purists\\" out there who want to see the theatrical release on DVD I say NO. These minor improvements only add to the movie.
B000002513|5.0|Spectacular work by Springsteen.  I like this because it is different from what one would expect (after hearing Born in the USA).  This is like comparing fine wines; they are just different.  When you play this CD you will feel good about yourself.  Darkness on the Edge of Town is my other favorite Boss CD; but for a different and more melancholy frame of mind.  The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle is the first in a trilogy that turns into Born to Run and then Darkness On the Edge of Town.  And what a stunning trip that is.  Just sit back and let the album speak for itself.
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|My goodness, people listen to this by choice?  I hear very few redeeming qualities besides a lot of spiky, punk energy reminiscent of the early eighties new wave bands.  There's little of the invention that characterized the New York scene, though.  These guys would have been better off taking another 4-5 years to put their ideas and musical chops together.  Now on the album-tour-album cycle, I don't know how they'll do the growth necessary to make the music any better.  Time will tell, I suppose.
055357342X|5.0|I love the fire and ice trilogy.  I personally think it is the best fantasy that has ever been written, and cannot conceive of anything that could possible be better.  Characters that just feel real.  Moments that literally take your heart and squeeze it, but it never feels like you are being manipulated.  Action that is intense but not fake.  My only advice is this, do not start this series if you are not ready for it.  <br /> <br />Take everything that was good about Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings, multiply it by 5 and you have this book.  It is a rollercoaster an this is the ride of your life.  I read it in one longe session and then immediately started it again.
0385510454|2.0|It seems that the plot is an excuse for Grisham to explain why he enjoys Italy.  As many other reviewers said the discussion of Bologna was fun, especially because Grisham loved the city.  Plot was not believable or even important.  <br /> <br />The book was totally lacking in suspense and was far fetched.  The saving grace is that the book had no pretense.  It was just a pleasant diversion on two plane trips.  I am not sure how one rates.
0553579908|5.0|If you have read the book, then you know that it is great, and I have nothing to say that has not been said by better people.  The five star people are right. <br /> <br />If you have read game of thrones and hated it (which I cannot imagine), then do not bother continuing with Clash of Kings because it is just like the first. <br /> <br />If you read Game of Thrones, loved it, and have not read Clash of Kings yet, then know this.  The book is good.  Real good.  The first was not a fluke.  This man has talent that is scary.  You will not be disappointed.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The Big Lebowski may be the greatest American comedy since Dr. Strangelove.  Its critical rejection, neglect by the academy awards, and poor box office showing remain inexplicable to me.  Apparently the post-Fargo expectations did not conform with what resulted.  I have this to say: Fargo pales in comparison to the Big Lebowski and people should have been enthusiastic about such an explosion of creativity and talent as they received with this most unique of comedies.  'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is the only other movie that has ever made me laugh as much.  I guess the Big Lebowski just wasn't 'commercial' enough.   <br />   <br />     In singing its praises there are hundreds of places to begin.  John Goodman's explosive performance as Walter is the first thing that comes to my mind; he is phenomenal and should have been showered with awards.  As a slightly unhinged, tempermental, loudmouthed, incompetent war veteran who is neurotically obsessed with Vietnam and his ex-wife he is jaw-droppingly funny.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is a standout as a chuckling, uptight, obsequeous toady.  Jeff Bridges fits right into his role as The Dude, one of the only unemployed pot-smoking bums to be the hero of a movie.  The dialogue is electrifying, the acid flashbacks are weird and funny, the sountrack is used to beautiful effect, and the plot unfolds in the most convoluted way possible, until we come to the ultimate anti-climactic denouement, that will irritate many and have others choking with laughter.  This is what the Coen Brothers should be remembered for.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|After Iron Maiden made a monstrous comeback with classic singer Bruce Dickinson on \\"Brave New World\\", many hoped that \\"Dance of Death\\" would more or less be \\"Brave New World\\" Part 2.  However, \\"Dance of Death\\" is a Maiden mixed bag that features what has kept the band around this long, and also the flaws in the group's songwriting abilities.  \\"Montsigur\\" and \\"Face in the Sand\\" are prime examples of these flaws, while the title track and especially \\"Paschendale\\" are classic Maiden tunes that are reminiscent of their \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"Somewhere in Time\\" days.  Bruce's voice still soars, and the triple threat guitar work still works backed by the immortal bass work by Steve Harris, but \\"Dance of Death\\" sadly falls flat for half of the disc.  Despite that, there's still some pure Maiden moments here, but don't go in expecting the instant classic that was \\"Brave New World\\".

B00004YX39|5.0|Classic rock to the max. I Lived my life to this rock and got layed\\"because of it\\" on very numerous occasions. S.D. will live forever.
B00028HBKM|3.0|I suppose the best way to begin is to show you somewhat where I stand. I thought Gibson's 'Braveheart' was one of the most vile, disgusting pieces of filth ever made. (Historical inaccuracies, glorification of violence, flat out false hoods, openly biggoted comments, the very UNSUBTLE attacks on gay people, and the totally amoral glofification of people getting killed.) On the other extreme, his \\"Hamlet\\" was very beautifully done. A little different from Shakespeare's masterpiece, but nothing that really hurt the play. This movie is somewhat in the middle. The scenery is ok. The costumes are alright. And there are some interesting character portrayals. (Pilate and Simon of Cyrene) It is an interesting watch, but it lacks the indepth scholarship of \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" (1977). If you are looking for a movie that has deep character development as well as some really educated speculation, than you are probably better off with Franco Zeffirelli's \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" (1977). But this version is worth giving a watch to as well.
B0002OERI0|2.0|this is definetly green days worst cd. They have become sell outs...they used to be so cool, they have ruined it. they have slapped there original fans in the face and now just write music for money. hopefully they figure out what they have done and go back to there old way.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd is the most creative, inspirational and unique band ever created. No doubt. They are true talents with a constant desire to experiment and compose works of art that will last for at least decades into the future. Please, ignore all the kid's reviews and forgive them for their narrow-minded and immature opinions. Although this album is very different from other, earlier albums, I highly recommend it for it musical genious as well as the thought-provoking themes, and the visible effort that went into the album's creation. This is unlike the album's of today's music which are pointless, repetitive, and show that the artist or band put absolutely no thought into its creation, since music in the present is all about getting rich with the least effort possible.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have never heard of this show when it was on the air. A friend of mine loaned me his DVD set and I'm so glad he did. Even though it is only 14 episodes, I can truly say that it was one of the greatest shows ever. The thing that makes it so good is it's rewatchabilty. I can watch these episodes over and over and not get tired of them. I have seen it 6 times so far and I find something new and fun everytime. Even if you know the story by heart, the characters just make you smile. Another thing is that I think this show can be enjoyed by alomst everyone. I showed a couple episodes to my grandpa and after seeing it he went out and bought his first DVD player so he could watch the show! I have 600 DVD's and this is my favorite. I think your doing yourself a great diservice if you don't add this to your collection!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This film was amazing. It is one of my favorite movies I have seen. This movie is a must see! I recommend to you all to see this movie.
B0007GADZO|5.0|I give Vai a lot of credit for reinventing himself. After listening to the CD once through I was a little thrown off, in a good way that is. Vai managed to outdo himself again coming up with some very original wild new sounds on the guitar. I haven't had the chance to dig into the lyrics yet but the playing is superb. Two words describe Vai's playing on this CD: 1) clever & 2) tasteful. Vai doesn't really go nuts with the pyrotechnics but rather goes for playing the right notes at the right time. The overall sound and feel is somewhat \\"raw\\" in nature. Maybe Vai was going for that feel? Thanks again VAI and congratulations on a job superbly done!!!
B000005HLV|4.0|This release by Mayhem is a pure full throttle assault on the senses.  I got this cd december 2003 and really, I didn't listen to it at all for a very long time, perhaps a year or so.  The songs didn't click, I didn't see what the hype was, and sadly I was dissapointed with Mayhem aside from Freezing Moon. Yet, I put this back in the player a few months ago and was blown away. The riffs on this cd scream evil, very reminiscent of Dark Throne, yet a much  thicker and insane tone is used. The vocals are pretty unique, and the drums by Hellhammer are of course, amazing. I won't get into the background of the band, and the horrors that lie within Mayhem, but this cd does prove one thing: Unlike most types of music, black metal is a lifestyle. No typical human is going to listen to this and like it and be obsessed with it until it becomes the essence of their being. The melodies are beautiful, you just have to have an ear for them and have an aestheitic view on their simplicity. <br />The best songs are Funeral Fog, Freezing Moon, Pagan Fears, and Life Eternal.  <br />Because this cd affected me in such an odd way, and because it took such a long time to appreciate I simply cannot give it 5 stars. Yet, this cd does not really seem to tire on me. I could listen to Freezing Moon 100 times in a row and I think I would be fine with it, unlike say listening to Run to the Hills 100 times in a row. I would recommend listening to this while driving, thinking, or on an excursion in the woods or something. Classic Black Metal that sums up the era, gives off a great feeling/mood, and embraces the listener in a way many cds cannot.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|This movie was OK, it was kind of disturbing, but it was OK, The acting of Cary Lewis, I thought, was pretty bad. I really, really, did not like the ending. Other people who I have talked to said this movie was dumb, and I agree with them. The people who thought this movie was good, you obviously have no good taste in movies and believe me, I know movies, and I know when or when not to recommend them to people and this is one that I would not recommened.
0393035158|2.0|This book is one of several written by propagandists seeking to create a climate in which Muslims can be persecuted for who they are, rather than what they do. By building a case for such collective punishment through a rational step-by-step process, the author uses a logical process to point to conclusions that are pernicious and dangerous.    This books' basic assertion is reasonable: that the literal interpretation of religious scripture is inconsistent with modern life. The author, as an example, references a section of the Bible where treatment of slaves is discussed, but where slavery is not condemned. I think most rational thinkers today would agree that it is simplistic to interpret ancient religious texts literally, or to consider them to be anything other than guides. The author notes inconsistencies between the Bible and our normal daily life in a good humored way, with observations that are hardly original. He also briefly references other religions, for instance the inherent pacifism of Jainism.    Islam is, however, clearly in his crosshairs. The religion warrants a full chapter early in the book. The author quotes fierce and aggressive passages from an English translation of the Koran at length. He then points out that the Koran is taken as the literal word of God by Muslims, and that it is referenced by extremists and suicide bombers. (He neglects to point out that suicide bombing is a recent phenomenon that can be traced to the Palestinian/Israeli intifada. In the prior 1600 years of Islamic civilization there is no history of suicide bombing in Islam).    So far so good. Nuts of every stripe find ways to justify their insanities, and find ways to rationalize the taking of innocent life, whether it be Jim Jones in Guyana, or the kamikaze pilots of Japan.    But the author does not allow Islam to remain within the family of religions that have inspired both good and bad over the ages. He seeks instead to create the following logic:     1. Islam is areligion obsessed with death, killing and martyrdom. It is therefore fundamentally a dangerous religion, and we are at war with the religion itself (extensive quotations from the Koran, public opinion polls, etc).     2. Muslims cannot convert from Islam, on pain of death. Therefore, all Muslims are Islamic, and all should be suspect. In particular, educated Muslims in Western countries (I presume he means to include Muslims who could refute his fatuous arguments). There are no moderate Muslims, and there cannot be.     3. Therefore, all Muslims are tainted, and should be identified and treated differently as a class (perhaps, with a crescent on their forehead?), based on their Muslim identity at any point in their lives. I presume Muslim names are easy to screen from databases. In his perverse logic, there can be no such thing as a \\"secular\\" or moderate Muslim, though there can be secular individuals born to other faiths. I presume what he really means is that a Muslim claiming to be secular should still be watched closely, as you never know when he might turn religious! He seems to have watched the Manchurian Candidate one too many times.       4. Ergo, it is reasonable to deprive Muslims of their individual rights, soleley based on their being Muslim, in the name of our security.    This is the frightful prescription that emerges from this book. In other words, we must terrorize the Muslims among us to protect our security, that this is a necessary evil.       Not that long ago, a far wiser person wrote the following:    \\"Terror is no longer used as an instrument to exterminate and frighten opponents, but as an instrument to rule masses of people who are perfectly obedient...its victims are innocent even from the point of view of the persecutor...full terror is directed against people with certain common characteristics which are independent of their specific behavior...\\"     The writer was Hannah Arendt, in \\"The Origins of Totalitarianism\\", as she was writing in1968 about the origins of anti-Semitism. I recommend a reading of this book in order to properly put in context the shameless attempts underway these days (such as via this book) to turn Muslims into the Jews of the 21st century.
B00005JN4H|3.0|This movie is a good rental, but I wouldn't buy it, I like Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon so I thought the cast was pretty good. There were some pretty funny parts, One part I was crying because I was laughing so hard. Like I said it is a good rental movie if your looking for something stupid-funny too watch.
0679721037|5.0|\\"Hiroshima\\" by John Hersey is true story about August 6, 1945 when one action would forever change the course human history. The day that first atomic bomb was used against other people. Mr. Hersey tells about people who were just going about their everyday business. A Doctor, an office worker, a priest and others.  And how one event would effect them for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />This should be a must read for everyone, because this what war is all about. Not glory, lose of life and untold suffering.
1881273156|5.0|I strongly recommended this book, I had never read such a book, where one could describe throughly the languages of love in such simple words and great examples as Dr. Chapman did...the book is so easy to follow thru, very true examples to our everyday life, I believe this book not only help your relationship but also a valuable tool to pass on the generations..<br />Thankyou Dr Chapman, you're a wiseman..
B00064MW6A|1.0|Reminder, possible plot points marked with ###s<br /><br />Well i finally saw what some have called the worst train wreck in recent memory. While i can see where some might have a problem with it, ive got to say that i was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It had a rich plot with deep character development. The visuals were amazing and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I never knew what was going to happen next and i couldnt believe how much this movie blew me away. Hallie really prooved how worthy she was of that Oscar!<br /><br />Now take all that i just said, flip it to its polar opposite, and youll find my feelings for this movie.<br /><br />Lets see, Patience Prince becomes Catwoman and comes to battles equiped with a whip and cleavage. Got it, cause thats really all there is here.<br /><br />Wow! Ive got to say that im glad this monstrosoty no longer darkens my dvd player. I had to put it in one last time to see the deleted scenes. I thought perhaps my guests had went through enough torture and didnt want to see any more so we didnt watch them that night. Sorry if anyone wanted to see them, but trust me you missed about as much quality as the movie itself so no worries.<br /><br />Hmmmm, where to begin. Hallie? Well, she certianly spit out the lines. With about as much talent as a blind person controlling air traffic. Seriously, did she suddenly go retarded? I expected her to pull an Ed from 'Crank Yankers' an express how much she 'Had to go poopie!' Somebody get her a litterbox stat! A friend mentioned she couldnt believe that Hallie got paid 22 million dollars to be in this movie and i corrected her. \\"No, they paid Hallies T1+S 22 million to be in this movie.\\"<br /><br />Shall we move on to the \\"cat\\" aspect of this film? Oh i believe we shall! Theres a specific funny/creepy moment that comes to mind ### when Patience gets a ball thrown at her and she starts rubbing it up against her face. As she appears to be close to \\"really enjoying herself\\" proportions she suddenly stops. The old woman smiles and simply says \\"Catnip\\". ### And then the old woman says \\"Keep going, i was enjoying that.\\" Not really, but at least it wouldve been funnier than anything else in this movie. Well besides the movie itself that is.<br /><br />Some of this movie was just plain stupidity that there was no way i could handle. ### Why the need for cgi cats? Batman Returns used real cats for the scene this movie ripped off and that was a couple of years ago! Just because the technology advances doesnt make it right to use it okay? ### And let me tell you a thing or two about Patiences love interest, Cop Guy! ### He has two things she has written 'Sorry' on. One he knew came from Patience, the other he knew came from Catwoman. He takes them to get analyzed by an 'expert' (lets use that term so loosely its in danger of falling off) that says \\"Oh theres no way these two people are the same. See this word is timid and this word is angry! Nope nope nope, two different people.\\" AND THE FRICKEN COP JUST TAKES THAT!!!!!!! ARRRRRGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!! ### Im telling you theres never been a moment in cinematic history that more made me wish id had one of those suicide booths from Futurama.<br /><br />Final note. I couldnt even stand Alex Borstien in this movie! Thats a gigantic testament to its disgustivity. Unless you go into it fully understanding its something to make fun of, then i wouldnt suggest watching it. I usually try to close with some kind of joke but i...i just cant...<br /><br />Final Grade: *puke*ing herself\\" proportions she suddenly stops.

B00005JNJ7|5.0|The movie is with manicans people. So they are having sex, deal with it! You conservative nazi's make me sick with your squemish nonsense. The entire premiss of the movie is to mock everyone in the world and describe how screwed up politic's are. Meanwhile, your ranting and raving about how kids shouldn't see a naked puppet. Well, congradulations, you've hit it lower than Fox and ABC, who won't even allow Robin Williams to say the word \\"Faggot\\" when referring to native americans during the oscars. Go see the movie people, and take your kids too. These are things they should know about, and don't sheild them from sex, it only makes it more awkward later in life.
B0006Z2LH4|1.0|After seeing Cube Zero, I must say STOP ALL CUBE SEQUELS NOW!  Cube is just one of those movies that does not need a sequel.  Cube 2: Hypercube was horrible, and this \\"attempt\\" to explain the inerworkings of the Cube missed big time. <br /> <br />What made this movie very hard to get through was the poor writing and terrible acting.  Does anyone rememeber what made the original Cube great was the cast?  They were not big names actors, but they show intensity and add a lot to their respective characters.  Here the characters are so bland. <br /> <br />Over top \\"higher Ups\\" who come in when one of their own goes into the cube.  The main guy is so over the top its not scary, but funny. <br /> <br />In this Cube they really stepped up the bar with the gore of the traps in the Cube.  That is all fine and dandy, but I rather much have better actors, better script, then money wasted on gore effects.   <br /> <br />The Original Cube had me on the edge of my seat, Cube 2 had me just watching, and this Cube Zero had me watching the clock to see when this film was going to be over. <br /> <br />Again, NO MORE CUBE SEQUELS!
6304711905|5.0|This movie has to be one of the best westerns that was ever produced.  Val Kilmer was superb as Doc Holliday and Kurt Russell played the part of Wyatt Earp very well, much better in my opinion than did Kevin Costner did in the other notable movie produced at about the same time.  This movie is full of terrific lines and characters.  It is actually a very accurate portrayal of the events that unfolded.  The only discrepancy that I noticed is that in the movie, Johhny Ringo is killed by Doc Holliday.  In reality, it remains a mystery who shot Ringo in the head.  Some say it was suicide, but nobody knows for sure.  This movie still holds as the best western in recent years.  My favorite line of the movie was when Doc says to Johnny Ringo right before he shoots Ringo dead, \\"Why, Johhny Ringo, you look like someone just walked over your grave\\".  Classic!!
6305546789|5.0|I`ve seen this film numerous times and it still is the most frightening film for me.... I still have nightmares after watching this...  It was made for very little money and has the quality of authencity and realism; yes you get the feeling it could happen in your o w n neighbourhood... Indeed - now that`s why it scares the hell out of me hehehe
B00005JNPZ|4.0|Overall, a very good movie.  Lots of laughs and well written.  Ending seemed a little too \\"easy\\" though.
B00006DEF9|4.0|overrated. As a musical review it works pretty well and there are lively scenes, most effecticly from Jean Hagen. Her impersonation of a dumb silent star(modeled after Judy Holliday who turned the part down because she felt it was  too small) is one of the great parts in movie history.<br /><br />The story is alarmingly thin and only an excuse for a singing or dancing number(\\"It`s morning - yes and what a looooooooooooovely morning.... SINGING; \\"Good Morning.... \\" to name 1 of many incidents)...<br /><br />The numbers are the best from MGM, Kelly, Donald O`Connor but works only as an excuse for showing off. However, the transition-scenes from silent to sound, the preview and the finale are treasured moments - but again - thanks to Jean Hagen.
B000002UAX|5.0|This album has some of the Beatles best music together, while they were fighting amongst themselves more than ever before.  Influenced greatly by the Beach Boys Pet Sounds, they were also experimenting different styles.  The criticism this album draws, if any, is usually because their are a few \\"filler\\" songs.  I find these songs fun and feel they add to the album.  The album starts off with the rockin' Back in the USSR.  It's a great song, but was surrounded with some controversy because of the communist threats going on at the time.  The next song is one of John's best that he wrote in India, Dear Prudence.  It is a beautiful song with John's voice in top form.  Glass Onion is a fun song that brings back a bunch of John's previous hits in the lyrics.  The next two, Wild Honey Pie and Ob-La-di Ob-La-Da I don't care for.  The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill is a fun country song.  It is one of those fun fillers I mentioned earlier.   <br /> <br />And here is the gem of the album, George's While My Guitar Gently Weeps.  He used the I Ching philosophy in writing the song.  He opened up a book to a random page and saw the words gently weeps, and wrote a song based around them.  He singing is the best I've ever heard him, and Clapton plays the guitar solo.   <br /> <br />Now I'll skip to the next great song, Blackbird, which is a beautiful song written by Paul encouraging African-Americans to fight for equal rights.  Skipping a couple more tracks we come to Don't Pass Me By, Ringo's first composition.  I personally love this song and feel it is the catchiest song on the album.  The next song, Why Don't We Do It in the Road.  This is another \\"filler\\" that I enjoy, consisting of 10 words.  The next great song, and last on the 1st disc is Julia, much a song dedicated to John's mother.   <br /> <br />On the 2nd disc, I'd say every single song is great, including the weird Revolution 9.  Overall, this is one of my favorite Beatles albums.  You can't go wrong with any of the Beatles stuff from '65-'70 though.  This is a must buy.  Enjoy.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|When u see this film u may not be surprised at the action, the animals interplaying with Snow-White and so-forth... But THIS is the first one out and every cartoon owes Disney`s SNOW-WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS immensely.<br /><br />The casting of the voices are brilliant(indeed Deanna Durbin was thought too mature in her voice) and Andrea Caselotti was subsequently cast in THE WIZARD OF OZ(1939) with a 1-liner - \\"Wherefore art thou... Romeo...\\" while the Tin-Man is singing out his despair and longings.<br /><br />She is breathtaking as Snow-White. Though Snow-White is old-fashion and have gonebye thoughs of manners and traditions compared to her sisters Ariel, Belle, Esmeralda and Pocahontas; she still gives us a link to our childhood and our childhood dreams...
B000002UAU|5.0|In 1967 the world of pop music was in a state of revolution. Psychedelism was on its way in with bands like the Grateful Dead and the Doors; Cream and Jimi Hendrix were setting the world aflame with their guitar pyrotechnics, signaling the birth of hard rock. Of course, the Beatles were in no position to let music go on without them, and so as the Summer of Love dawned after the astounding Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever single they released their new album: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.    The alleged \\"concept\\" behind Sgt. Pepper is no more or less complex than Paul McCartney has always said: assuming an alter-ego, a band putting on a concert. But the psychological implications are more powerful than and in effect direct the musical. Here we find the Beatles shedding their teeny-bopper \\"boy-band\\" image (which had been obsolete since certain parts of Help!), becoming somebody else. You can hear that in the music. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band defied and continues to defy all attempts at categorization - every song is unconventional, eccentric, different, and most importantly imaginative and original. If it weren't for the fact that each and every one has become iconic in its own right, you'd never guess all these songs were by the same band, let alone the Beatles!    Drenched in multi-tracked guitars and vocals, overdubs, dense harmonies, unusual instruments and recording techniques, vibrant imagery, and swirling experimentation, this was and remains a highly unique record. So many styles are featured it's almost dizzying: rock & roll, pop, music-hall, classical, carnival, Indian, soul, and avant-garde sound projects, to name a few. As for subject material, the songs aim more at the imagination than the heart, but several (including With a Little Help from My Friends, Getting Better, and She's Leaving Home) remain emotionally charged. It's something like a collection of interrelated short stories. Each paints a different picture, tells a different story - many are in fact stories themselves, character studies and vignettes - but in the end they're all somehow connected, by that \\"concept\\" of a band's performance. More like thirteen bands! Sgt. Pepper's seems more a psychedelic festival than a concert.    In some respects Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is overrated - #1 Album of All-Time? I love it dearly, but in no way would I account it the greatest rock & roll record ever conceived. Most Influential Album of All Time, however? That's a much more plausible moniker. This was the record that really cemented the concept of rock as an art form in the collective consciousness. This was the record that tore down so many restraints and barriers, serving as the signpost for all following acts - this was kind of where modern popular music really began. It takes you back to the Summer of Love, allowing you to relive the spirit of those days if just for a little while, forty minutes maybe; and it's a music essential whichever way you look at it.
0790729989|5.0|Because this is a landmark thriller. I remember sitting through it in a moviehouse in 1995 and it still hasn`t overstayed its welcome. The story, characters and its visual splendour arrests you immediatly and should be in every moviecollection in every household, `round the world.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|I cannot believe why - WHY - so many reviewers gave 1 or 2 stars to this movie???!!! <br /> <br />This is one of the Best movies from the last decade! <br /> <br />In one film you have the magnificent directing and acting along with a stunning and surprisingly story with characters developing in the course of the movie... <br /> <br />With subtlety... <br /> <br />THIS is not achieved by many... <br /> <br />Bravo Clint! You're the Best!
076781326X|5.0|Many filmhistorians praise the 1948 film, but Carol Reed`s adaption of the Broadway play is a miracle come true. Sit back and enjoy a landmark in the history of \\"from Broadway to Hollywood\\"-musicals:-)... This and CABARET 1972 were the truly last great musicals.... Fortunately the genre was revived through the 90s via Disney and now we can enjoy Evita, Moulin Rouge, Chicago and The Phantom of the Opera.
B0000019PA|5.0|to be honest i have never heard aeoroplane over the sea but to understand where mackey is coming from read some of his other reviews to understand his absurd tastes. for example he gave translanticism by death cab for cutie a perfect five stars and the title of his review is \\"most posiblly one of the best pieces of music i have ever heard\\". in my oppinion that is way off the mark as well as his one star review of the fiery furnaces blueberry boat. obviously this guy doesnt like music that sounds different than he thinks it should,and would rather not be surprised and or challenged by the music he listens to.i respect his oppinion but would have to say look at his other reviews before listening to his Aeroplane over the sea one.(p.s. bassed on his review of this album and his review on blueberry boat alone i will now certainly buy the album)
B00005O3VD|5.0|They weren`t sure they wanted her for the movie(\\"She`s so odd looking... even ugly at times\\") and the story tells that Barb had to submit herself to an extensive test on film in front of the Columbia executives...<br /><br />It really is a vehicle for Barbra! She dominates the film completely and no other in the cast challanges her a bit. Even so, it is a good-looking film directed by Master William Wyler(but musical scenes directed by Herbert Ross) and though Barbra`s Fanny Brice is abnormally ambitous; she still manages us to feel for her, like her, admire her and above all... care for her...<br /><br />It really is a must for drama-musical-lovers.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|To start off I would just like to state that Donnie Darko is my favorite movie.  I have been a hard core Darko fan since I saw it in theaters in 2001.  For those who haven't seen it, this DVD will be a real treat.  Donnie Darko is possibly the greatest character based sci-fi flick ever.<br /><br />That said . . .  To my fellow hard core fanatics you may want to save your twenty bucks.  The 20 minutes of extra footage can all befound within the deleted scenes of the original DVD.  For those of us who have watched the movie at great lengths to figure out all it's subtle points, having them spoon fed in this directors cut is a bit much.  Some scenes we wished were in the original, some we were okay to see go.  But the one UNFORGIVABLE act was the changing of \\"The Killing Moon\\" to \\"Never tear us apart\\"!  That song and mad world captured the feel of the original Donnie Darko like no other song could.  I bought the DVD because I wanted to see the documentary about the cult of Donnie Darko, but after hearing the new opening theme the film just somehow felt tainted.<br /><br />To all newbies, none of this will be a problem.  You will watch, and undoubtably love the movie.  But for the already hard core fans, just beware.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This is 1940. When craftmen did it by hand, not the computer. Though many segments are too boring for young children, it remains a stunning example that movies can be high art... As big as the Mona Lisa, or Edvard Munch, Picasso, the Pyramids...<br /><br />I hail it simply the best cartoon ever produced and I doubt I shall see a HANDYWORK better than this.
0385510454|3.0|Grisham manages to provide a better read than his last few books in 'The Broker'. Here the broker is Joel Backman, a previously high-flying Washington powerbroker who is now in a high-security prison with 14 years left to go. An outgoing president grants him a pardon but the plan is to leak news of his location so that atleast one of the people out to get him does get him.    The books starts off in a rather outlandish way with the president's landslide loss and rather unbelievable characters in power at the Whitehouse. And once it gets Backman to Italy, it turns into a primer on Italy and all things Italian as we follow, in much more detail than necessary, Backman's local trips, his lunches and his learning the language. The book barely moves during these portions and one could skip large paragraphs without missing anything.    The pace picks up towards the end though that is still relative compared to the first third of the book. Things feel rushed as Grisham attempts to wrap everything up in the last few chapters. And there is no sense of closure since according to the book, he is still in danger from one assassin.    Though leisurely, 'The Broker' is a good read Grisham's fast-paced thrillers like 'The Firm' and 'The Pelican Brief' seem like a thing of the past.
B0002858YS|5.0|This was one of the most welcome releases in '04.  Sure \\"Somebody Told Me\\" was overplayed, but for every rotation, it meant Britany was not.  This does take me back to the late '80's sound, with much thicker guitar backing up the electronic end.  Kind of like if New Order met Interpol. <br /> <br />\\"Brightside\\" is next up but honestly, \\"Change Your Mind\\", \\"...Things that I have done\\" are fantastic as well.  The Killers are a great change of pace and \\"Hot Fuss\\" is a great CD.
B00006JMQG|5.0|World War One sent a shockwave through the arts and one of the results was expressionism.  The term is difficult to define; in a general sense, however, it refers to a type of art that makes a statement about internal emotion and psychology.  Often linked to surrealism and cubism, in the 1920s expressionism became one of the dominate styles in visual and performing arts and was particularly associated with Germany.<br /><br />The 1919 THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI is perhaps the only film made in a purely expressionist style.  As directed by Robert Wiene and designed by Herman Warm, Walter Reimann, and Walter Rohrig, everything about the film is exaggerated, off-center, and disorienting. The sets are strange, deliberately artificial constructions of flat surfaces in odd angles and broad strokes of paint; the make-up and costumes are equally exaggerated.  The result is a unique look that has the paranoid essence of nightmare, and the story links with the visuals to remarkable effect.<br /><br />A carnival has come to a small German town, and among its attractions is Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) and \\"sonambulist\\" Cesare (Conrad Veidt).  When awakened from his sleep, Cesarea makes predictions of the future--predictions of death!  And through his power over the sleepwalker, Caligari ensures that the predictions come true.  It is frequently described as the first true horror film.  But while the story was shocking by 1919 standards, it was really the visual style of the film that outraged critics and the public alike; many described it as \\"degenerate,\\" and it proved extremely controversial where ever shown.<br /><br />It also proved incredibly influential--so much so that it is virtually impossible for any one serious about film as art to avoid it.  But there are quite a few releases that you should avoid: the film is in public domain, and the result has been a series of DVD and VHS \\"budget\\" releases that are dire to the nth degree.  It is a matter of getting what you pay for, and while the KINO release is the most expensive print available, it is also the only one worth having.  The picture quality is as good as it can be short of digital restoration and the film has been restored to its original tints as well.<br /><br />The KINO release offers a choice of soundtracks, a 43 minute version of director Robert Wiene's GENUINE: THE TALE OF A VAMPIRE, and archival footage of Wiene on the set of I.N.R.I.  While these are interesting, it is a pity that KINO did delve a little deeper; this is a film truly worthy of a double disk treatment crammed to overflowing with additional information.  But the film itself is the important thing, and where that is concerned you have the best possible.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Revieweru pay for, and while the KINO release is the most expensive print available, it is also the only one worth having.

0385510454|1.0|In the Author's Notes at the end of the book, Grisham states &quot;If something in this novel approaches accuracy, it's probably a mistake&quot;. Purchasing this book in hardcover was my mistake.<BR>He admits that his background is not in tecnology or espionage, and that he did not do any research when writing this book. This laissez faire attitude toward his craft greatly shortchanges his readers.  Other writers (Jeffery Deaver and Greg Iles come to mind) spend a great deal of energy researching their subject matter and it comes through in their work. What Grisham has done here is an amteurish hack job.<br />I have been a fan of Grisham for years, but this book was simplistic and boring. Part of what has made Grisham a bestselling author is his ability to create sympathetic characters (be they scoundrels are outright criminals). In The Broker he has failed to create a chracter who is even interesting. By the end of the book I suspect most readers will not even care what happens to the Broker.<br />If you are looking for a good spy novel try Robert Ludlum.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|I've been a Maiden fan since the early 80's, I listen to the first two albums all the time. I'm huge fan of Maiden when Paul was the lead singer. All I have to say about this DVD is, \\"it's about time\\". I never had the pleasure of seeing Maiden when Paul was in the group, but this DVD gives a great look at how it all began. I loved seeing the live old footage of the early days, and the interveiws with everyone were very interesting. <br />I give this DVD a 5 out of 5 stars, just because of the live early days perforances.

B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth's latest album is sheer brilliance.  Even though it is has all clean vocals and is predominantly mellow , it is still one of the best if not, the best album Opeth has ever released.    The songs as I stated above are all soft/mellow songs which is not typical of Opeth.  Mikael Akerfeldt never releases a single death metal growl on this album, but rather utilizes his extremely good clean vocal singing voice, which in my opnion is second to none.  Overall the musicianship is outstanding (which is expected...after all, it is Opeth), and the lyrics are some of the most poetic, beautiful lyrics Opeth have ever unleashed upon us.  There is also quite a bit of keyboard usage (provided by Steven Wilson) which I forgot to mention earlier, which blends in perfectly with the album (especially on songs like \\"In My Time of Need,\\" and \\"To Rid the Disease.\\")           1) \\"Windowpane\\"- The longest song on the album.  Great guitar solos, great song. 10/10    2) \\"In My Time of Need\\"- Another great song..beautiful mesh of guitars, and keyboards. 10/10    3) \\"Death Whispered a Lullaby\\"- Steven Wilson (from Porcupine Tree) wrote the lyrics to this song..so you know they are going to be great.  Pay attention to the lyrics though...when you figure out what the song is about, it is bone chilling (in a good way)- 10/10    4) \\"Closure\\"- Mikael Akerfeldt's voice shines brightly on this particular song.  It is predominantly an acoustic song and is majestically executed.- 10/10    5) \\"Hope Leaves\\"- Probably the most emotional song on the record.  Good overall. - 9/10    6) \\"To Rid the Disease\\"- I would be hard pressed to choose a favorite song on this record (since they are all brilliant), but if I had to pick, it would this one.  Gorgeous song overall with elegant keyboards. - 10/10    7) \\"Ending Credits\\"- An instrumental done well. - 9/10    8) \\"Weakness\\"- Haunting song overall.  Unlike any song Opeth has ever done to date.  9/10    Definitely try to check this album out...it will no doubt be one of the best purchases you have ever made..that certainly was the case for me.
