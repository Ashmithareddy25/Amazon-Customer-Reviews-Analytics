0545128285|2.0|I was somewhat disappointed in this book, after having read the entire Harry Potter series.  I think it was a mistake trying to connect the two.  The series simply overpowered this little book.  On their own, the Bard's tales were entertaining, but were totally outclassed by the weak adhesion and inevitable comparison to the Potter sagas.

B000002B35|5.0|So at this point, it's patently obvious that we are never going to get another Pink Floyd album or tour again. Rick Wright is dead, David Gilmour has stated in multiple interviews that doesn't have any more interest in the project, and without those two, it's kind of hard to imagine anything Floydian happening other than another Roger Waters solo tour with Nick Mason making the occasional cameo. This album, then, is quite definitively the last word from Pink Floyd. Yes, there will probably be the occasional remastered album or archival release, but this is the final release meant as a representation of a contemporary musical act.     Considering this, I have to say that Pulse actually does live up to the hefty burden placed upon it. There isn't anything terribly experimental on it; the band doesn't play \\"Interstellar Overdrive,\\" \\"A Saucerful of Secrets,\\" or any of the other psychedelic live reception-pieces which defined them as a musical act in the days before The Dark Side of the Moon catapulted them to international stardom. However, at this point, Pink Floyd were a bit old for that kind of thing anyways. They were an arena band and there was no way of escaping that, no matter how many rock operas Roger Waters wrote about it. Given their predicament, this is perhaps the best Pink Floyd could do: a big, flashy show with excellent sound quality, backup singers galore, and tons of cool, shiny lasers for those in the audience who were temporarily out of touch with consensus reality. The setlist is exactly what the occasion demands: a nice mixture of the hits, some of the musical highlights from The Division Bell (including stellar versions of \\"High Hopes\\" and \\"Coming Back to Life\\"), a token Barrett song, and of course, a complete performance of Dark Side of the Moon. The latter, in case you were wondering, sounds quite a lot like the studio version, except for \\"Money,\\" which is a bit longer. Considering the size of the show, however,  and the nature of producing thatkind of a spectacle, it kind of goes without saying that there is very little room for improvisation, experimental noise-jams, or anything else that would make the songs here differ significantly from the album versions. Yes, everything still sounds \\"trippy\\" enough, but be aware that this is a fine-tuned, deliberately constructed kind of \\"trippy.\\" It isn't heavy or experimental, but if anything, Pulse is as classy as it gets.     I recommend this CD to anyone interested in high-quality live recordings, arena rock, or Pink Floyd. This probably isn't the best place to start if one wants to get acquainted with the actual albums, but it's definitely a nice summation of the band's \\"arena rock' stage. In fact, this could arguably be the best arena rock tour Pink Floyd ever did, seeing as it's the only one that truly *embraces* that side of the band's music and isn't being put on either by a reluctant Roger Waters or in an attempt to upstage said Mr. Waters. Either way, it's good stuff and definitely better than what the Floyd's american counterparts in the Grateful Dead were up to at this point.
0439023483|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I was on the edge of my seat, and I couldn't put it down.<br />Okay, so not everyone who loved this book will have such strong emotions while reading it, but at the very least, it's an action-packed page-turner mixed with just enough romance.<br /><br />In a place once called North America lies the nation Panem, a well-to-do Capital surrounded by twelve struggling districts. Every year the Capital holds the deadly, last-man-standing  televised event called the Hunger Games. By law one boy and one girl from each district must participate. This is the Capital's way of showing their own power and demonstrating the twelve district's inferiority.<br /><br />When sixteen-year-old Katniss's younger sister gets chosen, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She must now fight and survive to earn her right to live. Although growing up in district twelve, where food and daily needs are hard to come by, gave her experience with survival, Katniss will face obstacles and choices more complex than the threat of starvation.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of violence, maybe too much for the younger readers but if you can handle some blood and gore it's definitely worth your time. The characters are realistic and well developed. There are funny moments for some who have a twisted sense of humor, and it has heartfelt moments as well. I can't wait for the next book!
0790742780|4.0|This movie is about a Reagan Democrat who votes Ross Perot only to end up with Bill Clinton. Naturally, he snaps. You know the rest of the story...<br /><br />\\"Falling Down\\" is a near-conservative, half-sexist and very violent movie about an angry White man, named D-Fence, who gets sick and tired of the car lines in LA, and decides to walk through the city instead. Along the way, he confronts stingy Koreans, Hispanic gangsters, a neo-Nazi shop owner and some rich White golfers. The encounters get progressively more violent, as D-Fence gets hold of more and more lethal weapons. Finally, the police is called in and tracks him down. The two police officers are arguably the most boring characters in the entire movie, real nerds!<br /><br />I'm not sure whether the movie has a real message, or whether it's simply a commercial speculation, but I suppose it's about the alienation of middle-class White males from contemporary America. Or something.<br /><br />I readily admit that I like this movie, despite the questionable political message. And no, I don't take it very seriously. It's sheer entertainment. Half of the lines and all of the absurd situations are classics. \\"Hey, I'm sorry too, Rick\\". \\"There goes a man with a smile on his face. I'm sure his ECONOMICALLY VIABLE\\". \\"Have you seen his wife? SMACK\\". My favorite character is the Black guy who protests outside a bank, which considered him economically unviable. And my favorite situation is when D-Fence takes care of the crazy Nazi guy. But hey, Rick, I'm a liberal!<br /><br />:-D<br /><br />Recommended, if you take it with a very large grain of salt...<br /><br />Breakfast, anyone?

0425166805|1.0|\\"Chariots of the Gods\\" was Erich von D&auml;niken's first book, and became an instant best-seller all over the world. It was translated to at least a dozen languages, including Swedish, Slovak, Turkish and Bengali. In Czechoslovakia, the book became so popular that the Czechoslovak Academy of Science had to publish a popularized refutation. After a visit to Turkey, a critic of D&auml;niken said: \\"Even the police officers read the book. And trust me, those guys usually don't read anything at all\\".<br /><br />\\"Chariots\\" was published in 1968. It started a craze that lasted over a decade. D&auml;niken became an international celebrity, and is still occasionally seen on Discovery and other cable networks. Naturally, he wrote a lot of sequels, and there even used to be an organization devoted to his ideas, the Ancient Astronaut Society (AAS).<br /><br />In hindsight, it's easy to laugh at D&auml;niken's sensationalist \\"revelations\\". Those were simpler times. The book is naïve, ridiculous and prejudiced. Perhaps that explains its stunning success. The book is tailored for scientifically illiterate readers. In the US, it was originally serialized in the National Enquirer. Where else? Kids believe it too. Like many other customer reviewers, I also believed in D&auml;niken when I was around 12 years old. No well-educated person can possibly be fooled by \\"Chariots of the Gods\\". If you want to fool the well-educated, please start a new religious cult!<br /><br />D&auml;niken claims that aliens from outer space visited our planet long ago. Our primitive ancestors worshipped them as gods. (How could the ape-men even have a religion? That takes intelligence.) The aliens impregnated some human females, thereby giving our evolution a tremendous boost forward. (Why have no alien DNA been found in our genes? And how can alien DNA be compatible with that of terrestrial primates?) The aliens then left, but evidence of their presence is still all around us: ancient monuments, cave paintings, the Nazca lines, the Mahabharata... (But no alien technology!)<br /><br />This entire chain of argument is breathtakingly credulous. Nor is the rest of the book much better. To D&auml;niken, the Egyptian gods can't be half-animal, for surely you don't worship what you eat for lunch? Ergo they were space aliens. Some cave paintings look like astronauts appearing in a haze. Therefore, they must *be* astronauts appearing in a haze. What could be simpler? And why would the pharaohs have ordered the mummification of their dead bodies, if they hadn't expected the space aliens to return and resurrect them? Why indeed...<br /><br />A large part of the argument is based on chronological snobbery. It's also hopelessly Euro-centric. 40 years ago, prejudiced Westerners naturally couldn't believe that ancient, \\"primitive\\" peoples in the Third World could possibly have erected large monuments. Surely, Giza, Tiahuanaco, Sacsahuaman and Easter Island must have a supernatural explanation? Parthenon and Colosseum are, of course, something else again. I suspect a large part of D&auml;niken's success is that his books, perhaps unconsciously, pander to this kind of prejudiced opinions. Another reason may be the interest in UFO's during the Cold War. But at bottom, D&auml;niken is something more than a writer pondering to the philistine.<br /><br />He is a prophet.<br /><br />His ideas make it possible to drop the old religion (Christianity), without completely dropping gods and miracles. True, the gods are really space aliens, but they are still our \\"creators\\". By turning the gods into mysterious and high-tech aliens, D&auml;niken makes it possible for modern man to re-enchant the world, while still being firmly rooted in the space age. This, I think, is the real key to the strange success of \\"Chariots of the Gods\\". D&auml;niken launched a pseudoreligion.

B001EXE2ZG|5.0|Sunset Blvd. is really a classic noir and a movie classic. I never buy movies because I never see them too many times over again. This is one of the few that is in my home library and also works as a go-to gift for my movie loving friends. It has never let me down( it doesnt hurt that this movie is on every top 100 list of all time best movies.) I personally suggest anything that Billy Wilder touched, but this is could be his best.
1400076943|5.0|Admittedly, I wanted to read Purple Hibiscus because I have thought a lot lately about Africa--its role in creation, its role on the globe, and what that means in a post-colonial, post-African slave trade world. I have to check myself in my thinking because I don't want to approach it with an American perspective. It don't want to posit, \\"if only they were capitalists and democratic\\", because at the end of the day we are all sinners in God's eyes. And I don't think He gives a hoot about our American ideals. So, I have to come at from a creation standpoint--that He loves us, created us, and allows us to live in this broken, fallen, and suffering world where things like Rwandan and Sudanese genocide happen. Just because I sit in the comfort and luxury of my own culture does not excuse my response as a Christian.  Halfway through reading the book I realized that I wanted to teach it, my reasons numerous. It is a modern story, a wonderfully crafted novel, the language is accessible, and the story revolves around abuse, drama, and societal upheaval. In other words, there's enough drama to keep my students' attention. Reading it with my teacher eye (which I will need to do again) changed my perspective.  One could say that from a Westerner's perspective PH explains away the problems of third world countries. That it is just another post-colonial novel. But I think that explanation is too simplistic and misses the mark. There is no superficial judgment present in this book.  There are no easy solutions to the problems presented. Characters are drawn (born into) into a circle from which they cannot escape. It exudes with a feel of heaviness, that there is no hope, making Nogozidis's story powerful and subtle. And it's the subtlety that moved me the most. Nogozidi deftly weaves together the core of the novel: a subjection of society to the tyranny of the chaos resulting from political coup. This same theme is mirrored by Kambili's home life . She and her family are helplessly ruled by their father's intimidation which was a result of colonial Catholicism, just as their government is helplessly tyrannical in the fusing of post-colonialism with national leadership.  From a Westerner's perspective it's so easy to explain away governmental tyranny, to feel that we don't have those problems. But from a Christ-centered perspective I don't have that luxury.    The only possible solution is destruction, or deconstruction, but without an identity either national or self, those options are limited and unavailable.

B0013TPVXS|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is rapidly becoming my very favorite author.  With that being said, the Mistborn series begins with a Sanderson trademark, which is an innovative and unique magic system.  While the first book focuses on this magic system and a budding romance, The Well of Ascension goes a new direction entirely.  This book focuses on character development of every character introduced in the first book, as well as innumerable twists and turns of all types of conflict, from physical, to strategical, to psychological.  If it has a flaw, it is almost too good.<br /><br />Really, this book is quite unpredictable, and quick paced, full of action and suspense, albeit, a lot of it being psychological suspense.  Now, if you want guns blazing action throughout this book, you really find it more of a 'how can we get out of this remarkable predicament with integrity intact' kind of ride, for the majority.  Then the rest is all gun blazing action, well, more like allomantic action, but you get the picture.<br /><br />Sanderson in this book takes the somewhat risky subject (since it is unfamiliar to most people) of city siege, and deals with it deftly, by reducing it to national style politics, and negotiation.  When physical conflict does arise, it is mainly dealt with from individual perspectives, limiting the descriptive detail on strategy.  This is further strengthened plot wise by allowing the attack to occur with mindless brutes as the aggressor, which basically have no strategy.  Now it all seems realistic, without a lot of detail.  Brilliant.<br /><br />Now this book isn't perfect, but it hides its flaws well, namely through distracting you with a wonderful story.  There are some lapses of logic, where things are a little too easy, but they are easy to forgive. Still, since I haven't finished the third book, I strongly suspect some of these so called 'lapses' might reveal themselves to be undeveloped plot.  Who knows?<br /><br />Overall, lovers of fantasy should love this book, especially if they have read the first one.  This book takes a completely different direction from the first book, as far as subject matter goes, but somehow it is equally enjoyable, if not more so.  A rare thing in trilogies, for something like this to be accomplished.<br /><br />A word on romance.  Folks who loved the 'pseudo Jane Austen style' romance in the first novel, might be disappointed, since all the romance in \\"Well\\" is based on the continued development of the main romance started from the first novel, which has lost all of the 'noble' aspects of the setting.  To flesh out the situation more, however, this novel inserts the 'dark stranger' romance, with elements of 'he's too good for me' thrown in for good measure.  Sort of like a vampire novel where the girl must make the choice between the darker character and the good guy.  All that being said, I can see no reason for lovers of the first book not to love this book as much if not more so than the first book.

B00007K02F|2.0|This 1996 movie was the first adaptation of Jane Eyre that I ever watched and when I did so I was appalled by it. So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester. Since then I have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel, the three short versions of '44, '70 and '97 and the three mini series of '73, '83 and 2006, and I have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse Rochesters.            This is without doubt the most exquisite Jane Eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned. Director Franco Zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky, of lonely Rochester standing on a rock, and of Jane looking out of the window - but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life. In addition, his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes. As a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between Jane and Rochester, and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse. There are a number of short conversations between Rochester and Jane, each of them beautifully staged, but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other. We know that they are supposed to fall in love, but we never see it actually happen. The scene in which Rochester wants to find out Jane's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded Mason has left the house is completely missing, and the farewell scene, the most important scene - the climax - of the novel is reduced to four sentences. Zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for Brontë's superb lines, neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten, but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out. What remains is just a glimpse of the novel, which does no justice to Charlotte Brontë's masterpiece.    The cast is a mixed bag: While Fiona Shaw is an excellent Mrs Reed, Anna Paquin's young Jane is more an ill-mannered, pout Lolita than a lonely little girl, longing for love. The ever-reliable Joan Plowright makes a very likable, but far too shrewd Mrs Fairfaix, and one cannot help feeling that Billie Whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain-looking, hard-working Grace Poole. Charlotte Gainsbourgh as the grown-up heroine, however, is physically a perfect choice for playing Jane Eyre. Looking every bit like 18, thin and frail, with irregular, strong features, she comes closest to my inner vision of Jane than any other actress in that role. And during the first 15 minutes of her screen time I was enchanted by her performance. Gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask. But unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of Jane's character any further. As a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues, Gainsbourgh's portrayal of Jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory. This is a pity, as with a better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might have been as good a Jane as Zelah Clarke in the '83 version.    But while it is still obvious that Gainsbourgh is trying to play Jane, there is no trace whatsoever of Rochester in the character that William Hurt portrays. Hurt, who has proven himself to be a fine actor in many good movies, must have been aware that he was physically and type-wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the Rochester of the novel. His Rochester, besides being blond and blue-eyed, is a soft-spoken, well-mannered nobleman, shy and quiet, slightly queer and eccentric, but basically good-naturedand mild. He is so far from being irascible, moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous. Additionally, during many moments of the movie, Hurt's facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness. Particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open. If you compare his Rochester to the strong-willed and charming protagonist of the novel, simply bursting with energy and temperament, it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in Hurt's performance. Still, he offends me less than the Rochesters in the '70, '97 and 2006 versions and I would in general rank this Jane Eyre higher than these three other ones. Hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the Rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so, whereas George C. Scott, Ciaràn Hinds and Toby Stephens thought they could, but failed miserably, and I'd rather watch a character other than Rochester than a Rochester who is badly played. And I'd rather watch a Jane Eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today's couple in a Starbucks café. Of course this Jane Eyre is a failure, but at least it is an inoffensive one, which is more than one can say of the '97 and 2006 adaptations. I would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation: You will not find Jane Eyre, but at least you will find a beautifully made movie.
0425220931|3.0|First, there's this:  [...]    I enjoyed The Music Lesson.  I read it on vacation down in Mexico.  Good content.  Reminded me a little of a book called, [[ASIN:0394400437 Inner Tennis: Playing the Game]], and probably any number of other similar books that apply Zen/Tao philosophy to every day pursuits.  I guess the technique of using Michael (the teacher) and the other characters was useful to keep it kind of interesting.    After that (it was a quick read, and I'm a horribly slow reader) I read, [[ASIN:0061687200 Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog]], which is about a dog in and a family.  I care about dogs a lot less than I care about bass playing (I have a lab--don't need to read about them too).  But, in my opinion, Marley and Me was extraordinarily well written, where The Music Lesson was, from a literature standpoint, written pretty amateurishly. Not surprising, since Marley's author is a professional journalist, and Victor is a professional bass player.    So I'm very happy to give Victor a lot of slack on The Music Lesson.  I'm glad he wrote it, and I'm glad I read it.  It explains how he got to be able to play Norwegian Wood, and it even explains why he smiles when he plays it!

0316017922|4.0|The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.
031606792X|5.0|I picked up Twilight while shopping at Walmart (sorry Amazon).  I had never heard about the book and really only picked it up because the cover caught my eye.  I took it home and read it straight through overnight.  At the time I couldn't see how another book was necessary much less three more.  I have now read the entire series three times through since getting the last two books a little more than a month ago.  I've always been a fan of romance so it has great appeal to me.  I have also been a fan of the Vampire genre.  From the movie Bram Stroker's Dracula to Buffy the Vampire Slayer I have enjoyed vampire lore.  The Twilight series takes everything you thought you knew about Vampires and turned it upside down.  No creepy monsters, no stakes through the heart, no fear of the sun or crucifix.  I really enjoyed Twilight even though it felt like the book of a first time author (much the same as Sorcerer's Stone by JK Rowling).  New Moon was darker and not as light and enjoyable as Twilight but still a good book.  I read Eclipse as soon as it arrived and enjoyed it so much I read it again straight through without going on to Breaking Dawn.  I'm glad that the series didn't take away from the original story.  I worried that four books would dilute the premise and take away from the story of Bella and Edward but it only made the story of their love more involved and interesting.  I highly recommend this book and the entire Twilight series.

The simplicity of the prose is stark yet moving. Several of the stories have a reoccurring theme of losing the matriarch in the family, however each group handles it differently.  It's wonderful to see how two characters of her stories collide later in life but painful to watch the decisions they make unfold.  I love this book, and would recommend it to anyone!

1400063515|1.0|The emperor has no clothes on!    I believe this book could  have been easily condensed to 15-20 pages.     The style of writing reminds me of Geroge Soros - confusing, didactic, and pompous.    It was like eating scramble eggs but with the egg shells included.
B0007KTAU4|4.0|sweet in the best sense, sometimes sexy, and especially good of you like French, but not necessary to enjoy this CD. Only minus is that the range is somewhat narrow.
B001FW2R5I|5.0|This is the band's third album and it is great!  They took a new path with using guitars and also various other instruments.  It is really genius, if you are a Keane fan you will like this album.  I suggest the Deluxe Edition for the full Keane experience.  There are several fabulous videos you can't miss out on on this version.
B0013ND30M|5.0|There is nothing better than a classic Disney movie.  Children of all ages will enjoy this movie
B00005JPFH|5.0|Having seen all 3 Spider-Man movies, I can say, without a doubt, Spider-Man 3 was the best in the series to date. The first spent way too much time setting up the plot for the second, and the second spent way too much time focused on the relationships at hand. That doesn't mean to say the first or second Spider-Man movies were bad, (they were actually great) but the third cashes in on everything. It has something for everyone! For the comic book followers, it sums up the alien costume saga very well. For the movie-lover, it offers the emotional highs and lows that made the first 2 Spider-Man movies great. For the kids, the bad guys in this flick are as great as they are ever going to get. The fight scenes are great..and so are the scenes leading up to them. Here is to hoping Spider-Man 4 is equally amazing. (Or even about as good..in this case..would make it FANTASTIC.)
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I have had mine for a few weeks now and use it every day and have yet to reacharge it so it does hold its charge.  It works well for what it is intended for.  We have a 1 year old and we use it to clean up the crumbs and mess he leaves under his high chair and all around the kitchen and on the carpet as well.  I recommend it for anyone with a baby who is looking for something to quickly pick up food left on the floor.  Our 1 year old loves to push it around as well which makes cleaning even easier!
0743299795|5.0|This book contains all the seeds of the Lean Production Ideas. A must for the serious Lean Practitioner. This is the most influential book on the subject. However it needs a great deal of study and deep understanding but it's worth it for the insight and Lean foundations it provides.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|I felt that the film needs a re-edit. The flow was broken and the logic is not continuous. Could be a lot better. The director seems to be enamored of special effects
1400063515|5.0|Let me start by saying this is a fantastic book, but I did not think that as I was reading it....why? because, the more I read, the more depressed I became, not with the book but with the tearing down of the illusions I have built up over many years about managing businesses and organisations. Realising that all the MBA models for this and that actually feed our futile desire to get control of the future, create certainty and create and illusion that we know what we are doing. These models have created an Illusion of control, far better to deal with reality and be prepared as best we can for big changes which traditional analysis tells us are highly improbable and creates a false sense of security. Taleb has shown that the highly Improbable is anything but.<br /><br />Taleb deconstructs, (rips apart)very logically, the predictive probabilities associated with the ubiquitous bell curve in a manner a non statistician can understand and provides us with a language to use against the analysts, who are using highly sophisticated bell curve models in an effort to make business decisions. This predictive activity can now be revealed for what it is...nothing more than corporate tarot card reading.<br /><br />For me, finding out that the steering wheel I have been holding onto to steer my company is not connected to anything is a revelation, and has forced me to see the world as it really is, not as the analysts would have us believe.<br /><br />Well Done Taleb.
0061537934|5.0|You will never look at your dog in the same way after reading this wonderful novel. If you own a dog, you MUST read this one.
0141031484|5.0|I enjoyed this book and found myself in philosophical agreement with many of its concepts. While this is written by someone who operates in the Stock Market, it is equally applicable to other forms of corporate life.<br /><br />Attributing causes to explain events (even when there are no connections) is a basic human instinct driven by the need to feel in control and not at the mercy of the gods or mere chance.<br /><br />I have seen the same basic instinct demonstrated time after time in the world of management within organisations. What I like about Taleb's book is that he provides me with some good examples I can now quote the next time I see 'fantasy attribution' at play.<br /><br />But the biggest take away for me is the fact that he is cool about not pushing his ideas or getting upset when people are clearly constructing a delusion. I am reminded of an old proverb attributed to the Chinese that illustrates this.... 'Don't try to teach pigs to sing, why not? Two reasons, 1) Pigs cant sing and 2) It annoys the pig.<br /><br />So from now on, just like Taleb, I am not going to get upset, I have stopped teaching pigs to sing.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|It is a very funny movie! My kids have seen it several times and they laugh a lot. Very creative and excellent characters. It is a good choice.
B000GRUMPU|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Poseidon is by no means a great movie (though neither was the original, if it comes to that) but it's fun and quick-moving and showcases some nifty special effects.
B0001932ZA|3.0|PLOT   In a pessimistic future, an innocent man is captured whilst on the run from questionable authorities and forced to participate in a deadly gameshow.    REVIEW   The vision of the future is similar to that conveyed in \\"Robocop\\" (1987). The all-powerful corporations have taken over, and the gap between rich and poor has reached maximum.    While \\"The Running Man\\" is more dated and naff than its hugely successful counterpart, it takes itself less seriously. The violence is far more bearable and there is considerable fun to be had during the tame but exciting action sequences. It's as if the \\"The Running Man\\" wasn't trying as hard as \\"Robocop\\" to show the audience where capitalism is headed, yet it achieves equally convincing social commentary.    Also, \\"The Running Man\\" is one of the better Arnie films. His physical acting abilities are in top form, while some of his greatest one-liners can be found here.    This DVD version contains both newly remastered widescreen and original full screen versions. There are also some interesting and rather humorous documentaries, though they are not directly related to the film. This is NOT a DVD for lovers of extras.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|The Bottom Line:    The movie occasionally gets a little too preachy for its own good, and doesn't plumb the depths of human despair the way that the novel did, but it's a well-acted and well-made movie that mostly deserves the accolades it has earned over the years.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I LOVE this Soundtrack, but I wish they had put Let Me Sign by Rob Pattinson on it, as well. The song is playing during such a strongly moving part of the movie, when Edward is sucking the venom from Bella's arm,that it seems wrong that they left it off the CD. Otherwise, it would have been 5 stars. Loved it!
B00005T30L|2.0|The Bottom Line:    I know tons of people who esteem Ghost World but I found that it came off as pretentious and not terribly interesting--because the film is a polarizing piece of art, I would recommend (if you want to watch the film) renting before buying.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This was baught strictly beacuse of Johnny Depp. It made a great gift itme for a teen girl.
B0008ENHUI|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Papillon runs a bit long at 150 minutes and doesn't bother to characterize McQueen's character enough, but it's a solid piece of entertainment that should appeal to anyone who likes prison flicks or well-made movies in general.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I purchased this for a holiday gift.  I was so happy when it arrived quickly.  Thanks !
B000GFLKF8|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The movie runs a little bit too long, has no real purpose for Jodie Foster, and tries to pass off Christopher Plummer's character as someone who had influence during the Holocaust (assuming he was 35 in 1945, which is still a bit young to be running a bank, that makes him 96 in 2006), but avoids many of the pratfalls of similar heist movies and emerges as a watchable thriller.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Is a great movie, my kids enjoy it a lot, and the games are good too
B00005R24G|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A fine showcase of actors at the top of their games and a clever mystery, Sleuth is a little long but a fantastically enjoyable movie: rent it!
0783231202|2.0|Full of stereotypes, cliches and bad acting. The screenplay is based on a true story.<br /><br /> This movie relies on the viewer having a strong sense of entitlement and thus being aloof of the less than subtle insults aimed at caucasians.  The film notes the African's language had not developed words for abstract concepts such as \\"maybe\\" or \\"if\\".  The script presents this deficit as a form of moral superiority suggesting  t their language does not need the word \\"IF\\".  Because \\"you either do something or you don't\\", the African leader sagely informs us.<br /><br /> Who are the buffoons in this film?  The Christians who devote their time to protest against slavery are depicted as useless and referred to as \\"those miserable people\\" by the very man they are trying to help.<br /><br /> Good music, scenery, and comic relief were not featured in this film.
B0001LYH9S|4.0|Every Bowie fan I know doesn't much care for his nineties work, and the consensus about this album among the more prestigious music critics, like Rolling Stone, seemed to be that Bowie was trying too hard to do something experiemental to win back his rebel cred and for that reason most of the album sounds like good song writing diluted with pretentious instrumentation and funny voices.  I think it was Rolling Stone that said something to the effect the only time he relaxes his desperate need to be weird and presents a song in its simplest detail is Strangers When We Meet.<br />  Maybe I'm just looking at the same phenomena from a different angle, but I love that this album is obvioulsy a huge, brainstormy \\"dude, wouldn't it be cool if\\" tangent.  The literal story being, uh, \\"told\\" may be incomplete, excessive, self-indulgent and relate-able only to a specific niche of science fiction fans, but I'm a member of that niche.<br />  Basically, a man named Leon Blank, who seems to be capable of manipulating the space time continuum and is somehow personally involved (romantically?) with a transhumanist cult leader, is falsely accused of murdering a 14 year old girl, while the real killer, a deranged artist living with a shop owner named Algeria Touchshriek, runs free.  It is also believed this is an \\"art crime\\"- that is, a crime meant to have artistic value, and may be legally evaluated based on its artistic merits rather than its destruction of life and limb.<br />  It's definitely my kind of story, but even if it wasn't, music is the most important thing about music, and this is simply good, experiemental electronica and industrial rock with a few genre-benders thrown in (A Small Plot of Land, I Am With Name, Wishfull Beginnings).  Some songs seem to have thematic consistency, as in you are noticing a raw impression (see the song writing of Syd Barrett or Cedric Bixler-Zivala).  In fact, most of the album is like this, but it works the most on A Small Plot of Land, I AmWith Name, We Prick You, I'm Deranged and The Motel.  Some odd songs have a more noticeable \\"thesis\\" like Thru These Architects' Eyes, Strangers When We Meet, No Control and I Have Not Been to Oxford Town.  Some songs straddle these categories, like The Heart's Filthy Lesson and, Voyeur of Utter Destruction and the title track.<br />  So yeah- buy for the cyberpunk weirdness and catchy electric hooks,  keep for the surprisingly convincing and expressive song writing.  My five favorite picks would be (in no particular order) The Voyeur of Utter Destruction, We Prick You, Strangers When We Meet, I'm Deranged and A Small Plot of Land.  And yes, I don't know if I'm spelling voyeur right, which is pathetic since the track listing was just one screen back, but whatever.<br />  Point being this does not seem like the work of an old guy struggling to remain relevant and is meets the standards of anything that came before it.
B00168HARG|5.0|I'll have to admit that I was not looking forward to this show when it was announced.  The idea of taking James Cameron's classic characters and doing, what I assumed would be, a low budget weekly show sounded like instant entertainment death.  However, this is a well written, well acted show that has added great depth and complexity to both Sarah Connor and her son in a way that there just wasn't time for in the two Cameron films.  Also, Skynet is fleshed out in a way that the films never could, or at least never did.  The more it plays with the timeline, the stranger things get.  At this point no one is even sure which side they're on, not even the terminators.<br />  The Blu-ray image is full 1080p and the sound is crisp and clear.  Since I watched all of these originally on Hulu.com it was quite a step up.  There are some interesting extras including Summer Glau practicing ballet and some fun outtakes.  Basically any time Sarah Connor loses her American accent, that's comedy gold.
B000BYRCH4|1.0|Best example of a real stupid movie with real stupid line, insulting (non) logic, that people adore -- just goes to show the state of mind of the masses.     On several instances this movie insults the intelligence of the audience, if there is any, with nonsense.    The pictures are nice but overall the movie sucks.
B00004THAY|5.0|I purchased this CD for my father's birthday. I purchased it because I enjoyed it so much myself. I love jazz and the blues and so does my dad. When I think that I have found something special, most of the time I buy one for him and this CD is wonderful.
0670020745|5.0|This is a very rare book depicting an amazing inside view of a stroke and a woman's will to live. Jill's ability to share her story with such detail of every moment of going through her stroke and wisdom drew me into each page. She shares her account of what was happening inside her body from a intelligent doctors perspective, while she was experiencing one side of her brain shutting down and operating and living in the other side of her brain. Jills determination to live and heal was remarkable, and she shares very important information for us all to learn from. Her incredible story proves there is a spiritual divine nature within all of us that resides in a space of unconditional love and the unconditional love she received from her mom was so powerfully healing to her. I wish Dr. Jill Taylor much love and joy on her journey. Thank you so much for sharing your story!

It will work every area and you will usually see great results within the first few workouts. This video needs to be added to every workout library!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I love this movie because it's so poignant, but still very British in its humor.  Multiple story lines come together at the end, and it's about true love, so how can you go wrong?
B000J4QWMC|4.0|disclaimer: i'm a real michael mann fan. seems to me this film hasn't been appreciated as much as it deserves to be. i have to wonder if maybe being a take off on the old tv show caused some automatic expectations that didn't get met. apart from the go-fast boats, this is a really different kind of drama than the tv show could hope to be. i find the acting to be very convincing all around, and it has all the superior cinematographic qualities that mann insists on. try to see it without any of the old-show ideas in mind. not in my mind as good as collateral or heat, but still a really fine film.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] (1991) is a wildly creative album that rocks with the best, and has a surprisingly intelligent and compassionate point of view. The obvious influences on these Seattle rockers are Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix and The Who, but this isn't a ripoff of any of those styles. Pearl Jam definitely had it's own sound when the band hit the scene with this stunning debut.<br /><br />Lyrically, the album's themes explore various forms of psychological isolation and personal perspectives on societal issues like homelessness, neglect, abuse, drugs and suicide. Using characters to help put a face on these issues, many of the songs here are empathetic and supportive of the unfortunate, and sometimes deeply flawed, figures.<br /><br />Once chronicles the downward spiral of a man who loses his sanity and eventually becomes a serial killer.<br /><br />Once upon a time<br />I could control myself<br />Once upon a time<br />I could lose myself<br /><br />Even Flow is a great rocking tune with strong guitar riffing and enthusiastic solos. It's about a homeless man who is beginning to lose his mind.<br /><br />Freezing.<br />Rests his head on a pillow<br />Made of concrete... again<br /><br />Every song is a winner here, and rock guitar fans will enjoy what [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] has to offer, too. Guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready play inventive heavy riffs and blistering lead solos everywhere here. Eddie Vedder is a strong lead singer when he wants to be, and there isn't a bad vocal performance anywhere on this album. His emotional reading of Jeremy, a song based on the true story of a 15-year-old boy who commited suicide in his classroom in 1991, is especially haunting.<br /><br />Jeremy spoke in class today<br />Try to forget this...<br />Try to erase this...<br />From the blackboard<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] is a classic that ROCKS! It's one of the best rock music albums of the 1990s and beyond. Even though the subject matter is dark and sometimes hopeless, it's presented in such an unrestrained and powerful way that the album is very much a motivating and energizing listening experience. Definitely recommended to every alternative rock/hard rock music fan out there.<br /><br />\\"...Hey, but I'm still alive.\\"album is very much a motivating and energizing listening experience.

B001GSV3EC|4.0|I ordered this for a Christmas gift, but it arrived a few days late. Cannot really fault the vendor as I was perhaps expecting too much, having placed the order on Dec. 10 in the middle of the holiday buying furore.     Arrived in good order. I would use the seller again.
0671027573|2.0|A romantic suspense novel with a good premise.  Girlfriends come up with a \\"list\\" of the perfect man over drinks after work.  The list gets out and soon becomes a media phenomena leading to the murder of one of the friends.    Jaine is the heroine of the novel and one of the friends who came up with the list.  I found this character very hard to like, in fact, I downright disliked her.  I found her judgemental, obnoxious, and loud.  She struck up arguments with pretty much everyone she came into contact with!  I'm all for a strong, and funny heroine but Jaine took this beyond that into the realm of annoying!  Her character ruined the love story in this book for me.  I couldn't understand why such a great guy like Sam Donovan could fall for her.    I know I'm in the minority and that most people loved this book...but I did not and I can't even pretend that I enjoyed it even a little.  Sorry...that's just my opinion.
B001C08RHA|4.0|The movie had a great pace to it.  It kept you in suspence for what was coming next.  Robert Downy Jr. played the part to perfection.  I can't wait for the sequil.
B0015OKWL2|2.0|Seeing Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together on-screen is the kind of ultra-rare treat that could make any film worth seeing.  That fact alone is the only reason that Righteous Kill is worth seeing in the very least, as both cinematic icons elevate what would be an otherwise dismal cop drama to something that is only instead a disappointing flick that isn't worthy of having Pacino and De Niro in the lead roles.  Both play aging veteran cops who find themselves embroiled in a serial killer case in which there are some big implications, and the twisting screenplay ends up getting to the point of being purely incomprehensible, with a majority of the major story developments not being surprising in the least, and the choppy film editing doesn't help things either.  Directed by Jon Avnet, who directed Pacino in the unbelievably bad 88 Minutes, Righteous Kill just ends up not being worthy of the immense talents of Pacino and De Niro, and sadly, both of whom just seem to be on autopilot here.  Other actors from John Leguizamo, Donnie Wahlberg, Carla Gugino, Brian Dennehy, and Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson, are just wasted here in supporting roles.  Still, seeing Pacino and De Niro on screen together for the first time since Heat is something special indeed, and makes the film worth seeing on its own.  If you're expecting another Heat however, or anything remotely close, you've definitely come to the wrong place.
B001PE26QQ|5.0|If you think \\"Flash Point\\" or \\"Dragon Tiger Gate\\" was good then \\"Ip Man\\" surpasses all of them with it martial arts choreography with raid punches and solid story line structure much like to \\"Once Upon a Time in China pt.1\\"  Donnie Yen gets better and better with all of his fighting skills as Bruce Lee's shifu, \\"Yip Man\\".  I believe this film is a good launch for 2009 martial arts epic picture.  5 out of 5 stars.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|I love this show with all its suspense, gore, great story lines, and excellent actors!  When I got each season, I sat and watched each one within two days - I couldn't stop!  Even my husband who can't sit still for more than a little while watched with me - and that says something big!  It's sick and twisted and fun to root for the bad/good guy who is totally relatable in his quest for justice, no matter how it comes about and no matter what he has to do to get it.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|CGI has allowed great film makers like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg to totally throw away story and film-making. It's quite sad to see our older top directors and actors for that part continuing on in disgrace. Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull was one of the most disappointing movies I had ever seen. As soon as the computer chipmunk popped up in the beginning I knew the cgi tinkering would be outlandish and unbelievable. The only thing enjoyable about the movie is it's poster and dvd artwork which relates to the previous Indy films.     Marian was a total waste of a character in this film. She was poorly brought back and treated as a tag along. Shia LaBeouf swinging on vines with computer aided cartoon monkeys completely destroyed all hopes for this movie living up to any possible par of the original Indy films. The ending was a bit long and not much fun to take in. It would have been nice to see a better representation of ancient technology and artifacts which suggested \\"alien\\" lifeforms were around in ancient day, but even from a true historical and archaeological sense the directors and writers failed.    I think Spielberg and Lucas have become greedy and that is the only reason we now have to live with Indiana Jones 4. It is very sad to see our film makers fall from the once great visions they brought us in the past.
B0000931QR|5.0|This is my favorite of all the LODVG albums (with Amaia Montero) - The music really came together in this album. The lyrics are beautiful, especially in Rosas, La Paz de tus Ojos, and Un Mundo Mejor. I bought this album  soon after its release and it is still one of my favorites.

055358894X|5.0|This debut novel was exactly what I hoped for when trying a new author:  skill at storytelling, unexpected twists, and characters and settings that did not feel cliche'd.<br /><br />The richness with which the author details not only the main characters in his story but the world in which they interact is truly impressive.  Obviously a great deal of thought went into the details of life in Camorra, not just for our hero, but for all walks of life.<br /><br />A fun read from start to finish, Lynch has created a world which readers will eagerly wait to re-enter in future books.<br /><br />This twisty adventure yarn gets my highest recommendation.

If you liked \\"Very Bad Things\\" you will probably like this as well.  It's not quite as extreme as VBT, but it goes along the same Murphy's Law type of plot.  Very enjoyable.
032147404X|4.0|I've been away from \\"real\\" photography for many years, and rather than dust off and upgrade all my old 35mm equipment, I decided to jump in with both feet and go full digital SLR.  Unfortunately I came to realize I had forgotten almost all I once knew (or thought I knew) about SLR photography.  This as it turns out is an excellent way to get back in, or if you are new to this, a way to get started.  Once you get past his rather odd sense of humor, Scott Kelby does an excellent job of making everything about digital SLR photography very plain and understandable.  I love his use of \\"shoot by example\\" with his simple examples and explanations.  Rather than lengthy dissertations about how a camera or lense is made, he simply tells and shows you how to make good pictures happen.  Using this book as a building block I have been able to get a toe hold on my SLR photography and will now be able to build upon his teachings and begin rebuilding my photographic skills.  Because I read this book before making any purchases, I was actually able to make several decisions on what equipment I bought based on information I picked up within the pages.  I have already loaned the book to another neophyte, and have requests from another because of the excellent way in which Scott teaches.  I highly recommend this book to anyone at the beginning stages of digital photography.
B000093FLA|5.0|Who wouldn't like this one?  And didn't youse guys already make me review this once?  It's great...certainly not for small children.  I really liked this when I got it.  I am so bored with Brad Pitt right now, though, maybe you want to wait to see it until he and his \\"wife\\" aren't pasted on every publication between you and the check-out every single day.
072325804X|5.0|Our daughter loves illustrated children's books and grew up on Peter Rabbit.  When she had her 1st child this fall, we were trying to decide what to get for his 1st Christmas.  We decided on this book.  We were not disappointed.  When our daughter opened it on Christmas for her baby, her comment was, \\"it is the perfect gift.\\"  We all enjoyed sitting and looking through the book with its beautiful illustrations and timeless stories.  It is an incredible collection of Beatrix Potter's body of work for children.  The stories are classics and it was a gift that our grandson will have for years to come and can pass on to his children and his children's children.  I highly recommend this book for any new parent.  Grandparents can't go wrong--it is a keepsake that will last for a long time.
0956010903|4.0|I gave one of these to my daughter the lawyer for Christmas and the other to my step-daugher-in-law.  I know that my daughter went nuts for it and is very pleased.  I think, however, she is planning on buying the paperback edition so she can keep this one in its virginal state.  My step-daughter-in-law seems pleased as well.  I have not read it myself, so I cannot give it the full five stars.
B00003CXAA|4.0|Fast shipment and well kept DVDs. However the box has sticky parts I am not able to fix: this disappointed me.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|I am not a horror film fan.  Would never watch most of them.    But, I have always liked this film.  Still do.  Holds up over the test of time, except for SOME of the effects.  Some are still very good but some look cheap now a days.    Cast does a good job with their roles.  Still, however, do NOT like the parents smoking drugs with their 3 kids in the house.    I am VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE DVD.  Where are the extras?  No interviews with the remaining cast, no deleted scenes, story on film or effects , etc.  Just a lame thing on poltergeists.  Will NOT even waste my time watching that.    This is supposed to be an anniversary release for the film.  THEY APPARENTLY DID A RUSH JOB & DID NOT CARE TO GIVE FANS ANYTHING EXCEPT THE FILM TO LOOK AT.  AGAIN, AS I SAID ABOVE, THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING.    This makes me rate the DVD a 4 not a 5.
0740748475|5.0|As a kid, I loved Calvin and Hobbes.  I even emulated Calvin to some extent (much to the dismay of my parents and babysitters).  I bought this set for my girlfriend, who also adores the strip.  After I bought it for her, I did a little research on the strip and its author.  I never really thought about many of the special things about Calvin and Hobbes; I just liked it because it was funny.  But reading through some of the strips now, it's amazing how great the art is, and how wonderful the lessons are (even though Calvin may not have learned them).  I wholeheartedly recommend this collection to anyone who remembers trying to play Calvinball; anyone who's had a friend like Hobbes, who brings out the best in us; and anyone who wants to experience at what a truly gifted artist and writer can convey in just a few square inches a day.  It's really too bad Mr. Watterson's finished with comics, but his legacy is a must-own.
0525951113|5.0|I read this last year when Suarez was publishing it himself. I was totally blown away by the plausible plot and tight suspense. Where Clancey writes what he's researched, Suarez writes what he knows and lives. If a digital doomsday is looming, it could very well happen just this way. Gamers, programmers and anyone else who likes a taut read that centers on our electronic world will enjoy this book.
069111966X|5.0|I had had this book for some time and never read it except for a glance or two. A few days ago I sat down after a successful stint at a  pure maths problem and applied myself fully to this book. Wonderful! I was particularly taken by the claim in the introduction, by Sutherland, that Polya is concerned with helping show how to think. Just as a golf coach shows you how to hold the club, the tool of the game, as well as being concerned with getting the ball into the hole, the solution, so Polya shows one how to exactly adjust one's mental grip on the golf club of mathematical and general problem solving. This is a key part that most textbooks on maths omit.    An example of the kind of thing that is very useful in this book is the following short quote from Polya: \\"Even fairly good students, when they have obtained the solution of their problem and written down neatly the argument, shut their books and look for something else. Doing so, they miss an important and instructive phase of the work. By looking back at the completed solution, by reconsidering and reexamining the result and the path that led to it, they could consolidate their knowledge and develop their ability to solve problems.... There remains always something to do; with sufficient study and penetration we could improve any solution, and, in any case, we can always improve our understanding of the solution.\\"    Highly recommended. If you are serious about either learning maths or solving problems of any kind, this book is worth buying (and reading.)
0743454537|3.0|This was certainly worth reading; however, I don't think it was her best.  It had gotten a lot of attention so I read it because I liked her other books so much.  It is a very complex issue and even through the end I wasn't sure what I thought was best and I think that is a feat of Picoult's to be able to write a novel without swaying the reader too much one way or another.  However, I just thought that it was a little slow and it didn't keep my interest as much as the others.  I certainly wanted to read it all the way through, but I even while I was reading it I was thinking ahead to other books.
B001DHXT20|4.0|I cannot tell you how pleased I was with this movie.  Not that it was particularly brilliant in and of itself, but it was a massive improvement over its jaw-droppingly horrible predecessor, \\"Hulk\\".  With its perfunctory script, poor action sequences, and blatant overuse of splitscreen effects, that movie disappointed me beyond belief.  But, leave it to Edward Norton and Zak Penn to redeem the series, and bring the big green guy to the big screen like it should be.<br /><br />Here we see Bruce Banner struggling with his newfound affliction, and attempting to contain his little rage problem.  After striking up an online friendship with a mysterious scientist (who I won't identify here, but we'll see him again), Banner may have found a way to cure himself for good.  But, when a new hulk-like creature (The Abomination) shows up and begins wreaking havoc, Banner must rethink this decision.<br /><br />Overall, this is pretty much just everything you need in a superhero movie. It lacks the depth of something like \\"The Dark Knight\\", for example, but it's well-written and tons of fun.  The action sequences are so much better than they were in \\"Hulk\\", which I found to be really choppy and disorienting.  Here, the effects are magnificent and the fight sequences are crisp and exciting.  The Hulk still looks a little too Jolly Green Giant-ish in my opinion, but it's forgivable this time around.  The Abomination looks really cool though.  A lot like Doomsday from the Superman comics, but I wouldn't call it a ripoff because one I'm not sure which character was created first, and two they were always pretty similar anyway.<br /><br />All in all, this is just a really well-accomplished flick, and Edward Norton is perfect as always, proving once again that there's no genre he can't handle.  You also get fun cameos, like Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee (of course), original Bruce Banner Bill Bixby appearing on a TV screen, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu master Rickson Gracie, and another Marvel hero who shall here remain nameless.<br /><br />Definitely check this out.  It will not let you down.ss.      Definitely check this out.  It will not let you down.
0061150142|5.0|This was an excellent book. It was the first I had read of Picoult's and I have read many more of her's simply because of it. It constantly keeps you guessing, even when you think you've figured out what really happened. The characters are very well developed, as with all her books, and you really fall in love with all of them. This is my favorite of hers thus far.
031606792X|1.0|Okay, I have to admit that I was taken by the first three books in the way that any person flipping through channels gets over-taken by the poorly written soap opera when they are bored.    I couldn't help but to roll my eyes as SM told us the story of Bella. The self-centered, whinny girl who somehow catches the attention of a vampire named Edward. It was a badly written romance attempt from the beginning. The only thing it ever had going for it was the cliff hanger chapters. I kept reading, thinking, \\"There's more to this, right?\\"     The first three books weren't unbearable. Bella for some reason seemed to attract attention constantly. From Edward and Jacob fighting over her to vampires trying to kill her, everyone was out for Bella. She is the center of the universe. Then, her vamp-bf is so romantic and so hot that we have to be reminded of this fact over and over.    The last book was terrible. Stephenie Meyer was just making it as she went along. \\"Why bother?\\" She must have thought. \\"I already got them hooked.\\" She puffed up this fantasy guy (Edward) and her version of herself (Bella) and didn't want to leave fairy land, so she just threw together a totally unbelievable ending.     Vampire-human baby? Really? If your heart stopped and you don't have to sleep or breathe, then how...? And, of course, Stephenie Meyer had to reconcile the fact that Bella wanted to become a vampire, but didn't want Rosalie to hate her, so what does she do? Bella didn't have a choice, of course! She would have died otherwise during the birth.    I think these books were written by Stephenie Meyer for Stephenie Meyer. Let's get Stephenie Meyer and her fantasies a room!!!

0525951113|5.0|Years ago, I remember thinking about Multi User Dungeons (MUDs) and how much they affected people in the real world. I knew people who were obsessed with MUDs, the first Multi-User Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs). I was obsessed. (I think the first time I ever appeared in Wired was in 1993 when Howard Rheingold with Kevin Kelly wrote about MUDs and mentioned my obsession.) In MUDs, people got married, people got divorced, people lost their jobs, people shared ideas... The MUDs I played touched the real world through all of the people in the game.    Unlike the World of Warcraft and more like Second Life, MUDs allowed players to create rooms, monsters and objects. When you entered a MUD, it was like entering the collective intelligence of all of the people who played the game. There were quests that were designed by people using their knowledge of Real Life(tm). Playing in their worlds was like walking through their brains. These worlds merged and collided as people from everywhere collaborated in creating MUDs of various themes with various objectives.    At some point in the evolution of MMORPGs, MUDs forked and we ended up with most of the people who liked creating objects and worlds in places like Second Life where, while you CAN make games, most of what happens is world creation. The \\"gamers\\" ended up in games like World of Warcraft where the game play aspect has been honed to a fine art, but the player content creation aspect has been completely lost. (Although most of the developers are former obsessive players.)    What I envisioned back when I was playing and hacking MUDs more was that if you turned the world a bit inside out and imagined that YOU were the MUD, the people who played your game were like little pawns or interfaces for you in the real world. They inputted content and created worlds and taught you about the real world. They promoted you to their friends. They played obsessively increasing experience points and commitment to the game so thatthey would forever feed you and keep you alive. They would set up servers and pay for hosting just to feed their obsession and protect their investment. If you became extremely popular, a group of your players would spawn a new MUD with your DNA-code and there would be another one of you.    The hardcore players would hack your open source code and keep you evolving. The Wizards would educate and add character to each instance of your code. The players would be your footprint in Real Life(tm).    When most of the gamers moved to corporation owned closed source games designed by a team of developers, I stopped having this dream. The games were no longer \\"alive\\" in the same way I had envisioned them evolving.    After reading DAEMON, this dream is back. Leinad Zeraus depicts a world where a collosall computer daemon designed by a genius MMO designer begins to take over the world after his death. In many ways, the vision is similar to the vision I had, but the author adds a macabre twist and many many more orders of scale to make this one of the most inspiring books I've read in a long time. The author is \\"an independent systems consultant to Fortune 100 companies. He has designed enterprise software for the defense, finance and entertainment industries.\\" He uses his experience to make the book extremely believable and realistic and still mind-blowing.    It was super fun to read and is a book I'd recommend to any who loves the Net and gaming. I'd also recommend it to anyone who doesn't. It's a great book to learn about the importance of understanding all of this - before it's too late.
031606792X|5.0|i loved this book. i am half and half on the team edward/team jacob. i was very happy with the way it ended. i wont give anything away but jacob is still in the picture. thank god. i was like if he isnt in the end of the book i would be ticked but for all of you jacob fans, he is still there. and for all you edward fans,,,,,,,,he is still there too. lol. i love breaking dawn. i am thirteen years old and i love the twilight series. i dont see how other people dont like this 4th installment but i just love it. i hope the people who read this review love it just as much as i love this book.
0061703087|2.0|Sorely disappointing. I want to say that I like Crichton, but this was just a joke. The idea is fascinating, but it's executed in an insanely predictable way. I think that Crichton is just re-writing the same novel over and OVER again: Protagonist is trapped in a secure facility. Means to safety is outside that facility in an unprotected building. WATCH OUT. Oh, it's all okay. Whew.<br /><br />I'm glad that's finished. Spare yourself.

0307269752|4.0|Something old and something new.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO takes an old mystery plot, the 'closed room' whodunit, and gives it a new and interesting twist.  The villainy at issue is the disappearance, 40 years earlier, of 16 year old Harriet.  Gone without a trace from an island that, due to an accident on the only way on and off, points the finger at someone in the family.  And the family is, as we learn bit by bit, so dysfunctional as to give any practicing psychiatrist either the case study of a lifetime or grounds to get out of the business altogether before going bonkers himself.<br /><br />Recently disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired by Henrik Vanger, patriarch of the Vanger family, one of the most successful business families in Sweden, to find out what happened those 40 years ago.  Mikael discovers a crack in the evidence, so small as to have been overlooked all this time, and pries it open bit by painstaking bit.  We learn, ever so slowly and ever so deliciously, just what happened to Harriet.  Poor girl.<br /><br />Blomkvist gets help from the dragon tattooed girl herself, Lisbeth Salander.  A girl with extreme emotional issues and the most anti-social personality one is likely to encounter in a character not explicitly a villain, she possesses an uncanny ability to dig up the dirt on other people, especially that dirt best left underground.  The characterization of Salander is author Stieg Larson's high point.  The character of Salander, as she exists within fiction, is cold, aloof and emotionally two-dimensional.  Her character could easily have come off as lacking depth as well.  Yet Larson portrays a two-dimensional person as a three-dimensional character, getting inside Salander's emotional life in such a way that we experience her emotional aloofness, flat if we were to actually meet her in real life, as full through the portrayal.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, if Larson can bring Salander's inner life to light through the written word, other characters are well fleshed out and alive, too.  This skill helps Larson well when we meet the freak show of the Vanger clan.<br /><br />THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, though, is not without weak points.  Salander, as we learn, possesses a skill (I am being vague so as not to give spoilers) that exists only in two places:  urban myth and works of fiction.  This gives Salander a bit of an artificial feel, particularly acute given how well she is otherwise drawn.<br /><br />Further at issue is Larson's use of the book for social commentary.  The original title in Swedish was MEN WHO HATE WOMEN.  Sure, some men do.  And we do meet some slimy ones here.  But whenever someone wears such an agenda on his sleeve, we have learned from experience that they may be loose with the facts and looser still with the interpretation.  That appears to be the case here.<br /><br />Prior to each section, we are treated to an epigraph about violence against women in Sweden.  Such statistics are notorious for being unreliable.  I have never seen a popular study on sexual harassment that did not include 'suggestive looking' as a factor.  And many studies on violence against women include things like a man yelling at his wife.  Not surprisingly, the numbers are high.  Also not surprisingly, the numbers even up when the women are asked if they ever yelled at their husbands!<br /><br />Larson seems to be equally sloppy.  One epigraph tells us that 18% of women have been threatened with violence by a man.  Yet another tells us that 42% have been the subject of violence by a man!  Yes, there are 'sucker punches' that come out of the blue, without a shred of forewarning.  But a 24% differential between those threatened and those who are subject to violence!  And that assumes every woman so threatened actually saw the threat come to fruition.  I have seen enough of such numbers as to find them extremely questionable.<br /><br />This wouldn't be so bad if Larson merely kept this in theepigraphs.  Yet he infuses the book with the same sloppy thinking in support of this ideological agenda.  Thankfully, it is never overwhelming enough to overshadow the story.  It also is not enough to prevent me from reading the follow ups to this book, which I eagerly await.hinking in support of this ideological agenda.

B001GKJ2DO|4.0|OK - its not great art, but neither was the stage play. Mamma Mia makes you feel good and the DVD does not disappoint! Its also great to get an extra dose of Meryl Streep singing in some of the extras. She's kept her wonderful singing voice from the movie audience largely hidden but actually was in a lot of complicated singing roles on stage early in her career.     Balance this out with the painful process of listening to Pierce Brosnan sing (makes the case for dubbing) and the last star is lost.    I've played the disk over and over. I completely recommend a buy!
B001ED7C58|5.0|i loved this CD! i am soooo happy that they put artists like linkin park, mutemath, muse, and paramore on it. some of these songs were in the movie. but not all of them. i loved all of the songs. i thought they fit with the movie. alot of my friends didnt think it fit with the movie but i thought it did.

0316017922|3.0|First of all, I enjoyed reading this book. It was entertaining and made you think \\"huh\\" at various times. The whole point of this book is that success does not happen in a vacuum and there was always something else going on at the same time that helped the person along. The marketing of this book says that he \\"shatters the myth of the self-made man\\" or something like that. For many reasons, which I will detail at the end, he does not prove this or shatter a myth or anything. He just has some case studies and anecdotes.     This book is basically a series of stories about successful people and some interesting evidence about success. Most of his chapters have interesting stories and some evidence, but he doesn't prove anything at all considering how many questions he leaves at the end of most of them. The first chapter, about how age differences make big differences in sports was shown conclusively and makes a lot of sense. All of the other chapters are not nearly as conclusive. Other reviewers went into more detail about the lack of conclusiveness in any of the chapters.     A few of the readers complained that this book was not researched well and was not that good as a result. That is what I was expressing before. I feel that the book is good if you take it for what it is and consider the background of the author. The reviewers who complained about this book compared the book to other more detailed social science books. Most social science books are written by academics. They have to take the book they write and defend every point they make or else they can be denied tenure or something else for bad research.     Malcolm Gladwell is coming from a much different position. He is a writer whose main responsibility is to sell books so that his publisher is happy. Unlike academics who worry about the validity of their conclusions, Gladwell has to worry about his appeal. He has to appeal to the widest audience, therefore he makes it more entertaining and doesn't go intoextensive detail. Besides, if he did go into extensive detail, the book would be very large.     That being said, the book is very arrogant about its accomplishments. His conclusions are based on case studies and anecdotes. Case studies do NOT prove or even conclude anything about a broader range of people. There are many shortcoming and holes left in all the chapters. That is fine on their own considering the source, but he rarely recognizes his shortcomings and presents his evidence in a more unmitigated fashion that it should be presented.     Lastly, his problem-solution part of the book was terrible. The last two pages of the book before the epilogue shift from the anecdotal evidence to speaking about it all as a problem and proposing a solution. He starts detailing that the fact that these lucky shots gave people advantages is somehow not \\"right.\\" He then proposes that we should fix the holes that allow a few people to succeed if they get that opportunity. He does not propose how this should be done and does not go into what he feels the cause of the inequity could be. He was very arrogant in this part and its purpose is to just save face if anything.     In conclusion, this is just like his other books. Entertaining, interesting, and you do learn something and then think about it in your daily life. However, this book does not have long-term longevity and is little more than a fad due to the flaws of it as research. I doubt that it will be remembered in 20 years and I doubt the Gladwell will be offered a faculty position at an elite university as a result of this \\"research\\" if you want to call it that.

0767811070|5.0|Boyz In The Hood is embraced by most people for all the wrong reasons. Most people embrace for the portrayal of hood life but only a few people understand why Boyz N The Hood is one of the most important contributions to Black cinema. Boyz N The Hood had a social conscious that is missing from a lot of hood flicks that come out nowadays.<br /><br />The story if you didnt know is about Tre'(Cuba Gooding Jr) being sent to live with his father after he gets in trouble in school. The rest of the film details his experience in South Central Los Angeles.<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne is at his best here. I always thought that he was a great actor and his role here proves it. Furious Styles is a loving father but stern and wise enough to be observant about his surroundings. Cuba Gooding Jr is great as Tre': a somewhat confused but intelligent kid. Ice Cube's best performance next to Fudge in Higher Learning will always be \\"Doughboy\\". Angela Bassett shines as Tre's caring mother.<br /><br />I like all the gems in this movie like Furious telling Tre' why Black men shouldnt join the army or Furious explaining to the neighborhood in Compton what Gentrification is(hell, most people dont even know what that is now). The stereotypes in this movie are all too real: The mother that loves one son over the other, the biased black cop, the confused black men and women and crack cocaine. All these things still exist that is why Boyz In The Hood is still relevant after all these years! I recommend this movie to the crowd that is smart enough to embrace it for the gems that are held within. Two thumbs up all the way.

1582701709|1.0|1. Bogus metaphysics, bogus science:    The Secret pretends it's a book about winners and how they win. It isn't. That's just the come-on. It's actually a happy make-believe feelgood book for losers.    Positive thinking is a powerful force, but it isn't magic. It's more like a necessary precondition to success: people who believe they can succeed are far more likely to succeed than people who are sure they'll fail.     For instance, say they're starting a new business, and they run into some big problem. The person who thinks in terms of success will say \\"Gosh, I'm going to have to figure out a way to get around this problem if I'm going to be successful.\\" Then they get to work on figuring it out. The person who thinks in terms of failure will say, \\"I knew it was only a matter of time before the universe screwed me over -- I can never catch a break,\\" and gives up trying.     Very important point: in both cases, positive or negative thinking didn't affect the universe. What it did was affect the way the people made decisions and addressed their problems in the real world.    That's the difference between a genuinely useful and valuable book like Norman Vincent Peale's The Power of Positive Thinking, and the pile of steaming tripe that is The Secret. Peale's book tells you that positive thinking is the best starting point for getting what you want. The Secret says that positive thinking is enough all by itself. It dresses its idea up in bogus pseudo-scientific language, but essentially what it's saying is that positive thinking is magic.    That's premium-grade hogwash. Positive thinking isn't magic. Thoughts are not magnets. There is no Law of Attraction, no primal universal force that makes the events in our lives match the way we think about our lives. Positive thinking is a good mindset for making good decisions about the actions we take, but it's the actions that have the effect, not the thoughts.     That's why The Secret is a feelgood book for losers.    ===2. Some real-world implications:    If Rhonda Byrne's advice were any good, neither she nor her publisher would have to publicize her book. They'd just think the right thoughts, and readers everywhere would automatically be moved to pick up a copy.    People cycling through the manic phase of manic-depressive bipolar disorder would be such a nexus of inventiveness, serendipitous insight, and luck, that major corporations would bid on their services.    No baseball game could ever end as long as the fans on both sides believed victory was possible.    We'd never run out of petroleum.    Average global income would be far more evenly distributed than it is. After all, anyone can hope. Anyone anywhere can think good thoughts.     Alternately, there could be Third World sweatshops available to do our believing for us.    Finally, if Rhonda Byrne's advice were any good, the Evil Overlord list wouldn't include the observation that an Evil Overlord who shouts \\"I AM INVINCIBLE!\\" is a sure bet to die almost immediately afterward.    ===    3. Fraudulent provenance:    If thinking the right thoughts really could do what The Secret claims, that fact could never stay a secret. Everyone has people they love; and because they love them, they want them to be happy and successful. If they learned an infallible secret for attaining power, wealth, and success, they'd pass it on to those they loved so that they could be happy too. Those people would tell others, and so the knowledge would spread. Soon it wouldn't be a secret any more. After that, people would start preaching it from the rooftops, and carving it into the sides of buildings.     Let's limit it to children. Can you imagine withholding such a secret from your own children? Could you keep silent while you watched them lead frustrated and impoverished lives, or died from conditions you knew how to cure? That's not believable.    Now, genealogists will tell you as a rule of thumb that everyone with European ancestry is descended from Charlemagne, who lived from 742 to 814 AD. That is: if Charlemagne knew this secret knowledge, and he only told his children about it, and they only told their children, and so forth and so on, by now half the world would know it. Yet author Rhonda Byrne says the Greek Philosophers and the Ancient Egyptians had this knowledge. The Greek Philosophers lived about 1,100 years earlier than Charlemagne, and the Ancient Egyptians lived more than three thousand years earlier. It's ridiculous to imagine that a simple, basic, easy-to-apply, and yet overwhelmingly powerful universal principle could stay a secret for even a fraction of that time.    ===    4. Further real-world implications:    If what Rhonda Byrne says in The Secret were true, Las Vegas wouldn't exist. People don't place bets they think are going to lose. Gamblers are powerfully into positive thinking. Someone who's betting heavily while drawing to an inside straight is unquestionably visualizing success, and they're telling the universe exactly what form they want it to take. They nevertheless fail to fill their straights at exactly the rate predicted by plain old statistical probability -- that is, most of the time.     Positive thinking is all around us. New restaurants, new breakfast cereals, new television shows, and new political candidacies expect success. No one throws their heart into studying ballet from age six onward because they envision themselves having the wrong adult body type and winding up teaching tap and jazz to children in some dull but affluent suburb. The world is full of unemployed theatre majors, unpublished writers, unsuccessful beauty pageant contestants, unheard-of musical acts, and college athletes who never make the big time. None of them got there by thinking they wouldn't succeed.    If Rhonda Byrne's advice were any good, no singer would ever hit a wrong note. That goes double for singers who are drunk.    I know other reviewers have already covered the implications of The Secret's suggestion that misfortunes are caused by our own negative thoughts. Still, I have to say: NO KIDDING? SOMEBODY PHONE DARFUR NOW!    And while we're waiting for that phone connection: no kidding? Insanely bad high-level decisionmaking, failures of oversight, and a grossly irresponsible pursuit of deregulation for its own sake had nothing to do with our lives getting zapped by a collapsing economy? Look at Enron's employees and stockholders. They didn't expect to get screwed. New Orleans residents who didn't have cars never envisioned themselves drowning in their own attics. Homeowners with subprime mortgages never imagined they'd wind up in foreclosure.     Are we to understand that some families have an inexplicable tendency to attract the same ailment, generation after generation? How is it possible for devout Christian Scientists to die of cancer or eclampsia or ketoacidosis? If a guy in his late 50s has been in denial about his radiating chest pains for the last ten or twelve hours, and the first thing he says when the EMTs come through his door is \\"I'm not having a heart attack,\\" has his attitude improved or decreased his chances of surviving the episode?    If I worry about drunk drivers, and then some night I get t-boned at 60 mph by an irresponsible lush with a DUI record as long as my arm, is the accident actually my fault because I had all those negative worries? If I've got a cheerful toddler with me, who's responsible for her death? If I kneecap Rhonda Byrne, and set fire to the warehouse where her books are waiting to ship, will she apologize to me for thinking thoughts that obliged me to do it?    ===    5. In conclusion:    I swear, I've never had any thoughts that warranted the existence of this book.
0575081406|4.0|I read this book when it first came out.  I was highly impressed and I still think about it even now.  It def made an impression on me. The thing I loved about it was the way it's written.  The descriptions are so beautiful and the atmosphere is soaking wet.  The part I liked most I think was Kvothe talking about when he was young and with his mother and father.<br />The only complaint I have really is that it kind of unraveled towards the end.  The girl Kvothe likes...I just didn't get it.  I didn't think she was a very good character and I didn't understand why he liked her so much.  And the very end was...disappointing.<br />Hopefully, with this promising debut, we can expect that the sequel will make up for some of the lack that the first book had.  I will most assuredly read the sequel!

With this offering, Oldfield blends technology and melody in a way that removes the listener from the world around them and flies them to the far reaches of the galaxy -- an impressive contribution to the world of music.
B00133KFGW|4.0|OK--this is a feel good movie and it was clean enough that I could watch it with my kids without having to fastforward which is always a bonus.     And I wanted to love the storyline. I just couldn't get myself to do it. It was like a really good cinematographer who decided to let his girlfriend write the script not because she could write, but because he truly loved her.     Others have pointed out all of the \\"miracles\\" that keep happening to make this movie have a happy ending. With just a tweak here and there it would have been better. The evil Dad could have been shown paying off the Irish musician to leave the daughter alone. And why has a perfectly normal kid been left without any kind of at least a foster home from infancy or did I miss that part? Just a few changes--storyline would have been better.     However, the idea that music is in the world all around us was just brilliantly portrayed. I also loved all of the music that was performed and so that more than made up for the nonsense.     A great movie--just leave your ideas of reality at the door before watching it.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|Sure, The Matrix is not very realistic, but it's sci-fi. I thought this was going to be a more believable, regular action movie. But regular action movies don't feature assassins using centrifical force to make bullets curve out of guns, or make the bullets turn corners and go around things like a miniature guided missle. Not to mention being able to aim exactly where to land their cars after flipping them through the air. And what kind of assassin training prepares them to survive inside a high-speed train car that plummets thousands of feet down a canyon? Just a little overkill on the incredible here. If this were a movie version of Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, then it would be OK! Oh yeah, you get shot? No problem, just submerge yourself into some high-tech mix of water and concrete, and presto! You're healed within minutes!    This just didn't feel like a real sci-fi type movie, so to me it's just a highly unrealistic action movie.    And were the screenwriters trying to set some kind of record as to how many times they could squeeze the f-word into their script? Even the nerdy fat-lady boss spews the f-word seemingly more times per minute than Eddie Murphy in Raw! A lame, cop-out attempt to spice up the script that just doesn't work. A real turn-off...I don't mind much hearing it if it's just here and there, but regular, dignified-looking people in an office setting rattling it off every three seconds is a bit overkill.    I guess this is based on some comic series, but the characters in this movie just don't have much pizzaz or personality--they're just regular hoods, and McAvoy's character is just some geek who turns into some Rambo type within six weeks. The plainness of these characters don't lend themselves to a story with such crazily unrealistic action. It's not a boring movie, it goes fast with plenty of action, but not much charm to it, sorry.    THUMBS DOWN!

0312360266|2.0|I read through this book pretty fast because I enjoy books about learning new powers and attending a new and different school, but I felt it was all very rushed. The first part of the book was forgettable, the characters were annoying, and I couldn't wait until they moved on from that. I don't really feel the beginning was necessary at all except to set up the ex-boyfriend.  After that the story picked up a bit, with the mark, new school, bully, new friends.  Life really isn't that hard for the main character in this book, she may be different with her full mark, but she made 5 friends within the first few minutes of being at a new school. The bully wasn't that bad really, there were no fights, no punches thrown, just words.  I've dealt with worse.  The main character has powers that the leader of the school doesn't even have, she has tons of friends, and the hottest guy in school likes her. I don't feel sorry for her one bit.  Add to that the fact that the entire vamp school part of the book only takes 2-3 days, and I get more annoyed.  The mother daughter team in this is a bit evident also.  It's ok to not like beer and drugs, but to say poop and poopie instead of cursing is unrealistic, and turned me off even more.  I will continue to read the series, though I have an idea as to where the next books may be going.

B000RZIGSG|5.0|OK. I'm an 80's kind of guy. I admit it.    But those who cheapshot this movie miss the point -- i.e., it's fiction... but with a more-than-valid message for today.    IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, WHO WILL?    This is \\"Rocky\\" for girls. (But, let me tell you, the message isn't lost on us guys either.) Yeah, it's got its crude and rude moments... but isn't that a more-than-appropriate description of the very world in which we dwell? By 2009 standards, it's so very very tame. Sad, really.    But mixed with the banal of this movie is real beauty. (Not to mention Jennifer Beals herself. Is she really almost 50?) The beauty of lives facing fear and failure head-on. And triumphing over it. Exaggerated movie fantasy? Perhaps. But who really sets the boundaries for our lives other than ourselves? I would argue that there are many real-life examples of success that could trump those portrayed in the film.    Bottom Line: \\"If you give up your dream, you die.\\"    Rather than listen to all of today's naysayers, I would just watch this movie again. And again. And again.

B001JNND9W|3.0|Though I'm now in my fifties I'm afraid I'll never grow up: I still like \\"Vanishing Point\\", done so ever since I saw it first in the early seventies. I've seen in on tv, had it on tape, still have it on laserdisc and on standard DVD, still have the LP soundtrack and now, finally I have it on Bluray (it was released over here in Holland early January, 2009.    The image is only slightly better than the standard DVD, simply because the original filmgrain is the limiting factor as far a picture resolution is concerned. My copy was incorrectly labelled 2.35, it is in fact 1.80, like it was shown in cinemas. I was very pleased to see that the sound had been redone in 5.1 DTS HD, but this turned out to be a big disappointment. This is not a remix: all dialogue and music are still in mono and front-centered, only very occasional there is some surround sound effect, but definitely the sound does not live up to 5.1 DTS HD expectations.     Well whatever! If a true 5.1 version comes along, I'll be buying that too, probably. And there are some nice extra's on the BluRay disc.

1595141715|5.0|Eleven times on the NY Times bestsellers list about sums it up.  Had to get three of them for friends.  This book is one everyone should read to help all be kind to others and think before your actions towards others.  This book is not for just students, but parents should read to open discussions with their kids.  Teachers should read to be aware more of their students, not just their schoolwork.  I have read reviews from all ages and the vast majority of them are totally positive about this book; as to how it opens eyes and promotes discussion regarding the subject matter.  A truly remarkable book.  Thank you Mr Asher for writing it!

031606792X|5.0|I was very surprised by the negative reviews given to \\"Breaking Dawn\\". People have talked about the writing, the sex, the \\"eewww\\" quality\\", and the lack of battles.  As a 40-is mother of two, I agree with several reviewers that they audience that has not appreciated this book are more likely to be younger and expecting that individuals 'remain the same' even as they mature, marry and have children. I agree that Bella has had little time to mature however having had so many high-risk incidents, difficult decisions and character-changing decisions -- I think the outcomes are quite logical. The other factor is that Bella was always described as an 'old soul' and spending time with individuals that are at least 80 years old -- tends to provide a more mature outlook.  1) In terms of the writing, I never felt the writing in any of the books was 'literary prose' and I suspect Stephanie Meyers feels similarily. She wrote about characters that she is passionate about. It isn't JK Rowling and shouldn't be considered as such. That doesn't mean that it isn't 'chair-gripping'. I myself read all 4 books in one week -- amazing for me.  2) I find the sex issues to be ridiculous. Of course, sex would be important to them considering their overwhelming desire for each other. It only makes sense that this is very important -- to be honest, it is very important for most people when they are honeymooning etc. Also, having to 'be careful' and discuss it so much -- they would have built an expectation that they would have been afraid about as well. This is fiction not a 'teen sex guide'.  I would have been very disappointed if Ms. Meyers wrote with the purpose of providing a 'role model'. For Edward, he had waited for a long time. For Bella - she had as well -- in a modern sense.  I also think readers are not aware that with the love and family that they had -- they lived culturally more like an extended family in other countries. I know that in Asian cultures where there is a large family under one roof --- a parent would feel very comfortable to have others with their child. If you have had a baby -- you know that the feeling of 'motherhood' is not instantaneous. And fatherhood tends to be even longer. My husband was a little frightened that he didn't feel 'like a father' immediately. It came -- it just takes a bit. This was actually very realistic considering the risks to her baby and the total trust of whom she was with (the Cullens).  3) the \\"ewww\\" factor: I also thought this was ludicrous. Have any of these reviewers ever seen a live human birth??? Lots of 'eeewww\\" however when you love someone -- you accept it. I was horrified to learn later about how 'gross' it may have seemed to my husband as they wiped away bodily fluids etc --- but he didn't see it that way. Edward as a vampire was closer to the human element in some ways. Hunting as they did -- they were used to the feeling of biting a live animal etc. I thought this was very sensible and was relieved she didn't candy-coat this. Birth is wet,bloody and gross. It is also beautiful.  4) The lack of a final battle: This made more sense to me than to many of the reviewers. I am a loyal Harry Potter fan -- but that battle was necessary for a variety of reasons. These vampires are CENTURIES-OLD creatures --- similar to Anne Rice's logic ---- it would take a lot for them to actually battle one another considering the fewer number of their species. She explained this in a way -- by comparing them to the young shape-shifters of Jacob and Sam's packs. They would have fought but that is because they are merely 'children'. When you have lived hundreds of years -- you will think a lot before dying for a cause. It reminds me of some species where the battle is more about who is bluffing and who backs away. Very logical.  I loved how Bella was a vampire. It was clear that all of the vampires were beautiful, strong and graceful. Why shouldn't Bella be as well?  For all the mysogynistic criticism --- shewas strongest in this book. She was physically stronger than Emmett, protected those she loved and even jumped at Jacob. I loved that scene. People are crazy to think that all of the events of the past 3 books wouldn't have made her stronger, more confident and better able to cope.  I agree that people think literary expertise means that 'someone dies' --- that is foolish. Things were lost here. She may never get to really see her mother easily. Though she can see Charlie -- there are things she can never explain. Although she trusts Jacob -- this isn't the person she would have liked him to imprint on.  Edward's personality matched perfectly in this book with the others. When the most important person is near death -- he can't be sarcastic and witty. Of course he asks Jacob to have her child etc. He's more mature than many of these reviewers. It's no longer about petty jealousy -- he's desperate to have her live at any cost. It made sense if you see him as being 100 not 17.    I hope Stephanie Meyers reads these interviews. I am sure that if she had 'killed off' people just to make it interesting --- she would have gotten as many complaints.    I understand this matured Bella very well. It is a path, albeit a different one, but similar that many of us have taken as we reach our places of comfort and confidence.

031606792X|2.0|I was one of the ones who absolutely fell in love with this series. But, with that being said, I was a little disappointed in the 4th book. It was wonderfully written, but the passion that seemed to radiate between Bella and Edward in the first 3 books fell a little flat here. I didn't feel they were as connected as before. I like Jacob, but too much of the book was spent on him. I would have rather seen more time with Bella and Edward.    I would love for Stephanie Meyer to finish Midnight Sun (the story from Edwards point of view) which is posted on her website. That would totally vault this story over the top.
B000F39MAQ|5.0|I struggled with whether to review this because it is so phenomenal that words seem to fail to do justice to the experience.  Willy Decker (the director of the production) is a blatant genius, and his Traviata is unparalleled in its ability to reinvent and make relevant an opera like Traviata, which is clearly a musical masterpiece but can be presented rather dryly.  Here it's seeping with sexuality, emotional honesty, and brutal hardship.  The details must be seen and heard to be believed (for instance, the way in which the Prelude to Act 3 is staged), but I do believe Decker has actually improved upon this already cherished opera.  Watching this left me wondering what he could do with other Verdi pieces.  Netrebko, Villazon, and Hampson are uniformly superb, as is the entirely committed ensemble.  Netrebko's limber physicality and abandon is something even Catherine Malfitano would sell her soul to the devil to achieve.  Netrebko is a stunning vocalist but more importantly, she suggests a new standard for opera performance that I have never seen before but hope to see much more of in the future.  Villazon is her equal in every respect, and probably the best acting from a tenor I have ever seen.  But the staging, both in its subtleties and its daring, is the true star of this production.  I have been watching operas for most of my life, and never have I been so affected by a director's vision as I was watching this work of shocking originality and depth.  Please do not hesitate to order this immediately.  I plan to watch this many, many times as long as I am on this earth!  I pray Decker directs as many Verdi pieces as possible, applying this same vision!

0525476881|4.0|Former child prodigy Colin believes he's all washed up -- and has a string of ended relationships with girls named Katherine to prove it (nineteen, to be exact). With his exceedingly high IQ and love of anagrams, teenage Colin has spent his young life pushed to read more, learn more and be more by his well-meaning parents, but after the latest relatioship with Katherine XIX ended with her unceremoniously dumping him, Colin knows he needs to try for more than just academic success. Plus, he's having no luck discovering his \\"Eureka!\\" moment.<br /><br />After his best friend finds him sulking face-down on the carpet, Colin and Hassan set out on a road trip: Colin to clear his head; Hassan to put some ideas into it. Hass has spent the last few years on his parents' couch watching \\"Judge Judy,\\" opting out of a college education or job in favor of potato chips and not-doing. A trip to nowhere in particular may be just what they need -- especially one without any Katherines in sight.<br /><br />\\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" was my first experience with John Green, and I'm sure it won't be my last.

While the math problems began to make my brain hurt about halfway in -- I'm a lover of words, not equations -- I was still interested to see how, and if, Colin could come up with his great idea. The appendix in the back of the book helped make sense of these problems.<br /><br />I loved the relationship between Hassan and Colin, and though I didn't completely understand Colin as a person, I could certainly relate to feeling as though your childhood was filled with such promise -- and your adolescence feels strangely, painfully, ordinary. Lindsey Lee was also a really fun character and I cringed a bit over her relationship with TOC, but all's well that ends well.<br /><br />Full of quotable quotes and other anecdotes, I definitely recommend this one to lovers of literature -- not just young adult.

B000VWE5OY|2.0|Wow!  Now that I have completed the first season I have to say that I am widly disappointed.  I held out hope that the season would improve, but there were no signs of it by the end.    While the cinematography and general sci-fi feel are OK, the characters (other than Caption Jack) are absolutely miserable.  I kept hoping that they would all be killed by the end, but alas I knew I would be disappointed since they are in Season Two.  Even Captian Jack was only a shade of his brilliance in Doctor Who.    I can't believe that Russell T. Davies could be associated with this.  My opinion of his writing has just taken a heavy hit.  I will certainly not be buying Season Two nor watching it for free if I can watch The Doctor in a re-run.

B001KMB6YG|4.0|I rarely go into Vin Diesel movies with high expectations.  Let's face it, when you build a certain physique and persona you have to accept a little pigeon hole-ing as an actor.  I read other reviews before watching this movie and removed it from my pre-order list and went for a rental.  What a surprise to the upside.  Some of the critique for this movie IS warranted and the ending, as you find it in the US edition, will leave questions.  The most important attitude with which to see this movie is to enjoy the process and not look for simple gratification in the ending.  As a movie set in the near future, this film tackles the challenge of envisioning new technology that is, if not realistic, still far from the utterly ridiculous.  Many movies try to present those ideas and fail miserably.<br /><br />***This is not just another dumbed down action spectacle***.  One might be surprised to see it is actually a very ambitious, intelligent movie for this genre.  Though any one part of the plot by itself may not be original, I found the sum total of it's parts refreshingly different. There are also spectacular visuals, very well orchestrated action scenes, thought provoking issues or conflicts and very wonderful performances by many actors, including Vin!  Pay attention to the technologies and gadgets here and there.  A little satire on religion and the questions of real faith and spirituality were also thought provoking and a little underhandedly funny.  This is a really good movie that just couldn't do everything it wanted in the time allowed.  Don't get me wrong, if I were rating the editing of this movie, it would be two stars.  I have no doubt that it was butchered by idiots who had no faith in an original vision.  I wish they would take the footage and re-edit the US version.<br /><br />***Update:  Amazon UK has a slightly longer version that fills in a few holes.  Know that you like the movie before you spend the cash.  However, they will deliver to US addresses relatively cheap.  You may need a region two player or simply change the region on your laptop.

B000AGTPUU|5.0|I bought this movie even though I had seen it before because it will be a seasonal classic that every family will enjoy for years to come.  When this movie came out my young grandson was so taken by it because it was at the time he began to question Santa that he thought the train would come for him and was so upset when it didn't.  The animation technique done on this movie is spectacular and enjoyable to view.  The story line is well done and the acting wonderful.  I highly recommend it for any age as an addition to your home movie library.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I received this video from Santa in my Christmas stocking. My 15-year-old daughter turned up her nose at it, but she would walk in and out of the room while I was watching it, and has sinced claimed the movie for herself. She has watched it no less than four times completely (including the deleted scenes). I take Thornton over Darcy anyday!
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Not much to say except this is a wonderful movie for any person. Young, old, male, female, I think anybody could enjoy watching Wall-E. Plus, watching this Blu-ray movie on a large HDTV really shows an amazing amount of detail that was put into making Wall-E. I was in awe!
0060855924|5.0|With well over 200 review of this book, there certainly is not much left to say; as the good, the bad and the ugly have already been pretty well hashed out, as has the plot. I am a rather new reader of Pratchett so I certainly am in no position to comment as to if this is his best work or not. I will say though, that if this is not as good as his future works, then I am in for a pure reading treat down the road as I work myself through future books, as I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Anyway, I am certainly not going to beat the plot to death in this review. There are many fine reviews found here that do that already.<br /><br />This, so I am told, is the first of the Disc World Series. Disc World is quite an unlikely place, yet if viewed through the eyes of the author, it is all around us. I suppose there are some basic requirements for reading and enjoying Pratchett. It would seem that you must possess a rather quirky outlook on life, have a vivid imagination and must scramble those two traits with a rather caustic sense of humor. I also feel that these books cannot be fully appreciated if the reader dose not have the ability to laugh at his or her self. After all, if you want to be very honest about it, most of the characters we meet have large portions of our own personalities and defects in them. I personally found, when I was dead honest with myself, a lot of shared characteristic with Twoflower, and indeed, even Luggage. I really don't feel these books are for everyone, but for those that like this sort of thing, it simply does not get any better. I do feel you have to have a large reading data or knowledge base to fully enjoy these books as the author does almost constantly make reference, in very sneaky ways at times, to other works of literature and fiction. If you do not know what he is poking fun at, you loose something in the humor department.<br /><br />The writing style of this author and his imagination are beyond question as to quality and quantity. This is a very readable book and Pratchett is a naturally story teller.<br /><br />Now I have to admit to having cheated a bit and have read a couple of the books from later in the Disc World Series. This book does set things up nicely for those books, in particular in introducing characters such as Death. There are concepts that the author throws around that I will not even pretend to understand, but that is part of the magic and delight of these books. This offering is no different!<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful read and I cannot wait for more.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksreadable book and Pratchett is a naturally story teller.

B001KVZ6BG|5.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is a terrific film.  It is a film of great drama set against the backdrop of modern India where an uneducated boy from the slums rises to challenge for stardom on \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\\".  Yet it is more than just this.  It is also a film of escape from horror and poverty.  In many ways, it touches the core of the human spirit.<br /><br />Do not for one minute think that this film is typical Bollywood.  It is gripping drama with not a song in reach.  We see the lives of three slum children: Jamal, Salim and Latika.  They are forced to struggle as orphans when their parents are killed in religious unrest.  They are sold into beggary and prostitution but manage to escape to greater or lesser degrees.  They drift apart until a final reckoning when Jamal receives national fame for challenging on the Millionaire programme.<br /><br />The story is told in flashbacks.  Jamal is being forced to explain his television success.  As his story unfolds, we also come to understand how he arrived at television success.  The simple fact was that each question had an answer that he had learned somewhere along the road of life.  The show's producers are not convinced but India is entranced.  Jamal is a folk hero.  But before the reader concludes that the game show is the heart of the plot, I must stress that it is not.  Rather, the true story is one of escape from dreadful poverty.  The settings of the film are thus often pathetic.  However, the power of the story always shines.<br /><br />This film is well worth seeing.  Hollywood has produced nothing better during 2008.  I can only hope that the Oscars provide it with rewards.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|\\"Vicky Christina Barcelona\\" is a wonderful, eclectic and typically Woody Allen film.  In some respects, it could be seen as a chic flick but it is more.  There is a rambling story told against the beauty of Barcelona.  It is also the story of American innocents abroad.<br /><br />In brief, the film has four attractive stars in Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem.  Indeed, there is a m&eacute;nage a quarte and it is how the characters interact that is the core of the film.  Bardem is the modern Lothario, Johansson the footloose lover, Hall the conservative modern woman and Cruz the crazy Latin woman.  There is little in the way of plot.  Instead, the viewer is entranced by the characters themselves.<br /><br />The film is full of amusing situations.  The dialogue is quintessentially Woody Allen.  As such it is a film of words rather than action.  However, the film is set against the backdrop of beautiful Barcelona in summer.  Indeed, as with so many of Woody Allen's films, we almost get an architecture lesson as an added surprise.  Usually, it's New York; this time, Barcelona.<br /><br />It is hard to say which of the four main actors actually stars in the film.  It is very much that each actor has his or her own role to play and they are all equals.  Bardem is so different from his previous film with the Coen brothers, while of the women, Cruz is certainly the most volatile.  Yet Johansson and Hall are also excellent.<br /><br />One cannot leave this film without feeling that they are better for the experience.
045122499X|1.0|POTE is one of my favorite books, as others have said...a masterpiece. It hooked me from the first paragraph until the last. How excited I was when I discovered a sequel was being written. How disappointed I am as I write this review and have decided to not even finish the book. I really find it hard to believe the same author wrote both books. I'm not going to rehash everything said in the other negative reviews but simply say, I totally agree. I think what finally did me in was a passage when two of the major characters, who are grown medieval woman, are talking about a sexual encounter and the description read like teenage girls whispering in the hallways of school. I cared absolutely nothing about any of the characters, in fact really didn't like any of them. Could care less about the story which had some of the same plot devices from POTE just with different circumstances and characters and lacking depth and emotion.    I know Mr. Follett is an excellent writer and I just couldn't figure out what happened with WWE. My personal opinion is that he wrote POTE out of a passion he had for cathedrals. He had spent years researching this book and took years to write. I believe WWE was a book he was forced to write...if he even wrote it....to follow-up the success of POTE. Their was no passion behind this writing, only dollar signs.    If you want to read a historically accurate account of medieval life, check out Sharon Kay Penman's \\"Sunne in Splendour\\". A modern masterpiece that will haunt you for days after you finish.
0312383320|4.0|With the ecoonomy going into the tank, and IRAs acting like the incredible shrinking man, it helps to escape for a while into the world of Plum.  I did not like the novel quite as well as last year's Plum Lucky, but it is hard to match the horse and the streaker that one found in that novel.  Still, it is some light entertainment (the author should never be accused of writing great literature).<br /><br />The monkey is back, starting early in the novel, and Diesel is back.  Morelli and Ranger make their usual cameo appearances as Stephi and Lula account for most of the action.  Stephi, as usual, is working for her cousin Vinnie's bail bond company, and is out looking for people who skipped their court dates.  In particular, she is looking for one individual who seems very hard to find, and who is associated with someone who is highly dangerous.<br /><br />The case takes Stephi and Lula into the New Jersey Pine Barrens, so you get a look at that part of New Jersey.  As usual with Stephi, you can expect things like blown up buildings.  And then, of course, there is the monkey.  The language is somewhat earthy, as one might expect.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|From the 1st time i played Kill Bill i was blown away by the sharpness of the Picture of the Blu-ray Version. This is what all catalog transfers should aspire to look like.  If you want a good demo disc then Kill Bill 1 or 2 will do the trick nicely.  THe picture is as sharp as a sowrd and the sound is just as sharp.  If you have the DVD versions then you will not be let down, the picture upgrade is worth the money.        The special features are nothing special thou.  They seem like they are the same ones from the DVD versions.  Some people are upset that it is still 2 separate movies instead of one movie and there are rumors of a Japanese version that will include both on one disc in a special re cut version.  But for now that version does not exist and if you want to see this awesome movie in all its HD glory then this is what your choice is.  And i assure you it is a awesome sight.  The picture quality here is what makes this title worth the investment.  It is well worth the upgrade.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I'd put off watching this for a long time due, in part, to the bad reviews on Amazon (combined with some painful memories of Star Wars being destroyed by the new films). After watching it yesterday (xmas day with my mum :), I can honestly say that I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would do.    I'm surprised by so many negative comments; what were people expecting? This is great, the way Star Wars should have been: good old swashbuckling, heroic adventure with plenty of slapstick humour in between. SPOILER: One part sees Indiana pulled into the back of a moving car from a motorbike, and he fights his way through and then emerges on the other side to climb onto the bike again. Classic! Just like it used to be. This is a great, action and family film which reminded me of my youth. Sure, it does get a little CGI heavy in the closing scenes, but it's all well executed and doesn't detract from the rest of the film which is highly entertaining. I enjoyed this at least as much as either of the sequels and thought the lad Shia Labeouf (who I wasn't at all looking forward to and fully expected to derail my memories like Ja Ja binks did) was great as Mutt and added as much mayhem and humour to the Jones family tree as Connery did, in my opinion.    For me, the film succeeds where Star Wars failed and that is simply in keeping the spirit of adventure and humour of the original trilogy intact. It doesn't take itself seriously and moves along nicely. All the old touches are there (the map scenes as they're flying, the music, and, of course, the heroic action). It isn't quite as good a film as Raiders but is easily as entertaining as anything else in the last few years. My mum and I (both big fans of the originals), thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and my faith has been fully restored. I just wish they'd pretend Star Wars I-III never happened and try again using this formula!
0765356139|4.0|Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn is a knockout, a totally new magic system that is fascinating. Strong characters and an exciting ending. In book two, like most of the second books in a trilogy, is mostly filler and expansion of multiple sub plots. Interesting but slow. He spends a lot of time with characters thinking about the same things they just said. But having said that, I still must get the final book to see if all the sub plots end satisfactorily. Reminiscent of Robert Jordan, Sanderson does a great job of telling a multi-layed story and still keeps you interested. Looking forward to book 3. Buy this you will find it worth while.

B0015OKWL2|4.0|My initial viewing of \\"Righteous Kill\\" left me wanting something more then the standard cop-with-a-twist-formula-flix.  After two more viewings on DVD, I just can't say enough nice things about it!  First off:  DeNiro and Pacino...what more do you really need?  These two could sit around and read the yellow pages and it'd be entertaining.  But, because they are DeNiro and Pacino the expectation level is pretty high...at least it was for me and I would assume many others.  The acting and subtle nuance between these two really makes this film quite good and it works.  Although, \\"Heat\\", was a much finer film, \\"Righteous Kill\\" is a much more satisfying one, in that we get over two hours of these two great actors playing off each other and it is quite enjoyable.  Also cast is one of my favorite character actors, Brian Dennehey, who delivers a solid performance.  Also look for the sexy Carla Gugino in another fine role as the CSI agent who begins to stumble onto the killers path.  I give this film a definate thumbs up and encourage all to give it a look.  \\"Righteous Kill\\"  is a righteous movie!   I rate this DVD release at four stars because great film and very nice extras.  Go see it!  Hey I'm talkin to you!
015206396X|5.0|It is true that there is sexual content, but it does not describe it. It is the sort of writing for young adults. If you did not read carefully, you might even miss the \\"sex scenes\\". It basically leads you to think that they are going to have sex, but then skips over the whole scene.    This is the type of book for young adults to read. Kistin Cashore is not treating her audience like fourth graders, which is what many authors that write for young adults do. I know what many young adults talk about, and I know that many of their discussions invole sex. So, it is not a new thing to them, and many nowadays teenagers are even having sex.     Also, the characters in this book are having sex without getting married. But, the reason for this is because Katsa, the main character, vowed never to marry. Therefore she does not want to break her private vow to herself. And, she does not want to marry and tie herself to a man in that way. Katsa does not want to be responsible for taking care of a man and baring his childen.     If you have an issue with the fact that they are having sex before marriage, then don't read the book. I respect the fact that there are people who strongly disagree with this concept. But, remember tis is not real! And if you do not want your child to think that sex before marriage is ok after reading this book, remind them that it is not real. Also, keep in mind that Katsa and Poe never will marry.    Graceling is pewrfectly safe for young adults to read and also a really great book.

B00005OCMR|5.0|The incredible influence the movie had on the use of computer graphics can never be understated; and through the \\"game\\" that drives the action is a thought-provoking exploration of the human soul in the age of an amazing technological revolution that seemingly makes the individual nothing more than a museum piece.<br /><br />David Warner (Ed Dilliger, Sark, voice of Master Control Program) does an excellent job in personifying evil. And the battle between good and  of evil is brilliantly illuminated by Jeff Bridges (Kevin Flynn, Clu), Bruce Boxleitner (Alan Bradley, Tron) and Cindy Morgan (Dr. Lora Baines, Lori).<br /><br />The wealth of bonus material includes a look into the designing, storyboarding, digital imaging and marketing - which was extensive - of the film, along with a look at the deleted scenes.<br /><br />Rarely can a film be definitively pointed out as one which truly helped revolutionize the entertainment industry. This is one of these very rare cases.

1593083343|5.0|After reading 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and loving it I decided to read all of Jane Austen's works. 'EMMA' was second on the list, if I am being honest, because I loved the movie 'CLUELESS' and although I believe 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' will always be my favorite Jane Austen novel, so far (I am only three novels in) 'EMMA' is a close second.<br /><br />I found 'EMMA' to be extremely witty, intricately woven and definitely kept me on my toes!  The way Austen set the stage for the many different interconnecting aspects of this book just proves why so many readers adore her.  If you are interested in reading Austen , I am sure many would say that you cannot go wrong with any of her novels, however this reader highly recommends both `EMMA' and `PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and hope that you will enjoy them as much as I have.

1439102813|5.0|Reading the novel \\"Still Alice\\" gives one the most realistic and comprehensive glimpse into the spiraling journey a person diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease travels through. Author Lisa Genova takes the reader through every step of an Alzheimer patient's experience with the disease, from the earliest suspicions that something isn't quite right through the final sad stages of this disease that robs a person of their very being.      Protagonist Alice Howland, a Harvard professor, never expected her life would take such a drastic turn toward dementia at the early age of 50. She'd been healthy, fit and a very active academic person. Yet she begins to gradually notice that her life somehow isn't feeling quite the same - she suspects that something isn't quite right with her. Suddenly, remembering the most simple of everyday things she'd always taken for granted as just being a part of her life are confusing her. She begins to fear that she might have a brain tumor. Alzheimer's simply hadn't passed her mind as being a possibility; she was only 50!     Every reader will commiserate with her as the occasional and gradual memory lapses begin to frighten her. She finds herself realizing that she is confused and blanking out, at times not even knowing how to return home after venturing into her normal jogging route. Yet she is afraid to admit to her family for fear that if she acknowledges the problem, it will then become all the more real. Keeping it a secret feels like it might go away. However, it doesn't go away. It worsens. Finally Alice seems a doctor and is forced to attend return visits with a family member as she can no longer be trusted to commute anywhere by herself. During cognitive moments this information frightens her even more as she learns that life as she knew it is ending.     Not only does the reader take the frightful journey of this dreadful disease as this intensely vivid and honest novel reveals, but we can also experience all the thought processing that comes along with it, making us realize that although this story is a sad one which doesn't have a happy or even optimistic ending, we must know and understand what this all entails as it can happen to any one of us.     In the novel, Alice Howland experienced a genetic form of Alzheimer's, something she didn't know would be even possible due to not having enough information regarding her own parents' health history. Yet this is why she was diagnosed with the disease at such an early age. Due to this, she also realizes that her children need to know and understand what is happening to her and get tested themselves, something available in present day which hadn't been when she'd been their ages. While she still can, Alice desperately wants to prevent this disease from taking away the lives of her children, helping them to avoid the deterioration she finds herself having to face.      The Howland family's entire lives change completely as Alice grows more and more \\"empty\\" as she calls her feelings during this time. I found this book to be extremely sad and even scary, however, it's also something everyone should read and understand. Genova expertly describes, with an honest sensitivity, what an Alzheimer's person, and their family members, think, feel, fear and experience along the way of this disease's terrifying journey.
B000008HZB|5.0|This album is one of his best and always will be.    Every single track is unique in it's own right yet it still maintains a flow when listening to it all the way through to the last track.    Hard to describe,but I still listen to this album regularly.  Practice \\"Save Me Now\\" on my guitar. Deceptive in it's finger work and  vocal points when trying play and sing.    I need to find my own voice when practicing, Jeff Lynne found his voice a while back and makes it look easy. Great stuff.

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|What a movie?  If Eastwood does not get an Oscar for this, it will be a desecration.  His acting is so effortless; it reminds me of Spencer Tracy.  A curmudgeonly old bigot who tells it like it is makes a statement that you can be civil, a good citizen without caring about political correctness. This is an evenly paced movie where you are held in suspense, awe with just enough comic relief that keeps the movie warm.  That's the best adjective I can use.  Eastwood is befriended more than he befriends both in the movie, and the movie toward the audience.  I do not want to belabor the story, but two of the principal characters are not human.  His dog and his car.   And one of his chief antagonists can't even speak English.  Eastwood has directed a masterpiece, and if you want to know what movie to see next week, `Gran Torino' should be at the top of your list.  By the way, don't leave without listening to the last song, co-written by Eastwood's older son and yields a conciliatory message in a film where father and sons are not too close.. I suspect that the son too will also be nominated.
B000002GJ7|5.0|I was going through all of my old CDs to rip the best music into my digital catalog. When I came across Extreme's Pronograffitti I was reminded what a great Hard Rock disk it was. Of the 13 total tracks on the disk, 9 are pure Hard Rock...not Pop Rock or Hair Metal like their first disk and subsequent disks...but real Hard Rock.<br /><br />There are 3 rock ballads, the most famous of which is their big hit \\"More Than Words\\". But, man, I'd have loved to see the look on the thousands of confused faces who bought this disk for \\"More Than Words\\", but popped in the disk only to be introduced to \\"Decadence Dance.\\" Decadence Dance starts out tame enough with a kind-of piano melody over the soft background sound of an approaching thunderstorm. Indeed. Thunderstorm approachith! Suddenly Nuno Bettoncourt's guitar cuts in, lightening strikes and Decadence Dance gives listeners an opening song that really represents what (most of) the rest the disk has instore.<br /><br />This disk rocks. Nuno Bettoncourt rivals some of Eddie Van Halen's best work. Gary Cherone sings his heart out. And Paul Geary and Pat Badger keep your feet stomping and fists pumping.<br /><br />This disk is why singer Gary Cherone got a shot with Van Halen (aside from the fact that he was a brother in law to someone in Van Halen's management...or something like that).<br /><br />If you like Hard Rock, you must give this a listen! Add it to your cart.

0525951113|4.0|That is a pretty bold claim... a mix between the Da Vinci Code and The  Matrix. While \\"Daemon\\" has elements of both - the crazy science fiction alternative universe of \\"The Matirx\\" with the insane plot speed of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". While the stories of the three are not similar the outcome is.<br /><br />  In his first novel, Suarrez's Daemon brings together the world of computer gaming, government intrigue, and artificial intelligence (known as AI to the computer literate) and molds them into a fast paced thriller. The story is well researched, and just plausible enough to make you really think that this really could happen (another element of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\").<br /><br />  While reading I thought that this must have been the same experience as a contemporary reader of Jules Verne. A novel that pitted man vs machine using seemingly impossible technologies. Both Verne and Suarez also display more than a small amount of cynicism about the motives of government. I could draw a few more parallels, but I do not want to ruin anything for the readers of \\"Daemon\\".<br /><br />Things that I liked<br /><br />- Ultra-fast paced action - if you skip a paragraph you may miss a ton of action<br />- No one is safe from the Daemon - there are plenty of plot twists!<br />- The amount of research that took place in writing this novel.<br />- There are also similarities between \\"Daemon\\" and the movie \\"Eagle Eye\\" - however \\"Daemon\\" is much, much better.<br /><br />Areas for Improvement<br /><br />- Too much unnecessary vulgarity- to the point where I would be uncomfortable recommending this to anyone under 17. This is the main reason why I rated \\"Daemon\\" 4 stars instead of 5.<br />- The ending is a bit \\"deus ex machina\\"and only serves the point of setting up a sequel. In fact, the last chapter is essentially a prologue to the next installment (not that I mind - I am certainly going to read any follow-up!)<br />- The story does not rely too much on character development, which is a good thing since this is not Suarez's strong point.<br /><br />  I will give a word of warning - Daniel Suarez does not attempt to overly explain the technologies that he uses. \\"Daemon\\" assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge of networks and how they are structured.

B000YRY8BG|5.0|This is a five star+ mini-series, exquisitely written, with a superb plot and cast.  If only there were more programs of such high caliber!<br /><br />Perhaps the last time a movie captured the excitement and intrigue of investigative journalism was \\"All the President's Men\\".  What sets this mini-series apart is the seamless blend of politics, corporate greed, police detective work and dogged investigative journalism. It is a must-see for anyone considering a career in journalism--the untiring curiosity and unceasing questions that must be asked to uncover the truth.<br /><br />As the threads of the plot unravel, evidence of other motives and sub-plots emerge.  So finely are the layers woven together, that the viewer is glued to the screen waiting for more.  Read the other multiple reviews for specifics of the story.  But, do watch this outstanding piece of British drama.
0385340567|5.0|The book was described perfectly, the price was right, and I got it fast. Can't ask for more than that.
1433502437|4.0|I purchased the ESV Study Bible in the Premium Calfskin Leather edition. When the Bible arrived, the content was exactly as advertised.  The one column format, center placement of cross references, and the study notes make using this edition very easy.  The notes themselves, while copious, are evangelical, conservative, and balanced.  The maps are clear, colorful, and actually useful.  It's easily the most helpful study Bible I own.    However, the first copy that arrived had miscut pages where some of the gilded corners had been shaved off.  I was told by the mail order company that I would have to contact Crossway directly to exchange the Bible.    I contacted Crossway and they agreed to exchange it (I had to wait several weeks because of low supply).  However, the next copy had a big crease on the front cover. I exchanged it again, but the replacement copy had double-printed (shadowed) text in several sections.  I exchanged it again, and while the double-printing occurs in about 10 pages in the concordance, the Scripture itself is readable, so I'll be keeping this one.    In summary, a great study Bible (5 stars), but suboptimal quality control at the printer (3 stars).  Having said that, the folks at Crossway couldn't have been nicer--they also have a lifetime guarantee on the Bible, so if the binding ever fails, they will replace it as long as you are the original owner. (So I'll add a star back for a 4 stars rating)    My recommendation is to buy the Bible, but purchase it locally so you can carefully examine it for sample defects before taking it home.
0743298020|4.0|This is an intrigung writing.  I read it before a warm glowing fireplace on a cold wintery night.  A suspensefull story.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Can there be a better combination than an HDTV set, a Blu-Ray PIXAR movie and a BluRay player? The story may be a bit hokey but the visuals are worth watching.  Wall-E reminded us a bit of \\"Number Five\\" (younger folks will have no idea what that refers to) with much of the same personality.  Fun for all ages.
0143038419|1.0|I am having an extraordinarily difficult time embracing this book.  Although I can identify with some of the emtions of the author as I, too, have recently been through a messy divorce and custody battle with many emotional ups and downs.  My problem with this book, is the incessant whining by the author and the fact that normal people do not have the means to take off for a year and spend 4 months in Italy, 4 months in India and 4 months in Indonesia.  I have finished the Italy part and the first few installments of India, but I have had to put this book down indefinitely.
B000E33W1W|5.0|I don't know how many times I've seen Ghostbusters.  And the laughter was just as strong with each viewing.  This is a movie you WILL want in your collection.  It's good for multiple viewings
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Since I'm from the south and I have to say my all time favorite movie is \\"Gone with the Wind\\", my most favorite second movie of all times is \\"Mamma Mia\\".  So what if there are some minute flaws, this is a very uplifting, fun, hilarious, and easy to watch movie!!  The locals almost steel the show...a must see.
0930289234|5.0|Well I will be watching them when the movie comes out soon.  I needed to read this GREAT NOVEL, yes it is a novel, before the movie comes out.  I kicked myself (which is not an easy thing to do) for waiting so long to read this and I regret waiting so long but am HAPPY AS HELL that I did read it.  It shows the world where super heroes have done a great job of getting rid of the bad guys and then themselves vanishing because there was no real need for them anymore.  I could put it down to sleep, do some work, and say hi to certain people.  Those were the only times I put it down.  I am happy I found it on Amazon for such a good price.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I thought that this was an awesome soundtrack. Movie soundtracks used to include songs \\"based on or inspired by\\" that were never featured in the film. Thank goodness this trend has ended. With the Twilight soundtrack, every song featured is in the film. I love all of the songs. While I listen to them I think of which moment of the film they appeared. Isn't that what a soundtrack is supposed to do-remind you of moments in the film? In particular, I love Full Moon by the Black Ghosts. I also loved Bella's theme. I thought about Bella and Edward in the trees and Edward playing piano for Bella.   If you loved the movie, then you will love the soundtrack.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|The only word for this is \\"spectacular\\".  As a died in the wool ABBA fan it met and exceeded my expectations.  In BluRay the scenery comes alive and the music better than the old CDs.  This will be one we will play over and over.  Meryl and Amanda have beautiful voices and they really hit the notes.
B0018AM1ZS|5.0|If you like instrumental music, movie soundtracks, or the Lord of the Rings movies you will love this soundtrack.    It has many of the sounds of the movie and the songs are great for when you want something quieter without being boring.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|Me and my family enjoyed this movie, enough to buy it.  My son watches it over and over again.  If you like sci-fi with flashback sequences then you'll love this one.
B000056NX5|4.0|This is a wonderfull stage prduction.  I like it better then the oringal movie.
1401216676|5.0|First off, Amazon did a great job with speed and care of the delivery.  The Killing joke has to be one of my favorite graphic novels and I am happy I was able to add it to my collection with the help of Amazon.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Outstanding product! I was at first concern that this controller didn't feature rumble, but then realize it was because i was playing a game that didn't have rumble! Cod4! So i played another game  star wars force unleashed and there was rumble! This is a great product, but very expensive! It feels very strong, but for a price like that, I'd keep it away from little kids. I highly recommend getting this product!
B001GQACGO|5.0|I have to admit this is the first Beyonce' CD I have in my collection.  Given as a Christmas Gift, it was requested after hearing the song \\"I am a boy.\\"  I am...Sasha Fierce is a deluxe edition including The I AM CD and the Sasha Fierce CD.  The I AM CD is amazing.  Musically well done. Songs include I am a Boy, Ava Maria, Halo...the list goes on.  Every song on that side is a hit. One of her songs reminds you of a song by the artist Jewel. I believe she has captured a broader audience with this CD.<br /><br />The Sasha Fierce CD is just okay.  With only one or two songs that are worth hitting the repeat button, I would still recommend it because of the price its like getting two CDs for the price of one.
B000002U9W|3.0|REVIEW: It's hard to imagine an album that is more celebrated for its art work than for its music. Yet despite its obvious flaws: \\"ATOM HEART MOTHER\\" is a tremendously appealing record that finds Pink Floyd (for the most part) in a rather lighthearted mood. The centerpiece IS \\"Atom Heart Mother\\": a classically-derived collaboration with compose Ron Geesin, neatly divided into six parts, and held together by a central theme that crops up from time to time until the thunderous coda which brings the whole shebang to a rousing end. It is a lovely, albeit weird (those slightly sinister choir singers which reminded me a bit too much of \\"THE OMEN\\"), orchestral meisterwerk that the Floyd were especially proud of even though they would later out do it with their own follow up release \\"MEDDLE\\" (and its side-long epic \\"Echoes\\"). Still, the thing does cast a sweet enchantment over the listener. Side two of the LP version was a bit more down-to-earth: three short ballads (one each by Waters, Wright, and Gilmour) that, at first, don't seem like much; but after a few listens begin to assert themselves as quite top-notch in spite of their modest presentation. For example: Waters' \\"If\\" seems plaintive, almost dull, until the loveliness of the acoustic/electric guitar counterpart mixed in with Wright's airy piano and Nick Mason's gentle swipes on the drum kit make for a very haunting composition (especially when you digest the lyrics which are filled with references to insanity, \\"wires in the brain\\", and the \\"spaces between friends\\" that smacks of the estrangement between Waters and former Pink Floyd bandleader Syd Barrett). Wright's \\"Summer '68\\" is another pessimistic account of life on the road (a la \\"Paintbox\\"). But this time the venom is for a groupie who becomes the target of his own self-loathing. However viscious the lyrics: the music itself is the most appealing of the three songs (which utilizes the same fanfare horns as on \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" to give the track an almost Beatle-esque pop feel). Gilmour's \\"Fat Old Sun\\" is a perfect title for this lazy, rolling number that incorporates some of his most exquisite guitar playing. All good and well there: but it is the finale of \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" that brings the album to a grinding halt. Usually with the Floyd they can come up with great ideas on the spot, and bring the musical goods to back it. Here they come up with a fantastic idea, some awesome special effects, and absolutely the most inconsequential music to accompany it. The country-ish piano opener \\"Rise And Shine\\", the lovely acoustic/electric guitar duet \\"Sunny Side Up\\", and the easy-going studio jam of \\"Morning Glory\\" do manage to capture that cheerful, brand-new-day feel even though it is (in the group's own words) the most \\"throw together\\" thing they have ever done; and certainly doesn't hold up as a worthwhile Pink Floyd track. However, one misstep doesn't mar what is still a most enjoyable and overlooked recording.    HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 56    HIT SINGLES: Nonee that says a lot about his friendship with former Floyd leader Syd Barrett. But because of the adult subject matter and the sexual references: the LP should earn a mild CAUTIONARY rating for its content.      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 56    HIT SINGLES: None
B00197U0EY|5.0|This was a gift for my new son-in-law. he is into this type of music, and had placed it on his Christmas list. I did all his shopping on line and was able to purchase everything at a reasonable price and was send in time for gift giving.
B00005Y1UX|4.0|A lot has already been said about the flaws of this movie, and I have to agree: Demie Moore is wooden (but then again, I never considered her a good actress, although I do think that she is a stunning natural beauty); Robert Redford just a tad too old (again - love the guy AND the acting, but still...), but above all, the plot has holes, the dialogue is flat and the characters lack dimension.    However, I'd like to come to the defense of two instances, which everyone agreed to hate:  1.  Woody Harrelson's role.  I do not think he was miscast.  Although he is definitely no match for Robert Redford looks-wise, I think he pulls off the role quite well.  Yes, he's not the perfect man that Robert Redford is, but then again, few men are...  And one does not need to be perfect to be loved.    The scene where he has the change of heart is quite touching, he is convincing throughout (the look he gives the tourist who jokes that his wife might not come back?!), and demonstrates enough emotions even without speaking to render the final scene poignant.    I also did not find his character lazy or whiny (recession, anyone?), nor do I remember him doing too much cursing...    2.  The hippo thing.  I thought it was one of the best things in the movie and one of its few redeeming features.  I loved the line, and I loved the logic behind it: the money gained frivolously could only be spent frivolously (and, in this case, also wonderfully symbolically) to find redemption and forgiveness.      I would definitely not go as far as to call this movie a classic, nor do I think that it's particularly mind-blowing (or immoral, for that matter), but it's an entertaining film, with some good chemistry and nice scenes.  Above all, it sets the mood rather well, and if you happen to be in a mood that matches, you'd enjoy the movie at least once.  As for owning it - I'd wait to watch it once first...
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Watched this on TV last year and can not believe how much I missed. Excellent series would highly recommend.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|Este disco, de verdad es algo que no puede faltar a quien le guste Sigúr Ros. Ara Batur, es la mejor pieza del disco. Es en vivo, y es una sensación inexplicable la que transmite. El disco es muy bueno. Viene en un sobre muy bien hecho. Es un disco que recomiendo. Lastima que la versión Deluxe cueste 115$!
B000QQFKYE|5.0|The more times you watch this film, the easier you will recall dialogue that at first seemed random.  The repetition of sentences and images is no mere coincidence.  Do not dismiss any word or image as superfluous.  If you formulate your own theory as to what the plot is about, the movie will play out exactly to that, and will make perfect sense to you.<br /><br />Imagine your average film is a road that takes you from A to B.  INLAND EMPIRE is a cube with roads on every side, and you are traveling through the entire alphabet, though not in it's original order...<br /><br />GIVE THIS FILM A GO, BUT ONLY IF IT\\"S MORE THAN ONCE.
B000HT386M|5.0|I love Amazon.com.  I ordered several DVDs as Christmas gifts.  I received Click before I even checked on the shipment.  It came in perfect, new condition.  I always start with Amazon before I venture out.  Thank you.
6305882592|4.0|This is a rather short movie that I first saw years ago. It's about a young man who is trying to figure out life and an older woman who lives life to the fullest. It's humerus and inspiring. It's a bit contrived but good movie to watch if you are feeling a little down about life or anytime really.

B001F7MSG6|5.0|We saw this movie last summer...loved it.  When it was available in Blu-Ray we had to have it.  We watched the first Hellboy in DVD....excellent on the Blu-Ray machine....then Hellboy II on Blu-Ray in the Sony Blu-Ray machine....unbelievable.  We never knew how good a movie could look before we went with this system.  Blu-Ray is state of the art...at least for now.
B0018CWEYY|4.0|If you have any hope of following the new season thats starts next week, and you got bored/frustrated last season and fell off the boat, get this set and spend 2 or 3 evenings getting caught up.  The foreshadowing really helps the stories mesh again and most of the annoying characters get short shrift so its fun again.  Only 14 episodes on 4 discs.  however all the special features, 2 discs worth, really aren't.  I guess you could just watch then/download online, buts its nice to have the sets.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I gave this DVD series to my boyfriend as a Christmas gift, and he was thrilled.  It was highly acclaimed while it was on the air and after, and I can see why.  We've been watching it together, so I can tell you that it's a dramatic, well-acted story with beautiful cinematography.  It would interest people who don't usually like \\"war movies\\" (like myself).
B000J4QWMC|5.0|This film is like an episode of 'Cops', only with Ferraris and Speed-sorry, Go Fast Boats.  It's shot exactly how I would make a film, gritty and raw, with realistic sound design.  There's something intriguing about this film, believe it or not!  I've seen it so many times.  I don't know what it is.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|A great movie...Heath Ledger was amazing as The Joker.  Action packed with great acting by the entire cast.
B000069KGM|5.0|This year (2009) will mark the 40th anniversary of this album and so I thought I would take the time to throw in my 5 stars for this CD.  After all these years this album has remained one of the best in Chicago's catalog and many of this tracks are still concert standards for the band.  Out of the 10 songs here, last year when I saw Chicago in concert they played 5 of these songs: Introduction (a great concert opener), Beginnings, Questions 67 & 68, I'm A Man, and Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?.  That is considerably more than they played off of any of their other album.  In fact a good percentage of their live show are songs from their most creative period that some would argue ended with their masterpiece \\"Chicago V\\".<br /><br />Even if you have one of Chicago's Greatest Hits albums check this album out.  Many of Chicago's early hits were edited for radio and here you can get these songs in their long form and you can hear them the way they were meant to be heard.  Also this is where Chicago lived up to it's original mission statement, a rock band with horns.  If you love the hits most all the album tracks are not filler and really showcase their rock side.  The only other album I would recommend to showcase their early jazz/rock sound would be \\"Chicago V\\".<br /><br />Though I am giving this album 5 starts it isn't perfect.  Many here have complained about the track \\"Free Form Guitar\\".  It is pretty much over 6 minutes of feedback created by Terry Kath's guitar.  It in no way can be considered music and it pretty much ruins the flow of I pretty good album.  Some argue that it showcases the talents of Terry but if it is just noise why is it on the album and with that said why isn't it the final track?  Also the track Liberation is a little long clocking in just shy of 15 minutes.  It is pretty much a 15 minute jam session.  I do enjoy it sometimes but it really is pretty long and I usually skip it.<br /><br />Though it isn't perfect, Chicago Transit Authority continues to be one of Chicago's most respected and most loved albums by fans and critics and like the band it has now lasted to it's 40th year and has aged very well.  If you don't have it check it out.e of Chicago's most respected and most loved albums by fans and critics and like the band it has now lasted to it's 40th year and has aged very well.

0545128285|1.0|As harry potter lover, I did not like this book. It looks too clich&eacute; and I found no magical aura about the short stories inside the book.<br /><br />Not a masterpiece for sure!
0545128285|5.0|I gave this to my boyfriend as a gift for Christmas.  He loved it, and since I've read it I can attest that it's a wonderful compilation of wizard fairy tales (with essays by Dumbledore after each story).  It took only about an hour to read the entire thing, but it was worth it :)
B00168OINK|5.0|This movie, my 3 year old son just watched over, and over, and over again. Even my parents loved this movie! Reconmended for parents with kids who loves martial arts!
1567184855|5.0|This book was something that completely amazed and satisfied me. I started reading it and could not stop until I had finished it. The questions about life after death and the phase IN-BETWEEN lives have been answered very well. Questions about life on other planets also answered. The concept of different levels of the soul and soul groups is fascinating. This is a book that will answer many questions. It will also remove your fear of death and while life has to lived to its full potential, you understand that this is not the end of life and life never really ends, its all part of the grand adventure that spans lifetimes, planets, other dimensions and universes.<br /><br />After reading this book, I bought copies for family, friends and more copies for myself. I am waiting to read \\"Destiny of Souls\\", which I have just ordered.
B00006FR47|5.0|I was born a Chicago fan with both my parents being fans of this band before I was born I was exposed to this music at a very early age and so when I was at an age where I started buying music I started collecting everything I could find with the Chicago logo on it.  Over time I began to whittle my collection down a bit because I discovered that many of the albums I really didn't like much beyond the hits and some of Chicago's albums from the late 70s are (sadly) a little to painful to listen to.  Of the few albums I kept, this one has over time become my favorite.<br /><br />The reason this album works so well is that it is short.  Chicago's first 3 albums were double LPs where this was their first single album.  THis works because the early albums had a lot of fillers and some extended cuts that went a little long (one example is from Chicago II \\"Better End Soon\\" that is over 10 minutes long.  It starts out being about the War in Vietnam but ends up being a song about it's self if you get my point).  What is great is there is enough variety to keep this album interesting and most of the songs are not \\"love\\" songs which dominated the group's catalog on pretty much every album after this one.  You have the fusion jazz rock songs like \\"A Hit by Varese\\" and \\"Now That You've Gone\\", the wonderful hit \\"Saturday In The Park\\", and the great wars time song \\"Dialogue 1&2\\".  I recently looked up Billboard chart info on this album and discovered that not only did it go number one on the Pop album chart, it was also number one on the Jazz album chart as well.  Of all of Chicago's albums this one deserves the Jazz/Rock status.  It's too bad albums like this don't make it to those top 200 definitive album lists.  Oh well.<br /><br />If you assumed that this album is a soft rock album based on \\"Saturday In The Park\\" and avoided this please give this one a chance.  \\"Saturday In The Park\\" is probably the lightest song on the album and really sounds nothing like the rest of the tracks.

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|In GRAN TORINO, Clint Eastwood has pulled off the rarest of Hollywood trifectas, a hugely successful film in which the lead actor also directs and produces. Clint is Walter Kowalski.  Think of Kowalski as an embittered, racist Dirty Harry who, twenty years prior, has turned in his badge. His wife of fifty years dies in the opening credits.  He is vastly disappointed in his sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren, all of whom wish him to wrap up his affairs with them as the assorted beneficiaries.  It is only midway through that we learn the reason for his being ornery.  During the Korean war he killed a number of the enemy, including one who was trying only to surrender.  There has not been a single night that his conscience does not torment him.  His memories lead him to drown in incessant racism toward Asians.  Into this volatile mix, come a neighborhood of Hmong, one family of whom lives directly next door.  Kowalski and the Hmong size each other up, mostly in a negative way.  It is only at the point of an abortive attempt by one of them, Tao (Bee Vang), to steal the Gran Torino of the title that Kowalski begins to look past the long entrenched prejudices of his past.  Kowalski befriends Tao, but would never admit to calling it that.  Instead, he allows himself to accept what the Hmong call a repayment of a favor when he saves Tao from a beating by some local gang bangers.<br /><br />Part of the joy of GRAN TORINO is to see just how much Eastwood can emote with merely a glance or a scowl. He spares no one, least of all himself. When he sees his valley girl granddaughter act like the airhead she is at his funeral, he winces.  When he sees some local thugs harrass Tao's sister, he winces too, but in this latter case, his evolution as a human being leads him to recognize that in helping others he is also helping himself regain his own moral compass.  The latter half of the film details how Kowalski slowly and then more rapidly insinuates himself into a Hmong culture whose outward differences are outward mostly in detail, but in the things that count, their culture and his intertwine at more than one thread.  Eastwood plays Kowalski as a man who has learned some truly bitter lessons from a life that has yet one more to give.  But this last lesson (which I shall not reveal here) is the sternest test yet of his ability to shed some much unneeded baggage in his quest to rejoin the human race.  GRAN TORINO is truly the best picture of the year.outward differences are outward mostly in detail, but in the things that count, their culture and his intertwine at more than one thread.

B00006CXSS|5.0|After viewing this collection, my husband and I were awestruck.  We came home each night from work and were determined to watch another dvd.      I purchased this set as a gift for a man who was a Marine during this time period.  He was awarded the purple heart.  He was so touched by this gift.    Rarely do we find a series that is so filled with emotion and integrity.

1400082773|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book.  I thought I might be disappointed and feel like I had been sucked into reading a promo-piece for a campaign.  But once I allowed for the possibility it was all a hyped up spin, and as with any book, I could ditch it when it was not worth the time, I began reading over a Hawaii vacation in December 2008.    Realizing it was written in 1995, way before Obama's political formation was solidified, it was interesting on just that level.  But really, the message and insights were not about anything particualary political.  It is the story of a bi-racial child in a multi cultural country (yes, the United States) and his search for his place in the world.  It is the ultimate Jopseph Campbell journey for self.  Perhaps a great gift for teenager/young adult.  Very easy to follow and great excerpts into other worlds.    And the writing in 99% beautiful and flowing, with some excess and a few trite moments, but overall, it is a wonderful book to read on so many levels.
B00005NGAL|5.0|This isn't exactly what I would call a movie. What they did was they recorded, very well might I add, the broadway version of the musical Cats. It is like you are there sitting in the first row of the theathre watching the broadway version. Cats is basically about all these cats getting together for a yearly celebration. Each cat introduces another cat and talks about them and what they are like. It is like a whole bunch of little short stories. There is nothing but singing and dancing. I don't think there is any speaking at all. I highly recommend this to those who love Cats and the broadway musical of it. They actually did act some and moved around the stage. Some movies of musicals that I have watched in the past, the actors would just dress up in coustumes and sing in one little place. They didn't do that here. You actually got to see them act which is a pluse. They also have special effects that I liked. I always wanted to see Cats and now after watching this I felt like I had.     Kristy Star Sisk
B001MDXOBQ|1.0|This album says it's the explicit version yet it still has the swears edited out.  Is that a typo or something?  This is my first time trying amazon's MP3 download service and already I've lost trust in it.    [EDIT] Amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase because of the mistake.  It took them less than 12 hours so kudos to them.  As far as I know though, this album download is still edited so buyer beware.

B00005JLF5|5.0|I am a deep lover of Star Trek. The first season wasn't bad but the seasons that follow it was better. It started getting interesting when Odo met his first changling and whenever they had the war. However that is not in the first season of which this is. This season is how they all met each other. Basically. And it is whenever they moved to Deep Space Nine. It is basically introducing the characters. There was some really good eposides but I am aware that there are better seasons to Deep Space Nine than the first one.     Kristy Star Sisk

B001F0VHEM|5.0|Pink's newest release, The Funhouse is every thing you expect it to be, Sexy, Sassy and more.  We love it!
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Bought this for my son for Christmas.  It comes with a code for downloading a digital copy -- which apparently you REALLY need, since the DVD won't play in his computer in any watchable way even after updating his media player.  I also find the sound really annoying on this DVD -- we have to constantly adjust it up for hard-to-hear dialogue and down for the incredibly loud music.  A friend found hers wouldn't even play properly in her DVD player.  So ... yeah, it's the movie and he loves that movie.  But save the receipt until you're sure it works, and keep track of that digital copy code because the disk production is funky.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|THE definitive show of the mid '90's.  If you were around age 14-16 in the mid 90's or just love that grunge teen angst era this is all you need to put you right back in that time frame.  Cutting edge at the time (and even today for it's focus on the entire family) this show has it all plus music from the time and great outfits.  Who doesn't love Jordan (Jared Leto)  in his corduroy coat?  A must buy for any great TV on DVD collection. Was SO excited when it was finally reissued after years of being out of print.
0812523334|5.0|I'm reading it and the more I read the more I love it! I can't wait to finish it!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|So what can you say? Great flick.<br /><br />I love this thing. Got it as a Christmas present and will take as many Pixars as I can get. Loved \\"Cars\\" maybe just a tad bit more (grandson's favorite doncha know?).
B001KMB6X2|1.0|I really wanted to see this in a theater but at the last minute chickened out as a barrage of poor reviews came out. Boy am I glad I waited to use a free rental Redbox coupon to see this one. It starts out very cool. And to be honest about 85% of the movie is pretty good. The fx are good and the locations are very cool. Vin D is what you'd expect. But there are some very confusing parts, and the ending possibly one of the all-time worst ever! As far as I can tell, and I think a lot of others will agree, it doesn't make ANY sense, even in the context of this strange movie. If you can see this for a $1 or for free, and are still interested even after reading all the bad reviews, then go for it. But you have to be nuts to pay good money to buy this on DVD without seeing it first.
B000MRAAJW|2.0|don't purchase from music gods unless you are absolutly sure because they will not cancel any order. I ordered from them at about 8pm on christmas day and about two hours later asked them to cancel this order. i recieved an email that they could not cancel it because it had already shipped. i seriously doubted the were able to ship something on christmas day between the hours of 8 and 10 pm!! so do not purchase from musicgods unless you are absolutely sure. the video itself is awesome!!!
0790729393|5.0|It is a sad story, but wow it is a great movie with awesome actors!!!
B00000I07R|4.0|Highlights: In These Arms, Bed of Roses, I Want You. Lowlights: If I Was Your Mother (kinda creepy). A lot of good songs.
B001BWDG0W|4.0|I say surprisingly good because I was afraid there would be a giant departure from the original music.  So many artists these days try to make cover songs their own and it rarely enhances the original score.  They stayed so close to the original music that sometimes it sounds like ABBA is singing it.    Another gem is that the cast is singing the songs in the movie and on the soundtrack, which isn't always the case (i.e. Moulin Rouge Soundtrack doesn't use the actors singing and instead uses the original artists music).    Unfortunately Pierce Brosnan simply isn't a singer and the songs which include his recordings are too much for me.  Sorry Pierce, you're a very good actor, and you gave it a valiant effort, but I get a full body shudder when I listen to you sing, thus the four stars.    Oh, and Amanda Seyfried belts out some beautiful songs!
B0007PAMR4|5.0|This is a very stirring movie.  Paul triumphs and avenges his fathers death.  It's a pretty simple plot but the movie pulls me in every time.    It had been awhile since I'd seen the extended television version and after my recent viewing I'd have to agree with Lynch that it is inferior.  I guess more is not always better.    I do have one quibble with the theatrical version.  Why in heavans name did Lynch cut the Thufir Hawat death scene.  It is a powerful moving scene even without a score.    Like other reviewer have written, I hope someday that Lynch realizes what an amazing piece of art he crafted.  How can he not like this movie.
B001EYGOEM|3.0|This was a Christmas gift for my grand-daughter. It was on her wish list and I was happy to see that we would not have to find some other item associated with Barbie dolls. Although it has been 55 years since I left my teens, I can still remember the joy of having my own music (45 rpm record). I know the teens like this artist.
B00000I07Q|4.0|Highlights: Born to Be My Baby, Stick to Your Guns, I'll Be There for You, 99 in the Shade. Lowlights: Homebound Train. A lot of good songs.
B001B56JBC|5.0|Awesome, comes to mind! The material is mind altering. You know im from LA, and  was a tad too young for this show. However, i did catch him at the Forum, four years later!Being an audiophile, im very impressed by the sonics of this recording! Best recording of this show, yet!
B000SMWUPS|3.0|this stroller caddy is okay. the velcro straps are in odd places for strollers with a one-piece handlebar.
B001E7X4M4|5.0|I personally dont listen to this type of music, I bought it for my daughter' boyfriend, judging from the reaction I got from him, I'd say it was a hit. he told me he listened to it all the way home.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies in a loooooong time.  If you haven't seen this movie, get your butt in gear and get it.  You won't be sorry.
B001OSIV62|4.0|An entertaining and at times suspenseful documentary. It is less about the tightrope walking and more about a man's passion for new heights, literally and figuratively. Some segments of the documentary played out like a heist of some sort. Like the time they masqueraded as French media to gain rooftop access. It was quite fun to watch.

B000001FSR|5.0|\\"Franks Wild Years\\" was my first Tom Waits album.    I bought it for $20 @ Musicland for no particular reason other than the advice of a hipster cashierette that I wanted to bed.      I plugged the tape into my car and was a fan within 50 seconds.    I dunno, you either get it or you do not.  I know that I laughed like a mo-fo as the tape stated to unreel and cried like a bitch for the rest...     Waits writes beautiful music.  His ruined voice might obscure the pungency of his intent, but the advanced astringent economy of  his delivery makes due for just aout every f'n thing.
B001EN71CW|5.0|My husband is a huge Sci-Fi addict and had seen all these shows before.  For Christmas He got his new 46\\" plasma, 120hz flatscreen, blueray, so I ordered him a couple of movies as presents.  I'd never seen this series before, and I literally watched all 13 or 14 episodes, back to back, without interuption.  Wow, this was an awesome series and should never have been cancelled.  I recommend this for everyone who enjoys excellent writing, great characters, and great humor.
B000M341QE|5.0|My favorite movie of all-time.  This is a great irish mafia, gangster movie.  Te director and cast are all A-Listers and the movie has a lot of action and twists.  A must for any dvd collection.  Best movie of 2006, by far!

B000HEWEJO|5.0|I'm 59 years old and have seen almost every Christmas movie except for It's a Wonderful Life.  It was well worth the wait.  Jimmy Stewart is one of the most belieavable actors I have ever seen. It is a heart warming story, that leaves you thinking when it's over. Now every time I hear a bell ring, a smile comes to my face.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|What a feast for the eyes! It's a little quirky, very beautiful and a fun little story. It is hard to understand the little girl, but she is so darn adorable it really doesn't matter! The end is a little contorted and seems like the writer and director couldn't quite decide how to wrap it up. But all in all just beautiful, weird, exciting and fun.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Great movie.  Angelina Jolie gives an oscar-winning performance.  I saw this in the theaters and had to pre-order the dvd.  Clint Eastwood is a very underated director.  This is about a mother whose son becomes missing.  I don't like to give movies away, but you can really feel Angelina's emotions and sadness.  Great movie.
B000UNYJV8|5.0|Great film--A coming of age too soon tale of young newbie skinhead.  All the young actors were masterfully directed.  Naturalistic and poignant.  Highly recommended.  A moment in time perfectly captured.
0956010903|5.0|Great book and I am happy that some of the proceeds are used to help needy kids.
0312383320|4.0|I was originally going to pass on Plum Spooky.  The last two Stephanie Plum Between-the-Numbers Novels were extremely short, lightweight, and I thought, not worth the money.  But when I saw that Plum Spooky was over 300 pages, I thought I'd give it a try.  Is it great mystery?  Nope!  Is it believable?  Absolute not!  But is it amusing and will it have you laughing out loud in spots?  Without a doubt!  I was sitting in my doctor's waiting room reading about her trying apprehend a FTA (failure to appear) in a produce warehouse, laughing like a loon and having all the other patients wondering what I was reading.  Maybe it helps to be from New Jersey, and specifically, South Jersey.<br /><br />Trenton bounty hunter, Stefanie Plum, is up to her usual antics.  Behind in rent money, she tries to go after the bigger FTAs.  The biggest is Martin Munch, a child-sized genius who stole a magnetometer from his place of employment.  He now appears to be teamed up with Wulf Grimoire, an Unmentionable who is being tracked down by another type of bounty hunter, Diesel.  And to top it all off, a former client has dropped her pet monkey, Carl, off at Stephanie's to babysit while she's on vacation.  Munch's boss turns up dead and Munch and Grimoire disappear into the Jersey Pine Barrens.  We South Jersey natives grew up knowing that the Pine Barrens are filled with Pineys and haunted by the Jersey Devil.  But in Plum Spooky, the Pines are also filled with a weird group of characters including Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, Sasquatch, Elmer the Fire Farter and 20 monkeys.<br /><br />Unlike Evanovich's previous Between-the-Numbers Novels, Ranger, Morelli and Grandma Mazur all play a bigger role in Plum Spooky.  And as usual, there are firebombed houses, cars are destroyed, clothes are ruined and junk food is consumed.  Diesel also provides some competition for Morelli and Ranger in the love department.  Evanovich's writing also shows her special appreciation for the Trenton Burg.  \\"I was raised in the Burg, where death is more a social opportunity than a tragic event.  Viewings and wakes hold the potential for a decent food spread and free-flowing alcohol.  It's one of the few occasions when throwing back whiskey at ten in the morning is in good form.\\"<br /><br />So yes, maybe Plum Spooky is a little over the top.  But overall, I still found it amusing in most sections and belly-laughing funny in others.the Burg, where death is more a social opportunity than a tragic event.

0345438205|1.0|Whilst 2001 has a certain mythical grandeur, and left the reader with a sense of awe and wonder, and is one of the greatest works of the twentieth century, Clarke's conclusion of the story one thousand years later is highly unimaginative and much more like 'standard' science fiction.     To those readers enthralled by 2001, and to some part, 2010, I strongly advise that you do not read 2061, and certainly not 3001, lest the wonderous illusion of the original story be shattered in an instant.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for this band to make an album like Death Magnetic. After all the past interviews I've read from James, Lars, and Kirk in the mid 90's about them being finished with making songs like My Apocalypse, All Nightmare Long, and That Was Just Your Life.. I figured that they would stick to their word. They are quite stubborn after all. But there is still money to be made in the hurting music industry, and I'm sure this album is somewhat inspired by the staggered economy that they're trying to survive in. I knew there would be complaints about Rick Rubin's post 90's signature blasted out production style. He's been doing this ever since Slayer's 'Diabolus In Musica', Chili Pepper's 'Californication', and Rage Against The Machine's 'Renegades' album, most notably. I've gotten used to his newer sound. Death Magnetic sounds cleaner to me, although I can see the comparison to his other work. Yet, I dont think there is one weak song on this album. It's Metallica revisiting their first four albums styles in their mid-forties. If they were to retire next month, this album would be a great note to go out on.

B001GZ6QDS|4.0|The 1st disc, the feature, is great.  I love that this includes a free digital copy, for my iTunes.  My only gripe is the 2nd disc, the bonus features, which is anemic.  There were 2 small behind the scenes features, vs., on the Batman Begins two disc a good 7 or 8.  It's like Chris Nolan didn't want us seeing behind the curtain on how he worked, which I respect.  But, then don't include a 2nd disc, which, of course, is not in Nolan's hands at all, but is a decision made by Warner Bros.  Still.  Boo on the 2nd disc.  And would it kill you, Chris, to include a Director Commentary?

B0000DKMK0|3.0|this is suppose to be QTs attempt at the martial arts vengeance movie. it is stylish and extremely bloody. but it lacks the dialogue and the street grit of pulp fiction. there is a great opening scene cat fight but the movie wanders afterwards. the characters do not seem real, more cartoonish than actual people. there are some of the old QT movie cliches that you will recognize, but it seems a little outdated now. the fighting is lacking simply because you are dealing with amateurs, not bruce lee. the older QT gets, the more he seems to rely on more blood and guts, less story and humor. QT got lucky with pulp fiction and has yet to match the old magic.

0767810856|4.0|This movie is simply about two nice people who end up with crappy marriage partners and find each other.  They fall in love and live happily ever after.  Their \\"exes\\" get what they deserve.  Hardly a complicated plot.<br /><br />After reading the good and bad reviews on this movie, it is disheartening to see how many people seem to think every movie must be neck deep in reality to be enjoyable.  This movie is based on a true story - but it is only a movie!  It's not a documentary nor intended to be.  The critics must think that writers, directors, and actors are idiots because they can't see what's *wrong* with the script.<br /><br />It's the kind of movie you watch if you're a romantic or just want to believe the world isn't as crappy a place as it treated you today.  So open a bottle of your favorite drink, take off your shoes, and sit back to see two good actors put a smile on your face.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Babel is a collection of seemingly unrelated stories much like Crash and Syriana. The films sucks at least as much as those too. There is no central character, and nobody is a better person for their experiences. This movie is basically the worst day in the lives of several people. The two lessons to be learned from this movie are 1) Do not use occupied vehicles for target practice, and 2) Do not leave the country while babysitting.

B0012QE4Q2|2.0|If this film had been based on the life of a fictional King of England, I would not have had a problem with it. However, as it is presented as an account of the lives of Henry VIII and the Boleyn sisters, packing a staggering disregard for historical accuracy, it gets rather low marks in my book.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the list of inaccuracies is too long and complex to even begin to tackle, but I can't resist citing a few: for starters, Mary is considered to have been the older sister; the King had tired of Mary before taking a fancy to Anne so there was never any competition there; Anne and Mary were not thought to be close and Mary was not present at Anne's execution. Though painted as pure and chaste, Mary had already been the mistress of King Francis I of France before she made her way into Henry VIII's bed, and had a solid reputation of promiscuity at the French court where she and Anne both spent time. While it is portrayed as a matter of fact that Mary gave birth to the King's son, in reality the child was thought to be that of Mary's first husband William Carey, and Henry VIII never acknowledged the boy as his. However the King did acknowledge the son of a previous mistress, Elizabeth Blount, so perhaps the characters of Mary and Bessie are merged into one in the film. In one scene, Mary reads aloud a few sentences of a love letter from the King which was actually one he had written to Anne. In another, the King assaults Anne sexually before their marriage which almost certainly did not happen. Though he was indeed a tyrant and thought nothing of sending whomever he so desired to their brutal deaths, personally administering violence didn't appear to be his thing.  And some of the most important figures behind the scenes of Anne's ultimate undoing are nowhere to be found, while others, like Anne's uncle the Duke of Norfolk, seems to be merged with the notably absent Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cranmer.<br /><br />The film does get afew minor points right. Both Anne and her father were highly ambitious manipulative schemers, the King went all out to rid himself of his first wife Katherine (though the complexity of the circumstances behind this would have filled up a six week mini-series and is only dealt with fleetingly in the film). And of course, Anne did lose her head in the end.<br /><br />Only die hard fans of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansen should bother, with the understanding that practically nothing in it is based in actual fact; those interested in a history lesson should pass it up.<br /><br />Despite the foregoing, lead actresses performed rather admirably, especially since neither is English, and Portman had captured the essence of who Anne probably really was, if perhaps slightly less evil. Eric Bana as King Henry VIII was generally fine, and I especially liked Anna Torrent as Queen Katherine. On a trivial side note, Henry and Queen Katherine, his Spanish first wife, were both redheads, but are rarely protrayed as such.
B001I82RVS|5.0|I love this movie. Its not a dry psychological thriller, (I have to been in the mood for those,) instead its packed with gracious amounts of fluids. Wet films like this draw me in because I'm a sucker for the genre. There are scenes of spraying blood that rival Kill Bill. There is an interesting urine scene with urine being sprayed into a man's mouth.<br />This movie is everything that was missing from Machine Girl. It took the gory fun of that movie and pushed it up several notches.<br />What I also liked, was that it actually has a plot. It wasn't just random.<br />It helps that the leading actress, Eihi Shiina who plays Ruka, is super hot. I probably would have still liked it if Shiina was just average but it really does help to have someone this beautiful in it. Her beauty creates a pleasing contrast to the blood, torture, carnage, and gore. When she sees a good friend suffering as that friend is being pulled apart by several police cars, you see the friend crying out in pain as limbs are being ripped out and then you see Ruka pretty face which creates a balance. Some horror movies use humor in between graphic scenes but this one uses beauty. Just as in the beginning you see a pretty flower, followed by a man's head exploding, its the interesting tension between beauty and gore that draws you into the world of Tokyo Gore Police.<br />I also love how it parodies Japanese society with commericals of giggling schoolgirls selling cute (Kawaii) exacto knives for potiental suicides. If you make anything cute, it will catch on with Japanese youth no matter how deranged your product is. It is also equally amusing to see the Wii parody, as a happy family enjoyes using a wireless sword controller to slash up some poor sap on TV.<br />I thought it was going to be just another brainless gorefest and I was surprised at how much I actually liked it.<br />If you're squeamish, its not for you at all. I've seen thousands of horror films and nothing bothers me anymore. What makes this film work for me is in its presentation of violence and gore. It shows you scenes of chainsaws cutting, swords slashing, and a penis gun shooting with a fresh angle. It some ways it reminds me of Miike's Ichi the Killer and Audition but with a less serious tone and a lot more fun. Its a great film to watch and unwind to. Certain films I have to be in the mood for and movies like this I'm always in the mood for.<br />So if you are interesting in seeing a beautiful lady literally cutting up her fellow Tokyoites, then this is your movie too.me is in its presentation of violence and gore.

0307265730|4.0|Unaccustomed Earth consists of 8 short stories, all dealing with lives of Bengali immigrants.  I consider all of the stories excellent and could have been written in any era, regarding any ethnic families.  My favorite stories were probably the last three, in which the lives of two children are followed through adulthood.      Some of the preceeding reviews I have come upon discuss this fiction being overly melodramatic, even depressing.  At times they were so.  On the other hand, I feel that each story brings out how fragile our lives really are and how we should cling tenaciously to every desire to improve our familial condition.  I have learned something from each of the stories and believe future readers will grasp the true meaning of this book.

Mr. Lincoln was an amazing man. It was truly divine intervention that he served his country at that time. I can't imagine what would have happened if he wasn't elected. I'm eager to learn more about Mr. Seward. I think it was a blessing that he too served in his capacity. Awesome book!
0316017922|2.0|I have read both \\"Blink\\" and \\"Tipping Point\\" and thoroughly enjoyed both of those books due to the fact that Mr. Gladwells thesis was very clear and well defended throughout the books with relating stories and scientific/economic fact. His third solo book, though, lacks both of these key components. I found him giving example after example of the exact same thing, and really taking 320 pages to defend a thesis that is already pretty obvious. My main complaint is that most people know/realize that in order to achieve success you need the right opportunities to fall into place, no way does a 320 page book need to be dedicated to this. This book was quite a dissapointment
B000BNX4MC|5.0|I couldn't believe what the guy on Amazon said about this movie?  I'm not even 16 yet and I loved this movie!!  The \\"Oh Yeah\\" song is my freaking RINGTONE!!  Like this movie is just for my parents!  Rediculous.    This movie is absolutely histerical, and the scene in the art museum is BEAUTIFUL!  Despite what the Amazon guy said, this is a film for everybody.  Adults love it because they have always loved it, and kids will love it because they've wanted to get out of school and do something crazy fun!  Sure, there are a couple of lewd scenes, but it's nothing that you can't close your kids ears during!    Seriously.    Get it.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I saw this movie in a theater last summer, and couldn't wait to get the DVD.  It is the best \\"feel good\\" movie I have ever seen, and I recommend it to anyone.  The music is wonderful, as are the actors.
031606792X|2.0|The first three books were AWESOME! I couldn't put them down. The last book left a lot to be desired in my opinion. What happened to the love that Bella and Edward shared? It seemed like it vanished and she cared more about what happened to Alice than Edward. Bella was funny and so was Edward, but you couldn't see any of the humor that I love in this last booK. Although I like Jacob a lot, I thought that he had too big of a part in Breaking Dawn. I would have like to see what Edward was thinking more than Jacob. I would have liked to see Bella rip apart Aro as well.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|Disc condition is great. Seen on a blu-ray is jaw dropping for a 1950's<br />movie.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This is my 'go to' cd anytime of the day. I love this artist's renditions of classics -- and his spirit and joy of performance comes through my speakers everytime. A must have purchase for any age listener.
B001KMB6X2|4.0|I enjoyed Babylon A.D. and purchased the Blu-ray from Amazon. Vin Diesel is not the bigger than life character seen in most of his other movies. He is tough but begins to show more human elements like caring and self-sacrifice. These are traits some don't expect in a Vin Diesel movie. The girl he is transporting from China to the U.S. is charismatic. She is hauntingly beautiful and appears to be a savior. She is fragile like in the Fifth Element, but turns out to be something completely different like Blade Runner.<br /><br />The action scenes are great and kept the movie exciting. Some scenes of the movie reminded me of Mad Max and Doomsday.<br />Strong performances from great actresses like Charlotte Rampling and Michele Yeoh also added positively to the movie.<br /><br />The ending was a disappointment as others mentioned. The movie is good but not great. It could have been better if it were made longer to develop story sub-plots.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is sharp and delivers powerful DTS Master Audio effects.<br />I liked the movie and will be watching it more than once.
B000TLMWMY|4.0|This is wonderful footage of the old Johnny Cash show with all kinds of stars singing with him.  A trip down memory lane!
B000NZL268|5.0|This is a great game for adults with various gaming skills.  I think children above 12 would also enjoy it.  We varied who played the blue pieces (and plays first in each round) for each round, as that did change the player's strategy.
B00005O3VC|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, given all the great things I'd heard about it. But for me, it was only \\"okay\\". The opening sequences were funny, the killer rabbit was good (though I had seen a clip of it before), the Black Knight scene was good, and the bridge sequence was hilarious. But I found much of the film impenetrable, unfunny, and sleep-inducing. I also don't understand the Python crew's obsession with casting each of the players in multiple roles, which I found confusing. I was surprised that the Camelot sequence was so short, I didn't get the inclusion of the modern police subplot, or the way it led to the aborted ending. I know I'm probably in the minority on this, but that's how I feel. To each his own.
B0017TWUZG|5.0|It seems many people were disappointed in this movie due to the lack of plot or, at best, a very simple one, and the sub-par acting. In fact, I was so convinced after reading all the reviews that I would not like it as much as I thought I originally would. Regardless, I saw it used and decided to give it a shot and, I have to say, I am keeping this one.     Yes, the acting is not the best and the plot was the way to keep it together, so they could call it a \\"movie\\" and not a \\"music video,\\" but I have absolutely no complaints or problems with that at all. If you search for any of the main \\"actors\\" their first occupation is not acting, it is dancing or choreography and, Sarah, the guardian, used to be a slam poet and Cassie (the source of conflict) is a professional singer and dancer by trade. Needless to say, they are not actors and it shows, but I wouldn't call their acting horrible, it was decent. Yet, the thing is, I don't think this movie would be half as good if they cast actors and tried to teach them how to dance, (they have reality shows for that) what really made this movie great was the dancing and you can tell that these guys are professionals in that respect, because I have never seen such phenomenal dancing in my life. Between the catchy and upbeat music and the amazing \\"popping,\\" \\"Krumping\\" and raw street dancing this movie is definitely one I will watch again and again. In fact, I cannot stop watching the final dances in the street, especially Adam Sevani (Moose) with that awesome routine to Timbaland's \\"Bounce.\\"     Anyway, despite what people are saying, if you like watching people dance to upbeat, high-energy music then definitely do yourself a favor and check this movie out.     Lastly, to comment briefly on the Blu Ray version. The picture quality is amazing, so much so, you can read what is on the shirts of those in the crowd and the sound is phenomenal. I can't tell you the exact specs, but what I can tell you is the picture is clear and vibrantand when they kick up the water during the dance scene in the rain, you truly feel as though you are going to get hit by the splash :) And, the sound is very clear, I have a 7.1 system set up but this DVD only does 5.1, but it makes up for it by giving me TrueHD.    All in all, if you are not concerned about a weak plot and poor acting, but really like watching phenomenal dancing, this is the movie for you. It definitely is for me.

6305558167|5.0|Excalibur is for adults...LOTR for grown-up children.  With its all-British cast and sexy Euro sensibilities, Excalibur is just one of those films I'll be proudly watching till grave-nappy time.  Dodgy accents, PG source material and whooshy effects make LOTR seem strangely inferior.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Michael makes some very good points. We need healthcare for everyone. We pay taxes which gives our politicans healthcare, but when we want it they tell us it's government run healthcare and it's wrong to have government run healthcare. If so they should give up their healthcare and buy it themselves like we have to.

0767020308|5.0|Well, if you're going to spend the money on the Emma movie, this IS the only version to buy.  Gwyneth Paltrow's version does not make the grade, in my opinion. She doesn't fit the part like Kate Beckinsale does. She's got the voice, accent, demeanor, and personality to fit the image of what Jane Austen portrays in her book.  This is the one to buy.  If you want to own this, trust me, rent both versions... you'll see what I mean.
B000071K5L|5.0|Matthew Razi  1/12/2009  English 1 honors  Schottler's class P4    TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a classic book that everyone should try to read this book.  The book is riddled with details of everything from the people to their scenery.  I would give it a five out of five star review.  This book was so popular with people that they actually made a movie about it, which is also a classic.  Besides the great story it tells TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is also unique.  This book was the only book that the author, Harper Lee, ever wrote.  The synopsis of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is about a southern lawyer, in Alabama in a sleepy little town called Maycomb during The Great Depression, who teaches his kids right from wrong and about how wrong it is to segregrate people and shows his kids firsthand through a trial about a black man who is on trial for rape.  The story takes place through the eyes of the youngest of the children who is called Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch.  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a captivating tale that \\"takes readers to the roots of human behavior-to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos.\\"  This book has sold over eighteen million copies in print and also has been translated into ten languages and today it is considered \\"a masterpiece of American Literature.\\"
0800141660|5.0|This movie is, without a doubt, my favorite in the romance/drama category. If you like romance, you can't go wrong with this movie. It's definitely a \\"chick flick\\" - I could never get my husband to watch this; however, I have watched this movie more than 15 times by myself and with friends.  Always the same outcome:  absolutely beautiful and full of emotion.  You'll love the ending!
B00005JPS8|5.0|Loved this movie.   I am not partial to super-hero movies, but watched this one after my kids (ages 14 and 12) watched it on their Air France flight and loved it themselves.   This is not your typical super hero movie, it's better.   Perhaps because the story of Iron Man as told in the comic books has more pragmatic beginnings, this movie is believable.  Excellent acting all around, excellent use of humor.  I've purchased it for gifts for my master stylist (who also loved it), and my brother (who turned me on to the 'bad' comic books like Iron Man and Batman when I was into the 'good' comics like Tweety and Slyvester).  I sure hope the ending suggests a sequel!
B000MRAAJW|2.0|I had no reason to believe that this set wouldn't play on my up-to-date, new DVD player!

Basically, I bought a very expensive SET OF COASTERS!!
0767903862|5.0|If only the authors of history books were as talented as Bill Bryson.  I started with Bill in \\"A Walk in the Woods\\", which I enjoyed as well.  Something about this book is even better.  I was laughing out loud within reading the first few pages--the way he described his first boogie boarding experience is to die for, very few books ever evoke that response of me.  This book is very informative, lots of interesting facts (and I'm not talking about the rather standard and basic facts you can find in an encyclopedia), discussed without stereotype, perfect for someone about to go to Australia (shouldn't everyone know what norks are without having to ask?) or who is interested in the history of Australia.   Bill's approach to travel as he describes his own adventures really inspires me to be more adventurous in my own travels.  I'm off on my next Bryson book.
0670019925|5.0|I've been a fan of Lodge's fiction ever since his second novel, _Ginger, You're Barmy,_ came out in 1962. His first few books were considered amusing but nothing special by the critics, but he hit his stride with _Changing Places_ in 1975. This latest work of fiction (because, as a professor of English, now retired, he has also written dense works on critical theory) is his fourteenth and it's an excellent example of how his early propensity for domestic comedy has evolved into commedia in almost the Dantean sense. Lodge is from southeast London but has spent all his adult academic life in Birmingham, and the present narrative, like several of his others, is set in both places. It's difficult to know how much of the detail of his books derives from his personal experiences but Desmond Bates, a retired professor of linguistics (not languages -- \\"it's a common mistake\\"), who is becoming more and more deaf, is certainly based on Lodge's own situation. In fact, the narrator's explicit puns on deafness (including the title) and the implicit frustration it causes him are very much the focus of the story. Though he's helped by high-tech hearing aids, and though more theaters are making wi-fi headphones available for deaf patrons, deafness makes social intercourse extremely difficult -- and yet it's not as dramatic and sympathy-drawing as blindness. It's hardly worth it to Desmond to try to teach, or to attend public functions or even dinner parties, since he misses so much now of what's going on. And since his somewhat younger second wife is becoming very successful with an upscale home decor business even as Desmond is entering the downside of his life, he feels even more isolated and frustrated. Then he's approached by a personable and blondely attractive American graduate student seeking advice (apparently) on her doctoral dissertation, the focus of which is a textual analysis of suicide notes. Desmond was a teacher for too long not to be aware of the pitfalls of becoming involved -- or even appearing to become involved -- with female students, and he doesn't even have official standing with the university any longer, but his loneliness seduces him into going beyond what his good sense warns him about. Still, he never does anything that quite stoops to B-movie farce, though he worries that he might have. Especially as he realizes that the girl is even weirder than he at first thought. Lodge is a master of the British art of drollery and wry self-observation and Desmond's interior monologues -- the only sort of conversation he's really comfortable with these days -- are smoothly developed in a complex way that seems effortless. That's the mark of a first-rate writer. Two of his novels have been shortlisted for the Booker Prize (Lodge himself chaired the committee one year), and I wouldn't be surprised if this one were as well.ng involved -- or even appearing to become involved -- with female students, and he doesn't even have official standing with the university any longer, but his loneliness seduces him into going beyond what his good sense warns him about.

B0000AQS6R|2.0|It had been many years since seeing this movie....and last time was probably a edited for tv version....my wife wanted to get it to have a \\"special\\" movie night with our grandsons age 8 and 12 when they stayed over holidays with us......yes it is a funny gag movie.....but the language and sexual inference (overt and more subtle both) were offensive to me, much less in showing to our grandsons....I had not recalled such language and offensive imagery (shooting the finger, dogs humping on scene, pool dream scene, etc. etc.) .... if I did, I would have never ordered it ... let buyer beware.

B000002KOG|5.0|As mentioned previously, the first edition of this album on vinyl was completely different from the soon remixed vinyl lp with the big white Neil Young banner across the top. If you ever see one with the painting full and no banner, pay whatever it takes. The overdubs and effects are very different than any version released since. Very layered, with none of the mixed-to-the-top guitars of version b. 1a all makes better sense. A couple of songs are ruined by bringing background rhythm guitar to the top. Jack Nitzche's oversight was meant to be as originally mixed and is also one of his best, if not his best production(s).  Very much an extension of the experimentaion on Buffalo Springfield Again, Neil Young 1a is very psychedelic and makes a very trippy adventure completely unlike anything since.   I love raw Neil, and Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere is fabulous in a whole different way. But this first mix of Neil Young needs to see CD release. Please Neil.  This fact has pretty much disappeared and most people, even avid fans aren't aware. I just happened to buy a first issue release, the only one in town. I loved it so much I bought one for my girlfriend a year later. I was shocked by what are in some places, drastic changes. Very briefly on one of the old Warner/Reprise 2 dollar 2 record samplers, there is a line about Neil not liking his vocals on his first record and insisting on remixing them.  Don't know what you can do to hear it, even my copy got worn a good bit, so my attempts to digitize result in emphasize the surface noise, but I wouldn't sell it for any amount.   So now you know. That said this is still a great album in any mix. Coupled now with the new Sugar Mountain live set, done to prepare for the release of this album, it illuminates a period of prolific and top of his game Young.
B001O8D47S|5.0|First things first, this movie is NOT for straight men.   Ladies don't force your men to watch this movie!  Now as far as women and gay men?

This allows the movie to truly  Focus on the relationships and strengths of these  Powerful women and finding your strength within!

B00065MDS6|5.0|...goes  Peter  Sinfield's  lyric in the  title cut.  When \\"Lizard\\" was released it was a stunning departure from King Crimson's previous two albums. Mixing jazz-fusion with a medieval sound, it gave progressive rock a boost in its alumni. When I decided to 'catch up' on KC CD's \\"Lizard\\" had to be included in its entirety. Many a night I sat up listening to the intense strains of this album, a complex intertwining of numerous instruments and chaotic notes. This is for the jazz-classical enthusiasts out there. My 2004 release was remastered in 1999 and is a HDCD disc.

It didn't get there on time and I had not Christmas gift to give.  It was on my doorstep when I arrived home Dec. 27, but it was too late to give as a gift.  Inexcusable!
B001EN71DG|5.0|Nice, I would recommend this to those who have never seen the movies before.  Just purchased and watched the movies for the first time ever and I am very pleased. Needless to say I will probably watch them many  times over. Now i guess its time to watch the modern Prequel Trilogy and hopefully I will be just as pleased. Think George can add another vic. to his fan club......
0399534601|3.0|Let me preface this, by saying I love Keri Smith.  I do.  However, to me, this book fell short on so many levels.  There is a lot of space to the book with few words to really sink your teeth into.  If you are like me and LOVED her \\"Wreck This Journal\\", I think you will be a little disappointed, because I was expecting the same type of book with a new twist, maybe??  This isn't that book.  Now, I don't want to ruin it for other fans of Keri Smith.  Maybe you WILL enjoy this book, but if you haven't tried \\"Wreck This Journal\\", I would definitely recommend that book over this one.

0143039601|3.0|The plot is about Ray Smith a thirty-something (I presume), unemployed, hippie who is on the road hopping trains to find his inner Buddha. Eventually, he winds up in California and meets up with Japhy Ryder who he imitates to a T, letting you know full-well that Ray Smith has no mind of his own. They meet other Buddhists, drink wine, talk about Buddhist stuff like the Diamond Sutra, Bhoddisatvas and Bhikkhus, past Buddhas, and they write a lot of haiku poems. All the while, the narrator is constantly bombarding the reader with his strange Buddhist revelations he comes to while praying like \\"everything is empty but awake\\", or \\"rocks are space and space is illusion\\". It gets old fast.    Ray Smith reminds me of a less-cool Dude from \\"The Big Lebowski\\".    You won't find any fascinating stories that Sal Paradise (\\"On the Road\\") had of meeting new people wherever he went, jazz clubs and drinking too much, the drugs, the sexual encounters of the women he entertained... nothing.

0312383320|1.0|I was so excited that plum spooky was coming out, then to find out it was about 300 pages, bonus.  Most of the inbetween books are 150 pages or so.  So i thought this has to be better.  Well, so far I am wrong, I am only half way thru this book and I am bored...  I love reading about Stephanie and the gang, but this one is actually putting me to sleep at night.  Usually I can read 200-300 pages a night.  It is my relaxing time after I put both my kids to bed (both under 3).  But the last two nights I fell asleep reading this book.  To one point I want to give up, but then I think I'm half way done.  I am just glad I did not buy this from the store, I got it from my library.      I hope Janet sees these reviews, because I want the old Plum books back.  I reread 1-10 at least 3 times.  I love those books, but lately it just seems like she is just writing to make a buck.
032147404X|3.0|Even though I knew what was coming from reading other reviews, I was still annoyed and put off by the childish game playing of Kelby's \\"jokes\\". Once? OK. Even twice. Fine. But it is a theme and to be honest, distracting and immature. Even to the point of making you angry that you are paying him for such lameness. That being said, there were many helpful things to me in the book. You just have to sort through the blather.    Here's a suggestion Scott. Can the pranks or else get a much better sense of humor.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is an excellent movie, even though its more than just a few years old now. All the different versions (four) and as well as a workprint is included on the discs. Im not really sure about how many hours of documentary footage is contained, but I have seen about 4,5 hours so far and there is still more.    I knew before watching this that making a movie is really complicated and now I got even a further study into that. The various film versions and deleted scenes puts me in the directiors sitiuation on how to choose what should have been included or not. Yes, yes, of course my own choice would probably differ a tiny bit from the five versions Ive seen - still its a great movie.    Extra thanks to Ridley Scott, amazing how many good movies he made so far.    (note: there was a technical problem with the 1st disc, called final cut, but Amazon solved that in a really professional manner and sent me a new disc really quick)

B001EZ78T6|5.0|(warning: i'm not an english spoken person (French) so excuse my errors)<br /><br />I am a great fan of John Legend, but I will try hard to be objective in this review!! With the Cd comes a DVD where JL explain very well how he made this album, that is he wanted to make something so he could hear himself in clubs! So Greenlights, It's over, Quickly, Cross the line, and the great Satisfaction are not what i would call John legend-ish, but it sounds great, very well done! More JL-ish are This time (his favorite!), Good morning (I loooove this song!), Take me away and I love you love. Very beautiful songs. Special mention to No other love with Estelle, reggae style. (you can ear another joint witn JL on Estelle's Shine, named You are).<br />There is just one song that i think is 'too much' : If You're Out There. Gospel-ish. The song is not JL worthy, but the lyrics are great.<br />So to conclude, Evolver is a great album, very different from the two precedents but very interesting, high quality. My favorites : Satisfaction, Good morning, It's over, Every body knows, This time...Ok, i love it!! :-)

0061537934|4.0|I found \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" to be a great, fun read. Enzo is a better narrator than many human protagonists in other books, and his insights into life can be both humorous and deep. There were times when I forgot that it was a dog narrating the story b/c Enzo doesn't act like your typical mutt at all, but then there are some instances where he acts like any other dopey dog (albeit, one that reflects on his actions afterward).     The human characters are mixed bags. They aren't as well rounded as the canine narrator. I did, however, end up caring for Denny's plight and enjoyed his character a lot. The plot of this book is mainly focused on the difficult situations that pop up in his life and how he copes with them (w/ Enzo narrating of course). I wish there had been more regarding the in laws/grandparents, since they were kind of flat, yet had potential to be very intriguing, 3-D characters    Unfortunately, this book did have a major \\"deus ex machina\\" that kept me from truly enjoying the book to the end, along w/ some plot points that just either weren't explained fully or just didn't make sense.    Overall, I enjoyed the book b/c I loved the character of Enzo. It's a good read w/ many sad moments mixed, but w/ plenty of fun, uplifting moments to balance it out.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|This album was well worth the wait. David Cook has a sound thats all his own and you can hear it well in this album. All the tracks are very well done and his voice proves that their are some artists out there who can actually sing instead of counting on instrumentals to cover the lack of a singing voice.    I predict only good things for Mr. Cook in the future.

B000ZN802W|4.0|What I know or care about the life of McCandless is utterly contingent on Penn's movie. Thus, however close a physical resemblance Emile Hersch has to the 'real' guy, we have an endearing, gritty, open, call it naive,guy, on a journey of self-discovery. He acted like a teener, so I was surpised to find he was 23. I willed the spirited adventurer on in the hope that his quest for 'Truth', over love and its attending virtues, would help him survive his 100 days in the wilderness. The previous two years on the road have been a full on exposure to life beyond the suburbs and family. It's not the film's province to investigate the motives for his radical disavowal of capitalist 'trappings', sustaining friendships, and rebuttal of his family(who don't seem more messed up than most. Eddie Vedder's emotive baritone fits well, echoing our heroe's moves with subtle understatment: some of the best work I've heard from him. It seems only a short distance into the wild before he encounters the body of an abandoned bus which, providentially, provides the shelter which will finally entomb him. It's not the kind of 'wild' protection I'd anticipated. Didn't he have a tent? Whatever, as the food stocks dwindle and the belt draws tighter, his ignorance of any smattering of bush knowledge is painfully evident. Guilt over wasting a moose. Get over it. You eat cooked,flyblown meat when desperate. At least some of it. I've had to. And no attempt to see what fish the river offered. And, oddly, no wondering or wandering along the track the bus must have arrived on. A doomed trajectory. This guy will perish.We're inexorably drawn to the fatal hours, the collapse, the scribbled epitaph, expiration and heavenward gaze. No matter what license the Penn team may have taken with 'fact', the 'truth' of the movie is satisfying, if not for his grieving family. The improbable bear scene, near the last day, was wonderfully eloquent. Wilderness. Yes. Where is it? In the mind? Really! Out there? Yes.

B00004S875|1.0|42nd street music listed the billy joel sacd they sold me as brand new but when it showed up, there was no shrink wrap on it and there were smudges, scratches, stress marks and even finger prints on the cd cover and the cd disc. It was as if they expected me to somehow overlook all those obvious signs and think of it as brand new when it is not.    I was very insulted by them and they refused to refund me for the cd or send me a new one. the cd i ordered is a SACD which was exactly what I wanted but of course without all the marks and scratches that came with it.    buyer beware!!!

3866152779|1.0|...after buying and watching this movie my first thought was how much I'd like to skip it across the freeway.<br />The opening scene IS the entire movie.<br />- You have two loathesome, lifeless, and self-centered people wandering around one of the most exciting places on the planet and seeming to be able to do nothing more than drink and wallow in introspective malaise.<br />Terrible photography, the \\"emulating-a-slightly-drunk-person-with-a-handycam-perspective\\" really gets annoying after a while. I can't say enough bad things about this movie...if you're thinking about watching this, smash yourself in the face with a ballpeen hammer instead, it will be more enjoyable.
0956010903|5.0|I got this book for my wife and I have to admit to being impressed with the packaging and attention to detail of the book. This is a great item for a HP fan.
B001H5X7JS|1.0|Robert Downey jr. was the only redeeming factor. That one star is for him. Everything else about this movie was as bad as tom cruise's character and just as \\"classy\\". It was too conflicted - the mixing of gore and Stiller's comedy just seemed like two separate movies that someone spliced together (poorly). Actors playing actors playing other actors... it almost worked.
B00004T1C8|5.0|This is a great little tunnel addition to any wooden train set.  The sounds are cute although there is no volume control.  It came really fast too.  I wanted it for Christmas and the projected arrival time was January, but I got it in about 5-7 days to an APO military address.  My boys are really happy with it as am I.

0446677450|4.0|Here's what no one else has picked up on. The author tells you a number of stories and learning lessons from his early childhood, He remembers the experiences WORD FOR WORD. Now I don't know about you, but I certainly do not remember conversations \\"word for word\\" from when I was 9 yrs old, especially about investing. I think the author wanted to teach readers about money & investing in such a way that a child could understand.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|I loved this CD of David Cook.  It was nice to hear his voice again on something other than the American Idol song.  I'm looking forward to his next release and also hoping the he puts out more ballads on his next CD so I can enjoy his voice without all of the over production that some of these songs seem to have.

B0002OXVDW|5.0|I bought That's Entertainment I and II, the albums (vinyl of course!), when I was a child and later saw the movies (I never saw III). Watching the films again brought many memories back and also it's just a must for any fans of musicals. First of all the commentary by so may stars that sadly are no longer with us, they give you an insight into the MGM studios at the golden age of cinema. You get to see numbers from movies that are impossible to find. With this collection you have a complete history of the MGM musicals plus rarities that you've probably never seen. 100% classics!
B0000640S1|5.0|This is a truly unique movie that quickly became obscured due to the later sequels. It tells the story of a man who survived one hell, only to return home despised and forsaken because of it. There was a time when America didn't quite know what to think of the lost war, and so it was forgotten - and the men who came out of it as well. Rambo finds he cannot survive this war, because it is still going on within him.    Finally, pushed too far by a small town sheriff, Rambo returns to the only thing he can relate to. War. Yet it is a war he almost mercifully wages on the macho egotistical deputies and week end warriors that pursue. To potentially misquote Rambo :    \\"I coulda killed them all, I could have killed you. In town you're the law, out here it's me. Let it go...\\"
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a must have for your movie collection. More than just an exciting war movie (series) it is a powerful, painful, and moving tribute to the men of the \\"greatest generation\\" and a reminder of the sacrifice of all those Americans who serve and have served throughout the generations.

0064471047|4.0|Ok so I'm one of those people that saw the movie first.  I've tried to read this book 2 times now.  Although short, I just had trouble staying interested in it.  I thought the movie was excellent.  Normally the books are better than the movie, but in my case I don't think so.  I know it's a children's book but it reads very childish to me.  This is the main reason I just couldn't stick with it.<br /><br />My reason for 4 stars and not less, it was a great movie and it takes a great book to make a great movie.  I'd suggest this to all readers, it's fast and was fairly easy to read.  But don't watch the movie first.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I planned on doing this workout everyday and started on a Monday.  Well... I was so sore from it(barely could walk up my stairs, hurt to get up from a sitting position) I started back on it on Saturday.  I didn't think I would like working out with a DVD but I reall enjoy it and it goes by really fast!
B000BB1MIC|5.0|My 15 year old daughter told me this was the perfect present. The item was new, affordable, and timely.  Thanks
B00000F169|4.0|I first saw this while in college in the 70s. I have remembered it since. Its view of people and their foibles in an absurd situation makes me think of Catch 22. The beach ball alien is classic! I suspect the bomb is smarter than some of the people at my office. A gem of a low budget, USC grad school movie made by people destined for success in the industry.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|The DVD version of Dr. Horrible is certainly worth its $10 price tag (cheaper than the soundtrack).  The Acts are all stitched together, making the viewing more seamless than before.  \\"Commentary: The Musical!\\" was a fun bonus, even if it only gave a token effort to actually being a commentary.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|one of the best releases ever from Jeff Beck. Live @ Ronnie Scott's showcases his ability to cover rock, jazz, and fusion seamlessly. Every note and riff that Jeff Beck plays are with purpose & finesse'. on display is a crackerjack band, including the amazing Vinnie Coliuita on drums, and young Tai Wilkerson on bass.    from his 1st release in the 60's \\"Truth\\" , comes a majestic version of Beck's Bolero. every note played with a slide and each  use of the whammy bar done purposefully.  His cover of  Beatles  \\"A day in the life\\" is so stellar that this instrumental version  finds one not missing the singing  in the slightest.  An awesome \\"big block\\" almost exceeds the original studio cut from \\"Guitar Shop\\"     A true gem of a CD, Performing this week live@ Ronnie Scott's should be rated one of the top 5 releases for 2008.

0743270754|5.0|Excellent book.  Reading the book was similar to watching a documentary on the inner workings of the Lincoln cabinet.  Best take away from the book - 'With malice toward none; with charity for all'.  What an excellent sentiment by a great man.
140120841X|5.0|V for Vendetta was written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd and was published in the early 1980's to the mid 1980's.<br /> Moore sets the scene of V's escapades from the 1980's through the late 1990's.  As a tradition with Mr. Moore, he brings on a sinister and dark plot of a time and place set in late 20th Century Britain.<br /> The setting is a Britain which has survived a nuclear exchange between the USA and Russia and has formed a new government.  Indeed this government takes on a fascist being and rather resembles the England created by George Orwell in 1984.  Big Brother is more sophisticated than Orwell's version.  In fact if I didn't know any better I would say this is a modernized illustration version of 1984.<br /> The plot revolves around the masked vigilante name V, who has a vendetta with the leaders of this new fascist government.  His friendship with a young woman named Evey forms a partnership which will wreck havoc on Fascist Old England.  The story goes into a relentless continuation of attacks throughout London in V's retribution for his perceived injustices.<br /> Along the way we see many of the endeared landmarks of London disappear including Rumpole's beloved \\"Old Bailey\\".  Perish the thought!!<br /> As usual Mr. Moore creates a dark story in a dark time, much like George Orwell did 40 years before situated in jolly old England.<br /> However, as always with Moore this graphic novel does give food for thought as did George Orwell'S 1984. Five Stars!  Good Read!!
0767803434|5.0|[[ASIN:0767803434 Air Force One]]  I ordered this for my  grandson as I could not locate it anywhere in the stores.  I was so pleased to find it on Amazon, and at a reasonable price.  This was the gift my grandson really wanted and it was easy to make him happy by ordering through here.
B00005JM0B|3.0|In short, it was entertaining but the actors (besides Arnold) did a poor job compared to the acting done in the first or second.  I thought the first movie was much more ominous, suspenseful, and frightening, too.  Terminator 3 suffers from Hollywood's obsessive desire to turn what could be a great thriller into a romantic, expensive, and vacuous action movie.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I've read all the books and now I've seen the show. I have to say, though I may be one of the few, I prefer the show. For me, Paquin's Sookie is MUCH more likable than the Sookie in Harris' books. Paquin plays \\"Crazy Sookie\\" very well, and shows a lot of emotional vulnerability that makes her character believable, which I've never noticed in my several readings of the books. In the books, though, she's just crazy and ignores a lot of good advice, and is very self-involved, never thinking about other people having reasons for doing the things they do.    Maybe my favorite change from the books to the series is that it's not all about Sookie. Other characters also get attention, and their own storylines, which makes the show that much more interesting to watch. On top of that, Stephen Moyer is an INCREDIBLE Bill with very real issues that show up in his personality. I look forward to dealing with the issues Bill has that were set up in the last episode of season 1 when the show comes back for season 2.    I can't wait to continue watching this show next season. I'm sure it will be great! And as for the books, I do agree that reading them is a good thing, but I completely prefer Harris' other book series over the Stackhouse series. For me, that series is bland, and underwritten, especially compared to her Aurora Teagarden series.
B001NAZPYM|5.0|Is there a more powerful chord in rock history than that of the power chord strung by Townshend as Daltrey screams \\"YEEEEEAHHHHH!\\" in \\"Won't Get Fooled Again?\\"    I am hard pressed to find a classic rock album I enjoy more than this one.  Every song is great; some of the greatest rock songs ever written dot this album.    The hard-rocking power of \\"Baba O'Reilly,\\" \\"Bargain\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" are metered with the mellow \\"Getting in Tune\\" and Love Ain't For Keeping.\\"    \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" similar to \\"Over the Hills and Far Away,\\" masterfully combines a beautiful soft melody with a hard rocking second-half.    This is one of the greatest bands ever at their peak.  Anyone who considers themselves a classic rock fan, MUST have this album in their collection.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I saw this movie last night and I'm still processing it.    The least you can say about it is that it is art. It will leave you thinking about it the next day and it will make you feel something. It might not be something that you like but it will be something. This puts it above 85% of the crap churned out by hollywood.  Although it's a very different type of movie, the closest I can come to comparing it would be \\"American Beauty\\". It is visual, paced, stylized and much of what is says is not in the dialog. Also, the climax is sad and horrifying yet, by the time you get there, you can see it from a perspective where it is beautiful.  Like other reviewers, I find myself hoping that hollywood doesn't screw it up. I want more so I'm going out today and buy the book.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Great movie. My family watches all the time over and over and it seems like the kids can't get enough of it!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is a great show! You just can't lose with Neil Patrick Harris, Joss Whedon, and the rest of this stellar comic cast.  I love this show so much! I pre-ordered it when I found out it was on Amazon. Got it in time for Christmas!  If you are a fan of Neil Patrick Harris, Joss, or Firefly/Serenity, then this show is a must see!<br /><br />There are also some amusing special features.
B00005JNJV|4.0|1st. The Product Came On Time.<br /><br />2nd.I Saw A Portion Of This Film Over At A Freind Of Mines House.<br />I Asked Him To Play It Over Again (Restart It).<br /><br /> The Other People That Were Watching Didn't Seem That Enthused At The Idea Starting It Over From The Begining, So They Told Me About It Instead & That Was That As Far As Getting The Flick Restarted.<br /><br />3rd. Upon Getting It In My House, I Sat Down & Was Instanly Entertained. I Saw The Whole Movie Finally...
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is another great movie from Pixar. It stands up to repeated veiwings (I should know, b/c my 3 year old loves to watch it over and over).  Special features are solid.  Very funny movie. Probably some in-jokes aimed at the sci-fi crowd. I got them as I am an avid sci-fi fan.<br /><br />Overall- Your kids should love it, you should at least like it, and I think the recycled packaging is a nice touch to the message in the movie.
B0017APPT8|4.0|I had heard this film but I had no chance to watch this film entirly. This BD brought me the exciting experience of Audio and Video. Especially, the scenario of this film is funny and relaxed.

015206396X|5.0|I loved it! Yes, It is time there is a girl that is in control of her self and what she is to do with herself. I am glad that Lady Katsa has taken control of her future. I think it is a great read for all girls young(not to young) and old to read. I didn't even have an idea about the book or heard anything about it. I just saw it one day at a book store and bought it without knowing the contents. I am glad I did. I couldn't put it down. I think I read it in 4 days. I laughed, cheered, cried, laughed some more, and cried some more. Truely worth buying. I hope there are more to come of Katsa & Prince Po's lives for us to read in the near future. If anyone knows if there is to be a sequel please post it so I will know.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I had bought this album for my wife and she is a great fan of Enya.

0321525655|5.0|I run sales for a software company and write a blog on how to sell better in a virtual world now that the environment, travel costs and budget cuts have drastically reduced the amount of time that sales people can spend with customers and prospects [...] .  Subsequently, I have spent a lot of time optimizing presentations for webinars and this book has helped a lot.  It is my theory that in a virtual environment, you need to use video, photos and graphics to bring out your passion and commitment to what you are presenting.  You need to reduce the amount of text you use so that people aren't just reading ahead. This book is a manual that will walk you through all that you need to do.  Definitely recommend.
B001CZVVVY|4.0|Harnoncourt and this cast are wonderfully magnificent. But the staging is better described as anti-staging. A wonderful surprise, to me, was the stunningly clear DTS-HD sound on the blu-ray disc. Well worth the price even with the visual left out!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The programme is totally amazing-----the amt. of work that puts into this series is unbelivable! It's an eye opener  to see those never been filmed images, and the narrative is superb.  Totally enjoyable and hypnotic ,and with Blu-ray it is a whole new experience!
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|We saw the play in London and enjoyed it but the movie has the beautiful scenery which adds a lot visually.  The cast did an excellent job including the singing.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I originally bought this product through Target but found it being offered through Amazon a day later for a cheaper price so I placed my order through Amazon and decided I'd return the one I bought through Target.  I have to say my son whom the dvd set was purchased watched the series within the first weekend he'd received it and again and again.    So you can say he's a satisfied customer and I am happy I was able to save $20 and receive it in 2 days.  Thanks, Amazon
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|I have seen all the Batman movies - the only joker I had to go by was Jack Nicholson. As much as I want to give credit to the rest of the cast in this movie, Health Ledger stole the movie, period. Showing a different side of Joker that Nicholson didnt give, Health deserves the Supporting Actor nod. While its sad this movie will forever have \\"Health's last complete movie\\" stamped on it, the rest of the cast - Bale,Gyllenhall,Eckhart,Caine,Freeman,Oldman - give this movie a well-rounded cast & possibly the best Batman movie cast ever.Hopefully they follow through with a sequel!

B000PC6A3E|5.0|It's rare you find such a treat in the theatres these days. Disappointing acting, unoriginal stories, and recycled plots create a crapfest of bad movies. However, The Dark Knight shows us we don't need to be this way. Heath Ledger, rest his soul, was truly at the top of his game and all the choices were excellent actors. The story line, while obviously somewhat recycled (forgivably so), is as original as its going to get, and the whole movie is carried off without much in the way of flaw. Granted, you can pick things out that are \\"wrong\\" but all within the realm of suspension of disbelief.    In any case, the movie is worth owning just for Ledger's performance!
B001O8D47S|4.0|\\"The Women\\" for women.  Though the movie is simple, the characters are interesting and unique.  The movie is full of reminders that whoever we are and whatever we have that life is not perfect.  It also reminds us that regardless of what life brings, we are responsible for our own peace and happiness by being true to ourselves.  A movie that you can watch over and over, not because of the great story but because of how it makes you feel.
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|This show is amazing, a must watch.  The show keeps getting better and better, this was an amazing season 4. The build up for the last two seasons is just amazing I am in awe!!    A must watch!!
076792603X|5.0|I was told that it most likely will not get here before Dec 24th (even though I ordered it about a week before), so I was prepared to receive it much after Christmas. Then on the 19th, it came! Nice.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until a couple months ago, and now it is my new favorite of all time.  The scenes are stunningly beautiful, the story is touching, and we went from crying to laughing out loud at several points.  Lee Pace is wonderful and his little co-star, enchanting.  It is one to watch again and again, just to hear lines maybe not heard the first time through.      I would recommend for parents to watch this before having their kids watch, mostly because of the leaps of imagination and plays on words in the story.  Parents would know best if their kids could follow it.  There is a lot to take in, so the ability to follow is crucial to its enjoyment.      We bought it for all of our kids to have in their homes- a wonderful story to enjoy again and again.
B00011F5DK|4.0|We purchased this after hearing how much fun it was.  It is true, but highly recommend keeping an even number of players.  The odd number of player rules are a bit of a pain.

031606792X|1.0|The real horror of the Twilight series lies in the fact that these books have been recommended for middle-schoolers. Bella has no interests outside of her obsessive love for Edward, she constantly denigrates herself, both young lovers are firmly committed to the idea of suicide for the survivor should should something happen to one of them, and the tedious subplot in re: werewolves (or trickster wolves) is, quite simply, a howler.
B00005JOA0|3.0|In a lot of these 19th century romantic novels they talk about out on the moores (as a symbol desolation?). Here I got to see that in the movie.<br />The plight of women and underage children in 19th century England<br />was bad in terms of common laws rights. A bad or abusive marriage can ruin a woman's life when she can't legally escape the more powerful husband.<br />Escape means living under another name and hiding.<br />The husband  has no conscience and has no guilt as he kidnaps her son.<br />Forced to live with her attractive beast of an husband, in the end love triumphs beyond all odds.
0894803123|1.0|I love Ben and Jerry's ice cream but am very disappointed in this book. It includes a basic recipe mix that calls for egg but doesn't call for cooking the mix. Raw eggs always represent a potential health problem and freezing doesn't make eggs safe. Any ice cream recipe that includes egg should specify either using pasturized eggs or cooking the mixture and then cooling it completely before churning. Beyond the basic mix recipes, this book is mostly about crushing various things, like cookies and candy, to add to the basic recipe. I don't need a book for this.
B0017CW5J4|5.0|I saw the Blue Man Group live in Boston several years ago, and have been a fan since they first started getting noticed.  Their anti-style drew me in, their messages tickled me, their visuals enthralled me, but their music kept me.<br /><br />So you can imagine my joy a couple years ago when I saw that HDnet was going to show this concert in HiDef.  I blocked out the time on that Sunday, turned on my cable, and was prepared to be enthralled.<br /><br />I was horribly disappointed.  I literally called my cable provider and complained.<br /><br />The problem was not with the content, but rather with the highly compressed delivery system.  The strobes and fire in \\"One of These Days\\", the rapid motion of the drum sticks and whips in \\"Shadows Part 2\\", the paint drums in \\"Your Attention\\", the confetti and full-stage views in \\"Baba O'Riley\\", all pushed way past the limits of any kind of a cable TV, satellite delivery, or HD video download service.  Macroblocking in the rapid strobe scenes and the paint drops (which wound up looking like large squares rather than droplets) made the video look like an early VHS tape rather than a 2 megapixel, 21st century, HiDef recording.<br /><br />So, I've been just as eagerly anticipating this Blu-Ray release.  And this time, I've not been disappointed.  With data rates regularly exceeding 35Mbps in the high motion scenes, peaking at over 49Mbps for some of the most complex transitions in the climax of \\"Baba O'Riley\\", this disc exemplifies \\"why Blu-Ray\\".<br /><br />Those who claim that HD downloads will replace physical media may be right someday, but that day is not here yet, it will not be here any time soon, and this disc shows why.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray was superbly crafted, with the quality of audio and video paramount.  It's a worthy addition to your collection, and when a friend wants to see how well Blu-Ray can handle difficult material, pull this one out.  If you're (un)lucky enough to have HDnet Sunday Concerts showing this concert on cable or satellite at the same time, you'll easily be able to see what I'm talking about, and convincingly demonstrate it.<br /><br />If you like Blue Man Group and don't yet have a Hi Def display and Blu-Ray player, this is a great reason to finally make the jump.<br /><br />Kudos to HDnet for recording this, and props to Blink Digital for the superb Blu-Ray production!ou'll easily be able to see what I'm talking about, and convincingly demonstrate it.

I highly recommend it, ive been listening to it almost non stop for a month now, its just that good.  Yes its a tad short, but what the hey, its definitely some great Alan Parsons work with all the great original members of the band throwing in their voice work!  Dig it, APP definitely some of the all time great stuff (im a diverse music listener too)...

B000UBMSB8|5.0|Yes, it's been tough finding a copy of Blade Runner that has the narration. Which is the only reason I bought this set. But, at least I did wait until it was on sale. I realize Ridley Scott claims the newest version is what he really intended, but I'll take the side of the studio on this one. Blade is a very dark, slow moving movie. I find the narration to be helpful in moving the story along, and important in giving insights into what Decker was thinking at any given moment. I was very surprised Scott didn't like or endorse it. Then, after sitting through this dark slow film, I think we deserve a happy ending. After all, aren't all fairy tales supposed to have happy endings and what's wrong with that? The Decker character certainly deserved it, didn't he? We did...<br /><br />I think a lot of times, directors get a little full of themselves from past successes (ie. Aliens) and forget the focus of a film is for people to actually want to go see it. All these many, many versions of this film, to me, only amount to milking the cow for all it's worth, not from any deeper insight. I believe the changes the studio demanded were right on the money and as a result, we're all here having this discussion. I don't believe Ridley's newest version would have resulted in the cult hit Blade Runner was to become. Studios know what sells, directors don't neccesarily. See Gene Roddenbury and Star Trek 1, vs. 2, The Wrath of Khan. The first was Gene's and the second was the studios. While I like Star Trek the Motion Picture, there absolutely No comparison to The Wrath of Khan.<br /><br />Back to Blade; the International version is very nice. While the sound is spot on excellent, the video transfer isn't near as good as I would have liked to have seen however. It almost looks like a dubbed video tape actually. Much like they stuck it in this set because they had to give you as many disks as they could for the high price they were asking. If you use zoom 1 to get rid of the black bars, it's readily apparent how lacking the transfer is. But, it's not bad and well worth the buy if you're a fan; especially if you don't like the direction Ridley Scott took the movie.parent how lacking the transfer is.

0316010669|2.0|I felt this book came as a highly rated \\"Bestseller\\" but I find I am disappointed.  While I haven't completely finished the book yet it seems to contain several very long descriptive stories of how people behave according to their preconceived ideas.

B0015I2P0Y|4.0|The UK indie-band Elbow has been making waves for many years, but mostly under the radar screen and far away from the mainstream. Even though the band has been playing together for a a good 15 years, this is Elbow's fourth album only, but what a beauty it is.<br /><br />On \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" (11 tracks; 55 min.), the band continues to brings its rich soundscapes. Opening track \\"Starlings\\" starts off with a long instrumental intro, eventually leading to the opening line from lead singer Guy Garvey \\"How dare the premier ignore my invitation\\", haha! (And it just struck me again me how much Garvey's voice reminds me of Peter Gabriel's, and that's a compliment. \\"Grounds for Divorce\\" is the hardest-charging song on the album, but it works quite well. \\"The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver\\" is a more typical representation of the album: lush, pensive, mesmerizing, just beautiful. \\"The Fix Is In\\" (with a guest appearance from Richard Hawley) is for me the odd track out on the album, it just doesn't work. Next-to-last track \\"One Day Like This\\", on the other hand, is another delightful highlight on this album, with a full orchestral touch to it.<br /><br />In all, this is a delightful album from start to finish. This album won the prestigious 2008 Mercury Prize in the UK, and brought unexpected but much deserved acclaim to the band, which is now an overnight success that has been 15 years in the making. If you wonder where you might here these guys, check out internet-only station WOXY (\\"BAM! The future of rock and roll\\"), which brings the best indie-music in this country, bar none. I have never seen these guys live, but sure hope that I will have a chance to do so in 2009. Meanwhile \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I could watch this series again & again. The photography is outstanding. Every time I watch I see new things I did not notice the first time. This is a must for any DVD library. Excellent for all ages, young & not so young. Takes you to places you will never get a chance to see.
B001ECQ75A|3.0|This is a visually striking animated film. It is beautifully colored, beautifully drawn, and has an appealing enough schnook of a hero.     However we hardly get to know many of the key characters, such as the members of the \\"Furious Five.\\" Most of them are given only a few lines to establish their personalities. The similarity between two of the opposing characters might also create some confusion among young viewers. There's Tigress, one of the heroic Furious Five. Then there's Tai Lung, also a fierce-looking feline - who is the arch villain impressively voiced by Ian McShane. A youngster (or an adult) could initially confuse the two.    Then where we might expect some family resemblance, there is none. The Panda's father is inexplicably - a goose. In the Director's Commentary, John Stevenson says that this anomaly is gleefully accepted by children. Well, maybe...    However, the script seems to me to be too random in too many places. Elements needed to further the plot or to bring resolution are often plucked out of the air. I expected the heroes' fighting techniques to ultimately relate somehow to their unique backgrounds and skills. For example, I kept expecting the Panda to execute some winning maneuver culled from his background balancing hot dishes of noodles, serving noodles every day in his father's noodle shop. But that never happens. Whatever fighting techniques the Panda or any of the others employ are strictly ad hoc. They don't relate to anything the characters bring to the combat or to anything they might have learned in their kung fu training with the Master.    This is in contrast with the scripting of another recent acclaimed action animation film, \\"The Incredibles.\\" In fighting their adversaries, the ploys used by the Incredibles arise organically from who they are, from powers that were initially established for them and that they honed or remembered in the course of the action.    So younger children might be happy with the general look and appeal of \\"Kung Fu Panda.\\" But for somewhat older children who demand a more coherent storyline, more consistent characterization, and some imparted wisdoms that they can actually apply in winning their battles in life, I suggest a film such as \\"The Incredibles.\\"
B001GQACGE|4.0|I purchased this DVD in November, and this DVD is just wonderful.  Beyonce' is just wonderful and I love this DVD.
B001O6W9QC|2.0|I thought with the cast of this film that it would be much better than it actually was.  Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but close.<br /><br />Just spend your money on a sharp stick and poke yourself in the eye, you'll have more fun than watching this.
B00168HARG|5.0|I watched season 1 on FOX in Standard Definition.  I have DIRECTV with the East and West coast feeds so I don't get the networks in HD.  Since I like this show so much and just got a PS3 I figured this would make a good purchase to watch in Blu Ray.  The show is so well written, directed, and acted.  There is quite a bit of action and I can't wait to watch it now in HD, I bet it makes a big difference.  I can tell you for a fact that Blu Ray is great, picture quality and sound far surpass normal standard defination and I can see how the Blu Ray beat HDDVD because the Blu Ray can hold so much more information on it then the HDDVD and I do have both format systems.  If you love the Terminator movies I think you will really enjoy this show.
B001J1O848|3.0|[[ASIN:B001J1O848 Taken]] is a new movie starring Liam Neeson as a former security specialist who has relegated himself to the civilian sector to be closer to his daughter.  When a simple trip abroad puts his daughter and her friend in danger, he must swing back into action.  Visually, the movie is very well shot and will be a pleasure to watch in standard definition or Blu-Ray.  But the weak story holds back a movie that could have been much better.<br /><br />This film deals with kidnapping and human trafficking, very serious problems which have become overused in films of recent memory.  This film is entertaining as an action movie, though somewhat predictable.  But as a movie about human trafficking, the script is filled with numerous holes and inaccuracies that make it less than believable.  The less you know about the topic, the easier it will be for you to suspend disbelief and enjoy this as surface level entertainment.<br /><br />As Bryan Mills, Neeson attempts to channel a composite of Matt Damon's character from the [[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity]] with Denzel Washington's character from [[ASIN:B00005JN0W Man on Fire]].<br /><br />Bourne's odyssey and skills are easier to believe because of the economy of dialogue and the way the back-story is slowly fed to us.  In addition, the script of the [[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity]] was clearly well vetted and researched.  Here, Neeson's character says and does things that no trained security professional would ever do, like warning the villains that he is a trained security professional and that he is coming for them.  He is clearly no Bourne.<br /><br />In comparison with Denzel Washington's character, Neeson is not given nearly as much to work with in terms of emotion and dimension.  Denzel was given a character we could relate to through his human frailty.  But Neeson is given a wooden role with one-dimensional motivation.  One can even think to Russel Crowe's role in [[ASIN:B00005BCKF Proof of Life]] as another point of comparison.  It's easy to see how little Neeson is given to work with here.<br /><br />The supporting cast is good, and includes Famke Janssen as Neeson's ex-wife.  However, there is a rather lengthy back-story that attempts to develop Neeson's character.  We get to meet his former security buddies and get to see how he interacts with his ex-wife and how much he sacrifices for his daughter.  By the time we get to the heart of the film, it's clear that much of that back-story could have been told in half the time to better effect.<br /><br />About half of the early cast could have been cut.  Similarly there are a lot of supporting scenes that could have been trimmed to maintain the suspense at a higher level.  The result is a movie with choppy pacing that drags on and feels longer than it is.<br /><br />The irony of that is that there is already an extended \\"harder\\" cut set to be released on Blu-Ray.  I will suspend disbelief till I see the extended version, but it's difficult for me to imagine making this movie better by adding scenes.  It seems like much of what was included could have made this movie better by being pared away.<br /><br />**** MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD -- STOP NOW TO AVOID ****<br /><br />As with any action movie, there are a number of fight scenes where Neeson seems to gain super-human dexterity, unlimited strength and omnipresent knowledge of all of his enemies.  Believe it or not, I can somewhat accept his ability to defeat any number of opponents as an action movie standard.  The fight choreography is actually very good as a whole.<br /><br />However, it gets worse. The numerous errors in the supporting sequences make it difficult to suspend disbelief.  With almost no information, he is able to ID his adversaries from some imaginary database that could only exist in the mind of a Hollywood producer and would never work in practice.  It's hard to believe that Neeson goes to Paris, after having been retired from overseas duty for several years, and somehow all his contacts are still there in roughly the same roles ready to provide him lodging and resources.<br /><br />Of course, everybody in Paris speaks English to him with pleasure.  Did any of the writers actually go to Paris for research before this movie?  It's difficult to accept that he could wander into a crime den masquerading as a French security agent while speaking English.  Then again, considering the same people he confronts have already gotten a visual ID on him, it's absurd that he isn't immediately shot.<br /><br />But then, to insult our intelligence even further, once we get to the climax scene and witness the people actually engaging in the human trafficking, we are shown a scenario that makes [[ASIN:B000UNYK3A Hostel]] seem plausible.  I don't want to give too much away.  But if you do get to see it ask yourself, \\"would people breaking the law do so in this way?\\"<br /><br />Once again, if you can suspend disbelief some of those many things will not bother you as much.  But this is just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This movie is OK, hence my average rating.  It's a good way to pass the time, and those who love foreign thrillers and action movies will enjoy the fight scenes and top notch camera work.  But the predictable plot and factual errors undercut what could have been a much better movie.  Neeson is a very good actor, but he can't make up for a script that needed to be vetted by several fact checkers before the final cut.<br /><br />Judging by the enthusiastic foreign response to this movie, I can only hope that a completely separate cut was release for the European market.<br /><br />This is worth seeing for mindless entertainment, but if you're expecting something as good as [[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity]] you will likely be disappointed.<br /><br />Enjoy.ere in roughly the same roles ready to provide him lodging and resources.

B0018RWMNM|5.0|My friend and roommate at the time in 1994 kept wanting me to watch this show called Lonesome Dove.  The title just didn't interest me and I had no idea what it was about.  After a couple weeks I gave in and we rented the VHS.  When I started watching this show I was suprised it was a Western, as I love Westerns.  This show was so well written and acted that I was immediately hooked and had to watch the rest of the Lonesome Dove Series.  I own them all but the original is the best.  I own all of them on SD, so I decided I would buy this one on Blu Ray because it's my favorite in the series.  If you love Westerns then I highly recommend you watch this, rent if first to make sure but when you are ready to buy, make sure and buy it here, the price is the lowest I have found on the net.  I highly recommend this Mini-Series.

B001E5FYS8|4.0|Man on Wire was an enthralling documentary that sucked my in from the start.  I am too young to remember the event when it actually happened, but the video made me feel as though I lived through it.  The photography was breathtaking.  Having climbed to the top of Notre Dame and studied the gargoyles, it was mesmorizing to see the photos of him \\"suspended in air\\" next to them.  How he was able to plan and execute his Twin Towers spectacle was fascinating.      I also think this video in a post 9/11 world was, in a way, an inadvertant tribute to the Twin Towers.  It made me sad to watch the footage and think that those towers are no longer there.  It made me mad to think how he was able to plan this complex stunt without being caught by any security at the Towers.  Which brings me to my criticism:  I think it was a glaring omission to not include in this documentary Petit's feelings about the fall of the towers.  This man dreamed of walking between the towers before they even were built - to not include his commentary on their destruction left me wanting more.      Overall, however, this movie mesmorized me and I highly recommend it to everyone!

1416594884|5.0|Moral and financial complexities permeate this novel which carries with it a biting commentary on western foreign policy and particularly that of America.  A follow the money journey through an archipelago of global banks both large and small who are subtly connected to vaguely named charitable organizations.  Here too is the classic spy story, but it carries the more raw and violent edge of the post 9/11 era.  One of the book's main characters; the steely, ruthless and indefatigable German spy chief Gunther Bachman states \\"we are not policemen, we are spies.  We do not arrest our targets. We develop them and redirect them at bigger targets.  When we identify a network, we watch it, we listen to it, we penetrate it and by degrees we control it.  Arrests are of negative value.\\"      And in the shadows there is the suggestion that we \\"shake-down\\" and torture too and this has a decidedly more sinister and edgy feel than the interrogation of Bill Hayden of yesteryear.       The reader gains a comprehension of the chronic paranoia which spawns the evil shadows in the closet sense of things (or not) which, in turn generates the motivation behind the actions of three western spy agencies in this story.  This becomes a study in moral complexity, fear and policy.      Do these agencies and their people become a monster in pursuit of one?  If a person is 95% good and 5% bad does that make them all bad?  Mostly good?  Bachman describes what 5% \\"bad\\" means in the real world when the author paraphrases his thought by saying that the public is protected from having to grapple with the dilemma which he concludes is the \\"slaughterhouse blood washing over your toe caps, and the hundred percent dead scattered in five percent bits over a square kilometer of the town square (presumably from a suicide bomber).\\"   5% bad might lead to 100% dead being the inference.  And so the psychology becomes amplified and finds itself to action and policy.  So accustomed to their paranoia are they that truth becomes obscured.  Maddening.  Bachman wrestles with this dilemma; but the classic LeCarre character Mr. Tommy Brue and the German civil rights lawyer who defends the protagonist do even more so.  Where does this leave us?     Finally the reader is clear that the book's protagonist, Issa, is (or might be) innocent but nonetheless has been sucked into the maelstrom of American lead extraordinary rendition and spying and this leaves the reader hanging.  What is to become of Issa?  We realize that the story might continue in some Egyptian or Syrian torture chamber and that there are many stories just like it and that justice has very well been compromised and perverted OR has it?    This is as close to the \\"old LeCarre\\" as I've seen among his most recent novels.  It harkens back to the moral complexity and haunting questions of the Karla trilogy, or The Spy Who Came in From the Cold or The Night Manager.  It's very good, but it just squeaks into 5 star territory well behind of the aforementioned.     It leaves me wrestling with a lot of important questions which out live the reading of the book.  And that, I suspect, is the point.  It is also what makes it so good and worthy of just getting into the 5 star zone for me.
0956010903|4.0|I think this is an excellent collector item.  I am very happy that it supports such a wonderful charity.  However, I think that the quality of the item was not as good as it could have been.  The metal on the cover wobbles.  The gemstones look really fake.  There are a few typos in the text.  I think that the craftsmanship could have been better for something like this that most of us fans that invested in it plan to keep for generations.  To be fair, other parts are wonderful.  The leather of the outer book is so soft.  The space for the book has padding underneath.  The illustrations in the book are beautiful and the large prints are amazing.  The velvet bag is so luxurious.  I also love the green ribbon that keeps my place as I read and re-read this amazing book.  Those details are definitely worth the price.
B0012GMZA4|2.0|Umm, Huh?  Many of these songs sound WAY different from the old cassette I have of this album -- especially one of my favorite songs by Rory -- Ain't too good -- this version is missing the lyrics from the bridge entirely!!!    NOT what I was expecting when I got this CD.  Look for the original -- much better versions of the songs.
0525478183|5.0|This is one of the those books that you'll read and leave the book feeling so much better. I was laughing out loud as I read some of the passages. The main protagonists are quirky and strong.<br /><br />Where were these books when I was 12? I am definitely going to pass this book on to my eldest daughter, since I think she'll enjoy it.<br /><br />The strength of this book really lies with the ways that the author offers us insights into what the characters are feeling/thinking. It's both realistic and raw. The audience for this book is wide, as I can see adults enjoying this book as much at teens.

Why can no one have a happy, fulfilling relationship in any story? If you've never read any of her work, by all means, this is worth the read, but if you've read the others, you've already read this one. Perhaps Ms. Lahiri needs some Prozac and therapy.

B000002A3T|5.0|Wow! If only I had discovered this album in 1994 when it was released! This is one great album. I realize that Roger Waters was not with Pink Floyd when this was done, but it is what it is, and it is wonderful! There is a definite feeling of isolation and separation (from self or from others) through the tracks, and most people have first-hand experience with those feelings. Listen to it and see what I mean. It will reach in and touch those emotions.<br /><br />Nine of these 11 songs get 4 ½ or 5 stars, which makes this one great album to sit back and enjoy. No matter how great everything is going, if you have ever had any regrets, or simply have ever wondered \\"what might have been,\\" this album will strike a chord. Buy and enjoy.

B000JLQSWE|5.0|If you are in some sort of co-dependent relationship or just ready to break it off with someone and move on with your life, this album will give you the push you may need. I know how it feels - the guilt, the pressure, the head games. When Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson created this album, they unknowingly may have helped many naïve young guys (like myself at the time) make some grown-up decisions that would make a world of difference later in life.<br /><br />The songs on this album are truly inspiring and thought-provoking. This album was released in 1984, two years after their popular album \\"Eye in the Sky.\\" The songs are pop- and radio-friendly, with very catchy tunes and lyrics with real meaning.<br /><br />The album as a whole is a 5-star masterpiece, and the fact that it was so instrumental (pun intended) in helping me to \\"move on,\\" makes it even more so. Bravo to Alan and Eric, and thank you.
B001MW0J2E|5.0|I can't truly say this is album of the year yet. I mean, come on it's only January. Who cares about album of the year anyways? What we are all looking for is really good music and really good music is what this is. All the animal collective records I have are good and I always find a few tracks worthy of repeated listens whenever the record is playing. This however is on a completely different level from anything they've done. It still sounds like them, but it's glossier. Not in a bad way, it just sounds perfect. They have perfected their craft. They have become masters of their art. This will leave a bad taste in some mouths, so I'm expecting a tiny bit of backlash from the uber-hip. I understand some indie rockers like their music full of imperfections and unpredictability and that's fine. Yet this record is absolutely GORGEOUS and if you understand how hard it is to make good music, you'll understand this record's accomplishments. It's unique, catchy, smooth, edgy, melancholy, sublime.... it's got it all. It runs the gamut of emotions and you\\"ll feel good when it's over. Be careful of My Girls. It might be the most addicting song I've heard in 5 years. It's like a gateway song. It strongly pulls you towards this swirling mess of harmony and sound until eventually all the songs have you hooked. Anyways, I need to stop drooling over MPP and go listen to it. It may or may not be record of the year, but it already feels classic.
B001FEO6PK|5.0|This is a great cd. If you are a Jason Becker fan, you should definitely buy it. Jason Becker is such a talented guy and if you know his condition and you are a musician, you will appreciate this cd even more. I think they should have put Concerto among the collection songs but other than that, this is a cd that you have to owe.
1400079179|5.0|There is lot of hype surrounding this book. I do not intend to engage the discussion of if it is factual or historically correct. As far as I know, I bought it in the fiction section, and although, like many other works of fiction, it may draw from real people, places, and history, it recasts them in a fictional account. Whether Mr. Brown thinks these things are true or not is impertinent to this review. I read it as and will treat it like fiction.<br /><br />Now, with this understanding, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was exciting and puzzling, kept a good pace, and was a great idea.  I found it hard to put down.<br /><br />The last man knowing the secret bloodline of Christ is murdered, and in an effort to pass on this information before he dies, leaves clues for his daughter to follow. This takes her and professor Robert Langdon on a wild chase to secure this information.<br /><br />It is a good story and a good adventure. Is it overrated? Yes. But it is still a good read. If you take it for what it is I think you will enjoy it.<br /><br />I recommend it.
B000QFBW6K|5.0|Sorry for such a long review, but Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen is bigger than life.<br /><br />Das Rheingold<br /><br />Don't let the Rheinmaidens' 1980s punk-rock look put you off. Their costume style works well with the yellow-green laser lights that set the stage for the Rhein scenes. To handle the difficult staging of Wotan's and Loge's travel to and from Nibelheim, there are endless industrial-stlye stairways. Likewise, in the closing scene of Rheingold, where Wotan and the other gods enter Valhalla, instead of a rainbow bridge, they use a well-lighted, pyramidal elevator.<br /><br />So with all these unconventional staging surprises, why is this such a great DVD set? The widescreen format and surround sound help us focus on the great singing and acting in this performance.<br /><br />John Tomlinson is a convincing, energetic Wotan. Alberich is sung (and acted!) at his very best by Gunter von Kannen. Fasolt and Fafner are, as you would expect them, bigger than life. Eva Johansson is a younger than the usual, and very appealing Freia.<br /><br />Perhaps conductor Daniel Barenboim and director Harry Kupfer chose such a \\"modernistic\\" way of staging the opera in order to direct our attention to the exceptional singing and acting of the cast, which I should add is matched by the superb quality of the sound that Barenboim gets from the Bayreuth Festspiele Orchestra.<br /><br />If I could have only one DVD set of Rheingold, this would be my choice.<br /><br />Die Walkure<br /><br />Paul Elming and Nadine Secunde are the best Siegfried/Sieglinde couple I have seen.  They bring youth, vitality and joy to their discovery of love scene that Ring viewers have come to love.  At the same time, Barenboim's exquisite control of the orchestra's intensity allows us to hear Wagner's leitmotifs--signature tunes--one after another, in a dazzling way that adds another dimension to the scene on stage.<br /><br />Just when you think that the highlight of this Walkure will be Siegmund/Sieglinde, along come John Tomlinson and Anne Evans with a Wotan/Brunnhilde that is electrifying.  Near the end of Die Walkure, along with the touching love between Wotan and his daughter, who disobeyed him in order to try to please him, we are treated to perhaps the best-ever introduction of the Siegfried/Redemption theme that we will hear later in Gotterdammerung.<br /><br />The laser light show used by director Harry Kupfer seems especially effective, augmented by lots of clouds of smoke for the closing scene featuring the Magic Fire music.<br /><br />You should find this a very memorable Die Walkure, both for the unique stage effects and the superb singing and acting.<br /><br />Siegfried<br /><br />If you are familiar with Richard Wagner, then you probably know of the leitmotifs, or signature tunes for which he is well-known. This technique is showcased here, as Barenboim helps the themes come through during the conversation between Mime and the Wanderer, as Wotan describes all the things that he has encountered in the world.<br /><br />The acting adds immensely to the power of this performance, as is illustrated by the way the Wanderer casually notices the broken pieces of Notung, Siegmund's sword, during his conversation with the evil dwarf. What could top fine acting, singing, and a conductor who makes sure we hear the leitmotifs?: Siegfried's sword forging. Siegfried Jerusalem excels in this supremely challenging role. It's difficulty lies in requiring a combination of singing and acting ability, AND ability as a percussionist. Siegfried's hammer has to tap out the hammer blows in synchronization with the orchestra--not an easy thing to do while you're concentrating on your singing and convincingness as an actor.<br /><br />Graham Clark joins the ranks of the most brilliant portrayals of Mime. A hero is amplified when the villain is convincing. Graham Clark is one of the most wily and agile Mimes.<br /><br />Want more reasons why this is such a great Siegfried?: Anne Evans whose Brunnhilde joins Siegfried to really heat up the stage in the Magic Fire music. Really--no one has sung \\"Sei Mein!\\" (Be Mine!) so passionately, and with all the leitmotifs swirling around you will be dizzied by the heat of their love.<br /><br />Gotterdammerung<br /><br />Most productions of Gotterdammerung tend to drag until the exciting finale where Brunnhilde returns the Ring to the Rhein.  Because of Barenboim's diligence in ensuring that all the leitmotif \\"signature tunes\\" come through, this Gotterdammerung is less susceptible to the dragging periods.  Siegfried's and Gunther's swearing Blutbrudershaft is punctuated by leitmotifs recalling Alberich's curse and the doom that clouds this brotherhood.  It is a reverse image of Wotan and Loge as they bargain with Alberich, way back in Das Rheingold.  Barenboim sees that Wagner's leitmotif reminds us of that.<br /><br />Just as Siegfried Jerusalem seemed born for the role of Siegfried (at least namesake wise), so Waltraud Meier makes an exceptional Waltraute.  Her admonitions to Brunnhilde remind us of why Gotterdammmerung is taking place:  the gold must be returned to the Rhein.<br /><br />Gotterdammerung is only as powerful as its Brunnhilde.  Anne Evans delivers that power, maintaining a stage presence and seizing Hagen's spear, even breaking it in two.<br /><br />Perhaps it's Wagner's reminder to take a look at mankind's history of destruction, but in the bonus section, Daniel Barenboim explains how the final scene was filmed before the terrorist attack in New York on September 11th.  Much as the world watched this horrible destruction on their tv sets, Gotterdammerung ends with \\"the cocktail set\\" watching the action on tv sets on stage.

0316666343|5.0|This was the most original book that I have read in quite awhile. The narrator of the story, Susie, is the murder victim. We see her family, her friends, and even her murderer, Mr. Harvey, in the days and years after her death through her eyes.    She leads us down that road as her friends and her 'crush' Ray try to understand and come to terms with her murder. As her family disintegrates, she begins to see them as individuals - even as those around them on Earth only see them as shadows of Susie.    Her father is convinced he knows who committed the crime and one night he follows a light into a neighbor's cornfield, only to be clobbered with his own baseball bat by some innocent high school kids. This is the last straw for Susie's mother. Her mother's loneliness is only amplified with Susie's death and she seeks comfort away from her husband. This eventually leads her to the other side of the country where she tries to forget.    Grandma Lynn moves in with her dad, brother Buckley and sister Lyndsey to try to help them cope with Susie's loss and their abandonment by their mother. The police have pretty much told the family that they have no leads and they are closing the investigation so Lyndsey decides to go looking for evidence herself. She watches Mr. Harvey's house, and one afternoon when he leaves, she breaks in and actually finds some evidence. She barely gets out of the house in time, but Mr. Harvey has seen her so knows that he needs to leave.    Come and read this book and follow her family as they move from her murder and their isolation as they come together year's later and are finally able to say out loud 'Susie is not coming home again.'    This novel was wonderfully written and gives us a picture of one little girl's heaven, which, while not always joyous, is stable and safe. Susie's heaven allows her to mature and move on in much the same way that her family does.

0316017922|5.0|[[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]]    I have read \\"The Tipping Point\\", \\"Blink\\", and many of Mr. Gladwell's New Yorker articles and am always intrigued and I usually learn alot.   For those of us who are reaching for success (in whatever form it takes for us) and have not reached it yet, this book helps illustrate how others have gotten there before us.     And, unfortunately, why many of us will never get there.  :(     Easily readable, hard-to-put-down, and with much wit, Malcolm Gladwell has written another very good book.    I recommended it and his other books for those looking to learn a little more about those super successful folks we read about in newspapers, books, and tv shows daily.     And for some insight on how maybe, with 10,000 hours of practice, we can get there too.

B001GCUNVW|5.0|Update:  Mickey Rourke just won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama.  And the award was richly deserved.<br /><br />Few actors have ever fallen as far from grace as Mickey Rourke.  After a string of lead performances in the 1980s, he almost completely disappeared for almost twenty years.  As Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson and Pam (otherwise known as the stripper Cassiday) agree, the eighties were great while the nineties sucked.  And just as The Ram's wrestling career peaked with his fight against The Ayatollah in the late eighties (otherwise known as Bob the used car dealer), so Mickey Rourke's career as a leading man ended at that time as well.  When mentioned at all, Rourke was known as the victim of some remarkably bad plastic surgery or his forays into boxing.  He did achieve some success as the brutish Marv in SIN CITY, but he still wasn't fully back.  But 2008 was clearly the year of the comeback.  Robert Downey Jr.'s return was widely and loudly heralded (as well it should have been), but it is dwarfed by Rourke's return.  In fact, there is a lot of talk that THE WRESTLER will bring Rourke his first Oscar nomination.  Interestingly, one of his best upcoming roles will be as the villain Whiplash in IRON MAN II, so the two comeback kids will appear together.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is so incredible as The Ram that it is almost impossible to imagine he was not the first choice to star in the film.  First choice was reputedly Nicholas Cage, but he left the project early on due to creative differences.  Second choice was Sylvester Stallone, who was busy working on ROCKY BALBOA.  But as these things so often do, it seems that everything worked out for the best.  Undoubtedly Rourke's performance in SIN CITY brought sufficient positive attention to garner the best role not merely in twenty years, but of his career.<br /><br />The story is one that anyone can love.  Someone who had once been on top now has fallen so low that he even gets locked out of the junky trailer he lives in.  His daughter won't talk to him and even his partially successful attempts to rekindle a relationship come to nothing when he once again disappoints her.  His body is betraying him and is completely broken down.  He wheezes when he breathes, he wears a hearing aide, and he can barely creep along down sidewalks.  He is clearly someone at the end of the line.<br /><br />The film is mainly filmed with a handheld camera.  The dynamics of a film using a handheld camera are completely different than one using a stationary or track camera.  In the latter, the actor has to play to the camera, being conscious to stay on his or her marks.  With a handheld camera, the camera plays to the actor.  There are many long scenes in the film where the camera follows Randy for long distances down hallways and sidewalks.  Or back and forth as he performs his day job.  The result is more of a documentary feel the makes it easy for the viewer to feel like they are there.<br /><br />THE WRESTLER also gives Marisa Tomei one of her best roles in years.  I've always liked her and have felt that she was unjustly criticized for winning the Oscar for MY COUSIN VINNY.  She gave a lovely performance in that role, but for some reason each year at Oscar time her win is cited as one of the least deserved wins ever.  I find that absurd.  An undeserved win would have been if Sylvester Stallone had won Best Actor for RAMBO.  Like Rourke, Tomei has been getting a lot of nominations for her role as the aging stripper Cassiday.  I may as well say what everyone I know who has seen this comes out and says.  She spends a good amount of the movie undressed.  Any 20-year-old woman in the world would die for her body.  Well, without the tattoos (which were pretty obviously fake).  Like Rourke, Tomei will unquestionably get a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the Oscars and should have a decent chance of winning.  She has little chance in the Golden Globes due to the bizarre nomination of Kate Winslet in that category in a role that was clearly a lead role.<br /><br />This was one of the best films I've seen in 2008 and my favorite Darren Aronofsky film ever.  The film has already won several awards either for Best Film (such as the Venice Film Festival) and Best Actor and will unquestionably get more nominations and wins.  Tonight's Golden Globes should clarify how successful it will be.  But regardless of awards, this is a great movie that I strongly recommend.  And Mickey Rourke's performance alone makes the film a must-see.ole that was clearly a lead role.    This was one of the best films I've seen in 2008 and my favorite Darren Aronofsky film ever.

B001GZ6QC4|2.0|This is one of the most over-hyped movies I have seen in a long time! Ledger was good, really good. I think the most impressive thing he did was come up with a fresh take on the Joker after several famous portrayals. But \\"Best Actor\\"???? The movie was cliche cliche cliche! NOTHING new or inventive. At all! Ohhhh... sometimes good people go bad. Really??? That is the best they could do? WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS FILM????? NOTHING! It had a lot of action, but was SO OBVIOUS what was going to happen, there was no suspense. And the \\"Raspy Batman voice\\" was REALLY IRRITATING! And what was up with the excessive makeup on some people? Was this movie sponsored by MAC Cosmetics?   WAY OVERRATED!
B0000019PA|5.0|I just LOVE this album!  I've had it for about 4 years and I listen to it several times a week; could listen to it several times a day and just never get sick of it.  When I have a bad day at work, I pull it up on the IPod (I've never deleted from rotation) and listen to it the whole way through.  It's just goofy and loud and fun to sing along to.  One of my favorites of all time!
B001IF3LYS|5.0|MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT! SHE WATCHES IT EVERY DAY AND HAS LEARNED MOST OF THE SONGS ALREADY. SHE HAS DOWN SYNDROME, AND IT TICKLES EVERYONE WHEN SHE SINGS THE SONGS SO DRAMATICALLY. GLAD I GOT IT FOR HER FOR CHRISTMAS.
B001E780W8|3.0|This album is definitely better than their last outing Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses). The last record sounded like Corey's voice was just completely shot and he was losing it. Then they returned after a 4 year hiatus and had a much heavier sound with Corey's voice sounding like the good ol' \\"Iowa\\" days. Standout tracks are: \\"Sulfur\\", \\"Psychosocial\\", \\"Dead Memories\\", \\"This Cold Black\\", \\"Snuff\\" and \\"All Hope is Gone\\". \\"Snuff\\" is an unexpected acoustic song which is actually one of my absolute favorites from them. Excellent song plain and simple. \\"Sulfur\\" follows the same formula that \\"Psychosocial\\" does with very heavy screaming in the verses followed by a catchy melodic chorus that will get stuck in your head. \\"Dead Memories\\" is more melodic than most of the record and serves its own purpose. The opening to it is reminiscent to Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman\\", but follows its own path after that. \\"This Cold Black\\" is just a heavy song from start to finish, no singing, just nice heavy screaming from Corey. The closer and title track serves that same formula. Starts of by kicking you in the face and continues to kick the crap out of you until you can't take anymore. This song made me look forward to this record because it returned to their heavy roots. Overall, good album, could be better though. Still much better than its predecessor.

B00004XPPE|4.0|This movie was created at the height of the cold war era when Americans lived under the paranoia of nuclear Armageddon unleashed by a Russian sneak attack.  The storyline almost completely parallels Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, in fact so much so that Kubrick et al. strategically filed a copyright infringement suit against the studio that produced Fail-safe to delay its release.  What differentiates Fail-safe from Dr. Strangelove is that while Kubrick uses humor and satire to mock at the absurdity of nuclear paranoia, Lumet skips the humor to give the story a serious treatment in Fail-safe.<br /><br />The main plot in both movies revolves around the inability of the Americans to recall the launching of an unintended (in Fail-safe) or unauthorized (in Dr. Strangelove) nuclear attack on the Russians using long range bombers.  In both movies, the high-caliber patriotic fervor of the American bomber crew played a key part in the Americans' inability to cancel the attack once the \\"go-code\\" was given.  The movies point out the weak links in both the human factor and also the technological limitations that can trigger a nuclear war.<br /><br />Although Fail-safe opened to miserable ticket office sales, it's a great thriller with a believable storyline.  It was capably directed by Sidney Lumet, complemented by superb acting by all the key actors.  I saw Dr. Strangelove before Fail-safe and found myself enjoying both almost equally as much.

Go watch it now!<br /><br />The DVD adds to the Horrible experience by including two different commentary tracks (including \\"Commentary! The Musical\\" -- a commentary track performed as a musical) as well as a great crop of special features.  My favorites were the Evil League of Evil application videos.  Each is a fan-made video application to the League selected by Joss & Co.<br /><br />The only downside I found was the disk itself seemed a little flimsy.  It plays fine, but the edges show some dark flaking internally.  Interestingly the video box itself does not display the official DVD logo.  I wonder where it was manufactured.<br /><br />Buy the disk and show your support of creative online ventures!

0679601791|4.0|This review is specific to the Modern Library hardback.  You probably know \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" but you may not be familiar with \\"The Chimes\\" or \\"The Haunted Man.\\"    According to the introduction, Charles Dickens wrote a Christmas story every year after the success of \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"  This edition includes two of those tales as well.  If you are a Dickens, or 19th century English literature, fan, you will probably enjoy those stories.  Noticeably missing from the book is \\"Cricket on the Hearth.\\"    Overall, the book has nice paper, text, and a great little biographical introduction.  I will definitely look for more Modern Library titles.
0452286751|5.0|I read this book of all places in Moscow while on a year abroad in Russia. I did not realize when I packed it that it could have gotten me in trouble there in 1987. I knew nothing about the book when I bought it, only that someone (I forgot who) had recommended it to me and I bought it in a second hand book store in Iowa City at some point in my college life. I read this in about 3 nights. It ensnared me from the first sentence. Ayn Rand became one of my favorite authors. This book is about two architects, one a \\"genius\\" of his own individual creativity and style, one a genius of collaborative style, and about a woman who is akin to the devil. When I read this book at age 20, I felt like it had extracted my view of the world and society from my brain. It worships godlike talent and condemns the power and mediocrity of the collective. An old friend once dubbed me a fascist for loving this book. It's ideal of \\"love\\" is rape. A more mature view of the content would find this a disturbing philosophy (compare to servant leadership and \\"The Wisdom of Teams\\"). Definitely a good read for anyone.

It is the result of many years of a research team trying to find the answer to the question: how to pull a business operating on a stagnating market out of a down-spiraling profit rut and sustain that success over a long period of time? One of the answers is Level 5 Leadership: Leaders who are persistent and humble: like an empowering Buddhist workhorse. I bought myself and my 4-year-old daughter stuffed pink hedgehogs to remind me of the hedgehog principle so I can remember to stay with mine in my personal life.

0385333846|4.0|This was the second book I read by Kurt Vonnegut and made him one of my favorite authors. I once purchased a Kurt Vonnegut book for my mother for her birthday when I was a teenager. It was the first time I had ever purchased a book for her as a gift. I don't know why I chose that book, It was Slapstick. It had a picture of a clown on the front and I guess I thought my mom needed more humor in her life. I don't think she read it, but I did. Anyway, I read Slaughterhouse Five for a High School History book report and I was hooked. I have read most of Vonnegut's works. He has remained one of my favorite authors for his humor, his hiccup-like writing style, his illustrations, his metawriting, and blunt portrayal of humanness.
B000002O4X|5.0|What an excellent cd.  The music is beautifully haunting and keeps us very entertained.  We had seen the movie a long time ago and recently got a chance to see it again.  The composer has created a timeless piece of music that carries the listener to another time and place.
0316017922|5.0|This is an excellant book about factors we can control and those we can't.  It is great for parents, mentors, and professionals seeking to excel.  I've given each of my children one of these books and recommended it for many of my friends and colleagues.
0316017922|5.0|I loved this book as I have loved Gladwell's other books- Blink and The Tipping Point.  They are so fascinating and this one especially so if you have ever wondered why some people make it big while others, with equal or more talent, don't.  The story of Bill Gates, The Beatles and Richard Oppenheimer were fascinating as was the story of one of the smartest men in the world.  Don't miss it if you are into some different reading and in this one we learn about Gladwell himself.  Very good.
0385333846|5.0|I don't want to write a long review, but I will say that this book gets better and better every time I read it. Yes, I think it does a very good job dealing with the disillusionment of war etc. The thing that I like best about this book is the fact that it is a circular--rather than a lineal--story. The main character goes forward and backward in time, and there's never really a clear-cut beginning and ending. I'm trying to get my students to like this book, but so far I've had no success. I think that the jumping around might confuse some people. But if you dig aliens, this book has those too!
B000V86OKG|4.0|The DVD arived promptly and without any problems.  i would recommend using this co.
0143038583|4.0|Although the pace of the narrative faltered at times, the book was informative without being boring.  I even incorporated a few lifestyle changes after reading it.  Definitely a worthy read but not necessarily something you rush out to the bookstore to get.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|If you didn't get a chance to see Wall-E in the theatres, then you really, really missed out.  If you did, then you know what an amazing movie this is.  The visuals, soundtrack, and story are great.  Also, look for little easter eggs that poke fun at Pixar's link to Apple Computers.<br /><br />Now, as for this DVD prodcut, it's fairly standard.  There are special features, commentary tracks, and so on.  The commentary is much better than I've heard on many DVDs.  Some, like the most recent Simpsons DVD just has the commentary people watching the episode and laughing.  With the Wall-e commentary you get great background info on the thought process of the director.<br /><br />The third DVD with the digital content is not all it's cracked up to be.  Sure, it supposedly works with iPods and Windows Media Player (I haven't tested), but it is full of DRM and you can't just load it onto your Tivo or MythTV.

B001H5X7I4|2.0|Tropic Thunder was not as funny as I thought it would be. Also not as good as past Ben Stiller films.<br />Too drawn out and stupid.<br />Only good things about this movie were Jack Black's performance and the Tom Cruise cameo.
0312383320|4.0|If you are going to read about Stephanie Plum you gotta lighten up.  In the \\"between the numbers\\" books, you need to suspend reality and believe in a little magic.  I wound up reading this in one day, a very pleasant romp.  I had quite a few laugh out loud moments and that is what I look for in JE.  I know this is a cash cow for JE and sometimes they feel a little \\"phoned in,\\" that is why I get them from the library and don't invest in a hardback.  This book was fun to read.
B001NLCBJI|1.0|This movie has no plot whatsoever. There is only one mildly funny part where Bill Murray is filming a commercial, the rest is slow, it's like watching a movie in real time, where everything takes hours to complete. It has no point, and really is \\"lost.\\" I have no idea why some people think this is a great movie, when it is utter crap!
B00009MGGI|5.0|I had never seen this show before buying it here.  It is excellent!  And for all I know, the British government is being portrayed accurately here.  That I can't verify, but I can say that it is extremely entertaining.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This collection of DVD's has some of the most AWESOME and rare footage ever captured on film and all is done in very high definition.My only disappointment is that this collection is narrated by some British guy and not Sigourney Weaver.I much preferred her voice over his but it doesn't diminish the incredible footage.
B000KJTC5A|5.0|I know for many that when it comes to the Duke the last movie they might think of is the movie McClintock but for me its the main movie I know him from and I admit that I love it. While John Wayne does show that he can be tough in this movie he shows that he can be very funny and be very good at it. The ability at comedy is only enhanced by Maureen O'Hara who plays McClintock's astranged wife who always seems to have a burr under her saddle but in those quick moments shows that under all her acts of high class that she still is very much like her husband. While some might disagree this film also gives people a small sense of what it was like in the West around the time that the film is taking place. It still is slightly Hollywood glamorized but it shows a more down to earth-type view of the West where you had to work but that doesn't mean you can't have a little fun along the way. This film also shows some of the relations between Native Americans and the American government and how they weren't always the best. This is a very entertaining movie and worthy to be part of any movie collection for those who wish to own it.
0525478183|5.0|My high school grandson and I both read this book.  He is a contemporary with the story; I passed that way in the late sixties.  We both identified with the characters, the poignancy of finishing high school and splitting up to go into the Big World, the difficulty of appreciating friends, and the eternal problem of parents.  Neither of us hesitates to pass the book along to friends.
1400082773|5.0|get it. read it. love it. barack obama is the greatest, and you'll love it!!!!!!!!!
2070518426|5.0|This is the french language version of \\"Harry Potter and the Scorcerer's Stone.\\" My daughter wanted one, and Amazon had it.
B001GQ2TGA|2.0|I'm a fan of Enya, but this CD was a bit of a downer.  Instead of being her usual quirky, uplifting music - it was more like the \\"Depressing Music of Winter\\".
0375826726|5.0|The story of the Dragon Ride, Eragon continues in the third Inheritance book. By now, it has been only months since Eragon first uttered \\"brisinger,\\" the ancient language word for fire. Now he finds himself without a Dragon Riders sword, being challenged to his very core, bound by a tangle of promises he may not be able to keep, and in the middle of one of the biggest political crises of the time.<br /><br />This third book of the Inheritance Cycle helps to fill-in past histories giving the reader a better understanding of why things have been playing out as they have. You learn more about the inhabitants of Alagaesia and why certain groups do not get along. I did find many parts of the book too slow. The pacing seems to come to a stand still at the author detailed certain back histories. Some of the information I felt was overly detailed, but I'm sure this knowledge will be key in the last and final book of the series.<br /><br />There is much more action on each adventure Eragon and Saphira find themselves on. You also get a better understand about the bond between a Dragon Rider and his Dragon. You also learn many secrets, which will come into play in the last and final book.<br /><br />I think Brisinger will not disappoint readers of the Inheritance Cycle.
031606792X|5.0|I have read the entire series in a total of 2 months. I thought out of all of them this was comparible to the 1st book. But this one was even more exciting. Lots of stuff happens that you don't predict. Great read!
B000ZLFALI|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed the movie, so I decided to get this for my parents.  I have no idea whether they have watched it yet, but I am sure they like it.
B0001QNFXW|3.0|Awesome sound, great live arrangements of their best tunes, beautiful set, great musicians, HORRIBLE video editing! I agree with other reviewers that this was a great concert, but the video? WOW what a frustrating disappointment. I would have given it 5 stars but the editing ruined it for me because we hardly got to see anything but Jay Kay strutting and singing (in that order).<br /><br />For those of you who wanted a \\"lead singer prance and dance\\" video this will thrill you. But those of you who wanted to actually SEE this band of funkmasters get their groove on, might as well just turn up the volume and turn off the TV because you don't get to see squat. Let me put it in numbers for you:<br /><br />Proportion of video footage showing the lead singer singing lyrics 50%<br />Proportion of video footage showing the lead singer being pretty, squirming around, and waving his hands in the air, while some of the funkiest musicians in the business groove out off-camera 49.9%<br />Proportion of video footage showing the musicians 0.1%<br /><br />Seriously, the average shot length of the singer is around 5 seconds. The average shot length of a musician is about 5 microseconds. We see each musician once or twice a song for about two beats, just to check and see if they're still there, then it cuts back to the singer prancing around, and he's not even that good at it. During the instrumental and solo sections, instead of showing the musicians getting funky, we see twenty-second shots of the singer shaking hands with the audience. WTF?<br /><br />Anybody who knows Jamiroquai knows that this band is not just a lead singer with extras. for crying out loud there's two percussionists, and the bass player has a 5-string bass (and knows what to do with it) but the first time we see his face is in the third track, and by that time we've seen his hands maybe three times for a total of about seven notes.<br /><br />Aside from that glaring problem, this video would be great. The set looks really cool, like a metal Aztec pyramid (though you hardly ever get to see it), they play some pretty cool adaptations of their tunes, and the sound is fantastic. It's just too bad because the MTV reject they found to edit the video thinks it's a Brittney Spears concert.<br /><br />I love Jamiroquai. I think they're some of the funkiest, grooviest dudes around. But we only get to see one dude in this show.oks really cool, like a metal Aztec pyramid (though you hardly ever get to see it), they play some pretty cool adaptations of their tunes, and the sound is fantastic.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have every seen.  The DVD came on time and in new condition.  I have watched it multiple times since then and have enjoyed every second.  Again, a must-have movie.
B00133KFGW|2.0|I have to give this movie 2 stars because it looked like it was well done as far as photography, acting, etc., but it did seem a bit draggy at times. I had to turn it off at about the hour mark when the kid, upon getting his hands on a guitar for the first time, banged out music worthy of a skilled musician. Even used a piano style technique on the fretboard that would at least have gotten a nod from Eddie Van Halen. Please, give me a break. I get it. It's a fantasy. Maybe science fiction? Of course it takes hours of study and effort to get anything resembling music out of any instrument. Ok, maybe not a kazoo. I guess the sale of musical instruments will skyrocket now. If it left you with a warm and fuzzy feeling, I think that's great. Good luck when your child, expecting similar miraculous results, entertains you with their new electric guitar - or better yet, new violin.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I would buy from this seller again. DVD came quickly, was brand new, and in packaging just like described.
0385340990|5.0|I write dozens of emails every day and I never reflected of how much of us is incorporated on the words that we put together that generate what we write.<br /><br />This book is about that. It is about us, what we do, how do we communicate with each other, our believes and who we are.<br /><br />The story itself is very British and hats off to England. Maybe I was one of those that have always seen the people of that country as the ultimate cynical, but with this book I noticed how authentic they are. The format indeed reminded me \\"84 Charing Cross Rd.\\" (I've seen the movie, never read the book). There is also some nostalgic tone because maybe, from what I see in the news, Britain, for better or for worse, is losing its identity.<br /><br />Beside that, I learned something about Guernsey and how that island lived through the war. That will also please the fans of historic novels, like me.<br /><br />The last thing I want is to sound cliche, but this book will change your life. Highly recommended.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|[[ASIN:B0011UBDTK Sex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)]] I purchased this set for my sister for Christmas; she was delighted with it.  It arrived before the expected delivery date and the package was under the tree Christmas morning.
B001BR5F4C|4.0|Well, to say that I loved both of these films is an understatement.  I loved them so much I had to buy them when they came out on Blu-Ray.
B000SQFC0E|2.0|Even though it says that it can still play on a normal dvd player, it does not work on our play station 2. Hopefully it would play on a regular dvd player like it says.
B001B93PQ0|4.0|I like the John Mayer Trio stuff much better than the John Mayer early/pop stuff.  Hey is a guitar phenom, and a deft songwriter, I just wish they would leave the \\"old\\" John behind.  This live set captures the entire spectrum of his music well and showcases all his talent, I enjoyed it very much.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|David Gilmour puts on a phenomenal live show and 'Live in Gdansk' just goes to show you how good it can be.  The entire album is an outstanding tribute to not only Gilmour and Pink Floyd, but his friend and bandmate Richard Wright who passed away some time after this show.  Highly recommended.
B0018TLRTK|5.0|Upon recieving this CD I placed the other Billy Idol greatest hits in my car where it can get scratched, lost, stolen,  or perhaps melt at some point in favor of this disc for the house. The other one was nice, but it comes down to about the last 3 or 4 songs that make this ideal for the Idol fan to get alot in a one disc collection. I'm not one to buy everything by him, although the Singles collection from Generation X is good, and add this and I'm a casual Idol fan still I guess.    Love the new songs \\"John Wayne\\" (a fav), and the last track also \\"New Future Weapon\\". Also the inclusion of \\"Speed\\", and a Devils Playground song in \\"World Comin' Down\\" which is a decent song also.   I was never a big fan of the latter half of the first Idol greatest hits (or at least the one with Don't You (Forget About Me), and an acoustic \\"Rebel Yell\\" (No...just no). So this one ups the ante and gives him a proper collection in my eyes anyway.    All the big hits are here, one by one they come and go and then you still get some rock stuff at the end to keep it going and fresh, not some boring new tracks either that sound like experimental tracks, these songs to me are up to par with the rest of the Cd.    Good, great, fabulous, 5 stars...and I may get Devils Playground eventually also, since I've heard 2 or 3 songs now from it and it sounds pretty decent.
0762408480|4.0|This version was \\"dumbed down\\" a bit for younger kids, but sticks fairly closely to the original language.  I read it to my 5-year old at Christmas and it was probably a bit too old for him. I'd say this version would be good to read to about a 7 year old or for a 9 or 10 year old to read on his or her own.  Illustrations were not that impressive.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Every song on David Cook's self titled album are songs that you will want to listen to over and over.  The song writing is amazing and of course, David's voice is beautiful.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This soundtrack is as addictive and cool as the movie, book, and characters are! And even better than this collection of awesome tunes from the movie (including one from \\"Edward\\" himself), I highly suggest checking out the Score soundtrack (Twilight Soundtrack - The Score), where all of Carter Burwell's scores will blow you away. I own them both! They ROCK!!! If you know and love the story and characters, you'll see why all of the music is 100% PERFECT! Get Score soundtrack for the heartstrings part, and the regular soundtrack for the super-cool part!
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|The service was excellent.  I didn't enjoy the movie.  Wasn't very good acting and the plot wasn't very good, it rambled too much.

B0015OKWL2|4.0|Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino co-starring together in any movie is worth seeing. Don't expect a classic Godfather type of movie, because it is NOT. If you enjoy watching cop dramas with great actors, you will enjoy this one. Just observe and take pleasure in the masters at work. Ending, never see it coming.
0446691437|5.0|I was introduced to Steven Pressfield by happening upon his [[ASIN:0385519702 Killing Rommel: A Novel]]. As a fan of military fiction, I moved on to other of his novels and marvelled at Pressfield's talent. Somewhere along the line I came across mention of \\"The War Of Art\\" and being a chronic procrastinater thought it worth the few dollars to read what Pressfield had to say on the subject.<br /><br />  I doubt that this or any other book can by itself move anyone away from procrastination or, as Pressfield puts it more accurately, overcoming \\"Resistance\\". Pressfield looks squarely at the writer and the problems of putting words down.<br /><br />  \\"Resistance\\", as Pressfield calls it, is fear. He breaks the book into three sections. The first is \\"Resistance: Defining the Enemy\\". In this he identifies Reseistance as fear in its endless manifestations. Pressfield demonstrates clearly that he is no stranger to the amorphous thoughts that keep the writer from writing. In fact, reading this section is kind of creepy since Pressfield seems to have gotten inside my brain.<br /><br />  The second section is \\"Combatting ResistanceA: Turning Pro\\". Here, Pressfield lectures the reader in gentle, but very firm, ways to put attack Resistance head-on, to simply get on with it, to do what the inner you is directing the outer you to do. Easier said then done, though Pressfield gives as a good set of instructions.<br /><br />  The third section is where Pressfield will alienate a lot of people because they are so thoroughly modern that they don't understand what Pressfield is talking about. In Book Three \\"Beyond Resistance: Higher Realm\\", Pressfield talks of muses, angels, higher intelligences and even uses the dreaded \\"G\\" word. For so many people today, who have no knowledge of history and mythology and carry their militant atheism as a badge of belonging, these words will make them cross themselves in fear and loathing.<br /><br />  An actually intelligent agnostic or atheist (the former personified by Albert Einstein) would understand Pressfield. He is not telling anyone to go to a house of worship and kneel in prayer, but rather expressing the same sense of amazement Aristotle and so many other ancients did at the mystery of creative expression. Where do ideas come from? Where does the spark of unique, original artistic expression come from? It is here that Pressfield distinguishese between mere hack and true creative artist. Pressfield can answer the question of where creativity comes from any better than you or I, so he falls back upon angels and muses. Why not? As Joseph Campbell, in particular, has shown us, humans want answers and when answers are not immediately forthcoming, they will create them.<br /><br />  Thus Pressfield, in a most satisfying way, tells us to open our selves to the muses and angels - the forces we do not understand - and let our creative thoughts out, rather than keep them inside because of fear, Pressfield's \\"Resistance\\".<br /><br />  This is an excellent, original and inspiring book that every writer or otherwise creative person should read at least once and than keep at hand for when they next encounter the \\"Resistance\\".<br /><br />Jerrywould understand Pressfield.

6305428352|2.0|OK, let's see. Mr. Holland is a neglectful, sullen, and resentful father, who diminishes his son because of his deafness, and neglects his wife in favor of his obsession with completing his decidedly mediocre \\"opus.\\" He also develops an inappropriate relationship with a female student; while there may not have been physical contact, he also obsesses on her, and actually entertains the idea of running off to New York with her. Later, forced out of teaching (maybe due to his attitude problem?) his alumni all gather for a tribute concert, where the opus is revealed in all of its unfortunate banality. Sorry, this one just wasn't for me.
1563894696|5.0|When you consider whether a story is successful, you must think  - did it do what it set out to do (tell a complete story)? And, did it touch me?<br /><br />The answer in both cases for this book is yes. Within the confines of the comic book page, it constructs valuable, engaging characters and takes you through their rises and falls. It tells the story, not just of a serial killer whacking mob icons, but of the effect of the killer's work on the town, on its heroes and servants.<br /><br />The art in it is simply gorgeous as well, a heavy-handed and murky-colored journey through a world as noir as any 50s detective novel, with women and men dressed appropriately to that era as well.<br /><br />It's a good piece, a period piece, but tells a timeless story which can stand alone, away from the DC universe.

B000NYT1M6|3.0|Bought two for Christmas.  Boys are 6 and 4.  They love the trucks!!  But I DONT!!!! I know that by the end of January something on the truck will be broken.  Everthing is plastic and fragile.  My boys want to push the trucks all over the place and they can't because the truck wiggles underneath them.  So they sit and play with them instead of being active and then they get bored after about 10mins.  They will not get the oppurtunity to haul rocks and dirt because it is not sturdy enough for that.  A dump truck that can't haul that's handy.  What happen to toys made to be played with.  Not really worth the money.  I should have sent them back and went to Walmart and bought Tonka!!!!
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This film has become the go-to disc for our new Blu-Ray player. My daughter and I find so many wonderful new details on every viewing. The video quality is so outstanding that you feel you could walk right into the world onscreen.

B000F7CMRM|5.0|Looking at the negative reviews about this movie, all I can think is that the truth really does hurt...    This movie gives you a clear link that although it can be called \\"conspiracy theory\\", it's not beyond comprehension.  The link is very simple and clear.    If you like \\"conspiracy theories\\" than this is definately a great movie.

B000002B5L|4.0|Although the Fugees as a group didn't hang together as long as the Wu-Tang Clan, no one can doubt that their rap style and obscure samples in \\"The Score\\" are like no other rap group's.<br /><br />From the beginning, Wyclef lays down a monologue which would make mob actor Marlon Brando proud. At first, the concept album about Haitian refugees acting as Italian mobsters is somewhat weird. However, the Fugees are referring more to their African American \\"family\\" of lower class gangsters.<br /><br />It all sounds really cool too. The song \\"Family Business\\" has an Italian guitar to set the mood of a New York world of mafiosos, where the Fugees rap about the dangers of drug hustling and gangster life.<br /><br />The Fugees' freestyle raps are clearly top-notch as well. Lauryn Hill lays down awesome rhymes and sings an awesome chorus line in \\"Ready or Not.\\" And there's nothing cooler than Praz's rhyme at the end, where he says, \\"With my crew from lock high I refugee from Guantanamo Bay/Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay.\\" Of course, not even Praz could have predicted that America would hold prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, but nonetheless, the entire flow is just so entrancing.<br /><br />All throughout the album is a cool, spacelike world of paranoia and frustration within the lives of the African-American mafioso character. Along the way, the Fugees aren't afraid to diss mafioso rap groups either. In the intro to \\"Fu-Gee-La,\\" Wyclef and Pras play out a hilarious skit involving a Chinese restaurant, where the restaurant owner goes kung-fu on the Fugees.<br /><br />The low key, bass-oriented vibe in this album is so entrancing that nobody can resist it. And the entrancing rhymes continue in songs such as \\"Fu-Gee-La,\\" where Lauryn Hill raps, \\"Ha Ha Ha Ha, You shouldn't diss refugees and/Ha Ha Ha Ha, You whole sound set's bootie.\\" This is one of the few albums where the low-key beats and rhymes just correspond so well with each other that the resulting sound is astounding.<br /><br />Of course, Lauryn Hill's rendition of \\"Killing Me Softly With His Song\\" might be the spotlight of the entire album, making it an excellent album opposing the ghettoization of African-Americans. There's more than a few awesome intimate solo singing performances by Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean.<br /><br />Finally, Pras did a good job collaborating with a diverse range of rappers in the song \\"Cowboys.\\" Some of the awesome rhymers include Pacewon, Rah Digga, who was rapping with Busta Rhymes in the Flipmode Squad, and Young Zee from The Outsiders. All in all, they rock the house with freestyles on blazing guns, blazing in their saddles and, ahem, drug blazing.<br /><br />While I did get a little tired of hearing the two remixes of \\"Fu-Gee-La,\\" I still love this album, which distinctly blends the Fu-Gee-La raps of Wyclef, Lauryn Hill and Praz with the Italian vibe of \\"The Godfather.\\" It's more melodic than a Wu-Tang Clan album could ever be, and it has so much more soul than any other rap album out there.tion of \\"Killing Me Softly With His Song\\" might be the spotlight of the entire album, making it an excellent album opposing the ghettoization of African-Americans.

1603580557|5.0|In a nutshell, this book is about systems.  So much more than this, it is a journey into the meta-rules of how the universe and everything in it comes and \\"plays\\" together.  There is one thing to be understood that applies to physiology, businesses, economies, plants and puppies alike.  Everything is a system.  And all systems have behaviors and rules.  As Donella Meadows writes:  \\"The trick...is to recognize what structures contain which latent behaviors, and what conditions release those behaviors -- and where possible to arrange the structures and conditions to reduce the probability of destructive behaviors and to encourage the possibility of beneficial ones.\\"<br /><br />Grasping \\"the whole universe\\" is certainly a momumental task.  The book brilliantly presents concepts in very graspable units.  She starts with  picturing what a system is -- a stock with inflows and outflows that affect its stability and all of which are further affected by feedback loops and delays.<br /><br />So armed with this model, individuals may be better guided in their decisions and actions as it becomes clear that actions can beget other actions and reactions (or unintended consequences.)  But there is even more complexity.  For instance, policies are a way to control the stocks and flows within a system.  However, one of several behavior archetypes is policy resistance which comes from the bounded rationality of the actors within a system, each with his or her own goal.  Meadows takes the reader on a deep and thought-provoking journey through all the behavior archetypes of systems.  The result is an empowering \\"forewarned is forearmed\\" knowledge.<br /><br />That is the ultimate goal of this book.  When people affect positive change in the world -- and it just may be everyone's duty to do that -- it is through smart and correct controls on a system. Ms. Meadows then gives the knowledge to do this.  She lays out the leverage points in any system -- the opportunities for making things right or better.  The coda is a legacy of thoughts to live by, the last and perhaps most important of which is \\"Don't Erode the Goal of Goodness.\\"<br /><br />With such profound applicability, this book is the handbook for living.  Everyone on the planet should read it.oda is a legacy of thoughts to live by, the last and perhaps most important of which is \\"Don't Erode the Goal of Goodness.\\"    With such profound applicability, this book is the handbook for living.

B001CC7PPI|5.0|A great version of this movie - bonus features digitally remastered - exactly as advertised.  A Hitchcock classic - a must see!
039925045X|5.0|A beautiful edition of the old classic, complete with box and jacket to protect it. However, if you're looking for a version of The Hungry Caterpillar for a 5-year-old to drag around, this is not it. It's too large for a child to handle. But size, along with the larger graphics, will inspire awe and wonderment in a child, and it's the perfect book<br />for bringing out to make lap-reading a special time.
0307120007|5.0|Even though Pat the Bunny is such an old classic (published in 1940, and the first touch and feel book ever) I had never heard of it till my son was born 3 years ago. Many librarians and book experts recommended it for babies and young children. Thought about getting it when he was a small infant, almost did when my husband and I were in a bookstore and saw it there. But hubby convinced me it looked too cheap and flimsy, even I thought it looked pretty bland, by only by looking at the cover. Thought I would just see if it was at my local library instead of buying it.Then  just forgot about it altogether.<br /> When my daughter was born I tried to look for it in the library, they did not have a copy there. So I said, what the heck, maybe I will just order it from Amazon. Saw some really excellent reviews here, but also some saying the product was flimsy, not worth it, etc. I also wondered if it may even be too babyish for my now 3 year old son and even my daughter who is over 1 year old, since some reviewers were saying they got it for their infants.<br />Finally did order it and I must say I am really glad I did. I read on a children's book site that every toddler should \\"pat the bunny\\" and it is true!It is a very interactive experience, The children can pat the soft fur of the bunny(which is artificial by the way, animal lovers), play  play \\"peek-a-boo\\" by lifting a \\"blanket\\"(a piece of fabric) to see one of the characters faces underneath (My kids LOVED this!), smell flowers that really smell like baby powder, feel a scratchy beard of the father character (sandpaper), read a little book within the book and finally put their little finger through \\"Mommmy's ring\\" in the book.<br />Both my son and my daughter loved the book, my son could not stop smiling throughout and my daughter seemed fascinated by every page too. I do recommend getting this book for your new baby or as a gift to new parents, but having said that, I don't think even a 3 or 4 year old is too maturefor this book. Even though my son loves it when I read more wordy Dr. Seuss books or even a lengthy storybook like the story of Babar the elephant, he still liked this little book very much as mentioned.<br />As far as the illustrations go, yes as some people have mentioned they could be seen as unimpressive, or not very colourful, but this is a simple little book, where the focus is not really on a great visual experience, but more of an interactive one, and there is something soft and comforting about the pictures anyway.<br />A warning, I do agree with some of the reviewers, the book is a little flimsy, it is a plastic spiral book format,maybe that is the way it has always been, but it is not the best style, this is one thing I would like to change, however, just keep it high up somewhere, don't let the little ones have access to it, till you want to read to them. It is also a bit small ( about 4\\" by 3\\" rectangle) but I did not mind that and neither did the kids, it is cute size, I don't know if there is a bigger size available elsewhere, but this one from Amazon is small.<br />Overall very happy,sounds cliche, but \\"never judge a book by its cover!\\" Also, I must say Amazon's service was great,they delivered promptly. Thank you very much!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This movie is great on its own but is perfect when paired with dystopian literature of any kind in a school setting.  The only downfall is the R rating, which requires parent permission slips before a full showing of the film.
1400086035|5.0|LOVE Jim Dale.  What a fantastic audio.  A pure joy to listen to EVERY Christmas!
B001E75QH0|5.0|This collection has all four of the Indiana Jones movies. Each disc includes special features on the making of each movie and how the character, Indiana Jones, was created. They even have interviews with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Each of the movies are in their own cases. A perfect gift for anyone who loves Indiana Jones, action movies or Harrison Ford!
B001G0LBZ6|5.0|If you loved the flavor of the movie then the music of it fits in perfectly, each track seems to have its own personality making this a must own, especially for fans.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|Lots of great reviews right on target for this great movie-making. My wife and I saw it (hardly anyone else did) a couple of years ago in the theatre and were left speechless, especially at the end with that glorious music. What a great story taking place in old Vienna (Prague) and draped in shimmering music by Phillip Glass - others have discussed the plot better than I can.<br /><br />Well, it appeared on TV, I saved it my Dish recorder, and my wife just shakes my head as she finds me watching this movie for the 52nd time. This is a timeless love story with unforgettable performance by Norton, Biel, Giamonti and all the others. The magic shows as discussed in previous comments get darker and darker and you never figure out (like the inspector would like to) how it's done. That's the way it should be.<br /><br />Some movies don't make an impact when they come out but with time they blossom and become classics. The Shawshank Redemption is another example. Those butterflies at the end - get this disc and treasure.
0451529308|4.0|I've read \\"Little Women\\" several times through the years - the first time when I was about 10 years old I guess, and always enjoyed it.     The story is simple and sweet, but I think it still carries a strong message about the strength in the bonds of women.  Progressive for the time, Alcott presents in the March women different \\"types\\" - Meg, the pretty,  domestic one; Jo, the tomboyish, independent rebel; Beth, the too-good-for-this-world moral angel; Amy, the flighty, spoiled, bratty princess - at least at first; and then Marmee, the redeemed wild child who is now their strength and moral compass.  The men, while not maligned are almost incidental, serving as props to highlight the different personalities of the women.       The characters are wonderfully developed, as we see them grow through the years.  The setting is very well described - you can \\"see\\" the gardens and rooms.  And again, having been written for young women, the writing is easy to read and follow, if a bit long-winded.  Despite Jo's detailed character development, I feel her love story was rushed and not developed enough - as opposed to those of Meg and Amy.  I imagine her relationship with Bhaer is delved into more in the sequel \\"Little Men\\", which I haven't read yet.     Although I like the book very much I think it suffers in comparison with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  Even though the time frame of \\"Little Women\\" - during and after the Civil War - is almost 100 years later than \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - late 18th century/early 19th century - I think Austen's classic feels more relevant.     I definitely recommend \\"Little Women\\" to everyone, not just pre-teen and teen girls.  It's a beautiful, well-told and surprisingly progressive story.
B0012GVKVY|4.0|'I, Robot' features very good quality 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer,I may as well begin at the opening titles and the real kicker is how pristine the image actually is.It's quite simply delivers one of the best transfers I've ever seen.I couldn't believe how realistic it all sounded. Just listen to the pouncing robots, the engines throttling against the road.
0545128285|5.0|I know that the review process is for all opinions but when I read some of the reviews out there sometimes I wonder what people are expecting when they spring for the 10 to 20 bucks it costs for a book.What do you want it to do? Change your life? Reveal the secrets of the universe (I was just ordering the secret and saw the reviews for that, so that was fresh on my mind).When I got this book I was expecting a collectors type of thing that would be informative and fun for how JK's books were inspired.I feel like that's exactly what I got.It was definitely worth the money or even maybe more with the discounts everyone offers. For what this is they did all they could do. There is pictures and stories and it is absolutely gorgeous. I keep it on my coffee table and everyone picks it up. If you're looking for another Harry Potter novel to keep you enthralled for a few days wait for the next one to come out for crying out loud.
B0013D8LKO|5.0|Well, it's their world; I'm just living in it.   Trying to understand this flippin' movie is like contemplating the nature of sex, love and death within the pages of Vogue magazine. It is a mind f***.    The movie was full of blah blah blah talking and I was like stfu! If they would have been saying something remotely interesting then fine but especially Nicole Kidman's dialogue was really irritating and pointless. She's tell these stories and talk about her feelings and I was so not caring at all. I wanted to care I just couldn't. I guess you could say I couldn't care less about her character. Her voice would get all screechy and sorry, that ain't acting, that's irritating. I've seen her in other better roles...The Hours and The Others were both much better for her. Excellent films, too.    Tom C.'s character was awesome, very interesting; I liked him and was fascinated with the character arch he experienced. Tom Cruise is wonderful as an 'everyman'. It's when he's saving the world or being some sort of hero that I get irritated with him. I'm waiting for him to do a Sling Blade. He'd knock that s*** out. Guaranteed.    Kubrick is my favorite director (Wes Anderson is a close second) despite only having created a handful of films, they are among the finest movies ever made. I find I need to understand Eyes Wide Shut in order to fully appreciate who he was as a Director. Like he was so maddeningly brilliant that there must be things there that dumbass me can't see. If Kubrick did it, it has to be something special, something worth tearing apart and trying to figure out. So that's where I'm at with this film. It is a process of revelation.     Great. So that means I have to buy the DVD, book, and do numerous google searches on disturbing things like mind-control, sex slaves and occult Rituals. But if it'll help me understand 2001: A Space Odyssey on a deeper level, a little better, it's ON.
B001GKJ2FW|2.0|My wife and I had seen the stage show twice. As I think about it, she may have seen it a third time with friends. We really enjoyed it every time. The movie was not half as much fun. Pierce Brosnan was a terrible casting choice. He can't sing at all. The actor playing Bill was not really all that good either. Finally Meryl Streep overpowered her role. It was supposed to be light and fun but she brought way too much depth to the role. Way to weighty. This was supposed to be light and fun folks.
B001AUKUSG|5.0|This is a soul classic. It is the best Otis Redding album, and I believe one of the best albums of all time. Every song on this album could be a chart topper.

0810993139|5.0|Are you 25+ and looking for a fun read?  Are you tired reading the same action, adventure, drama, biography novel over and over?  You want the gratification that comes when you read an entire book in a couple hours?  Read this book.  Obviously the demographic for this and all of Jeff Kinney's Wimpy Kid books lies somewhere in the 10, 11, 12 range, but the big secret that nobody wants to tell you is that this is a fun book for adult kids too.  The comics are hilarious.  That writing is a blast.  The characters are fun and easy to relate to.  Kids at any age will enjoy this book.  How anybody could give this any lower than four stars is beyond me.  Read it.  You will like it.  Just don't let your mom catch you reading too late.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|This is a 2-disc special edition starring Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, extremely talented veteran actors who have starred in many many movies.  I grew up watching musicals, so it was refreshing to see one today.  Although the plot is a tad weak, and many of the songs are not exactly Rogers and Hammerstein, there are good musical numbers throughout the movie with lots of singing and dancing.  Much (or maybe all?) of the music is Abba. I guess I would say that some of the music is great and some is just ok.  Pierce Brosnan (bless his little heart) sings 3 songs.  Now, he is not exactly Mario Lanza but his numbers add to the overall production (and I'll leave it at that.) EVERYBODY sings in this musical, which is great.<br /><br />The movie opens (and continues) with beautiful scenery.  A wee bit of the film (in the beginning) was filmed in London, but most of the production was filmed in Greece, on 2 small islands and on the mainland (Skopelos, Skiathos, and Mouresi-Magnesia).  Raised on the Greek island of Kalokairi by her unmarried mom Donna (Meryl), beautiful and delicate 20-year old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) explains to her girlfriends, Lisa and Ali, how she has always felt \\"empty\\" not knowing who her father is. She got her little paws on Donna's diary, and in reading the exciting parts (the \\"dot, dot, dot\\" parts), she determines that one of Donna's 3 past boyfriends just HAS to be Daddy.  Let's see--Is it Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Harry (Colin Firth), or Sam (Pierce Brosnan)?<br /><br />Sophie is about to marry Sky (Dominic Cooper), so while Donna is sending out invitations to her best friends, Rosie, the stuff-your-vegetables cookbook writer (Julie Walters) and Tanya, the vixen whose 3rd husband paid for her plastic surgery (Christine Baranski), Sophie sends out some invitations too. Sophie invites Bill, Harry, and Sam!  When Sophie signs Donna's name to the invitations, the guys leave their digs and come to Kalokairi for the wedding.  All the time, the guys are wondering why Donna invited them to her daughter's wedding when they haven't heard from Donna in 20 years. Sophie wants her Daddy to give the bride away at the wedding, so she hides the guys in Donna's villa-hotel, but Donna finds them.  Of course, the plot takes off from here but it is pretty simplistic.  There is not a whole lot more that happens.  As i said before, the attention is more on the music. Chick-flick?  Yeah.  I guess it is.<br /><br />Bonus features include a sing-along with on-screen lyrics for 22 musical numbers; a deleted musical number, and a commentary with the director.  Special Edition exclusives are:<br />1) The making of Mamma Mia! the movie;<br />2) Anatomy of a musical number \\"Lay All Your Love On Me\\";<br />3) Becoming a Singer;<br />4) Behind the Scenes with Amanda;<br />5) On Location in Greece;<br />6) A Look Inside the Movie;<br />7) \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme\\" Music Video;<br />8) Bjorn Ulvaues Cameo;<br />9) Deleted Scenes and Outtakes; and<br />10) Digital Copy of the movie (that you can download to your ipod, but you need an internet connection and the password that they give you on the insert).<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars because i kinda averaged it out, which I don't normally do in my reviews.  I gave the storyline a 3, because I thought the plot was much too simplistic, realizing though that the director likely put more attention on the musical part of the production.  I gave the music and dancing a 4, because some of the songs were great and some were just ok,  I gave the gorgeous scenery a 5.  The acting while singing deserved a 4 or 5.  I especially liked the feeling that Meryl put into \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" scene during her discussion with Pierce right before the wedding, on a cliff in Greece.<br /><br />I would have liked to hear a little Greek music here and there, since they were in Greece (Duh!).  I think I only heard one Greek word in the whole movie (Duh--again). A little unrealistic. But, there was a lot n of singing and dancing, some great numbers, great choreography, many great songs, and sometimes large numbers of townspeople joining in the productions.  I found myself laughing out loud a few times and it was a real feel-good movie--very entertaining. I did enjoy it and would watch it again.  The bonus features were also entertaining.<br /><br />Just DON'T make the same mistake I did!  I watched this movie right before bedtime, so I heard \\"Dancing Queen\\" in my head ALL NIGHT LONG!!!ometimes large numbers of townspeople joining in the productions.

B0018RWMNM|5.0|This is one of our favoraite movies and seeing it in bluray is even better. It arived before Christmas and we are very happy with our purcahse.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My son in college requested this game for Chritmas.He said a lot of guys in his dorm play it.I had never heard of it.I am glad he asked for it.There's a lot of strategy involved but not too complicated.Would recommend this game for anyone early teen to adult.
B001F12J3Y|5.0|Not sure if I really needed the 3-D version of this movie, but it was fun to watch in 3-D, nonetheless.  This is a very inspirational Christmas movie that the entire family will love, whether you watch the 3-D or 2-D version.  We don't have any small children in our lives, but my husband and I have named this movie our all-time favorite in the holiday category.  I think this is a movie that any family will want to watch over and over again, Christmas after Christmas.  It is bound to become a classic in the years to come.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Good sequel that manages to stand on its own merits. I loved that bad things did not constantly befall the lead characters as it did in the first book.
0316035904|5.0|Although this book is seemingly seasonal, I would recommend it to anyone, anytime looking for some dark humor.  Although this book is rather small in terms of pages and does admittedly have a few stories that are also included in Sedaris's book 'Naked,' I still found enough new, laugh out loud content to make this book worth my time.  Definitely worth adding to your library if you're a Sedaris fan.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This item was bought as a Christmas present for my son and his wife.  They had never seen the Godfather.  They said that this blu-ray set was fantastic.
0061537934|5.0|I received this book as a gift, and the concept of the story being told from the dog's point of view was pretty bizarre... so I didn't read it for a long time. But my pile of books ran unusually dry, and on a day I felt experimental, I picked ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN up and started reading. I will admit it was strange getting past the first page... from the dog's point of view, you find yourself asking how much you want to suspend disbelief.  BUT... I kept reading and then I couldn't put it down.  I had it with me at all times... reading while I stood and waited for my son's school bus, or in the parking lot when I had three minutes to spare.  This is a BEAUTIFUL book.  Funny, witty, smart and sophisticated. But also a poignant look at family life from another view looking in.  Not so much OUTSIDE looking in, but INSIDE looking in, but differently.  It did make me look at my own family differently, my relatioship with my husband and my in-laws.  It's also a tribute to unconditional love and the depth of our spirit.  It's also a tear jerker and I bawled and bawled my eyes out.  I'm not so much a crazy die-hard dog person either.  This is endearing and a quick read - but not in any way an \\"easy read.\\"  Put this on your list and make sure you have an open mind when you start.  You will be better for it.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I TOTALLY enjoyed the Everwood series and was sooo bummed when it ended. A while ago I happened across the theme song on emusic and downloaded it. Every time I heard it on my MP3 player I yearned to see the show again. I found the first season on DVD here at Amazon and promptly ordered it. I was so contented to sit down and view the pilot show again. I'm just looking for my next chance to sit down and enjoy the whole first season show by show again. My ONLY regret is so far I have not seen the 2nd season out to buy!! I feel like a kid with my enjoyment factor and I am 50! :)
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I love this one. The last album sounded much like the one before it, but this album has some fun new sounds, some twists and turns. It's got a few electronic effects, like echoing (??), which I'm completely into. If you love more organic music, this might bother you. My husband seemed to think it was out of place, but I'm all over it.    There are a few songs on this album, such as \\"I Still Care For You,\\" that I had to play over and over when we first got it. They're wonderfully haunting, and I can't get enough of Ray's soft, somewhat scratchy voice. This album stays in our stereo. It doesn't leave. I hIghly recommend it.
B00005J7I5|5.0|Tool's \\"Lateralus\\" is definitely their most popular CD, and my favorite next to \\"10000 Days\\". If your just getting into Tool, this should definitely be your first buy. \\"Lateralus\\" is bordering on psychedelic, and doesn't show as much anger as \\"Undertow\\" or \\"Aenima\\". It's a pretty approachable album, and features some killer tracks like the radio famous \\"Schism\\" and \\"Parabola\\" two of my favorite songs. If you can get past the random as tracks with strange noises and stuff you'll LOVE this CD! ALSO PURCHASE (or steal for all I care) 10000 DAYS AND UNDERTOW!
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|If you love fast paced classical music with a rock beat you will love this music as much as I do. Shipped in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
B0012Q732O|2.0|Ten things I learned from 10,000 B.C. (spoilers beware!):<br /><br />1) Nobody speaks in contractions.<br />2) Everybody is dirty.<br />3) Nobody speaks the same language except for one guy in Africa, and yet the translation of \\"Mammoths\\" is \\"Mannak.\\"<br />4) The way to get a bull mammoth to stampede is to stand up in the middle of the herd and scream your head off.<br />5) Even isolated arctic tribes have tremendous racial diversity.<br />6) The pyramids were built either by space aliens or Atlanteans.<br />7) Egyptian pharaohs were white guys who spit a lot.<br />8) 10,000 B.C. had its own versions of velociraptors: giant angry chickens.<br />9) For some reason only white men can lead the more powerful and numerous African tribes.<br />10) Blue-eyed girls are hot.
B001E75QH0|5.0|I was delighted to find the complete Indiana Jones collection on Amazon and ordered it as a Christmas gift for my husband. Since it was the height of the shipping season, I wondered if it would arrive in time since I could not afford the high-priced shipping method.  I was amazed that it showed up in less than a week...well in advance of Christmas Day.  The DVDs are of excellent quality and we have been enjoying them tremendously in the comfort of our own livingroom.  A \\"must have\\" for Indy fans!
B00003CXMG|5.0|One of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.  The soundtrack is incredible, also.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|Wow!! This film has stood the test of time,and, even in this time, its still provocative!! E
B001BNFR6W|1.0|At this point, I think there should just be a re-release of the complete box-set :    - With WIDESCREEN versions when shot in WIDESCREEN  - With the COMPLETE episodes.    Just for the sake of freedom of expression and artistic integrity.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|Hell Boy 2, in my opinion is far better than the fist time around,  in terms of direction, acting, story and fx. I hope if there's a third HB  that Del Toro (hope I got the name rite!) directs it too! E
B000E1JOSE|5.0|We love this CD. I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he is very happy. We saw the Black and White show on PBS and I ordered the CD from Amazon. It was a great gift and we are both enjoying the music. Thanks for the great service.
6304490119|4.0|A word of caution: if you're only familiar with the hit television show \\"Stargate SG-1\\" and have never seen this movie, you'll be very surprised.  It was made three years before the first season of the show ever came out and doesn't have the same scope.  Many of my favorite characters from the show are not in the movie.<br /><br />That said, I still very much enjoy the movie, Stargate (which was incidentally made by many of the same people who went on to do \\"Independence Day\\").  The acting in it was very good.  James Spader does an excellent job portraying the nerdy archaeologist Daniel Jackson.  Also, Kurt Russell is wonderful as Colonel Jack O'Neil (Richard Dean Anderson fans beware - It's totally different from Anderson's O'Neill.)  The special effects were good, and the scenes (the village, the pyramids, etc.) were beautiful.  David Arnold's musical score to the movie is great, too - much of the music from the movie made it into Stargate SG-1.<br /><br />The pilot of the TV show is a direct sequel to this movie.  If you like Stargate SG-1, or if you're just a fan of action/adventure or sci-fi movies, this is a great one to add to your collection.
B00129H7VS|5.0|The effect Band of Brothers creates is sobering. Unlike Saving Private Ryan there is no hollywood window dressing in terms of the storytelling. No fake subplots written in to make you hate the enemy more. Theres actually not a strong dramatization of 'the bad guys' at all  ..its more about doing your duty and doing your job in what is probably the most stressful conditions any human being can be placed in; facing death in battle. And killing others in battle. Soldiers throughout history have faced such conditions, but in this case we see the real American character showcased. A free society will always field the strongest armies. Theres something in the DNA of human life on this planet that seems to favor that mentality- even when applied to war. Thats what shines through in Band of Brothers: the American character taking center stage, at the boots on the ground level. Freedom isnt free. Its sobering.
B000E5KJHA|4.0|I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas, and it came in the mail quickly.  When she opened the movie, the dvd case has a crack in it.  It wasn't a big deal though because it was used.  The movie plays great no problems, and my daughter was very happy.  I will buy more movies from Amazon in the future.
B001ILHY1I|3.0|If you are looking for snappy dialog, a complex believable plot, excellent acting or a thought-provoking ending, you are looking at the wrong movie!  The dialog is a means to move from the last to the next fight or car chase.  The acting is good enough for this move but you will not see any of these people at many award shows.  Ian McShane, is the best named actor in the move.  A number of the supporting cast members are excellent within the type cast character they play so well.  This move is not going to be one of the hallmark films for the genre either, as the original \\"Death Race 2000\\" did.  Having said all these nasty things about this film, why did I watch it?<br />It is good mindless fun!  The standard story of a stoic hero railroaded by evil business people working for faceless corporations can accommodate another action flick.  The acting is good enough, the hero is heroic, the villains are pure evil, the eye-candy is excellent and the action sequences are very very well done!  This is a kick off your shoes, loosen your belt, turn off your mind and enjoy yourself!  Within that frame, this is a fun way to waste two hours in mindless entertainment.

B0001AP12G|4.0|This is classic Kanye right here! Along with \\"Graduation\\", this is one hell of a hip hop album. This one mostly deals with social issues, religion, the workplace, family matters, etc. These are pretty unusual subjects in the world of rap nowadays: the only modern-day rap album I can think of that mostly doesn't deal with girls and money and f**k-the-police ramblings is \\"Release Therapy\\" by Ludacris. The songs themselves are catchy and intriguing. \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"Family Business\\" are just two of the most lovable songs that are found here. \\"Spaceship\\" and \\"Through the Wire\\" have some good beats and music overall. But songs like \\"Last Call\\" and \\"Get 'Em High\\" don't seem to work; they don't have compelling melodies to start with, and the music is a bit irritating.<br /><br />As you can see, \\"808s and Heartbreak\\" shows a very different Kanye. Here, we should cherish the vintage sound that defined Kanye in the mid 2000's.<br /><br />Grade: A-

0691131511|3.0|For readers who enjoy history this is a fascinating subject since the  empire ruled so much of civilization for about a millenium.  The writing is not a dry, chronological recitation of events from Constantine to the end but individual aspects of Byzantium are presented, e.g., chapters on Eunuchs, Life at Court, Economy. This is good but it means that the names of various emperors and empresses keep getting reintroduced with each topic and it becomes impossible to keep track or even try.  I found myself skipping pages.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Great movie,arrived on time, no skips or distortions, family kind of movie for all to see. Great for a night at home.
0307455874|5.0|This book came on time, there was no problem at all, and it was a good price and I am a completely satisfied customer. I would use this service and again and recommend it to anyone.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|This CD is one of my favorite CD's.  I just recently got into All That Remains and I think they are an awesome band.  This Cd is my favorite by them, and I am looking forward to their next one.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|I love this album.  I first heard it in a little speakeasy bar in Chicago and I fell in love with it.  It's great for those mornings when you're just waking up and you want to sit down with a cup of coffee and stare out of the window at the freshly fallen snow.  It's perfect even for those lazy Sundays where it seems all too appropriate to make blueberry pancakes at 4pm-- you know, just because.<br /><br />It's a great Wintery album with a hint of Spring towards the end.  It's peaceful but yet it pulls at you from somewhere deep within, making you want you swoon with him. It is a musical diary of a heartbroken man.<br /><br />And it is glorious.
0316017922|5.0|The Outlier was outstanding.  Very well written and it shows what really causes success and it's really not what you would think.  I recommend it to anyone in business and anyone who is raising children
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|The acting and singing was TERRIBLE!!! but the girl on the cover is such an amazing singer. I'll buy her album, but the other well known actors should not have gotten their parts. They were sooo bad. And what was with having some guy (Mr. Darcey) being gay in the movie? Must Hollywood include some gay character in every movie nowadays? How distasteful! Hope there will be a remake, because that didn't do it for me.
B000002UZ1|5.0|Great CD's!  Bought for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He loves them!
B000068VHS|5.0|I don't really want to spend time doing this. It was a gift, guess it's good.
B0015OKWL2|5.0|I missed out on \\"Righteous Kill\\" in theaters, finally I got the chance to watch it on DVD!<br /><br />It's a good movie, a great cop drama and has a outstanding cast as you know. Deniro, Pacino, John Leguizamo, Donnie Walhberg, Brian Dennehy, Carla Gugino (Sin City), 50 Cent / Curtis Jackson as \\"Spider\\" and even a cameo apperance by Rob Dyrdek of MTV's \\"Rob & Big\\", who plays \\"Rambo\\" the pimp......<br /><br />Deniro was good, not amazing by any means, he seems to be coasting through as usual in most of his newer movies, Al Pacino was outstanding, his characters are always very believable, John Leguizamo played his character well, as always and Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson also did a good job, so far his acting seems to be worthwhile!!!<br /><br />The movie has alot twists throughout, the ending is excellent, the way they set up the twist at the end was unusual, but it definitely worked and most people won't see it coming!<br /><br />Good cop action / drama!!!!
B000000OF6|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  It has a lot of really great songs on 2 discs.
0790733226|1.0|Contact is quite possibly the worst movie that Jody Foster or Matthew Mcconaughey have ever done. In all fairness, this should be a 2 1/2 or 3-star film, but the utterly appalling ending removes any possible enjoyment.  Many other reviews have summed up the plot, so I see no reason to restate it here. What is so ghastly about the movies' conclusion is the premise that an intelligent, well-educated, experienced SCIENTIST; upon meeting an alien species is reduced to \\"faith\\" to explain what happened. I was almost physically ill. Faith is the ENEMY of science. It denies reason, ignores evidence, and accepts no criticism. To suggest that a scientist would throw away logic and reason in some sort of quasi-religious epiphany is not just stupid, it's insulting.   Do not buy this. Do not watch this.   Watch Star Wars instead. It's far more entertaining, and far less insulting to your intelligence.
B001GJOL22|5.0|I only own one blu-ray and this is the one. great sound, great visuals, all of the new songs are awesome. this was filmed in the Netherlands. I wasn't a big fan of Rush growing up, but now I am. I feel they are better now. Getty Lee's voice sounds incredible. Neal Peart is in great shape and really is the best drummer of all time. I love the part in Spirit of Radio when he says concert hall. I felt like I was there. the best music on video ever, hands down!
B0017IKR7K|5.0|This is a great CD - I got it for my boyfriend and he loves it.
0545128285|2.0|Both my wife & I are fans of the Harry Potter & both of us agree this is by far the worst book of the series.  It seems J.K.Rowling had some pretty good short stories but then slapped tons in inconsequential information on the end of the stories as filler.  I really don't recommend buying this. Instead just go to the library & check it out.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|This is one of the best pictures I have seen.  The music is fantastic, the actors are wonderful!  Even our 5 year old granddaughter loves this movie.  Highly recommended to everyone!
B0015AARJI|5.0|What I love about PS3 is that it's a game console as well as a Blu Ray DVD player.  Also, the graphics is very detailed and clear. It's definitely worth every Penny!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This collection of wonderfully peaceful and touching songs proves that she can still make classics to be enjoyed for many years to come.  Very Good.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|An absolutely superb series showing the trails and tribulations our founding fathers endured for us to be where we are today. Highly recommended.
1400067936|4.0|Learned, irreverent and no-nonsense ex-option trader N. Taleb enumerates instances where people, experts and non-experts alike, make mathematically unsound statements about a probabilistic reality and cites biological and social reasons for such fallacies.    Taleb mentions some seemingly outrageous points, such as calling some renowned experts intellectual charlatans and suggesting a higher attribution of the success of prominent business figures to luck rather than skills. He wants the readers to realize how little they have attributed randomness to outcomes of their and others' actions.    Another interesting point is survivorship bias.  This appears to be a common trap people walk into when drawing a conclusion on a phenomenon.  For instance, an observation such as \\"bankers make a lot of money\\" fails to recognize the many professionals that start out in the banking business and flunk out; these professionals are incorrectly excluded from the sample, hence the biased observation.    Nassim lists many examples of smart-sounding but mathematically idiotic statements made by journalists (especially them), economists, and finance practioners. I find myself more acute to observing these statements in mass media and casual conversations.    The reasons for these dumb statements, as Taleb points out, can come from that emotions are an integral part of our being.  Emotions are important because they allow us to find shortcuts and make quick decisions on-the-fly, which allows for efficiency and quick reaction in times of danger.  Emotions allow us to survive.  Unfortunately emotions are also often deterrents to rational behavior.  The financial markets and information age have experienced an explosive pace of growth, and our cerebral development has been lagging behind this progress.  That is why when trading financial products people could behave irrationally simply because our genes are prone to such shortcut-finding behaviors.    The mathematical mind will find this book less intriguing than many simply because someone that has received proper training in probability will have probably uncovered many of the fallacies committed by people that surround them.  Nonetheless the more math-inclined crowd will still benefit greatly from subtle points such as the fact that humans use a brain of rigor and a brain of shortcuts to deal with different types of tasks, therefore making some of our behaviors irrational.    Financial practitioners will like Taleb's strategy of benefiting from financial tail-risk. Although not explicitly stated, the author seems to believe that asset return distributions are not necessarily normal; these distributions could have very fat tails. Because this point is not being taken to heart by many market participants, the author thinks these fat tail events are priced cheap and try to take advantage of them. This could be an interesting strategy to think about.    Finally, Taleb cites many interesting sources, from history books to neuroeconomics studies to financial mathematics works. I find the section for reading recommendations itself a great resource.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckart, Gary Oldman, and more, all directed by Christopher Nolan? what more do you need? this movie was great, i had to see it twice in theaters, and it was just common sense to buy the dvd. with the digital copy and special editions- its awesome, and a great value!
B00197POXG|5.0|This is a mammoth undertaking of 42 DVD's with more than 120 recorded hours.  It was purchased as a birthday gift and true to their word, Amazon had it to us in two days despite being ordered during the height of the Christmas shipping season.  The recipient is delighted and has enjoyed it daily since it arrived December 15th.  It plays well on a new Magnavox ZV450MW8 VCR/DVD recorder with digital tuner, but some disks have glitches when played on a bargain DVD player.  The DVD's contain multiple episodes and in a few of them, we couldn't play the second and third episode on the $29 DVD player.  As I said, this problem did not occur on the newer equipment.  It's disconcerting only because the problem is intermittent; it does not occur across all the disks, but only on some of them.  The set includes all six seasons and both full length movies, and anyone who was a fan when the series aired will find this well worth the investment. I'd forgotten the attention to historical detail and the recurring themes supportive of traditional family values.  It's something we'll be sure to point out to our infant children as they grow into their formative years.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The product was rapidly received!  DVD was on great condition as stated by the seller!
B001GM28HO|5.0|Lady Gaga's album brings out my materialistic side which i already had ironically lol. I love this cd it rocks! Virtually every song is a hit, and is so catchy and I love that she writes all of her lyrics. She's amazing, I love everything about her, the music, the lyrics, the look, the sound EVERYTHING!!! Defintely get this album! Every single track is amazing!
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens as a 'walk around' lens and it does the job superbly. Solid construction. The macro function works nicely as well. It is tack sharp and focuses fast. The IS is a great feature and sure helps old shaky guys like me!! For a mid priced walk around it just doesn't get any better than this lens. You can't go wrong with it.
0439023483|4.0|The story is of a girl who trades places with her little sister to join in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are a type of mandadory survival game where only one of 24 teens (between the ages of 12-18) will walk away.     The book has elements of adventure, survival, growth and love. I'm an adult and I enjoyed reading the Hunger Games. It was recommended to me when I needed another book to replace Twilight and I enjoyed it almost as much. Can't wait for the sequel.
1400079179|3.0|OK - but not too well written or plotted. For a parallel conspiracy and more depth - try:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1409221296 Dark Windows]]

B000002QWD|5.0|Love this CD.  It's a great album for background music while entertaining.  It doesn't get annoyingly chaotic as do some other Christmas albums when you're trying to carry on conversations.
0385340990|5.0|\\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is a very refreshing way to see a small piece of WWII history without getting bogged down in the dark violence of the era.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This DVD is very high quality. There are a ton of bonus features. Very good DVD. I would recommend it to everyone!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Worst movie ever, its as simple as that. I seen the movie when it first came out in theaters. I went with a large group of friends, needless to say it but not only did our whole group hate the movie but all the people in the theater as well. Many people booed it through out the movie. I mean come on a camera that has a batteriy that can last an entire night and that can servive several drops and being chewed up and dropped out of the monsters mouth. I would love a camera that tuff. To bad non exist. And as for the military in the movie, maybe its just the fact that having served in the military that i critisize movies different then civilains do because i have knowledge of weapons, tactics, and capabilitys. This was by far the worst movie with the military in it. Even worse then starship troopers 2! Also the acting was poor and there was no plot to it, no background. I was half expecting, half hoping Godzilla would jumpout from behind a building and kill this monster. When the movie was over and everyone was leaving we all complained about it as we passed everyone waiting in line to buy tickets and we ended up taking over half the line away! From hearing what we had to say about it. The line was well over a hundred people! LOL, I just hope jj abrams dosnt screw up The next star trek movie. If i could give this movie a negative rating i would. This is a movie i would not watch if there was nothing but infomercials on tv. DO NOT SEE IT PERIOD!!!
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|This review will be very short.  \\"Mamma Mia\\" is a fine movie, but do me a favor, please find/buy/rent a copy of \\"Muriel's Wedding\\" wedding (heck, even look at the cover of the DVD first and you'll see what I mean).<br /><br />The common theme here seems to be (some of) the music of Abba.<br /><br />4 stars for Mamma Mia<br />4 stars for Muriel's Wedding<br /><br />Be warned, Muriel's Wedding is 'different' as Australian comedies go...
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Coldplay's music is so bland & trite.  It's such boring, predictable cliche music.  Coldplay's music is always seriously lacking in creativity.  Coldplay's technical ability & physical talent with what they can perform on their instruments is always worth a good laugh in the morning.  I like to laugh about Coldplay's lack of talent while I'm drinking coffee in the morning & reading the morning newspaper, I usually am reading the \\"Coldplay sucks\\" section.  It's always a good read in the morning to see what's sucking with Coldplay today.  Coldplay's music made me quit listening to the radio.  Coldplay's music is really terrible all the time.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|This is the most entertaining \\"chick flick\\" that I have ever seen.  My wife saw it twice on the big screen before she convinced me to go see it. The acting is great and the songs seductive, even though the plot calls for suspending your credulity.  This is one DVD that can be played and enjoyed multiple times.  The cast appears to be having fun throughout, and this definitely a mood lifter.  I recommend this DVD highly.
006135323X|5.0|Predictably Irrational is a compelling psychology book, with a slight behavioral economics slant, by Dan Ariely. It is written in layman's terms about why humans behave irrationally in certain situations, but systematically irrational so that we are rather predictable. If Mr Spock or the android Data from the Star Trek series had read this book, they would neither have been as puzzled nor intrigued by us as a species.<br /><br />In the book, Dan explored many simple and common situations we can all relate to in life. This practical aspect of it was the book's major draw for me. Among situations covered were:<br /><br />  * The impact \\"free\\" has on us;<br />  * Our procrastination with deadlines;<br />  * The magnitude to which arousal destroys our ability to think;<br />  * How we order food/drink relative to those who ordered before us, pending what we are trying to demonstrate to those around us rather than thinking independently<br />  * How we cheat, but only enough to gain slightly, though not if we just had a little reminder of honesty in some ways beforehand (like a silly request to think of as many of the 10 commandments as we can), etc.<br /><br />The commonality of the situations Dan chose to discuss in the book means you can pick them up to use them. I just hope you use it either for awareness to catch yourself from the same follies, or to watch others for their \\"humanity\\" rather than to take advantage of them like salespeople probably have done to you and I. These human \\"follies\\" in our daily lives and in consumer behaviour are also why the field of economics is going down the drain to be replaced by behavioral economics, as Dan also explains. Economics were made for logical beings, which have always led me to declare that economics are for Vulcans, not humans!<br /><br />The examples the author cited are backed up by a lot of studies, some large and some a little small for my liking. However, in the latter, I found I was not surprised by the conclusions so I didn't doubt them. I also found myself on the end of some of those conclusions, as I'm sure most people would. We are all humans, after all, and by the end of the book, you will also find out we are all predictably irrational.<br /><br />Save a copy in the library for whenever Spock and Data come along, eh?<br /><br />p.s. Dan Ariely has a great blog for which you can enjoy more of his writings here. Continued support for a book, to keep on writing and expanding it, seems to be the way of the future... a rather irrational concept not that long ago but one which is becoming predictably irrational.nd myself on the end of some of those conclusions, as I'm sure most people would.

B001GKJ2E8|3.0|Wanted is an action flick about a guy named Wesley who leads a decidedly ordinary life as a walking doormat until a woman named Fox (Angelia Jolie) saves him from an assassin! He then learns that he was destined for more than he originally thought as he was the son of an assassin that was murdered by one of his own. Now, he seeks revenge but learns there is more to it than he originally thought!    James McAvoy is good as Wesley and Morgan Freeman plays a slightly different character than what we are used to seeing out of him! He even splits out some language in this one! A bit shocking since he usually plays the moral compass in most movies he's in.    As for Angelina Jolie, she was okay in this one. Not the best but certainly not her worst role. We do, however, get a surprise nude scene in this one. Usually, Angelina teases it but never actually shows. In this one, well, let's just say we get a peak at what Brad Pitt gets to enjoy! LOL!    Overall, it was a good film. About the level of the first XXX with Vin Diesel back in 2002 in that it won't win any Oscars but you can do worst things to waste a Saturday afternoon. Worth a rental or buy at a reduced price.
B000002GBK|5.0|This particular album is one of Rick Wakeman's finest works. Although it was regarded in the mid '70's as a colorful spoof with mediocre quality, I must thoroughly disagree. In studying the themes and contrapuntal texture, not to mention the addition of a stylized classical rock mixture, this album should be re-released and marketed for a new generation of music connoisseurs that appreciate true musical talent and not merely a beat with clever words thrown in. Guinevere is my favorite track as well.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Movie was good and entertaining.  Blu-ray is nice but does not live up to the media.  More of a selling campaign.  Just give us a digital copy on flash drives.
B001GQ2TGA|2.0|If you're an Enya fan, you'll probably like a couple of the songs on the album. However, the remainder are so similar in composition to previous albums, there is no \\"flavor\\" so to speak. It's like getting an exciting new flavor of chewing gum...chew on it for about half an hour and the flavor has dulled to the point that it is merely for the sake of chewing that you got any enjoyment out of it at all. While I truly love the harmonal quality and precise treatment of the compositional structure, perhaps only 1 or 2 songs actually made the album worth the price. The rest, I believe, were injecting trite and overly-used themes from days gone by. Enya should try re-inventing a new music style or product line...it's getting tired.
B001ECQ75A|3.0|When I started this movie, I expected a simple children's film with cardboard characters and half-rate animation. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised on most counts.    I don't know why people ranked this film's animation below Pixar's. Character designs are well done and colors are on the mark. Just the first section of Kung Fu Panda has a wonderfully stylized dream sequence full of delightful color, movement, and humor. Fight sequences are exciting and entertaining -- bizarre, really, when you realize you're looking at a bunch of anthropomorphic animals doing impossible things (impossible things that look strangely possible!). Emotion is effortlessly imparted on each character's face -- even through such small things as their eyes and simple shifts in their postures. There are many frames in this movie that could be turned into a picture on the wall (Oogway's ascension, the Tigress leaping past the moon). Face it -- you can't give Pixar all the credit in the animation biz.    The humor is varied between jokes at Po's expense to slapstick. It's juvenile humor, to be sure; the kiddos will adore it, but it's unconventional enough to pull a chuckle or two out of adults. Po training with dumplings was nothing short of a laugh a minute.    The characters themselves are actually a bit more complex than what I expected. Po is a sweet, good-natured protagonist who I really rooted for; Jack Black does an excellent job as his voice actor. The Master Shi-Fu (voiced by Hoffman) has a surprising past that left a tear in my eye, as does villain Tai Lun. The Furious Five are the only rather \\"flat\\" characters, only because they have less screen time.    The downside is the very formulaic story, which rushes forward at the speed of a bullet train, and its simple, fortune-cookie Chinese philosophy. There's nothing wrong with it, per se; but it's just not that striking and it's nothing you haven't heard before. It's ultimately what makes this film forgettable afterward.    This filmis a fast-paced, enjoyable diversion that should be fun for kids and adults alike. Just don't expect to come back to it over and over unless you're below the age of 10.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|I'm not sure if I agree with the blurb on the DVD cover about this being \\"the best vampire movie ever,\\" but if Terrance Mallick was Swedish and decided to make a vampire/suspense movie starring two tweens it might've come out like this film. So much is communicated without language in this film. 'Let the Right One In' quiet and slow paced yet never tedious. The cinematography & directing are both equally beautiful and unsettling, and the performances by the two child leads are compelling throughout.
B00001OH7N|5.0|It came fast and I love this album.  Listened to it all the way to California for christmas.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I have always liked this series, but the tin is a real nice effect.  Great product, great price.
0449000729|3.0|I liked this book because I enjoy historical fiction.  Some sections were better than others, but many sections seemed like a recitation of known events (kind of like some of Michener's lesser works, eg Poland).  Still, I enjoyed it and don't regret buying it.  I've also received The Forest as a gift and will look forward to reading that soon.  I particularly liked his handling of how families/family names morphed over time in Sarum.
B00006ZSAD|5.0|I'm a big Portishead fan but I found myself wanting more of Beth Gibbons, more of her voice, more of her style without the occasionally hysterical, over dramatic Portishead beats a la Geoff Barrows. 'Out of Season' really hit the spot. Adrian Utley, a Portishead member, is present on guitar but he is pleasantly complementary, accenting Beth Gibbon's voice and lyrics perfectly.     Even if I did not speak English I'm sure I would understand the spirit and the intent of each and every one of these songs because Beth Gibbons is truly a vocal and lyrical genius with an almost uncanny ability to capture an incredibly wide range of emotions.     'Show' is probably one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. \\"Let the show begin/It's a sorry sight/Let it all deceive\\" was running through my head every so often during the US presidential elections lol.
1559277734|5.0|I loved these stories when I read them many years ago, but reading time is harder to come by these days.  Christopher Timothy does as good a job reading as he did in the BBC series!  Great for long trips, while sewing, etc .. any fan would enjoy this, or anyone who loves animals, or anyone interested in human nature (Herriot is a great observer of people).
B00139W3NE|5.0|A great adventure film, heroic and set in a land that is enough like our own world to resonate but with differences that make the heart leap in wanting them. Yes, I want a daemon!  If you have read the book recently, then dont watch the film yet, because you will be annoyed by the (mostly necessary) changes they have made to make it fit the limited time. Watch the film first, then read the books which have so much more to them, but the imagery of the film definitely enhances your imagination when you read. The child actors are simply brilliant, not sappy or sweet. But the best is the armoured bear.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|Nothing special here. I bought Viva La Vida and really liked that album so I bought this for more Coldplay. In a way you are just buying the same songs twice. There are a few new ones on here but nothing that will blow you out of the water. Lost and Lovers in Japan are pretty much the same songs but with Jay-Z and somewhat of a remix respectively. If you can buy this cheap I would recomend it but wouldn't over pay for it. For Coldplay fans it's something to add to the collection.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The Dark Knight is a masterpiece movie. The cast was like a symphony of actors. Christian Bale owns it as Batman/Bruce Wayne and again does a phenominal job. In Batman Begins he was good, in The Dark Knight he is better. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent is incredible. Harvey shows us how one set of events can completely change us and our outlook on life. Gary Oldman returns as Commisioner Gordon, a cop who is not corrupted and who is good at heart. He just makes the viewer feel like it is all going to be alright. Morgan Freeman also returns as Lucious Fox. He is a great asset to Batman/Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as Rachael Dawes. In my opinion, it made Rachael a more compassionate and relatable character. Heath Ledger as The Joker has to be one of the most memorable villains of this century. Jack Nickolson who? Heath is normally the hero or love interest.  When a person watches this, they will be like \\"Where is Heath?\\" Oh, he is in it alright! Heath Ledger is the Joker! The Dark Knight has action for the guys, love story for the girls, and a story for everybody else. This movie is a must have for comic book fans to put in their collection and for anybody who wants to watch an example of an Oscar worthy movie!

B001HPP2X2|5.0|This Showtime series stars Michael C. Hall as a sociopathic serial killer who targets only individuals he feels deserve his attention because of loopholes in the justice system.  Dexter is an expert on crime- scene blood splatters.  We often see him at crime scenes as the police and forensic experts put together how a crime was committed.      Dexter is a sullen, strange guy who does his job well but has trouble relating to people.  In Season One, we learn his backstory.  His father, sensing an unnatural desire in his son to kill, councils the boy on how to channel his feelings so that innocent people aren't harmed.  These scenes reminded me of a superhero \\"origins\\" tale.  Depending on how you look at it, Dexter is either a hero who rids society of reprehensible, murderous villains, or an elusive criminal whose killing rampage must be stopped.  One thing, however, is certain.  Dexter is very cool, and is unlike any character on television.  Hall heads a fine cast in a sort of \\"Law and Order\\" series with a touch of the Grand Guignol.  Blu-ray bonus extras include the featurettes \\"The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course\\" and \\"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation,\\" and the first episode of \\"Dexter,\\" Season Three.

1401923119|5.0|This is the new paradigm for medical science.  It is grounded in research.  It may take 20 years to mold current medical practice into this way of thinking, but it will happen.  The book is written so anyone can understand it.  Some of the science that is showcased will change or be altered with time, but this is the first time I have seen the whole of science put together in a cogent whole.  I have given it to several of my physician colleagues as gifts.

B000002KXV|5.0|One of the best CD's ever. But regarding sound quality versus the Import I must say this original 1990 version is superior and alot less expensive. Thats all I have to say about that.    Pioneer Elite - THX Certified Amp  Denon w/ Burr-Browns CD Player  Klipsch Reference Series Speakers  AudioQuest Cable
B000WZB944|5.0|This was a requested gift and seemed satisfactory.  I was pleased that since another item in the order was backordered until Dec 26 this one was mailed promptly.  Christmas presents are better on Christmas.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This series is breathtaking.  There will be a number of times when they show One-of-a-kind animals found in some cave only in waterfalls at nighttime, during a winter storm... and you'll have to wonder:  How did they get this footage?    And educational to boot!  The queasy may want to skip the insects and slimy stuff!
B001ECQ75A|4.0|This video was a Christmas gift for my Grandson. He has enjoyed viewing it repeatedly.The video arrived on the date given, packaged well and in good condition.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We bought this for our soon to be 4 month old daughter before she was born. This was money well spent. It is loud enough for her to hear, but not too loud that it keeps her awake. The Rainforest sounds are very soothing. I also like the little remote that comes with it so we can restart it if need be w/out going over to her crib and disturbing her. (once she sees us it's game over and she wants held) I strongly recommend this product.
0061537934|5.0|[[ASIN:0061537934 The Art of Racing in the Rain]]  After hearing a recommendation for this book on NPR,I ordered it from Amazon.  I began reading it right from the package and did not put it down more than briefly until the last page.  Enzo became a friend as well as the narrator.  His philosphy of life and his frustration with a tongue that inhibits talking along with the absence of opposable thumbs are engaging.  I gave the book to my brother, also a lover of dogs and racing cars, who immediately read it and passed it on to another friend.  Get it, read it and pass it on.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I think this DVD is pretty good. There are 3 workouts that go from beginner to advanced. Each workout is about 25 minutes including warm up and cool down. I like to do 2 of the workouts in a row to really get the sweat pouring. But if I'm short on time, then 1 workout is okay (better than nothing). Jillian does a good job of modifying the moves for beginners and really shows how to get the more advanced participants' hearts pumping. I think it's a good DVD to have on hand in case you can't get to the gym or as part of a collection of various exercise DVDs. It'll give you a good workout, but might get a little boring if you really do it for 30 days straight.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall E<br />Much like Douglas Sirk disguised his social problem films as family melodramas, Wall E, A somewhat silent film that deals with current issues facing humanity such as the environment, hyper consumerism, Mcdonaldization, and a side effect the obesity epidemic is disguised  as a cute animated family film.  Sirk disguised his films so the Production Code Administration would allow the films to be viewed by the public now Wall E has to trick the public looking for escapist unchallenging cinema into possibly thinking deeper.<br />Ironically if this future vision held true Wall E himself would be collecting mass produced Wall E merchandising on Earth while children onboard the space resort play the Wall E video game.
B000050IL0|5.0|How can i write, How can i describe my feelings.    One man spending his whole life through music, became music itself, and another man, after 250 years later, spent all his life through to understand and play 1st mans music.    Both of them were perfectionists, both of them were genius. One is God kind, other is prophet kind.     Glenn Gould has spend all his life playing Bach's contrapuntal music. He said once in a time '' I could not live without that music.'' He was also a pioneer in recording history. At least 50 years ago, he had seen the future, the recordings importance.     He started his carrier with Goldberg Variations recording, his deput recording, when he was his 20 ties. 30 years later, whom he was a man that not re-record his repertoire, his major exception was the Goldberg's.    I think that decision was his rightest decision of his life. If you watch this dvd, at the beginning, his speech about why he re-record Goldberg's, ''Stereo, breaking of consistency, etc.'' he accept the truth a little. His first recording was perfect in technically, but he was not ready for understanding the deepness of the Old-Grand Master's mega hit.    We do not know, for which reason Golberg Variations had composed. Some said that, Bach composed it for an old rich man, a Prussian -old Germany- ambassador, which had sleeping problems. Yet Goldberg's give soul a real peace and relief, -you can simply go to sleep when you are listening some of the variations, at the end- we never sure about that.    The score was perfect, variations are unique. And the most important is the order itself. Bach started his score with a simple Aria, just and only music, I think the best only music of all time, no one composed better than this. Than every kind of variation came, to the very end, we are at the higher levels, at 29th variation, the heavy metal of Bach, one of the heaviest of all time, then 30th variation, a theme from a folk song, we relieved again.    Like life itself, we againcome to our starting point, the simple and the best, ''simple is the best always'' Aria, more slowly, we closed our lives with simple music. And only music, only sounds stay after live.. only music survives.    wauv,    What a score. Glenn Gould understood this, at his top height of maturation, he understood. With his all lifetime experience with Bach music, with contrapuntal music. His all technical power, his all abilities, he gave us all, at this recording.    Remember that, he played this piece at least 45 years, from his little child hood he played Goldbergs. This was the end, this was the best. Not best of his, best of all time. No one, in the humanity, in the history of mankind can play it better. He gave us all his life experience, with his companionship with Bach, he gave us simply the perfect.    (never forget, some variations has taken 30 or more times, to get absolute perfectness. This is what Glenn Gould is, this is what Bach's music is.)    If you ever listen Bach's mature perfect works from different recordings. You can easly see that, in every recording musicians can go further, improve their quality. This one is the only exception I have ever heard, only the one.     Thanks a lot for Bruno Monsangion for his directing, using his cameras at different angle, thanks the soul of the video.     Glenn Gould, I will always love you, this is the video, which changed my life completely. If there is heaven, if there is God -which i think not- you are with him, there, next to Bach himself, playing and making music for him.    If you ever like listen music, if you ever listen a music piece once in your life, please buy this video. No other recording in the all music history can be better than this. This is special, just buy it for yourselves, at midnight after every other people go to bed, open your player, put the disk inside player, and watch it.    You will understand me then. No more to speak, just silence.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|This is a great movie. Full of emotion; pain, happiness, loss...A movie in which you grow to love the character (Tess) and can even relate to her feelings. A touching, moving film. Not such a happy ending, but that is so in some lives. I love it the whole way through.
0062515675|5.0|I found this book to be one of the most profound books I've read. It offers such simple yet stirring words of wisdom. This book has inspired not only myself but my friends who I've lent it to, to make the changes in our lives to become better people. To quote one of my favorite passages in the book, \\" We are all here for some special reason. Stop being a prisoner of your past. Become the architect of your future.\\" It's words like that coupled with simple exercises and advice that truly gets you motivated to go out and achieve the best that life has to offer. I highly recommend this book.
B001GQACGO|1.0|I am very hurt with this CD especially after B-day. This Cd is just horrible to listen to. It just doesnt hold my attention or make me wanna listen to it. There are only 2 songs that I like and that is Single Ladies and IF I was a Boy. The rest is just pure trash and I wish I could demand my money back.<br /><br />Beyonce...WHAT HAPPENED??
B00140PK6O|5.0|Sadly I had only caught bits & pieces of this series since it first aired on British television - but luckily I got the DVD for Christmas!<br /><br />What a fantastic series, with truly interesting and engaging characters, and genuine laughs.  It's just a shame it's not longer!  Five episodes is just not enough!  I can't believe John Adams beat this out at the Golden Globes - Cranford is 100 times more thoughtful, touching, and engaging than that dry old lump of a miniseries.<br /><br />I can't say a bad thing about this series except my cousin (30 year old male) caught part of it and said he couldn't watch any more chattering ladies, it was driving him crazy.
1416511946|5.0|I knew that rock stars did drugs and drank but I never knew to what lengths. This really opened my eyes to the inner struggle that these guys and girls in the rock world got through. I would recommend this highly to anyone who has ever loved rock n roll.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|I realize I am in the minority.<br /><br />The way I approached this series as nothing more than a viewer who loves historical dramas - both true to life and fictional accounts.<br /><br />Well, I was excited when this series came into our house.  I was really psyched when I watched the first episode - and then... the second... and ... oh god, now I gotta watch the third... ... do we have to watch the fourth? ...you know, frankly it started to feel like a chore.  And I have \\"better\\" things to do than to torture myself watching Paul Giamatti huffing, puffing, and bugging his eyes out in exasperation for - what is it - 6, 9 hours? - he got a golden GLOBE for that?!?! ... *sigh*
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I bought this CD for my Boss.  I have the song Mercy on my Ipod and when he heard it he loved it and talked about it all the time so I gave it to him for Christmas and he plays it in his office alot.  I haven't heard any complaints from him about it and he knows the whole CD now.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|In the movie Walt explains to someone, \\"I fix things.\\"  He comes from an era where we took care of what we had and made it last. We honored things that were well made and the people who made them.      Walt's biggest problem with his neighbors is what he sees as their failure to take care of their things.  When he discovers that they honor their traditions the way he honors his, he is finally able to see the good in them. Earning Walt's trust is difficult, but once you do, you have the kind of ally that everyone hopes for.    I really liked this movie in the same way I liked Paul Newman in \\"Nobody's Fool.\\" It wasn't so much the action in the story as it was the telling of it. Clint wears this role as comfortably as Paul Newman wore his.  Again it is about craftsmanship.  If you honor well made things, you will enjoy this movie.

0517548232|5.0|Broken into a series of highly understandable chapters written in clear English covering different economic fallacies, Economics in One Lesson explains the big picture of government interventions. By discussing what would have occurred in the absence of these interventions, as well as the true total costs, Hazlitt makes arguments we rarely hear elsewhere these days.    Bad economic policy matters. Realities can not be ignored or papered over with more bad policy. We can not spend ourselves out of debt. We can not pile up massive debts to be passed on to future generations. This book explains why.    If high level policy makers in Congress and the Executive read this book, they could stop being clueless literally overnight. As we are poised for a 21st century version of \\"The New Deal,\\" this book is more timely than ever. Read it. Share it. Buy copies for friends and family!

B001H5X7I4|4.0|That said, I did find this film mildly entertaining, though I won't blast it.<br /><br />Tom Cruise pushed the envelope on total silliness -- I didn't even recognize him as the evil producer. WOW!<br /><br />Making a movie about making a movie, with character actors who are suppressing their comedic and Stallone-type roots to make a Vietnam flick and get thrown into a real jungle environment, being hassled by agents and heroin gun-toting criminals -- and a 12 year old running the whole operation -- not family friendly to say the least.<br /><br />The fake trailers at the start were hilariously funny -- especially the Toby MacGuire Satan's Alley at a theater near you.<br /><br />Jack Black tries way too hard to be funny to a point of not being funny -- although his faked films were indeed to be desired -- leaving, much.<br /><br />Stiller running across an exploding bridge, guts spilling out and head gore were a bit much -- but you can't fault them for creativity.<br /><br />My DVD had lots of extras, making-of, and interviews with Robert Downey Jr. (who threw out the comment that Ironman was going to be a trilogy -- say what?)<br /><br />If you like a fresh take on satire, check this one out -- but as a rental.<br /><br />More Stiller films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00049QLV4 Ben Stiller Collection (Meet the Parents - Special Edition/Mystery Men/Reality Bites/Along Came Polly)]]

8489367116|5.0|If I had liked nothing except the writing in this book, I would have loved the book and recommended it to many friends.  I was especially fascinated that construction companies 'build\\" a slum before they hire the workers for a big construction job.  The workers families join them after the work begins.  I guess my ignorant impression was that a slum was something that just happened, and not a community.  Roberts writes beautifully, and Prabaker's happy English added greatly to my enjoyment of the book.  I know the old expression \\"live and learn,\\" but Shantaram invites you to \\"read and learn.\\"
0307454894|4.0|This is the story of a woman (Hanna) who once committed an unforgivable crime, but who nevertheless receives lifelong love and devotion from a boy (Michael) who she seduced when he was only fifteen.  This story isn't for prudes, even though the sex in the book isn't graphic.  Rather, you can't be the type to shy away from the darker side of human nature and still appreciate the truth and beauty of this novel.  Usually when evil is shown in popular books and movies, it takes an exaggerated, almost comic oppositional tone (ex: Hannibal Lector).  So rare is it to find that the true face of evil can be not only attractive, but sympathetic.  Bernhard Schlink makes us understand and care for Hanna, because we only see her through Michael's eyes.  We know intellectually that she was evil (especially at the end, when the survivor he encounters states \\"she really was a brutal woman\\"), but we don't want to believe that any more than he does.  Schlink's book was written to explore the moral qualms experienced by second generation Germans struggling to reconcile their parents' roles in the Holocaust, but I found the individual, human elements of this very honest love story even more compelling than the political issues the writer linked them to.
045122499X|3.0|I liked PoE so much I  was  thrilled  to  pick WWE up.   And I  never  felt any anxiety at  all about  the  ending... just  as  before.  In fact  I sort of feel  you could substitute in a bridge for a cathedral and the book would  write  itself.  The  books, to me, are about 80%  the same.      I  liked it but... some new relationship models  could  help.  Not much growth here over  all  these years of waiting for this book to come out.

The BlueRay version is particularly spectacular both in animation and in scenery.

I started reading it right then and there and just took it all in.<br /><br />My only complaint...way too short! I finished within an hour or so and was left wanting more fairy tales from the wizard world. Each story has a nice lesson to teach, even to us muggles.<br /><br />Pick it up and enjoy another glimpse into Harry Potters' world!!

B001DHXT20|4.0|Hulk dvd did not give Hulk enough talking lines. I expected more. The Hulk character is 5 stars awesome. Not the right kind of action or enough.  The Hulk does have some human side and should show some intelligence of the science person having control at times. If the story line and adventure parts had something more it would help.
1416585710|5.0|I think the problem many people have with this book is that much of it is recollection and nowadays, people just don't have the attention spans to delve too deeply into a multilevel story like this. I found this book plenty scary because it dealt with the horrifying things that can happen in a family..I felt so badly for Scott as a child, because it struck a chord in me...I've dealt with someone you love most of all hurting you the most.<br /><br />I liked the special phrases that popped up in the book, because every family has it's own little quirks, inside jokes,culture and language.<br /><br />I almost didn't read this because so many people gave it a bad review. Just goes to show that we should always take reviews by others with a grain of salt. I loved this book and it intrigued me almost as much as his Darktower series.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Awesome movie...if you like this type.  Visual affects and story is much different, but GOOD for today viewers of this type of super hero.

B001GCUNVW|5.0|A Simon and Garfunkel song of the 1960s called \\"The Boxer\\" tells the story of a washed-up fighter who responds to his life with determination and fortitude. After the singer recounts the humiliations he has faced in and outside of the boxing ring, the song concludes: \\"I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains./ I am leaving but the fighter still remains.\\"<br /><br />This new movie, \\"The Wrestler\\" has much of the grittiness of the Simon and Garfunkel song as it tells of a character who must follow his chosen path at all costs. Among other things, the movie also reminded me of the tough, shabby yet intense world of the underground writer Charles Bukowski. In the 1980s, Mickey Rourke, who has the lead role in this movie played Bukowski's alter ego Henry Chinanski in an adaptation of Bukowski's short story \\"Barfly\\".<br /><br />Most of the time, people need to stay within themselves to give their lives meaning. This seems to me to be the theme of \\"The Wrestler.\\"  Mickey Rourke, who has just won a Golden Globe award for his performance, plays an aging pro wrestler, Randy \\"The Ram Robinson\\". The Ram had fought a battle with a wrestler named The Ayatollah in the 1980s, but 20 years later is reduced to cheap matches in small arenas.  The Ram lives alone in a trailer park near Elizabethtown, New Jersey.  After a particularly violent match, the Ram suffers a heart attack. His doctor tells him not to fight again.  The Ram attempts to find meaning in his life apart from wrestling in a romantic involvement with an aging stripper, Cassidy (Maria Tormei), in making amends with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and in taking a day job at a deli meat counter.  Believing himself a failure in each of these three respects, The Ram returns to the life he knows: that of a pro wrestler in a rematch with the Ayatollah, even though he is aware that it could cost him his life.<br /><br />The movie has realistically effective scenes of the life of pro wrestlers, of their cameraderie and of the pain they endure even during staged matches, and of their fans. The scenes of the wrestling world are matched by the scenes in the strip club, with Cassidy in both her toughness and her vulnerability. The Ram is shown living alone in his shabby trailer, continuing his training, showing a substantial degree of introspection, and trying futily to make amends to his daughter. The characters and their environs are portrayed effectively, and both Rourke and Tomei give convincing performances.<br /><br />In addition to the Simon and Garfunkel song and to Bukowski, there are parallels to this movie in \\"Raging Bull\\" in \\"Rocky\\" and in other movies. The plot may be simple but it remains effective.  The acting and and realistic atmosphere make this movie memorable.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanand of the pain they endure even during staged matches, and of their fans.

I agree with other reviewers that some of the tones may be more interesting to older readers. As a 22 year old I could really appreciate the development of Edward and Bellas relationship, but Im not sure my 14 year old self would have been so enthused. Eclipse is still my favorite book of the series, but Breaking Dawn has definitely earned a space in my heart.

055357342X|5.0|Martin is a storyteller par excellance.     He takes a genre which is riddled with formulaic plot and characters and turns it completly upside down.     If you read fantasy novels so often that you know the beginning and end before you open the book and you are just looking for some entertainment in the middle, don't read this book!     Every chapter will astound you, confuse you and frustrate your every effort to predict the future.    In all, this book is a ride on a rollercoaster with the lights out and the seatbelt a little too loose. A blast!!

1416550518|3.0|In the winter years of her life, 98-year-old Grace looks back on her past. Bound by society's early 20th century conventions as a misbegotten child, 14-year-old Grace was sent to be a servant in the `big house' at Riverton. Fast-forward to the year 1999 - the production of a film is in progress regarding a tragic death that occurred at the house. The elderly Grace is asked to recollect any snippets of memories that would add to the film's authenticity and thus she begins to recount her memoirs of the event surrounding that time period. She also records more forthright details for her grandson; a final task she sets before herself, prior to her death.<br /><br />Footslogging at a snail-pace at the outset, any impatience will be appeased when the slow-developing plot gradually quickens, culminating in a somewhat predictable and \\"tied up neatly with a bow\\" conclusion. Worthy of note is Morton's obvious research that went into the book and her uncanny ability to evoke the past. The candid glimpse into the sub-hierarchy goings on \\"below stairs\\" in the realm of servants, butlers and maids was nothing fresh, but certainly intriguing.<br /><br />The characters failed to resonate, save the elderly narrator, Grace, who was particularly well developed. Grace, alone, had a richness, a realness, that you truly were drawn to - not merely as a geriatric caricature but as a living breathing person that you could almost touch. The ultimate \\"revelation\\" about Grace's origins wasn't a surprise. The drawn-out painstaking way this truth was realized by the lead character was irritating and detracted from the rest of the story.<br /><br />A book like this would suit someone looking for a light, but entertaining, weekend read. Think 'Remains of the Day' and 'Upstairs, Downstairs', sans remarkableness. Enjoyable, interesting, yet insubstantial - nothing that which would warrant a repeat perusal.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Woow!!... I gave this item as a gift to my girlfriend (who's more of a Beatles fan than me).

B000X5SPBI|5.0|If you're a fan of the show, I'm sure you've seen these episodes already, but for $14.99 on a \\"Black Fiday\\" sale it was well worth it. I already own seasons 1 & 2, and this was a must. Sam and Dean's characters are maturing with age, and Kripke and team are doing a great job with the stories. I'll be sad when it ends (season 5). I can't wait to buy season 4 next year. You know I'll be looking for that \\"Black Friday\\" sale though.

0767827791|2.0|I watched Picnic for the first time in decades this morning on TCM and was sad to see just how much this once favorite has dated.<br /><br />On the plus side, you've got a gorgeous, sexy and still charismatic William Holden at his peak, as the gorgeous, sexy and still charismatic loser who falls in love with Kim Novak.<br /><br />Novak is another reason why this movie was so popular back then in the mid-50s. And that slow dance they do--it's still dynamite.<br /><br />Yet, the script and the direction don't hold up.  In the big confrontation scene between Rossalind Russell and Holden, you cringe as she runs her big mouth and spits out everything venemous she can think of. And what does her long-suffering boyfriend, and Holden and Novak do?<br /><br />Nothing. They just stand there as she shrieks and vomits up all this horrific bile about the character played by Holden. He weeps and squirms and doesn't move and Novak just adopts a pained look on her pretty face and acts like a kid in school, whose teacher is shrieking to everyone what a rotten man she's in love with.<br /><br />No one tells this virago to shut up. Her boyfrind doesn't try to drag her away.  When they're alone together, she asks meekly: \\"What made me go off like that, Herb?\\" And darn, if her long-suffering soul maate doesn't just smile, hugs her and tells her beautiful she is and what pretty legs she has. Most boyfriends would have slapped her around a few times or throttled her--at least. The victim of her abuse would have screamed a few words of abuse at her. Yet, none of this happens. Everyone acts as if this is something that you expect in the world of Picnic.<br /><br />It's scenes like this one that makes the viewing of Picnic purely--for me--a visual enjoyment. We're able to catch Holden and Novak at the peak of their physical beauty.  As far as believing anything in the script, it's a waste.

While they aren't bad, the songs just aren't sung with the same passion and the quality as in the movie. Overall, I was rather disappointed. Stick with the movie and skip this CD.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I'm a guy and I don't think I've seen a movie twice in the theater since \\"The God's must be Crazy came out.  I'd been wanting to see the play of Mama Mia for a couple of years; and when the movie came out I jumped on it and ended up seeing it 5 times in our local Pharoplex. I've watched it 3 times more since I received the DVD for Christmas.  I cannot get enough of the exuberance, the joy, the singing, the incredible dancing, the humor and the talent that has been brought together in this movie.  Even Pierce Brosnan gets 5 stars for effort.  I love Mama Mia  Stanorth
B0000AR8NK|5.0|David Bowie operates like a wise merchant. His more commercial records are really advertising for the best stuff that remains mostly out of public view. \\"Reality\\" comes to us from a choice spot in the Thin White Duke's wine cellar.   I've never heard even one of the songs from \\"Reality\\" on the radio which is incredible since all of them are excellent.   My favorite is \\"Try Some, Buy Some.\\" Bowie borrows from George Harrison, using the language of commerce to invite us into love and commitment. The song shows on many levels what a savvy businessman/artist Bowie is.   This Warhol (as in Andy) spirit carries over into \\"Pablo Picasso.\\" Bowie borrows the words and images of another artist and the general culture to paint something uniquely Bowie.   He keeps going with \\"The Loneliest Guy,\\" using a cultural prop, the Internet, to show the alienating power of technology. The feigned inarticulateness Bowie employs drives the irony right between our eyes.   \\"New Killer Star\\" is a post 9/11 commentary on the obsession with novelty and the feelings of security/insecurity it brings. The penultimate line is vintage dichotomous Bowie - \\"Let's face the music and dance.\\"   \\"Never Get Old\\" is about the obsession with youth. Bowie connects unnatural expectations with the desire to escape our limits. Thus \\"The Buddha of Suburbia\\" (see other Bowie CD) brings us into the engine room of consumerist psychology -   \\"There's never gonna be enough money   There's never gonna be enough drugs   And I'm never gonna get old.\\"   Bowie ends with a reality check. You can almost hear the alarm clock of Pink Floyd's \\"Time\\" going off as Bowie finishes with incomplete sentences.   Decaying Western society and the pervasive conformism of situations like Tony Blair's government-managed \\"Cool Britannia\\" are subtext in \\"Looking for Water.\\" Bowie is soaring in irony when we surmise he's looking for life-saving drink when his native England is one of the most rain-soaked spots on Earth. It's like a Sahara traveler wishing for the comfort of soft desert sand - it's everywhere yet nowhere. It's the curse of vapid abundance and Bowie nails it.   Giving over to animal instincts is one way of reacting as Bowie informs us in \\"Fall Dog Bombs the Moon.\\" This seems to work for a time - \\"Fall dog is cruel and smart. Smart time breaks the heart...\\" but ultimately hits the wall -   \\"These blackest of years   That have no sound   No shape, no depth   No underground   What a dog.\\"   \\"She'll Drive the Big Car\\" makes for an interesting flip side to \\"Try Some, Buy Some.\\" \\"Big Car\\" is about failing marriage yet is the cause of unhappiness the fact that the woman is committed or that her commitment has waned? Like the movements of a river, it's a bit of both. Bowie tips us to this with the refrain - \\"South along the Hudson.\\"   \\"Bring Me The Disco King\\" shadow-boxes the Iraq War and the capture of Saddam Hussein. Like with most imperial adventures its roots can be found in the conqueror's domestic difficulties. In this case, George W. Bush bounced from \\"The Last Days of Disco\\" (see Whit Stillman's movie) into Christian Zionist (with a few stops in between) charging out to save the world. Unfortunately, he brought us all along for the ride. Bowie points out that the aggressor ultimately eats himself. If George is blessed then he's thinking these thoughts while waiting for his limo ride out of D.C., looking to offload some personal baggage.    \\"Killing time in the 70s   Smelling of love through moist wind   Don't let me know when you're opening the door   Close me in the dark, let me disappear   Soon there'll be nothing left of me.\\"   Conclusion:  It's good, though painful, to be alive, as Bowie tells us in \\"Days.\\" Gratitude uplifts us.   \\"These storms keep pounding through my head and heart   I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul   All the days of my life   All the days of my life   All the days I owe you.\\"
0440241030|3.0|This was my first Lee Child read and after scanning a lot of reviews I expected more. During 90% of the book I thought Reacher was a pretty boring guy. He talks big and does nothing Columbo couldn't have done, he investigates. When the action scenes finally appear it is almost a surprise because I had seen no indication Reacher had it in him. Maybe I shouldn't have started this far into the series.

They fit little bit better if I wear them behind my neck, but they are not designed for it. They are terrible to wear over your head and nothing you can adjust.<br /><br />WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.

I bought an extra copy for my hairdresser and she loves it!!!  Each song is unique and Seal \\"owns\\" them.

1582701709|2.0|\\"The Secret\\" is a compelling concept. One that is sure to attract many people looking for meaning and purpose. And I find that there are some things in this book that may actually be plausible. But the author has put so much shallowness and materialism into the idea, that I feel there is no way for any of this to be universally applicable.    The idea of carrying on with the notion that you can believe in and then ultimately attain anything goes against my personal belief about our place in the universe. We are not here to get the coolest sports car and eat the most expensive food and be the coolest guy in the gym. I can't believe that we are living for that. That kind of lifestyle will cripple our relationship with the natural world (which it already has).    How can this planet sustain with that kind of recklessness? Lets all get Hummers and everything will be okay! No way. That kind of power comes with a serious level of responsibility that needs to be observed. And I don't think the book represents that appropriately. If this secret was reality, there should be a sub title that says:    It doesn't mean you should just because you can.    I have achieved things in my life so far that I think are related to the subject of \\"The Secret\\". But these things are nothing like those put forth in the book. Intention is the word of the day here. If this stuff is real, we need to be aware of the implications.

B00169N0BK|3.0|Being an event photographer, I was thrilled when I saw the Colormunki marketing literature. It seemed I would finally be able to affordably integrate both monitor and print profiling into my workflow. I'd had recent issues with my lab prints not turning out so well do to bad lab profiles. WRONG. This package is strictly for printers DIRECTLY attached to one's computer.<br /><br />You can not print a color target and send it to your lab to create a profile. I really wish I had known about this before purchasing. I feel the marketing of this product was a bit deceptive, at a minimum. Event photographers are specifically mentioned in the literature and Xrite knows very well that the vast majority of event photographers use labs to print. Also, the literature states that RGB printers can be profiled without noting that this is limited to RGB printers DIRECTLY CONNECTED to your computer.<br /><br />The device must also be activated before you are allowed to use it. This also caused me a headache. The device kept showing up as disconnected (I was therefore unable to activate it) and it took me 24 hours of playing around and searching Xrite's site to be albe to get it to work properly. If a company deems it necessary to include 'activation', they had better make the process transparent. I don't want it getting in my way.<br /><br />As far as the profiles I was able to create, I saw no issues. The profiles are very good (but not excellent.) I can live with that as I didn't expect that at this price point I would get perfection. I now have highly accurate inkjet printer to print my billing invoices ;-)<br /><br />This package might be great for someone that does ALL printing with a locally connected inkjet, but otherwise doesn't live up to the promise of its marketing material.<br /><br />By the way, when I called Xrite on the phone to mention the above deficiencies, the tech support guy actually agreed with me, but didn't bother to offer me a refund for the product. I guess to his credit, he did say he would bring up these issues with the marketing department. Now I get to wait and see if Xrite marketing has a change of heart and decides to unshackle this otherwise good device.g up these issues with the marketing department.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|In the last 30 minutes of this epic mini-series John Adam (Paul Giamatti) viewed the famous John Trumbull's picture of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, John Adams states that he did not understand why people felt that they needed to modify history. The way it happened should be good enough (I am paraphrasing here).  That is my exact sentiment with HBO's presentation of \\"John Adams\\". Why did they need to make non-factual changes? Most of the changes were superficial to the story, but significant in the life of Adams.<br /><br />  Many of these changes are well documented by other reviewers, however some of the changes are nonsensical. For example why did they feel he need to move up Nabby's death by 11 years?  Why did they not have Nabby and Colonel Smith meet in Europe? Why did they make it appear that John and Abigail only had John Quincy accompany them to Europe (when in fact, Charles and Nabby accompanied them). Oddly enough, HBO made this is a point of contention between Charles and John... that Charles was not allowed to join John in Europe! Why change history?<br /><br />  Ok, now I will get off of my soap-box. In truth, the min-series \\"John Adams\\" was expertly done and deserves the many honors it has received. The sets and acting were phenomenal (see \\"Thomas Jefferson\\", \\"George Washington\\", and best of all \\"Benjamin Franklin\\") and true to the period. In the first chapter I was completely enthralled by the 1770's Boston. It was beyond anything that I could have imagined.<br /><br />  While I have never been a Paul Giamatti fan - he was an excellent choice for John Adams. Giamatti was able to portray both the insecurities and physical attributes nearly flawlessly (although interestingly enough they did make mistakes with his teeth as they alternated between normal and rotten).  Giamatti clearly mastered the role and embodied everything  that we would expect from Adams.<br /><br />  A note for teachers - I was disappointed in the nudity in the first and last installment. While neither were sexual in nature in my opinion \\"implied\\" nudity would have been just as effective. As it stands, neither the first nor last chapter could be used in a class room. There is also a graphic scene of Mr. & Mrs. Adams when they meet for the first time in Paris. No nudity, but it probably would not be allowed by your school's principle.<br /><br />Things that I liked about the movie<br /><br />- The portrayal of John and Abigail Adams was excellent<br />- The sets and costumes....wow<br />- Special features on the disc - make a nice commentary to the movie<br />- The portrayals of George Washington, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson<br />- The length of the mini-series - my biggest compliment to HBO is that they did not skimp and cut but embraced the entire life of John Adams<br />- The price of the DVDs - honestly this is a bargain for the amount of material that you are getting!<br /><br />Areas for improvement<br /><br />- The purposeful misrepresentation of the natural occurrence in John Adams life. I am completely clueless in why HBO did not stay true to history and David McCullough's book. This cost it a star<br />- The unnecessary nudity.<br /><br />Final verdict - Was the mini-series flawed in terms of pure history... Absolutely! Is it worth watching - YES! If this wasn't based on David McCullough's masterful biography I would rate \\"John Adams\\" as one of top 10 movies. However, since the biography drifted into fiction I have to downgrade it a bit.<br /><br />4 stars - great for those 16 and over (although most high schoolers may be bored to tears).neither were sexual in nature in my opinion \\"implied\\" nudity would have been just as effective.

B00005N6KG|4.0|Most of the other reviews were essentially correct:  They seem a bit flimsy but if you tend to be careful with your electronics it is not an issue.  The cord could be a few inches longer but I can live with it.  The important thing is they sound great and for the money it was a great deal.  Amazon got it to me quick, no muss no fuss.  Overall I'm pleased with my purchase.
068485743X|5.0|If I had to reduce my list of recommended books for fiction writers down to two books, this would be my number two book, right after [[ASIN:0060545690 Self-Editing for Fiction Writers, Second Edition: How to Edit Yourself Into Print]].<br /><br />These two books should be in every writer's library, along with The [[ASIN:0979660742 The Elements of Style: The Original Edition]].<br /><br />A new author with these books, with frayed edges, will require less editing and rewrites.

B001E7OO2I|5.0|Absolutely one of the best albums I have heard in years.  John Legend has a remarkable voice...one that will stay with you forever.  I expect this young talented man to be a household name as Marvin Gaye still is.  If you are looking for music and songs to warm your heart and lift you up...this is the album! 5 Stars!!!!

0316143472|2.0|Some stories are good, but, generaly speaking, they feel as if they were not finished, they seem like a bunch of writings that were published two years before they were ready for the public.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series is awesome and educational. I'll ask my kids if they want to watch the next episode and they'll answer \\"no\\". So, I turn it on and start watching it myself and the next thing you know all 3 of them are sitting on the couch next to me totally absorbed in the dramatic and beautiful story of nature. The blu-ray version is so life-like that you forget you're in the comfort of your home...  A nice surround-sound system helps too as the sound quality is excellent.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!!!  (I TRULY WISH THAT HEATH LEDGER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO<br />MAKE MORE MOVIES!)  IT IS MY OPINION THAT HE WAS THE GREAT STAR IN THIS MOVIE!!!
B0013V33DG|5.0|This opera and this production redefine the term \\"frothy entertaiment.\\" Dessay and her colleagues play it for laughs, but what else can you do with Donizetti's material? Don't worry about the time shifting, and don't try to impose any historical chronology on the production -- it seems vaguely set during the first world war, but were the French fighting in the Tyrol in that conflict? Not to my knowledge, though Napoleon's troops were there in 1809-10. Did Napoleon's troops have tanks? Unlikely. Don't worry, and don't expect the kinds of deep insights into humanity that you will get from the operas of Mozart, among others. Enjoy the froth and the foam, enjoy Florez and his rendition of \\"Ah, mes amis!\\" enjoy Dessay, the comedienne with a spectacular voice, and all the others.
0545128285|5.0|I really liked Beedle the Bard.  It was a quick read, but it was fun and entertaining.  I, like alot of other reviewers, would have liked it to be a little bit longer, maybe with a couple more stories or something.  But overall I really liked it.<br />Alot of people are complaining that it is a waste and doesn't add anything, it's not as long as the other HP books, etc., but really, it wasn't meant to be as long as the HP books.  It adds to the magical world that JKR created.  Like the other SMALL books, about the Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, and Quidditch Through The Ages.  Both, I believe were mentioned throughout the series, just like Beedle The Bard was in DH.  Just little things here and there that add to Harry's world.  What's so wrong with that.<br />And I like that JKR is giving the proceeds to charity.  That was a very awesome thing to do.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Big fan of Lost.  The series delivers, however, I guess due to the writer's strike, not as many episodes as in the past.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|For Paramore fans, a live DVD is one of those things we've been wanting since All We Know Is Falling first started garnering attention. Thus enters The Final Riot! Paramore's first foray into DVDs. And, for the most part, it was a rousing success.<br /><br />Taking a hint from other successful bands releasing DVDs, they include a quite thorough tour diary of sorts. Beginning with the band trying to decide what song to open the show with we get to see some pretty good arguing amongst them. Past that, its really just us following them while they tour. While there wasn't as much humor as I expected, it's still a fun 40-minute romp through Paramore's world.<br /><br />The actual show is, no doubt, what is sure to draw attention. For those of us fans who have yet to catch their live show but have heard how great they are, The Final Riot! is by far the best thing Paramore could give us. As expected though, there will always be room for setlist gripes. Major one, and the only one I'll point out, is the major lack of All We Know Is Falling material. Four out of fifteen isn't bad, but it could've been better. The inclusion of the superb b-side Decoy was great, but the biggest treat is the acoustic rendition of My Heart. I love the original for its heaviness but the acoustic version proves to be the better choice. Past that, the slow opening to crushcrushcrush, the powerful ending of Let The Flames Begin, and the awe-inspiring vocal range Hayley shows while covering Leonard Cohen's great Hallelujah, are all nice treats as well.<br /><br />Overall, fans will always have a gripe or two when it comes to concert DVDs but as for what we're given, I'm more than happy. Once again Paramore proves how much their fans mean to them, so all we can do now is wait for the new CD to be released. OR. They could release all their old b-sides for us, which are incredible. The Final Riot! is highly recommended.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I have always loved this show. This is a really great Christmas movie, the new version is just as cool.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|Okay, if you are looking at purchasing \\"Death Race\\" then you should know what to expect:<br /><br />Lots of Explosions<br />Plenty of Gunfire<br />Cool Cars<br />Bloody Violence<br />Tough Hero & Heroine<br />Viscious Villains<br />Loud Pumping Music<br />Cars crashing in Slo-Mo<br />Guns Firing in Slo-Mo<br />And did I mention Explosions??<br /><br />If on the other hand you are looking for something with a complicated storyline, heavy on dialogue and plot....well \\"Death Race\\" isn't going to work for you.<br /><br />This is a fun action flick that meets all of the criteria laid out above. The action is almost non-stop, and where Roger Corman's original had a fun campy feel to it, this updated version goes straight for the action and blood.<br /><br />The basic story featured in \\"Death Race\\" is that in 2012, prisoners are forced to race to the death in hopes of gaining freedom. The race takes place in 3 legs around the prison itself. Each prisoner gets a cool and deadly vehicle to compete with, complete with napalm, machine guns and various other weapons. When the top rated racer, \\"Frankenstein\\", is taken out of action, the Warden in charge of the game needs a replacement quick. Luckily (or not so luckily?) Jason Stratham's character arrives just in time to don the \\"Frankenstein\\" mask for the upcoming race.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if I would like this recent remake (so many 1980's remakes coming out of Hollywood have been so disappointing), but gave it the benefit of the doubt. I am glad I did. I love a great action movie, and \\"Death Race\\" more than fits the bill. This is just the type of flick you need when suffering from \\"mortgage-credit-card-kids-job-how in the hell did you do that to the car?-the boss needs what?...when?-how much is the heating bill?\\" type of stress. Forget your world for 90 minutes and just enjoy a film with bullets flying and pyro going off on a regular basis.
1932100660|5.0|Finally a book that tells the real story about diet and nutrition.  There is so much bad advice out there on nutrition.  This book will enlighten anyone on what diet is all about.  Read this and never be confused or decieved again.  One of the best books I have ever read.  If you want a great follow up to this book read John Robbins \\"Healthy at 100\\".
B00178I1PU|4.0|Our 4-year-old boy quickly learned how to position the arrow and hold it in place while pulling the cord back. So far (3 weeks of using it) it's durable and the wooden parts seem like quality work. It does not sucction onto the surface as I sought it would (closer distance helps). My son is better than I to have it stick to the surface and to the target. So, I think it's a matter of technique and skill rather than the matter of the bow/arrow how accurately it works.
B000RZGIOA|5.0|Love the movie...my g/f was more than happy when she opened it for christmas...would do business with anytime

The clothes, the friendship, how everyone's life has taken a turn.  All of it! Best show on T.V. ever, and a great sequel to the show.
0307236722|5.0|I will be the first to admit, I'm not a big fan of Martha Stewart. She does have great ideas for crafting and has some good recipes. But this cookbook is one of my favorites. I love to cook, and their arent alot of cook books out their that go over the essentials of baking along with the best recipes. I'm a good cook, but am new to baking (never had a sweet tooth before). This cookbook covers everything from cookies, breads, cakes, cupcakes, & specialty desserts. The ingredients are not far fetched, and are easy to come by.  The instructions are written very clearly, and you don't need any special equipment to make all of it. To top it all off, she shows you ways to make your desserts look top notch with the simplest of equipment.<br /><br />I give this a five star for all the reasons I have listed. I hope you enjoy it just as much.<br /><br />Way to go Martha for bringing back the traditions of baking! Now if we can only get bake sales back, and allow the school systems to let us bring back the simple things of life, instead of spending way to much money for a dozen cookies/cupcakes in the bakery, that taste horrible!
B0007M4610|5.0|This is a really special Brio train.  It is a little heavier and sturdier than other Brio trains and is so cool. The history of the Japanese Bullet train is fascinating and the little ones literally get a \\"hands-on\\" tutorial.

B001CZVVW8|5.0|Quite often Eurotrash directors gleefully subvert the intentions of the original composer and librettist. Stage directions are ignored, and singers are encouraged to perform actions on stage that run contrary to the actions clearly suggested in the music. Extraneous characters run to and fro, and the mise-en-scène is so radically different than anything ever imagined by the opera's creators that you literally cannot figure out what the story's about. Sometimes such innovative Regietheater can be great fun or even revealing, but 90% of the time it's pretentious nonsense, a perverse and often childish amplification of subtexts. After years of this crud, the Eurostrashcan (aided and often led by Ameritrashers) is crammed with boring \\"avant-garde\\" cliches(which should be an oxymoron). Over 100 of these production disasters can be purchased on standard DVD videos here at Amazon.com.    Among the more acceptable malifactors is the director of this fine \\"Onegin,\\" Robert Carsen, aided and abetted by set-and-costume designer Michael Levine. Plenty of stupid eliminations and additions occur in this production, but the leaf-covered, furniture-cramped-then- empty-spaced Postmodern settings are often visually beautiful in this video, and the principals are rather wonderful -- especially the silken-throated, sexually charismatic baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky (who, as they like to say, \\"IS\\" Onegin\\"), soprano Renée Fleming (at her best as Tatiana), and tenor Ramón Vargas (who sings gloriously and looks exactly like Lenski). Valery Gergiev conducts authoritatively. The widescreen Blu-ray image looks fabulous -- and the sound is spacious and thrilling. This DVD is an edit of the live HD transmission seen in theaters, live from the Met. One hopes all the Met's HD transmissions (for better or for worse) will be available in this exciting new Blu-ray format.    Among the more destructive Blu-ray offerings are the perfectly dreadful Opus Arte \\"Norma\\" (turned into a trivial backstage melodrama), the obfuscatory DG \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\" from Salzburg (in which even the conducting is bad), an absurdly vulgar Arthaus \\"Rigoletto\\" (not too bad musically, however), and an interesting but ultimately dreary minimalist Harmoni Mundi \\"Don Giovanni\\" (conducted by Rene Jacobs and containing some fine singing with added ornamentations not specificed by Mozart). The crazy mixed-up DG \\"Manon\\" is actually fun with its looney concept which keeps Anna Netrebko self-consciously evolving through various personae including Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Ingrid Bergman. She sings gloriously here, and her des Grieux is the likable Rolando Villazon.
0143038583|4.0|This book is a wonderful read for anyone who's interested in thinking about the food that we consume. Pollan explores two extremes of eating habits: the industrialized, seemingly value-added convenience of food in a box vs. the (very) local hunter-gatherer method of catching, foraging and making your own food. Along the way, he visited many kinds of farms and tried out fascinating new things (such as succeeding in recognizing some non-poisonous mushrooms). I personally found the section on vegetarianism/veganism to be boring and a tad sermon-like, but the rest of the book is more interesting and humorous.    The book is a thought-provoking, insightful read about the pervasive and vulnerable industrial food system that has become the standard in America. It certainly has made me more conscious of my purchasing decisions at the supermarket and restaurant. In the end, Pollan and the reader recognize the futility of the two extremes that he explored in the book. The book made a big impact on me, in terms of the way I think of food, the way we grow it and consume it. It is interesting that some readers respect Pollan so much as to comment (on the New York Times website) that he should be Obama's new \\"Secretary of Food\\". Nevertheless, I would recommend this educational book to anyone interested in finding out more about the process of producing food.
B001GKYBXA|1.0|I read everyones glowing reviews and thought,ok I'll buy this one hoping that it is as good as everyone said. Well, I am a Beatle fan and a Paul McCartney fan but the album/CD is very disappointing to me. The music is okay and a bit unusual but okay like I said. By the way watch the you tube 222 video and you will understand. Had I saw that first before buying the CD I wouldn't have bought it. Track 3 I liked. But, his voice is strained and he sounds more nasal than usual and he is just getting old. He's a great guy with great credits but regrettably he should just retire. I bought the US DVD and I thought that it was good even though you could see the years were catching up. He can entertain, true, but this Fireman CD isn't worth the money.
031606792X|4.0|Being the last (?) book on the series, I was quite happy that suffering the 1st book and going through the near-mediore follow-ups haven't been in vain.  The hefty conclusion (?) to the series retains the captivating \\"magic\\" of TWILIGHT, the  maturity that NEW MOON started, and the great pace that ECLIPSE has propelled.<br /><br />One thing that this book introduced which was not in any of the previous installments is the chance to see the story in another character's eyes. The previous books were all in the lead character's narration.  This book is divided into 3 segments, Bella's, followed by Jacob's, then back to Bella.  Though I admire the author's attempt, I don't think that it was all too successful.  As you may have noticed, I said \\"character's eyes\\" and not Point of View.<br /><br />I believe that this attempt was more due to necessity than creativity.  The part where Jacob takes on the narration was a time of the story that would have been impossible for the lead to narrate (sorry by being a bit cryptic but I don't want to spoil anything).  Though it was Jacob narrating, I could still \\"hear\\" Bella talking.  The only difference between Bella and Jacob's narration was that Jacob's used more colloquial ...  too slang, that it had a feel of being forced and a tad pretentious.  Aside from the slang, Bella and Jacob used the same lexica, sentence construction and narrative nuisances. I know that this is a difficult thing to pull-off so I give the author credit for the effort and bravado.<br /><br />When I started reading the saga with TWILIGHT, I honestly thought that I was wasting my time.  Since I bought the whole saga as a set, I thought that I might as well finish the whole thing before giving it as a gift or selling it online.  I'm glad that I had continued reading though.  The story has developed into something I wouldn't have expected.  It wasn't only the characters in the book who developed and matured, but the writer as well.<br /><br />If the gossip that a 5th book will be released holds true, I'm sure that I'll be there in line (or online) to be one of the firsts to take a bite.holds true, I'm sure that I'll be there in line (or online) to be one of the firsts to take a bite.
0956010903|5.0|The tales of Beedle the Bard are a must-have for any real Harry Potter fan. The coolest thing about this very fancy edition is the booklet that contains the stories itself. The big book that hides the small one is nice and well-made, the little red bag that contains the book is pretty, the framable prints are not that interesting but in the end this is not why you would buy this book. The tales of Beedle the Bard are intricate, original and funny, they exeeded my expectations. The whole thing is ridiculously expensive of course, but its for a good cause :-)
B001F7MSES|4.0|I found the story, character development to be much improved over the first Hellboy. All the characters were really great in their roles and the love interest subplot was cool. Most movies just rely on effects and less on story, but this movie has both, great monsters,effects and a great story. Another good comic book hero story makes it big time on the screen. The DVD Collectors Set comes with the Golden Army robot and booklet, DVD and is worth every penny. I think if you like super hero movies in general this shouldn't disappoint. I thought it was better than the Spiderman movies and as good as any of the Xmen movies. I liked it better than Dark Knight as well. This is one action adventure hero movie with substance.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll openly admit that I'm in the group of people who had never even heard of Firefly until recently.  My sister, who's a few years older than myself left me borrow it.    The first episode was a bit of an odd...futuristic space ships mixed with cowboys is a bit odd, but the series keeps getting better and better.  My wife and I could not get enough of this series.  We watched the entire series in a span of 3 days.  Wonderful series, I'd highly recommend it.  And if you've only watched the first two or three episodes and can't get into it give it a shot, it really takes off around disk 2.

B00127RAJY|5.0|After watching Jillian in action on tv's \\"The Biggest Loser\\" I knew I wanted to test out her methods. I bought this dvd after I bought her book 'Making the Cut'. Both are excellent and I highly recommend them both. Jillian will not make this workout easy for you, and that's why it works. The format is easy to follow along with and she has two women who do the work out with her. One is modified and the other is balls-out. Losing weight it DIFFICULT and getting results that last is HARD. We all need to be sweating big time and that's the bottom line. The exercise combines compound movements for maximum results and no rest in the transitions. Jillian uses her 3-2-1 system which is 3min. strength(with hand weights and body movements) 2 min cardio and 1min abs. There are 3 levels of difficulty but they are all tough. Getting thru this dvd will put a well earned smile on your face because you will know you are tough and that you really want to be healthy!

The ending is frustrating, because it's a murder mystery without knowing who the killer is. That, of course, is the intention. Watch this and then go see Benjamin Button.
B00005JLKN|4.0|This is a remake of Manhunter which I love the cast of, though not necessarily the adaptation of the book. Manhunter, originally made for TV, was better.
B00000I41G|5.0|Kenny Burrell-Midnight Blue *****<br /><br />Boy oh boy, was 1967 an amazing year for music or what? Midnight Blue, the crowning achievement of one of Jazz, and Blues greatest guitar slingers has found it's self a home near the top of the greatest releases of that year and from both astounding genres.<br /><br />Now it is rare to hear of an amazing jazz guitarist who had reached such critical acclaim besides the likes of say Wes Montgomery and the like. But Burrell has found himself the title of the \\"Bluesiest jazz guitar player ever, or maybe he is the jazziest blues player ever!?\\" One things for sure the man has a gift and places it on showcase during Midnight Blue.<br /><br />The title says it all, the album feels and sounds like the album. Late night cool listening is where this one is at. Recruiting the most minimal of groups. A simple guitar, bass, tenor sax, and percussion to round out the sound made up this legendary release.<br /><br />Tracks like the title track, 'Chitlins Con Carne' and 'Mule' are true blue guitar workouts. Go back to the woodshed six stringers if you think you can hang with Burrell. 'Wavy Gravy' is more than just the name sake for that hippie, it is one of B.B. Kings all time favorite guitar tracks.<br /><br />As a guitar player this is essential. As a jazz or blues fan, this is a must own.
1433502410|5.0|This is one of the better Study Bibles I've seen.  Another excellent one is Tyndale's Life Application Study Bible in the New Living Translation. Both have many maps, charts, and timelines and have notes for almost every verse.  The ESV Study Bible also has many illustrations and its maps are in color.    As its name implies, it is a study bible.  If you just want to sit down and read the bible, you'll find yourself stopping frequently to glance at the notes, maps, illustrations and timelines.  And that's just the way it should be read, to get the most out of what God wants you to know.
0151013837|4.0|I'm a teacher and the illustrations help to explain much of the book, like the boat's dimensions. Although author Martel describes everything, the pictures give a better idea of how little space there is on the boat with Pi and Richard Parker. Plus, the first person POV is a great idea. Recommended.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Adaptation with a whose who of the Royal Shakespearean Theatre. Great work all-around. An adaptation not to be missed for Austin fans.
0312383320|3.0|I happened to really like this book, although it was clear a lot of people didn't. However, in all fairness, I got my copy from the library because $29 for this book? INSANE. I usually wait until they show up at my local library book sales for $2.<br /><br />That being said, I still think this was one of the better between the numbers books. Yes, it lacked Ranger and a lot of Morelli and Bob the dog, whom I love, and especially grandma, who makes the books absolutely hilarious. What I did like about this book because it had Diesel in it was that he seemed sufficiently much less weird than he is in other books. In previous novels, he always seemed to have this superhuman lack of ethics, morals and principles whereas in this book he seems to respect Stephanie's boundaries and not just make sexual innuendos every chance he gets.<br /><br />And whoever dissed Carl is crazy because he made the book funny. I loved the part when Diesel brings him the fruit and Carl looks at him like he's nuts, makes a rude gesture and makes off with the cookies.<br /><br />What everyone else has also pointed out is that this is the first \\"full-length\\" between the numbers novel. I think this contributed to the book's detriment. For one thing, all of us are complaining of a lack of Ranger and Joe, central characters in the regular books. I also felt this book dragged on for much, much longer than it needed to. Sure there were some funny gags as the book went on, but it was too long for a Diesel book.<br /><br />I recommend getting this book from your library and waiting until it's $2-3 to buy it if you're a diehard collector.

0316017922|1.0|After reading all three of Gladwell's books (Tipping Point, Blink, and Outlier), I have pretty much figured out his formula.  Glackwell is half black as well as a Canadian.  Basically, he writes about things that would normally be politically incorrect for a white person to write about.  For example, according to Gladwell, Asians are good at math because they come from a culture of growing rice.  He does this from behind the \\"shield\\" of being half black, so of course he can't possibly be implying anything racist or ethnocentric.  In addition, Gladwell has a very obvious ideology that he is espousing - essentially that of a political liberal who believes that the individual is less important than the culture he comes from or the lucky advantages the individual enjoys.  In other words, the important thing is the collective.<br /><br />Some of the insights in Outlier are interesting.  I have to admit it's a bit refreshing to read some of the politically incorrect things that Gladwell gets away with saying (but most others cannot say simply because these things are not stated often in our self-censured society).  But on the whole, the basic premise - that people who enjoy success owe more to luck than to their own effort - is flawed.<br /><br />Some degree of luck certainly plays a role in the extreme cases, such as Bill Gates.  However, is it really any sort of major insight that Gates was helped along because he enjoyed free access to a time sharing computer?  In fact, millions of people did at the time in universities and businesses across the globe.  It is accurate to state that spending a lot of time writing computer code is required to become a successful entrepreneur in software, but not that this success is a direct result of having done so.  It's no different than saying that to be a great basketball player, you need to practice many hours per day.  But practicing hours per day does not mean that you will be a great basketball player.  Something more is required, such as natural talent and perhaps heart and will.  In other words, Gladwell's Outlier theory is based on a fundamental error in logic.<br /><br />Here is the basic logical flaw:  \\"All people that become great NBA stars practice basketball many hours per day for many years.  Jerome practiced basketball many hours per day for many years. Therefor, Jerome is an NBA star.\\"  Um, sorry.  That is an error in logic that is glaringly obvious to anyone that, for example, has written computer code! (And therefor knows something about logic).  This logical error in Gladwell's thinking is so obvious that it is remarkable that nobody seems to point it out or that he hasn't lost his popularity as smart people that read his books dismiss him.  Does this not happen because his readers just are not that smart?  Is it because he is half black and immune to criticism?<br /><br />Gladwell fails to account for the huge group of people that are, say, millionaires but not billionaires.  These are people that mostly worked hard to get what they have.  In other words, they are people that made good choices, such as studying and applying themselves.  Do they owe something to the culture they were born into, such as having a \\"future time orientation\\" and \\"protestant work ethic.\\"  Probably.  So?  Should they not apply the lessons of their culture?  Does their work ethic culture mean that they somehow are less worthy of the fruits of their labor?  These people did, after all, have choices.  Their culture did not force them to study, pursue goals, work hard, to save money, and so on.  These people individually made these choices.<br /><br />Underlying Gladwell's work is a deep animosity towards the very white people that seem to eat up his books with such fervor.  White farmers, for example, are lazy, according to Gladwell (as opposed to Asian rice farmers).  My white mother grew up on a farm and I can say for certain that white farmers work 365 days per year. He makes many observations aboutthe cultures of various groups and, without much evidence, links these cultural observations to what these groups appear to be good at doing.  There is never any mention, however, of why blacks as a group are poorer and perform below other groups in things such as school.  There is plenty of mention of how blacks were oppressed by whites, however, so the implied excuse for blacks is that all of their problems are the fault of whitey.<br /><br />Gladwell picks and chooses from anecdotal history and this or that scientific study in an attempt to prove his flawed thesis.  His work lacks rigor.  While his books provide tid-bits of insight here and there thanks to well written descriptions of real research, they disappoint when it comes to pulling this information together to provide a larger meaning.<br /><br />Gladwell is popular at the moment.  But I do not think that his books will prove to be the lasting sort that will be read for insight 20 or even 10 years from now.
B00005JLEU|5.0|An all time favorite of mine--I freaked when I saw it available on Amazon.  My daughter and my neice love this movie, too!  It arrived well before I was expecting it too.  I watched it that night-perfect video quality and the dvd arrived in mint condition.

B000268QB2|5.0|This album is very good.  It reminds me of 80's music combined with a Radiohead feel.  Good from the first song to the last spectacular \\"Bedshaped.\\"
B000UR9T8W|5.0|Great movie set. Nice collectors pack. Good price. Great addition to my collection of the greatest movies ever.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I am not a huge fan of comic book movies, but I thought this one was absolutely fantastic.  In my opinion, it is better than its predecessor and is probably the best comic book movie I have ever seen.  I thought it dragged a bit during my first viewing in the theater, but a second viewing at home gave me a better appreciation for the movie's pacing, foreshadowing, plot development, and sthematic elements.    The plot is intentionally choatic, as Batman's nemesis despises order and attempts to push Gotham towards a state he views as inevitably unordered.  This is one of the elements that created some confusion on my part in the theater (when is this thing going to end?  where? how?), but it becomes much more evident the second go-round and is probably the movie's best creative point.  Basically, Batman can't be the city's hero (in an Aristotelean sense, his 'justice' is defined without respect to society at large), and the Joker will do everything he can to prevent the real hero (D.A. Harvey Dent) from fulfilling his potential, all the while allowing minor nuances of human nature to do his dirty work for him.  Thus the chaos, thus the pacing, thus the uneven (but still rewarding) resolution.    Christopher Nolan borrows heavily from other directors here, but synthesis is often as rewarding as creativity.  The opening scene is very reminiscent of the bank heist in Heat (going so far as to use one of Heat's minor characters), the unsettling music backing the Joker's rampages reminds me of Johnny Greenwood's scoring of 'There Will Be Blood,' and the tunnel scene is Bourne 2 without the white lights.  Plus...cameo by Anthony Michael Hall!!!    My only regret is that the version I watched did not come with any bonus features.  No commentary, nothing.  You might want to consider the 2-disc version for this reason.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Love to see this come to the big screen and to see the multi talented Robert Downing Jr back at his best!!
B001GQSY64|5.0|My husband wanted this for Christmas and we both just loved it. He wants to get the series now too.
B0010ZR160|3.0|Mostly watchable private detective story about a missing girl that is captivating for a good part of its running time and the acting is above par. However some scenes are pretty harsh and the ending maybe a little contrived. Not quite worth the hype but again better than most of what is put on the shelves these days.
B000NDI3SK|4.0|I personally love this, but it won't appeal to everyone. Bronowski's style is _very_ low-key.  You have to pay close attention to follow his arguments, which are very well thought out.  Children and younger teens would likely be bored, as he is not an animated speaker, and he assumes a certain degree of background knowledge on the part of his audience.    Given the above, it's a wonderful companion piece to James Burke's \\"Connections\\". They take different approaches; neither right or wrong, but offering differing views of the  astonishing complexity of human history and experience.
B001GKJ2F2|4.0|A good value, and a much appreciated gift for my sister.  I never liked this movie, even in theaters, but she thought it was great.  The special effects are impressive, and with a lot of the movie filmed in Chicago IL, it was fun to see some of the sights from our home city on film yet again.  The special features are quite interesting and pretty much made the purchase worth it in my mind.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|There are a few Sex and the City complete series out there, but this is the nicest one to own. The velvet cover, scrap book type of packaging all made the price tag worth it.     My only complaint is the video quality for Season 1 is quite bad. I only hope that they could have polished up the image.
B001I189MQ|5.0|This special edition DVD is solid.  Typical Nolan special features (no deleted scenes), but I still enjoyed what is there, especially the IMAX scenes.    The digital copy is quite convenient.     Also glad to see Heath got the golden globe for this.

0802798225|4.0|Fairfield, a suburb of Chicago, is really two worlds in essence. On the north-side, there are the wealthy, snobby white fold with their designed clothes, cars, and lives. On the south-side, gang life and poverty is common amongst the Latinos. These opposite sides of town don't mix, especially with their many prejudices against each other, so naturally, trouble brews when Brittany Ellis, a pretty and popular north-sider, and Alex Fuentes, a gang member from the south-side, are forced to be lab partners in their chemistry class. Yet, aside from the obvious differences, Brittany and Alex are the same, putting up a certain image to cover up the other disasters in their lives. And neither is prepared, amidst prejudices from all sides and the ever-present factor of Alex's gang involvement, for what they do find--love.    Reminiscent of the classics Romeo and Juliet and West Side Story, Perfect Chemistry is an oh-so-romantic tale of love between two opposing groups of people, but with a twist. Elkeles wonderfully portrays the surface differences between Brittany and Alex, especially family and everyday life, without making them into the stereotypical good-girl-bad-boy couple. I liked how Brittany and Alex each had their own unique identity and how they managed to overcome any prejudices they previously felt to be with each other. The attraction between these too is so intense that it's practically tangible, and readers will be rooting for them to be together. Perfect Chemistry includes a realistic view of the harshness of gang life and the danger that comes with that territory, as well as the trials and difficulties of living with family with special needs and others who may want what's best but don't necessarily know what that is. Perfect Chemistry is an unforgettable tale about forbidden romance and overcoming the odds.    Perfect Chemistry will be a hit among teens looking for a sweet and romantic story as well as fans of all variations of Romeo and Juliet, including Chasing Windmills by Catherine Ryan Hyde.
0793563836|5.0|The Hal Leonard Bass Method books a wonderfully informative. They start at at a very basic and comfortable level, and then work their way up from there. Very informative, well organized, and easy to follow, this is one of the best instructional Bass books available. This book is great for a bassist who is just starting out, or an already a good player who just needs a refreshment course. This book contains books 1-2-3 which is an excellent thing. I only have the first two books, but I am looking for the third. Don't make the mistake I did and buy them separately, it is much more convenient and cheaper to buy them in one book. So, if you are starting to play this wonderful instrument, or just need to refresh some basic skills, the Hal Leonard Bass Method book is one of the best available. you will not regret learning from this great book.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is a great movie that anyone at any age can enjoy. It tells, in a series of flashbacks, the story of Edward Bloom's amazing life. Edward's son has many problems with his father, but obviously, one of the points of the movie is that they resolve their father and son problems. I really enjoyed this movie, and so did every one else in my family. Filled with many funny and far fetched moments, Big Fish is a light hearted movie great for anyone. You will never regret watching this wonderful movie.

0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell writes yet another thought provoking book that may switch the light in the brain.  OUTLIERS:  THE STORY OF SUCCESS not only shows that hard work and intellect are possible keys to one's success, but that one cannot achieve their goals without being at the right place at the right time without the right people who may make it happen, i.e. it is not necessarily what you know but rather who you know.  Gladwell reveals that element as well as other examples that helped to determine the results of success and failure of all of the individuals who were described in the book.  From the famous, Bill Gates and the Beatles, to the not so famous, Chris Langan, there may be a story that may astound, amaze, or simply provide food for thought.<br /><br />And the book may also hit a nerve for readers who have experienced similar circumstances as these individuals.  This is a helpful and enlightening examination of how people interact and interconnect with one another, which complements Gladwell's previous works, THE TIPPING POINT AND BLINK.  Indeed, a book worth reading.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I was lucky enough to get to a movie house when the original Star Wars started its run.  I thought: \\"Oh well, just another SF movie.\\"  Then, the movie started with that incredible opening shot of a space ship being chased by an incredibly large battle cruiser.  WOW!  Also, the sound ROCKED!    The original Star Wars was FANTASTIC!  Glitches, errors, and all, it was the best SF movie I had ever seen.      That battle cruiser was chasing a small ship carrying Princess Lea.  Two robots escape.  Eventually Luke Skywalkeer (Hamill) gets involved with the robots.  Soon, we are on our way to freeing Princess Lea and fighting against the Empire.    Later, George Lukas tried to \\"fix\\" the most popular SF movie of all time. Lucas's 'fixes' grate on my nerves! Happy to say, the original is packaged in this release.  View the original, let Lucas's foolishness gather dust.     For whatever reason, the Original version had magic in it.  All the sequels and pre-quels are lesser movies.  And, unfortunately, some of the re-releases of this episode are very disappointing.  I had unfortunate problems with a used 1977 special edition VHS tape.  The quality of the picture and sound was bad, possibly due to stretching from being played a good deal.  So be careful to preview any product you recieve to be certain it is of the quality advertised.  If otherwise, return with refund request (e-mail first!).
0739368044|4.0|Gerard Doyle does a phenomenal job reading for the audio book version of Brisingr.  Listening to his various voices and inflections for each character makes this like hearing a theatrical production.  I recommend the audio version over the printed version by far.  It's the only way to go.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|So far the DVD's have been great...I gave them as a gift and received them in plenty of time. I only watched some of the first and second season but the color was a little grainy but they may have just been how they were originally. Either way I was very pleased with my purchase and the price!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Who wouldn't want Michael Caine for her valet?  The actors in this movie were excellent and the performances, top notch.  Both villains were weird enough and sympathetic enough to hold attention.  Batman himself suffers over his decision to be a city-saver, giving up romance and the full-time cushy life.    I hope there will be another installment.  I am not a huge movie person but have enjoyed this series.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|A good flick!  Daniel Craig may have been dubbed as some sort of non-dark haired, unorthodox James Bond portrayer, but his first excursion into the role is satisfying, sometimes intense, and suitably pleasing in the garb of the James Bond genre.  I did miss the sometimes over-the-top sexual undercurrents, connotations, and double-entendres that have accompanied most of the previous Bond films, but I suppose the producers feel that those things have run their course and have phased them out.  In attending the showing of this film when it was in theaters, I did not hear one single laugh in the entire course of the film........not even a good snicker.  That was part of the charm of previous Bond characterizations by Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan.  That charm seems to be missing from Mr. Craig's portrayal, with more attention paid to his abdominal muscle definition than his humor.  As long as you can accept the change in Bond's character and stomach the destruction of a beautiful Aston-Martin, this is a good adventure.

As far as I know it's the same written words, but the presentation is magical, and that's really what this version is all about.<br /><br />And at least at my mom's house - this latest edition to her Harry Potter corner looks fantastic.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I live in the UK and purchased the WALL:E 3 Disc Edition with Digital Copy as I have a Multi Region DVD player.

B0007OCG56|1.0|I couldn't stand more than twenty minutes of this film. What has happened to James L. Brooks? He has created two of my favorite comedies (Real Life and Broadcast News) and possibly the best show ever on TV (The Simpsons), but this movie was awful. First of all, the script was hackneyed and the characters were one dimensional. I knew who each character was, and I could see the arc of the entire film, in ten minutes. Second, the directing was ham handed. The reactions shots were lengthy, obvious and terrible. Third, the acting was ATROCIOUS. I have never seen a person try as hard to act neurotic at Tea Leoni. Cloris Leachman as the mom was over-the-top wacky, and the \\"fun\\" moments suffered the fate of almost all \\"fun\\" moments in film: you could literally see the quotation marks around \\"fun.\\" Everyone look at how much \\"fun\\" this is. See my smile? I'm having \\"fun\\". I'm really \\"letting myself go.\\" Contrasting with this was Adam Sandler, who must have been asked to provide a counterbalance to the neurotic hilarity, so he had his entire face botoxed and got voice lessons from Ben Stein. Wooden. Hey, maybe this movie got really good after the first twenty minutes. If so, I would consider it a better comeback than Jesus on Pentecost.
0385736002|5.0|This was such a great escape read...and I can't wait for the next book.  Poised and powerful writing but done so subtly to let you enjoy the ride.  It's like walking out of the triple flip roller coaster that you didn't know you got on...still trying to catch your breath, and find something to hang on to.  A great story.  Dr. John Dee's smell jumps out of the book everytime it is mentioned and that menancing odor as well as the others that are referenced make the story familiar and alive. The emotions are so simply described that it is difficult not to feel them and build from that which makes the story better.  The mythilogical references make the story believable even though it is a work of fiction.
B001LA3LYU|5.0|and I own quite a few. I'm going to make this review very short. The sound quality of this recording is phenomenal, Beck's tone is superb, and of course the playing is awe-inspiring (I guess that's why Jeff Beck is a legend). Anyway, I usually only feel inspired to write a review when I feel the music deserves 5 stars, but I don't know if I can give anymore 5 star reviews after hearing this album. This, in my most humble opinion, is the top of the mountain. Highly Highly recommended!

055358894X|4.0|This was one of those books that I thought was going to get 5 stars from me, but eventually ended up as 'merely quite good' in my mind.    The absolute best part of the book are the characterizations, including the dialogue.  The characters are definitely individuals, and they have wonderful banter with each other.  That said, I do have a few problems with some of these interactions.  Certain characters seemed just a bit more capable of dissembling, especially around other characters which supposedly should be quite good at knowing if another person believes them or not.    The writing itself is excellent.  I don't recall any obviously awkward turns of phrase.  The imagery is quite well done.  Action scenes make sense within the story, and have real consequences as opposed to just being thrown in for some excitement.    The plot itself presents a bit of a problem.  It's one of those books that appears to be going very strongly and focusedly in one direction, and then all of a sudden it takes off at a right angle.  If you were really getting into the first part of the story, as I was, it might seem a bit of a letdown to suddenly lose the thread.  While the thread of the first part of the plot is picked up again near the end, to me it didn't have quite the same interest as it did previously.  The middle part of the book definitely has a different feel than the first part, and I didn't think it was as interesting, even if it was pretty realistic.  Some people complained about 'jumps in time'.  The main flashbacks all have an 'Interlude' as part of the chapter name, and thus are pretty easy to spot.  There was one not so obvious time jump, but I thought it was quite cleverly done and not much of a distraction.    I actually didn't have too many problems with some of the 'luck' that Locke Lamora seems to have near the end.  And I really enjoyed the convoluted plot that Locke came up with, all for a set of clothes.  I also didn't have any problems with the swearing that I've seen show up in a lot of negative reviews.  One of the complaints is that the swearing is 'modern English' (American style modern English anyhow).  Well, they're _speaking_ modern English in the book.  What should they swear in?  Now if you have a problem with them speaking 'Modern English' in general, then that's one thing.  As far as the swearing itself, well, the people who do it aren't nice, genteel, cultured people (and I've seen nice, genteel, cultured people drop a curse once in awhile too).  I found it refreshing and it made the dialogue truer than it is in many books.    I also usually hate 'obvious mysteries'.  By this, I mean a mystery that other characters know about but that the reader is never brought into fully.  This book has one, and I actually liked it a fair bit.  The key element here is that it really has no bearing on the book itself, but meshes VERY well with how groups of people act and talk in the real world.  Close groups who have someone who's left the group, often talk about them or remember them even if they've been gone for awhile, and this is basically the 'obvious mystery' in this book even though you never meet the individual they refer to.  Just one more touch that I like.    So in the end, I really enjoyed this book, primarily because of the characters and dialogue.  The writer is far more accomplished at his craft than one would expect from a first time author.  There were a couple of missteps along the way which dropped the rating for me down a notch.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch are gunmen who take it upon themselves to keep the law in a small town.  They find themselves up against land-owner Randall Bragg, a thoroughly dangerous man who has the deviousness and the clout to get himself out of almost any situation.  What he didn't expect, however, was Hitch and Cole.  And what Hitch and Cole didn't expect was a mysterious young woman...<br /><br />Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen were born to act together; you saw it in \\"A History of Violence,\\" and you see it here, too.  The two men have such chemistry, you fully believe that they have been riding together for years.  It should also be mentioned that Harris is, perhaps, the consumate Western actor: he has the grit and the stature to play a rough-and-tumble outlaw.<br /><br />It's nice to see Jeremy Irons snarling his way across the screen again.  Lance Henriksen leads the stellar supporting cast.  Renee Zellweger is, perhaps, a bit mis-cast; she doesn't exactly have the chops to hold her own with her co-stars, though she does certainly try.  Harris's directing is top-notch; the man has a feel for Westerns, the way they should be framed and felt.  \\"Appaloosa\\" comes off feeling like it was made decades ago, back when Westerns weren't just popular, they were an art form.  It may not be as great as some of the classics, but it's a wonderful homage, and a worthy entry into the Western film cannon.
B001KO3FFW|3.0|I actually like this album.  I wasn't sure what to expect but he delivers pretty well for being an American Idol.  The only problem is it is really nothing new and maybe I am just getting tired of this type of sound.  I still like him a lot though.
0316017922|5.0|What makes for success? It may not be the woman behind every successful man, but a series of cultural and/or temporal breaks that make his hard work pay extraordinary dividends. \\"Outliers\\" shows how Korean deference-to-authority caused their jets to crash---a problem that cultural modifications corrected; sites cultural norms driving the famous feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys; and describes how 10,000 hours of practice trumps innate talent, every time.     The book's only flaw was failing to touch on the culture that created the proverbial woman-behind-every-man and which continues to deny most women the opportunity to attain outlier status on their own. Nonetheless, \\"Outliers\\" is a fresh and significant contribution to understanding the forces behind our fortunes.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I am very happy with the service.  I got the dvd set quickly after i ordered it and didn't have to worry if it was going to come by Christmas.  Plus, the package came just as it was described, brand new still wrapped in its original plastic.
B0002KQNJU|2.0|As a longtime Polanski fan, I was greatly disappointed when I finally bought and watched the DVD of this film.<br /><br />I suppose comedy is in the eye of the beholder, but in my opinion most everything in the film is poorly staged and falls flat. The humor is purely physical, and involves doofuses getting jammed crawling through tiny windows, hit on the head with salamis, and falling down steps repeatedly. There are certainly some interesting Polanski touches--and the film often looks striking--but the film is confusing from the very beginning.  The story starts off in an inn (apparently in Transylvania), and the viewer is thrown headlong into the story before the characters have been established or their relationships defined. I had to watch the film a second time to catch what was going on. (The film was edited at some point without Polanski's input, so perhaps the editing led to the confusion.)<br /><br />Once the story switches to the vampire's castle, the action picks up quite a bit, but even so, as a Hammer parody, \\"Vampire Killers\\" leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Fortunately, Polanski didn't veer into comedy too often, his only other attempt being the big-budget disaster, \\"Pirates.\\"

0956010903|4.0|I ordered this for my son for Christmas.  Although I was somewhat surprised at the actual size of the book, it was very attractive and my son was excited about receiving it.  I'm not sure I would have ordered it had I known it's actual size.  Maybe I just didn't pay attention to the description, but I don't remember anything that indicated that the actual book was so small.  This, however, may have been my oversight, and I am nevertheless happy with its overall quality and would probably order it again even given the small size.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful movies to come out in years. Some people will find this movie boring, simply because it doesn't show anything particularly out of the ordinary, but that is precisely what makes it so beautiful.    This movie is not, nor does it try to be, anything more than a slice of life set to music. The real magic of the movie comes from its simple, honest treatment of the everyday life of two musicians in Dublin and their meeting. Their relationship is both realistic and playful, and the fact that it never stoops to the cheesy or melodramatic keeps the movie down to earth where it belongs. We don't even ever learn the characters' names.    Those who do not like the music of this movie (mainly indie acoustic singer-songwriter-style) will not like this movie either. However, anyone who can appreciate beautiful and symbolic music should watch it just for the tunes. Both the lyrics and melody are simple and haunting, just like everything else in this movie.    I cannot recommend this movie enough.
B00133KFGW|5.0|On a scale of one to ten, this movie is a 12!  I have recommended it to friends who have bought it \\"unseen\\", and they've agreed with my opinion.  One must \\"watch\\" this movie, and \\"listen\\" also.  I sure wish they'd make more like this one!
076790592X|5.0|This book surprised me very much. When I first saw and heard about the book I did not think it would be up to the hype some people gave it, but as soon as you get pat the first two chapters this book draws you in. The depth of Mitch's and Morrie's relationship is very detailed. Every lesson in the book can be converted to modern day life. This book both educates and states the truth of our society. As Mitch and Morrie get more and more close to the death of Morrie the book becomes harder to put down. You always want to know what Morrie will say about the next subject. This book will tug on your heart the whole way and will also let you know exactly how to live life to its fullest. This to me is worth everything. This book lives up to the hype people give it and even fly's past it. Once you pick up the book you will not be able to put it down, and your life will forever be changed. You will look at our world and society different, like Morrie did. Life's greatest lesson is something hard to grasp, but Mitch Albom spells it out for everyone that reads this book with Morrie's words.
1591841666|5.0|Sometimes it's perfectly OK to be a quitter.  Yes, this may seem contrary to everything you've heard before. At the same time, Seth Godin knows what he's talking about. In his book, The Dip - A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (And When to Stick), Godin shares insight to help you determine if you're on the right path and if maybe you should quit or stick it out.    We all know that every new project, career opportunity or even hobby usually starts out with tons of excitement and enthusiasm. Then, somewhere along the line we lose initiative, maybe we're not as zealous as we once were or perhaps we're simply stuck in a rut. One thing is for certain. If you continue to do the same thing you've always done to get the same results you've always gotten that may not be enough to survive let alone thrive in today's business world.    Ask yourself \\"Am I doing the best possible job I can do?\\" Be honest. Chances are there are areas of your performance that really need to be juiced up. Godin poses the question \\"If you're not going to put in the effort to be the best possible choice, why bother?\\"    Why, indeed?    It's much easier to be mediocre than it is to confront reality and quit. According to Godin, quitting is much harder than you might think. Quitting requires you to realize you'll never be #1 in the world. At least not at what you're doing right now. So, it's easier to put it off, not admit it - it's easier to settle for mediocre.    Mediocrity is rampant in this day and age. The Dip illustrates lackluster attempts at success such as; ALL CAPITAL LETTERS in a job application, junk mail with misspelled names, salespeople who are eager to open an account but never follow up, doctors who don't bother to call to see if the prescribed medicines are working. I'm sure you can come up with a handful of examples yourself.    Here's another question from Godin, \\"Are you hoping to become a success because you're the only one being considered?\\"    If so, it's time to reassess your own motivation and realize you are not the only game in town. Not only that but the internet has taken business to a global level and you can bet there ARE other choices.    Here's another thought to ponder. According to Godin, some of our learned behaviors originating from our school days are the source of discontent and even failure. Godin points out \\"Just about everything we learned in school about life is wrong, but the most wrong thing might very well be this: Being well rounded is the secret to success.\\"    He goes on to ask, \\"How often do you look for someone who is actually quite good at things you don't need them to do?\\" \\"How often do you hope your accountant is a safe driver and a decent golfer?\\"    In a nutshell, it makes more sense to be really good at one thing, your specialty and that will set you apart from the crowd. Chances are you're really passionate about one thing but can do many. Wouldn't you be happier focusing on your passion?      There are, according to Godin, three curves that define almost any type of situation facing you as you try to accomplish your goals.      1) Curve 1 is The Dip: The Dip is where the challenges begin. The combination of bureaucracy and busywork you must deal with in order to become what you really want to be. It's the hard steps you endure to be the best that you can be. Successful people don't just ride out the Dip, they lean into it, push harder, change the rules and come out on top.    2) Curve 2 is The Cul-De-Sac: This is the French word for \\"dead end\\". It's the situation where you continue doing the same thing and nothing changes. It's doesn't necessarily get better or worse -it just is. That's why there are positions referred to as \\"dead end jobs\\". When you realize you're in the Cul-De-Sac you must get out. Because a dead end keeps you from doing something of real value.    3) Curve 3 is The Cliff: Godin likens this to smoking. Smoking can bring pleasure but over time there is a nasty drop off at theend (emphysema). Smoking is designed to be almost impossible to quit, the longer you do it, the better it feels. The pain of quitting gets bigger and bigger. The Cliff is the situation where you cannot get out (quit) until you fall off or fall apart.     The bottom line is, if it's worth doing there's probably a Dip. The Dip creates scarcity and scarcity creates value. The Cul-De-Sac and The Cliff are the curves that lead to failure. Godin says if you find yourself in either of these two curves you need to quit. Not soon, but now.    Where are you? Have you found The Dip? Are you stuck in the Cul-De-Sac? Ready to fall off of the Cliff?  Is it time for you to quit or stick?
B00004XMTJ|5.0|It was a wonderful surprise to be able to find this dvd at such a great price! The seller's \\"new\\" price was much lower than the stores' or other online-buying websites' that I had researched. It was received in perfect, factory-sealed condition as stated, and also within a shorter shipping time than advertised. Amazon.com made dvd shopping from home so much easier than fighting the crowds and has a larger variety of movies to choose from.
0810979772|5.0|We got this for our 10yo son this Christmas.  He'd gone through the red & blue \\"Wimpy Kid\\" books & we're waiting on the green one to arrive.    He took it to class last week (4th grade) to read during his free time & it lasted two days.  Someone stole it &, despite the teacher's best efforts to keep it anonymous, no one will turn it in!  So, I'm buying a 2nd book to replace the stolen one.    I agree with the comment about being good for kids going into middle school.  Our son is \\"green\\" & shy about most things (which I'm finding isn't too common these days) & this (as well as the others) has been good at breaking ice on akward moments that might arise.  I enjoy the creativity of the cartoon/comic drawings as well.  He loves them all!
B001GCUNVW|5.0|I have been eagerly anticipating The Wrestler since I first heard about it towards the end of 2008. A friend of mine had the opportunity to see it and raved about it to me. The Wrestler stars Mickey Rourke as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a pro-wrestler whose fame and glory has come and gone, and is reduced to working part time at a grocery store and performing as a wrestler in high school gymnasiums and other small venues. Mickey's performance is nothing short of heartbreaking as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson. Just like Mickey in real life, Randy's life has not been kind to him. He is estranged from his now grown up daughter Stephanie (played brilliantly by Evan Rachel Wood). His health has made him question his career in wrestling. Randy is constantly struggling with his finances, works part time at a job he hates, and his love life is essentially non-existent.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film immensely. Because of the cinematography, there was many times when I felt that I was watching a documentary than a fictional movie. I thought that was a great idea for Darren Aronofsky to have the movie shot in a way that it felt like a documentary. The performances by Mickey, Marissa, and Evan were devastatingly heartbreaking to watch especially Mickey as Randy. The hair metal soundtrack although albeit too loud at times was perfect. The music did capture the era in which Randy's success was at its peak which was in the 1980s. Normally I don't like endings that abruptly and without closure but I thought Darren ended the way that it deserved, to leave audiences thinking of what happens to Randy and for us to draw our own conclusions to his fate. I loved how the wrestling was portrayed. It was obvious that Darren wanted to portray professional wrestling with as authencity by including an array of real life professional wrestlers.<br /><br />The story of the film may be simple but sometimes less is more. It is depressing however I could not imagine for the story to be anything but one constant disappointment after another in Randy's life. The wrestling scenes were intensely violent and occasionally a bit too much for my liking. Overall I loved The Wrestler.intment after another in Randy's life. The wrestling scenes were intensely violent and occasionally a bit too much for my liking. Overall I loved The Wrestler.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Like many people, I found \\"Band of Brothers\\" one of the best wartime dramas ever. You feel the horror of war from the ground up.  Unfortunately, when on television, I kept catching the episodes out of order.  I eventually saw them all.  The nice thing about purchasing the set is the ability to start at A and end on Z.  I have to guard my purchase.  Whenever we have visitors, they invariably want to borrow my set because they either missed it altogether or saw only a few episodes. Selfishly, I tell them to log on to Amazon and get their own!
B001BR5F4C|5.0|These are must-have blu-rays. The lossless audio track is outstanding, mind-blowing, loud and clear. The picture is beautiful, colorful and very detailed. Moreover, the movies are very very interesting, full of actions and enjoyable dialogues.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|I saw this movie in the theater with my son (age 4) and he sat for the entire movie (unusual) but I thought it was a little slow moving and it is not the best movie Disney put out.  I am a teacher and I show the movie during homeroom (15 minutes a day) to 7th graders and they are so quiet you could hear a pin drop.  They love it!  I personally think it is a Disney bomb - but what do I know?!
031606792X|1.0|Seriously, I don't know why I started reading Twilight and how I possible made it to the middle of the fourth book. I have to laugh otherwise I'll only get angry with myself.    Twilight was the best book of this teenage vampire saga, and still I think I'd only give it 3 out of 5 stars. The characters are dull (with the exception of Jacob, until he imprints with Rosemary's Baby) and have no development.     I have to admit I thought it was just a fun read, and would be good for practicing my english, but I couldn't continue the read on Breaking Dawn. It felt like leaving the show in the middle of a terrible movie. Feels like you wasted your time, energy and money. And for what? Absolutely nothing.    Most of what I think has been written here on the \\"one-star\\" review, but I would like to comment on a few things myself:    1. Seriously, I don't know how even the fans weren't bugged by the way Bella and Edward treated and saw each other. I couldn't stand her telling all the time how perfect he was, how his breath was amazing, his skin was perfect, his farts were roses, and he danced like Mikhail Baryshinikov. I felt like vomiting most of the time.    2. Renesmee Carlie? HAHAHAHAHA. I stopped there. At the end of Jacob's narration. I couldn't continue on reading a book where the psycho lead character called her daughter Renesmee (Renee+Esme) Carlie (Charlie+Carslile). It's nauseating and pitiful. This author should've never been published. I don't blame SMeyer, I blame whoever published her book (at least they're making A LOT of money).    3. Jacob was the only cool character. Why, h god why, did she have to screw everything? The imprinting thing was out of line. No free will? In her universe there's only eternal love that lasts forever and without any doubts or problems. All couples have no fights, are politically correct, and boring as hell.    4. Sex vs violence. It's amazing how people are so ashamed and scared of talking about sex but insist on the violence thing.The are no sex scenes and that's ok. This book is for young-adults, but still, the kisses and holding hands were sexier. And what's the matter with talking a little bit about it, or evening mentioning the word, when you also have the vampire husband ripping the placenta with his teeth? Or Bella first drinking blood like it was tomato juice and then vomiting blood like the Exorcist chick when giving birth? SMeyer needs to rethink her concepts.    5. Did I mention Renesmee Carlie? I CANNOT swallow that!! At least now I'm laughing about it...    6. When they're in Brazil passing for they honeymoon on Island Esme (rolling eyes) Edward mentions the woman superstition about werewolves and calls it \\"libisomen\\". I think what SMeyer meant here was lobisomen. If I'm right here, she didn't even bother with a little research. Nor did her editor (who must be goooooood at what he/she does). We live in the internet era. To make mistakes like this you have to try hard.      If you can, don't even start the first book. Cause it's enjoyable enough to make you think \\"Humm.. I think I'll read the whole saga. I have nothing better to do now\\" ¬¬. That's what happened to me and I feel like ripping these books to shreds.    SMeyer, grow up!

B00065MDRW|5.0|Hello!  Firrst of all I wanted to give it 3 stars but Amazon won't allow me to.  Yes, I'll admit that it was a great album but it's been worn out after all these years... at this point I can't listen once more to Epitaph or In the Court of the Crimson King, it's like listening again to Sympathy for the Devil or Stairway to Heaven... the've been abused...  Frankly I'll take 21st Century Schizoid Man and I Talk To The Wind as the only songs I don't get tired of (Fripp and friends play as if posessed in Schizoid Man and they do it again in Pictures of a City).  As a matter of fact lately I've enjoyed In the Wake Of Poseidon much more... maybe because it was so overlooked... and a hell of a lot more varied (although the structure of the first 3 songs is the same for both albums) but you have to admit that the song In the Wake of Poseidon is far superior to Epitaph or In the Court Of the Crimson King... and let's not even mention Moonchild...  The real masterpiece of Crimson's initial period (first four albums) in my opinion Lizard. It's actually fun to listen to.
0439023483|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It is extremely well written--the characters are well developed and believable and the romance doesn't seem fake or forced (something that bothers me in many other \\"teen\\" books). If you enjoyed Stephanie Meyer's \\"The Host,\\" you'll love this book.

0743564383|5.0|Rave about Hemingway: it's been done.  Complete envy of the power of his dialogue to characterize: wallowing in it (as a writer)    I'm here to rave about the audiobook reader Campbell Scott.  If he does not speak fluent Spanish, he sure fooled me; in the delivery and staccato pacing of dialogue, the pronunciation of names, the perfect accent for each character, and the timing and understanding in general.  The flat affect of the voice of Robert Jordan was perfect as well.  It is obviously written in English but you feel you are hearing, thinking, feeling Spanish, and the formality and structure of the language, and even the \\"obscenity-ied\\" out cursing sound believable and natural.    Other times when a reader attempts accents it comes off as contrived and ends up being farcical, but Campbell Scott does a brilliant job for the voices of each of the characters, from the lightness of Maria to the childlike Joaquin to the solidness of Pilar and the heavy paced tones of Pablo.    A treat to listen to. I will look for other audiobooks Campbell Scott has done the reading for!
0785814531|5.0|This book with everything inside is around eight hundred some pages and a very nice readable book.  The text is not too small nor too large but then again some people may not like it in between but it was perfect for my eyes.  There are a ton of stories in this book so get ready for a lot of reading.  I have not read too many Poe stories or poems before but it was a lot simpler to understand than I thought.  I haven't read Poe since high school about ten years ago so it was nice to go back as an adult to understand it better.  The one problem I had with the book is the name of your current story you are reading is not at the top of the page and instead the name of the book is.  It is a kind of annoying feature that since I don't bend pages or use bookmarks I have come to dislike.  I know I read somewhere someones review with OCD could not stand it and I think I understand why.  For some reason I keep looking at the top of the page and not seeing the name of the current story like a normal book.  That is such a minor gripe compared to the rest of the book considering the vastness and greatness in the book I have come across.  Some stories I didn't know were Poes that I had seen movies of but now I know which is great.  Poe from what I remember lived a somewhat tragic existence but his poetry lives on and maybe if his life was different we wouldn't have his great works.
B0013ND30W|4.0|While the story and songs of Sleeping Beauty don't live up to Disney's best, the animation is wonderful. And in HD, simply stunning. I rented this movie just to take a look and ended up watching it twice, the second time with \\"Cinemagic\\", which uses PIP to display various stills and clips as well as the commentary track(which is quite interesting with Maltin and Lassiter and another Disney animator). Can't wait to see Pinocchio on Blu-ray.

B001G9FFM2|3.0|I got this because i love Iron Maiden and wanted to get their version of \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" (one of the greatest of all Iron Maiden songs). It's good, but if you don't love Iron Maiden it's not really worth getting just for this. You do also get a cover of mettallica's \\"Battery\\" which is solid also.  The DVD has a number of videos, some live footage, and some footage of the filming of the videos and the album.<br />Get this if you really want the extras, otherwise, stick with the regular album which is absolutely fantastic. I'm really rating the bonus features here, the album is 5 stars.
1416562605|4.0|If this is his debut novel, I look forward to reading anything Aravind Adiga publishes. I'm usually a non-fiction reader:  history, politics, science;  I rarely find a novel that will keep my interest for more than a couple of days and more than a few dozen pages.  In fact, every one or two years, I find a novel that I really enjoy reading.  I have to say that, for 2008-09, this is it!!! I only hope Adiga publishes something soon so that I won't have to wait two years for a worth-while novel.<br /><br />I'll skip the synopsis (you can read it from the publisher) but I will say that it is a very easy read, very descriptive, and has dark humor.

0740748475|5.0|First off, I love Calvin and Hobbes, so that may influence my opinion of this collection. I absolutely love this set. It contains every single Calvin and Hobbes cartoon ever printed (or at least that's what it says, I don't have every single strip memorized, but I didn't notice any strips missing). The pages are beautiful and of a nice thick quality. The colors are rich and vibrant. And of course, Calvin and Hobbes are as hilarious as they ever were. The only downside, and it may only be a downside to some people, I don't mind it myself, is the sheer weight of the collection. The books themselves are fairly heavy and when you add all 3 together, the entire collection is heavy.

B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Why Gran Torino?      In this film, Clint Eastwood's churlish character, Walt Kowalski is a retired Ford auto worker who has stubbornly stayed in his formerly white middle-class neighbourhood in Detroit.  Nowadays his neighbours are what we refer to as ethnic, like the Hmongs living next door.  \\"Ethnic\\" for Kowalski, who is Polish-American, means just about anyone who is not.    We soon learn that Eastwood calls his Hmong neighbours \\"gooks,\\" his apparently blanket term for Asians, reminding everyone that he killed gooks during his wartime service in Korea.  But he does not discriminate solely against the Hmongs:  he also has pejorative names for his Italian-American barber and for his Irish-American friend who is a construction boss.  The young priest who has promised Kowalski's recently deceased wife that he will, in effect, look after Walt's soul, is spared the ethnic pejoratives, but his stature and gravitas as a very young priest are thoroughly mocked.    Kowalski's relations with his own family are distant to non-existent. He talks about his adored wife, but admits he has never communicated well with his own children.  Neither is he a doting grandfather.  His dog Daisy is devoted and undemanding, so she is allowed a niche in his life.       Kowalski has a 1972 classic car in his garage, one that he actually worked on in the Ford assembly line.    The Gran Torino was an upscale model produced by Ford in the 1970s.  The name Torino refers to the Italian city of Turin, also an automobile city, where Fiats and Alfa Romeos are manufactured.  So \\"Torino\\" bestows upon the eight-cylinder   American Ford model a racy European cachet.    Kowalski maintains the car in immaculate condition, but he keeps it shrouded and out of sight except when he's washing and waxing it, like a holy relic that is dressed up and viewed only on special occasions.     Thao, the young Hmong boy next door, makes a clumsy and unsuccessful attempt to steal the Grand Torino (part of a botched ganginitiation) and is forced by Hmong tradition to atone for this by working for a week or two for Kowalski.  Kowalski makes it clear this is no favour to him, but he manages to make good use of the boy's time and to teach him some fix-it skills.  Thao is not a willing participant in the gang, and he and his sister are rescued a couple of times by Walt, first because the grizzled veteran does not hesitate to pull out his rifle and shoo gang members from his property.  Later his protection becomes more specific, as he drives the appealing but mouthy sister home in his truck from a confrontation during which she recklessly insults the gang.    Little by little, we see Walt mellowing.  At one point he has Thao help him carry up a freezer from his basement.  He can't drag it up alone; he needs help.  He says he no longer has a use for it and sells it to the eager Thao for a pittance.  This parallels his character's slow melt from the crusty deep-freeze in which he has enveloped himself over the years.    Every time Kowalski wittingly or unwittingly protects the neighbours from gang members, he is flooded by food and flower offerings, gifts of gratitude from the Hmongs, which he attempts to ward off.  Eventually he gives in and accepts them, even enjoying them..  But when gang members perform an attack of enormous magnitude on the family, who are too afraid to go to the police, Kowalski the maverick is not afraid to take matters into his own hands, making sure that the family is protected and his own affairs are in order.     There are other sub-plots which explain much about Kowalski, and which are tied up neatly. .  The movie is not without flaws, but they are relatively small ones.  Overall, this is a very satisfying movie, the kind that makes you want to stand up and cheer afterwards.
B0013ND30W|4.0|This movie looked wonderful in blu-ray. The colors and contrast were amazing. Disney definitely knows how to restore their older classic films for a new generation to enjoy. Now, if they would just redo Little Mermaid, my wife and daughter would be thrilled.
B001KVZ6C0|5.0|Slumdog Millionaire sets a new bar for a great movie.  Although the underlying plot is typical (boy meet girl, boy lost girl, boy search for girl, boy find girl, boy lost girl again, boy meet girl again, then either happy or sad ending), and \\"flashback\\" type of movie has been done a lot before (Memento, Usual Suspect etc), the overall experience watching Slumdog Millionaire is very fresh.  While the movie seems to move very fast, literally (ala Bourne Identity), it explains every details that are important (especially to answer all the questions that exists in the movie). Except one question which I don't think is explained well, on how he is able to get in the Millionaire show. My guess is that because he know what is the optimal way to get through the call center (to call when the host say the word \\"If\\").<br /><br />There are a lot of things happening in the movie (besides the typical plot that I mentioned above, but I don't want to mention the detail as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't watch the movie).<br /><br />This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat, with its fast moving, extreme situations (the slum, and the life as beggars), and intriguing questions. Slumdog Millionaire will keep you guessing (for answers, both on the answer of the question asked in the \\"Millionaire\\" shows, as well as the question on how he knows the answer).  And with all the tragedy and poor condition/quality of life, these people are still able to find some humor (and friendship and love) which helps them to keep going. The acting are also very good and very convincing.<br /><br />This movie should win many awards (and very well deserved too)<br />The soundtrack of this movie is also amazing (mainly M.I.A. and A.R.

B001KVZ6BG|5.0|Slumdog Millionaire sets a new bar for a great movie.  Although the underlying plot is typical (boy meet girl, boy lost girl, boy search for girl, boy find girl, boy lost girl again, boy meet girl again, then either happy or sad ending), and \\"flashback\\" type of movie has been done a lot before (Memento, Usual Suspect etc), the overall experience watching Slumdog Millionaire is very fresh.  While the movie seems to move very fast, literally (ala Bourne Identity), it explains every details that are important (especially to answer all the questions that exists in the movie). Except one question which I don't think is explained well, on how he is able to get in the Millionaire show. My guess is that because he know what is the optimal way to get through the call center (to call when the host say the word \\"If\\").<br /><br />There are a lot of things happening in the movie (besides the typical plot that I mentioned above, but I don't want to mention the detail as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't watch the movie).<br /><br />This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat, with its fast moving, extreme situations (the slum, and the life as beggars), and intriguing questions. Slumdog Millionaire will keep you guessing (for answers, both on the answer of the question asked in the \\"Millionaire\\" shows, as well as the question on how he knows the answer).  And with all the tragedy and poor condition/quality of life, these people are still able to find some humor (and friendship and love) which helps them to keep going. The acting are also very good and very convincing.<br /><br />This movie should win many awards (and very well deserved too)<br />The soundtrack of this movie is also amazing (mainly M.I.A. and A.R. Rahman). O.. Saya, Jai Ho, and 2 versions of Paper Planes..
B001J53X9U|4.0|I gave it 4 stars only because the bat-pod display isnt functional at all, and gets old to look at it rather quick because there isnt anything that you can do with the pod. Plus I have a problem were to display it, but its still sweet and I would buy it again.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Pure and simple James Taylor...what else is there to say?!  I'm not big on Christmas music, but this one I listen to over and over - love it!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The photography in Blu-ray is really awsome.  This is a keeper that we will watch over and over.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|I've been wanting to see this for a while, and finally watched it. All I can say is it's funny, not really laugh out loud for me, but funny as with a grin on my face through most of the movie.<br /><br />There are some cameos that I thought were cool, and the location must've been a challenge to film in. I wanted to compare this to Airplane, but it is not even the same style. The dialogue, though funny, is not full of the wit that was in Airplane. Then again, there are some classic lines that I'll likely memorize the next few times I see it.<br /><br />As for the stars, Stiller plays Stiller. Robert Downey is a real hoot as an Aussie trying to play an American homeboy. Nick Nolte was great as the grizzled old fake sarge that wrote a book the story is based on. Matthew McConaghey is a rip as the agent. Jack Black reminded me of Chris Farley with his over the top antics. However, the most surprising was Tom Cruise. I've never seen him in anything even remotely like that, and I loved it. I haven't been too happy with some of his recent movies, so this was a real treat.<br /><br />The over the top gore was done in a cartoonish way, and is a perfect satire to the gore from many a more serious movie. I also like that they didn't censor the language, and actually talked like people in that situation would talk.<br /><br />The biggest flaw was that the renegade Viet Cong looked like they would be more at home in South America than Southeast Asia. Maybe that was deliberate too.<br /><br />All in all, this is my type of movie. Stupid fun. Now if they'd had an icky bug (monster) in it that ate half the characters, it would have made my five stars. Highly recommended.
B001HXG8PK|5.0|I can't believe I bought this when I already have the limited edition. I rarely buy OSTs but I'm a fan of Hans Zimmer because of the Dark Knight OST so I had to buy it. Yes, not having the tracks properly arranged is annoying but it's so easy to convert to digital format and re-arrange the track order yourself. For sure it's not an ideal solution but what else can you do until they release the Complete Special Limited Edition or whatever it's going to be called?
1400082773|5.0|Once in a great while you come across a book that leaves a profound and lasting impression on you. This is one of those books. Beautifully written and inspiring. After reading this book, I purchased a copy for my 22 year old son who couldn't put it down. This book was more than a present to him, it was a real gift.
031606792X|5.0|This is the final book in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Saga.  It is the longest of the four books, and got a little too sci-fi for me in the middle. The beginning and end are great!  I am a huge fan of the series, and this book did not disappoint.
B001HQZJP2|4.0|I bought these as a gift for my wife who was a big fan of the first 2 movies. I had never seen them before. I must say I enjoyed all of them quite alot. They're just fun movies to watch. I was also very impressed with the quality of the blu-ray picture and sound.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Absolutly incredible, Batman Begins is one of the best films ever. Placed upon the shoulders of Blue-Ray, Batman Begins is even better with incredible sound and amazing picture quality.
B000XPOB0M|2.0|Granted, I'm not that big of a fan of horror movies, I do like the occasional movie that will make you jump. This movie just wasn't that suspenseful or scary. Like 99% of the horror movies out there, this was very predictable and cliched.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|My girlfriend and I watched it about 4 times now and we still sing along and laugh. It is well written, funny, the characters are all unique and the songs are so good that even people who don't like musicals tend to love them! And this DVD is so packed with neat Extras (for example: audition video tapes from fans, a commentary in form of a musical!) that it's way more worth then 10$.  Long story short: Buy this DVD!
B000002BPS|5.0|CD was new (as described).  Shipping took a little bit - but - I received it by Christmas - which was GREAT!
0439882826|5.0|My 5 year-old grandson was surprised and delighted with the functioning light sabres on the last page - it merited a call from California to Texas to tell me...an ingenious addition to familiar pop-up books. Don't spoil the surprise by telling your gift recipient!
031286504X|5.0|The three adaptations of this book are well done but they will never be as good as the original.<br /><br />When the last version was produced I just had to pick up the novel.  I have seen all three versions in film and enjoyed each and every one of them immensely.<br /><br />The novel for me was a real page turner and I could not put it down.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|If you missed \\"Once\\" while it was in the theatres, this Emmy-nominated Best Film and Best Song is a must see. It's a low-budget, sweet story. It's not loud or action-packed and no one is killed. It's a movie and story to ENJOY. The music is wonderful. It's not your typical love story and it's not a \\"girl flick\\" because it's from the guy's perspective.
B00012QM86|2.0|The DVD kept freezing up. The DVD was supposed to be new. I was very unhappy with this product.
0316067601|5.0|Lone Survivor is outstanding. Very well-written and reads like a fast-paced novel. Incredible what Navy Seals go through to get trained and then do as they protect our nation. I loved this book. I also loved [[ASIN:1932172319 Walking Through Fire, An Iwo Jima Survivor's Remembrance]]

1416594884|3.0|Conflicted Ambivalence  I liked, disliked, and became bored with John Le Carre's latest novel A Most wanted Man.  At times it was terrific and read like one of Mr. Le Carre's earlier spy masterpieces, at other times it was tedious and I found myself committing the ultimate reading sin-skimming.  I almost felt I was reading a Dostoyevsky psychological mind- bending  story of spying hell.  Who is who and what is what, and then the climatic finish with more questions than answers.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy international intrigue and espionage and have read most of the great authors but this book left a lot to be desired.  It was almost as if 2 authors wrote it.  The gripping suspenseful author, and the tedious long-winded author.  I refused to quit and eventually finished the book to a most unsatisfactory ending.  Character development had the potential to be outstanding but lapsed in to long periods of superficiality.  Lots of words little beef.  No gratuitous sex, language or violence.  Lots of mind games but marginal at best.  Wait for the paperback or get the hardback at your local library.  All in all it was an average read at best.  There were parts of incredible mind action but these came in between long sections of tedium.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|This is an older movie that my daughter had searched for in video houses and stores locally. I suggested Amazon.com as I have purchased and received unique gifts for family (we have 9 grandchildren). Sure enough you had it online and the cost was very reasonable.    The movie was very entertaining. I'll admit I'm a ET for many shows and movies.
0553582038|5.0|The book was in mint condition, seller had packed it perfectly. It was actually bought as a gift and both of us were extremely pleased.
0393327655|5.0|\\"The End of Faith\\" by Sam Harris is an excellent book.  It gives some explanation for a lot of the problems that are happening in the world today.  Very well written by an obviously very intelligent person.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth is a unique movie. I looked for this movie in so many video stores for years and could not find it. What a surprise to find in on Amazon. I bought this for one of my grown children for Christmas. It was a special surprise, because he loved this movie, very much, as a child. Labyrinth is not only entertaining, but it also teaches a lesson. This is a movie for children and adults alike.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I would just like to preface this by saying that this is my all-time favorite show ever.  I honestly don't feel that there'll ever be as good a show to grace our television sets ever again.  The emotions, hilarity, pop-culture references, & simple \\"small town\\" charm that showed in each Gilmore Girls' episode will forever be cherished and admired for generations to come.<br /><br />I still cannot fathom how on earth this truly gifted show never won a Golden Globe.  All of the characters were simply amazing, but my hat goes off especially to Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel who played the mother and daughter characters with such perfection and grace that one cannot help but view them as \\"real\\" mother/daughter.<br /><br />This DVD boxed set is a definite winner, including all 7 wonderful seasons of The Gilmore Girls and added bonuses and goodies here and there.  This is a must for any Gilmore fan and should be in any dvd collector's library.  This is one of those rare gems that come along once in a lifetime to cheer you up and take you away from the everyday rut of work, chores, or frustration.  Go join the Gilmore Girls in their \\"Little Corner of the World\\".  You'll never wanna look back...

B001GZ6QEC|3.0|The last batman movie was great, this was plain ordinary. Overrated and far too generously reviewed.
B00197U0EY|4.0|Overall it is a great concert, but it shows that it was one of Head's last shows, he felt very apathic. Anyway it's a great buy.
B001IF5YLQ|1.0|Beware, this adapter only passes along a digital signal.  It is missing four pins around the slot that enable it to work with CRT monitors and projectors.  Hence, you can't combine a DVI->VGA adapter with this one.  You must buy a second adapter.  I expected more for $30.
0553582038|4.0|AFFC is half a book and reads like one. Unlike the first three, there's no monumentous event that ties things together. A lot of our favorites are absent, and in their place we get Sam the Fat and Brienne the Bore, and ten chapters of Cersai being stupid. Some signature troupes (such as cliffhangers and prophecies) are becoming overused, and there's an surprising retcon involving Viscerys that Martin probably just thought up at the spur of the moment. POV-wise, the Ironborn could have been reduced from 3 to 2, and Brienne has 9 friggin' chapters devoted to walking around and meeting random people. Kinda like Arya, only not as interesting. While I understand we need to be shown how Westeros has changed (and hasn't), 9 chapters with Brienne is a lot to ask. Especially when we know the journey is futile to begin with. But for all that, I didn't hate the book. The Dornish chapters are thematically strong with a diverse cast, and Euron Greyjoy has the potential to be an awesome villain (albeit not as contemptible as Viscerys or Joffrey, I really miss those little snot-nosed punks). Jaime's transformation from the height of arrogance to... only somewhat arrogant was well done, and keep me reading when the story bogged down. Overall AFFC delivers the goods, but in an atypically meandering and unfocused way. Here's hoping Martin rights the ship with the next one.
143911000X|5.0|It's funny to just flip through and laugh at all the different \\"rules\\" he has set forth. There are a lot of good ones in there surprisingly.
1582701709|1.0|I started reading this book. The concept is quite fascinating an interesting. But it is using a great idea and turning it into an ugly marketing tool with it's seminars. If you want a true in dept idea of the true meaning, read \\"The Law of Attraction\\". The Secret author stole the idea and took away the true meaning.
B001DWNUCO|1.0|It was Shockingly candid in debauchery and graphic sexual content when released on tape in the 80's. One would expect a blu-ray print to further excerbate that effect, if one is inclined to binge in such experience once in a while (or god forbid addictively)but the only thing shocking is the pathetic print. It is worst than an old VCD (leave alone VHS)and selling it on blu-ray is a rip off. Be warned. Jaded and faded...    Iqbal Mustafa
B001KQKC0Q|3.0|I'm a big fan of Nickelback and never thought I would be in a situation where I needed to read a review before making a purchase of one of their albums. To my disappointment, this is probably their weakest album out so far. I've heard the next album is due out in April '09 and I will definitely check it out with more scrutiny before buying it. With a second album release within 6 months, I'm hoping the second is better, but I'm remaining skeptical. \\"Gotta Be Somebody\\" is my favorite on this album. With that said, it's probably the only song you'll find me listening to. I'm still giving 3 stars, after-all, it's still Nickelback, I don't want to trash them completely.
B000LC4ZF8|4.0|My wife received it for Christmas as one of her favorites.  We enjoyed the extra scenes (extended edition) and loved the quality.  Recommend it.
B00005JNS0|3.0|Cars suffers from that common fatal error of many films - the editor didn't (or wasn't allowed to) do his/her job.  Cars, which skirts dangerously close to the 2-hour mark, is simply too long for a kids movie.  Yes, I know the Roger Ebert maxim, \\"No good film is too long, no bad film is too short\\", but my young son gets bored at the 80 minute mark, especially since the hero has been stuck in first gear for the last 60 minutes.    The story: hotshot Rookie Owen Wilson ... er, Lightning McQueen finishes his first season in the Piston Cup circuit in a 3-way points tie with veterens The King and Chick Hicks.  It is decided to have a race-off between the three cars to determine who should win the prestigious Cup.  Off the three cars head to Los Angeles, but Lightning manages to get lost and arrested in Radiator Springs - a one-stoplight town on Route 66, bypassed by the Interstate system and forgotten.  The town's grizzled doctor and circuit judge makes Lightning repair the road he tore up.  As he works in the town, Lightning learns a little about humility, a little about love, and a lot about life.    The opening NASCAR-esque race sequence is by far the highlight of the film for me (and for my son).  The power, the speed, and the sounds of a day at the race track are lovingly reproduced, and even a non-racing fan like myself finds the sequence amazing.  Unfortunately, the middle slows down to a crawl and lasts about 30 minutes too long.  I think the problem is that the creators gave equal time to Lightning's three new relationships in the town - with Mater, the wise-cracking tow truck; with Sally, the big-city Porsche who wanted a slower life; and with Doc (voiced by the late great Paul Newman), the old-timer with a secret.  The film should have been a double-redemption story: Lightning learning what life's all about, while in parallel Doc faces his past and overcomes his bitterness.  If the filmakers had more clearly focussed on this story, and allowed the other two plotlines to recede to subplots, the film would have been focussed and more enjoyable (not to mention cheaper to make!).    So the film only rates a 3/4 for me.  The other star is lost because this DVD edition is not up to the standards of other Pixar and John Lassiter offerings.  While there are some nifty little vignettes on Route 66, NASCAR racing, etc., they are just that: little.  There is no director's commentary either.    Don't get me wrong - there is a LOT to like about this film.  The voices are supurb, as usual.  The races are exciting, the sound is crisp and immersive, and the video is sharp.  The characters are fun and are worthy of inclusion in the Disney pantheon.  But small children will lose interest because the filmakers allowed themselves to meander in the middle 1/2 of the film.

0743497465|3.0|I'll keep this quick and to the point:<br /><br />I read Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code. I enjoy Dan Brown because he tends to write fun, fast paced, easy to ready thrillers. Deception Point lived up to everything that I expected. One thing I did not expect was its predictability and plethora of clich&eacute;s. It didn't ruin the book for me but I did consistently feel like I knew what was going to happen on the next page. If you like other Dan Brown novels, you'll probably like this one too, but it's tough to live up to the expectations set by his other novels.

0066620996|5.0|Hello,  I'm in charge of a large Maintenance organisation and my challenge 9 months ago was to take the business to the next level of sustainability.  I used this book as guideline to choose my Lead Team of 12 people (Right People). My business coach/facilitator and I took the learning's and transformed it into the Good to Great Maintenance concept of developing a 3 year Maintenance Strategy by means of following the hedgehog concept, however we are still working on this and my Lead Team and I are meeting every Wednesday morning for 2 hours for the next 6 weeks.   Thus, we have started to move the old big flywheel and already I can see change in behaviour in the workforce and my union members.   The process is not about change, but instead of evolving into something great without anyone knowing it.  Give me 1 year and I would be able to share more results - my \\"gutt\\" is telling me that this is the right way if you want to have a Constructive Workforce!
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Well, I have been watching Doctor Who since the Jon Pertwee years, and love the show.  At first David Tennant kind of got on my nerves, but I really like him as the Doctor now (ironic as he is leaving)!  I think the main element that made me warm to him so much was Donna!  My husband thinks she is annoying, but I find it refreshing to have a companion who is not all starry eyed and gaga around him.  She is an everyday lady whose life has been touched by this man from the stars.  They are both better for their friendship with each other.    Usually it is the Doctor who takes his love struck companion along and wows her.  This season, however, Donna's humanity and common sense help the Doctor navigate through a series of outstanding episodes.    Every season there are one or two that are just okay, but this season can boast a full deck of fantastic episodes.  They are all well written, well acted (a fine cast of well known Brits fill out all the extra roles), and some are even reminiscent of old Hitchcock films in their spookiness!    Buy this season, and enjoy it over and over again!
0316067601|5.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" is a story on the north side of amazing.  It is an inspiration to anyone preparing to embark on a journey to those dangerous middle-eastern lands, although those who aren't would see it as quite the opposite.  Reading like a Grisham/Clancy novel, the book follows Marcus Luttrell, Matt Axelson, Danny Dietz, and Luttrell's best friend, Michael Murphy into the mountains of the Hindu Kush, where they encounter, and our vastly otnumbered by, the hard and brutal fighting force of the Taliban, under the leadership of Bin-Ladin's right hand man.      Luttrell's optimism is unheard of in today's liberal-led outlook on the war.  For once, we witness the view of someone who has been there, who knows the true dynamic, not just speculating like Couric or Williams.  We owe an immense and profound thank you to Luttrell and his team, who sacrificed more than we could ever hope to, and did it with that dismissive shrug of the duty-bound soldier.        If you only read one book on the War on Terror, read this. Mainly because its more than just another war book.  It's a distinctly human, hardcore American, heartbreakingly detailed, and captivatingly introspective masterpiece of modern biography, one that I judge will be enjoyed and revered for many years to come.

B001GJOL22|5.0|What's to say about Rush that hasn't already been said. I've been a fan of this band since 1980, so obviously my review will be a little biased. The bottom line is this. There is no other band from the late 70's-80's era that is still producing and performing music like Rush is today. Period.     When the Snakes and Arrows CD debuted in the spring of 2007, I could not wait to listen to it after hearing nothing but good things about it. I'm writing this in January of 2009. It's been almost two years that it has been out. It's still in the CD player in my car. I still listen to it on my Ipod at the gym. Snakes and Arrows was by far Rush's best album since Moving Pictures.    What better way to support that album then by touring for two years and playing 110 shows for North America and Europe. I was fortunate enough to see Rush four times on this tour. That makes for 30 times total over the years for me. This tour was the best I have EVER seen them perform, sound and execute. Rush live is a technical marvel that is truly a spectacle to behold. There is no other band on earth like them and there never will be.    The Snakes and Arrows Live DVD BluRay captures the power and intensity of that tour like no other live music DVD that I have ever seen, and that is including all prior Rush DVD releases.    From the opening track of Limelight to the encore of YYZ and everything else in between, including nine, yes, NINE tracks from Snakes and Arrows, this DVD shows how Rush gets it done. It is simply amazing to watch.    The production value of this release is top notch.The HD 5.1 sound  is mixed clear and uncompressed so you hear every little detail there is. The video is about a sharp as it could be, though if I did have to knock one thing about this DVD, it would be the fact that they deliver the video in 1080i as opposed to the slighly clearer 1080p. Still, that is nothing to not get this DVD over.    If you have a BluRay player or a Sony PlayStation3, and are a Rush fan, or just a music fan for that matter, who knows how to appreciate a good live performance, I highly suggest you pick up a copy of Rush Snakes and Arrows Live DVD BluRay. You will not be disappointed.
0307454894|3.0|It was okay. Not great, not awful, just okay. Good story overall and it did offer a lot to think about, but it moved slowly and even dragged at times. Predictable.
B0001I561E|1.0|I am appalled by all the positive reviews.  This movie sends the worst message to children.  Please everyone, strip away the visuals and the catchy music and look carefully at the storyline.  It is about a poor boy who has big dreams.  But rather than trying to work his way up, he resorts to stealing.  Apparently the only way one can succeed in life is by finding a magic Genie in a bottle.  But worst of them all is the princess.  She is a rich spoiled girl who is bored to death, complaining about her life while ignoring the street children eating out of trash cans outside her palace wall.  There are never any indication that these two did anything to help anybody else but themselves.  Shame on you, Disney!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|For those of us who loved Dr. Horrible when it was the internet sensation, I can totally say that the DVD is worth buying.    Better video and sound quality, lots of fun extras and the ability to loan it to others is awesome.    Hey Joss, bypass the hollywood nonsense and just release to the fans.  We'll buy it.
0743454529|5.0|Being in 8th grade, i was 'forced' to read this book for my class. I wasnt expecting a lot from this book. But once i read it I couldnt put it down. The story rocked me to the core, its emotionally gripping as you go through a mind of a 13 year old trying to make the most difficult decison of her life. Whether or not to donate a kidney to her sister. The very topic stir dicusions between me and my friends. The ending made me cry as your heart breaks for the family. I reccomend this book to everyone. You will not regret it
B0000640VO|5.0|Wonderful movie.  I love the style it's shot in, and the story is great.  A worthwhile addition to any movie collection.
0452287022|3.0|I'm not sure why this book has garnered so much attention. There is not really anything special about it that I can tell. It is a quick and easy read and I would only recommend it to someone who asked me for a recommendation of a quick, easy, not bad, not typical chick-lit book. The book is simply average.    Griet's father was once a tile-maker painting beautiful tiles and making a good living, however, an accident at the plant takes his eyesight and he is no longer able to work. This forces sixteen year old Griet to become a maid in a wealthy house.    The master of the house is a painter whom Griet's father respects and with whom Griet becomes infatuated for reasons that are never fully explained, perhaps she cannot even explain them to herself. It is this infatuation that works it way through most of the novel, the driving force behind Griet's actions.    Here's the thing, I didn't particularly like Griet throughout most of the novel. Perhaps it was the bad mood I was in when I was reading it, but I found few redeemable qualities in her and found her to be pretentious at times. While Griet does her work without complaining, it isn't that she doesn't complain because she doesn't want to, it is because it is beneath her to complain, beneath her to draw herself into conversations with the other maid in the house to find common ground. She wonders why the other maid does not like her and attributes it to some kind of jealousy, while this may be true; perhaps the main reason is Griet's attitude toward her position. She may be resigned to it in a sense, but more often than not her thoughts and actions reveal a hint of something else. In this novel Griet comes across as unsympathetic because you only scratch the surface of who Griet is of what her thoughts are--if not, if what you read is what you get-- than Griet becomes simple and close to being one-dimensional.
B001F290E4|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this cd. A big Seal fan and absolutely loved this cd from beginning to end.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This should be in everyones DVD collection. It's awe inspiring, informational, beautiful, and an entertaining collection of documentaries. It's very family friendly.  If this would have came out when I was a kid, I would have totally become either a geologist or a biologist in some form or another.
0312370849|4.0|This is a part of history I knew very little about even though this era is my all-time favorite.  I'm now inspired to read more about these events.  Sarah's story was extremely touching.  My only criticism is that I would have enjoyed reading more of what happened to her later in her life even if it had been through her son's memories.  Julia was a likable character but I just didn't care about her story as much, especially the parts about her marriage (what a colossal jerk of a husband).  \\"Sarah's Key\\" is broken into small chapters that provide an easy stopping place.  It was quite easy to pick up the story again which moved very quickly.  Overall, worth the money and the time.
B00104AYUQ|1.0|No where does this say that it is not for region 1 (USA) It is actualy for region 4 (Austrailia) Grrrr!!!
B0000AMRJD|5.0|One of the most entertaining Pacino movies ever!!!!<br /><br />This film contains all the tragedy of a great opera while offering a taste of early 1980's drug dealing.<br /><br />This movie is not for people with short attention spans.  It is fairly long and involved.  It begins with Tony being interviewed upon his arrival from Cuba to the U.S. and details his rise from a dishwasher to the most powerful drug lord in Miami.<br /><br />The movie offers a good deal of violence but is very well balanced with humor.  It is shocking at times and enjoyable throughout.
B001GJOL22|4.0|I'm a 25 yr Rush fan it's great to see them still rockin' it! All in all, they're still highly creative and though Geddy's voice isn't what it used to be, they still rock and give it everything they've got. Picture and sound quality are amazingly good and be sure to check out the extras which are loaded with older material.
B001GKJ2FM|1.0|I really enjoy seeing Meryl Steep in all her movies. But this movie I am sorry I purchased it. I watched the whole movie not understanding what was going on. I was very disspointed in this movie.
B001J53X9U|5.0|I purchased this with the mindset of having it displayed and it looks fantastic. I even ordered a second one just to keep sealed. By far this is the best movie of 2008 hands down, the acting alone from Christian Bale and the Late Heath Ledger is amazing and they could not have displayed a better performance. This is my favorite Batman movie thus far next to the original with Adam West. A+.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I'm one of the growing John Mayer fans in the world and this CD is a great compilation of some of his current work.  In essence, this CD gives you a quick snap-shot of three of his current musical projects and it doesn't disappoint.  This is also available as a DVD/CD combo that shows the footage taken of the taping of this show.  I caught the show on cable and loved it.  If you're a fan of his music, this is a quality disc for your collection.
006117758X|5.0|This is a great book. It outlines young age in a way seldom seen in film and literature. It is dark, true, and a vivid read, depicting youth in all its colors-- or the ones Chinaski, A.K. Bukowski, \\"Laureate of Skid Row\\", it seems breathed.     It tells young Chinaski's tale from birth to about 20, whereupon, from battling daily a \\"sadistic\\" father, or just living an isolated or pensive, vulgar childhood, he hit the US roads, entering into a sort of Kerouaic, boozy and starved depression-era existence.     The meaning, Ham on Rye, stands for-- that I got from, from [his] friend/editor John Martin, in the film biography on the author Born Into This,-- either the economy-style sandwich, or a ham or showboat-type fellow on rye whiskey. It sums up the tale in a small way.    Overall great read, I read it 3 or 4 times; one of Bukowski's best novels.
0618164413|5.0|my little girl luvs to read, and this book has lots of little stories so i thought it be an aswesome book for her and yes i was right she loves it and reads it every night and now wants another big book like this ...

B000002LQR|5.0|This is the best studio album the Red Hot Chili Peppers have made to date. It has a total of 17 tracks. (the 17th is a cover of a Robert Johnson song called \\"They're Red Hot\\") This album is funky,sexy,sweet,explicit and full of Magik. This album was made right before guitarist John Frusciante left the band (he's back now) but this record had so much commercial success and at his young age John was unable to handle all the popularity that came out of this record being made. Produced by Rick Rubin, this album should be on anyone's top list of CD's to hear before they die. It has something on it for everyone!
B0012GMXLU|4.0|Motorhead's \\"1916\\" is a little different than their older classics such as Bomber or Overkill. While you get the fast and hard-rocking numbers such as \\"The One to Sing the Blues\\" and \\"Make my Day,\\" you'll also see some experimentation with songs like \\"Nightmare/The Dreamtime.\\" This doesn't take anything away from it at all though, and this album rocks as hard as anything else they've ever done. Another thing I must note, is that the title track will leave you feeling a little sad, but in a good way. It is that amazing.     If you like Motorhead, and already own \\"Bomber,\\" \\"Overkill,\\" and/or \\"Ace of Spades,\\" get this album. It's a pleasant surprise that deserves its place in any fan's collection.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|In his 2008 film \\"Changeling\\", director Clint Eastwood presents a ghoulishly and somberly hued portrait of a flapper-era City of Angels that keeps his audience white-knuckled and frequently aghast at yet another chronicled onslaught against basic human decency. Revisiting themes of corrupt misused power, an overall erosion of values and the resulting injustice against the innocent that he has explored in films like `Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)' and \\"Unforgiven,\\" Eastwood creates a microcosm of a larger failed system by focusing on a sad chapter in LA history that revolves around the kidnapping of a young boy. Eastwood interjects a more brutal reality to the already horrendous events that transpired when single mother Christine Collins, a telephone operator supervisor, (a bruised-eyed and ruby-red-rouged lipped Angelina Jolie) discovers that her son, Walter, is missing. The already press-beleaguered police become involved albeit condescendingly,--Jefferey Donovan's performance as the snaky police captain in charge ruthlessly epitomizes how heady a cocktail of pressure from above mixed with the brain swell of power can be--producing another boy in lieu of the missing Walter just to give press closure to the case. When Christine repeatedly insists that the found boy is not her son, she is instantly dismissed as an incompetent, irresponsible mother who during the months the child was missing supposedly became too accustomed to her newfound freedom. The police captain rounds up a group of expert doctors to further his cause and to add insult to injury to this all too true bureaucratic straight-jacket in which Christine finds herself bound.<br /><br />Eastwood drives the film with all the lead-footed ferocity of a Mack Truck crazy with speed. Christine's role as single working mother transmutes to that of emerging female individualist who by reason of her gender is either considered as a trespasser on male employment territory or a hysterical troublemaker requiring sedation to be kept under authority respecting control. As one of the little people who takes responsibility seriously, paying her civic and societal dues with a happy sense of regularity and accomplishment, she discovers that instead of the steadfastness and support she expects from a system for which she has bolstered and paid she receives more than just a negative dividend along with the remnants of her middle class ideals. Her understanding of this reaches a grizzly climax in a bleak cruelly run hospital for the insane and for women that have been incarcerated by the police under the insidious no-questions-asked Code 12.<br /><br />Barring lobotomy, Eastwood pushes all this white-coated terror to the limit--masochistic hospital staff wielding water hoses and administering humiliation-inducing syphilis tests leads to no-win double-talking analysis sessions with sadistic doctors, unnecessary sedatives and the ultimate One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Penguin Classics) depravity, electric shock treatment. Phew! I had to shut my eyes more than once--all that white Gothic starchiness induced a snow-blindness I felt like a kick in the gut.<br /><br />Meanwhile back at the ranch--and what a ranch--in what was once called Wineville in Riverside County--the only ethical representative of the Los Angeles police department investigates a tip regarding the deportation of a minor to Canada and discovers the horrific murder factory of child-killer Gordon Northcott. Here Eastwood steps heavily on the brakes of what up until then had been a fast-moving almost out of control vehicle depicting every depraved manner of humiliation conceivable directed at controlling the drones of the middle class. This break in the action at first seems like the eye of a hurricane, however the film although brutal in its scenes of child killing and capital punishment never hits the mark again as it does in the first ninety minutes.<br /><br />Angelina does the role of Christine justice. Visually beautiful she relentlessly acts up a storm with just a residual hint of some of her former revenge minded characters (think the scary cold-hearted assassin Fox in \\"Wanted (Two-Disc Special Edition)\\") to remind the audience that this is still Jolie that it is watching. John Malkovich plays the helpful radio-minister, Gustav Briegleb, with his usual adept precision while most of the other characters formulate a body of different archetypical stereotypes that are frightening in their bleak presentation.<br /><br />Bottom line? Clint Eastwood's Changeling is fraught with a disturbing energy that bombards the viewer with a stereoscope of images from another era that suggests being back in the day is no better than being around now. Depicting institutions that supposedly are designed to support and enrich the public as greedy citadels of misused power sadly reminds us of our faith in financial institutions that betray rather than pave the way for responsibly planned middle class futures. Recommended with the warning of many brutally depicted scenes of inhumanity towards the insane, child abduction and killing, and capital punishment. Eastwood chills with a razor-honed austerity that is a far cry from the sun-kissed star-studded celebrity of today's LA.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"p a storm with just a residual hint of some of her former revenge minded characters (think the scary cold-hearted assassin Fox in \\"Wanted (Two-Disc Special Edition)\\") to remind the audience that this is still Jolie that it is watching.

B001C08RHA|4.0|This purchase was a gift for someone else but I have seen the movie and it is pretty good.  It is much better than the previews let on.  Robert Downey Jr.'s sarcastic character makes for some great laughs.
0446402397|4.0|Politics, love, a dastardly villian (actually, make that at least two dastardly villains- I don't consider myself a history-buff, but the Stalin reign and the culture of fear it created is truly a fascinating character in-and-of itself in this one.)<br /><br />It's filled with fast paced action, a real mystery, history AND well-developed characters - and it's all woven together with multiple plot lines that are tied together beautifully. Found myself putting off sleep to read \\"just a little more.\\"<br /><br />There was one thing that bothered me.  The author/editor uses dashes and italics in place of quotation marks. This initially made it slower-going for me at first.  But, the story and characters soon captured me, so that I didn't even notice it.<br /><br />BOTTOM-LINE<br />This is just a great, highly recommended read all-around for thriller/mystery readers! (even if, you typically lean towards contemporary instead of historical thrillers).<br />  Comment   Permalink
B00005JKGK|4.0|This was a great dvd and good condition.  Could not find anywhere else and the price was great.  Would have given 5 in the DVD had bonus materials
0439023483|4.0|One of the most memorable stories from my English class (far too many years ago) was The Lottery ([[ASIN:0374529531 The Lottery and Other Stories]]). Now, here's an updated, more in-depth page-turning version of it, combined with a bit of \\"Fear Factor\\"-on-steroids that really does make for quite a ride.<br /><br />I probably would have liked it even more with greater depth to a few of the characters and back story, as well as a more generally meaningful end.  Though that lack may be because it is written for Young Adults.  Still, I highly recommend it for any adult looking for a quick, page-turning thriller with a different premise or anyone who typically enjoys post-apocalyptic tales like [[ASIN:B001IC52I4 The Handmaid's Tale]] or [[ASIN:0316068047 The Host: A Novel]]!
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I was all excited about this movie, but when it started, I thought, oh, this isn't what I expected. I watched the whole thing and I liked it in a strange way. It wasn't what I expected, but I loved the story line. SOOOOO, I watched it again a few days later, this time with the sing along words and it made so much more sense and I loved it. I have watched it over and over again since I got it for Christmas! I love it!!!! I think I've watched it about 6 times so far since Christmas and I could watch it again! It was a little different the first time, but give it a chance and it's one of my all time favorites!!!!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Loud.  Very, very loud.  The music feels a lot like Ride the Lightning.  Less fluff, more edge.  Awesome record.  Buy it, don't rip it.
014028009X|5.0|If you haven't read this book, you should get to it! It's an easy and fun read!
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I first saw this film in a packed cinema and I was encouraged by the response at the end from the audience. They remained in their seats riveted not moving for a considerable period of time and were obviously moved by what they had seen. So many Hollywood films portray schizophrenia incorrectly and those who suffer from this terrible disease as scary, violent, and often not redeeming people. Finally, audiences were able to see a film that accurately depicted this tragedy in a man of considerable intellect.<br /><br />This movie was a breath of fresh air from the likes of Me, Myself and Irene with its perpetuation of the schizophrenia stereotypes.<br /><br />I saw a similar reaction by an audience at the end of the film [[ASIN:B001FWY09Y Cutting For Stone]] when it appeared at the Montreal Film Festival a few years ago. This was the story of a young teen developing schizophrenia who did not do as well as John Nash. What it did show was a more typical example and the two films together paint a realistic image of the disease and its impact.<br /><br />Marvin Ross<br />Author of [[ASIN:0981003702 Schizophrenia: Medicine's Mystery - Society's Shame]]
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Finally!!! I had been waiting for the Blu-ray to be released and since then I cant stop being excited watching the movie.  The best part that enthralled me was the IMAX sequences which looked great on my Full HD LCD TV.  Thanks to the excellent audio quality - 5.1 Dolby TrueHD coupled with the scrore from Hans Zimmer & James Newton Howard which stormed my room and the neighbors ;) as well.  The aspect ratio changes from 2.40:1 to 1.78:1 for sequences shot in IMAX which includes the best scenes of the movie and all aerial shots.  Three cheers to Warner and Nolan..    In a nutshell, The Dark Knight on Blu-ray is a audio-visual masterpiece and a must have in your library.  Moreover we can await further releases from Warner Bro for the title.  Go for it guys
0316017922|4.0|Great insight on why people are successful and why all of us are not as successful as others.
B001B1876G|1.0|I too sat down with my family to watch Iron Man.  It was only once opened and the movie started that we realized that this IRON MAN was an animated version.    Unfortunately as with most there is a regulation regarding exchanges once the packaging is opened.    At least now the price of this annimated cartoon nightmare is $10 dollars less so you might be warned you arent getting what you expect.    Good luck with trying to get a credit... I think with speaking to the right customer representative they might realize that with the \\"customer satisfaction\\" consideration this is an advertising and labelling issue and the customer should not be held liable for such misleading labelling.
B00004YB9Y|4.0|I had listen to this album, when it first came out and I loved it, unfortunately was on a cassette form, which I no longer own, when I noticed that you had it, I couldn't miss the opportunity to hear it again...Is one of those Christmas album that really gets you in the spiritof the holiday season.
B001DD63UO|5.0|I gave this to my 14 year old niece for Christmas.  She loves it.
B000SW4DSA|5.0|I cannot get this to work on my computer.  I gave it 5 stars because I think the show is clever, witty, interesting, compelling and completely worth getting and watching.  However, no matter what I do I cannot watch the episode.  I'm very glad I only ordered one episode at a time since I am basically out the $2.  Just order one episode at a time to make sure it will work on your system.
0312427646|4.0|This charming little book should be required reading for anyone who enjoys reading and writing, understands British humour and doesn't mind fun being poked, gently, at Queenie and her brood. Bennett's past and current contributions to the London Review of Books, where the content of this book appeared first, make him one of England's memorable men of letters, and he writes much better than some of the Names (you know who they are and many are vastly overrated).<br />TUR is a quick and easy read that evokes many memories of Britain and reminds one of some of the quirks and absurdities of Royalty. It also convinces one that the life of the Monarch is a lonely one, that of a bird in a gilded cage longing (if one accepts Bennett's charming conceit) to fly. There isn't a dull page in it.<br />One aspect of the book is mystifying and reduced my rating: the price. $12 retail, for a book that is only 4-1/2\\" X 7 and 120 well-spaced pages long, is too much. Evidence may be found in the offering of new copies at less than half the price.<br />Bennett remains a memorably fine writer. It's worth subscribing to the LRB just to read his Diary, and the memory of seeing Maggie Smith dazzle the London theatre audience with her portrayal of his THE LADY IN THE VAN is yet another confirmation of his remarkable skills.
0891419195|5.0|I can only say that this is possibly one of the best books on war I have read. E.B. Sledge writes a powerful and descriptive narrative of his time fighting the Japanese during the USMC's Island Hoping campaign. It was interesting and refreshing to hear a point of view from an junior enlisted man because many books are written by officers or staff NCO's. I highly recommend this to fans of the HBO series The Pacific, (Since this is some of the source material) history book fans, fans of war novels or just readers in general. A very emotional and gut wrenching narrative.
