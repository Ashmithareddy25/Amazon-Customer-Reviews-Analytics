B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really cute and super fun. It is easy to use and the tutorial is great. I would recommend. it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This one is one of my favorite games. it will suck in and before long you will find yourself looking at flowers a little differently. Very fun and ingenuitive. would recommend for anyone interested in losing a few hours.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|All Jack Ryan and Jack Ryan, Jr. books are very exciting.  I have been a Tom Clancy fan since his first book and now read all his books on Kindle.  This is my 26th Tom Clancy book that I have read from my Kindle.  I feel as if I know all the characters.
B006O3MU96|4.0|This game is pretty much just the and extension of the doodle jump game, which i thought was fun and entertaining. can't find much wrong with the game except the if you are good at the original then you will be good at this one. Fun for a redo.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is awesome and admittedly addicting. I love everything about it except two things. One, there should be more ways to get gold. And two, you should be able to buy food with coins. My cousin and brother both love this game and we all play at least once a day.#Dragon #Awesomeness
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|The show keeps moving. Funny who lame these two guys are. Keeps you wondering how long Walt can keep this a secret
B001EYU1VO|5.0|I got this for Christmas a few years ago because I had really gotten into Flight Simming. This thing is THE PERFECT JOYSTICK if you want to get an all-in one, affordable control system.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />TONS of Buttons. On FSX I use them for Throttling, Flap adjustment, landing gear, tailhook, brakes, differential brakes, speedbrakes, lights, and view switching. The twisting function works well as a rudder and if you're like me, you don't even need it that much except for ground steering (I seldom use the rudder when flying).<br /><br />Easy programming- and if it gets sensitive/sticky you can adjuts it.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This movie was the best though i felt they should have interviewd all the satrs but the movie is a -1
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It starts a little slow, but don't put it down!!! This is an amazing story of survival, suffering and endurance. I would recommend it to anyone ready for an adventure. Pi survival is truly a gift from God/s
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book, I just finished it & I'm tempted to read it again because it was so amazing
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Another hilarious movie by this duo.  I have watched this more than 10 times and still can't stop laughing.  This movie is ranked up there with the great Young Frankenstein.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Since I purchased this CD it has been in near constant play. A beautiful album. The harmonies of their voices and arrangements are incredible. I highly recommend this album. It is the best album I've purchased in a long time.
B009MF56GC|4.0|I loved this movie.  It was a lot of fun.  (spoiler) I thought the think with the dead sniper kid was not necessary and if it was not for that I would give this five stars.  I loved the chemistry between all the actors.  The silly things, the crazy action The funny things painted on the custom A-Team style planes and siege vehicles.  I am so ready for the third movie.  Part of my dream add on cast members I'm actually getting (Jackie Chan) but if I could beg the gods of movie making I would have to ask for Mr. T and Lucy Lawless
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and good for passing time it has a lot of challenges and you can earn the coins for free or you can buy them it is great 131 games in 1 app it is awesome you should get it
B009CPJHY4|4.0|It was a fun movie without being too  naughty.  My husband and I watched it together and we were both entertained.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing. It was a romantic but suspenseful book, and it always had me at the tip of my seat trying to find out what happens next. Again amazing, and I recommend it to anyone;)
B005HSL626|5.0|It is a good game! If you are looking for a game, you should get this game! 5 stars for it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome looking forward to the next book . This book has followed the story line well and make you want for the next.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is a interesting and cool game! You should try to play it! I rate it 5 stars! Get it.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|What a remarkable performance by Meryl Streep, who literally disappears and becomes Ms. Thatcher. This film showed the private and sometimes frail side of the former Prime Minister, as well as her relationship with her husband, which was heartbreaking at times. Well-paced, interesting, and a very, very human portrayal by Streep. Will watch again soon.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books!!!!! I truly enjoyed the storyline. I loved that the story evolved, it just wasn't completely based on sexual content.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|As others have noted, if you watch this as a different film and do not compare it to the older movie with Arnold you wont be disappointed. 2 different versions of the same events is all. Just enjoy.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|This includes the best songs from the movie! I can't get enough of it! I listen to it over and over again, particularly the Barden Bellas Finals number. If you couldn't get enough of the movie but don't have time to sit down and watch it over and over again, get this soundtrack so you can at least have the music on the go!
B0094KTBBG|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it. Every time I watch it, it still gets to me. The characters are interesting and realistic, the side gags are funny, and the story has a message but isn't too heavy handed with it. All in all, a fun way to spend an hour and a half.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A compelling thought provoking story, a little unsettling but a can't put down book.  It makes you wonder how any parent can really know their own child.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|You'll immediately recognize every character, including yourself.  The issues will have you shaking your head in agreement.  This is a work of semi-fiction that everyone in IT has lived at least once and wants to avoid again.  Well researched with references to some of the most important works in operations, not just IT, The Phoenix Project tackles some of the latest thinking in the field wrapped in an engaging and enjoyable read.  This is a great way to start the conversation around DevOps and organization changes without putting a stack of books in front of the team.  Once they've torn through this they'll be looking up Allspaw, Goldratt, Deming, and others.  Great job Gene and team!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. The characters could have been real people and their issues were certainly real life ones. The story line was one that was believable; it brought back memories of being a teenager. Highly recommend reading it!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game has a great story,  great clues and the objects are not terribly hard to find.  Loved it!  Couldn't put it down.  Alawar makes great games and they really are free. That's a plus!
B000FC13MM|5.0|I sat down many years ago and  randomly picked up this book. I read through it in one sitting, and it is is truly my favorite. I still wish there would have  been more  than the three in this trilogy, such as other stories in the same world. Some more stories from the Old Kingdom would be greatly appreciated. This book lures you in and leaves you wanting to know more about this magical world.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is by far the most interactive and fun of all the inexpensive hidden objects games. Not only does it have more levels, but it uses different methods of identifying the objects to be found. Relaxing fun for adults. Learning tool and enjoyable for kids.
1118232658|5.0|Socialnomics is a great book for anyone who wants to understand the impact social media has on our world today. It covers not only how businesses can utilize it effectively, but also how consumers are using it and why. And understanding the \\"why\\" of the audience will help any business successfully leverage social media's benefits. But what I really like about the book is that while it explains this on a higher level, it uses interesting and easy to relate to examples to illustrate the point and bring it to life. This allows the reader to easily correlate it to their own real world experiences. You don't have to be an expert in online marketing or have an MBA from Harvard to understand this book - it is really for every business person who wants to learn what social media means to them, their business and this world.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  I had never read anything by this author and I was pleasantly surprised. There were so many unexpected twists and turns in the plot that I couldn't put it down.
1451688091|5.0|surprised at the girth of the book.  have started reading and am pleased with the attention to historical valuing of place and events.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book.  It started off as a classic whodunit with a weak, yet loving wife and an extremely flawed, equally wak husband.  Then Gillian Flynn begins to reveal the truth of the 'love' story.  The reader sees the true color of both characters. Its a commentary on how people can be manipulated by each other, the media and our need for love no matter how sick. It was a fast read, very entertaining with an edning that mnay find upsetting but somewhat true to life.  Justice does not always prevail.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Awesome, a real page turner. Really didn't know the real killer of the judge until almost the end of the book.
B0011TNVLY|4.0|I wanted a cd of this movie for my 5 yr. old grandaughter...I do not know how to down load this and copy it for her:( Please help!

B007ZXK08C|5.0|...........then look no further. This is an excellent story that results in a gripping thriller. Read this before they make the movie.
B004XZR63M|4.0|If only all high school students could read this book. It would change, entirely, our thinking on preparing young people for life.
B003O86FMW|4.0|really enjoyed this second part of the Hunger Games triliogy. It has a great pace and will keep you interested all the way through, looking forward to starting the final book in the trilogy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a great game and time waster but they don't give a lot of options for your horse/horses but its still a great game!
B0091REZMW|1.0|App sucks....you run out of energy and diamonds and they want you to pay for some fake Diamonds!!!  I think NOT!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Although the writing is so-so, the story is fantastic.  Would definitely recommend this book to others.  A+ to EL James.
8866130915|5.0|This is my third year to use a Moleskine 'weekly' planner. Love it, love that each week there is space for daily stuff and a page for notes or to do lists etc. This is my first time to get the smaller one and I love it, fits in my bag/purse so I always have it when I need it.
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|The soundtrack to the Lord of the Rings was routinely chill-inducing for me, and I was not disappointed by that of The Hobbit. It probably even exceeded my expectations!
0780626494|5.0|fAVORITE TV MOVIE GOOD CLEAN FUN, DIFFERENT WAY OF SEEING A PERIOD OF TIME.  SISSY SPACEK  AWESOME. COULD  SEE IT HAPPENING
0545128285|3.0|The idea is so fun for this book, and many of the stories are great.  But there are a few that are wildly inappropriate (in my opinion) for children.  One story has a man literally ripping hearts out of people.  I suppose that knowing it contains the Deathly Hallows story should have tipped me off that it's not for kids, but it also contains Babbitty Rabbitty, so it's a bit perplexing.  Who is the intended audience?
B00062IDCO|5.0|I NOW HAVE ALL 7 SEASONS OF VOYAGER,YES IT IS A SMALL INVESTMENT, HOWEVER WITH ALL TH B.S. THATS ON TV THESE DAYS ITS NICE TO WATCH A CLEAN SHOW.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Train has such fun upbeat music. I love listening to it at work or in the car. Makes the workday go quickly.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I could barely put this down until I was done reading all three. All in all these were a very good read.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|A great film. Really well done and I would recommended it to anyone. Clean, shows the beauty of music.<br />\\"August Rush\\" is a wonderful film that shouldn't be missed!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought the first half of Gone Girl was a exciting, interesting and kept me engaged. About half way through the book, things starts to fall apart. I thought the set up was great, but the big reveal comes to early and it becomes a chore to finish. Could have been great.
B0086700CM|1.0|this app ducks you cant do anything everything looks really cheesey and only if you buy it you fang get color combanations other wise you choose one Color and tap it it also reminds you to do everything so do me a solid and don't buy this app
B009KYXEY6|5.0|The CD arrived in perfect condition and I was able to play it on my player just fine;<br />I love every single song on the CD as well
B002M9WW30|3.0|First off let me just clear up one thing, Rocky movies are one of my personal favorites!! I love every single one of them with exception to 5 which i thought was just bad! But my rating of 3 stars is strictly on this bluray transfer which i personally think is an insult to such a great franchise. The quality on these movies are terrible for being what it is, as far as the franchise on its own i give it 5 stars! Definitely worth the upgrade to bluray if your looking for slightly better quality but if you have just regular dvd's the difference is not overwhelming. Also the menu's in these movie are the cheapest ive seen for being bluray transfer's except number 6 (R.Balboa) which on every level was better including menu and special feature's and quality!!!
B006YTTVHO|1.0|Not very helpful.  Basic common sense.<br />If people don't know this information already, they would not have made it out of middle school.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great, able to get my email on kindle fire.  Shows up just like on iPad.  Would highly recommend for Fire
B00022LRXA|5.0|As it often goes with success, critics & fans alike will always make comparisons with any follow-up work, or in the case of Eno, any release after 'Another Green World'. Perhaps I'm even perpetuating it here.<br /><br />However, 'Before & After Science' is Brian Eno's 1977 masterful follow-up to the seminal 1975 'Green World'. Over the many years I've gravitated to this work more insatiably than 'Green World' mostly due to it being a far clearer & more direct musical recording. With the exception of the galloping funky beat of 'No One Receiving', 'Science' doesn't sound like a 70's LP.  The instrumentals are pristine clear & luscious. The up-tempo tracks like 'King's Lead Hat' have a progressive timelessness.<br /><br />Narrowing down some 100 tracks to this, as well as immersing oneself in the historic midst of Bowie's 'Berlin Trilogy', Eno pulls out of his hat a beautiful anti-'Heroes' work. This is his genius. Soon he would finalize his unique position in the music world with his first declared, official ambient recording, 'Music For Airports'.<br /><br />'Science' is a rare gem of the 70's, unparalleled to anyone in the rock-pop field. 'Green World' came from off the grid. 'Science' put Eno in his own orbit for the many decades to follow. Art is art, not science, no matter in what orbit Eno may be found.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|She has watched them more than once since Chistmas.  She loves them and we do too. The set was a good purchase.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Absolutely no redeeming value, no worthwhile story, and most of those guys are too old for this stuff.  Not worth your time.
B00003CXDD|5.0|If you cant get enough of the 80s, get this movie! The story was done by George Lucas and it is a model of what us 80s children miss from the good ole day! ++its totaly racist towards little people (peck)!
B0086700CM|5.0|aunque no soy muy amante de los juegos, en muy raras ocasiones como cuando voy de viaje me gusta tener uno agradable y entrenido en mi kindle o en mi telefono
B005JABSB6|5.0|This glasses is excellent, make looking at 3d movies awesome, it is much much better than the other brands I look and try out at the stores, do not think twice might be a bit pricey but worth every penny!

0525478817|5.0|Simply amazing!<br />Very well written and with characters that seem very real. You're happy when they're happy and you're heart breaks with theirs.<br />I honestly think that this is John Greens best work yet. This book touched me in a way that hasn't happened in years. The bar has been set very high.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|The best part for me is the music- its very haunting.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />Favorite part was the sea monkeys. They were super creepy and had us cracking up.
1118232658|5.0|Erik is THE go-to expert for all things social! I reference Socialnomics often as the head of marketing at a tech company. It's the timeliest and most informative book I've read on the business impact of the social economy and it includes a wealth of useful real-world examples and compelling case studies. This book is a practical guide for anyone wishing to truly harness the power of social media to grow their business. Read it and you'll agree.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good game yayyyyyyy makes me happy its nice fun cool swoop happy goody gumdrops hamburger join man. may mad. mean. mood. mal
0345803485|1.0|This book is so bad,  I'd rather  have my teeth drilled than finish it.  A few points to the author:<br /><br />1.  Study geography before you include it as part of the story.  If you are driving from Vancouver  to Seattle you don't embark by heading toward Portland.  I-5 ( in the vicinity of Seattle )  is a parking lot for most of the day you don't and can't drive as fast as you can when you hit it.<br /><br />2. You don't ask someone a few inane questions and have a 'good' story to run on.<br /><br />3. Tylenol and NyQuil do little to combat Influenza.<br /><br />4. Masking tape breaks easier than toilet paper.  It would not do much good in an S&M ritual.<br /><br />5. Princeton University does not have a business school.<br /><br />6. No one blushes 300 times in 17 pages.<br /><br />7. You don't have to add an editorial comment to every spoken word.<br /><br />How this novel sold 50 million copies is a miracle.  It is horrible.
B004EK926K|5.0|Great movie, even as an adult you will enjoy this movie. Jim Carrey did very well in doing the voice of Scrooge and the animation was brilliantly done.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I liv this app cuz it really works but the only CON is that its kinds slow when u first PURCHASE the app...but that may be only my kindle fire
B004U8VWIM|5.0|Sat down to watch this not expecting to find out the things about Natalie Portman's character that you do. The plot points kinda shift around and at the end you sit there going &#34;Oh my god, that was good.&#34;
B0055SWM08|4.0|I rated it not one or two or three or five. So that only leaves FOUR  unless I Miscounted okay
B000NQRE1E|5.0|The picture is absolutely stunning in blu-ray. I never thought this movie could get any more visually stunning, but they achieved it somehow.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|the graphics are nice and the game fast paced; I like it. even in simple mode the game is fun.
0316223239|5.0|Stunning. \\"Room\\" by Emma Donoghue shocks you from the moment you read the first<br /><br />page. Its contrasting nature shows a very dark situation from an innocent child's point of<br /><br />view. To this child, to Jack, everything is as it should be: bright,<br /><br />comfortable...and the same. Englosed in un-escapable Room, Jack and his Mother have<br /><br />been entertaining themselves since Jack's birth, on Carpet. Now that Jack has turned<br /><br />five, Mother tells the truth about the world, a big \\"other\\" place, outside of Room.<br /><br />Jack can't even imagine.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|An excellent and well written book! I would and have recommended to all my friends.I would like to see it in the movies soon as well!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great value for a great collection of blue rays. Wasn't expecting to receive it in the mail till after Christmas, but it came early, and was here by Christmas. Woot!

B009KHDT0C|3.0|If you like Johnny Depp's character acting and you were ever into the original Dark Shadows, then this is a fun romp. Updated, with some smart moments of dialog.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Interesting and enchanting story of peculiar children and their fight to survive. I am interested in what a sequel has in store.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|As a Borne fan and a  Jeremy Renner fan and movie was very disappointing. there was some good action scenes but the ending was really anticlimactic
B00004TS0E|5.0|Mara Wilson is adorable in this movie about a little girl who believes in Santa Claus despite being told he doesn't exist. I like the original movie but this movie I really love.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|works great . Love it! no complaints . no issues . loads data as fast as it should . no drag or delay
B00133KHCY|5.0|this is the heart touching story about a wonderfully special boy who was given up for adoption at birth. he always believed that someday his parents would come back for him. when his parents fail to find him he goes out into the world to find them. this movie will make you remember dreams really can come true.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a great packaging of a fantastic movie. I can truly place this among the top superhero movies of all time! It's a wild ride! For those of you who are unfamiliar with the biggest movie of 2012, take a bunch of solo heroes, mash them together with an invading alien force threatening to destroy the world, and you have a blockbuster of a movie!. Great writing, solid performances from the entire cast, and a great Easter Egg at the end of the credits that was a laugh out loud scene! While it helps to have seen some of the other movies, it's not a must. Anyone who wants to get a background view of the characters needs to see Thor, The Incredible Hulk (Not Hulk from 2003), Captain America, and Iron Man.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I am new at having this app. but so far I am enjoying this way to see what I will face when I head out to work. Good graphics.
B002APU580|5.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen<br />Thematically the story slowly builds and leaves the reader at multiple climaxes throughout the book, first with the introduction of Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley at the town ball. Then leaving the reader hanging with the decision of Mr. Bingley to hold a ball and share his feelings to Jane all to have him leave based on the advice of Mr. Darcy. The book takes the reader on a rollercoaster to keep the hope continuing and keep things interesting.<br />The tension between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie is unremarkable, whether it be her interest for him at the ball but him clearly ignoring her because he thinks that he's too far above her socially. In the end she has too much pride to accept his love once he declares it for her. They can barley stand seeing each other after that but she misses his attention and affection and soon realizes what a good man he is and soon addresses her love for Mr. Darcy once she finds out everything he did for Lydia and also convinced Mr. Bingley to return and ask for Jane's hand in marriage.<br />Elizabeth's obvious hatred of the privileged gives way to her pride and lets it get in the way when she realizes that she is starting to have feelings for him. Her character seems rather angry in her own way and even a little bitter that has a woman she has to marry someone in order to not be a burden on her family. This really gives the reader a window into the independence that she wants to have and how torn she is to give in to her independence if she declares her love for Mr. Darcy.<br />I agree with all the reviews of pride and prejudice but I wish the first one would have elaborated on the two different views of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth who both realize they love each other when the other does not at that point in time. That their pride and attitude get in the way because they don't want to give the wrong impression and she is always so witty and intellectually superior. However, they are correct in the way that Mr. Darcy still tries to show is love in secret just because he wants Elizabeth to be happy and have no problems in her life.<br />Jane Austen still is really summed up in \\"let it be yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of you\\" representing his never ending love for Elizabeth even knowing she had said she did not feel the same way prior to this discovery. I love this quote because it just shows his hope that maybe she loves him back so he must tell her how he feels. It represents his passion and shiverlious behavior in order to just make life easier for her.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance novel, the setting of the novel and the independence of a fierce young woman fighting her own feelings is thrilling and makes the read even better.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|This review contains some spoilers:<br /><br />What I liked about the movie:<br /><br />1) This really is a \\"feel good movie,\\" and I would probably watch it again. It has a happy ending.<br />2) I enjoyed the time travel aspect of it, especially the era of the past on which it focused (the 1920s----love the music, fashion, etc.)<br />3) Despite how cliche and unrealistic it was (see #1 in the next list), I liked the scenery. The scenery fulfills most Americans' romantic ideas of what Paris should look/be like.<br />4) I enjoyed laughing at Paul, the pedantic character. (Don't we all know somebody like him?).  The scene where he argues with the tour guide is priceless!<br />5) I liked the art/literary allusions; watching this felt kind of like a movie version of Jeopardy where I kept trying to identify the characters and allusions.<br /><br />The film's problems:<br /><br />1) The film is rife with cliches:  From the protagonists' obsession with walking in the rain to the overly romanticized portrayal of Paris to the in-your-face personalities of some of the famous writers & artists, parts of the movie lacked originality. (Perhaps Allen was trying to portray Paris in the overly romanticized way that Gil sees it??).<br /><br />2) The conspicuous yet confusing treatment of the theme. We are almost hit over the head with the movie's \\"message\\" toward the end. However, the epiphany Gil has about overly romanticizing the past is confusing as \\"the\\" theme for the movie since the pedantic character expresses the same view and we're meant to think he's a jerk.  So is Allen trying to say that we tend to romanticize the past and shouldn't or not?<br /><br />3) The caricature-like portrayal of the bratty fiance and her conservative Republican parents (of course, being Hollywood, it's almost a given that the bad guys will be Republicans/conservatives).  This, like the theme, could have been handled with a defter hand. Because of how superficial Inez was, I found it hard to believethat she and Gil would ever have gotten engaged. That made the entire basis of them being in Paris unrealistic for me.<br /><br />I think all the actors did a good job.  I disagree with some reviewers who believe Wilson's performance was dry. I think he did a nice job. Clearly, Wilson is playing the typical type of guy that Allen himself always plays in his movies (somewhat confused, trying to make sense of his life).  Since Allen is too old for the part, he cast Wilson.<br /><br />Overall, I think this movie is worth watching.
B005LAII12|5.0|I liked it a lot. In fact, I have pruchased two more to give to friends and relatives. I wacthed it twice already!

B004LWZWE2|5.0|This collector's edition is well presented in an excellent package.  I would thoroughly recommend it as something special to add to any collection, even if you're not an avid AC/DC fan.
B007N85POS|5.0|I got this game because angry birds rio is on my laptop and may be my favorite version of this game.  In the computer version you started with 3 sections of this game available to be played..  My only gripe with the kindle version is that you only start with one section and if you don't win easily you get stuck without other alternatives to play and it is VERY frustrating.
B00008EY7H|5.0|Of course this is not as good as being there in person, but it's still an amazing experience to watch the talent of these artists in such a professional setting.

B004I744AS|3.0|Its advantage is that it contains multiple languages.  The several initial bits of I co that come up (quotes or people or word of the day etc) are unnecessary and not to my preference but I can ignore that and go on to my search.
B007MG360G|1.0|This &#34;game&#34; does not make sense.  I do not understand the point.  It is stupid, not entertaining and not worth wasting even a $1.99
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its such a great game I cant get enough of it. I play it almost everyday and if you rate it you get 5 gems so rate. my horse great is so amazing.I can also compete in computations
B009WO7NQO|3.0|This game looks great but is only ok.  The star wars characters are done amazingly well,  their weapons are genius, Luke Skywalker's light saber, Obi Wan's ability to use the force.  Now, I have given the other angry birds games I have 5 stars.  I did not give this game 5 stars for the following reasons: 1.  all the other games I have, you are able to shoot the bird as far as you need to, even completely over the targets; this game you can barely get the characters 1/4 of the way thru the scene, it is extremely frustrating and I wish this could be fixed. 2. because you are unable to shoot the characters where you need them to go, you are stuck purchasing the millenium falcons to do the shooting for you and if you can't get them targeted far enough into the scene they don't succeed either and you waste money. 3. Princess Lea's power is not very useful because you cannot get her to a place where she can be helpful.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|LinkedIn is my favorite social network and feels like the most useful of the bunch. This app works really well. The only problem with it is if you try to add a connection from the app, it doesn't let you add a message (at least I haven't figured out how to if it does let you).
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was awesome<br /> Ithought it was absolutely fearsome the words were amazing  excellent word choice throughout the story it was absolutely absract it was awe inspiring i think it was one of the very best books i have ever read
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I really liked this movie, but I purchased this based on the claim that the DVD had a commentary as well as some special features. Not a one. I have this on iTunes with all the special features but the commentary so this was a waste of money for me. Amazon REALLY needs to specify whether or not the commentary exists on both the DVD and blu-ray.

0765325950|4.0|Sadly I am already finished with this book. I wish I read slower. I loved the book read it 3 times now, but lets be honest we have all wanted the last book for ages and would have read it even if we had to read it off the back of cereal boxes. I don't feel it was as good as I hoped for but I find Brandon Sanderson writing a little less in time with the story than previous books he has written in finishing off this story. But that being said it fills in all the holes and wraps up the series well. It does not in my opinion wrap up the after part very well it left me with a sense of ok so what will go on now with very little to draw conclusions on ... sorry if that sounds a little vague I don't want put details and spoil it for anyone ... But all said IT IS A GREAT BOOK and a series to read.
0425252868|5.0|I have read hundreds of books over the years on World War II, both the horrors and the heroics of men from all countries.  Adam Makos puts a face on the fighting men of the B-17 379th Bomber Group and the Luftwaffe they faced over Europe.  The story of Charles Brown and Franz Stigler from young men to hardened warriors is a riveting masterpiece.  Excellent factual information on both air forces, additional information on the leadership of both air forces lends great background information to keep things in perspective.  I have enjoyed many great books and this rankes as one of the most enjoyable.  A great book for me is one that when you reach the last page you turn to read more...  Kudos' Mr. Markos.  The Greatest Generation had great men on both sides.
B0092ZEIN4|2.0|I was looking for a bluetooth gamepad to use with my android device, I have a few games that were supposed to be gamepad enabled, like grand theft auto and modern combat.<br /><br />This controller seemed like a good deal until I got it. It's pretty disappointing actually, the analog nubs are ridiculously uncomfortable. They have too much resistance so your thumbs will be sore after using them, since they're made of hard plastic.<br />The shoulder buttons are awful, they are too mushy and you're not really sure when you press them or not. The triggers are ok, though I don't have any games that use them as an axis (pressure sensitive) so I don't know how well they work for that.<br /><br />The face buttons are good, they have a nice push to them and you know when you hit them.<br />The dpad is much too mushy, which is a shame because it fits in the thumb very well.<br />Often you'll accidentally hit &#34;down&#34; on the dpad because it's so sensitive, on the contrary, Up is hard to register a hit on.<br /><br />The main draw for this controller too was the promise of &#34;touch mapping&#34; which I assumed meant you could record touch-macros to map to buttons on the controller (which would enable you to use it with ANY game, since it would emulate screen touches).<br /><br />This is a feature they advertise the unit as having, but it does not exist. When you download the Nyko app you get a lovely message telling you &#34;It's coming in the future, this is a beta&#34;, and the app has apparently never received an update in the store.<br /><br />Overall I'd say spend a few bucks more on better hardware.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|This is a self wound watch using the movements of your wrist/arm/hand to keep it running.  I guess I didn't set it exactly right at first since it's a little confusing with minimum 'other' language day names, but I also didn't 'shake' it up enough to stay running overnight and the next day it was dead.  The next day - same thing.  So I re-set it completely and shook it for well over a minute and it lasted overnight.  Still testing ti this way to see if it'll cooperate and keep accurate time.  I really like the outer ring for reading minutes wihtout putting my glasses on to see the details.  It's a nice looking, simple, old style watch.  It would be nice if the inner ring had the hours in roman numerals!
B00005KAQP|5.0|can't say anything besides the fact now I can watch it whenever I want to! And then I can put in SA 2!

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Took me a bit longer to get into than Gone Girl, but another good suspenseful book. I like her writing.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Finally, a refreshing page out of the \\"turn of the millennium musical motion picture genre\\" book.  Very funny, but the musical selection and accapella compositions are enjoyable and believable. A must-see for any musician, or pop-music fan!

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|MY SON AND I ACTUALLY WATCHED THIS AND WE REALLY LIKED IT. IT WAS A NICE CHANGE FROM WATCHING STUFF LIKE CARS AND TRAIN MOVIES HE USUALLY LIKES TO WATCH. THE CHARACTORS ARE VERY ENJOYABLE AND THE PLOT VERY CUTE
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game. very addictive.  hard to put down once you start playing. has realistic needs to be completed. fun fun.
B000FC10WU|5.0|Anything written by Agatha Christie is great!  If you like who dun it books...buy this one!  It is hard to put this book down.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|new update refuses to install on my kindle fire and droid charge phone. would give the 4 stars when this is fixed.
0812993292|5.0|I read this book in all of two days, which says a lot considering I have two children under the age of 5.  It had me laughing, crying, gasping and genuinely captured by the story and its characters.  I am the type who is always trying to guess the end and while I am normally pretty great at it, this one had me altering my guesses all the way til the end.  It was a charming story and will be looking for more titles by this author for sure!
B002JWD6AS|4.0|Would  give to my teenage granddaughter.  Although I am over 65 enjoyed the young love out look. And the twist and turns of the wolf pack mixed with their human thoughts.  Kept my attention.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I enjoyed this - watched it twice. Nice storytelling and good acting!  Didn't purchase this - free to watch on the OTHER movie streaming website.  Will buy it when the price comes down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very entertaining app, both my boyfriend and I enjoy it on our kindle. When the other is busy, this is a great app to pass the time.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Puzzles were great. Story line was interesting and the graphics were on point. Worth the purchase to complete the story.

B00AJRQLTI|5.0|My daughter and I loved the movie so we purchased the soundtrack.  All I ever hear coming from her mouth are her favorite songs.  When I listen to the soundtrack it reminds me of the excellent acting which more than made up for the less trained singing you would hear on Broadway.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Lauren Oliver's, Delirium drew me in immediately once I read the summary. A world where \\"love\\" is classified as a disease? I was very interested in seeing how she could make that seem realistic. And she did. The writing was beautifully crafted & her metaphors a unique voice. I fell in love with Lena's fight and definitely look forward to reading the rest of this series!
0805076476|5.0|You always hear that the book is better than the movie.  It proves to be true again with Fight Club.  I devoured this book in just a couple of days and couldn't put it down.  There were several instances where funny scenes in the movie were even more entertaining in the book.  If you love Fight Club, buy this book.
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|Movie is a classic to me and only Berserk surpasses this anime. I love this movie. The awesome ninjas, the story, the voice acting, the action, the supernatural, the pacing. The only problem this particular release has is that there are no extras outside of trailers for lesser anime shows or movies. I would like to have some extensive interviews or insights from the makers, producers, voice actors, artists, writers...somebody, anybody to just give us information about the characters, their inspirations or whatever..just something. This anime classic deserves that much work and effort put into it, hands down.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is good and they finally have the real format rather than the fake widescreen or the fullscreen version. This is the version to own and it is a bit crisper and cleaner as well but not anything truly to write home about. I'm just happy we got the right formatted version and the choice for either Japanese or English.<br /><br />Fantastic movie. You must buy it as it is a  movie I often watch a few times a year.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Tom Clancy Threat Vector<br />Not good Tom Clancy.  The new writers are way out in cyber space and not realistic.
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|The acting was good around even the woman who's name escapes me and I don't really care enough to look it up, was pretty good. But the problem with the story is that it expected me to care about these drug dealer's plight and being endangered. I wasn't. Not in the least. I stayed with the movie because I am huge fan of Benicio Del Toro and to a much lesser extent, John Travolta who in my biased opinion those two stole the movie and were the only true highlights of this rather weak &#34;drug&#34; movie.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro shines as the selfish, conniving main muscle for drug lord, Selma Hayek. He is a bit awkward but truly heartless and somebody that you can safely call a surviving rat in every sense of the word, A real creep of a guy that you really can't help enjoy Del Toro do what he does best. If he wasn't in this movie, I can't imagine myself finishing the movie. His scenes are the ones that contain the more graphic, bloody scenes.<br /><br />I honestly didn't care if these drug dealers got caught, swindled their way out of handcuffs, shot, strangled, stabbed or were blown up in a boat, car or restaurant. I wasn't emotionally involved and the movie did not provide anything new or informative where it could at least keep me interested on that level at least. There is very little action, very little drama, and yes the token black friend is the first to die...lol, and it is not even a horror movie!<br /><br />If you are into the drug culture perhaps this movie would be a good way to waste time but for me this movie bored me to the point where it took me two sittings to finish a movie...that doesn't happen often.Two early sex scenes that show completely nude male buttocks but the woman is somehow covered in the right areas...should have been enough of a warning to know that this movie was going to suck.<br /><br />It's a modestly budget low key movie,
B009U9S6FI|4.0|I read this in high school and it has impacted my whole life. No matter how hard life gets, someone has had it worse and come through with flying colors. If they can do it so can I. Stay possitive and choose to be happy.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I have seen most of season 2 on repeat TV, just not in order. Still to watch with no commercials.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Loved it! A really good Christmas CD by Rod Stewart. Great value. He performed some of my favorite Christmas songs.

B002LFAHBO|5.0|Love Actually has been a family fav in both my family and my husband's for several years now!  After the kids go to bed, we watch it and howl with laughter over some scenes and tear up over others. LOVE this movie EVERY time we watch it!
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|From ages 3-60, our family favorite Cinderella story. Male and female family members. Story, casting, etc - everything perfect. And appropriate for all ages. LOVE this movie!
B0091REZMW|3.0|For a free game it's good. Sucks when you run out out of diamonds and you can't really buy the things you need
B005OP7162|4.0|Who cares about plot manipulation?  This show is so much fun to watch.  Totally hooked. You adore the characters you love, and love to hate the baddies.  Simply delicious!
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Beautiful, funny, touching, exquisitely well done.  Amazing cast- Bill Murray and Frances McDormand especially.  I always love Wes Anderson's movies, Royal Tenenbaums particularly.  This is another fine example of his work- wonderful characters, impeccable sets.  It is as if each shot is a piece of art.  It is incredible to me.  Writing this is making me in the mood to watch it again.
B005SLS3VY|4.0|I liked the Lincoln Layer movie so I decided to read The Brass Verdict then The Reversal. Both were excellent so I'm looking forward to The Fifth Witness next.<br />Michael Connelly makes for an easy and enjoyable read - Good plots, interesting story lines but not too complicated.
B009D5VPTI|4.0|It's always refreshing to see a strong female character.  My 3 year old son loves this movie (even though parts a bit scary to him) and I appreciate him seeing a strong female character.  Watching it is a wonderful excuse to snuggle up with the family, but it's not my favorite movie- strange storyline- loud rambunctious scenes which seem to go on forever.  But it is beautiful to watch (especially the bears gathering salmon out of the river- wow!).  It's definitely worth a watch, but not my favorite.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|I bought this because work had taken me to see 2 of the movies and I wanted to see the series because a lot of people talk about how good it is.  Anyone who likes these movies doesn't know a good story.  The basic's for every movie is, do some crazy wizard stuff, end up the hospital, have an old wise wizard tell the audience what happened.  I'm sorry but if you need a recap at the end of the movie, why did you make me sit through the first 2 hours?
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|So, I wasn't sure why the ratings were low-ish for this movie while I was watching it because it was definitely well made and very entertaining.  However, afterward, I realized there were some blaring weaknesses in the overall storyline.  It interfered with my ability to enjoy mulling over it after the fact.  Otherwise, who cares?  It was fun to watch.  Loved watching Jeremy and Rachel together too.
B003G93ZCM|4.0|This is a well written book, easy to read and full of interesting details and inside information.<br />It is an excellent complement of other books to get the whole picture of the Apollo endeavour.<br />Cernan was probably the astronaut more concerned about grasping the incredible experience of walking in another World, something the public want to know, and was rarely adressed by the few men that accomplished that.

0307474259|5.0|Reading this book as Gary debunks nutrition \\"experts\\", obesity \\"experts\\", medical research \\"experts\\", exercise \\"experts\\" and the whole mishmash of government and public health \\"experts\\" with vested interests is like watching Christopher Hitchens debate a roomful of religious fundamentalists and the socialist elite without batting an eye or raising a sweat...<br /><br />Makes you more than a little frustrated learning that you denied yourself a lot of good things over the years and your reward for doing so was to put on more weight...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an easy and fun app. it took kinda long to download but it was worth it. and it doesn't have annoying ads.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I am not a sophisticated computer geek. I need all the help I can get and Google is my guru!!!  Don't know how they do it.

1481251880|4.0|I had just read a book simular to this book. This book wasn't as powerful to me as the other one. However, I did like it very much. People get emotionally involved everyday and bring these feelings as baggage into their relationships. Yes, I do believe this was still a romantic story. I enjoy these stories better when there is actually a story other than, I love you and you love me.<br /><br />Ms Hoover keep up the good work.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Had myself anxiously awaiting the next page. Typing this quickly so that I can get the next book downloaded and start my reading.

B00A9X9ORI|3.0|It's okay this movie; however it is rather dark when you consider the killing on kids.  Not something for just anyone some people would be put off with the plot.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a long time!  I couldnt put it down.  I really loved it!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple and pure, excellent puzzle game. Have never been asked to rate this game per the app like others have noted; rated it out of sheer appreciation.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|No matter how you approach this film, it is a collosal waste of time:  for the folks who dreamt it up, finaced it, produced it, cgi'd it, acted in it, promoted it, etc.  BREAK the CHAIN; find something - nearly anything - else to watch.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|The parting line in the movie is my favorite of all!  What a great story of someone who never lost hope.

0981951252|5.0|I have listened to this audio program over and over.  I think it's best if you relisten to the same CD over and over to grasp the concepts before going on to the next one in the series.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|The history one reads in daily newspapers is revealed and brought to life by tying the stories together in this intriguing interpretation of the nation's past. This collection gives perspective and meaning to our history that all should read.
B0017QDH3S|5.0|Great movie, action packed good story line and lessons to be learned, worth the money and time, no need to think twice
B003O86FMW|4.0|A nice follow-up to the first in the series. Looking forward to reading the third installment. Will the revolution succeed? Who will Katniss go to?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is very entertaining and it is very realistic. the graffics are good but could be more realistic with the sounds.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It contains a lot of information that I intend to use. I am thinking about buying a hard copy, because I would like to be able to look up footnotes easier, take notes, and flag something I want to go back to.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Seams to work good. I wish it had more original sounds but at least it has a lot of sounds to choose from.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Most scenes seem totally realistic however, sometimes you can see the zombies &#34;mask&#34;.  That sort of takes away from the sense of the scene being real.  Other than that, I love the suspence - you never know when another Walker attact will come.  Once I start to watch an episode, I am glued to my TV.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was so awesome!<br />Loved the style of writing<br />I Hope there will be a second book to this one<br />Ending totally surprised me
B003C1QIO6|5.0|I bought it because I goofed. I thought it was a different CD ! But, I am glad to say it was a happy mistake. I did buy the CD used, so there is some scratching that means I am gonna have to buy it NEW soon, but I really love the music in these songs ! They're engaging, even the sad ones (!?!?), and I like the mellow vibe to them. Even the more upbeat ones are great songs to slow dance to - if you catch my drift ;) - but I really do like this CD.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was indeed a great read.It touched on all your emotions and such a great twist at the end,that made you stop and think.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|I didn't like this movie as much as I thought I would. When held in comparison to other Tim Burton films this one fell a bit short in my opinion. The constant black and white felt a bit dreary after a while and although the characters were cute, I had trouble paying attention to this movie. My kids watched it with me and a certain part of it made them sad enough to cry. I thought it was creative and the animation was pretty good, but it just wasn't a movie I really look forward to watching again.
B007P06DJK|5.0|For 25 years the songs and rythyms have been playing in m head. Now, with a fresh CD, I get to cement the tunes once again in my psyche. Oh, joy. The DVD was an unexpected and powerful look at th epolitics of the day and is well worth watching. In the mean time, I'm going to Graceland.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I couldn't imagine watching this movie and not falling in love with it. The little mouse is so adorable and the movie has such good animation. Usually when I see the a story book come to life, I always like the book better, but I feel like they did such an excellent job of making this movie, that it really reflects the story accurately.<br /><br />My kids have watched this movie over and over again and never seem to tire of it. The version we have has the Gruffalo's child on it as well, which is also a great movie. I would recommend this to parents as a nice, clean movie for kids.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Even if you watch this show on PBS it's not the entire version...if you get the UK video version there is more to it..I think PBS chops it up in certain parts.  Wonderfully written and the actors are amazing and if you are into period costume design the clothes are amazing - love the 1920 clothing.  It's just amazing how life was back then for both aristocrates and their house/kitchen staff...truly two different worlds.  If you like history then this series won't disappoint you.

B0026IBX1Y|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read.  It helps one to not sweat the small stuff and value what life brings.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for something inspiring or for someone experiencing challenges in life.  It's certainly motivation to live your life as it is!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love horses and when I play this game it feels like I actually own a real  horse. I love to enter my horse in competitions and take care of her.  This is by far  the best horse game I have ever played.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|This book is a wonderful read. I choose this rating because I loved the main character and I loved the overall theme of the book. A minor criticism is I thought the ending was a little obvious. I would give this book a 7 out of 10.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes people are beautiful. Not in looks. Not in what they say. Just in what they are.\\"
B005RDF2RG|5.0|Clever script, great music, good moral message. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy bring these animated creatures to life. have watched this movie many times over the years, most recently because my sixteen year old son wanted to watch it with me , his mom&#60;3.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The graphics in this game are great. Also a good storyline. It is not as difficult as some games still fun.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I love the sarcasm and wit of this show!  Definitely, humorous and fun.  I wish they would reboot this show.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|First of all, gems are way too expensive and it's far too easy to accidentally spend them. Princess Celestia would cost about $75 if you were to fork out real money for gems to buy her! I don't recommend playing the game when you are tired because it's far too easy to waste gems: when you are tapping to collect coins, it is easy to accidentally tap a building and tap the button to skip the wait, and then you have three less gems and got your coins thirty seconds faster. I am only slightly bitter.<br /><br />The social thing does seem to work very well. I keep hearing about this button to visit random farms, but I've yet to find it. And even though I have about twenty friends on Gameloft who are playing MLP, only two show up on my in-game friends list. Several quests require you to visit friends, or receive hearts or treasure chests from friends, so the social part of the game needs to actually work, or there goes another few gems to skip those quests. I am not a fan of Gameloft's business model.<br /><br />Other than that, I really enjoy playing this. I enjoy the minigames, as repetitive as they are, and the game where everypony straps on wings and goes flying to collect bits (coins) and white rainclouds is really fun. I like rearranging my Ponyville as I build more and unlock more land. I like that you can tap on trees and bushes and haystacks to get a few extra coins, and searching for Derpy in her box is fun.<br /><br />I just wish the social aspects of the game actually worked and that it was possible to bypass spending lots of real money on gems to complete the game. I get that that's why the game is free and that Gameloft needs to make a profit, but when the target audience is young girls, it seems almost criminal. I can only imagine how many parents don't have in-app purchases disabled and get a nasty surprise when they open their credit card statement or phone bill...
B004J4WLPU|2.0|Lupton's skill in telling her story by a series of &#34;letters&#34; to her dead sister was well done, kept the suspense going. What I did not like was the long ending, which after wading through left me confused about the result.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|whoever hates this app has mental problems! you can talk to your friends, like pictures, and make images. And a lot more other things. So like I said whoever hates this obviously has mental problems.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow-what a story!  I loved these characters.  I laughed and I cried, but I will think of this book and these characters for days to come!  If this peaks your interest at all, I strongly suggest you invest in the eBook and read and enjoy!
B005BOHYW2|4.0|Victoria's story is devastating, her past haunts her and she longs to move forward but lacks the skills to know where to begin.  The story broke my heart, and I fell in love with the clever use of flowers to communicate and the characters, which were so compassionate and real. I only gave the book a 4 as I felt it rushes to an ending, that certainly made me glad I had read the book, but made me feel short changed at not getting a bit more detail when the rest of the book is so full of detail and life. I also loved the dictionary of flowers provided at the end - a great complement to the book itself.<br /><br />I will definitely be looking out for more by this very talented author.  A great read!
B005UDD1R6|4.0|Plays movies and videos well on kindle. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because i'm not 100% familiar with app yet.
1609611543|5.0|It has changed my life. I feel comfortable with the idea that I don't need wheat or grains to fulfill my nutrition requirements.  I am eating more veg & fruit.  I can do the alternatives in the future.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|It would only play video for 30 sec to 1 min then it would exit the video. I didn't have any problems like that with any other player for kindle.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Been awhile since I read book in 2 days..  really sucked me in<br />I only hope the 2nd one is as good
B0063IH60K|5.0|I give it five star because I enjoy playing solitaire. I like to see if I  can win more than one game. I get so lost that more than an hour has gone by. If you like card games then you would like this one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it is a great app, it tells excess info about your battery like reading, internet time and stuff, overall great app
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|It takes a lot to disappoint me when reading...in general, if I'm reading then I'm enjoying myself. That said, I enjoyed the story but I do not think it lived up to the hype I read all about in the reviews. Yes, I laughed at times and yes, I was very sad at times. However, did it change my life? No. The main character was a little on the unbelievable side to me with a vocabulary larger than mine and understanding literature in ways that I did not grasp until college...and she's supposed to be 16. I enjoyed the lighthearted point of view of cancer; it was refreshing to hear a \\"realistic\\" interpretation of the experience. Nevertheless, 3 stars for me it is. Not the greatest book ever, but definitely not the worst.
0071766588|5.0|I loved it... No comments just buy it. Its perfect to who is looking forward to have a goos result at toefl test.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|addictijg. slow moving and youll need actual money to get ahead quick. if u dont mind the development time, it's awesome
B009E3EY38|5.0|I sent this item as a gift and the person who received it complimented the packaging (I asked for it to be wrapped). Everything worked out as planned.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much you take care of your horse and its like your caring for your own real horse!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!
B00A31UXLW|5.0|My husband and I are avid freaders if Michael Connelly's books and we are thoroughly enjoying this one may there be many more to come
B003G4W49C|3.0|The book was great but I thought I was buying the &#34;Ender Quintet&#34;.  I was unhappy to find that I only purchased a single book that was a member of the quintet.
B003SNKBXW|3.0|The story was okay, and fun for someone familiar with classic serial adventure novels. Overall, this is quick beach reading for someone who likes Dumas.<br />The e-book itself, though, was filled with mistakes -- missing punctuation for entire paragraphs at a time (the only way you could tell a sentence ended was through capitalized letters), misspellings (&#34;rain&#34; always came up as &#34;ram&#34;, &#34;Dürer&#34; as &#34;Diirer&#34;, and so on), and references to pages in the books discussed (it is a book about books, so this is a frequent occurrence) are seen by the Kindle as references to pages within the e-book and show up as links rather than, say, &#34;page 32.&#34;  I blame terrible OCR and a lack of proofreading on the part of the publisher. Granted, it was only $1.99, but I can see why it was, and all other Perez-Reverte titles are over $10.
B00A6F9Y7O|4.0|Wandermude is an album of futuristic ambient themes from German \\"sound artist\\" Stephan Mathieu and the multi-talented David Sylvian.  Electronic musician Fennesz also contributes to one track.  The pieces are haunting and somewhat formless in terms of melodic content (more tones than melodies). Sylvian does not sing on the album.  The cover photo of the gloves from a space suit gives the listener a hint of what he or she is in for; hearing Wandermude gives the feeling of floating through space, but in a vaguely overwhelming and menacing scenario.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|To one degree or another, parts of my life have been all three women.  I wished there was a Holder to have given me reassurance/ guidance, when I was a young woman figuring out how to have a successful relationships.  If there had been a man like Holder, perhaps I may have been more successful.  What a great story. I read the book in two evenings.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Makes me feel sick every time I am about to win the game and yet I cannot stop playing...well done. A fine tuned and engrossing app that is worth every penny and more.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Top notch program. Loved being able to watch and re-weach on amazon instant video. I highly recommend this exciting program.
0823015033|3.0|this is a little advanced for me and not all that informative on different types of figurines. Need something alittle more.
B004OC07F8|5.0|I am still reading the book, but so far is keeping me very interested in the subject. I will be back.
6304698658|5.0|Family watches this every year at Christmas and like all the other favorites they were on VHS and just had to upgrade to dvd.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Could not put this down.  I wasn't sure if this was something I would like but well worth the purchase.
B004LE7PCM|4.0|I believe the primary motive for the almost-full rating was the exceedingly generous pricing for such a complete work. A fantastic series of mystery and detective novels, Sherlock Holmes is, in my view, most appealing to young readers with a keen perception.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is simply amazing!!! I read it twice back to back and I absolutely can not wait for the next book. I love the whole bad boy good girl theme even though Abby isn't quite as innocent as she portrays to be. She has a little wild side to her. I love it love it love it. If your are looking for a love story roller coaster this is your book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this app. Lots to do and not too easy or too hard. It keeps you very interested and has plenty of leveling up. You have to care for your horse so you can look forward to playing daily. And you can level up pretty fast and win points and such to buy another horse or even tack for your horse or clothes for your little person. Pretty exciting game.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Wasn't available in my country for a couple of months later, so even with waiting for it to arrive was faster than I could buy it in Australia.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great graphics worth every penny and exciting. Your definitely gonna want to check this game out. You won't want to miss out. Didn't put it down until I finished playing it.
0525953728|5.0|First, let me say that I enjoy biographies, but I'm not the type to normally read action-adventure macho type of books. But I was quite curious about this book due to all the publicity it received. I wasn't sure how much it would add to the documentary I'd already seen about the killing of Bin Laden. I found it to be a fascinating account of the life of an elite Navy Seal in general and the Bin Laden mission in particular, and I really could not put it down. I read it every night until I'd finished it. Interesting subject and good ghostwriter too!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A young-love story with a dramatic twist.  Difficult to put the book down because you want to find out what will happen next.  Suspenseful in that you have this feeling that something dramatic is going to happen that will affect the main characters relationship. Has a very deep and upsetting twist that is almost too much (for me) in a fiction novel but ends on as much of a happy note as it can and a very good read.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Runs fine, even when overclocked.<br /><br />Keeps up in all the latest games, and anything else you would need from something this powerfull.
B005JABSB6|5.0|I got these glasses for my Sharp 70&#34; 3D and they work wonderfully.  Although they indicate to charge them from the USB hub on the tv, I found it much easier to spend $5 at the local electronics store for a regular plug to usb adapter.  This way I can charge multiple pairs at once.
1596432594|5.0|My 15 year old science geek son loved this book.  I'm getting him to read more books by getting him excited with graphic novels about science.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|Big let down from season one. This year's show is much too over the top with the writers throwing in every horror cliche and then even more cliches. Back to the drawing board for season 3.
B000065K6N|2.0|I thought that I was purchasing a movie with English spoken. It turns out that that Chinese and Japanese are the spoken languages with English subtitles. Great movie nonetheless. Seller misrepresented this item.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love the game, but it is very difficult to accumulate diamonds which are needed for just about everything  in the game!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|This book is a worthy sequel in the series and infinitely better than some of the earlier ones. I will be watching out for the next one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book and the series it just so touching and amazing and you feel like you're in the book
B000LTAY1U|5.0|great little watch traditional military.....  good night glow, fits well.... I really like this watch  easy to read the face and a wonderful price!
B005LAIIA8|5.0|i bought this for my husband and he loves it! the box had a little dent but nothing major. im so glad i bought this movie :)
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart is great.  The songs are outstanding and the product came when promised. The package was in excellent shape.
030759565X|5.0|I love the Smitten Kitchen blog, so I was really excited to get Deb's book as a Christmas gift. It doesn't disappoint. I've already tried several recipes - all fantastic - and, as others have said, actually enjoy just reading the book. Deb's writing is self-deprecating and conversational and the photos are beautiful.<br /><br />As someone who's pretty new to the kitchen, I'll admit I was a bit intimidated when I first stumbled across the Smitten Kitchen website. But Deb puts so much time into her recipes, and breaks them down so clearly, that I find myself pulling off things I never would've tried before. It's the perfect mix of recipes that feel aspiration or exciting and new, but still attainable enough that I'm not afraid I'll just end up calling for takeout.<br /><br />I also love that she focuses on whole foods and produce, but not in a \\"eat-a-pile-of-kale-for-dinner\\" sort of ridiculous way. She uses cream when you need cream. And her recipes don't call for crazy speciality salts or $50 cooking oils. It's the kind of food I want to feed my friends.<br /><br />Really...just buy it! I can't say enough good things.
B0000A02U2|5.0|I love this movie.  I've seen it before.  I will show my grandsons when they are age appropiate.  that's it.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book had me completely involved by page 25. It isn't very original, but was still captivating and I loved the sequel even more, which never happens to me.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down.<br />Every one should get it. Highly recommended<br />Enjoy the book. It's a delight and fun for the whole family to read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never read a book that touched me on such an emotional level in so many ways. Well written, great story! I laughed, cried and actually found myself angry at some points. I was hesitant to read this because I prefer a story with characters who are older, closer to my own age HOWEVER, I could not put this book down and read it all in one day. I can't say enough good things! Not one time was I disappointed!!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I do not want to spoil anything with this movie but will say,  I like the effects quite a bit.  There are some parts of the story that I really got into but there are other parts that I think they missed the boat completely on, in terms of connecting to the original movie.  Overall I enjoyed the movie and look forward to then next movie.
B004XANKVO|4.0|Anyone who purchase this backpack will love it. It's versatile durable and water proof. Very comfortable on the shoulders and back.
B0063IH60K|4.0|As always, as pleasure to play. There is a bit of time each day to get a game in, always.
B00914JWSW|3.0|Although some of the songs are magical, the overall package left you wanting to hear her classics.  Of course, most fans already have those albums.  I wouldn't recommend this CD as your first Barbra selection.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Childs can always be counted on for a good read, never ending action and sometimes a twist to surprise you.  This book was no exception.  Looking forward to the next episode of Agent Pendergast.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The relationships established in seasons 1 and 2 continue to grow and at times amaze me in surprising ways.  I didn't notice a single change of actors in any major role.  This continuity makes the story that much more enjoyable.  My only regret is that, unlike the first two seasons, I'm now having to watch it piecemeal as are most fans who tune in each week for the initial episode broadcasts.  The dvd season era has spoiled me.  However, this is one show that I didn't want to wait for, and I've not been disappointed at all!  Waiting a week for each episode only increases the anticipation!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book introduced a new character who is every bit as complex and interesting a personality as any of the previous characters introduced by David Baldacci.  Loved everything about this book.  Hope John Puller, Jr. stays around for several more books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have tried for months to find a book that lived up to Sea of Tranquility and this was the first one that I loved as much and maybe a little more.  Great writing, realistic connection and an overall great story that kept you guessing to the end.  This was my first Colleen Hoover book but not my last.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book, I can't put it into words read it.like e it. Live it. Ono the best books ever .
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|I was surprised at how well this was actually done. Its an unconventional love story with some good acting. Some good actors too. I really liked the ending....
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I live in Arizona in the winter and am able to keep up with what is happening at our home in Canada.  I can also check weather in other areas where I have friends and family.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Have been playing this game for awhile, on my phone and my Kindle Fire,  and enjoy it. Don't mind buying diamonds on occasion.
B008M721MS|4.0|I enjoy Skype so much.  It is awesome to be able to talk to people face to face and see our Grand Kids when we are not where they are.  I have an excellent connection and some of my friends are in the country where they don't have as good a connection but you can still talk without video.  I haven't used the phone calls yet but I haven't had to.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was well written, keeping my interest and keeping me in suspense until the very end. The unnerving  part is that I think our society is having to deal with more people like Jacob. It seemed all too real.
B0039SFKSW|4.0|A nice and coulorful albumsleeve. A very good mix and sound on this album. Good songs, and its great that Steve Howe are back and together with Geoff Downes in Asia. One ofte the reasons I like Asia is the keyboard playing from Geoff Downes. This is one ofte the best album form this band.  Worth the money.
1595141979|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!! This 3rd installment was amazing :D What I wanted from this story was more action, more romance, more secrets and boy did I get it. I know the book was 400+ pages but I wanted it to keep going. I really enjoyed the dark side of Rose and Lissa in this book. The author gives us just a little peak of evil that Lissa and Rose go through. You also get to find out more of the Moroi powers.<br /><br />Like I said this book had all the fighting action between the Guardians and Strigoi (Does scenes where my favorite ;D). More killing and more deaths. All the characters in this book were flawless. I really enjoyed getting to know them more. Mason shows up more in this book in ways that only Rose can see. Adrian is one character that is said to be a royal flirt, which at first I thought was true, but then you get to know what his intuitions are and so does Rose. I'm thinking that we are still going to keep reading about Adrian.<br /><br />And finally of course you read more and more about Rose and Dimitri. I just love how the author makes their relationship so hard and unique that leaves you wanting more of them. They finally show and share how much they love each other in this book and the ending just breaks your heart. Such a great and intense ending and that just makes it worth it.
B005G26NJE|5.0|This music makes me feel cool when I'm ready to chill.  Such a talented artist.  Buy it, listen, you can just feel talent.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Wars are not pleasant topics at the best of times. When I realized that the theme was the Second World War, I struggled to get into the book. As I got to know the characters and saw their lives interlinking so well, I found that I could not put the book down. This book was written with great sensitivity and understanding. A very impressive epic. Well done.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I was so happy to receive this CD! I received it in less than a week and have been listening to it ever since. Nice sound quality.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I shopped around for a camera case for my Nikon D5100 and assorted lenes. I wanted a quality bag but I didn't want to spend $150+ for some of the bags I found. I fouind this bag and its measurments were comparable to bags costing 4X the amount. The bag arrived very quickly and I am very inpressed at its size and quality. It holds my camera, four lenses,a dozen filters and assorted accessories. I highly recommend this case!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show ever...and this is coming from someone who watches A LOT of TV shows! I am totally hooked on this one and can't wait for new episodes!!!
B00A4AI19I|5.0|Most well known conductors have recorded complete cycles of Brahms symphonies, yet overall this one has a strong claim to be among the very best, for its strength, great conducting and superb orchestral playing, very idiomatic of Brahms. I particularly like the 4th. The overtures are very valuable make-weights. Last but not least, the German Requiem, justly famous, crowns a great cycle. The recording sounds very realistic. There is no more satisfying cycle at any price. Highly recommended.
1475143389|5.0|Recently returned to a fitness training after a long layoff, over 12 years.  Read the book first, then developed a workout plan based on my goals. Michael Matthews dispelled a number of myths to fitness that I had.  The book is a quick read and the information provided is simple and straightforward.  I now have the confidence in my fitness plan and know the results are forthcoming. Bigger Leaner Stronger is a highly recommended &#34;must read&#34; especially for those like me who are embarking on  fitness training after a long layoff or someone new to fitness.....you'll start off on the right foot and not waste alot of time and effort.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album is incredible. Admittedly, I became introduced to Macklemore through Thrift Shop, but I'm just absolutely blown away by the quality of the songs. All of them are beautiful. Not something most people would say about a hip-hop album, but there's no better way to describe it. You will not regret buying this album.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I very much so enjoy playing spider solitaire to make time pass a little quicker. This app isn't quite as good as the app I used to have on my old Android phone, but is the closest equivalent thus far found on my kindle.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Buyer Beware! These rip off programs are layered within each other, leading innocent children to punch a button and suddenly purchase a season or another level of stupid garbage. I've now set my Kindle so it can't happen but it's a bit costly way to learn about these scams.
0307730697|5.0|This the best recount of a Navy Seal's life I have read. The personal stories were incredible. Some folks the Seals are all wonderful people before they get to the training, this shows they are not. Great insight into Adam Brown's demons and how he let his faith, family and dedication to his job and country lead him through. I thank God for young men and women that put duty to God and Country above all else.
B0001US8EO|5.0|I have had this one for a long time and loved it  Thought it would be a good gift ...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|get this app it is spoon cool you get to take care of your own horse and it is awesome!!! get this app!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This has always been my absolute favorite book. I will always love this book. I'm so glad I found it and can read it whenever I want.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This Blu-ray/DVD combo is a well enhanced version of the original VHS. I would recommend if you are considering it to upgrade to this version!
B000FBJAOG|5.0|This is a must have for anyone wanting to know how to survive when the zombies attack. I highly recommend this product.
B000001FKY|5.0|By now I'm sure that everybody has heard Def Leppard's 1987 record \\"Hysteria.\\" If you have not, you must have been living under a rock for the last twenty years or so. This album causes a lot of love/hate in the Leppard camp. You either really like the album (like myslef and a million others), or you look at it like Leppard sold out just to keep the hits coming. Either way this album is one of the best of the genre and you can't go wrong buying this baby.<br /><br />After three years and the strong possibility that their days of being rock stars were over, due to the untimely accident of drummer Rick Allen, Def Leppard came back stronger than ever with one of the greatest rock records ever made. The sound is different than \\"Pyromania\\" and their earlier efforts, but not worse. Def Lep basically took Michael Jackson's approach and made a hard rock album in which every song could have been released as a single or video. I'm a MONSTER fan of '80s cheese and excess, so I may not be the most objectionable reviewer of this album, but I just can't see any fans of melodic rock not really enjoying the album. Every song is strong and easily could have been a single, but the production of this album and its harmonies really kick you in the tail and make it even more enjoyable.<br /><br />Buy this album right now if you don't already have this. I can't imagine any fan of '80s hard rock not having this baby, but hey, it's more than possible.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I'll keep it short, I'm fairly picky about what I read it has to have a certain flow and had I had the time to finish it in a day or two I would have, overall great read. The only downside I can think of is waiting for the next book, this is probably #2 on my list right behind The Way of Kings; cannot wait!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Rented The Hunger Games Movie for my family to watch and we were all happy with the movie.  My wife was a little disappointed that is wasn't more like the book and I was a little lost in some parts because I hadn't read the book but it was still a good movie for family night.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I started with One Shot and enjoyed it a lot so I thought I would start here.<br />Story was ok, I prefer the 3rd person perspective though.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|I love heavy metal, power metal and in general I love metal, the first two bands I heard in power metal were Stratovarius and Helloween, and for me they are the gods of Power Metal Worlwide, I think Helloween have two discs that I dislike but Stratovarius is band that existed (for me) between 1984-2005 after that Stratovarius is a crap... but that not happened to Helloween, I highly recomend all the albums they have and this one is another masterpiece, Why buy at amazon.com? Free Shipping, dipipak premium edition with two bonus tracks and the new Autorip is simply amazing, if you preorder a disc at midnight of the release day you can download it to enjoy it and after a few days you will receive the limited edition... The songs are simply amazing, and to tell you the truth the only two discs that I would not buy ever are Chameleon and 25th Unarmed discs that are a piece of crap... HELLOWEEN POWER METAL GODS FOREVER!!!!
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|neil and the horse rock like the old days, songs up to 27 minutes long!! happy to hear neil like this again.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is awesome. But the time needs to be longer .I hope that everyone likes this game.I got addicted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In my opinion I thought this game was awesome it's creative and fun and I hope u like it as much as I do!
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|Like I said, it is one of my fav soundtracks. My favorite part is the riff off scene. Only wish that titanium was in there, along with a few other songs
B000WGWQG8|5.0|We have only watched the first disc but it was captivating! It seems historically believable although there is always the dramatic license factor. We are not crazy about the actors but the content more than makes up for this.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I like the sound, battery charges really quick, can use this anywhere in the house, mic works perfectly, voice changer is cool, but I wouldn't just buy this for that hardly ever change my voice,<br /><br />I would recommend
B005HSL626|4.0|This app is a odd game but very fun to play. The basics of playing this game is to use your finger and slide ot across the screen to slice fruit that is thrown up. It is a basic game and very easy to play and there are unlockable prizes that can be used in the game. I recommned this game to basically anyone who likes tap games.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|It is the very best thing that has ever been purchased in the history of purchasing as we know it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|well it takes a while to load but it is really fun now maybe I am just turning 13 I swash born today at 2:30 am
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|This books plot was spellbinding and  like all Jack Reacher stories It was totally impossible to put down till the last page.
B0054YIQLW|1.0|i am very dissapointed this dvd will not play on uk players  when ibought this dvd it didnot mention it was for U.S.A. dvd players  .when i ask you for help i am told it will cost me £28 which i find unbelivable.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I am absolutely obsessed with this game. I'm a girl brony and this game has everything I'm looking for. I don't know how to explain it but it's just...<br /> Amazing. It sometimes has a bit of problems, like it won't start, but it's worth it. I will give you all a great piece of advice: NEVER EVER spent your gems. You need to save up as much as you can to buy ponies. Only spent them if it is REQUIRED. This game is really fun until you get to the point where you need to spend real money. It would take years to complete this game without spending real money. That is why, sadly, I am deleting this app. I love it SO MUCH but I know I'm gonna end up wasting hundreds of dollars or finish it in a couple of years. I've worked so hard on this game but I'm not falling for that trick. I really recommend getting this app even you'll have to delete it eventually.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is one of Michael Connelly's best Bosch stories.  He gets a 20-year-old murder case to solve, and painstakingly follows every step of his detective experience to track down the guilty parties.  Thoroughly enjoyable.

B000T433CO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I skipped it while it was in theaters because Jack Black can just be too much sometimes and he made it seem as if the movie might be slapstick and goofy and he just didn't &#34;go&#34; with the rest of the cast -- or so I thought. He was actually pretty terrific! Nice, real, soft. And for me, Jude Law always seems a bit arrogant in non-action roles, but he surprised me as well. I watched it as a rental and then immediately bought a copy for me and my friend.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|The quality was great.  LOVE the HD viewing!  Supernatural always pleases! It was all around a good show/season to watch.f
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|A good premise somewhat brought down by average writing and a &#34;yo, dude&#34; flavor. I did enjoy the movie, which prompted me to buy the book. It was nice to get some details in writing, but I did get impatient sometimes with all these teens and their angst. However, I was sucked in enough to continue to purchase the books because now I need to know what happens! I really like Bernie Kosar!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so exciting, suspenseful, tragic, and hard to stop watching.  It leaves you wanting more and disappointed when it is ove.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|This is a good account of Eben's experience but very hard to really feel any emotion. He writes as a doctor using terms and many medical explanations. So much so that it takes away from his experence. I think this is written more as a medical and scientific proof that Heaven is a real place. Not an easy read for those of us not versed in medical terms.

B009POCG2C|5.0|I grew up with baseball. Not watching the games on TV, but watching my father play and manage in pro ball for many years as I was growing up. Sitting in the stands with my grandparents, my mother, and/or my sister and brother are memories I will cherish forever.<br />This movie shows a very true-to-life idea of the conflict between the reality of the real people of baseball and the modern version of the &#34;successful&#34; business which too many people think is the way things should be run.<br />There is no substitute for 'the man on the ground' who knows the sights and sounds and smells of baseball. Baseball has become a game of numbers and statistics, but there is no better feeling than being in the park, watching the American Pasttime with someone you love and who loves the game as much as you.<br />Gus has lost sight of that and has to be re-introduced to the idea by his long-estranged daughter, Mickey.<br />A sad and beautiful commentary on what we as parents can miss if we don't use our hearts as well as our heads.

B0065GC0BA|5.0|I had to wait several days after finishing this book, to be able to sit down and write my thoughts about it, and to think clearly to properly review this wonderful, wonderful story.  Such a powerful and extraordinarily beautiful story.  And next to the  epic love story of Alexander and Tatiana in The Bronze Horseman trilogy, it is the most profound and heart wrenching love story I have ever read.  JoJo Moyes is a brave lady to tackle a subject such as this, but she did it with such grace and compassion and joy.<br />At first, I didn't think I could write about this story,  It was excruciatingly painful to read the last chapter and last few pages and I was so angry with Will.  Yet the end was beautiful and full of love at the same time.  After a few days, I realized it had to end this way and JoJo Moyes did an extraordinary justice to the story.  Oh my.  It had to be hard for her, as well.  In the end, this story will make you think, will make you appreciate and love life even more, and will inspire you to be a better and more compassionate  person.  It's not all about you.<br />Read this..................you won't forget it.  And then read her first book, The Last Letter from your Lover.  It too, is a wonderful read.  She knows how to write a love story and she knows how it will touch you.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Couldn't stop once I started. Well written, intense and compelling action. More nuance than the movie version of the first book, which I didn't read, but still fast paced and entertaining. Collins knows her way around a plot twist or two, and she had lots of fun messing with the whole notion of a dystopian future that somehow also feels like it is taking place in the past.<br />I am going straight on to the next one.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|Just got the Kindle Fire HD 7 and was looking for a good mp4 player for ripped movies that I make from my current DVD library. The program works great for movies but the coolest part is being able to download and view later youtube while still having the same functionality that got when logging into youtube normally. I was looking to see if there was a paid version cause the writers of this program deserve some funds to keep it going. Very cool.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book has you hooked as soon as you read a few pages. I had only downloaded the sample but I had to buy it to know what happened. The characters are so real and easy to follow. One of the best books I've read in a while. Can't wait for the movie.
0307719774|5.0|This is a great product!  First, the book is very well made. The bindings are tight, and the covers are sturdy.  It is pleasing to look at.  The gilded pages are a nice touch.<br /><br />Each day of the year asks a question, and then there are five spaces, one for each of five years.<br /><br />What a great motivator to keep a journal.<br /><br />I gave several away as gifts, and all the recipients were delighted.<br /><br />Great idea!<br /><br />In service,<br /><br />Rich
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I absolutely love the series since I watched it and had to own them on Blu-Ray. I delayed a bit. When I found out that they came out with this ultimate box set (which I usually am not a fan of novelty sets) I had to purchase it. Great quality box. The extras were fun and well worth it when I purchased it on Amazon.com well below the cost of the regular Blu Ray set. Thanks Amazon!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is her best cd so far.  Her voice is at the top.  All the songs were perfect for her voice.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved that movie. The cast of actors cannot be beaten, and the actors' performance is uniformly outstanding. On the surface, it may seem like a movie about old people, but it's much, much more than that. It's about the new beginnings, and hope, and being true to yourself and not giving up in big and small ways, and about it never being too late to do something you think is right. I realize this may sound corny but the movie is far from it. It's funny and kind and has a happy ending that is just the right side of the fairy tale. The best two hours of entertainment I have had in months.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|Have two Firewire 800 external hard drives connected in series and both work have been working as expected.  No problems so far.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book was good on so many levels. The way the writer pieced together every part of the book from seconds, to minutes, to hours, and to days made the story that much easier to follow along. I loved how Dean and Sky`s relationship between each other other was relatable. I loved this story of a hopeless  girl and boy in which they came together to solve a long mystery.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really enjoyed World War Z. It is very engaging, and much more than that. I think its genius lies in its structure, it is amazing how the story is unfolded through different people's point-of-views. Although it is about zombies, it is so realistic and detailed as a non-fiction could be.<br />I can recommend this book to everybody who likes zombie stories or just would like to read something completely different.<br />I am sorry to hear that Brad Pitt's movie has almost nothing to do with the book.
B00ACKU1NY|5.0|this is great for me to keep up with my French and being able to access different channels to diversify my listening.
B000002LEU|5.0|Joy Division helped define a new era of music in the late 70's/early 80's before the death of lead singer Ian Curtis.  Substance is a compilation of their previous works under the name &#34;Warsaw&#34; and the classic hits of Joy Division.  It's a perfect blend of rawness and an ambient dark side of the new wave movement.<br />If you have never been exposed to Joy Division, this is a great place to start.  They were well beyond their years and they layed the foundation for future great works under the New Order name.
0684803356|5.0|The presentation of this book is enjoyable own excellent work, which can be read nimbly and with some ease and this time.
B000002LCK|5.0|Substance by New Order is a masterpiece double album of work that picks up where Joy Division left off.  It helped define the club scene playlists of the 80's and contains some of the most recognized club dance tracks of that era.  There is literally not a bad track on the entire double set.  This is a must have for anyone who likes New Order, or anyone wants to explore liking them.  One listen and you'll be hooked!  There are so many intricate sounds and masterful synthesized blends throughout this work that you will be blown away when listening to it on a hi-end sound system.
B0063GORYU|4.0|a good way to pass the time and challenge me too!! I always enjoy playing and love that I can replay a poorly played hand.
034580404X|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this trilogy since I expected a better quality of story telling  because these books were so talked about in the media. The story was ok but after all the excessive detailed porn, pages and pages of it, I got rather bored and started skiping those pages to move the story along. Enough already with the porn I got the message that the characters are sexually attracted to each other and did not need to keep hearing it over and over again. She could have used the pages to get deeper into the characters and perhaps I would have been more attached to the individuals she was trying to write about. The characters were very one dimensional and I just didn't like either one of them because they both seemed rather shallow.<br />This is one time were I think the movies will be better than the books because they will not put all that descriptive porn into the movie but tell the real story about these two characters.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book! I've read it twice and each time enthrawled with Christian!  Can't wait for book two and the movie!!!
B0076DEJMO|3.0|I haven't encountered worse copy editing in a Kindle book. I was constantly distracted from an otherwise enjoyable story by typos.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|nice graphics, it could've lasted longer. But all in all great game. As with a lot of these games, it's common knowledge that the free version isnt the entire game. Just enough to let you see if it's  a game worth continuing. But for the 2.99, it needs to be longer. And I don't  really want to pay any more than that.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Left wanting more. The complexity of manipulation was an interesting read,but I wanted a bit more. Didn't reach level of hype and reviews.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|This is one of the best Helloween albums! Every song is a great track, no filler tracks.  I have listened to these guys since 1986 and they have only gotten better with time.  There are not many bands you can say that about.  Do yourself a favor and listen!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Came the way I expected it, good condition, sealed, exactly as it was described. I am enjoying it to the fullest

B003ZFVI8U|5.0|Robot Hive/Exodus is the seventh full-length studio album by rock band Clutch. It was released in 2005 and contains 14 tracks (15 on certain editions), including two Blues covers. A reissue of the album was released on September 28th 2010 with the original 14 tracks, new packaging and a DVD of their performance at the Sounds of the Underground festival in July 2005.<br /><br />Band Personnel<br /><br />Neil Fallon...Vocals, Guitar, Percussion<br />Tim Sult...Guitar<br />Jean Paul Gaster...Drums, Percussion<br />Dan Maines...Bass<br />Mick Schauer...Hammond Organ, Hohner Clavinet, Wurlitzer Electric Piano<br /><br />This is typical Clutch at their finest but a bit more experimental than usual with much diversity throughout the album. Memorable songs, instant classics.<br /><br />I read...<br /><br />\\"The vocals also seem very diverse with Neal Fallon applying wide range of patterns that include fast funky jamming (\\"Naver Be Moved\\"), fast mechanical delivery (\\"Burning Beard\\"), intense screaming (\\"10001110101\\"), classic blues singing (\\"Gravel Road\\"), and even some Indian chants (\\"10,000 Witnesses\\"). He often refrains from his lower-register bark, in favor of a more mid-range sounding making his vocals more accessible to an average listener. As for the lyrics, Fallon has an uncanny skill of combining poetic visions (\\"Land of Pleasant Living\\") with surreal cultural commentary (\\"Pulasky Skyway\\"). His work is mostly abstract frequently relying on potent metaphors (\\"Mice and Gods\\").\\"<br /><br />The man is \\"The God of Frontmen\\" bar none while Jean Paul Gaster is also tripping along at his usual pace with pitch perfect drumming. Tim Sult's amazing riffage and complex solos are exceptional on this CD. Dan Maines lays down some honkin' bass lines, deep and powerful.<br /><br />\\"The addition of a new member to the band for the latest opus Robot Hive/Exodus comes in the ever dubious keyboard department. No such worries for Mike Schauer however, who more than proves his worth within opener The Incomparable Mr Flannery with his Hammond skill and trickery contributing perfectly to what is a fuller, funkier and all together even better Clutch.\\"<br /><br />\\"Robot Hive / Exodus not only builds on the success of Blast Tyrant, [[ASIN:B004P05O98 Blast Tyrant]] it tops every album Clutch has released before, combining everything they've done in the past into one cohesive sound that is as fresh as it is comfortably familiar.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Oh, how James Bond has changed over the years from the suave and debonair Sean Connery to the unflappability of Roger Moore to the poignant subtlety of Pierce Brosnan to the quantum of solace exhibited by my very favorite of the Bond actors--Daniel Craig. His Bond is absolutely fearless--and we find out why in \\"Skyfall,\\" the latest in the wildly successful Bond series of hit movies!<br /><br />Skyfall--such an intriguing title, but what does it mean? Little Chicken shrieking about a falling sky but done metaphorically, of course? That's a good assumption, but not it. When the word, Skyfall, does appear on screen, it comes as a revelation. Skyfall, I actually said aloud. Skyfall. Of course.<br /><br />But I get ahead of myself. The opening scene defies the meaning of the word danger in movie history. How is it possible for two men to fight and jump and fall in such a location as the rooftops of the cars in a speeding train? But they do, only to see Bond fall into the opening movie credits and what I consider the best of the Bond title songs, which is co-created and sung by Adelle.<br /><br />The villain this time is Javier Bardem, an actor so talented that he can equally be convincing as horrific villains and an impossibly romantic lead (\\"Pray, Eat, Love\\"). He's a British agent, too, or was until the huge charge of power becomes a siren he cannot resist. More potent than power is vengeance and rightly so, in this case. He becomes corrupt and powerful and very destructive and vengeful, one of the most ominously dangerous of England's enemies in the Bond series.<br /><br />The show-down between Bond and Bardem has many flaws, but that's OK, it's a movie and those flaws can be ignored and forgiven. However, the big news is that three new actors are introduced into the story line, each taking the place of important character fixtures. The viewer will say, Oh my, with each new revelation and yet be pleased at how each is introduced. Yeah, I'm being vague--don't want to give any spoilers.<br /><br />So, that's my review. I'm skipping plot details because others before me beautifully presented those. My point is to highlight the changes and emphasize Daniel Craig as THE new Bond (yes, this is his third film as Bond, but this film establishes Craig as enduring and absolute).ve any spoilers.<br /><br />So, that's my review.

B009PJ1Q82|5.0|European in mood but American in setting, this frank examination on personal struggles manages to transcend the confines of a gay themed movie and become a universal meditation about love and loss. In this, it is a bold film - it supposes that sexual identity is only a detail amongst many when it comes to the issues of how we relate, to ourselves and others. At times, it is painfully honest portrayal of carnally expressed despair.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|True to Trey Parker/Matt Stone form, this movie tweaks the sensibilities even further by rolling out non-stop action sequences with marionettes.  Unbelievably engaging, but I have to say that the puppet sex scene made me squirm with discomfort, especially since I picked up the unrated version.  Sometimes, these boys get carried away.<br /><br />Pretty funny and oddly satisfying watching iconiclastic, ego-bloated, politically outspoken, inexplicably much celebrated actors in marionette form take a brutal beating in the climactic scenes of the film, set in a posh representation of Kim Jong-Il's palace.  I'm sure the leader never looked so good, albeit LONELY...

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm helplessly addicted.  Intense performances from a very talented troupe of actors carry this series into a realm where others have attempted to establish a foothold and failed.  Based on the graphic comic books, the story deviates just enough to keep the comic book follower guessing and coming back for more, week after week.

0812993357|4.0|I enjoyed this book, there was a great deal of absorbing information about the evolution of fashion, from an American perspective. Grace Coddington is an interesting woman, and certainly a member of the \\"aristocracy\\" of high fashion, along with Anna Wintour, Diana Vreeland, and so very many others.<br /><br />Seeing the fashion world from the perspective of such an insider is quite fascinating. The writing style is a bit peculiar, Grace seems to have just jotted down random memories, and a great deal of free-association is involved with the authorship of this book. The pen and ink drawings are cute and add personality to the book. I enjoy fashion and this book was an easy read, possessing many fascinating and appetizing tid-bits from that world.
1615470158|5.0|If you are looking for a top notch Powerpivot / DAX learning guide, look no further than Rob Collies new book \\"DAX Formulas for PowerPivot.\\"  I've been following Rob on his blog for over two years now and did not hesitate to buy this book.  It's extremely well written, clear, concise and flows logically down your DAX adventure. Rob is a bit cheeky in his writing, but that's what I like about him.  I chuckle a bit every time I read his book.  Rob's main focus is trying to get the reader to think like \\"DAX.\\"  It's a bit daunting at first, but it seems to all come together at once.  (Remember learning array formulas....that was spooky at first, but indispensible later on in the Excel development path).  On a side note, when I mention Powerpivot to other Excel pro's, their typical response is \\"I thought it was just a bigger pivot table that holds more records.?\\"  When I show them Rob's book, they are shocked and amazed at the true awesomeness that is Powerpivot.  Rumor has it that Rob may be writing a second book.....guess who will be first in line!!

B00A4AHZZO|5.0|Mozart played by a full symphony orchestra has fallen out of fashion.<br />The last two conductors to give us Big Orchestra Mozart were Bernstein and Karajan, and both have been gone for over 20 years (hard to believe).<br />In the mono era, Beecham, Walter, Toscanini and Furtwangler had no qualms about playing Haydn or Mozart with a full complement of strings.<br /><br />By the 1960s, chamber orchestras were the fashion, and big orchestra Mozart became suspect.<br />Neville Marriner was the new darling of the critics. His Mozart performances were tasteful and stylish.<br />[Period instrument Mozart didn't get really popular until Christopher Hogwood in the '70s].<br /><br />Nowadays when a symphony orchestra plays Mozart, it is with greatly reduced numbers: Most of the musicians are taking a cigarette break.<br /><br />A full symphony orchestra numbers 90-100 players, but that reflects the late Nineteenth Century need for augmented wind and brass.<br />Big orchestra Mozart requires about 60-70 players.<br />Chamber Orchestras average 30 players; period instrument orchestras 20 (or fewer).<br /><br />In my opinion, Haydn and Mozart benefit from the sound of a modern orchestra with full complement of strings.<br />Anyway, the purpose of this review is to distinguish Klemperer from the other practitioners of Big Orchestra Mozart.<br /><br />The danger with Big Orchestra Mozart is that the large number of strings can overpower and drown out the woodwinds and brass (Karajan was the worst offender).<br />A skilled recording engineer can compensate, but there are also things the conducter can do.<br /><br />When I was a teenager, the conductors l listened to on my new stereo were Bernstein, Karajan and Ormandy.<br />I was new to classical music, but I figured out that a symphony orchestra consisted of two major string groups: Violins on the left; Lower Strings on the right.<br /><br />A few years later, I bought my first Klemperer LP because it had a pretty cover.<br />I was surprised to find out that a symphony orchestra actually had five string groups:<br />Klemperer's strings were seated in an arc: First Violins, Basses, Cellos, Violas, Second Violins.<br /><br />The blended 20th Century string sound has become almost universal, but Klemperer's antiphonal string sound is the orchestra that Mozart was familiar with.<br />You could hear a lot of unexpected detail - especially with headphones.<br />Not just highs on the left and lows on the right.<br />Lots of contrapuntal dialogue among the five groups. A revelation.<br /><br />I was surprised that no one else had thought of it.<br />Some time later, I discovered that this was, in fact, the accepted seating arrangement for 200 years.<br />Mozart took it as a given when composing his symphonies.<br /><br />Leopold Stokowski is credited with devising the modern seating plan with massed violins on the left.<br />Stokowski liked the richer string sound that resulted when the f-holes of both violin sections were facing the audience.*<br />Sacrificing clarity for fullness of tone: the \\"Philadelphia Sound.\\"<br /><br />This new system also made it easier for musicians to stay together, and Twentieth century conductors came increasingly to adopt it<br />(bot not Toscanini or Furtwangler, both of whom passed away before stereo could document their divided violins).<br />Contemporaries of Klemperer who remained loyal to divided violins in the stereo age included Monteux, Boult, Bohm, Kubelik and Bruno Walter.<br />[Fritz Reiner's earliest Chicago Symphony stereo recordings had divided violins, but by 1957 he had given up and adopted massed violins on the left].<br /><br />Karl Bohm and the Berlin Philharmonic recorded the Mozart Symphonies with divided strings, but his recordings do not have the same sort of impact that Klemperer's do. I am tempted to blame the DG engineers.<br />Karl Bohm always reminded me of Otto Klemperer without all the personal baggage.<br />But I also think it was thebaggage, the mental and physical challenges Klemperer had to overcome, that made him great.<br />I'm afraid this is a hopelessly romantic view of life, but it is mine own.<br />[I'm actually rather fond of Karl Bohm].<br /><br />Listen to these CDs while seated directly between two high quality speakers. Better yet, use headphones.<br />Not only did Klemperer have the best-sounding recordings, I soon came to realize that he was a very great conductor.<br />To my mind, the greatest of them all, certainly in the modern stereo era.<br /><br />THE PERFORMANCES: Back in the 60s, hostile critics accused Klemperer of playing Haydn and Mozart like Beethoven.<br />Supposedly he didn't understand stylistic differences.<br />They may have had a point - Klemperer's Mozart is not graceful or stylish, two adjectives frequently applied to Mozart.<br /><br />Klemperer conducted Mozart (and everything else) with his fists and a scowl on his face.<br />He stood an intimidating 6 feet, 6 inches tall, and had a reputation (deserved) for mental instability and irrational behavior (nowadays he would be called bi-polar).<br />His intimidating appearance was the result of surgery to remove a brain tumor, which left him partially paralyzed for the last 30 years of his life.<br />The irrational behavior was with him all his life.<br />Intentional or not, this had an effect on orchestra players.<br /><br />These are tough, unyielding performances - try the Adagio & Fugue K 546 on CD 1 - not at all graceful or stylish.<br />But he can also be surprisingly tender - listen to the first two movements of Symphony 29 (CD 1) - this is the recording that sold me on Klemperer in the first place.<br /><br />The box includes two different stereo performances each of Symphonies 38, 39, 40 and Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.<br />Klemperer's first Philharmonia recordings of each date from 1956 and were released on mono LPs, but EMI has found the early stereo master tapes;<br />Symphony 38 (CD 7) is issued here for the first time in stereo.<br />Its a scandal that we had to wait 57 years to hear it in its full glory.<br /><br />The 1954 Symphonies 29 and 41 are still mono only.<br />Faster than usual tempos in these early recordings.<br />This was still Karajan's Philharmonia Orchestra (Dennis Brain led the horn section).<br />Klemperer re-recorded them in stereo in 1965 and 1962.<br /><br />There is a repeat in the first movement of Symphony 38 in 1956 = 13:20 (it would have been 10:37 without the repeat) vs. 10:53 in 1962.<br />There is a repeat in the first movement of Symphony 40 in 1956 = 8:36 (it would have been 6:26 without the repeat) vs. 6:38 in 1962.<br />There is a repeat in the finale of Symphony 41 in 1954 = 8:28 (it would have been 6:16 without the repeat) vs. 6:48 in 1962.<br /><br />Klemperer had a reputation for slow tempos, but don't worry.<br />10 of the 30 recordings were made in 1954-56, a time when Klemperer still had a reputation as a \\"fast\\" conductor (see his early '50s Vox recordings).<br />None of these is excessively fast (OK, maybe the 1954 Jupiter Symphony); more like \\"normal\\" to slightly fast tempos.<br /><br />18 recordings date from 1960-65; Klemperer had slowed down noticeably. Six of these were remakes of earlier recordings.<br />Allowing for missing repeats, the new recordings were 2% to 7% slower, but the new Jupiter was 13% slower.<br />In my subjective judgement, only it and Symphony 31 could be categorized as \\"sluggish.\\"<br />The rest are slightly slower than the norm, but not outrageously so.<br />Klemperer's slow tempos don't strike me as ponderous. I think its his sense of rhythm that keeps the forward motion going.<br />He leans heavily into the downbeat. Not subtle, but effective nonetheless.<br /><br />The Serenades 11 and 12 date from 1967-71, a time when Klemperer was notorious for alarmingly slow tempos.<br />These are not so afflicted, possibly because they are wind octets, and Klemperer wasn't required to do much in the way of conducting.<br /><br />INTERESTING NEWS: Check this out on Amazon UK (amazon.co.uk).<br />Unlike American Amazon, Amazon UK includes free 20 second samples for each movement of everything in the box.<br />Judge for yourself.<br /><br />REMASTERINGS: Of the 30 recordings in this box, 22 were remastered in 24-bit resolution by Abbey Road Technology (ART) between 2000 and 2006.<br />Only one recording was newly remastered in 2013: Symphony 38 (1956), issued in stereo for the first time.<br />Earlier remasterings: 1996 = Symphonies 29 & 41 (1954) - Testament remastering<br />1990 = Three Wind Serenades + Clemenza di Tito Overture<br />1987 = Symphony 40 (1956)<br /><br />Recommended.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved the film but the book leaves it to you to determine the true story..I will not say more for those who have not read it yet. Do recommend reading book before or after seeing film.
0525953728|5.0|The story kept me entertained through the whole book, especially since it is an event that will go down in history!
B003WQT2YY|5.0|I had not seen Amadeus in years and enjoyed so much to watch it again.  It brings you into the environment of MozartMs times.  Urban legend or not it makes a great story and the beautiful costumes and sets are so lush and yet so barren at times.  F. Murray Abraham brings so much to this role so much spirit and substance and was so interested to find out that both Mick Jagger and Mel Gibson tried for role of Mozart but Tom Hulce was definitely the right choice he played the role to the hilt.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper<br />The story was so cleverly staged with all the flash backs. The end made it all come together for a five star rating.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book catches a lot of the physical excitement of the submissive lifestyle, some of the flavor of a BDSM relationship.<br />This is pretty much kink tamed down for the greater reading public, though. I will probably not read the sequels.
0425252868|5.0|This book is extremely captivating, the book you can't put down once you begin reading. It is indeed  a strory of chivalry and compassion!
B00906J7KO|5.0|I thought the movie was a cute story,with good funny things going on.The grandkids laughed almost all the way through it.Love to see more like it thanks so much for making it
B002ZG9846|4.0|When i saw the previews i wasn't to keen on this movie till i saw it on television, it was excellent, the behind the scenes section is very motivating for newbie or experienced independent film makers
B00886XQO0|5.0|If u guys are in to FPS or any type of gaming and you have the money then this is the way to go think of it as a little something Special for yourself But overall great sound quality Easy to learn controls and the fit and finish is spot on!!!
B002PYW26Y|5.0|Somehow I missed this one when it first came out and had not seen it until I bought it recently.  The special effects were great and it had a good story line as well.  I highly recommend this film to scifi buffs.
B009X01C64|4.0|I just received this case today and it certainly meets my expectations. Snapping the Kindle into place takes a little effort but once it's in it feels very secure. The rotating feature is relatively smooth and easy to master.<br /><br />My only two negatives are: 1) that I'd rather it have some type of magnetic flap to keep it closed rather than the elastic strap and 2) the cost is pretty high. I've seen the same case listed on other shopping sites for $10-$15 less.<br /><br />All in all it's a great case that I would recommend to anyone.
B00005LK94|5.0|Wish they made all movies like this one. A great family movie. The young girl is a wonderful actress. It goes to the heart.

1416955070|5.0|I was in need of a new series, and this definitely got me good!  As a fan of other supernatural series I was interested with the slight twist that Cassandra Clare offered thru The Mortal Instruments.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|I enjoy this movie in the same way I enjoy [[ASIN:B004CEUEWE The Town]].  The good guy is a bit bad but ultimately wants to do the right thing for his family - wants some kind of redemption.<br /><br />This story is filled with counterfeit money, art smuggling, drug trafficking and interesting relationships that make for a great story.  Giovanni Ribisi does a great job of playing the wacked out gangster type.  Marky Mark plays a character who has tried to go clean but needs to do some more \\"business\\" to raise money to solve a family issue.  He moves back into what he already knows ... smuggling and counterfeiting.<br /><br />A great cat and mouse movie.  Watched it multiple times already and it doesn't get old.  Love it.

B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This is a great alternative album.  I love hard driving acoustic guitars, which the Lumineers so richly deliver.  When I first heard \\"Ho Hey\\" on the radio, I used Shazam to tag it and then listened to the track samples here on Amazon. I was hooked and ordered the CD.<br /><br />If you enjoy Alternative Music that leans towards acoustic instruments, you will love this album

B008XX6J4C|4.0|Great CD. However, a little disappointed that the music on the CD wasn't the length of the videos. I love the videos and watch with my kids and expected the same length and quality on the CD. It's only on a couple if songs. However, they happened to be favorites. Still amazing. And would recommend. Others may not hear what I did.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|At first it was running great and had the potential to be a very addictive game. If you remember the game Win Lose or Draw it is similar to that. Now it freezes all the time. I have force closed it and uninstalled it and then reinstalled it and nothing seems to help. I wish it continued to run as good as it did the first day I got it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the book that everyone has been talking about?!?!?!?!?! I found it to be ridiculous....no real character development ...no real storyline. I honestly think it may be the worst written book that I have ever read. I can't believe women are recommending it to one another. I didn't find it &#34;erotic&#34; because of the lack of substance. I wish I could get my money back. This book is a disaster. I cannot believe this author is making &#34;bank&#34; on this creation.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I LOVE Chris Colfer on Glee, but did not know what to expect in him writing a fantasty book...............wow! was I wrong!  This book was a blast to read.  The charcters and depth of the classics that he put into his versions are incredible. Cannot wait for another adventure with these two twins.  Keep it up Chris.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I was hesitant to dabble in this odd topic of a documentary but eventually, out of sheer bordem, gave it a go. Opening and closing with beautiful and elegant music, \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" is filled with lessons from an aged master. Although the story revolves around sushi, the emphasis is how to prosper in life and succeed. It doesn't blanket these with simple \\"how to\\" moments or \\"never fail\\" methods, but inserts inspirational blunt one-liners that cut to the heart of living life with a job. It is no surprise that Jiro excels in his field, neither is it a surprise that his children stand great on their own. A great movie filled with serenity and joy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I play it all the time. It kept me interested & wanting to play more, I like the way it got harder as you moved on.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was great and I could not stop reading it. This is by far the best book that I have read that cost me only 99 cents. There is a lot of technical jargon and mathematics in the book. Because of this I could see where it would not be for everyone. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in space or science fiction.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great story line , details were well incorporated, I was on the edge anticipating the ending of the story , Nicholas Sparks is definitley one of my favorite authors .
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I need to re-read the book.  The murderer wasn't of the two people I was assuming him to be.  Need to find out about that guy.

B009RI4FRU|3.0|this is a dry humor movie. I liked it but would not watch again. Just kind of slow going but it has a lot of good actors in it which is why, imo, that it works.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Funny I thought it was I think it was good from all the series and books real good Ya lol
B002RSDW80|5.0|I bought this for my mother and she loved it. This is a great movie and a great idea for a gift!
B001AQT0RC|4.0|I liked this Movie because of the Actors & Actresses. I WISH THEY WOULD REMAKE THE FILM WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGIE & BETTER TELESCOPES EST. Didn't really dislike the film different all I can say story line could been a little better. I would recommend this Movie too any that likes Movies by Jodie Foster & Matthew McConaughey. It's an older Movie which is cool still has some of the old Technologie but where this Movie was filmed reminds me of Alaska because of the Satellites. Theirs a place in Alaska called HAARP where they have hundreds of Satellites that make one this Video but where this video was recorded says in new Mexico it may have been but just saying.
0307010856|5.0|I bought this book for a youngster in my life and remember it from when I was little. I reread it and think it is one of the most fun books for a wee one!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|AWESOME  book!!!!<br />I was waiting to read it (don't ask me why), and now I just want to tell everybody how wonderful this masterpiece is ;<br />go for it you guys&#34;
B004BSFC46|5.0|i put these around my 4-month old granddaughter's wrists or ankles and it brings her attention to it.  so much fun to watch her reach for it, whether it's on her wrist or &#34;far away&#34; on her ankle.  they are a great size, not too big, easy to use, have a pleasant rattle and crackly sounds.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|SO SO DOES NOT HAVE A THING ON THE BACK TO TASKE PICS ONLY USING IN FRONT OF MY KINDLE
1449410243|4.0|My only complaint would be the amount of comics :( Some pages fit 8 boxes in, while others only have 2. Otherwise, I love this guy's writing!
B008XG1X18|4.0|it is a great idea, I llike seeing the things put on the site.  I am looking forward to learning what all I can do.,
B00632HWOG|4.0|Would rather use Reagan.com but cannot afford it.  W/ yahoo mail I get everything and more than I bargained for.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|this game is great if you have the patience, the only thing I don't like is that you have to use real money to purchase the peanuts to get any of the special features, if they would give you this special currency for special quests I might give it the fifth star ....
B002JWD6AS|4.0|Shiver, is an almost mysteric book that will have you at the edge if your pants at times. This book is entertaining and keeps the reader guessing. Makes you want to read the second book in the series, Linger.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game - I have played it for years and I am now so excited that I can play it on my kindle!
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Funny, and believable.  Having worked with choirs and student groups I saw the humor.  I will watch it more than once and probably laugh every time.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Halestorm is an 80's throwback hair band with an exciting contemporary sound.  Led by frontwoman LZ Hale, the album has everything you want in a rock album, even a couple of power ballads that will have you singing along.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Good sound quality, easy to install (already have Logitech Mouse / Keyboard).<br /><br />Wish the battery lasted a little longer, but if you get in the habit of plugging it in when you're done using it, it's not bad.<br /><br />Plugging in the micro-USB connecter is a little tight.  Might be because it's relatively new.  I may put some nail polish on the plug, though, because figuring out which way is &#34;up&#34; isn't very obvious.
B004SIP9U6|5.0|This movie is so clever, so wonderful.  The acting is superb, the sets and costumes are divine, the dialogue is perfection.  Shakespeare himself would be delighted.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|well.... the reviews were great so i got it. it took forever to download in, and after i played once and closed it, it wouldnt open again. it just had a black screen. im on my kindle fire tuat doesnt have much downloaded onto it..... if i have to undowload it again i am not going to get it back.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|always a good read, interesting adventures. jack reacher is a laymen's james bond. i support the military!  tom cruise miscast in the movie, i see someone else. like, anyone else.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|Plague Inc. is fun for a few playthroughs. There are a lot of ways you can play, and trying to discover the best strategy is entertaining as you try different combinations and upgrades. Unfortunately, there is a winning strategy that basically guarantees victory, and that point the game is a bit boring. If you can't figure out that strategy, the game can be a bit frustrating. Worth the $.99, but won't last long.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book can't wait to read the next one<br />I would say she is a good writer on to last book
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I am not a huge Sophie Kinsella fan (in fact I tend to like the author's books written as Madeline Wickham better), but I do read them as light, chicklit diversions when I need a dose of that. This one fit the bill perfectly, and I ended up liking it better than most of hers, because the heroine Lara is just as good-hearted as Kinsella's other typical heroines, but not quite so self-centered or flaky. By the end she is in fact quite a good businesswoman, and has her life together. However, this has a supernatural twist that some may find too incredible - the plot centers around Lara's relationship with the ghost of her great-aunt Sadie, a spunky character stuck in the 1920s. I found this aspect very fanciful, and the gentle back-themes on aging and what family means to be genuinely touching. Of course there is also romance, and intrigue, and the usual rom-com like misunderstandings and plot manipulations typical of a Kinsella novel, so certainly you shouldn't read it if that bothers you. But otherwise, you may find this one a fun and fanciful diversion, with a bit of heart.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This was a sleeper for sure .You knew what was going to happen before it happened a slow read. fifty shades finished!!!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I actually was not expecting to like this movie based on what I'd read about it - I thought it was going to be for the 'Hangover' crowd, with lots of boy-centric raunch. And it does have its share of that, but I didn't think it was as bad as the Hangover movies in that regard, and it's truly FUNNY, so that makes it worth it for me. What made it especially enjoyable was the performances and the heart at the center of it. The basic theme of a boy whose teddy-bear comes to life is carried off brilliantly, and serves as a great vehicle for the 'it's time for boy to grow into man' theme, which of course has been done to death, and needed an overhaul. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are both excellent, and lift it a bit above the standard comedies of this type. Seth MacFarlane as the voice of Ted was hilarious. I don't watch Family Guy, so can't speak to the complaints that Ted is basically a revamp of that character. The plot was so-so - standard rom-com breakup-get-back-together stuff, but it's the ride along the way that is truly unique and fun.
B000YL98RG|5.0|Good acting, good story, good plot and a good ending. It even shows you how to pick up girls that you never would have expected to be interested in you.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This movie just never quite clicked for me, and I'm surprised by all the positive reviews. On the plus side, I really liked the Griffin character, and his quantum abilities to see multiple outcomes/realities at once. That made for fun cinema, and was the best part of the movie for me. However, the old characters felt stale, and because the plot involves a shift back in time (I don't want to go into too much detail so as not to spoil it), Tommy Lee Jones is not in a large chunk of it, since his younger self is played by Josh Brolin. And although Josh Brolin is good as the young Agent K, I didn't feel the chemistry between him and Will Smith was as strong as it is between Jones and Smith (and that was such a big part of the earlier movies.) I also felt the director went a little overboard with the gooey, gross special effects, and that this also took time away from the 'buddy movie' dynamic that made the first two so successful. There were funny moments to be sure, and if you were a fan of the first two you'll enjoy this one too, but 3, 3 1/2 stars at best for me.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|fun story line. easy to use hint button. enjoyed the assistants from the monkey.  wished the game was longer. i have played alot of these games and this one is really unique.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I bought this for my wife and her new kindle fire and she absolutley loves it . She really loves the color that was ordered for her .

B008D36INE|2.0|I enjoy British films, especially with these stars, however, the film felt disjointed, verrrrrry slooooow and it was difficult to maintain my interest even though I watched it all the way through.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Suspence kept building.  Just when I thought I figured out the ending a new twist came.  I could not put the book down.
1419705849|5.0|The newest book...I pre-ordered for a great price, and my son read this within a day - He loves all the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.  He's read them over and over, and never gets tired of them
0307744434|4.0|Last January RGV Book Junkies chose our first selection, The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern, a love story about two rival illusionists who are a part of a competition that they don't know much about. Although I didn't consider their love \\"epic\\" as the books description promises, I did enjoy Marco and Celia. I liked how they grew from students to magicians to independent individuals who chose their own path against all obstacles.<br /><br />I was hooked from the start. Before I read \\"The circus arrives without a warning,\\" I read the word \\"Anticipation,\\" and immediately felt it. I didn't stop reading until the story ended and when I read the last line, I almost cried. Sappy I know, but I am a romantic at heart and I fell in love with the people and culture of this circus.<br /><br />Ms. Morgenstern described everything with such detail that I imagined it all perfectly. I saw every character, card deck, striped tent, costume, and even dinner as a painting on a 4' x 6' canvas above my mantel. I thought to myself \\"I am reading ART\\" a few times during my journey in the Night Circus. Don't even get me started on the clock ;-)<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its pretty addicting all the daily challenges and everything its just that its preety slow to update.... iphone version of this game os faster please give the update out early soo.. that we may all enjoy it before its taken out....<br />THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!:)
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Fun to look inside and see the inner workings of the baseball world.  There is a lot to learn about doing things in a way they have never been done before.
B00170DEM8|5.0|This was the first time that I had seen this movie but we watch White Christmas every year.  Still prefer that one, but this one was quite good
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Young grandson enjoyed it but had some problems navigating because of it being on the Kindle, probably not the fault of the app.  I have not had time to try it.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|The first in the series, (hopefully many more to come) is everything I was hoping for and much more. Thankyou.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I don't usually read a novel twice, but this series is one I'll probably read way more than twice. I've read all the titles available to date & can hardly wait for the next to be published!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I could not put this book down! I cried like a baby.  I was hopeful all the way to the end.
B002ZG999U|4.0|i'm a big fan of explosions and blood splatter so this was my kind of movie! One liners are great
B00571F26Y|5.0|I ( and this is the point of view of an &#34;illiterate&#34;)  believe Dr. Davis to be at the vanguard of  Science with this book.  At the risk of sounding like a &#34;radical&#34; the Food Industry is ( like the Tobacco Companies before) lying  to protect their interest  and  Dr. Davis exposes them with the sole intent of awakening the American Public to the risk of eating  their &#34; Healthy  GMO's&#34;.<br />  It's a terrific Book,  full of info about  Diabetes which was the reason  for Him to write it, and well researched showing the Author to be well versed on the subject and very sincere when it comes to call everyone  by it's real name...! If  Dr. Davis is a conspirator against  the  &#34; Agro&#34;  I will gladly joint his &#34;ranks&#34;  as I would  joint &#34;Oprah&#34; against the meat industry and/or Christopher Bryson  against the Fluoride Case, etc.<br />  Definitively a book to be read and if possible to be followed to alleviate or regress Diabetes.
B0053O89RY|4.0|This product was shipped faster than anything I have ever bought before. Only problem was it was brand new but we have had some problems with the discs skipping
B0029XFNA8|5.0|Very good quality and of course it's one of the best Christmas movies! Blu-ray is so much better than your standard disc.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|Lovely story, sad at times because of the young woman's feelings about herself, but believable because of those feelings. Well written, and another book I didn't want to end.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I keep finding myself conning back to play the game! I hope I don&acute;t have to spend a bunch of money on it though.
0425252868|5.0|This book tells the stories of two WWII soldiers whose &#34;job&#34; it was to go kill the enemy: each other. There's a governmental mandate to defend a country, there's a conscientious duty to do the right thing according to one's worldview, then there is a higher call. Get it, read it, pass it on!
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Very fun and addictive! You have 3 planes to chose from and can land at base or on a carrier. Replay your landing or crash!, and enjoy!
B004T6IBNY|4.0|Four different games.  Enough to keep you amused in the doctors waiting room if the TV is on and making it difficult to read.<br />I like the Brix game the best
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|Scared my younger children. Didn't think it was as funny as the previews.  Had to explain a lot to the kids because they didn't get it.
B004SI893A|5.0|I have read all of his books and love them all.  I usually will read one in a day.  The books are easy to read and intriguing.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really loved the middle chapters of the novel, then towards the end it became too contrived to follow intelligently. Great idea for a story but it lost me at the point of Jake returning to 2011 at the conclusion of the book. Hard to follow the logic, if there was any.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I haven't read a book so intellectual, so perfectly worded and pictured, in a very, very long time. Touching on societies views of death, it's made me question my own thoughts and morals. There's more and less that we can all do..
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game. I would recommend to all my friends. Amazing graphics and plot great characters as well. Ask should play.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This is a great case. Indestructible, waterproof, dust proof, drop proof. Very well thought out and designed. However, there are two sacrifices: touchscreen sensitivity is altered so takes a bit of getting used to;  external speaker volume is greatly reduced (not too bad for voice play, but ringer is REALLY reduced).
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Are you an Angry Birds fan?  Well this lets you see things from the other perspective.  Now you can go after those yummy eggs!
B0063GORYU|5.0|i like the one suit type-easy.  i like the way this one plays, the way the cards move.  this is versatile enough to try other levels.
038572179X|5.0|Atonement is an excellent novel written by Ian McEwan. It is about a young girl named Briony's misperception of a love affair between her sister, Cecilia, and her family friend Robbie. Briony is a very immature individual living in her own fantasy world, spoiled greatly by her parents. She finds time to write stories and plays. She didn't construe a love affair between her sister and family friend properly and saw Robbie as an insane animal trying to hurt her sister, and in turn gets Robbie and very big trouble sent off to jail; isolating him from his true love Cecilia. Finally after serving prison and in World War 2, Robbie is reunitied with his lover and can't be happier. Cecilia has isolated herself completely from her family and is angry at them for COMPLETELY blowing her love out of proportion because of her sister's misperception. I agree with Friederike Knabe's belief on Briony, she never does grow up and still remains a small immature child at heart. The author uses imagery very well, describing Briony \\"breaking in to a loping run across the grass and thought he could go all night\\" (McEwan 147). McEwan really highlights character personality through words, well describing Briony as very childish here. I would recommend this book to a friend, very complex and sad plot. An emotional roller coaster.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|i love playing angry birds, but this version has too many popups going from one sublevel to another and they require input to go on to the next.  i would have given it less stars because of this, but i do love angry birds.
B005KIQDYE|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughters (6 and 3).  They love it.  Pictures are easy to follow.  I did not see the playset but my daughters tells me it is really well designed.
B007RFDCQA|5.0|One of my favorite flicks as i am obsessed with 80's flicks (especially those with appearances from members of the &#34;brat pack&#34;) and I often put this on just to have on in the background, although it's hard to resist from quoting or dancing with Duckie does!  Great Film, Good quality!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Easy to learn, hard to perfect. This game is addicting. I keep wanting to try \\"one more run.\\" I haven't had any performance problems with the app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The tutorial is very informative and complete. Only wish it were easier to obtain gems, and coins, somewhat. New player, but from what I've seen its very fun.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'd been accessing Facebook through the browser on my Kindle, and the app is a bit better than that. Features seem more accessible, and of course it's easier to get into the program itself this way. I haven't had any functionality problems.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|This game is awesome it's fun it's a little challenging and extremely addictive I bought it last night and have had a hard time putting it down, for those of you who have played trails extreme  or trials extreme 2  and enjoyed it this one will NOT disappoint it's even better with new obstacles and they have added some cool new features like now you can earn in game money and buy new bikes and also dress your rider in a variety of different cloths they give you the option to buy in game money but so far I have  not had the need you seam to earn plenty by just playing the game, on the last version people complained about the developer adding stars that you could collect through out the levels they say that it took away from the realism of the game but I think it just added a little extra challenge, well they have them again and the more stars you collect the more in game money you get.<br /> I play it on my kindle fire hd and my LG lucid my husband plays it on his kindle fire works great on all,<br />M husband my teenage son and I love this game well worth the $2.99 I would have  payed more, can't wait to see how the developer will top this one please keep up the great work thank you
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome this is a awesome book you should get this book and its making me type alot of words :)
B009XTF8KQ|2.0|Time seems to move at a glacial pace in Hollywood.  Somewhere, it's still shortly after \\"The Ring\\" was released, where that \\"spooky little girl\\" thing is still happening.  And somewhere, someone is trying to remind neglectful parents (lest they forget \\"The Exorcist\\") that their children just might get possessed and turn on them.  Such is the alternate timeline where this film came from.  It's a mind-bogglingly crazy take on the internet-born legend of the Dibbuk Box.  The true story in itself (which they go into scant detail on in the special features) is actually pretty spooky.  This film, however, is a joke.  If you've seen one sweaty little girl writhing and growling in man-voice you've seen them all.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick play the befuddled and neglectful parents who never ONCE earn our sympathies as the girl writhes around, eats raw steak on all-fours in the kitchen late at night, and vomits moths all over her sister.  It's just too much to take and not for a moment is it believable.  It also contains yet another example of the \\"Let's sap all the color from every frame since it's horror\\" style of film-making, a confounding trend that makes every shot look like it was filmed through a cup of fog.<br /><br />Skip it.  There is one and ONLY one Exorcism movie worth seeing and that particular lightning in the bottle will never again be recaptured.<br /><br />For some real scares, check out the REAL story of the Dibbuk Box which I will not link to here.  Google it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I recommend this game if you love tower defense games. I have brothers that will not stop asking me to play this game they love it so much!
B002M9WW30|5.0|This is a great Blu-ray Rocky box set, you get all six movies. I loved these movies though part five was a let down in some ways. All in all still worth buying.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the gems are a pain in the but and cost a lot!! if there was easier way to get gems this would be five star
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I don't say any of this lightly! I rarely watch movies more than once, maybe it has happened 10 times in my life. I have NEVER seen a movie twice in the theater. Here is the exception. The movie was so well done, it was beautiful. Certain songs are not as good in the movie as they are in the actual musical, however it did not take away from the story in any way. I have seen it twice in theaters now, have already pre-ordered it so I can see it the day it comes out on Bluray, and I really want to go see it yet again in theaters. Great cast.
0312427646|4.0|This is a laugh-out-funny work of fiction by an English playwright which I happened to notice had over 3000 listings on LibraryThing but of which I has never heard.  So since our library had the book I thought I should read it.  It has a kitchen worker in the palace who reads books introduce the queen to reading, and she becomes thoroughly caught up in reading. And proceeds to neglect all the things whcih she is supposed to do and has for over 50 years done conscientiously.  It is quite improbable, and not overly reverential of the queeen or her ministers.  But it is fun to read and only 120 pages.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is now my preferred music app. Yes, it's that nice! Jeez I'm getting tired of typing just to hit the stupid minimum.
0670026603|5.0|I read this novel when my mom was critically ill in the hospital, while curled up in a chair beside her bed, not knowing if she would live through the night.  I did not think anything could distract me from the fear and grief I was feeling - but this book did.  It took me into a world that was different from mine but still spoke right to me; about a young woman dealing with pain and loss and love and fear all at once; laughing and having adventures in the midst of the most devastating injury imaginable.  It was a book about what makes life worth living, and how to make your life count.  But it wasn't preachy or saccharine.  I don't read romance novels, I only occasionally read chick lit; but I loved every single syllable in this book.  In case Ms. Moyes ever reads her Amazon reviews, I want her to know that this book came to me when I desperately needed it; it brought me joy and hope and showed me how all of those things can exist even in the midst of grief and loss.  It did just what I think the best literature is meant to do.  It makes you feel something powerful, and it shows you a new lens through which to view your life.  I am begging everyone I know to read it.  I can't imagine reading anything that moves me more this year.  Thank you, Ms. Moyes.  (And please get your earlier novels published on the Kindle or back in print, so I can get those too - I already picked up Last Letter from Your Lover and that's my next read.)
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|If you really want a great alarm, get the paid version of this app! It's seriously a great alarm for Kindle fire.

B0090EJR1K|5.0|So funny! Really enjoyed it. You have to be open minded to watch it though and you will enjoy it. I think it's the best out of the Sasha Baron Cohen movies. A lot better then Borat or Bruno.
B004Y042N8|1.0|This game is just plain boring. Might be OK for kids who are learning shapes and such, but much too easy for adults.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Despite several other writers whom I follow closely are on the Edgar this, this is my pick for best novel. Well-crafted. Twists and turns that the reader has a hard time guessing and such a surprise ending for the average reader and a surprise even for the well-read
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I had to get back here and edit my review. Lately I've been getting bombarded with ads, trying to get me to buy Weather live, which is the developers other app. This is a huge violation of \\"app etiquette\\". I would expect this in a free app, but NEVER IN A PAID APP!!! If this developer does not fix this very soon, I will dump this app and go to something else. It's only an alarm clock after all. The site is full of them. It's also apparently full of greedy developers.....    This Alarm app works just like it says it should. It integrates with the Kindle so you can select music you have on your Kindle as your alarm sound. Very nice, and works very well. Great look, and great features. BUT THEN THE ADS STARTED AND RUINED THE DAMNED THING.
B003204MQS|1.0|I have only watched 1 \\"horror\\" movie in 15 years so not very familiar with these things. Only know that the director must done some serious research on \\"spiritual attacks\\" that are very common in 3rd world countries. In the US too but people just ignore it or call it \\"sleep paralysis.\\" The only way to overcome this is through faith in Jesus, its hard to believe but true. low stars because I dont think people should watch this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this app to my new Kindle Fire HD that I received for Christmas. I've played with it for about a month now &amp; I've never had any problems with it. I really like how you can customize your own background! Great app! I love it!!
159562015X|4.0|This book is a classic and I bought it to give to my nephew to help him find the right career. I'm happy with my career so I'm guessing I'm not the target audience but I can see how it has endured.  With 2 million copies in print, I'm going to defer to the masses and suggest to anyone who hasn't found their \\"right\\" career yet to buy Strengthfinders.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Notebook is real life!  Love never ends  The most heart warming story to come along in years and years.  This is a must watch for all married couples.  My mother-in-law watched it and she was in tears - she rarely cries.<br />The cast of actors were perfect.  James Garner was so-o-o good and Ryan Gosling's smile was so believable!
B009GEYX5E|5.0|We ordered two packages for our daughter as a Christmas present. We found a 600 series polaroid in a thrift store but couldn't find film that still worked anywhere. She knows to be mindful of how often she uses the film since it is a bit on the spendy side, but not overly inflated in price like some other products we came across.

Even I, as a professional jazz musician, was able to relate to Bourdain's views on work ethic and professionalism. His incite into city life and his outlook on life is very interesting. Finally Bourdain is an incredible writer who keeps the reader wanting more. Must read!
B0011UBDTK|2.0|The DVD's started to freeze around season 3, and I messaged Amazon for an exchange.  A new one arrived the next day...but it also skips around season 3, 4, and 5.  Some episodes don't even play!  High price for a horrible quality item.<br /><br />The aggravation is not worth the price.  I bought this as a gift for my significant other, and we are highly disappointed.  This disc set makes me feel like a bad boyfriend every time we watch it because there are so many issues with it.<br /><br />**Edit: 1/25/13...Episode 5 of Season Six does NOT play.  The first time I tried, it played episode one.  the second and third times it booted me back to the main menu.  ALSO, they gave us NO disc 1 for season 6.  They gave us two disc 2's instead.

B009HEJXFS|3.0|This is just Hollywood trying to cash in, on the sequel bandwagon. I would just pass on this one. One.
0060853972|4.0|This was a fun book. I had to start it four times before I felt caught up by the story well enough to see it through to the end. But I enjoyed it.<br /><br />In answer to the question, What kept me from reading straight through? it was Adam Young. One of the protagonists in the tale (more on that later). Adam's story doesn't grab me right away, and given the nature of the book, it's hard to find a character to take hold of for the ride to the finish line until you get a bit farther along. By then, you're invested in all of their outcomes, owing to the clever storytelling Gaiman and Pratchett engage in.<br /><br />You see, this isn't a story about a boy named Adam Young anymore than it's a story about you, or me, or an old man who happened to stumble down a mountainside carrying stone tablets etched with rules, or runes and quite possibly both. Adam is one protagonist in a sea of billions. The antagonists, for their part, are just doing their jobs.<br /><br />The story follows all of us on the road to oblivion, with Adam as the vessel, and not a particularly endearing one, IMO, so \\"getting into the story\\" was difficult.<br /><br />I'm a writer and I write reviews from a writer's perspective. For me, Good Omens showcases both Gaiman's and Pratchett's talent for creating vivid, imaginative, spooky, foreboding, and humorous scenarios populated by intriguing if not always compelling characters. And for any writers looking for an outstanding example of how to \\"head jump\\" (i.e., change perspective from one character to another throughout a story) Good Omens is your go-to for study.

B00A1XIXM8|4.0|Over the last 30 years, Southern California punk rockers Bad Religion have become an institution. They have established themselves as one of the hardest working bands, never taking more than a few years off between records. Although they hit a period of decline starting in the mid 90s, most of their work since 2002's The Process of Belief has been as sure as a smoking solo sizzling off the strings of Brett Gurewitz's guitar. True North marks their 16th full length album, and once again they've opened a tantalizing bag of tricks for their fans.<br /><br />True North avoids the pitfalls that some of their weaker albums have fallen into. When Bad Religion albums go awry, it's either because they're trying to churn out an overproduced  syrupy mess for the Warped Tour crowd, or else there isn't enough melody and it gets boring. The production on their latest album is more sugary than its predecessor, 2010's Dissent of Man, though True North holds the advantage of being more consistent.<br /><br />Dissent of Man was a good record in its own right but it had a different tone from most of their recent works; it felt more like a melodic rock and roll record that just happened to politically conscious. True North gets back to the business of punk rock. The closest comparison within their discography would be Against the Grain. Pushing 50, Greg Graffin and crew don't possess the same level of anger they had then, but the sonic aggression and sense of urgency on True North bear strong parallels to the band's landmark 1990 release, Against the Grain.<br /><br />As usual, Bad Religion exercise their penchant for well thought out, in your face political lyrics. \\"Robin Hood in Reverse\\" sees Graffin blasting the Supreme Court for their 2008 decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which asserted that corporations are people and gave them wide latitude to make campaign contributions to political candidates.<br /><br />\\"Past is Dead,\\" meanwhile, takes the general public to task for their slovenly approach to education.  It discusses how people don't pay attention to history, and therefore don't have the advantage of historical precedent upon which to base their decisions. Graffin unloads: \\"Who can say what constitutes the most important sector of society?/ The dominant portion seek an instant gratification/ And are proud of intellectual poverty.\\"<br /><br />Yet in the same breath, Bad Religion are a band also capable of taking a much more subtle approach by speaking in thought provoking metaphor. The album's title track talks about trying to find a location on a map and using it as a metaphor for finding your own moral code. The catchy, driving and forceful delivery fully drives the point home.<br /><br />Also of note is lead single \\"F*** You,\\" which basically says you don't always need a well thought out argument; sometimes you just need to say f*** you! The tempo varies throughout the song, tossing in a tasty guitar solo following a slow paced bridge.<br /><br />\\"Hello Cruel World\\" is the album's sole slow tempo song, and by far the album's longest cut at just under four minutes. The slower pace allows the band to focus on their harmony section, an often overlooked component of Bad Religion's sound. It leads into a flowing guitar solo before the song's final refrain, with powerful clashes coming from drummer Brooks Wackerman near the end.<br /><br />\\"Head Full of Ghosts,\\" \\"In Their Hearts is Right,\\" and \\"Popular Consensus\\" sound the most like old school Against the Grain or No Control era Bad Religion with their punishing and frenetic fury. \\"Popular Consensus\\" in particular is very intriguing, as Graffin seems to be modifying an old position that once seemed ironclad for him. He approaches matters from the government's position, asserting that just because the public demands something doesn't mean they are necessarily right. His claim that \\"popular consensus doesn't mean much to me\\" is evidence of dramatic development of thought for a man who once argued so forcefully for the role of citizen in government on 1987's \\"You Are the Government.\\"<br /><br />The biggest musical departure comes on \\"Dharma and the Bomb,\\" a sun soaked retro tune which sees Gurewitz taking lead vocal, referencing I Dream of Genie and the Bhagavad Gita in his ominous lower register.<br /><br />True North succeeds in all of the key areas a Bad Religion album needs to deliver, and should satisfy fans hungry for more. It presents a decided contrast to Dissent of Man, which was a much more thoughtful and mellowed out album. It would have been intriguing to see what the band could have accomplished had they pushed that sound further, though True North captures a well done take on the sound they've spent the better part of three decades championing.

0547848412|5.0|What is the novel about?  It sounds familiar and I've heard the title somewhere, asked a weathered acquaintance of mine from Scotland awhile ago who doesn't have much time to read on his farm in the hills near Aberdeen.  We were having an early lunch at his family cottage over salmon cakes and chips while old Shep his border collier was hoping for a scrap or two from the kitchen table.  It's about a young boy shipwrecked on a lifeboat with a tiger and what happens next, I told him. It's quite an adventure, and I probably wouldn't have picked it up years ago if it hadn't been for the intriguing cover.  None of my friends have read it because it gets graphic when it comes to some of the animals in the book, and then not everybody in this day and age wants to read about being cast away on a desert island, or marooned on the big blue sea.  The pace is slow for their sometimes frenetic schedule, and they would prefer a fast-action thriller both entertaining and somewhat forgettable while enjoying it at the time.  They have a need to stretch out.<br /><br />Did you like it?, continued my kindly host reaching for the bottle of salad cream sauce while I gave Shep the Hopeful a small piece of fish. Very much. In fact it's a keeper and I've read it about twice over the last decade.  'That good, is it?', my friend asked quizzically. You bet. I think you would like it and in some ways you might find that it keeps you on your toes as to what you would do in a situation like that.  In fact, I'd be interested in hearing what you have to say about it if you want to read it.  It would be quite different from what I felt if only because you might manage to survive the ordeal, and you can give me your own insights afterwards. Here I smiled at him because he's found himself in some dangerous situations on occasion when it comes to outings on the sea.<br /><br />The boy Pi is 16, I continued, and he's from India.  His father owns a zoo which he wants to take to America in the hopes of making a better livelihood for his family and then the ship they're on goes under, and Pi finds himself fighting for his life from the beginning and really all through the rest of the story until nearly the end.  What about the tiger and why is he there?  Why doesn't the boy just throw him overboard?, my luncheon companion suggested with a slight twinkle in his eye. Yeah? Well, Richard Parker is a huge Bengal tiger and an excellent swimmer for starters.  It's not that easy although naturally Pi has to give it some serious thought in the beginning.  No human survivors around in this tale? pursued my listener with some interest.  Possibly, I replied but we don't know if this is the case.  We are just on a journey with young Pi and the dangerous tiger in the boat and it becomes a question of live and let live; a somewhat one-sided question with a growing element of mutual if sullen respect.  Then a few things eventually happen over a length of time.  In the meantime and in the beginning, Pi has his hands full just trying to stay alive and saving Richard Parker because in the end they're both hungry, lonely and lost,and gradually an uneasy bond forms between Man and Animal while  there's more going on in this story than just this.  The novel broadens out in many directions and on the literary horizon.<br /><br />Now if you want to know more, I'll give you the book to read and we can discuss it afterwards.  It sounds like something that I might like, said my friend, and a bit different I might add, while he paused.  Well the book is somewhat controversial, I tacked on, because it has a religious take to it and this is cause for debate among the readers and reviewers.  I chose to read it as an adventure story which made me look to the heavens sometimes and reflect, and I have to also say that the ending did make me laugh quite a lot.  The author is an adventure craftsman and skilled writer when it came to putting this story together.  And, back to 'Save The Tiger', long before the end of the book I cared for both Pi and the ungrateful Richard Parker who always remains ferocious in his weakest moments.  Yes? asked my listener.  'Okay, let's put it this way.  He never gives his big paw to the boy and thanks him for looking after him, or gives him a roar of appreciation for all his efforts.  But having said that, I'll give a roar of appreciation to the author for having put this masterpiece together.  It couldn't have been easy and must have required hard work on his part.  I believe he may have written a saga that possibly will be remembered twenty or even more years from now and may continue to have a good readership.  He and Pi deserve this to happen.<br /><br />As for tigers, Richard Parker sounds all that a tiger should be.  And, for the teens of this world such as Pi, they exist if one looks around carefully and they are to be found in different forms and ways.  You see them and recognize them at their young age because there is a certain light in their eyes that gives one a feeling of joy.  If I have to sum it up, they inspire us with hope and a feeling of renewal, and this is enough to make one feel spiritual at times.  Congratulations to Yann Martell for bringing Pi to the fore and giving this reader some important moments to reflect on the wonders of this world.fore the end of the book I cared for both Pi and the ungrateful Richard Parker who always remains ferocious in his weakest moments.

0765325950|4.0|For me, the answer is an unequivocal yes.<br /><br />Ten years into the series, when we all saw that this was going to be many, many volumes, there was quiet muttering along the lines of, \\"Robert Jordan had better not die before he finishes this series.\\" I don't think any of us really expected it to happen, but we talked about it. We've all seen how /that/ turned out.<br /><br />So after a brief period of confused anticipation, it's announced that some literary upstart by the name of Brandon Sanderson will be taking over and finishing the series using RJ's notes and writing team. I'm sure I wasn't the only person who tilted his head a bit reading that (to quote a great comedian, \\"like the look your dog gives your answering machine when your voice comes out of it\\") and immediately ran to Google to enlighten me.<br /><br />\\"Who is this Brandon Sanderson fellow to take the reins of The Greatest Fantasy Series Ever Written? Alas, is there any hope?\\" So I picked up Mistborn to see if he had what it would take to bring The Story of My Young Adulthood to completion. My initial appraisal: yes. So I moved on to Warbreaker. I was no less impressed. By then, I was not only sold on Brandon finishing the series, he became my favorite living fantasy author. I then read his short story \\"Firstborn\\" and then his first published novel, Elantris. I was impressed with both. Elantris, in fact, I enjoyed even more than Mistborn. It is so incredibly rare to find a completely stand-alone, single-volume fantasy novel.<br /><br />So, Brandon vetted, on to the actual book review.<br /><br />It can be assumed that if you've read every previous book already, there's nothing I can type that would talk you out of finishing it. Not that I would try! So I'll just generally touch on the key attributes of the book. Anyone who's reading this review (or any review on MoL) but has yet to begin the series, go immediately to The Eye of the World. I'm going to try to keep this spoiler-free, but really, \\"It's always best to start at the beginning.\\"<br /><br />I've known the main characters of this series, Rand, Mat, Perrin, Bela, Tam, Egwene, Nynaeve, Moiraine, Lan, for longer than I've known any of my current friends. I'm *ahemrhd* years old, and over the last 20 years I've lost touch with every friend I had growing up. But I never lost touch with the people of the Westlands. Sure, we had a rough patch there 10 books in or so, but we talked it out and all was forgiven. This book paid dividends just in my being able to bring some closure to these stories.<br /><br />First point: this book is dense. It easily has enough content that it could have been split /again/, possibly even into three books. Time constraints aside (Sanderson does have his own books to write), there wasn't really a good place in Memory of Light to split it. It basically starts with The Last Battle and it's just the 900 page climax to a thousands-of-pages-long story. There are no dull moments.<br /><br />I've read complaints that the writing was, \\"Too Sanderson\\" and not enough Jordan.<br /><br />Well duh. Seriously, of course it is. Sanderson is writing it. And I thank him for it, because I don't know of another fantasy writer currently producing that could have tackled this challenge. I shudder to imagine the pile of notes he must have waded through, the all day meetings with Team Jordan, the endless tweaks and rewrites as he tried to match Jordan's tone and nuance. And the remarkable thing is, he did. In most scenes, Sanderson does fade into the background and you don't even realize Jordan himself isn't finishing the series. There are a couple of touches Brandon added, but he just did the impossible, let the man write his name in the concrete.<br /><br />The book itself gets a solid four stars. The pacing could have been better, and there are a couple of events that stink of deus ex machina, but they are handled well enough to not disrupt things too badly.<br /><br />For existing at all, the bookgets all of the stars. All five and more if I had them. Anyone reading these reviews, if you haven't started the series, don't let anything anyone says about this book convince you not to. Most of us have 20 years of expectations; that's a high bar for any author.<br /><br />Start this series. Finish this series (now that it's possible.)<br /><br />There may be neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of The Wheel of Time, but this series, at least, does have both.

B004MYF4SS|5.0|A compelling and complex tale of love hate and redemption, set on the northern most  inhabited Outer Hebride island, the Isle of Lewis. The author has done meticulous research into the life and culture of the island and the book becomes not only a crime novel but a wonderful cultural geography lesson. Beautifully written, with compelling characters and offering glimpses into a disappearing way of life. One of my favorite reads of the last year!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A captivating story that's very hard to put down. I haven't read any of her other books yet but I love Suzanne Collins' writing style in The Hunger Games. The characters have enough depth to insure that the reader stays interested. The perfect mixture of love, sorrow and sacrifice without compromising on the violent details....what more would you want from a book

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great. I love to play it, and I would definitely get it if I were you. I love it!!
B005IQZB14|4.0|I like how honest Cheryl came across in this book. How she is flawed and imperfect and didn't know what the hell she was doing hiking the trail. She makes no excuses for herself and really feels genuine in her real life account. It felt like having a glass of wine with an old friend. My bookclub really enjoyed it.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I like the quietness of the album.. I like that she sings with Donny Osmond.  It is a very nice mix
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book was amazing - I have read it twice already and plan to read it again.  This biography was a no holes barred depiction of a tough but brilliant man.

B0032VYHY4|5.0|This is one of the better Universal Soldier productions yet.  It was filled with action from start to finish.  Great fight scenes. I recommend this video for the die-hard action film lovers.
1439152802|5.0|WOW!  This book was outstanding and I highly recommend it!  I loved the historical fiction, drama, twists and turns, and of course, the ending!!!!  I can't wait to discuss it with our book club.  Definitely one of the better books I've read in awhile.  I have never read any of Kate Morton's books before but I can't wait to read the other 3.  Thumbs up!

B004J64QSI|5.0|emotional, sad but glad, strong music, good story line, even Javert had a heart, the technical sound controller did not allow the huge chorus to drown out the stage singers, the arrival of the original cast at the conclusion was exciting

B000FC1MM8|3.0|.  To wordy at times in areas that did not require all the verbage. Story line some times got vauge.
B006RXPTNM|5.0|This is so much deeper than just another movie about a pedophile priest.  The psychology behind this movie goes deep.  I had to watch it three times!
B002QW7ALM|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie. Reviews were vague. I tried it because it was cheap. I liked it okay. A buddy of mine who normally doesn't get into sci-fi borrowed it and loved it. So, it isn't your average &#34;hey-I-like-this-kind-of-movie-so-this-one-must-be-good-too&#34;, but if you want something truly different, give it a chance.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another very strong story involving Mitch Rapp's dogged pursuit to neutralize evil on the earth.  Fast-paced, exciting, believable, and entertaining story which made for hours of enjoyment.  Excellent read for those interested in evil, terror and an American hero fighting back.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I wanted and automatic watch - no winding - no frills - easy to read - and so far I love this watch<br /><br />Maybe something in the back of mind says I have to wear it to keep it going but I haven't had it off since it arrived but to sleep or shower -<br /><br />Don't even notice its on and the time keeping has been fine<br /><br />No problems and I recommend the watch to anyone who notices it

B004QZ9P6K|5.0|It's amazing what the people of one small country surrounded by enemies have accomplished.  The are so far ahead of everyone else in so many fields.  This book is a MUST READ.  It reads quickly and there are times when you almost think you're reading fiction.  The Israelis are truly an amazing people.  It might not hurt the U.S.to adopt their system of spending 2 years in the army and how the selection process works for the various sections of their armed services.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The app came preloaded on my d2 pad (ice cream sandwich) tablet.  I decided to use it and the downloading part worked fine. However, when I went to open the book, there was only white screen with no text other than chapter heading and page number.  No menu button, nothing. It was a children's book so memory should not have been an issue. I thought perhaps it needed updating so went in and updated it, but still no success. The books I download show up, but then there is no text to read when I open it. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app thinking perhaps it was corrupted, but to no avail. The same problem remained. Please help. Is there anything more I can do, as I am very frustrated over this matter. Please email me a response back if there is anything I can do.  Or call, my phone number is 501 413 1373.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the story very much. Interesting characters I liked the strong female character. I was surprised by the twists and turns.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I found this book full of classical novel references.  From \\"1984\\" with its Big Brother overtones to a \\"Lord of the Flies\\" feeling.
0553801503|3.0|Ok. I really didn't find anything wrong with the book until I got to the final chapter \\"Meanwhile, Back on the Wall.\\"<br />What was George R. R. Martin thinking? No author worth his quill EVER mocks the reader directly. Now, in Book 2, \\"Clash of Swords,\\" the warning in the foreword is forgivable because the writing style is very unusual and can easily lead to confusion, frustration, and misunderstandings, but treating the reader like an abject idiot especially after the Detroit Free Press specifically states \\"a fantasy series for hip, smart people\\" is a naked insult! YES, we noticed that several of the characters did not have a role this time around. Furthermore, we also noticed that the \\"all the story\\" is still unfinished. For Example, while I greatly appreciate a certain \\"queen of whores\\" finding herself victim to her own machinations, her story still leaves me wondering what happens next because both she and her intended victim are currently facing death. I do not see how anyone can consider that \\"all the story.\\" Now, I may be just an amateur, but what I'm seeing here is that Mr. Martin either does not have the time (facing publishing deadlines perhaps) or the patience to stop and consider his character's plot development so instead, he just jumps to another character and works on that plot while waiting for his muse to speak to him. When the plot is simple, like at the very beginning of \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" this is not an issue. When the plot starts getting complicated, with numerous events happening at once, or close to it, juggling the plot like this causes problems. For example, I noticed a \\"Samwell\\" chapter where a girl selling oysters tells Samwell \\"you owe Xho a bunch of feathers,\\" but later, in \\"The Cat of the Canals,\\" the same girl wishes she had been there when Samwell (the fat one) got in the fight that got him thrown in the canal... huh? If she wasn't there, how could she have served as an interpreter? Telepathy?<br /><br />Frankly, it just seems to me that Mr. Martin simply was just so busy juggling that suddenly he realized he ran out of pages and went \\"Oh NUTS! I need to stop now. I'd better make up an excuse!\\"<br /><br />Mr. Martin, may I recommend using a storyboard from now on? Or perhaps stop juggling plots and write the character's POV to completion before moving on to the next character? After reading the reviews on the next book, \\"A dance of Dragons\\" I'm seeing some of those plots fall to the floor and shatter to pieces and then you trying to scoop them up and super-glue them back together telling us that you intended to do that.<br /><br />While I'm quite anxious to learn what happens next to Arya, Cersei, Samwell, and some others, I'm not eager to go buy any more books from this series until either Mr. Martin refines his style a bit better or the final book of the series is written so I can read comfortably without worrying about the author making any more \\"I don't want to do any 'to be continued' story\\" excuses.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|have to have it on my kindle  I think it's ridiculous to have to write a certain amount of word
0316228532|5.0|I read too many negative reviews before I bought the book. I bought it anyway and good that I did. But there are some points to take before you buy the book:<br />1. this is not a kids book<br />2. those who grow up with HP books are all grown up (me included) and living in the real world<br />3. this is not a book about magic<br />4. It's clearly a Rowling book. characters are rich, complex and there is depth to them<br />5. this book is about the cold bitter reality of life so if you are looking for a light read after a long day office, don't waste your time.<br />6. it is easy to forget that Rowling would be familiar with low income people's life and struggles , but she was one them before her successful books and movies.<br />7. story is layered and unfolds through out the book.<br />8. story is not written to American taste. Americans are used to Hollywood version of life, looking for hope in every situation, but reality is not a Hollywood story and happily ever after is a lie.<br />9. this is a British novel. it's cloudy, it's damp and it creeps into your soul! it is heavy like a kidney pie yet enjoyable like a cup of English tea.<br />10. if you love Rowling's writing and words this is a book for you.<br />I bought both the hardcover and the audiobook.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|As a single Mother with a son this really spoke to me. At first I was so mad at the Mom then I began to rethink since it was from the view of the teenage son. Yes, she, being the parent, was responsible to get their relationship on track but at some point we all have to take responsibility for our own lives. I think this would be a very good read for Moms and Dads who are struggling with their parent/child relationships.
B008OTTRXU|4.0|I am a baby boomer and found this an easy CD to listen to. I am not afraid to admit as a 55+ something I love 21st century pop.Catchy rhythms simple lyrics danceable too. &#34; Call me Maybe&#34; my pop single of 2012..cool sounds CarlyRae....:-)...

B000AADYYO|5.0|This album is essential to any Opeth fans, and I would recommend it as a decent starting place for new listeners. &#34;The Ghost of Perdition&#34; is certainly one of the best metal tracks of all time, and you needn't take my word for it. This record was nominated for a Swedish Grammy.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Walt Longmire is one of the best characters I've ever read about. Craig jumps out of the gate strong with this first in the series. Read this and you will not be sorry.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Dredd(released Sept/12)stars Karl Urban as Judge Dredd,Olivia Thirlby as Anderson,and others.Those of you who saw the original with Mr.Stallone in the lead,will find this one a bit more to the point and closer to the comic book series.It is far darker than Stallone's version and far more violent.The director had a thing for slo-mo here and seemed to enjoy showing bullets rip through flesh,blood spurting everywhere and bodies hitting pavement,in that mode.It is certainly not for the squeamish and it seemed like he was making a gory point once but continuing to beat your heads with it all through the movie.I like both versions as they are like brothers with the same parents,but I think Stallone's comes in respectively ahead of this one.<br />The story finds the post apocalyptic world now living in mega cities.Giant 200 or more storied apartment complexes are THE preferred places to live.The world also has a new style police force in which judges roam the streets and dispense justice,on the spot.Dredd is the most well known and storied of all the judges,and he has to accompany a rookie judge about the city and mark her as to whether she is future judge material or not.She scored four points below a pass at the academy,but her enhanced psychic abilities seem to make her an asset to the force.<br />They attend a call to a 200 story high living complex which is controlled by a drug dealer by the nickname MaMa.She was a former model until a pimp she worked for wrecked her face and she went into illegal business for herself.She controls the entire building and it contains a home making drug lab which dispenses the newest in drugs,the latest being a substance,when inhaled,seems to slow down time to a micro-second when inhaled(everytime there is even the slightest hint of this drug being used,the director will use the slo-mo to \\"enhance\\" the feeling).Dredd and Anderson come upon a grisly scene in the atrium area where three flesh stripped bodies have been thrown down and lay on display for all to see.<br />A local fills them in on what is going down and they head to an upper floor where they arrest one of the men responsible for taking the skin off the dead men.They attempt to leave but MaMa and her minions seal the building in,using old blast shields and doors.Now Dredd and Anderson have a prisoner with no where to go.For the next few hours the pair have some up and down encounters with MaMa and her troops,just barely escaping death.Eventually more judges show up outside and get in.Instead of assisting Dredd they are there to assist MaMa who has them on their payroll.Now Dredd and Anderson are forced to battle,not only MaMa's crowd,but dirty cops also.<br />Little by little the dirty cops are taken care of and MaMa's time gets shorter and shorter.Eventually Dredd confronts her on her top floor.However,she has a remote control device that is rigged to go off if her heart stops beating.This doesn't stop Dredd who first wounds her,sentences her,gives her some of her own drugs and finally sends her crashing through glass and down onto the atrium floor like the others.The remote device goes off but the signal is too weak to set off 50 stories worth of explosive charges.In the end Anderson passes her grade test.<br />Dredd is played by one of my favourite actors,who was first introduced to me via the TV show Xena.You may recall Karl wonderfully playing Caesar,with a bit of a bent to that charcater.He has since then appeared in a myriad of films,like one of the Riddick's,Doom,just to mention two off the top.Karl is a great actor with a great future ahead of him.Here he plays the comic book Dredd to a tee,ruthless with no remorse.I did find his emoting struck me a little funny,as he seemed to be channeling Clint Eastwood at times,doing a decent Dirty Harry impression.Other than that Karl was THE main character here,and when he wasn't around,the action I found lagged a bit.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include about six featurettes,a comic book prequel and commentary.<br />All in all a not too bad remake of the original starring Mr.Stallone.The producers I'm sure would say it's not a remake but a companion piece to Stallone's,but a rose by any other name,as Shakespeare would say.Urban does a pretty good Clint Eastwood impression with what little lines he is given to say throughout,but he turns out to be the centrepiece of the film.If the director had not made so much use of slo-mo,which got too gory and tiring,I might have given this film more marks.Recommended.3 1/2-4 stars.lear and crisp.Extras include about six featurettes,a comic book prequel and commentary.<br />All in all a not too bad remake

B002ZG97EC|5.0|Ah, Steve Carell.  You are a funny man.  And he does a great job doing the voice of Gru.<br /><br />This movie is a lot more than the sum of its parts.  The plot isn't anything particularly special, nor is the movie the most creative story I've ever heard.  However, when you put the individual pieces together (the funny sidekicks, the voice performances, the cute kids, and the whimsical personalities) it turns into a very enjoyable movie.<br /><br />I'm not really one for special features or anything, so I can't review those.  But I do love the dvd/bluray/digital copy packs, and I got this for under $10 as a lightning deal, and it was worth every penny.

0765325950|3.0|How long have we all waited for this, the final book of the WOT series?  I've been reading these books since junior high, and I've long felt that it was time to be done.<br /><br />First off, Brandon Sanderson has done a great job finishing off this series.  During The Gathering Storm there were a few parts where I felt my hair standing on end.  Towers of Midnight wrapped up a number of sub-plots in a satisfying way, particularly the plight of Moiraine.  But A Memory of Light...<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that the book was fine.  It wrapped up the series and it wasn't embarassing.  However, it was disappointing.<br /><br />First off, to me it felt like the entire series collapsed under its own weight.  There was so much to do in this last book, so many conclusions being made, so many characters to address, that it could only be done in something of a slap-dash fashion.  SPOILER ALERT! (sort of)  Several characters meet their end in this book, but Sanderson didn't have the time to do justice to their deaths.  Two [linked] characters in particular come to mind for me, and it felt like Sanderson just killed them off without leaving the reader time for any sorrow.  To wrap up this paragraph, even though most of the book consists of one huge battle, so much happens so quickly that things are simply accomplished rather than satisfyingly concluded.<br /><br />My second major criticism of this book is that I didn't find the battle between &#34;good&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; to be particularly compelling.  At the end of the day, the strength the characters of the hero and the villain are linked.  The hero is only as good as the villain is bad, and the villain is only as bad as the hero is good.  In the Gathering Storm and Towers of Midnight, Rand appeared to be a strong hero, and the Dark One appeared to be a strong villain.  The Dark One's evil was strongly portrayed as Rand slips further and further away from the light, particularly in the scene with the domination band, Rand, Min, and Semirhage.  In a Memory of Light, Rand's goodness is strongly portrayed as he becomes so firmly opposed to the work of the Dark One in the world that the world begins to be reborn around him.  However, to my mind it all falls apart in A Memory of Light.  SPOILER ALERT (again, sort of) Rand remains firmly opposed to the Dark One, but reaches the conclusion (essentially) that good is only good when evil is also a necessary option.  In other words, if you kill the Dark One, the world becomes a shallow and somewhat meaningless place because you have taken away the power of choice between good and evil.  Now we enter into a philosophical/theological discussion in which good and reasonable people may disagree.  I, for one, disagree with Jordan's/Sanderson's(?) view of the world.  It seems to me that good is not reliant on evil to be truly good - it seems possible to imagine a society in which evil is neither a possibility or a choice, and yet that society could still be truly good and meaningful.  So for me, the central conflict in the story falls apart at its very climax.  Evil is not to be tolerated so that our power of choice thereby makes us truly good, evil is to be resisted at every turn, and destroyed whenever good has the power to do so (which, if I may anticipate an objection, is not the same as killing everyone who does evil).<br /><br />Now many people may not care about the underlying philosophy in the book.  That's okay.  However, Jordan/Sanderson go to great pains to develop this philosophy (in the ongoing dialogue between Rand and the Dark One), so it seems fair to me to critique it.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope that if you read the book you enjoy every moment of it.  I did enjoy certain parts of it, but overall I found it disappointing.  That made me sad.

B007SGM084|2.0|I bought this because so many of my friends who are not regular readers were reading and raving about it.  After the first few sex scenes it's kind of all the same. I'm not even sure of what the characters look like or if they have real personalities. I only finished reading it because I don't not finish books, but I was actually falling asleep while reading it by the beginning of the second book. It reminds me of those dime dozen Harlequin novels I read in my early teens, but with more graphic sex.  If you actually like to read to READ and get into the characters, don't bother with this. If you like lots of sex, subscribe to some porn for more interesting stories.

B0090SI4HO|4.0|He said he'll be back, and whether you took it as a promise or a threat, here he is honoring that remark. After a decade of modest obscurity - Where in the world did he go? Was it some missionary work in India? - Arnold Schwarzenegger, 65 years old and perhaps reeking of Preparation H - roars back to action cinema. He's greyer now and his pecs don't quite have that old flex and form, but it's still Arnold, him what we action buffs loved back in the '80s. I guess absence does make the heart grow fonder. Let's face it, folks like the Rock and Vin Diesel just weren't holding it down. No one is quite as large as life as Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />Them powers-that-be, and this includes Arnold, are smart to acknowledge our guy's age. THE LAST STAND is generously peppered with snide remarks about how over-the-hill his character is. And since his age is addressed, we can ease back on bagging on how unconvincing this venture is. Arnold plays grumpy Sheriff Ray Owens, once a Los Angeles narcotics officer until he sought a more peaceful living in the sleepy border town of Sommerton Junction, Arizona. But Owens' \\"retirement\\" gig heats up when word reaches him that sadistic cartel boss Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) has escaped federal custody and means to cross the border into Mexico. And Cortez may be heading his way. Owens' old instincts are triggered when he notices a suspicious crew of out-of-town truckers lazing about. His instincts don't play him false. These \\"truckers\\" are hard-core mercenaries set to rendezvous with Cortez. Man, if only there were a monster gatling gun in the house or something.<br /><br />And there is. One of the boons of this film is its entertaining supporting cast, one of which is Johnny Knoxville. He plays the local kook who runs the firearms museum and who gets some of the best lines and delivers onto the Sheriff a hellacious Vickers Gatling Gun. Knoxville, along with Luis Guzm&aacute;n (irascible), Jaimie Alexander (cute and feisty), and Rodrigo Santoro (not cute at all and boozy), comprise Schwarzenegger's outgunned deputies. They tend to counterbalance Schwarzenegger's rustiness and creakiness. Give the Arnold a break. It's been a long minute since he'd starred in one of these.<br /><br />THE LAST STAND, treating us with a solid \\"R\\" rating, is Schwarzenegger at his most vintage. The film likens itself to past action hits that may have been less ambitious but were still massively entertaining (RAW DEAL, COMMANDO, READ HEAT, THE RUNNING MAN). There's a sense of campiness. The plot is wafer thin. Still, you're advised to be generous with the genre tropes and the inevitable plot holes. Despite that discouraging trailer, there's much to like onscreen. This is acclaimed Korean director Kim Jee-Woon's first English speaking film, except he doesn't allow that to hamper his style. He invigorates most every scene with vitality and a comic touch. He prevents the material from collapsing.<br /><br />There's a strong element of the Western, a whiff of oaters like EL DORADO and such. While the first half of THE LAST STAND is mostly set-up, the second half is an explosive, crowd-pleasing, action fiend's dream. Not that he has a choice, but I appreciate that Schwarzenegger sticks to what he does best: firing big guns, occasionally bestowing a wicked suplex on a fella, and dropping a deadpan one-liner or two. As always, Arnold indulges in a bit of self-aware humor. You don't see Arnold doing wire-fu. That would be a travesty. Schwarzenegger, looking fairly fit and spry (even his wrinkles have muscles), reportedly did as many stunts as he could. I guess the restful missionary work in India was good for recovery time from his exertions in past action thrillers.<br /><br />So it seems that he's back to stay, and I'm glad. I enjoyed myself silly watching THE LAST STAND. I don't know how much of my enjoyment was derived from nostalgia. Maybe later Schwarzenegger pictures of this ilk will end up boring the crap out of me. Butnot for a while. I'm looking forward to his upcoming projects: his team-up with Stallone in the prison break thriller, THE TOMB (2013), and most especially his reprise of Conan the Barbarian, THE LEGEND OF CONAN (2014). I'm a bit leery of TRIPLETS, his sequel to TWINS.not for a while.

1607066017|5.0|SAGA is so bloody tremendous I wanted to take my time dropping a review, have it be all thoughtful and such. But then I realized I better get a move on before everyone else bogarts the best adjectives. So this is my move on. I don't believe I exaggerate when I say that SAGA is practically perfect. SAGA unintentionally puts down most of its contemporaries. It lays waste to 'em, unwittingly. Reading a Brian K. Vaughan joint - and welcome back, dude! - and ogling Fiona Staples' ridiculously gorgeous artwork, it makes me mad because I'm struck all over again with how many crap comics are out there in comparison (I'm looking at you, GREEN ARROW, JLI, HAWK & DOVE, and bunch of others). Sometimes you forget about what's bad until you read something what's as good as SAGA. I'm sorry, FABLES and the new HAWKEYE series, you've both got to sidle over.<br /><br />I'll try not to indulge in too much detail. It'd be criminal to spoiler things for you, plot-wise and even character-wise. Suffice this: As already mentioned elsewhere and ad nauseam, there are elements of STAR WARS and of ROMEO & JULIET here, but within that context SAGA is a daring and original masterpiece, a grand undertaking. It seamlessly melds science-fiction and fantasy. The narrative concerns star-crossed lovers Alana and Marko, two soldiers from opposing sides of an ongoing galactic war. He was a prisoner-of-war. She was a prison guard. And then they ran away together. On the armpit planet called Cleave, Alana and Marko and their baby girl desperately try to slip by enemy forces. A generous bounty placed on their heads attract the most dangerous bounty hunters in the universe. Oh, and the baby narrates the story.<br /><br />SAGA reeks of freshness and originality. Vaughan is so very good, and this may be his best stuff yet, and, mind you, I've read Y: THE LAST MAN, EX-MACHINA, and THE RUNAWAYS. It's such smart writing in SAGA, and so funny and subversive and thought-provoking and, yes, sometimes graphic. Seems as if there's a \\"What the f--!?\\" moment every few pages of each issue, whether it's a plot twist or some startling imagery. A tv-headed robot sits on the toilet reading a romance novel, and this isn't even the most eyebrow-raising thing that this robot has does on page. I love the interactions between our two leads. Alana and Marko are wonderfully fleshed-out. They come off as real characters. Meanwhile, Vaughan loves to dabble in gray areas. Even the projected big bads, Prince Robot IV and the bounty hunter called The Will are fascinating people and aren't depicted as straight-up evil. In this galaxy-spanning conflict it's too early yet to tell the virtuous from the a-h0le. But they're all coming for our scampering couple.<br /><br />If you're poking around for something deeper, then mull over the evolution and ramifications of this war. Alana is from Landfall, the largest planet in the galaxy. Marko is a native of Landfall's sole orbiting satellite, the moon Wreath. Because direct conflict between Landfall and Wreath would result in absolute annihilation, each side has outsourced the actual combat to other worlds. This has the effect of Landfall and Wreath's respective idealogies and belief systems subverting countless other alien cultures. So the irony is that while the war is being relentlessly waged by other worlds on their behalf, Landfall and Wreath themselves exist in a state of peace. How's that for buggering your brain?<br /><br />If one's name determines one's vocation, Fiona Staples would be some indie singer in a smoky cafe. Instead she's killing it with her striking artwork. I don't know how much input she has in SAGA's meticulous world-building, but she brilliantly realizes Vaughan's concepts on page. This sort of story could very easily spiral towards a gritty tone. Staples applies sure and sharp strokes to define her characters, and yet her background scenes are rendered thru loose and subdued washes. This juxtaposition tends to lend a softer edge.SAGA's world looks both brutal and beautiful.<br /><br />Image Comics is on a wicked roll right now (check out CHEW, REVIVAL, HELL YEAH!, HOAX HUNTERS, WALKING DEAD). SAGA tops all of those other titles, that's how much I'm awed by it. If you're antsy for a sweeping, sprawling space opera fraught with consistently impressive writing and exquisite artwork, SAGA is your huckleberry. It hits not one false note. It manages to be both epic and deeply personal, exotic on a bizarre scale and yet so very human. What are you waiting for?SAGA's world looks both brutal and beautiful.<br /><br />Image Comics is on a wicked roll right now (check out CHEW, REVIVAL, HELL YEAH!, HOAX HUNTERS, WALKING DEAD).

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|An amazingly different kind of book for tweens and teens.  Interesting and uplifting without preachiness.  A remarkable story of family, friendship and courage.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a great game I love it the best I read all of the reviews people write so don't listen to other pellet this game is great
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|A nice read with a happy ending; but I couldn't face the tormented bits in the middle. I had to skip whole chunks because it was too traumatic. It IS pastoral and the reader DOES feel as if you've been transported to rural Ireland.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really wasn't interested in reading the Hunger Games, but my niece said she really thought I would like it, so I decided to try it.  I was only a few pages into the book, when I realized I didn't want to put it down, and that I would rent the movie as soon as I finished the book.<br />I loved the writing by Suzanne Collins and the world she transported me to.  I would recommend this book to anyone of any age.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This one harder to follow than most of hers but I still enjoyed the characters.  I could have done with less personal problems though and more investigation.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I really like the Jack Ryan series of book.  They are very timely with the issues of the day. Tom Clancy knows how to  weave current events and future events into a spellbinding story.

0765325950|5.0|The Wheel of Time is finished, and the final book was pretty good.  It isn't as good as the first 5, but was better than rest of the books.  Overall the series is good, the series probably could(should) have been shortened to about 10 books and it would have been just fine.  While the book jumped around alot between characters, it did seem to follow a consistent time line, though a near 200 page chapter was a bit annoying.  The other thing was that it focused on the main characters.  A lot of Rand, Mat, and Perrin plus Elayne, Egwene, Lan, and Min.  There were a few other bits involving other characters, but not too much.  The ending is appropriate and while I would have changed a couple bits it was good.  I would have also liked to have a bit more information in the epilouge, but not too much more.<br /><br />One problem, Sanderson invents a whole new culture for this last book - why?  But there are no characters or names to follow, but still they just popped out of nowhere to add strife.<br /><br />Comment about most of the one star reviews, most of which are protest reviews because there wasn't a digital version:  Hey Kindle users, remember back before Kindle was popular, back before 2005, we had to wait at least a full year for paperback books came out.  Yes, the publishers and writers want to make money, that is why they do this.<br /><br />Spoiler (written backwards to make it easier to avoid)<br />.esroh modnar emos fo daetsni aleb no ffo edor eh fi emosewa neeb evah dluow gnidne ehT  .deid ,koob tsrif eht morf eram yggahs eht ,aleb tub ,deid taht sretcarahc eht htiw enif saw I.

B001H1UQZU|5.0|Suspenseful. Scary to know that this actually happened and how many people can be so sick and twisted.  I live in Lincoln and visit Humboldt and Falls City all the time.
0765325950|4.0|It took me 6 days to get through this 900 page behemoth of a book, and that tells you how involved I was. The vast majority of the book is the Last Battle between the armies of the Dark One and the armies of the Light, and the action moves at a very quick pace throughout.  All of the story lines are wrapped up and tied together nicely by the end of the book, even a few that I thought were forgotten many books ago.<br /><br />This trilogy by Brian Sanderson to end the series has been the best reading I've had in a long while, especially after the long, annoying lull of books 7-11 when Jordan would repeat phrases over and over and make events take half a book when they could have been resolved in a few pages.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Very fun and addictive. I just created a very large base the covers almost all of the field given when you first play!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great way to end the trilogy.  I had trouble with book one--had to go back and reread.  After that I was hooked.

B0036EH3UC|5.0|I bougth this serie, and this package has all the chapters and related movies, beyond that is a geart serie and i enjoyed with all my family
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I thought the writers and producers stepped it up this season. The action in this is amazing. I loved the first and second season, but I think there was not enough action. In this you won't be let down. There is action around every corner.
B008458O3S|5.0|I have never played such a well-designed game. The game continues to get more complex, and I'm pretty impressed.<br />May I suggest changing the game's icon?
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game and play it from my desktop quite a bit.  There are several things about the Kindle version I like better but it is an abbreviated version of the game (not all the rooms are there yet) and the Tournament room won't load for me.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Insightful, compelling, captivating and a hard-driving, terrific movie. Penn and Watts were great, as was David Andrews who captured Scooter Libby in such a nuanced and uncanny performance.<br /><br />Every student in every high school civics class should see this movie, to be sure!!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I did enjoy Cloud Atlas the book but thought the movie was easier to follow.  The book did contain so much more detail than the movie but was difficult to follow.  I did love the character development in every chapter and would still recommend this book to everyone!
B00846REIS|5.0|Love it... .although it seems to much alike and closely to 50 shards of grey ...<br />.other that it's awesome.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|If you like zombie books you should really like this one. Told from points of views from all over the world Brooks paints a bleak and dismal picture of the dead attacking the living and the horrors of learning how to battle the onslaught of millions of zombies. This was an engrossing tale and a triumph of the human spirit.  I really can't wait to see the movie!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best series I have watched in quite a while. It is a refreshing change from the usual TV Reality shows that are such a disappointment.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very intriguing story with enough heart and feeling to keep you interested in the characters. A lot of military people will like this book also. This is not just for young adults to read.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Simplemente original, resistente al agua como lo dice, muy bonito el estilo nuevo lo recomiendo a los que nos jugastan los juegos con nuestras amistades !
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Fun YA fantasy adventure story which allowed for an enjoyable few days of light reading.  This is a coming of age story line where Thor, a slender 14 year old shepherd, dreams of joins the King's elite guard unit while living in the shadow of his brawny older brothers.  His brothers are successful in their recruitment to the King's Guard while Thor is passed over.  Thor is unable to accept a future as a shepherd so ventures forth in search of a different destiny.  Thor's destiny is key to the survival of the kingdom.  The pursuit of this destiny leads to an action-packed adventure as Thor recklessly and valiantly charges all obstacles in his way.  Conclusion was abrupt and a little too dangling for my tastes although I recognize that there will be more books in the series.  Setting is a traditional castles and magic medieval theme with enough innovation to set it apart from other stories.  This is not a story for anyone looking for another Lord of the Rings.  It is a good story for anyone looking for a fun, light, YA coming-of-age fantasy adventure story.<br /><br />A Quest of Heroes is the first book in The Sorcerer's Ring series.  Author has announced on his website that the second Book, [[ASIN:B00B47BM2S A March of Kings]], will be released in the next few days.  I could not find any information on intended length of this series.<br /><br />No major editing issues were noted.  A Quest of Heroes is 5,441 Kindle locations long.  Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range.  Longer novels can range from 15,000 to 20,000 plus Kindle locations.  Edit Jan 22, 2013:  Added link to book 2 which is available.

B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Every person I've talked to who has seen this loved it.  But, after I watched it I couldn't decide whether I hated it or liked it.  It definitely gave me a couple laughs, but I feel like I wasted a couple hours of my life.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have viewed all of the Downton Abby seasons. They are enjoyable to watch. But I was offended by the two men kissing. We know gays are a part of our lives but why throw these acts into our faces? Quality content is desired by the viewing public. I will continue to view Downtown Abby.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Or should I say getting my butt kicked?! 30 Day Shred definitely works, although I don't work out as much as I should. The DVD came quickly and I was completely satisfied.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because how life like the horse's are And the motion too.also I love how easy it's good for kids about5-12
B00969PR18|2.0|not that useful. without a gps in the tablet this is really a waste app,  if kindle had a gps it might be a very useful app
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|The film is all of those things.  Gruesome, for the violent scenes of killing, intense from the beginning to the end where everything starts to fall into place, and hilariously funny because of the stupid humor thrown in between like the Americans trying to speak and play Italian filmmakers.  It is definitely a Quentin Tarantino film so if you're uncomfortable with what he does this may not be for you but if you can get past the gruesome humor, this is a hit!  Christoph Waltz plays a great Nazi bad guy who is bad throughout and has you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
B0086700CM|4.0|graphics are great and it is an addicting game that requires a lot of eye hand coordination.  I have enjoyed it.
B000817YF0|5.0|This is one of the best records of all time. I was really excited to see that this was back in print, because I totally missed my opportunity to buy it the first time around. It came with all of the little add-ons as the original, including the smooshed penny. Can't get enough.
B00AKS656U|5.0|I love this game but the only thing that would make this game better is if my boyfriend would stop taking the game from Mr....lol
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Very enjoyable read. As a geek-child of the 80's it was nice to see a montage of all my favorite games, movies (John Hughes), and music wrapped in a life-like adventure game. Can easily see a world similar to this one in the future (OASIS and 3D-immersion). It broght back a lot of fond memories around games like Adventure and Zord.

1419705849|5.0|My 9 year son just keeps reading it over and over! This is by far his favorit series, as soon as he finishes it he just starts back over with book one. He still laughs at all the funny part
1439102813|5.0|This book hit home as my mother is dealing with memory loss and has been for the last 5 years. She does not have Alzheimers but what she does have has been undiagnosed.  Frustrating and very difficult for all parties involved - family, friends, and colleagues.  A lot of very painful pages in this book but also beautiful ones.
B006QPX7UI|3.0|4 hours and you just scratch the surface of the Battle. The book and movie are too talky and melodramatic. All that being said, watching the 50,000 Americans killed or severely injured in the space of 3 days is moving and horribly depressing. Told today technology and contemporary editing would bring the story to life in a better fashion.
B000007ODM|4.0|Similar to Lesium and Enigma....good complement. I like having the actual CD, easier than looking such music up on line, especially to just hear one or two selections.
B009D95IJM|3.0|I was excited to order this book. It had a couple really funs cartoons in it, but not enough to purchase the book.  I am the &#34;cat lady&#34;  - have 3 cats, foster kittens, work at a cat shelter.  Book is just SO-SO

B00003CXA6|5.0|\\"Gettysburg\\" is a wonderfully directed and produced movie taken from Michael Shaara's book, \\"The Killer Angels\\".  The screenplay is a marvelous adaptation of the book, leaving very little out, and using dialogue directly from the book.  The movie is long, at 256 minutes, but this is a historical epic film, and every one of those 256 minutes is meaningful and important.  The actors are superb in their respective roles, especially those of Gen. James Longstreet (Tom Berenger), General George Pickett (Stephen Lang) infamous for \\"Pickett's Charge\\", and Col. Joshua Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels). Martin Sheen plays General Robert E. Lee, the Confederate beloved General of the South.  Richard Jordan (as Brig. General Lewis Armistead) perhaps steals the show with two remarkably emotional scenes.  Frankly, I thought Martin Sheen was miscast as General Lee.  He does not portray the dignity and stately bearing of General Lee that I read about in Shaara's book.  I cannot help but think how much better Robert Duvall would have been in the same role (Duvall played a dignified Lee in \\"Lincoln\\").  This aside, the movie accurately portrays the Battle of Gettysburg, the most important battle of the Civil War, as it was a costly defeat for the South.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the director's effort to make the movie historically accurate.  The production spared no expense in creating the sets, depicting the uniforms, the implements of war, and the battles themselves.  This makes the viewer feel as though he is watching an actual historical event take place. (I did see a jet contrail in one scene however!).<br /><br />One criticism I have involves the music that plays during the war scenes. Rather than make the brutal close-up killing more realistic with the actual death cries of the wounded and dying, (like the opening scene in \\"Private Ryan\\") the gallant, heroic, and emotionally moving music overrides the scenes to such an extent that I quickly tired of it.  Men killing other men with cannon balls, musket balls, and bayonets is not heroic or inspiring in my view.  War is the bloody and brutal slaying of men, and I believe this particular music detracts from the horrific reality of war. There were over 50,000 casualties at Gettysburg.  This appalling number of dead and wounded occurred in just 3 days of battle.  While the musical score certainly enhances any movie, I believe it is misapplied to the movie's detriment in war scenes.<br /><br />This is certainly a 5-star movie.  It will not appeal to everyone, but to those with an interest in American history, this is a movie they will want to see.  I also heartily recommend the book previously mentioned [[ASIN:0307932885 The Killer Angels]], for a more complete understanding of the war and specifically, Gettysburg.<br /><br />koneannon balls, musket balls, and bayonets is not heroic or inspiring in my view.

This collection contains many heroes from the Marvel Universe, some very well known and some I am not too familiar with(I have dropped out of the comic loop from about the mid/late 90's so any characters created after that time i have no real knowledge on).  The somewhat equal character to Hulk was \\"the Sentry\\".  I have never heard of this character before and was surprise to find him to be equal with the Hulk in some stats/powers.  I am trying to keep from giving away too much info but my only problem with this story was not really knowing anything out the Sentry.<br /><br />The artwork was really clean and detailed and the writing was good.  If you are a fan of Hulk then you got to read this.
B0048FQ0HU|5.0|I like to be reminded to keep posotive and Rhonda Byrne has matered this skill.  Her soothing voice is a plus for listeners.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Okay - it's purple - so I knew I would love it! ha! But - it is exactly the accessory I needed to protect & carry my Kindle Fire!
B00846TRHY|4.0|This movie depicts what is going on in the world today.  Gerard Butler was a surprise in this movie.  He showed a soft side and a tough side, which he had to do get his mission done.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact that I have so many translations/versions in one spot. Still learning how to use it more effectively - but am truly excited about this product! I believe my son actually recommended this to me - he is such a brilliant young man! A great way to physically carry God's Word with me everywhere - so that by hearing & hearing the Word my faith gets stronger & stronger!!

B000669GAI|5.0|How can one not love this greatest hits CD?!  It really brings me back to some good times, and miss some of Pearl Jam's fun concerts.  If I could only turn back the clock and relive those moments.  Glad I can enjoy the great tunes!
B004XZR63M|5.0|Great book! I would highly recommend this to all adults, but mainly to our youth. This book would be great for college kids or teens that are highly motivated. Any child wanting to get a business degree. Very easy read and very motivational.  I absolutely loved the book. I currently own my own business as well. Enjoy!
B002IVLH60|2.0|I like Pearl Jam, but I think only about 3 songs on this CD are worth listening to.  Next time I'll just purchase the MP3s.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|Pink Floyd will always be one of the best bands ever! Came as a gift for my X-mas so great!
B005R32L66|5.0|I downloaded it to be able to comunicate with my sales force via my Android tablet. It works very similar to the version I use on my laptop, but the convnience of being able to pick up an go in the middle of the conversation and continue that conversation is very convenient and has boosted my productivity. It also makes keeping in touch with my wife and kids while on the road internationally far easier.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I'd seen and heard everything from the concert but on Blu ray plus he bonus material and interviews I was impressed. Absolutely killer on the surround sound. Highly recommended
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I find this game soothing. It would be nice if the coins refilled a bit faster when you're not playing, but the game itself works well and relaxes me. Nobody is more surprised than me that I play this game so often. :)
0345350499|5.0|I first read this back in 2000 and it's been a favorite of mine ever since. I bought this for a friend who I knew would love it. There is so much depth, I highly suggest it.

B006964E8S|5.0|Great reading from page one to the finish. John Puller would be able to take on Jack Reacher and give him a run for his money
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I play it more than I should...  But it certainly does keep me entertained if I'm bored or just want a distraction.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's is a pretty good game. It's e enough better if you've wanted your own horse. I'd suggest trying the game. It's worth it.

B002VQ7PVS|5.0|&#34;Restless&#34; is a rivetting book. I enjoyed it enormously. I couldn't wait to get back to reading it. I think Boyd did a great job of writing from a woman's point of view. I reread the last chapter to be sure I understood all the twists and turns. Thank you Mr. Boyd for a both an intriguing and fascinating book.

B007T9UIMA|5.0|Bought this for my daugther for Christmas, I fully expect it to be worn out by her birthday this summer. Perfect for the tween girl in your life.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Neat little game. I don't do games but this simple game has its interest and logic. Good for cruise mode or while watching TV.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|If you liked the movie, you will love the CD and listening to Gwyneth Paltrow!<br />The only disappointment is they have Anita Hill singing &#34;Give in to Me&#34; instead of the actors in the movie<br />which I think was much better.
B000001G8R|4.0|If you like Mendelssohn's Ouvertures, this is your album.  I got it for my wife, at her request, but she doesn't listen to it much.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Very realistic and great acting. I recommed this movie. Johnny Depp and  Penelope Cruz are really good together in this movie.

B005KDWUFA|5.0|We wen to there concert here in San Diego. Loved them before that, but after the concert wow love the sounds
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I will never look at a pinky promise the same way again. This was more than I expected, but in a good way. In a great way. It made me have faith in writing again.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were so perfect as a couple who had become so comfortable in their marriage but it wasn't a happy marriage.  It was good to see them trying to reignite the flame, although somewhat uncomfortably.  To quote others, &#34;I laughed, I cried&#34;, I took notes.<br />And let's not forget Jim Carell.  The man has talent!  Unlike with so many comedians who act, I did not expect to hear any &#34;schtick&#34; from him, just well acted lines.
0307887448|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my friend who works for the public library. She recommended it for my boyfriend as it is quite popular with men and gamers. I surprisingly enjoy it as well!
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|how can you go wrong with this movie.  its by far the best one in my opinion.  awsome how  well the actors played off each other.
1579128955|4.0|I love picking this book up and looking at the wonderful pictures.<br />Each Element brings with it it's own witty humor and interesting facts.<br />The author does well at explaining the structure of the periodic table.<br /><br />This type of book is one that might inspire someone to learn more about the elements as well as basic chemistry.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|if you like over the top action you have it here folks.  typical guy movie!!!  guns explosions and fights, you cant go wrong.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book, found it interesting and funny. Recommend it too young teens. Intermediate school level. H f duff x g
B0098VYCCE|3.0|the damn twilight actress was way over the top so it wasnt the greatest movie.  also kinda slow.  wont be bad once its free.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|not the best one but a very well done one.  the acting in this was up to par and the action scenes were intense
B004IHE2B4|4.0|I got a lego train recently and I purchased theses tracks for it to ride on but I was disappointed that there weren't enough flexible pieces to make a full circle. There were only enough to make a quarter circle
1781163243|4.0|I haven't personally played any Halo games since the first Halo and it's sequel Halo 2 on the original Xbox. But I've always liked the visuals of the games which is one of the reasons why I bought this book. The second reason is work related because I do concept design as a livinghood. While not exactly the same as concept art, there are enough similarities between the two to justify me buying the book.<br /><br />Now, I've read a lot of concept art books in recent years and I have to say that Awakening: The Art of Halo 4 is among one of the best out there. The love of the studio behind the new game really shows here. The new trilogy has given the makers freedom to turn a new leaf in the visuals of the Halo universe and still keeping it recognizable as Halo. Master Chief, Cortana, weapon and ship designs are an evolution lifted from the previous works while the new threat, the Forerunners, are presented as very alien and fresh take on the almost cosmic enemy.<br /><br />Now I haven't personally played the game so I can't tell well the concepts have translated to the actual game, but the book is a really good lesson in concept design and evolution of the franchise. Highly recommended, even if your not in the games themselves.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Really boring until the end when they are FINALLY together. Needs to be more substance in the middle of the book. Sad ending.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This movie never lags.<br />The actors have great chemistry and many of the lines had us laughing.<br />Historically interesting too.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The ending was unexpected. I Love the way the author ended with the letter from Jo. I would suggest the book to many.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Now I can read and sync my books between my plain vanilla Kindle and my new Galaxy Tab.  I still like the plain Kindle for &#34;pure&#34; reading, but like carrying the tablet on trips for it's wider versitility.  This app works perfectly.
B005HPMB6Y|5.0|Loved this book couldn't put it down!! Would definitely recommend this book!! Could read again and again!! Loved it so much
B00066FBQG|5.0|Paul Newman & Robert Redford are great in these two movies.  I'm introducing my youngest daughter to them because she's never seen either one.  And they are a MUST!
B009GEEMLY|4.0|This movie focuses on Tony Stark Also known as Iron man not giving that much attention to the other marvel super heros.
0792839730|5.0|This movie has is a great movie about WWII.  My great Uncle was played by Elliott Gould.  He was a Lt. General.  Anyone that likes war movies, this is one that you should see.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The phone case came faulty, I disliked the way it was packaged. Also, the main in convince was it broke after a few days with little to no usage. Very unsatisfied

B005OHSMBS|4.0|This book is simply amazing. I would recommend it to all dog lovers and scientists alike. Thoughts who like psychology and obtaining new interesting and humorously put insights on Mans best friend. I love this book, and it has made me rethink about my career path. It is perfect.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Didnt really like this book.  Found the sex scenes boring and the continuous emailing between the two main characters monotonous.
1845767055|5.0|I love it is a visual ecstasy, the illustrations are stunning. A fantastic journey  and inspiring. I hope arrive more editions
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I must have read this book 5 times already.  I just loved it.  The story kept me up all night reading.  I finished this book ,the first time I read it ,in a day! And, I have told all my friends about it.  Great read!!!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I watched this on vhs as a child but couldn't remember the name so I took a chance on buying this one and hoping it was the same movie...It was! I couldn't believe it. Now not only do I get to relive this memory and have a piece of history but I get to share it with my daughter as well. Great purchase!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I watched this with my family and we all found something to love. The music is great and crosses genres (perfect for 40-somethings and teens). My daughter is now trying to mimic the scene when one of the lead characters uses a cup as her instrument to sing her audition. Of course, don't expect deep, thought provoking messages. But you won't get childish, potty humor either. This movie and Silver Linings Playbook were my favorite &#34;romantic comedies&#34; of the year. Playbook is a little edgier with less tunes and just as enjoyable.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|What's there to say? The stock rear lens cap, but way better than the white plastic cup that comes with some of the cheaper lenses. Also attaches to the body cap which can be used to store small items while shooting (hot shoe cover, eyepiece, etc).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story line. Lots of suspense will not disappoint. Twists and turns that will continue to entertain you for a long time
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a series that will grab you and keep you wanting for more at the end of each episode.  Downton Abbey is so well produced and the acting is outstanding.  The story also gives one a look into the British class system and how it evolved after the First World War much to the chagrine of some of the priviledged class in the story.  Fascinating and so worthwhile.  I highly recommend the series.  Note: I watched the first two seasons on my Kindle for free as an Amazon Prime member as I just heard of the series over the holidays.  Another good reason to join Prime!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great story...confusing at times....the unusual names make it hard to follow until you get well into the story. Watching the mini series on HBO would have helped.
B00633W614|5.0|These ed the characters, the ones you aren't supposed to hate, and the setting and timeframe for the novels.  When I finished<br />the third book, I quickly looked in back to see when the last of the series would be published.  that is a sign of a good, well<br />written series of novels.  Hope the make a movie out of this series, would be a block-buster.
0786948523|5.0|This is a fantastic book and a must need for any decent campaign. Great lore, fantastic descriptions, and awesome art. I read it just for fun.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Not at what I expected... way better...tho i wish it kept going.... best book I have read in along time that explored something you don t normally ponder
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting is outstanding, all the different characters are well developed and well played.  I caught up to season 3 after watching all of season 1 & 2 on Amazon Prime, now I'm hooked!!!!

B008602KQI|4.0|I was glad to see aversion of the book that everyone can see. Not too much violent visals or to much bloood and guts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wonderful game for horse lovers. Very fun, I highly recommend this game. It's like you actually have a real horse to care for.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|This movie was quite the disappointment... even for a big Johnny Depp fan, it's just surprisingly boring and bad. Makes me sad!
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Iconclast is a great album from these prog-metal kings!! My favorites on the cd are End of Innnocence, Electric Messiah, and Dehumanized. There isn't a song on here I don't like, though.
0307960471|5.0|Harry Hole, Jo Nesbø's damaged hero comes back from retirement in order to help Oleg, the boy he helped raise--in a past that now that seems as distant to him as his own youth-- prove his innocence in a murder case.<br /><br />Phantom is the most appropriate title one could think for this novel. Hole is a phantom of his old self, and is haunted by his past, but he's also on the hunt for a man nobody seems to know much about.<br /><br />His return to Oslo from Hong Kong, where he has somehow managed to make a new beginning feels almost like an ordeal to him. He feels at a loss in his own city, a city whose streets and alleys, bars and underground dens knows like the back of his hand. I no longer belong here, he seems to think, and perhaps he's right.<br /><br />But how can you help someone who doesn't want your help? How can you get into places, find people, and ask questions, when you no longer carry a badge? Harry has no juice anymore, no power, and if it wasn't for an old colleague he'd feel as lonely as one could be in his native land. Even Rakel, his ex-lover and Oleg's mother, the woman who summoned him, doesn't seem to want to come in close contact with him.<br /><br />Despite all the obstacles though or from a sense of duty towards the former or love for the latter, he simply cannot get on a plane and fly back to the place he came from. So he checks-in in a rundown hotel and starts investigating. This case though will prove hard to crack, since more often than not he finds himself at a dead end; every answer he gets gives birth to new questions, and every clue he follows seems to lead him to yet another dark place, to yet another labyrinth.<br /><br />As the reader follows Harry through the darkness of the streets, he comes face to face with junkies and drug dealers, with cold-blooded killers and some desperate people; people like him. At times he feels like that he should give everything up and leave, but deep down he knows that he'd never do that. He loves Oleg, and so he'll keep on fighting for him, even though the boy of the past, the young man of today, doesn't really seem to like him anymore. Could he be hiding something from him? Did he actually kill the man he's accused of killing?<br /><br />He has to find the answers, no matter what, and he has to keep fighting with his personal demon; the one that keeps telling him to go to a bar and lose his self in oblivion. But he doesn't drink anymore, and he really shouldn't start again now. Not now, not quite yet.<br /><br />Jo Nesbø delivers another great yet bleak crime fiction novel that talks about the darkness that lurks in the hearts of men.Oleg, and so he'll keep on fighting for him, even though the boy of the past, the young man of today, doesn't really seem to like him anymore.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham novels and this one was in keeping with his usual level of legal drama and also provided a nice opinion on the Government.
B008QE9VJI|4.0|As always, Johnny Depp is immensely entertaining. His character kills a ton of people in this film, so it may not be a good flick for impressionable children.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|If you've seen the 2012 George Hopper film, you'll appreciate this CD. It does not have the deep stentorian tones of the Broadway cast album, but considering these performances were acted-live, this an impressive companion piece for fans of the film.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Very good read!  As good as previous books by Connelly. It is a step above earlier books by this author.  I recomend it to anyone who loves crime stories.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Good movie but I definitely do not think it was as good as the previous. It had a lot of crazy action but not much suspense. The last chase took up almost half the movie.
0735619670|5.0|This is one of those books that every developer should have in front of him all the time. Filled with really useful information on the best programming practices. This book will save you many headaches you may have while writing software.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This products was my gift in January, I love this. The Best sound for Playing MWF3 and Black Ops I or II.  I think that the programmable option is a great idea because i can download all sound from Turtle Beach Webpage.

B00632HWOG|5.0|Gee, I don't remember 'buying' my Yahoo.Mail which I have used since 1999 from Amazon, so what's up? Why am I reviewing it here?
B009CPES4I|4.0|enjoyed it.<br />I thought more time could have been devoted to the young couple and more about India and the people living there.
B00005NKK8|5.0|This is a great collection of some of the best songs ever recorded!  These songs are real music & none of the &#34;junk&#34; that's heard so much today. I can definitely recommend & would buy again!
B006OCM0G0|2.0|It would be nice for the makers to make this a fair game so that the people that are on the same level as you are can get the same items. I have worked very hard to get where I am at and everything everyone else has I don't because I play on a kindle fire hd. I didn't get the Christmas update either. It would be nice to have an update and the prices on everything not go up when I get close to saving enough coins. The amount of gems that are charged for certain items are ridiculous...this is a game not something to try and make millions off of.

B0086700CM|2.0|This is a fun game but not for me.  I would think that a teenager or young adult would really enjoy this.  Not for me.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I was interested in this product to see what it was.  I not sure that I could use this item at this time.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Now I have had a lot of fun with this Item.  Most everyone I have showed it to like it as well and we have lots of fun with it.<br />Good time had by all. Thanks !!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is use on a daily basis.  I like looking up different area's that I may be going to.  It is nice to be able to get updates on different area's as well as the local weather.  Don't always have a TV in front of you.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|I usually can't put a book down and read them in two or three days. This book took me ten days, but I was looking to take my time. It was my first read on an electronic device. I enjoyed the main character and the southern United States setting. It held me mildly captive. It was an easy read, but left me without a real feeling of justice served like other Grisham novels.
B0096HI226|5.0|channing tatum has grown up since &#34;the dilemma&#34;  very gorgeous, great acting and simple plotting. highly recommend for the ladies, but men too, to learn some moves.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this book but I thought it was ok. Not sure if I will read the others.
B0033807E0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I couldn't stop reading it. As the fourth instalment in the series, Rick Riordan has done great work on it and should be praised for his efforts. As all the Percy Jackson books have done, at the end of the Battle of The Labyrinth, some questions have been answered and some haven't. I cannot wait to read the next one!
B008KOTNVA|3.0|I purchased this the start of December 2012 and I've been using it multiple times a week since. The amount of bits that you receive is a great perk of this set which is what likely justifies the price, however the actual set itself leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />The case is made out of hard plastic and clicks to close. When you open it, you kind of have to pry it open, rather than just lift it away like the sliding or clamping cases. Every time I go to open or close this, which is typically accompanied by a loud \\"click,\\" it feels like I am going to break it. The top of the case has a small hole for hanging your set. It is a nice addition if you want to hang it, but a nuisance that adds unneeded bulk if you never plan to (which is my case).<br /><br />Inside of the case there is a thin plastic molding that holds your screwdriver, extension, flexible shaft, and your bits. This plastic molding is somewhat durable but still flexes some--it is also not glued or secured to the hard plastic case in any way. All the bits are in rubber holders of 6 that you are able to take out of the case. This is nice and convenient in some cases, but in others where you can only use one hand to remove a bit you're going to have some issues. The rubber grips the metal which makes it difficult to grab one quickly. (If you're working with one hand, it is also very difficult to open the case of this set.)<br /><br />The quality of the bits are decent, but I find that some of them do not get a good bite on the screw that you're removing. This happened quite a lot with the screws on my Dell M1210. With my other set, I grabbed one bit and used it throughout the entire screen replacement procedure. This set took three. However, the variety of bits that you get with this set is astonishing. If you're expecting to come in to contact with any of the screws that this bit can open-- definitely get this set. If you don't really plan to and only want it for basic computer repair, you'd probably have more luck the 30 piece Boxer set shown at [...]<br /><br />The stainless-steel (I believe) driver itself is a little too small for my liking, though I have larger hands. There are three small rubber o-rings to act as the grip. On my initial driver, one of these had already broken off when I received it in the mail. ifixit was quick to send me a new driver when I contacted them to figure out what size o-ring was needed to replace it. The design is very attractive, but in practice I often find myself having a hard time getting a good grip on the driver to apply enough torque to remove or install a screw. The o-rings also seem like they'll break in no time. The extension allows the driver to be used as a T handle driver which is a very nice addition, however having to resort to that so often has become a chore. I've also come to find out that the magnet in the driver is not as strong as the one in the extension, but it is still strong enough in most cases to pick up most screws if you have a steady hand. The flexible shaft is extremely useful, but on my particular set there is a point where it catches. I am not sure if this is a defect from my set, if I'm bending it too far, or if this is how it was designed, it is still very useful nevertheless.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend getting this set if you are sure to use the extra bits. However if you're planning to start out with simple repairs first, I'd go with a different precision set that has higher quality bits, a slightly larger driver, and a better case even if you have to sacrifice some of the bits. Later on down the road, I would recommend picking this or a comparable set up so that you can open anything. This does after all use the 4mm bits so you can use them (along with the shaft and extension) in a lot of precision drivers.

0316224588|5.0|It was through sheer luck that I came upon Rankin's new book.  I remember asking Ian Rankin, at a Book Talk, how long he felt he could write about Rebus.  His response was, \\"As long as he keeps talking to me. He hasn't yet revealed everything about himself.\\"  Well, five years ago I thought they weren't on speaking terms anymore.  Rebus is now working as a consultant for the  Edinburgh Police in a unit called, 'Serious Crime Review Unit\\" or SCRU.  This unit is looking at cold cases from 1966 to 2000 or so.  Naturally, something has to happen to bring the case alive.  Rebus bumps into a woman whose daughter has gone missing.  He begins to look into the situation and discovers, as the woman has suggested, that girls have been disappearing while on highway route A9.  I must state that I am biased as I have driven the A9 from Stirling through Pitlochry to Inverness, along the north coast and up to Thurso.  I have vacationed in Rosemarkie and watched the dolphins in the Moray Firth.<br />When Rebus gets his teeth into a case, he does not let go.  Old and new underworld characters Big Ger Cafferty, Frank Hammell and a young 18 year old named Darryl Christie are some of Rebus's sources of information.  Siobhan Clarke helps Rebus and their relationship continues to grow. This does not sit well with the Police complaints review group and they continue to pursue Rebus so they will be able to fire him or prevent him from returning as a regular member of the force.  Meanwhile, Rebus is poking his nose into anything and everything that might be connected to finding the A9 serial killer.  His old  investigating tactics and guile are still there and getting him trouble because the new police utilize technology to verify evidence, not their gut.<br />Reading this book is like finding an old friend and having a  long chat over a few malts at the Oxford Bar, in Edinburgh.  Let's hope that Rebus is able to return to the police force now that the age of retirement has been raised.  Keeptalking and listening Ian.
1400069289|3.0|It is what you except from a breezy business/science book, laboratory experiments and case studies intertwined into a story, alothough it is better than most books of this ilk.  It even has the familiar characters - get ready to draw new meaning from the marshmallow test and its decedents.<br /><br />There are three sections - Habit basics (The cue habit, reward cycle, how habits are replaced, not eliminated, and keystone habits), Organizational habits (truces), and societal habits.<br /><br />While the theory of habits is simple, application is hard - the book might not translate in breakthroughs in your life.  The habit is obvious; it is much harder to find the cue.  You have to correctly answer the question, \\"Why do I do what I do?\\"<br /><br />The concept of a \\"keystone\\" habit is alluring, but again is hard to implement.  Modestly successful people or companies may not be able to find the one habit that rewrites lots of other bad habits.  If you aren't self-sabotaging, one simple change may not change the trajectory of your life.<br /><br />Sometimes the point doesn't justify the story.  People and organizations use crisis to their advantage; crisis is an opportunity to rewrite the habit cycle.  Target is good at this, they target newly weds and expectant moms (50 pages to make this point).  Our behavior might not be the product of \\"free will\\" as much as it is a response to habits formed and reinforced by society.  People, rather being bad, evil, or lazy, may be responding to habits they want to, but are unable to break (another 50 pages of gambling and sleepwalking stories)
B004YXE438|4.0|This is a good deal for the money.  The puzzels can be configured to be more or less challenging, depending on your state of mind and how much effort you want to put into it.  You can also download your own pictures to create puzzels.

B005VPRETE|5.0|I bought my daughter a bunch of the LEGO Friends products for Christmas. This is by far her favorite! She loves the interaction in the tree house, a lot of things move and her imagination goes crazy. It was probably the most challenging set she put together, the only one she asked for help with, but in the end everything looks fine and she was very happy. That's all the matters!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Good application.  It does what it is supposed to do. I really like the really large snooze button. I have been using it several years and do like it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this! Good graphics and hidden items! The bonus part was fun too...would highly recommend it! I enjoy all the G5 games!
B0090X4GLW|2.0|First off, the songs on this cd are not the same versions as those from the movie.<br /><br />Second, this soundtrack is extremely short, under 30 min. If you're looking for expanded versions of the songs in the film, this isn't it. In many cases the songs are actually shorter than the ones in the movie<br /><br />Just not what I was looking for really.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I always enjoy Yanni's music. This is not the best CD he has made but it is still worth listening to.
B001RUXW48|5.0|very good movie about the c.i.a . lots of action and very good acting. i thought russell crowe was good but i thought leonardo dicaprio was great.the movie shows the c.i.a in action they are very brutel at times.it also shows how they can followyou how they can track you all over the world. i found that very interesting.i think you would really enjoy this movie.

B0085YNML2|5.0|Not a bad game, it hasn't &#34;hooked&#34; me and made me feel like I HAVE to finish it. But when I'm board I open this puppy up and play a couple levels, then continue on my day.<br /><br />Good distraction.<br /><br />( I primarily play it on my Nexus 7)
1572814136|5.0|This set is the closest I could find to the actual deck I used years ago.<br />It is very beautifully done and the price was great.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have to admit, this book is a page turner!  I found myself barely able to put it down at times.  I was not confused by the alternating POV and the plot twists-Awesome! All of the characters are fairly realistically drawn, even though you have difficulty liking most of them.  The pacing was good-frustrating but good and the psychology was intriguing on a many levels. I found myself staying up late, late trying to finish it last night. Then, today, as I reached the last pages-disappointment.  After getting so involved with these characters and investing time in the narrative, I'm sorry I recommended it to so many people. Yes, there are plenty of people who will like this ending and if it was classified as a horror story rather than a thriller, then the ending wouldn't be so...unsatisfying. There were so many different ways this could've ended and been much more satisfying-instead, it ended up feeling a bit rushed, contrived and just plain unbelievable-chilling, terrifying and scary, yes-but not believable. That's not to say that it doesn't leave you thinking about it after you are finished. It does, it's just not my idea of what I want in a book.<br /><br />A warning, quite a bit of colorful language (some very jarring and I'm no prude)as well as some very disturbing psychological aspects that may bother some people.
0425252868|5.0|This was a fantastic book about valor and honor.  A great insight into those who flew and fought in World War II.  I have already recommended it to many friends.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is fun and the graphics are good bit it takes too long to get gems to buy more horses.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm always cautious with new seasons but this one is starting out very strongly. I'd say it's better than the last two seasons already.
0375805613|5.0|This book brought me back to memories of my childhood, I loved Sesame Street and all things Grover. Adorable book, and my 10 month old son loves it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I couldn't put it down once I started. It was very well written and I plan on reading more books by this author. Money well spent.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|I rented this movie on demand and really loved it, so much so that I bought the DVD.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of horror movies and this is definitely more of a &#34;psychological thriller&#34;, I think. I thought Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne were great in their roles, and I was definitely creeped out for most of this movie.<br /><br />If you enjoy being scared, I think you'll like this flick.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|after a few problems I was able to finish the game! cant wait for the sequel! just beware of throw Runes-it can get tricky there
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|I had better expectation. The movie was somewhat slow. It lit up at the end with the final battle which was excellent. However before that it was very poor of content.
140123769X|5.0|New York Times bestselling author, Bill Willingham delivers another great adventure in the Fables series. It was expected that Snow White and Bigby Wolf's cubs would be given an important role within the community, and it was as if they grew up overnight. What was totally unexpected was the fact that the job came sooner than anticipated. Snow and Therese receive a surprise Christmas gift from an unknown sender, and this magical gift of a red plastic boat takes them on a journey to Toyland. Who was the secret admirer, and will Toyland be saved, or destroyed? What lesson will the cubs learn on this mission? The author creates a fun-filled, mystical fantasy that entertains throughout, the characters are unique, and the story is exciting. This delightful adventure with its colorful illustrations is fascinating as we enter the land of misfit toys. Enjoyable, and highly recommended!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is a great sience fiction movie despite the story is very simple there was a lot of action, no death/boring moments. I think this was somewhat better then the original one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book- couldn't put it down. was very emotional and intense- so if you're looking for happy go lucky this isn't it
B004X80QNG|5.0|I am a Kindle Fire user and I found this app to be incredibly useful. I had previously sync'd my Kindle with my Hotmail account including my contacts and calendar. Additionally I am not some OCD personality that needs to check on 2, 3 or 5 devices simultaneously to keep track of my schedule or to do lists. Yes, I keep a VERY full schedule, but this app lets me keep track of my schedule, task list, contacts, etc all on my Kindle (which is where I wanted it in the first place--makes it so easy for travel that way. My schedule is also always with me). To top it off, I am one of those people that love  to organize things in different colors. This app offers a vast array of colors for folder and category options. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the visual display of this program. Once you set category or folder colors, you can glace at the screen and know what is coming up without even reading details.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This is a great case that is completely water resistant. I even was able to text in the shower! Also it went through a lot of falls, but still my iphone was unscathed. My only complaint was that the air never fully left the inside of the case so the scrreen was hard to text on until I got used to it.
B009MFHFP2|5.0|This was recommended to me from amazon and I was a little skeptical as I've never heard music by Ben Harper. After previewing a few songs, I bought this MP3 album straight away and have loved it. Such serendipity to be offered recommendations that lead to music enrichment.<br /><br />Just about every song on this album is worth a listen and quite enjoyable. Mellow, relaxing and mood setting.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|wont play anything I have without crashing. it will load the screen with everything but then suddenly turn off each time.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|I love all of deadmau5's work. I was so excited for this release and it did not disappoint. Everything from Meowington's on the cover art to the actual songs made this a fun album for the deadmau5 fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the most awesome book I have ever read! I could not put this book down once I started it! I strongly recommend reading this book!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This was a great, feel-good movie- especially if you have some knowledge of baseball and the drafting process.  Eastwood was, as expected, masterful.  His supporting cast was great, too.  If you're a baseball fan or a Clint Eastwood fan, you'll enjoy!  This movie is right up there with Money Ball.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Love Grisham's work....story-line kept you turning the pages....interesting twists....some lack of development on the female character....not his best but certainly a 4 1/2 rating deserved.
1451695195|4.0|The book is wonderfully written and will give a tremendous amount of hope for people imprisioned by their anxiety to enter into their inner universe, heaven inside. From a spiritual and deep religious point of view and experience it needs to be clarified that our eternal life always proceeds beyond the existential phenomena of birth and death. Our process of dying begins already with our visible birth on earth. However, we must learn to approach the wonderful reality of life in each and every moment.After-Death experiences may happen, but any kind of an After-Life does not exist at all.<br /><br />Roland R.

B007N9FKCY|5.0|Love this game. Challenging, visually appealing, and the musician/s are truly talented. Lots of levels, plenty to do in each level. Reminds me of the games I played on Sega and Nintendo as a kid!
075669812X|5.0|As the title suggests, it gives information about every ninjago character. The best part is that it comes with the latest figurine of Lloyd.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This was an awesome movie.  Yes, it is violent, and yes it was a bit gory, but man it was a great ride.  I think Karl Urban really kept Dredd moving and even keeled, not driving the movie too far in the direction of campyness or in taking it's self too seriously.  Great special effects, very practical feel to them.  Lena Headey makes for a great villain.<br /><br />I hope there is a Dredd 2 and I hope they can keep to effectively straddling the line between camp and stodginess.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an amazing game for anyone who loves hoses and want to have the feel for it also you have a chance to play an amazing game

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I was intrigued by the movie ads and wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. It was great!
B00A0R42L6|4.0|not the best of the movies but it was pretty good. Dawn of the Dinosaur is my favorite but still good.

B003O86FMW|4.0|A trilogy is tough. Collins does a great job keeping the reader engaged but the story line isn't as strong as the first book. It's tough because there are more characters-and I don't pretend to have a solution-but the writing is solid and I can assure you I'm so happy I'm reading these back to back and I don't have to wait for book three!
1476712042|5.0|I spotted Beautiful Disaster at the shops and decided to get it as it has been featured on so many blogs that I thought I'd better see what the hype was about. So I purchased it and added it to my StS and Sunday Post. After so much peer pressure, I put off reading some other books and decided to get right into it! Well, I must say I wasn't disappointed, I really, really loved it.<br /><br />Abby catches Travis's eye at the conclusion of his fight in the very first chapter and it is obvious that this is going to be one hell of a ride!! Abby knows his reputation and tries to avoid him as much as possible and does her best to keep him at arm's length but he is very persistent!  They settle as being `just friends', although Travis sees there is something more to Abby and wants to pursue his feelings for her because she is not like any girl that he has met before.<br /><br />I liked Abby right from the start. She comes across as an innocent girl, but I think it a bit of a facade. She has set herself some goals and a bad boy is not what she wants. When she is coerced into going with her cousin to Travis's apartment she dresses in a t-shirt, sweatpants and flip-flops (trackies and thongs for us Aussies), wears glasses, no makeup and ties her hair into a messy bun. She does her best to try and repel him. When I was reading this I was already cracking up, but then Abby's cousin America takes one look at her and says,<br /><br /> \\"Why didn't you just roll in dog s*** and make this outfit complete?\\"<br /><br />Then I was in hysterics trying to imagine her looking like that!<br /><br />Travis... hmm...yum! What can I say, he's a hot, motorbike riding bad boy! He is a bit of a womaniser and fights in the circle to get himself through College. But he also has some secrets and Abby is the first girl to see behind the wall he has built around himself. And when that wall starts to crumble I fell more in love with him! He actually has some self esteem issues, but from his appearance you wouldn't think so.<br /><br />Abby's cousin America is dating Travis' best friend Shepley and they are both incredible people and offer support to Abby and Travis. America has been the only person that Abby has been able to confide in and knows all her darkest secrets. She helps Abby through a lot of issues throughout the book and it makes me happy that Abby still has someone to turn to. Shepley is basically Travis's manager when it comes to fighting in the circle and most likely the only person who knows how Travis thinks. He is able to set him back on track in most cases when he flips out. I liked both America and Shepley as they are a cute couple and they are both sweet. They give great depth to the story and it was entertaining to watch their relationship grow as well.<br /><br />Jamie McGuire takes us on a very emotional rollercoaster ride when she shares Abby and Travis's story. From the beginning they have amazing chemistry but boy do they have restraint!! There is no way I could keep Travis away for that long, I would've caved in long before Abby!!  Beautiful Disaster has an amazing plot, with a few twists thrown in when some secrets are unearthed. I would've read this book nonstop if I didn't have to get up in the morning to take the kids to school! I was enraptured by the writing and I was so absorbed into the book that my emotions were all over the place! I loved every moment of reading Beautiful Disaster and I can't wait to read Travis's POV in Walking Disaster when it comes out in April!America is dating Travis' best friend Shepley and they are both incredible people and offer support to Abby and Travis.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|Regardless of the changes these are by far the best and only star wars available on blu-ray. To not enjoy these for what they are is simply extremism. The changes made are few albeit regrettable changes, nonetheless, I am able to enjoy these epic movies in incredible detail and sound.<br /><br /> Don't be that guy. Do yourself and your family a favor - own these or continue to watch inferior DVDs with crap sound because you think Mr Lucas will hear you and the other 900 emotional fans on here.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Wow, does this book ever suck!!!!  I thought I was going to read a crime novel and I got a relationship novel about two loathesome human beings that are a waste of oxygen.  Reading  this ongoing self involved woman's thoughts made me think I'd like to murder her myself. Her husband is pretty disgusting on his own, the two of them make you wish humanity never crawled out of the swamps....
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|I have only played the first ten levels. Pretty simple yet engaging game. Will have to play further for better review
B0076L0S76|4.0|I really adore this film, the story and smart writing.  I thought Charlize Theron was magnificent as Mavis, but I also want to highlight Beth/Elizabeth Reaser's performance.  She is not just a passive good wife.  She is not just a nice ordinary person.  She is no pushover.  You see glimpses of how funny, quirky and smart she is, so you understand why Buddy/Patrick Wilson is mesmerized - and completely in love with her; he is following her lead.  Elizabeth Reaser's performance is just perfect - from her smiles welcoming Mavis, her enthusiasm playing the drums, and the hurt look on her face when Mavis/Charlize Theron bellows at her.  Beth is essential to the story, more than Buddy, and her performance reinforces Mavis's desperation and loss.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book also had you drawn in from the first page to the last. Can't wait to start the third book crossed. If you liked book 1 wait till you read book 2.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|The acrylic protector fits perfectly on my iPhone 4s.  It is somewhat grippy and soft to the touch, so the phone never slips out of my hand.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS BOOK AFTER READING &#34;THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO&#34;. BOTH BOOKS WERE FULL OF ACTION AND I DID NOT WANT TO PUT THEM DOWN. IT KEPT ME INTERESTED FROM START TO FINISH.I LIKED HOW THE SECOND BOOK CONTINUED IMMEDIATELY  FOLLOWING THE FIRST AND KEPT THE INTRIGUE.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I remember going to the cinema to go and watch this movie. I wasn't sure whether or not I would like it, but after watching it, it became one of my favourites! I honestly don't see how someone could rate this movie so poorly. Instead of listening to what others say, watch this movie first and then judge for yourself.<br />Other than that, great movie! Would love to see a sequel.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I LIKED THE BOOK BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE FIRST TWO. THE PACE AND PLOT WERE NOT AS FAST AS THE FIRST TWO BOOKS. IT WAS FULL OF A LOT OF DETAIL WHICH I DON'T LIKE. HOWEVER, SINCE I HAD READ THE FIRST TWO BOOKS AND REALLY LIKED THEM THE INTRIGUE WAS THERE TO CONTINUE READING TO FIND OUT HOW THE PLOT ENDED.
0553801473|5.0|I love this series almost as much as I love the Wheel of Time series.  Would be nice if the books would come out a bit faster but I would rather have quality than quantity so I can manage the wait :D
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This has multiple levels and is a lot of fun to play.  Good sounds and graphics. It is a game you can play over and over and never get tired of it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|The book was enjoying captivating fun  unique and inspiring I love ally condies books they are absolutely amazing I recommend them
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Obviously this is the new trending book, I thought it would be better. its not written as well as expected. However, it did keep my attention and was eager to finish the book. Which says a lot considering how little I read for pleasure. (no pun intended) :)
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|I didn't expect much from this film. In fact, I put off watching it for years, because of low expectations. So I was shocked how good it turned out to be. Hugh Grant is superb, probably his best performance ever. Julia Roberts plays her role oddly, with a certain remoteness: detached with an air that's almost condescending. The good news is that she sticks with this demeanor and makes it work for her as the forbidding celebrity looking for down-to-earth true love and willing to sacrifice for it. But the reason the film is superb is the screenplay. It's a very interesting, intricate, and excellently nuanced love story. Very realistic, believable, and in the end, satisfying. The story features much humor, some well done, but quite a bit that's downright poor. But this is a minor distraction, easy to overlook. In the end, I enjoyed this movie enough to buy the DVD after watching it on pay-per-view.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|For Indiana Jones fans, what can be better than a full set (to date) of the films? No complaints that I've heard from the recipient of this gift.
B009VB97EY|3.0|If you are only concerned about the eye candy in this movie, then you'll like it. Otherwise, it's very underwhelming both in story development and character development. Overall, not as fulfilling as you'd want from a lap dance.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you can pet play n ride yer horse in this wonderful free app no problems and great graphics. Love love love it.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I admit up front I am not a Kristen Stewart fan. But I like Charlize Theron so I wanted to give this movie a fare shot. It's visually beautiful but that's about the only nice thing I can say about the movie. Disappointing.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|its easy fast and it has different style chooses for your shelf and book covers you can have multiple books you can use them for school and your personal needs.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|But there were so many characters in this story that there was no time for character development. The Loki villain was great. And the reinterpretation of the Hulk was better than I expected. But these 3rd-world super heroes (Black Widow and the guy with the bow) just consumed valuable oxygen in the movie, which took the wind out of the sails for me.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Smooth & easy to use. Use it all the time, when at work or just around the house. Love the $5 albums.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This was a great movie to rent. The story was alright, but the actors are what made it worthwhile. Maggie Smith should be in every movie made.
0399156577|5.0|Nora Roberts always put out an thrilling book!<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who oves<br />to read.  Thank you
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The storyline and the acting moved very slowly. Visually this movie is amazing, but it all added up to lots of sizzle and very little steak.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is the new wave, this is how I keep in touch with friends and family on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|This movie was alright. The color of the animation was spectacular but the story line was bland and unengaging. I guess I can't expect every animated movie to be a &#34;Finding Nemo.&#34;
0425252868|5.0|I had heard of this story briefly through a magazine.  When I found out the book had been published I had to read it.  I greatly enjoyed reading this book - it was difficult to put it down.  I am glad that they met again after the war, and that their story could be told.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes history, or who just wants to read a book about the actions of two honorable men.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was not rocket science, but it was pure joy and fun from start to finish. There were no plot twists but the writing and the acting (especially Rebel Wilson) were strong and - to borrow a line from the title - pitch perfect for a feel-good comedy. I love the idea of a Pitch Perfect 2, but I don't want to live through a similar experience from Grease 2. So I'll be happy with just this one movie (for now).
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie. Saw it in theaters and just had to own it! I also love that I could get the blu-ray/dvd/digital copy so affordable!
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|First saw Ellie Goulding at Lollapalooza in Chicago a few years back, so was excited when her latest CD finally dropped.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|hi I liked this game a lot it was really really fun and you should download it and play it too
B009NPKTN6|2.0|I heard so many great things about the musical on Broadway that I had higher expectations for the movie. This is classic example of when a play / live show does NOT translate to the big screen. The music was tolerable but it felt like everyone was &#34;calling in&#34; their performances.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Its a great app except it dosent allow me to use music as the sound. It says I don't have any music so until I can use music three stars.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|I was hopeful when viewing this movie because of the great cast lineup. But one-third into the movie, I started watching the clock. Never a good sign. By the two-thirds mark, I didn't care if I watched one more minute because the story was meandering and nothing was relatable.  Very disappointed.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This is a handy little app if you have a Kindle and just want to catch up on your reading. The best thing is that it is downloaded to my Samsung and so it has a back lit display so night time reading is a cinch. I am waiting for my Fire 8.7&#34; to arrive and will see how this compares. Just wish it had a voice option so I could plug and run while being read the story.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I loved all the Matt Damon Bourne movies, so Jeremy Renner had big shoes to fill in my books. I think this movie was solid and could easily serve as a segue to a new movie franchies with Renner at the helm.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My son was the one who actually got me started watching this show. Now the entire family is addicted. I really like the evolution of charactures and the change in location circumstances. You would think this show would be one dimensional, but it really has it all. I just hope my favorite actors do not get eaten this season!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I'm a huge Batman fan, but I found this last installment in the Dark Knight trilogy to move very slowly. The backstory that it tried to include to &#34;neatly tie up&#34; the three movies - in my opinion - failed to do so and only added to a movie already too long.
0670026603|1.0|I loved loved this book until the end.  I liked the characters and the character development.  I TOTALLY disagreed with the guys decision but I felt it is what he truly wanted to do.  UNTIL THE END.  His main logic was that he LOVED his life so much before the accident that he just could not see any value in his current life.  I didn't agree and felt that he never gave life after the accident a chance, but again he was determined.  THEN right before he died, by his own choice, he told the girl that his time with her had been the best of his life EVER.  Totally negating his entire logic for killing himself.  It then felt like he had been lying to the girl and that he was only trying to do a \\"make over\\" of her life.  I felt cheated and angry with the ending.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This movie was surprisingly sharp witted in some places, and unsurprisingly school boy infantile in most. It felt like a plush toy version of &#34;No Strings Attached&#34; or &#34;Friends With Benefits.&#34;
B008DGUT8Q|4.0|Italian trumpeter Rava is the brand name on this album of Michael Jackson tunes but it's clearly an ensemble effort. This is not to say that Rava doesn't solo beautifully -he does, but so do others among the young musicians in this twelve-piece ensemble. The arranger -who doubles on trombone and tuba in the ensemble- Mauro Ottolini deserves credit for his imaginative arrangements: they remind one of Gil Evans's  for Jimi Hendrix, (cf. Gil Evans Plays Jimi Hendrix) mixed together with a Fellini soundtrack. (I didn't know until I checked on Wikipedia that Rava played with Gil Evans some time in the 70s or 80s, although apparently he didn't record with him.)  The songs are presented as a suite with musical transitions between them. The only song by Jackson that I recognized at a glance was \\"Thriller.\\" The others are  mostly from his later albums. I hadn't known that Jackson had recorded the Charlie Chaplin tune, \\"Smile!\\" It's lovely, as is Rava's lyrical rendition of it here.<br /><br />The solo and ensemble sounds evoked from Rava makes evident his affinity with Miles Davis, whom he has named as inspiration in the past.  But on this album, it's the late Miles, the Miles who melded pop music with jazz and recorded songs like Cyndi Lauper's `Time After Time' and an album like Tutu.  Rava's facility in playing and his relaxed light sweet tone show to advantage on even the jumpiest and most percussive of these tunes. Ottolini has a few short solos on trombone, so does tenor man Kinzel, but the bear among soloists other than Rava is the guitarist, Gianninni, who plays blistering rock solos that latch on to the pop roots of Jackson's effervescent music. The two drummers drive the music: they do a good job of it but aren't otherwise particularly distinctive. (I wonder what a drummer like Billy Cobham would have done with it. Or Ginger Baker.)<br /><br />The album captures two live concerts by the Parco della Musica Jazz Lab, presented  in Rome in May and November of 2011. The music is very good and it's heartening to see an old lion like Rava work with bright young musicians from the coming generation.e music is very good and it's heartening to see an old lion like Rava work with bright young musicians from the coming generation.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|As a new writer, I found publishing for Kindle to be harder than I thought it should be. This book had some great tools to make the process less painful.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series. Movies are never as good as the read. This series is a great set for everyone. Five stars.
B008476HBM|1.0|I'm only giving a 1 star review because of the single issue referenced in my review title (it would be lovely to have separate 'formatting' reviews). It applies only to the edition of P&P with ASIN 'B008476HBM' ([[ASIN:B008476HBM Pride and Prejudice]]) and only on basic Kindle, Paperwhite, and Kindle Touch (these pay attention to language attributes so as to use a 'matching' dictionary).<br /><br />This happens to be the only edition of P&P enabled for WhisperSync for Voice (with a free audiobook available from Audible) which is why I got this edition and have discovered this issue.<br /><br />Otherwise, the formatting is good, and (so far as I've read) free of typos. The price is right. And of course, the story is great, and everybody should read it.<br /><br />It seems the language attribute for the book is not set to 'English' and so (again only on K/KT/KPW) one gets 'Dictionary Not Found\\" even though an English dictionary is available. On my Kindle Touch, it does a lookup in the Italian dictionary that I happen to have on there (and of course fails to find these English words). Dictionary lookup works fine on my Fire and I'm guessing on Kindle Keyboard and older Kindles, which always use the one and only default dictionary.<br /><br />It is probably possible to edit the language attributes (e.g. with calibre) so that it works correctly. But that only fixes that instance. Fresh downloads from Amazon will still have this problem, at least until it is fixed.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|Love the Lord of the Rings Lego Series. Can't find much fault in most things Lego creates. Good value for the money. Will ensure lots of creative play time for both kids and adults who are LOTR fans.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|No pulitzer prize here, but a good book with action and a thinking hero.<br />Number 2 is certainly next for me.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son was dying for this set...and it was hard to find without paying over $100. It's a tiny set and very cool for Minecraft fans, so I was so glad to score it for retail on AZ. He loved it. His absolute favorite gift for Christmas.
B009HELT3C|5.0|One of the best things about this movie...aside from the usual aliens...is the visit back in time to before the first MIB.  Josh Brolin is very convincing as the younger...well...you'll see.  Watch this movie!
B000OCXIDK|4.0|This makes you look at this beautiful painting in a completely new light because you see into the subject and how she sees the painter.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|What a great movie!  Not the original, so don't expect it to be.  Advances in digital special effects have made this one a totally new experience from the first.  Colin Farrell doesn't a spectacular job, and (not to give anything away) you'll come to hate Kate Beckinsale.  Just sayin'...
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is an amazing writer and this book does not disappoint. This book is great if you are an artist because it explains the essence of what art is.
0425252868|5.0|This was an extraordinary book - with a view that we had heard only mention of - the German angst against the Nazi party. The telling of this story portrays the hardship of war and the honor of its combatants. Read it to my son and he was transfixed by the story. Lightened up a few of the mature references to drinking and violence to keep it PG. Lent it to my father in law who read it within two days - and remarked at the details and story line that wouldn't let him put the book down. No question this is a great story.

B005ARYEPK|5.0|Footloose is a great movie for those who love to get out on the dance floor and celebrate music or special occasions. Or to have a great time. Movie plot and script real good came in good shape and timely manner. Get this one if you don't have it yet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I always choose the ranking by how a book kept me engrossed, even when I suspect how it is going to turn out. The story was riviting.  The characters were mostly believable, after all, who knows what goes on in marriages.  I liked the book so much I decided to read another Gillian Flynn novel, Dark Places.Anxious to read more.
0767812166|5.0|Starman with Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen. What a great idea of the what if this was to happen to any of you movie storyline. Deserves great rating love the movie and you movie fans should get this one for your collection and viewing enjoyment.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This historical novel is one of the best I have ever read.  It is so well researched that each character seems alive today. Having just gone through an historic election and Innauguration, the book came alive as I read it.  The biographies at the beginning were so enlightening, gave me insight and information I had not read before.  I have read most everything this author has written, She is a national treasure as was Lincoln and his Team of Rivals! Read and Learn!
B009PNQUXO|5.0|it's a very good app store because you can look up interesting facts.a lot to chose from. we love it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fantastic game with addictive gameplay. Haven't had any freezing problems. Keeps the brain busy without hurting it. I highly recommend it.
1611761565|3.0|I liked the book, the description of the raid on Bin Laden's compound is compelling, but the book isn't just about that. The book follows the career of a special forces operative from when he joined the navy until he retired after the Bin Laden raid. Coverage of weapons and tactics is good and gives thanks to many in the intel community and support personnel that enable the warfighter to do his job. Does an admiarable job of being politically neutral in a story that had been very politicized.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a great book, it grabs you in from the very beginning, my only wish is that the sex scenes would have been more descriptive, however even without that I LOVED the book
1609611543|5.0|Just now getting into the book....but so far, it's very interesting. Hopefully it'll help with one of my New Year Eve's Resolutions. And even if it doesn't work, I can add the book to my ever expanding  &#34;Weight Loss Library&#34; .....(Like my waist)....lol
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app I have used!  It is free too!  It does everything want in a Bible app and more.
