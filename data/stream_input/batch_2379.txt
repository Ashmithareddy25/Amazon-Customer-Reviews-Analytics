B0016BP0PW|4.0|I like the story line. It did fit well with the GREAT Music. It brought me back to my youth. I do thank you for that.
B008I3RARW|3.0|The accelerometer doesn't track your movements very well. Can't really tell if its the software's fault or the hardware's fault, but the software should probably provide an alternate control panel for players who have trouble with their accelerometer.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|My 9 yr old got bored fast and my 4 yr old likes to watch the cars and trucks fall into the ravine. Sound can be turned off with main phone volume. Good physics game.
1401937268|5.0|These cards are gorgeous and very durable. I got them yesterday and have already had some amazing readings.  They are a bit hard to shuffle but that's because they are so thick and sturdy.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If there's anything you've ever wanted on a home video supplemental package for the Alien films, I'm sure it's in here somewhere.  I STILL haven't navigated through all of it, yet.  Got this on sale for $25.  Great Deal !
B00866JL96|5.0|If you have loved other movies based on Nichoals Spark's books. you'll love this one too. I didn't realize it was coming with a UV digital copy. Can't wait to try that out.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|A really nice Transfer, with even better sound round out this release, which also includes a nifty publicity featurette that ran in theaters and on TV, at the time of the film's release.  Too bad Crichton only did a commentary on The Great Train Robbery.  His extended thoughts on Westworld would've been a nice addition.  Well worth the price for fans, in any case.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Good game,  holds my attention.  I wish it had a few instruction for the exploxive bullets.  Wish it would go diagional, some other games do.  None the less, is over all a 3-4 star game.
B001E75QGG|4.0|I only got this (for $3.00 total, no less) enable to have a copy of the uncut doc. on the second disc about the making of the film.  Which is NOT included with the Blu-ray Indiana Jones set.  *shakes head*  Ridiculous.  Anyway.  The first disc is the same as the one in the four film set, but the second includes additional material, inexplicably left off the four disc set.  *scratches head*
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|This app will let you have private notes so when other people get on your device they can't get on there.
B002CN2NCG|5.0|But that's ok, all I had to do what type in amazon.co.uk and silverado, and lo and behold the UK release is Region 1/A, and includes the very same features as the U.S. release.  Ha-Ha, I win.  Awesome Blu-ray for fans of the film.  Check it out !
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to use, great functions, free. What more do you want?  Like the ability to set multiple alarms at once and to select what days you want them for.
B00009V7OL|3.0|The Blu-ray of this film is planned for sometime later this year (2013,) and should be essentially the same package.  This DVD version is very, very old, and looks it -- it's the same as the early 1990's Laserdisc.  Wait for a better presenation, if you can.  If not, just don't pay a fortune for it.
B008393Q2O|1.0|When entering a note, the app confused one word or name for another.  Could not correct the errors.  Other apps with similar functions had the same problems.
B0000DZTIL|1.0|Beware the Mill Creek version of this movie.  It is truly unbelievable that Mill Creek mass-produced this horrible transfer.  You - have - got - to be - kidding me.  Great movie !  Horrible DVD !  Buyer Beware !<br /><br />One would think somebody like Shout Factory would get the rights to do a better transfer of this, and put it on blu-ray.  Especially given how popular a cult sci-fi 80's film \\"My Science Project\\" is.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This is one of my husband's choices and I enjoyed it as well.  Of course, Sean Connery doesn't do many movies that aren't good.
B00001MXXH|5.0|Four words:  JOHN HUGHES AUDIO COMMENTARY.<br /><br />And the only one he ever did.  If you're a Hughes fan, snag it if you can.  It's worth it.  And it makes a nice companion piece to the Blu-ray.  (Which due to a recent deal with Paramount, Warner Bros. will be re-releasing soon)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i love the kindle it lets me keep my PDF the way i like it. It loads fast . i have recommended kindle fire to several family members and friends. Great product.I love that i can use the APP on other devices.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|Still a nice gem to have in your collection, if you're an 80's fan.  This is actually a recut version of the film, with a couple of scenes added.  Very nice.  I remember thinking the theatrical release felt a little unfinished, in terms of the kid's motivation.  Dante fixed that for home video.  There are even a couple of cut scenes added as an additional special feature.
B005MW8CWY|5.0|Although I am not enough of an aficianado to recognize major changes, I do enjoy the music from this all time classic.  Even if you are not a Smashing Pumpkins fan, you should enjoy this album as simply a rock fan of the 80s and 90s.
B00BR4QNJ0|2.0|Better than the original but still to hard to get gold. In game costs are insanely high. 50 bucks to unlock a character is crazy
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I am a closet Lord of the Rings fanatic and Peter Jackson didn't disappoint with that trilogy. This &#34;prequel&#34; brought back all the magic and wonder of Middle Earth that the first three did. The characters are outstandingly played and the cinematography is gorgeous. Even for those who have never really been interested in the Hobbit can enjoy this movie. I went with my mother to see it in theaters and she already can't wait for the second film.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I just have to say this is about my favorite Christmas movie!  I am so glad to have it in my personal collection :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the most fun reads I've had all year. Gripping story telling. Although the story seems grim, I enjoyed the exploration of humanity at it's best and worst.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|I didn't like this one at all , the dwarves looked like midgets and Gollums eyes were way to big .  I didn't like anything about this one.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Wry British humour at its best.  I recommend anyone considering marriage watch it.  I actually could relate to one of the characters.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I normally have a hard time reading long books but at the end I wanted it to keep going. Very addicting.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Amazon has what you want when you want it. just click and it's there. fast friendly easy and a fair price. Now that's convents at your fingertips.
B004NELBPC|1.0|So much was lost with the new app--I've deleted it from my Kindle. Text too small, can't turn sideways to make it larger, too many pics--became more complicated, rather than simpler. HuffPost, you screwed up.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I would highly recommend this book.  The characters are well developed and easy to visualize given the author's craftmanship with words.  The storyline is unique in how it unfolds.  It takes a very dark time in history and sheds light on to it.  I would recommend this novel for students as young as 6th grade.
0375851569|5.0|I bought this for my baby girl to start her off with the Dr.Seuss series. I'm so happy I got this; I wouldn’t hesitate to gift this to someone in the future. It's great and a must have to any child’s library.
B00BWAC0HI|5.0|i really love this book i have read it before but there was something wrong with the grammer and the spelling of some words
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Of all the camera gear that I've purchased this action stabilizer has been the best.  It has been the work horse of my video business. www.sauteelive.com If you need to move around a lot to get those tilts and pans this is what you want. I have light and sound stands that will fit on top of it and I mount my shotgun and stereo mics to it as well. The base will also mount to many tripod styles.
B00C6PWC4Y|5.0|This is actually the first male doll I have ever bought and must say.. Ryan doll looks very handsome, has a fierce face, great hair style (which is rare coz most Ken/Ryan dolls look kinda ridiculous with real hair)and the outfit is simply amazing, esp the metallic jeans. My only tiny disappointment was to find out that male fashionista dolls don't have bendable knees, but then I got over it coz lack of knee joints makes them stand infallibly plus I guess it adds to their \\"masculinity\\" (haha)<br />Very happy with it.. Will also be buying the Ken doll.
B000T433L0|5.0|I've always loved the opening of this amazing movie, the cinematography and music really set the tone in an almost modern film noir type of mood that is sustained throughout the film. De Niro is great as is the rest of the cast, but the highlight and focus is naturally on De Niro and watching his character ebb and flow into social and mental instability is compelling.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Beautifully written and loved the ending! It's a story of love and lessons. I do wish London and Brighton were described more to give better feel for UK space and time.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|Justin Timberlake does no wrong, as we all know.  You won't be disappointed by this DVD.  I watch/listen to it at least once a week while cleaning.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|decent. better than some of the defense games I've played. would like it more if you could acquire gold without the need to spend real money.
B003UPEH8S|5.0|I rarely buy music but this is one CD I know I can listen to over and over again it moves me
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Seems rather easy.  Hopefully the levels will get more difficult.  New birds are cool.  Just purchased the new ad free and finally can play a complete game with no distractions!
B005HE5J7I|5.0|This book is wonderfully written.  It really captures the history and vibrancy of the city.  Absolutely brilliant, engaging and informative..
B000TKW3E2|2.0|As per the title of this review, there is much in here worthy of praise and enjoyment. The themes, while generally downbeat and somber, are very vivid and emotional in their orchestration and execution by the orchestra and solosits. That said, this is a soundtrack album. A music CD. I don't know how else to put it. When people buy a soundtrack, they want THE MUSIC from the movie, not sound effects, dialogue, or other \\"cute\\" things that are presumably intended to take us back to the movie. If we wanted obnoxious typewriter sound effects overlaying the music (as in tracks 1, 4, 5, etc.), we'd watch the movie. However, the most egregious offense is the inclusion of a hymn sung - I'm guessing - by soldiers in the movie which is nauseatingly integrated into BY FAR the most beautiful piece on the soundtrack (in actuality, one of the most heart wrenching pieces of music I've ever heard) \\"Elegy For Dunkirk\\". (A similar integration of a bodyless mens chorus occurs less distractingly in \\"Come Back\\" as well, but the rest of the track is ruined by the return of the stupid typewriter anyway, so it seems less offensive.) All in all, I hope a specialty soundtrack label (La-La-Land, Intrada or the like) releases an expanded edition of this soundtrack sans stupidity somewhere down the road. In the meantime, if you must have the music from Atonement right this minute, download tracks 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (if you can bear it), 12, 13, 14, and 15. Skip 1, 5 and 11, and pray that the unadulterated music turns up later in our lifetime.
0756659841|5.0|I bought this for my 8 yo brothers birthday and everyone loves it! there are a lot of stickers that don't go to a specific page which is nice to share and use for other places.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I love this album! Fall Out Boy just keeps on getting better and better! Great songs to run to and to dance spontaneously to!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I love everything about it. This is one of my all time favorite movies, and the keepsake edition has touching extra features :-)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was hesitant at first , but after finishing the Hunger Games trilogy I was very impressed on the books. Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job at the 'visual' effects of the story. Highly recommend the books.
B003TH14H4|5.0|We just love the characters and the way they interact. His home and family life blends right into the plot always giving him a clue to the solution.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Can't wait for book three. Several times in the book I was left thinking that the coincidence of characters meeting as they did was totally ridiculous, such as when Boy crashed his plane. Enjoy the story and the history.
B005MW8CUG|5.0|I can totally relate to Billy Corgan, he is a genius. The album is beautifully written and mesmerizing, I wish I was into the Smashing Pumkins during the albums release but they have come into my life during  difficult phase and have been incredibly therapeutic. I highly recommend this album to anyone.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Movie arrived very quickly. My grandson (who is 2 1/2 years old) loves robots and adores this movie! It is a great family movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is the best game I have ever played on a tablet computer. It is a game for children of all ages and adults are eligible to play this game just as much as anyone.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|Got this app to place text over images. There are no font choices and once text is placed it can't be moved. Awful.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What seem like a love story turned out to be something compleatly different i loved it. Would recommend it to anyone.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My 5 year old twin daughters absolutely love all the Dr. Panda apps. I'll even admit that I like to play them as well. They are very well created and each app has plenty of different activities to chose from!
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Excellent game you have to keep the game circle on to run the game... Even if you are offline that would be the only bad thing of the game
076115728X|5.0|Just delightful, creative, and child-inspired art work.  If you teach preschool or early elementary, you could design a whole art unit on this, and it'd be a awesome bulletin board!  child-centered, not picture perfect art where each kids' projects are identical!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is really a sweet movie.  It's all about love (new, lost, young, old, language barrier etc.).  I liked every single storyline except the one with the guy who goes to Wisconsin and the porn players.  What's amazing about this movie is that they packed it with a lot of famous stars (Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightly, Laura Linney etc.).  I doubt it can be replicated now due to the cost but this is the perfect rom com.  Garry Marshall only wished he did it better with V-Day and New Year's Eve or whatever that one was called.<br /><br />The ones that made me teary eyed was Colin Firth and Liam Neeson's storylines.  Very heartfelt.<br /><br />If you've never seen Love Actually before, you should check it out.  A very enjoyable movie.
0061733199|5.0|This is a great survival book. Great to read through, but even better to keep handy should you really need it in an emergency situation. You will not regret buying this book!
B00BKTFABE|5.0|I'm still amazed on what this camera can do I took it on an recent trip I took and I just have great pictures and videos of the whole thing, I think this camera is just awesome!!!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|OMG!!!!! I have wanted to see this movie since I came upon the trailer a while ago, and I finally have got to watch it and OMG!!!! what an beautiful and amazing love story between two people that overly love each other. Even tho the love is between two brothers ... it is a profound story about love and what it can over come. Makes me want to know how to love like that and how it feels.
B001QWBM62|1.0|I bought this zoom based on great reviews and while I'm sure it's a great little machine, I'm returning it because it says that there is no card when I try to record. Of course, the card is inserted in the correct way (it only can be inserted properly due to the notch on the edge). I've tried very hard to find a tech support phone number, but to no avail, only offers to email my question. I don't do well with describing technical stuff in writing as I'm not very versed in audio tech speak. Maybe I'm doing something wrong? Maybe it's broken? Maybe the card is dead? Who knows? I certainly can't find anybody in the company to ask. So, back it goes.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|A riveting account of what realy goes on in modern day warfare. I didn't enjoy it as much as Chris Kyles book from the point of view of the narrative but still a good read.
0385535147|3.0|\\"The Racketeer\\" is a story about Malcolm Bannister, a black lawyer who's serving time in jail for a crime he didn't commit.  Then a federal judge gets murdered; and, amazingly and coincidentally, Malcolm thinks he knows who the murderer is.  So before long, Malcolm was able to cut a deal that got him out of jail and into the witness protection program.  Of course, this being a John Grisham novel, nothing is as it seems.  And for the rest of the book, the readers are left with the unenviable but enjoyable task of following the twists and turns to figure out what is really going on.<br /><br />As many readers have noted before me, this book is not a \\"legal thriller\\" one has come to expect from John Grisham in the conventional sense.  It's not even a conventional thriller.  Instead, it's one of those slow-burn books that take its time to set up all the players, give out all the clues, until everything that has happened before ultimately leads to the \\"AHA\\" moment in which the reader finally sees all the pieces falling together.  And while I did enjoy the \\"AHA\\" moment and marvel at the author's ingenuity, the problem is that I had to slog through pages after pages of uninspired writing to get there.  Don't get me wrong, the author did an adequate job of laying out all the clues along the way plot-wise, but Malcolm as a narrator is so boring, his voice so generic, that it was never a problem for me to put the book down when there is something else that I needed to do.  The narration was dry, matter-of-fact, and failed to inbue Malcolm with any kind of personality.  If it weren't for the name and the fact that he mentioned several times that he's black, I wouldn't have been able to tell if hes black, white, male, or female.  The narration also lacked any emotion, so that we as the readers never really got to know what Malcolm is feeling or what his motivations are.  And that made it very hard for me to identify with or root for him, which detracted greatly from my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />In summary, this is not the worse of the John Grisham books or the best.  If you enjoy intricately-plotted thriller, this may be worth a shot, provided that you can overlook the dry writing style that made this book not quite a page turner for me.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|An all-time favorite sci-fi movie. For its time, the effects are well done. The color is rich. Great cast. We are glad to have this available to enjoy once again.
0307950654|2.0|In \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\", the author P.D. James has re-imagined the beloved regency comedy-of-manners into a murder-mystery.<br /><br />That in itself may not be a bad thing, but the problem is that by focusing on the murder of Captain Denny and George Wickham's possible involvement in the whole affair, Elizabeth and Darcy has been swept to the sidelines.  This is not their story anymore as much as it is George Wickham's, as the latter is given a full back story and plot line while Elizabeth and Darcy are relegated to the role of observers.  After a well-written prologue in which their story is re-hashed via what I though a pretty good imitation of Austen's inimitable writing style, Elizabeth and Darcy's story basically came to an abrupt standstill.  Throughout the rest of the book, Elizabeth is barely there while Darcy ends up spending the rest of the book observing Wickham's trial.  Occasionally, the author would show us an intimate moment between Darcy and Elizabeth, but as characters they neither grew or even had anything to do during the entire book.<br /><br />And the lack of Elizabeth and Darcy focus would not be half as bad if the mystery is even remotely interesting or skillfully presented, which it is not.  For some reason the author decided not to give one character the responsibility of investigating Captain Denny's murder, so whenever something about the mystery needs to be revealed, we would have some random and arbitrary character show up to tell us how he or she managed to stumble upon a crucial piece of evidence.  This method of story telling is contrived, scatter-shot, and not very interesting.  The scenes of the trial are also hot messes, because both the defense and prosecution would basically ask key witness questions that would make them rehash what we already know about the entire case.  For example, there is an employee of the inn that Captain Denny and George Wickham were staying in that witnessed an argument between Denny and Wickham.So right after Captain Denny's murder, he related the entire story to the Darcy household.  Then, at the trial, he spent another chapter relating the exact same story without providing any additional insight.  The author seems to recognize this as well, so at one point, she even had a lawyer observing the proceedings tell Darcy point-blank how the trial is going - if he thinks the prosecution or the defense has the upper hand.  Why is this necessary?  Because the conversation between the defense, prosecution, and the witnesses were so meandering and devoid of insight, that just by reading the dialogue it is impossible for the readers to tell if the defense or the prosecution is doing a better job!<br /><br />So, if anyone were to ask me to use one word to describe this ill-conceived sequel, the word I would use is \\"pointless\\".  For readers who are looking to see their favorite couple's story continue, they won't find it here.  For readers who couldn't care less about Elizabeth and Darcy and simply want to read a good mystery, they won't find that here either.
0786956291|5.0|I bought this so I could introduce my kids to this great game of adventure, creativity, and imagination. So far, we've played a few times and even my wife says it's more fun than she expected. Can't wait for our next adventure!
0812984412|2.0|The movie trailers made it seem like a new \\"Matrix\\" movie was coming along - I was sorely disappointed. You know those recent films which have several stories going on at once and have them converged at some point? This book tries it and fails. The stories are not interesting, one does not care for the characters. The varying literary style that fits the stories' times are interesting, but too often clumsy. It feels like the author writes for himself.<br /><br />As many have pointed out, the story fails to connect the dots on the end. At some stage in the book, you will wonder what the point in all this is, and reading will become a frustrated search to scrap any meaning from the book. You will be disappointed, because there is no point in these stories.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|With historical and political accuracy, Child 44 is a thriller that takes place in Stalin's Soviet Union, a society in which millions live in fear of the State and where a mere suspicion of ideological disloyalty sends millions of innocents to the Gulags or to their deaths. Defending the system from its citizens is the MGB, the State Security Force - and there is no more courageous or idealistic an MGB officer than Leo Demidov.  That is until he uncovers the existence of a serial child killer. Then he finds himself disenchanted by the system he has sworn to serve because they have no interest in acknowledging that murders are taking place - not in a country propagating the myth that crime does not exist. Leo finds himself demoted and denounced by his enemies, his world turned upside down, and every belief he's ever held shattered. The only way to save his life and the lives of his family is to uncover this criminal. An excellent read, this book is part of a trilogy and is being made into a film scheduled for release in 2014.

B000000WJZ|4.0|One of the most beautifully written albums I have ever heard. Cheap and fast shipping too! As good or better than any Nirvana album.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I replaced my JVC Sport Clip earbuds with the Sony MDR-W08L headphones. The JVC Sport Clip earbuds sounded awful so I wrote a review on them and sent them back to Amazon. I read all of the glowing reviews for these and it really got my hopes up but even though these sound much better than the JVC Sport Clips, the bass is still disappointing. I listen to anything from Hard Rock to Hip Hop and the bass is there, which is more than the JVCs had to offer, but it is still lacking. I've never owned a pair of earbuds before the JVCs so maybe I'm just expecting too much sound from such tiny speakers. I guess what I'm really looking for is cover-the-ear sound from an in-the-ear product and I'm not even sure it exists. The volume level from my Sansa Clip Zip is very strong however and they are quite comfortable to wear for long periods so that is a plus.<br /><br />If I had to break down the quality of each feature, it would look like this with 1 being the worst rating and 5 being the best...<br /><br />Overall Sound: 3<br />Bass Level: 2<br />Comfort: 4<br /><br />Overalll Rating: 3<br /><br />If these had cost any more than the $10.00 I paid, I would be returning them but I will keep using them until I find something better. If you're really looking for a full bass sound with clear mids and highs, you will most likely want to search elsewhere. If you're looking for comfort and secure earbuds to use while on the move with decent sound, these might be the right choice for you.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I just love this app there are so many different cute!!!<br />This is just like owning a pet of your own. You have to feed them and play with them to.

B00C9QQBA6|5.0|I was turned onto this book by a friend who had nothing but great things to say about it. I like to read a wide variety of fiction, so I figured I would check it out.<br /><br />Having said that, I had never before heard about what happened in Aurora, TX (which is the basis for Aurora Conspiracy) and I'm not much of a SciFi fan. As a result, I was a bit hesitant to buy the download but since it only cost $.99 I figured I would check it out.<br /><br />I sat down to read with a bit of hesitation, but once I started reading that hesitation quickly turned to anticipation.  The last time I was hooked so quickly by a book was when I read The DaVinci Code. All it took was a couple pages and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The pace is quick and keeps you engaged at all times. There is sufficient character background and depth to paint a crisp picture, but not so much that you get bored by the details. Instead, the focus is on the action and there is plenty of it. Maybe I'm a closet SciFi fan, or maybe this form of SciFi is better than others, but all I know is I really liked it.<br /><br />I also checked out the Aurora Conspiracy website at [...] It took a while to find the site because most searches for \\"Aurora Conspiracy\\" turn up the theater shootings that happened in Aurora, CO. (Sad coincidence.) However, when I typed in \\"Aurora Conspiracy book\\" I was able to get the right website. It looks like the site is still being built out, but it already has a decent amount of content and gives some good background on the basis for the book, the characters, conspiracy theories (my favorite section), the authors, etc. The site also gives info on upcoming episodes (from what I can tell, it looks like they want to make them into a TV show) and also mentions that there will be a trilogy of books.<br /><br />Speaking of the books, I was able to download the first 2 chapters for free from the website. I really liked the chapters and wanted to buy the book, but I can't find a link on the site to buy it. I also can't find the book for sale on Amazon. Does anybody have any idea if it is available or not?<br /><br />Anyway, overall I would give this episode 5 stars...and that's high praise coming from a guy who typically isn't enamored with SciFi. Now if I could just figure out how to buy the book...n the site to buy it. I also can't find the book for sale on Amazon. Does anybody have any idea if it is available or not?<br /><br />Anyway, overall I would give this episode 5 stars...and that's high praise coming from a guy who typically isn't enamored with SciFi. Now if I could just figure out how to buy the book...

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|THE NEXT DAY definitely stands among the best Bowie albums, from the opening, killer uptempo title-track (a mindblowing mix of glam era and Berlin) to the astonishing kraut-arrangements in \\"How Does The Grass Grow?\\". A 60s aura lies over songs like \\"Valentine's Day\\", \\"I'd Rather Be High\\" and \\"You Feel So Lonely...\\", though presented in a completely new frame. I really loved the new Bowie and I was so happy when I heard producer Visconti saying that new songs are on the way. Mainstream music is safe at least for 2013!
0061726834|4.0|Well, I'm having a severe case of holycrapthatwasawesome-itis. What an awesome dystopian! Like...wow!<br /><br />Okay, so it took me longer than usual to read this, and I think that's because of finals and all that crap. Needless to say, I was quite impressed with this book, and I will definitely continue on with the rest of the trilogy.<br /><br />Enter Magdalena \\"Lena\\" Halloway-Tiddle, a normal girl who counts down the days to her procedure, where she will be cured and rendered immune to amor deliria nervosa, known to all us science haters as \\"love.\\" The United States now lives behind a fenced border, cut off from the rest of the world due to the outbreak of this delirium, and society is regulated to a tee. The government gives you evaluations to give you three or four choices for a suitable match for marriage. Only certain books, movies, and music can be read, watched, or listened to. Basically, the government controls everything.<br /><br />This is a huge issue in most places of the world, and I love how putting it into the context of the United States can show people just how dangerous unlimited government is for us. They make you believe what they want you to believe. You only know what they want you to know. It's terrifying...when you realize the world you've believed to be infallible is in fact the exact opposite. And that's what I love so much about this series.<br /><br />The concepts of romance and dystopia have been merged successfully to the point where I'm completely floored with amazement. Lauren Oliver also manages to accomplish complex world-building by including snippets from literature and pieces of propaganda to show the reader what people were and were not allowed to read, and what they were taught (and basically brainwashed) to believe as children in this society. I thought that was SUPER creative and different from any other books out there.<br /><br />As far as characters go, I loved Lena as the MC. She went through a huge transformation justin this book alone. She's a strong-willed young woman, and so many of us strong women are being put down; being told we're nothing. And Lena breaks through that slander and shows those douches who's boss. And Alex....ohmysweetlord Alex... *swoon* This hunk of sexy better infect me ASAP. That's all I'm sayin'.<br /><br />Things started off a little too slow for me, though. That's the only problem I had was the pacing. At least to me, the book seemed to progress fairly slowly until about page 80 or so when things really heated up. But it was a struggle trying to get through the beginning. So glad I pushed myself to continue!<br /><br />And that ending....sdkljfhsldkfhslkdjfhslkdjfhskjdfhsdfliuwehsdfs. Enough said.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I thought it was so good I read it twice. We saw the movie and even bought the DVD. I think we need more books like this.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Hilarious show that represents the teenage/young adult demographic. Episodes aren't too long; about 20 minutes per show. Can't wait until the 3rd season airs.
B008BM9L72|2.0|I thought it would get better so i kept on reading praying that it would, when i read the second book or skimmed through it, i realized that it was still rubbish so i deleted off my kindle and never read the third book
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I was looking forward to this season after I was 'late' to the Walking Dead bandwagon. I rushed through seasons 1 & 2, (which were great) however, season 3 starts off alright, but takes a horrible turn to boring in a matter of a few episodes... It gets even slower near the end of the season. I actually have been quite disappointed overall in season 3.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I finally broke down and purchased GoT after re-reading the complete series and, at last, the final book. The script appears to be very faithful to the original story line and the casting is as good as it could possibly be. So far it's brilliant and I'm absolutely loving it. It might be a bit difficult to follow if you have not read the book as there are a lot of characters to absorb but it's definitely worth it. A bit raunchy in places so be warned if you have young kids as it's definitely a more European open-minded production with adult content and themes. Enjoy!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|love this series, great stories and writing and closed quick than dragged out, and who doesn't love a British accent
B0036BK6MW|5.0|We love this movie - so much that  we will watch it over again - we think Sandra Bullock did a great job.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Each book when you think they're gonna kind of related and be the same you get side worded. The these books are only getting more and more addictive by the page! I'm so intrigued with the mystery and the romance of everything it is definitely a must read.
B000E3E45K|5.0|Buy this book, you'll never be sorry.  CLavell's writes about the early history of Japan before its discovery by white people.  I read this story years ago and loved it, loaned it out and never got it back. It is a shame Mr. Clavell has passed away for he writes with a flare for history and keeps your interest all the way through the book.  A wonderful author and I'm glad I have a collection of his other books.  Thank you.  ALC
B009FZFONO|5.0|... and now I'm hooked! Everything downloaded to my TiVo Premier Elite and (Surprise!) no commercials interrupting the action. I hadn't though about that but it was a feature worthy of mention in the advertisement for this download.

B00B0ND67K|5.0|This is a wonderful collaboration of three great musicians, the vocals are stunning along with great writing, you will not be disappointed by purchasing this music.
0812984412|5.0|I must say that this author is a very good writer, at least as far as I can tell. There were no wasted lines in the entire book. The dialogue/narration/story telling flowed very nicely. I honestly can't point to any sentence in the book where I thought to myself that it was stupid.<br /><br />The book is broken up into nine major parts. The first five parts deal with five different characters whose stories are told, but only halfway, except for the fifth part that is told in its entirety. The last four parts finish off the stories of the first four parts. Parts one through nine are told in chronological order, and each part has a way of relating to the previous part in the book. The author manages to show a relation from one part to a previous part, but then when you get to the second half of the book, you know things in advance, and can see how the present influences the future. It's written in a way that makes almost complete sense to me. The book is extremely well-written, but a little bit labyrinthine. There are so many connections between past, present and future, it's amazing. It seems evident to me that there was an intended symmetry to the book. I think the author considered a time frame of several hundreds of years as maybe one period in the sinusoidal grand history of the human race.<br /><br />Along the way, there are a great many ideas presented. It seems to me that the most overriding theme involves freedom. Indeed, the basic plotline of each of the nine basic stories involves someone trying to gain freedom. Freedom (or slavery) comes in various forms, and several are considered in this book. There are also more grandiose figures and themes such as a Jesus-like character, sentiency, fate (and how we can change it), and reincarnation.<br /><br />The most obvious influence that I can think of is \\"Brave New World\\" by Aldous Huxley, but the sentiency should inform you that \\"Brave New World\\" is a starting point, as that novel dealt with people who were fairly complacent - in \\"Cloud Atlas\\", the characters realize that something is missing in their lives - a freedom that they feel has to exist. I suppose this book takes \\"Brave New World\\" and adds sentiency.<br /><br />So, you can see that there are some seriously deep themes involved. Now, let me focus on the author's writing skills, which are quite impressive.<br /><br />Firstly, he's able to interject thoughts into paragraphs of dialogue. He does this with italics. This might seem silly, but it works perfectly. Nothing has to be spelled out for you, those italics just appear and you know immediately what they mean. Secondly, the author employs different types of speech for every major story. At times, it takes you a little while to get the cadence of the words, but the learning curve is not so bad even in the most radical deviances from our current speech patterns. I have no real way of knowing, but I'm guessing that the way people talked was accurate in this book (the future, of course, is a different story). In fact, each character has a unique vocal pattern.<br /><br />The basic story of the book starts around 1850 and ends somewhere in the 2200's (maybe a little later, I'm not sure). Throughout this time period, the author focuses on six lives that occur at different points in the given time period.<br /><br />The first character occurs around 1850, and the second character occurs right after WW1. After that, the next character appears in the early 1970's. After that, we get present day, about 2011. Jump forward some (I don't know how much on this one, but I've seen somewhere that it was about 2050). Finally, the timeline ends somewhere around 2300. The book explores man's progression through that time period.<br /><br />In the 1850's, the main character is a pretty devout Christian and fairly naive, but a good man. Jump forward 60 years, and this person is now somewhat duplicitous, but also more artistic and romantic - his morals are more frayed than the previouscharacter. Next comes the 1970's with its inherent cynicism - our character is no longer naive, and even manages to uncover massive corruption. In our current time, the major character is an older man on the verge of being put in an old folks home forever (I'm not sure what this part means aside from it represents an ageing character who might be afraid of dying, and that seems to fit with the overall purpose of the book). About forty years after that, we meet the highest form of this character as a Jesus-like figure (Somni-451, a pretty obvious nod to \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"). After the Somni character, we seem to find our ultimate version of the character to be some sort of savage, trying to survive in a terrible, post apocalyptic world (I suspect that this is influenced by \\"Brave New World\\").<br /><br />Then, the author has a way of circling back all the way to the beginning. At each stage, our major character seems to have moments of epiphany that relate to future and past versions of that character. The overall arc of the major character seems to model that of some form of average man (average in a statistical sense) for each of these time periods. In this respect, I guess the author argues that your average person must has evolved in a certain way, but each of these average men seems to be more good than bad (with the extreme of Somni). Overall, I believe the book is hopeful.<br /><br />As a final note, I should mention that I bought this book after watching the movie of the same title. I loved the movie, and understand that the movie fits in with a personal vision of the directors (the Wachowski Brothers, or more recently, Siblings). These two directed The Matrix movies, \\"V is for Vendetta\\", and now \\"Cloud Atlas\\". Every single one of these movies deals with the idea of freedom. The Matrix movies have a very direct \\"Brave New World\\" feel to them - except that some of the characters know they are under control, and they choose to do something about it. Each movie features a martyr/savior character. Finally, all the movies have some form of slavery in them. The book and the movie might cover similar themes, but they do so in quite different ways. If you read the book and expect the same in the movie, forget about it. And vice versa. However, I believe that both the movie and the book stand equally, but separately, as art.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This is a beautiful movie. I had a smile on my face from beginning to end. I've never seen a presentation remotely similar to Silver Linings Playbook. I look forward to watching it again and again. Wonderful script and extremely believable acting! One of my favorite movies all-time.
B000005ILF|3.0|This seems to be the least creative of his albums. Some songs are outright repetitive of their simple 1 or 2 lines of lyrics and just repeats the same tune and lyric again and again and again and... OK music but certainly not a jewel.
6305428042|5.0|Bette Milder is a great actress love this movie I also love the clear picture love the dvd when its clear its a good family movie
B007HC3LHS|2.0|I read the first several chapters but couldn't really get into it. I was so sick of reading about her OC acts. I am sure if and when I go back to reading it, it will pick up and become as interesting as the Introduction was. That was the reason I bought the book.
0062060554|1.0|On the back of the book one reviewer says \\"Memento on Chrystal Meth.\\"  Perhaps he was sincere and simply meant \\"Memento, but with missing teeth and god-awful.\\" Or... maybe he meant you'd have to *do* Chrystal Meth to destroy enough brain cells to enjoy this book.
B00181MHQU|4.0|The version we watched is low grade SD and the title sections did not properly make the transition to whatever file format they use..<br />It would be nice if could be remastered though I don't know how it was originally shot.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love Dexter so amazingly much. I rarely buy DVDs because they just clutter up my shelves. But Dexter is one of the few series that I will happily buy in order just to keep around for whenever I wish to watch back at old episodes. If you haven't watched this show yet you must. Micheal C Hall is one of the best actors I've seen. I first fell in love with him in HBO's series Six Feet Under- another fantastic DVD set that I own.<br /><br />If you have watched Dexter, then I would highly recommended reading the books. They add a whole new level of excitement. Add to the fun!<br /><br />Out of all the seasons of Dexter, this season is one of my favorites.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|My favorite Paul Newman movie.  One of the few movies I can watch anytime.  Instantly compelling.  Is he a nonconformist or just a screwball?
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Great movie  I have seen this play several times in various venues but this is the first time it put the movie right up close and personal.  The actors and actresses could not have been better.  Love this angle of looking at a great movie.
B0013O123Q|4.0|If the idea of graphic rape or brutal violence disturbs you do not watch this! Otherwise a good story and great acting.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|I also have 2 friends of mine who perform in this movie! Always entertaining to watch The Muppets! LOVED IT!!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Showed us how story evolved over time. lots of special effects..The only flaw,(as I see it) was no indication that this was Part one of how manny? .

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|God has lead me to this. He is the only reason why I received this. Because of The Lord I have learned so much. Thank you Jesus for this book!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This appeared to be an unusual story about the war in Europe.  As it was it was absolutely facinating.  Lots of background information about the primary characters.  the author weaves the story in a easily told format.  This is a true story with authentic photos of the characters and awards.  A wonderful easy read.  I would recommend this story to all!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Ever since I received my Kindle, I have been reading old classics and they are well worth it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was a life saver as we missed the season finale.  I'm so glad Amazon offered this at such a low price.

B00942X8PY|5.0|This game is a puzzle game where you have to make your lines fit in the area. The challenge is the small spot that you have to put it in and you cannot change the size of the spot nor the size of the finished line. The other challenge is that you do not know what the shape of the finished line will need to be.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Love the game but as of yesterday when I'm guessing the last tournament ended it will not load..... please help :(
B00B99KJR0|3.0|Is this worth buying? Not unless you like swap matching games or the Around the World in 80 Days a whole lot.

B00280LYIM|5.0|I would recommend this book to ANYONE who is into sci-fi and Harry potter I also like the book because it is epicly funny but beware,there is romance involved :( and I would read it for AR,or reading counts whichever your school does p.s. it is 21 RC Points
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|In the past few weeks I was steadily growing more excited, but I was also afraid I was going to be disappointed. But it's finally here, and it was very much worth the wait.<br /><br />Save Rock and Roll is unapologetically loud, fast, passionate...and imperfectly perfect. I think this record has brought them full circle. This IS Fall Out Boy. It feels like they have created a living memorial to all of their previous albums. The unrestrained energy of Take This. The tongue-in-cheek and determination of Cork Tree. The anything-and-everything-could-happen music styles of Infinity. And the soaring vocals of Folie. I can feel them all echoing. If this hadn't come after a hiatus, I would have thought this was meant as a goodbye. But there's undeniably something new and exciting about every song. It's infectious and fun and feels like a natural progression while still keeping everything I've always loved about them.<br /><br />Maybe it is a goodbye to the past, making way for whatever comes in the future. But, if this is the last that we are given from Fall Out Boy... I am content with this. It feels like an end, but somehow also like a beginning. And I am so thankful to Andy, Joe, Patrick, and Pete for creating it. I loved this album. It made me smile uncontrollably. It made me cry. It made me remember. It made me want to jump up and move. It made me want to take a drive and blare it while singing as loud as possible. Every single second was golden to me.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i get alot of helpful weather alerts, however with all the maps and charts i get lost.<br />i would like to see it become moer simpler to use.
0345803493|5.0|Same or better quality as described. so satisfied with the product. this is my 1st used book purchased online. Nice.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like reading books about happy things with some sort of a reality attached to it.  Glad to see the main character had the gumption to do something about her awful life and found happiness in the pursuit of freedom.
B007UQRW62|5.0|Simple review. If you love this movie and like limited edition collectibles, buy it. If you're even looking at this you know the movie. The blu-ray and dvd are the main reason, but the book is very informative and the umbrella is better quality than I expected. It's just really cool to have a numbered limited edition of something classic. You'll be glad you made the purchase.
B00338QENI|5.0|I'm glad that this information has been brought to the light.  Our country keeps way-too-many secrets.  This was well written with just enough concise data for the story.  It was never boring or so factual that the truth is lost in a maze of statistics.<br /><br />Well done!!  I hope we learn from this truth.
B00ANVX6DY|3.0|I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter who is all about princesses. She was disappointed that it was such a short movie. She had just started to really enjoy it and it was over. I wouldn't buy another &#34;Sofia&#34; movie because of this. She has not watched it again.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|I read this for a book club otherwise I would have quit before finishing. I found the writing poor, the plot trying to hard to be sensational and the main characters flat and uninteresting. In addition, the conclusion (but not the exact details) was totally predictable. I have no idea why the majority of reviews have been positive except that it has been marketed as being great so most readers follow the crowd!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I found that this book lacked any suspense, as much of the story was predictable. I also felt that Flynn did a poor job with character development; often integrating multiple characters with little substance. However, I did feel as though Flynn accurately depicted a sociopath and the power struggles, manipulation, and games that they play. The ending of the book was disappointing and anticlimactic.
B00AO686MY|5.0|Love this movie for the technical aspects of drawn cartoon work (not CGI) interaction with live actors.  Beautiful graphics and oh so interesting storyline and characters.  Not really for young kids as the villain is a real meanie with his &#34;dip&#34;.  The bonus features were all very entertaining and interesting as well.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I just finished this book, I had a hard time putting it down for dinner. I cannot believe how it ended I need to know the rest of the story! I love his characters and feel like I can see them. Cannot wait for the next one!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is truly a gift.  Dr. Alexander felt compelled to share his profound NDE experience, and he has become in a sense a modern day prophet.  The book does not use traditional religious images, but rather transcends orthodoxy with a deeply spiritual description of afterlife.  I especially appreciated his reflections on the meaning and source of consciousness.  There is much to ponder in his writing, and his bibliography gives many excellent sources for continued study.  This is one of the few books I have encountered that upon finishing it, I immediately read it a second time, and began recommending it to others.  Because it does not use traditional religious language, this book can be a deeply meaningful experience for people of any faith background (or lack thereof).<br /><br />My only quibble is the title...perhaps suggested by the publisher as a way to pique popular interest.  Dr. Alexander is simply describing his experience, not trying to prove anything, and the word &#34;heaven&#34; is used rarely if at all in the book. A more accurate title would be  (smile) &#34;Reflections on the Meaning of Life, Love, and Consciousness Following a Life-Threatening Illness Written by a Neurosurgeon Who Really Understands How the Brain Works&#34; ... but in the publishing world, less is more as far as titles go.  Bottom line - a fascinating and enriching read, highly recommended.
B00BC55S7M|5.0|When I heard that Iced Earth was putting out a new dvd I was so Excited. They have really been tearing it up since their newest album dystopia. After all the years Iced Earth has been formed, this concert dvd their true passion for their music and their energy. With Stu Block as their singer they have become stronger and more united than ever. He can hit the high notes like tim owens and can come close to the low notes of Matt Barlow. I loved this dvd from start to finish. This is probably by far one of the best Concert dvd I've ever seen. Long live Iced Earth
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I can't wait for the next book to come out. This book is awesome, I read it in 2-3 days it was so good. If I were you, and you read the first two books, get the book. One of the best ones yet.

B005MHI0QM|5.0|I decided to read this book because I am hoping to travel to Amsterdam this summer and want to visit the Ann Frank house while we are there.  Also my dad was a paratrooper with 101st airborne and he had been part of the liberation of Holland, I wanted to learn more about the lives of the people, both in hiding and on the outside.  I gave the book 5 stars because her life deserved 5 stars, I did not remember she had been in hiding for such a long time. Anne Frank's diary was surprisingly interesting, I mean how much can you write about when you are in hiding?  She was quite a character and surely would have been a great author.

1451695195|3.0|I have read some of the reviews and I see that many people have had very heated discussions about afterlife and NDEs and whether the author, Eben Alexander did or didn't have one and so on.  I feel that I stand somewhere in the middle in the skepticism spectrum so I am not saying I believe the things he said were true or not.  There is so much we don't know, so many unanswered questions.  I strongly believe in God but there are things in life that shake up one's faith like when the children of Sandy Hook were murdered you can't help but think how was that allowed to happen?!...but then the core beliefs take over again in believing, or at least wanting to believe.  As far as the book is concerned, it was good and interesting but to me at least, it felt boring at times.  When he went on an on about brain science, he kind of lost me, and mind you I'm an educated person, but I guess the topic is kind of a snoozer for me.  I wish he had instead focused more on the side of the personal experience, stuck more to the experience he had, and his family's.  I hardly even remember him mentioning his wife at all after his coma.  What about his children?  He mentions his older son a bit but what about the little boy?...I don't know I guess for me, I was more interested in his human experience than his scientific explanation for it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is an invaluable app,, at a glance or in-depth analysis of remaining battery power. Let's you know how long you can read,play or watch to the minute. Simple to navigate,easy to understand, a must have for every Kindle owner.
B0055S348W|5.0|This is a great app on my kindle fire! I was able to locate my printer and is able to print documents, pics and even web pages. All with a click of a button. Very easy to use. It can pick up any printer that is able to pick up on Wi-Fi. This is worth the 12.95 for those who are on the go or wants to do quick prints. Great for school use. I homeschool my kids and they will use this app on my kindle to print out their worksheets. It's a great app.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I have no problem with cursing in general, but in this movie it was over done and almost gratuitous...and virtually no filter between thinking a 'bad thought' about someone and saying it.  I know a comedy is fiction, but when presented as a 'sitcom' need a little more of a reality check.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|First of all, I had to return the product that I bought here because they shipped me the DVD version when I bought the blue ray and I bought it again at bestbuy, This collection is great. The digital enhancements done here are right down marvelous. Loved all three movies (Crystal Skull is bad so I don't watch it)
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I continue to buy the Jack Reacher books because of their consistency. This one is at least as good as the others and really pulls you along. Great read.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Thank you amazon prime for helping me expose my kids to this classic series. My 10 and 12 year old sons enjoyed watching this with me and I enjoyed watching again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and cannot wait to get into the next one. Every time I had to put the book down I couldn't wait until I could pick it back up and keep reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved it so much I did not stop playing I am glad my friend Jackson should me this game on he's Xbox 360
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|I have a limited familiarity with the comics, which comes mostly from friends that have been fans.  A big complaint about the 'other' film about this iconic character was that you saw his face.  No one sees Dredd's face.  I think the film captures the feel of the world and the character of Dredd very well.  Well worth watching.
1567184855|5.0|See my review of Destiny of Souls. This is a very good source of thought provoking  information. Get it now.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|One of my favorite books by Jane Austen.  Highly recommend this to those who enjoy reading her books.  Also recommend the movies that have been made from her stories.
B005K01VZS|5.0|outstanding could not put the book down. Made you think twice how you live your life and whats important to you
B000E5N6LG|5.0|One of Kevin Costner's movies, which is very true to the history of that time. A great performance by Gene Hackman, and the rest off the cast.  I highly recommend this western.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Great music for the holidays and a must for any Christmas music collector or collection. Now more the one edition available.
B003Y5D776|5.0|The product worked extremely well.  I have a new i Mac with no audio input and the iMic provided an input so that I could record some tapes from a cassette deck to the computer for me to burn onto CD.  I used a program called wavepad which worked well with the iMic.  Very satisfied with the iMic.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is a great read that gives readers quality exposure to the training and mission of the elite Navy SEALs.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I enjoy this game.  It is one of my favorite games that I like to play and relax with.  Helps focus with your eyes and contact.
B00C5ZORES|4.0|I like the entire CD, but it did not come with a warning for explicit language.  I will have to edit a few songs before it is ready for family consumption (drops an F-bomb in two songs).  A shame when talent feels they need to be vulgar.  Good thing I have free editing software.  It is worth the purchase.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This is a good simple calculator and it works great!  It serves it's purpose and it is very useful for math.
B007FLHW3K|4.0|Easy to install. I need to buy another set of lights to get the whole wheel to light up when rotating.  It's possible to make the whole wheel look like the pictures, but you gotta keep pedaling fast and I can't keep that pace for too long.
B00136NUG6|5.0|I enjoyed this group of artists who have been around and with me for a long time; it was very entertaining and make you want to sing and dance.  Like having it in my music collection. Great Music!
0756931800|5.0|I ordered this trilogy for my teenage son's birthday.  The order arrived packaged well and on time. He started reading right away and hasn't put the books down.  Highly recommend for teens.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|My 6-year old granddaughter can't stop playing this game:) Easy to play and understand for her age and she loves the challenge.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have shared  it with my husband (of 30 years) and recommended my daughter read it too.<br />Anyone can benefit from this practical easy to read book.<br />What a pity it isnt required reading for anybody considering marriage.<br />The benefits though 30 years down the track were great as well.
032147404X|5.0|Direct and accurate! Just do what Kelby says!<br />Excellente!<br />It's a guide, you will need to read several times!<br />Enjoy!
B003B96AOW|5.0|my kid loves it.<br />What can I say but it does what its suppose to.<br />no complaints on my side.<br />I would recommend to anyone....
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like th previous version better than this one.  if Itje previous version I will give five star.  this version include too many information that I don't need I only want to know the temperature and wind. cloudy or sunny that is it...and ..previous version more clear than this one
B008DYZKQE|4.0|I love the classic story, a great one. My favorite story by Robert Munsch. :) :) :)<br /><br />Love,<br />  Justin<3 <3
B007REV4YI|5.0|We enjoyed Skyfall very much.  Probably has the best explosion i've seen in a movie to date.  It shook the room and we have 6&#34; cement block walls and a cement tiles on concrete slab floor!<br />The special features were good too.  They put a lot of effort and heart into this anniversary edition movie.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Awesome, it is a great kids and adult movie, perfect family night popcorn and soda, funny and inspiring for the entire family
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Didn't have anything for a 6 year old boy to read, so went online and downloaded Diary of a Wimpy Kid to my Tablet.  My grandson actually spent more time reading the book then playing the games on my Tablet.  I plan on buying the rest of the series for him.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I thought this was a really good movie and quite unique in it's story line...I certainly think that those beginning a new time in their life after working for years will enjoy it.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Great series.  Gemma Arterton was lovely as always and did a great job in this role.  Ending was sad but well portrayed.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The most fun I've had reading science fiction in years. Andy Weir succeeded in bringing a sense of adventure to science fiction that I haven't seen since I was young in the days before Apollo 11 and read stories of what the first moon landings might be like. It had me from the first paragraph.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|This movie is going to become a classic-wonderfully made and portrayed. Glad that I bought my own copy to watch over and over.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|I got this sharpener because it was well reviewed and figured something this compact would be handy for a deep forest camp. First off, I know how to sharpen a blade, I am not an expert, but I have fine tuned a few edges in my life, this will not do that for you. The sharpener seems to cater to a very specifically shaped and sized blade in order to give it a proper V edge, otherwise it will not sharpen evenly and will most likely do more harm than good, as a buddy of mine discovered in our last outing. He was foolish and used it for the first time on a nice knife that was losing it's edge and it really did a bad number on the blade. The saving grace would be the diamond rod, it did a good job tuning up a serrated potion of my knife. I would only recommend using this for a touch up on a simple pocket knife or on an extremely dirty knife if your out in the field, but only as a last resort. NEVER use on a fine blade.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I don't know why this book was rated so high in the first place.  It was written very well though.  I feel like the author didn't quite finish working on all the characters' relationships.  There wasn't enough connection between the characters to convince me as a reader to follow along the events in the book.  It just felt unfinished.  It was very dull at certain moments of the book.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album is a must for metal and classical fans alike. Rock music's roots run even deeper than jazz - some genres, especially heavy metal, are strongly influenced by classic music. This album combines the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra with one of the most prominent bands in heavy metal. It's amazing enough to make metal fans out of symphony goers and classical fans out of metal heads. Not to be missed!
B0000WPADK|5.0|OUR SON HAD TO HAVE THIS ITEM FOR HIS COLLECTION.<br />HE IS VERY INTO THEM, AND THIS WAS A GRETA FIND FOR HIM!!<br />IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! 5 STARS!!!!!!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|THIS MOVIE AND TRUE STORY BROUGHT ME TO TEARS..<br />AND WAS VERY MOVING TO WATCH.. AND INTERESTING!<br />WAS A GREAT WATCH TOO.. AND OFFERS SO MUCH INSIGHT<br />A HIGH RECOMMEND!!
B00BWJ91XK|4.0|Really enjoyed this glad they decided to go back to the beginning. Glad they stuck with the original cast.  A pleasure to watch.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I've enjoyed all of the mission impossible films, but I really liked this one. Kinda ties with the first one. Any movie that shows off Tom's many many talents has my complete attention! Will watch over and over.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I was distracted from the story by the terrible choices these kids made.  The main character likes to get drunk and &#34;bang&#34; girls then rush them out of his apartment.  Why on earth would anyone find this attractive, especially when he does it when she is in the other room.  Also, the girl drinks 19 shots on her 19th birthday! This would likely end her up in the ER.  This reminded me of the dumbest of dumb people I knew in college.  The kind of kids most people made fun of, but they thought they were cool.
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|Gameplay is too arcade-style and extremely simplistic, far undermining what the game's ingenious concept could actually dish out. There is no story at all, and the tasks to the levels in the game become horribly repetitive with virtually no variation by the developers. It's saved by its incredible focus on graphical detail and realistic movement of the fish solely via tilt sensor; unfortunately, the music becomes rather lackadaisical after a while.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it and if you like horses then you will like it and it is a very good game

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book that everyone will find a way to relate to. Such an interesting perspective to view the world of high school. You will likely be surprised by how well you feel you know the main character by the end.
B009K72EP8|5.0|Season Five of the Clone Wars features some of the best Star Wars ever.  The Darth Maul arc was fantastic and went places I was not expecting.  The Ahsoka arc that wrapped up the season was intense.<br /><br />Let's hope Disney will change their mind and give this series a proper ending not just left over \\"bonus content.\\"  Reach out to Disney and let them know how much you love this show!  SaveTheCloneWars.com
B000NY12LO|5.0|Amazing book, I would recommend it to anyone! Classic example of how Jodi Picoult forces you to see all sides of any situation. You will likely be surprised by your feelings towards the characters. No doubt you'll be hooked only a few pages in!
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|This has been my favorite album since the very first time I heard it some 20yrs ago and even today this album is still my all time favorite album above all others.
B001Q5395Q|3.0|Sometimes a simple plot pays off. Not too difficult to follow and well directed when you think about the worst gore being up-side-down cotton candy cones with bodies inside.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The Investment points take too long to accumulate, but otherwise it is an enjoyable game. Credit points rack up quickly and power points are okay.
B001EIOOWC|4.0|I have seen the movie before, just looking for a reliable dvd with sharp picture and I got it Amazon.

6305265666|5.0|I own this on VHS, but wanted a &#34;back-up&#34; on a disc also. This is one of those movies that I watch over & over!!! LOVE IT!!!! &#60;3
B008602KQI|2.0|My grandson convinced me that we needed to watch this show so we did. I just don't think this is what kids need to be seeing in this day and age. It left me very unsettled. I know a lot of it was fantasy but the fact that it was kids killing kids for adult entertainment and the corrupt government was just a bit much for me with the events that have occurred in recent years and at yesterday's Boston Marathon.
B009EE70J2|5.0|George Clooney is at his best in a wonderful story about what it truly means to be a family -- highly recommended!
B00BAVCD8A|2.0|I keep reading reviews and interviews that suggest that Fall Out Boy has grown.  They've matured and their new music reflects that maturing process.  If growing and maturing means losing your edge, then yes, Fall Out Boy has grown and matured.  Save Rock and Roll does anything but.  It's a boring record with little to offer the Fall Out Boy fan.<br /><br />Fall Out Boy resorts to tactics on this new album that have become music industry cliches.  They invite Big Sean to add an unnecessary and uninspiring rap to \\"The Mighty Fall\\".  They bring Courtney Love in to sing (scream?) on \\"Rat a Tat\\" and they even have the extremely out of place Elton John provide vocals on \\"Save Rock and Roll\\".  The thing is, Fall Out Boy doesn't need these guest vocalists - they detract from the songs and appear as nothing more than a distraction. I know they've had guest vocalists on records before (Elvis Costello, Deborah Harry) but those vocals complimented the music where collaborating with these artists make Fall Out Boy appear desperate to add a \\"cool\\" factor to their music.  The thing is, before this record, THEY were their own cool factor.<br /><br />There is not one standout song on this record.  There is no \\"Thnks Fr Th Mmrs\\", no \\"Dance, Dance\\".  The closest we come on Save Rock and Roll is the lead single \\"My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light 'Em Up)\\" and that doesn't even reach the heights of \\"What a Catch, Donnie\\", \\"Sugar, We're Going Down\\" or \\"I Don't Care\\".<br /><br />Fall Out Boy has reunited and cut a record that not only abandons their cleverly long song titles, but it abandons their penchant for fun songs that instantly demand repeat listens.  Every Fall Out Boy album before this one is better than this one.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This is a great movie with many impassioned speeches from both sides of the aisles. Too bad our recent gun legislation didn't pass, also!
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|I enjoyed the way the author intertwined the incidents and characters in the setting. It felt like New York...I could picture it though I have spent only a short time there. There is a melancholy expressed......a loneliness but with some hope.  The human condition. ....all searching for meaning, purpose, love.
B000FA675C|5.0|One of da best books I have read!!! Itz a real page turner. It will capture u all da way to da end!!!
B0033PQUXA|3.0|Until the complete movie comes out on blu ray, avoid this purchase.  I purchased it thinking it was the 3 hour movie.<br /><br />The movie is one of the most amazing foreign movies you will ever see.  But cutting one hour to suit American tastes makes the story incomplete and just a good movie.  The complete version is completely amazing!!!<br /><br />2 hour version = 3 stars<br />3 hour version = 5+ stars
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I got hooked on this show when I was a teen.  It brings back a lot of memories.  I especially love &#34;City on the Edge of Forever.&#34;  Great show!
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|The production values are astonishing...visually, one of the best 3D movies I've seen. The story, however...well, let's put it this way: the LOTR was an 1,800-page trilogy. The movie editions were so long they caused bladder damage at the theater, but that was understandable because there was a LOT of storytelling to be done: Peter Jackson needed 9, 10, 12 hours (depending on which special edition you bought) to get the job done.<br /><br />The Hobbit, on the other hand, is a 250-page book assembled from JRRT's bedtime stories for his kids. It takes about three and a half hours for an adult to power through the pages. Round One of Jackson's vision took two hours and 45 minutes of screen time. What does this mean? While there are some fun sections--the race to escape the orc cavern is madness!--a significant amount of that sumptuous visual detail is vacuous fluff or--worse--stuff Peter Jackson flat-out made up.<br /><br />And there are two more films yet to go!  I will, eventually, buy this or the extended verion (!), but I'm not going to feel good about myself when I do.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Another testament to the great King of horror!  I didn't care for the ending much but the story line was the same show of brilliance the can only come from the master's mind…
B005FWO3QK|5.0|Music is phenomenal, I can't explain how much enyoiable is. Don't give up if you think that costums are poore at first, because it will be one of the thing's you'll love the most from this production. Amazing

B004J4WNL2|4.0|As someone who thought it necessary to extol the extrovert side of me I found comfort and solace with the genuine knowledge contained in this book.  I do not always have to play a starring role.  I can write tomorrows metamorphosis.  Every song does not need to be composed for the World.  I can take joy in a small group.  I recommend this book for all who seek for themselves and those who seek to understand others.
0425263916|5.0|How awesome is Gideon? Different than 50 Shades but similiar in the aspect of love. Cant wait for the 3rd book.

B000NIVJEU|5.0|I have adored this movie since the day it came out in the theatre and have been waiting and hoping for it to be available on blu-ray.  The special effects of this movie are enhanced by the blu-ray  technology, so it's a great buy on blu-ray.

B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying I have been a fan of literally everything this band has released. Officially, I often say the Strokes are my favorite band ever. Ranking their five albums as follows: (1) Room on Fire (2) Is This It? (3/4) First Impressions of Earth (3/4) Comedown Machine (5) Angles. With this new release I feel the Strokes have finally incorporated the influences of all its band members into the final product, and I really enjoyed it. I hear Nickel Eye, Little Joy, a little bit of Albert's band and obviously Mr. Casablancas' solo work has a heavy influence on this album. I left out Mr. Valensi, because that dude didn't join the rest in releasing \\"solo\\" material, but he continues to be incredible in my eyes.<br /><br /> In any case, back to \\"Comedown Machine.\\" In my opinion, this album stands alone. It is not as predictable at times and poppy as Angles; however, most of the songs could have easily been slapped on to the end of Angles as bonus tracks. Contradictory perhaps, but try and make sense of it. \\"Oneway Trigger\\" I feel is the only track if properly publicized could easily be a billboard hit single. It has that crossover potential and catchiness. The rest of the album does remind me of a lot of music currently in the indie music scene, but still very much fresh and enjoyable. Also, holy (expletive)! this falsetto rocked my world! Furthermore, if \\"take it or leave it\\" is one of your favorite Strokes songs check out the track \\"80's Comedown Machine.\\" It gives me goosebumps reminiscent of the Strokes of old..<br /><br />In the end, I would recommend this album to anyone that enjoys rock & roll music. One side note, if anyone that reads this happens to run into any of the Strokes plead them to continue making music together! This is the last album on their RCA deal, and for some it feels like this might be the end of the line for the band. To the Strokes: Put your egos aside, men! You've got something special here! Plus, New York City and the rest of the world need you. That's all I've got.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks:<br /><br />80's Comedown Machine, Welcome to Japan, Tap Out & every other song on the album. It really is good, people. Naturally, I'm not surprised. It's the Strokes after all!!!<br />Enjoy.est of the world need you. That's all I've got.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks:<br /><br />80's Comedown Machine, Welcome to Japan, Tap Out & every other song on the album. It really is good, people. Naturally, I'm not surprised. It's the Strokes after all!!!<br />Enjoy.

B004N6369Y|5.0|I love Danielle Steel books and this was no exception.  From the time I picked it up until I completed it, I was thoroughly enmeshed in the characters and what would happen to them.  At first, I wasn't sure where the book was going, but I soon was deeply involved with the young girl, who grows up in an environment unlike any I have ever known.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Some science fiction requires the reader to suspend disbelief, which is to say, set aside logic and common sense and real world experience because they don't apply here.<br /><br />Wool does not require this sacrifice; instead, it leads the reader on a curvy, twisty journey through a dystopian future when, apparently, all of humanity is dwelling below ground in The Silo, safe from the toxic, dead world above.<br /><br />Hugh Howey is not afraid to put us through the agony of pain, injury, and death, along with the joy of love and the exuberance of discovery.  He does not mince words.  This is a brutal world where the slightest misstep will get you banished aboveground where you quickly succumb to the elements--but not before cleaning the sensors that are the Silo's only window on the outside.<br /><br />Why do banished people even bother to clean the sensors?  How did the world get like that? Who built the massive Silo?  And are these people truly alone in the world?  You have to read nearly to the end to learn the answers, and even then you are left wondering about some things.  You are not left hanging, not in a bad way. But you have been given food for thought that will nourish your imagination for quite some time.<br /><br />Mr. Howey did a first rate job not only in writing this masterful work, but in bypassing the middleman and bringing a polished product straight to the reader.  He has proven that publishers can't and won't pick winners; they pick people who *look like* winners and hope for the best.  Thanks for your fine writing, Hugh, and also thanks for inspiring us would-be novelists that there is an alternate path to getting decent work out to the readers and \\"making it\\"!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I already knew I liked this movie but I am happy that I now own it on DVD.  No problems what so ever with the dvd.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Johnny Cash was one of those awesome, almost legendary figures that needs no introduction. He was Johnny Cash, the Man in Black. Nuff said.<br /><br />And you would think that no actor could adequately capture his mystique, but the ever-brilliant Joaquin Phoenix came pretty close in \\"Walk The Line.\\" The story of the first half of Cash's life runs through a lot of the typical tropes -- drugs, sex, hitting rock bottom, finding love -- but Phoenix's eerily perfect performance elevates it. And yes, he sings.<br /><br />The story begins in Cash's boyhood, which was marked by A) the open contempt of his alcoholic father, B) the shocking death of his brother, and C) his love of music. When he was grown, Cash (Phoenix) joined the Air Force and married his reluctant girlfriend Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin).<br /><br />But his love of music never died. Despite Vivian wanting him to get a \\"real job,\\" Cash successfully impressed a record executive with his gravelly voice and gritty songs -- and became a megastar with his very first album. While on tour, he encountered June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and was immediately smitten by her both professionally and personally.<br /><br />But his growing love for June quickly destroyed his marriage, and his increasing drug use seemed to be doing the same to his career -- even landing him in jail at one point. June stepped in to save him from his downward spiral, inspiring him to clean up his life and go back on the road -- even to Folsom Prison, where he had a lot of fans. But his true goal was her hand in marriage.<br /><br />\\"Walk the Line\\" has a rather rough task -- tell the life story of one of America's most beloved singers, warts and all, without diminishing any of what made him great. So yeah, there's adultery and drug use here, but it never blots out the wounded, romantic soul that walks the line in the center of it, tangled in barbed-wire issues.<br /><br />And the triumph of the film is Joaquin Phoenix, who gives a scarily perfect performance as Cash. His body language, his expressions, even his VOICE are all altered to be as close as possible to Cash's -- and yes, Phoenix sings Cash's songs. But what makes his performance great is not mere mimicry of Cash -- it's his ability to give a pitch-perfect imitation of Cash while also giving a powerful, heartfelt performance as an artistic soul covered in scars, who had to fight his way past everyone who doubted him.<br /><br />James Mangold focuses a lot on the shaping influences of Cash's life here, setting up his brother's horrific, bloody death as the place where his life changed.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|Very comfortable and amazing sound. These head phones are one hundred percent worth buying. I recommend these head phones to any one who plays video games
B000005IU2|5.0|Had to buy a second copy of this CD since my first one disappeared.  To paraphrase Henry Rollins, this \\"is the densest batch of jams . . .\\"  Proto-punk from the Chairman of the Bored.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As much as I wept at the conclusion, in my opinion  there could have been a fist full of pages containing tedious nonsense removed and the book would have been just as good if not better.
B004EPZ03E|5.0|This is a cute movie.  It's been done very well and my children enjoy the music and story.  Good purchase.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Great release from a long time favorite band!  I was not disappointed with this new release and just wish my town were included in this year's tour.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|We wanted to complete the series.  My son is a big action movie fan and he really enjoyed this movie in the theater so it was a must have for him.
B003G94BZC|5.0|BEEN A FAN SINCE THE FIRST DOCTOR. NEVER DISAPPOINTED. I WATCH EACH ONE OVER AND OVER. I CAN PICK UP SOMETHING EACH TIME I VIEW IT!
B00867GHS8|5.0|It just isn't a great collection of movies unless you add &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; into it.  We love this movie and this copy in blu-ray meets all are expectations.
0312330537|5.0|For those of us who live in a house with four walls, eat three square meals a day, go to work at the same job and try to progress our careers, look after our children and enjoy our family and friends, this book is a real eye-opener. I'm not often inspired by the worldviews of criminals - but this author is an exception.<br /><br />If you are prepared for some amazing and very emotional adventures, this is highly recommended. I'd give it ten stars if I could.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|We were looking forward to the release of this movie.  I'm always pleased when we can purchase new movies at a decent price like this one.  Thanks.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|played on fb and enjoy it.  the background sound bothers me.  I wish it was more like the game on fb.
B005H0IW76|5.0|I am so glad I purchased the limited edition.  The extra material added to an already great product.  I am pleased.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Ok, so it's not going to be perfectly accurate, it doesn't have a sapphire face, you can't wind it with the crown... but who cares? It's an attractive little automatic watch that will bring a smile to your face as you watch the second hand smoothly move around the dial. And it's not massively huge like other automatics at this price point. Quality is good, and with an upgraded band everyone would think you paid a lot more!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool has an interesting story line, and I love the main character. The little mysteries kept me turning the pages.  I found the book too wordy and in need of some good editing.  Portions of the book were way too technical, and I found myself skipping large portions of chapters.  We read this for book club, and the consensus was the same - a good edit will turn this into superb literature.  The characters are strong, and the story really is interesting.  I liked the new take on dystopic fiction.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I purchased this for my girlfriend.  We both liked the movie.  She thinks Chris Hemsworth is hot and we both like the action.  One of the better recent Marvel movies.
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|I bought this movie with great expectations after i saw how well it was treated by the media and critics, I mean the main character was nominated for an Oscar!! But to my dismay the time line made absolutely no sense, they jumped 2 or 3 years at a time, what happened in between??  So no, definitely not impressed with the story line or even the acting, don't even know why she was nominated but now I know why she didn't win it.
B0045HCJIA|4.0|Classic movie with a lot of truth to it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes either the classics or conspiracy movies. Very good buy and high quality to boot.
B002RVCD6O|3.0|I agree with many reviewers that the movie was a faint imitation of a great book.  While the books themselves get darker in theme,the dark and oppressive atmosphere of the movie  and the lackluster recreation of some of the events in the book made for a mediocre and one dimensional viewing experience.
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|This movie is very moving and is based on a true story. The family shows strength and endurance during a tsunami. The filming of it is unbelievable. It is worth the purchase.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Best app i've got so far! Does everything it claims to :D i'm not the best at 'selfies' but have got a few to be proud of via this app, if i do say so myself :) would highly recommend if you just want a quick and easy app to enhance your photos
B001NHNG64|5.0|Outstanding read. This was an excellent story and I was amazed at the imagination and storytelling ability of this author. I will read them all now!
0307744434|4.0|The condition of the book though described as used with some wear it was in excellent condition and far exceeded my expectations.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a  movive with a real story line and with a young female protagonist!  A good movie for tweens/teens.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Chose this book for a book club read!  Loving it and now have seen the movie which is equally spectacular..
B0098460O4|5.0|I love their singing.  And I loved the story behind, their success.  I was super happy to get this cd/
B000LW7OWE|5.0|i seen this in the movie theatre when it came out and I have seen the directors cut. this is the original no added beach scene with ray and jim. about time the original in this case is better
B000002MIY|2.0|yep, I bought it knowing I did not like it with the exception of &#34;tomorrow's girls&#34; which is a fagen classic.  I have a serious audiophile sound system and can tell the difference between cd's and mp3's--yes, Virginia, there is one.  I had a copy from when it originally was released but in moving and such it has gone by the way.  probably find it tonight.
B000J670ZI|5.0|What can i say both Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant make this movie, so funny i have watched this movie over the years and still love it.lots of great movies to watch on Amazon.
B000002GW5|5.0|Jackson has some good lp's but this one may be the best--one of at least.  when recorded it was a totally new concept.  sort of a live/studio lp.  we went to see Jackson touring behind this album and he was fantastic.  he was also vulnerable and candid and bruised from his wife's suicide and the title reflects his driving around the city and no remembering to fill the tank he was so distracted.  he pretty much put it right out there &#34;heart on my sleeve&#34; and while I sympathized I also liked him for his courage.<br /><br />always chuckled at &#34;rosie&#34;--maybe juvenile but I liked it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My 5 year old started playing this game after the Mrs downloaded it for free. SO addictive but educational for the young one's especially if they've watched Dinosaur Train on Tv. Great graphics! We haven't spent a dime on it which just means it'll take longer to acquire money. Highly recommend it.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I didn't want to set it down. I also liked this book because I'm an christian, and it didn't have bad<br />language.It also had a surprise ending.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|great if you're in the mood to watch a couple fight for two hours. not funny, too long, it made me not like paul rudd and i didn't think that was possible. so thanks.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|It's about time Jack met his match. It figures it would be a chick who was also a military cop in the marines. He won't be complaining though if you know what I mean.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I'm finding that I prefer these serial shows to movies, with more time for the character to develop and opportunities to explore their relationships with others.  In spite of my strong recommendation, the funny episode in the middle where Dexter takes off was complete waste of time for me.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I'm 1/2 way thru it now---and have put it away for a while------LATER-------I had been looking forward to this book---but now find it hard to stay interesting  !
B005F82X48|5.0|A year ago I had no idea this band exist, now I love them. I love this album - it's just perfect. Love the mix of punk and some metal/hard rock influences.<br /><br />They make me think of a mix of paramore and fireflight, which are both bands I like, but I like this combination possibly more. Really, truly, great music.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Both the video and the sound on this BluRay are state-of-the art. The colors are really true, and are a little bit darker than they were in the previous DVD release (as can be seen when you watch the extra features which were produced for the earlier DVD release and feature color that has been \\"corrected\\" into a brighter, more-pastel-ish look). The outlines of the animated characters are also sharper in this BD release than in previous issues.<br /><br />The extra features in this set are substantial and very interesting. I won't discuss them here, but I will say that you're really missing out if you've purchased this combo set and don't avail yourself of watching the extras.<br /><br />A great release from Disney.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Needed more detail, better description and explanation of author's experience afterlife experience.  I would have liked to know what his interpretation of the events meant to him.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|This is the first Spock's Beard album since drummer/vocalist Nick D'Virgilio departed and was replaced by touring drummer Jimmy Keegan and Enchant vocalist Ted Leonard. I'd never completely warmed to the albums with D'Virgilio as lead singer - while their songwriting gradually improved I never really felt he was the right singer. This new incarnation is off to a very promising start though. While I don't think Keegan is as creative as D'Virgilio, he's still a very competent drummer. The big improvement comes from Ted Leonard though - I think he's a much more versatile and dynamic singer. At times he manages to sound a lot like D'Virgilio, at other times like original singer Neal Morse, and still other times shows his own sound.<br /><br />The songs themselves are consistently good, with a mix of proggy and catchy moments. I frequently found myself singing along with some of the tracks, particularly Something Very Strange and Treasure Abandoned. The album also features the return of Neal Morse in a songwriting role on 2 tracks, which sound very much like classic Spock's Beard.<br /><br />If you are able to get the Limited Edition, it's very worthwhile. The extra songs are not throwaways and hold their own with the \\"main\\" album; Wish I Were Here also has a welcome return of some of the humour that characterized their early albums. Overall the sound of the album is very distinctly Spock's Beard and should be enjoyed by fans of the band as well as those who like Genesis/Yes influenced prog.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really love this story because it keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is something that can happen and it touches so many lives whether it is the the romance, the friendship, or the tragedy you can relate to. It helps knowing your are not the only one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Lots of fun games to keep my daughter occupied! I especially like the &quot;storybook&quot; interaction while the game is in process.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I typically despise this kind of stuff.  But I have two pre-teen girls and stuck it out...ya know, took one for the Team.  This was actually pretty good!  I don't know, maybe I'm getting soft.  Enjoy!!
B007TK77QE|5.0|A skilful novel which may shock many, but for those of us who have worked with a broad cross-section of people, and have lived in country towns, there are no shocks or surprises. This work describes the society we live in, the good, the bad and the ugly are revealed, and the reality, the motives, the vanities, and a wealth of other human failings are revealed and offered up or consideration.<br />I really found the book hard to get into as the initial chapters describe in detail all the characters, with very little story line to go on, but in hind sight, this had to happen. In towns where everyone thinks they know everyone else, all the petty little details are important in the workings & interactions of the community. We are forced to become as judgemental as the characters themselves, as their failings, petty jealousies and selfishness are exposed.<br />There are some pretty awful examples of parents on parade, and maybe that's another example of a fundamental failing in our society. We see examples like this all the time.<br />A reality check? I think so, and I'll quote Tess's thoughts on judging the lives of others:<br />\\"You must accept the reality of other people.  You think that reality is up for negotiation, that we think it's whatever you say it is.  You must accept that we are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not God.\\"<br />It's not Harry Potter, but a great read nonetheless :-)
1442444053|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter when I discovered that she had never read it and because I loved it the first time I read it years ago. It is one of those books that can captivate gradeschoolers to senior citizens. I plan to read it again. It will be one of those books that I re-read every year. The book itself is of high quality and beautiful to hold and look at. Kindle does not do justice to a book like this.
B0045HCJT4|2.0|All great fan of Kurt Russell as I am, I still hated this film and I hardly managed to finish watching it. This review doesn't contain spoilers, as there is hardly anything to spoil in this disaster...<br /><br />In a near future an evil (of course!) militaristic US government, controlled (of course!) by evil greedy corporations willing (of course!) to deprive common people of everything they have, creates a military unit composed with abducted children, who are raised to become sociopathic killers - they are supposedly the best fighting force ever. This is an incredibly stupid idea by the way, NEVER tried by any armed forces in any country - little advice here to scenario writers: in reality sociopaths are unable to follow orders and cooperate and therefore make always the WORST possible soldiers! Then, at one moment, one of those soldiers becomes damaged, is declared obsolete and is dumped with other garbage on an enormous junkyard on a remote planet. There, he is taken in charge by a band of people hiding from authorities and scavenging for scraps amongst the military refuse...<br /><br />The initial idea of a battle scarred, emotionally damaged veteran receiving a second chance in life by joining a community of ultimate underdogs was really GREAT! Producers secured also a good cast for this film, by bringing on board Kurt Russell, Gary Busey, Connie Nielsen, to name just those three. The budget was also generous - in 1998 60 millions bucks was a lot of money...<br /><br />However, to direct the film somebody picked up Paul W.S. Anderson, a young man who at that time made only three films: \\"Shopping\\" (which nobody noticed), \\"Mortal Kombat\\", which was (for my personal taste) a huge disappointment (even if it made a lot of money) and finally \\"Event Horizon\\", one of the absolutely WORST SF films I ever saw... Therefore, it is not a big surprise, that \\"Soldier\\" was a disaster waiting to happen... And it happened - for once, a really BAD big budget movie lost also a lot of money, as few people went to see it, hearing the HORRIBLE word of mouth raging all around.<br /><br />Paul W.S. Anderson redeemed himself a little later, by making \\"Alien vs. Predator\\" (a film which certainly is not a masterpiece, but which I always kinda liked) and especially the very, very good \\"Pandorum\\" (see my reviews of both of those films); it seems also that \\"Resident Evil\\" franchise is not bad - but here I can not say, as I didn't see any of those films. But I digress...<br /><br />My problem with this film is the total absence of scenario - like in \\"Event Horizon\\", absolutely nothing makes sense. From the beginning to the end it is so boring that I had to fast forward parts of it. Dialogs are inexistent and actors as good as Kurt Russell, Connie Nielsen and Gary Busey are not allowed to act. At all. Action scenes are ridiculous, people keep doing stupid things without ever stopping to think and the ending is really just a lame opening to a possible sequel - which, thanks God, will never be made.<br /><br />So why two stars? Well, to be absolutely clear, this is a ONE STAR film, but by stretching my more merciful side to the maximum, I managed to scrap some small pieces to combine them together in a second star:<br /><br />- 1/2 of a star for presence of Connie Nielsen; she is not allowed to actually act in this film (nobody is) but her simple presence allowing us to contemplate her magnificent beauty (shining brightly even when she wears dirty rags) is certainly one of the very few positive things in this film<br /><br />- 1/4 of a star for Michael Chiklis - seeing the future Vic Mackey with some hair still attached is always a pleasure - and also honestly, how could I not like him playing a character named Jimmy Pig? (A huge LOL here...)))!) But his screen time is short<br /><br />- 1/4 of a star for ONE image from the film, figuring prominently on the DVD cover. Whoever decided to dump the mighty (albeit still conventionally propelled) aircraft-carrier USS \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt\\" (CV-42), usually referred to by her crew as \\"Swanky Franky\\" or \\"Rusty Rosie\\", on a military junkyard on another planet deserved definitely a rise and a cookie...))) That was really a great idea and I loved this picture instantly from the moment I saw it. Be advised however, that in the real life USS \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt\\", commissioned in 1945, was retired in 1977 and scrapped soon after, in 1978, by River Terminal Development Company in Kearny, New Jersey, a pretty alien destination by itself, if most of New Yorkers are to be believed...)))<br /><br />So bottom line, this is a VERY BAD movie, which had a great potential - but all of which was cruelly wasted. I hated this film, it bored me almost to death, I had to fast forward parts of it and I gave it away for a charity sale immediately after. Avoid it with an astronomical level of determination.rier USS \\"Franklin D.

0345529057|2.0|Books are poor quality and the print is way too small. I will have to use a magnifier. Also, pages are falling out. I was really disappointed with this purchase. I will probably give the set away, if I can find somebody who can read the small print.
0345803485|5.0|I read this for a book discussion group. I could not put it down.I was the only one in our group to finish all three books. Read it with an open mind, but read it before judging.<br />  I will admitt that most of book one sounded like people in their young twenties. If anything I read more graphic and sexually explicit material in The Original Joy of Sex.<br />  I went on a read the second book because the last page of this book leaves you thinking you should turn to the next page, because you just know......
B004UJAOLM|5.0|The despicable characters made me almost dislike this book until the final few chapters. The passion is disguised as cruelty as the love affair unwinds in tragic events upon more tragedies! As much as I hate the characters I equally love the book...
0345803507|5.0|I read all three.Hoping she writes his side of the story. Only has to be one book as it will be told by a male. We all know they are about the doing,NOT the Talking.<br /> If you went to the effort of reading the first two books, you might as well finish the series.<br />I disagree with those who think this is an sbusive relationship. Ana herself says she enjoys the \\"kinkiness\\" of the relationship, and as for control...<br />Christian is right. She HAS ALL the control. Over the staff, the security team, her husband, the world.<br />His little sister is definatly in need of turning over and giving a good spanking. And not the kind that Ana & Christian indulge in. Everytime you turned a new chapter where Mia was, there was some sort of trouble.In the end she nearly gets Ana, Blip, and herself killed.<br />I'm just thankful that two years later Ana & Christian are still married and keeping each other happy. If more spouses just did half the things the other spouse likes to do occassionally, they'd still be married fifty years later.<br />Can't wait to see if we get a tell all from his side.Lets call it:Fifty shades of Caught
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|Because I love her singing and was missing her.  I bought because it has my favorite songs on this CD.
0345803493|5.0|As I said as I ended the review I posted at the end of Fifty Shades of Grey, I felt that it had been cropped to fit a publisher deadline, and it need to be the next chapter. It did not fail me in that sense. And Christian does come to the realization if you love someone you have to do what that person wants too.<br /> I don't know many 21 year olds who don't go through the feelings that Anastasia goes through. Christian is a Megalaomaniac. He has good reasons. Ana is like most of us. Nice,middle class home.She does not realize that she looks good, could have a vengful ex boss, or stalker.If I was Christian I'd have had a small stroke at some of the things she does that nearly gets her killed.<br />  I might just enjoy this series,because I spend everyday with young people this age.<br /> And really; How many of us did not think that we could not please the person we were in Love with at that age?
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|every bit as entertaining, emotional, and touching as any of the broadway productions............seeing the actors up close and personal during their most dramatic moments made the entire movie much more personal............it was great; have now purchased copies (through you) for all the family)

B00AMBH70S|3.0|This movie wasn't quite what were expecting. It was a bit to conspiracy theory for my tastes. When there was action, it was good. But there were some long drawn out parts that made the movie drag.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Very suspenseful - had you guessing until the very end.  The actors were outstanding and I could see why they got so many awards...

B002SSUQFG|5.0|Oh my god.. this watch is totally unbelievable.. In this case, the old saying of \\" you get what you paid for \\" doesn't apply to this excellent quality watch. I like to wear watch and I like to collect watch. I have rado, omega, tag, seiko kinetic, timex, some German-made watch... and you name it. By far this is the best value and quality you can get for $50+ dollar. I was very skeptical of this watch when I look at the price and movement. My best friend came to me the other day and asked me what kind of watch he should be getting in terms of value and quality. Based on the review, I recommend this one and at the same time, I order one for myself as well LOL.. I warned my friend what to expect with automatic movement as he had no previous experience of automatic watch. I told him seriously :\\" you should expect 1 min loss or gain on this cheap automatic watch given the price point.\\" And my explanation carried on ..blah.blah The thing with automatic watch is it has so much historical value in comparison to quart watch. Good mechanical watch can last generations if you take care of it. The design is plain and simple which I really like. Hey ..what make Rolex is a success is its simple and unchanged design in ever-changing environment. Simplicity is beauty because I can still see my watch clearly when I'm 90 years old LOL.. In aggregate, it's not only decoration on your wrist and it's also ever-lasting tool. The accuracy still leave me in doubt if this is quartz  watch because I only loss few second after a week of wearing. Unbelievable and absolutely unbelievable. I bought a lot of stuffs on Amazon but never bother to write a review because I'm lazy. Nevertheless I told myself I have to write something about this watch because it's well deserved of Kudos..<br />+ accuracy<br />+ automatic movement ( I love it)<br />+ simple design ( I love it and I like it)<br />+ readability ( I love it and this thing glows beautifully in darkness haha)<br />+ hardex mineral ( I know it's not saphire but come on $50 bucks still give some kind of scratch resistance / what a deal)<br /><br />The only one shortcoming I can think of is the size of the watch.. 38mm seems to be a bit smaller, especially in today's world where the big face watch dominate the world.. But again the $50+ price remind me I can't expect too much from such high quality watch..<br /><br />Buy it today and enjoy it like me..

B004LROUW2|2.0|While this book had a great story line, the descriptions were repetitive, describing the same details and the same characters over and over again, especially the last third of the book. The fluidity of the book is interrupted by events that have already been written elsewhere and I found myself skipping whole pages just out of sheer boredom, and yet anticipation of what was about to come...a page turner for all the wrong reasons.
0307887898|5.0|I received this book maybe a year ago, and it has been on my shelf.  Well, now we're looking at starting our own business, so I pulled it out.  So glad I did--only wish I had read it when I got it.  This is totally changing our business plan and how we plan to go forward.  I took some classes in Entrepreneurship back in B-school, no doubt this will be on the list of books in b-schools these days.  I'd really like to see this brought to high schools and colleges, to encourage more young people to become their own employer, rather than looking for a job.<br /><br />Short, sweet, and actionable--great book.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|The Amazon Basics line fills a need for good quality audio linkage products at a decent price point. These banana plugs are no exception. The 24 pack contains enough plugs to last a decade or so. The plugs are sturdy and well made. Nothing complicated about wiring, just insert and twist. I doubled over the speaker wire to get more exposure. (Don't leave wire just hanging out.) The plug went in with a solid snap, requiring a bit of pressure to go in 100%. Enough of the speaker wire goes into the shell that it's quite unlikely it'll crimp, as sometimes happens with these. Plus, the 12x12 presentation of the plugs in the little cases looks way cool. Even if you're not a fan of banana plugs, these are worth a try.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|This movie was so ON POINT! My wife and I laughed histerically throughout the movie. If you want a funny movie that you don't have to think very hard to watch...this is it.

B0030Y11XS|3.0|There is a lot of convincing material in all of Moore's work.  This one is no different.  While I preferred \\"Sicko\\", this takedown of America's Corporate culture that masks itself as capitalism, is amazing and eye-opening.  It may be the least convincing of his films, but everyone will learn something from watching it, and even if you are not completely sold on the message you will probably walk away with a healthy dose of skepticism for some of the corporate BS that is fed our way. Regardless of your political views - Moore let's everyone have it in this film.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Should be in every middle school. Simple and honest book about life and feelings. Very touching.  Easy read for any age. Loved it.
1476715904|5.0|Nothing has been the same for Layken in the nine months since her dad's death.  Now, after her mom realizes she cannot handle all the bills by herself, they are moving to Michigan.  Though understanding her mom's motives, she is still more than a little miffed about having to leave behind the only home she has ever know to go through a senior year at a brand new school.  But when they arrive, she meets her sexy neighbor boy and they go on a spectacular date.  Things start looking up...until they get slammed with an unavoidable truth.<br /><br />Lake was a character I loved...most of the time.  There were several moments where she spirals down to childish, immature levels that make me wonder what Will sees in her, but for the most part, she's amazing.  She's smart and loyal and still grieving her dad, but trying to stay strong for her mom and little brother.  With all the s*** that gets thrown at her in this book, I'm surprise she made no serious suicide attempts, but she just keeps going out, only have the momentary lapse into depression, which is beyond understandable.<br /><br />My feeling for Will are similar to those I have for Lake, I loved him most of the time.  There were several moments where he is overcome by his emotions and does things he shouldn't and leads Lake on a bit without really meaning to.  The difference is that I completely sympathize with him because I probably would handle the situation exactly the same way.<br /><br />Then there are my two overall favorite characters, Kel and Eddie.  Kel is Lake's little brother, who has all the enthusiasm any child that age should have and he won over my heart pretty quickly.  Eddie, on the other hand, is the girl that quickly becomes Lake's best friend.  Quirky and spunky, Eddie will have you wanting to know more about her crazy past while you root for her and Gabe to live happily ever after.<br /><br />The writing has that amazing quality that just sucks you in after you get about 50 or so pages in.  It's impossible to stop reading because you want to know if Lake and Will are going to work something out, how Lake takes all the things coming her way, and if this is all going to end as happily as you have been wishing for.  It really does though and I couldn't be more excited to read the sequel.  I think anyone who likes contemporary YA or NA should give this a try.  It's amazing and I recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />On a quick side note, this is the first book I've ever listened to on an audiobook....okay okay, the first one was actually Obsidian, but this is the first but I have never read before that I listened and I have to say that I'm now in love with the concept.  I have always been opposed to audiobooks in general.  It just felt like a lazy way to read and I still gave it a try last year, listening to part of Crossed by Ally Condie and immediately felt redeemed in my opinion because that read had the worst monotone ever.  Her reading put me to sleep and I didn't want to try again.  But I did.  And It. Is. The. Best. Thing. Ever.  Seriously.  I can \\"read\\" while doing other things that I have to do like clean or do shower or exercise.  It's like reading for lazy people and I now know that a good reader makes all the difference.  The one I listened to was narrated by Heidi Baker and she was great.  If you are skeptical about audiobooks, give them a try.  Seriously, what do you have to lose?!?!?use you want to know if Lake and Will are going to work something out, how Lake takes all the things coming her way, and if this is all going to end as happily as you have been wishing for.

B002GHIPYI|4.0|Let's get the obvious out of the way first. The price of these makes them affordable and attainable by just about everyone.<br /><br />As many others have already said, the sound quality is very, very good. I was pleasantly surprised at the details produced by the HD-681's as well as the way they handle every type of music I tried.<br /><br />The amount of bass is excellent. The entire range of the sound spectrum is here because these headphones are only going to give you what you run through them.<br /><br />My library was setup with lossless WAV files, so I'm hearing all the original recordings have to offer.<br /><br />Bad recordings sound bad, and good recordings sound amazing.<br /><br />The downsides are that the HD-681's don't fold up at all. These aren't suited to be used outside of the home.<br /><br />The looks aren't the greatest, but the sound is what is important. The high notes are bright and fatiguing on certain recordings, but not all. This isn't a blanket statement because the HD-681's perform very well as \\"studio monitors.\\" They reproduce the sound accurately.<br /><br />It looks like the pads might have a short life span. If there is a set a velour pads out there that fits these, I'd purchase them immediately.<br /><br />The pleather / vinyl generates a lot of heat; more heat than any other headphones I own.<br /><br />Being a somewhat \\"open\\" design, there isn't a whole lot of noise isolation for you and others can hear what you are listening to as well.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad I took a chance on these. I'm extremely happy with the build quality and the sound quality.<br /><br />This is an easy decision, but my opinion is very subjective. Take it with a grain of salt and try to decide if these are right for you.

B002NT3B52|5.0|I purchased this book from Amazon I enjoyed the book very much. The author weaves a beautiful, loving, and sometimes very poignant story of her own relationship between herself and her beloved dogs throughout the book, while at the same time sharing with the reader her vast knowledge of dogs which makes for a nice combination.

B000001EUL|1.0|This c.d was nothing but a plain copied c.d., and didn't even come w/ a jewell case. I've been duped!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|We got hooked on Season 1 and then had the painful wait until Season 2 was complete.  We raced through the 10 episodes and now we've got the same problem with Season 3!  The show's plots are complex as are their characters.  The scenery and costumes are of the highest quality.  Sex and bloodshed are frequent themes that drive &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;.  They have created an amazing fantasy world that just sucks you in.  With every episode we ask the question &#34;Is this when Joffrey gets it&#34;?<br /><br />The beauty of purchasing the stream through Amazon is that you can watch it at your leisure instead of having to wait a week for the next episode.  What usually happens is that we watch two episodes back to back and before you know it, they're all gone!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A very pfagmatic and actionable book.  Very sensible without psycho-babble.  Highly recommend for anyone with a sincere to make your marriage stronger and more fulfilling.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|I put this guy in my camping bag on a longer camp trip.  Overall, I have several sharpeners but they're relatively big, so I went with this little guy to conserve space.  I sat down by the fire one night and gave it a try.  I'm happy with this item, don't get me wrong, but probably won't be my go to on a knife I love.  The pop open file is really good for those serrated sections, and the top should give you two options by which to sharpen your straight blades as shown in the description, but you get what you pay for.  I see some serious chipping happening with misuse and with the quality of this guy, misuse is really easy.<br /><br />If I were in a survival situation and this is all I had, I would absolutely take it.  Since I'm not, this won't be my first grab.  I'll go with a smoother pocket sharpening stone.

B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I found this book to be hard to even think of reading.  The language did not need to have so many swear words.  The<br />early part of the book made no sense to me as I was reading it primarily to read about her time with SNL and how she<br />got there, and was expecting some very funny reading.<br />Sorry I can not be positive.

B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Can only play a few games at a time and the Facebook log on is not working so I can play with friends.
B004UJTG6Q|2.0|I know this is a classic. I know Mark Twain is supposed to be an American treasure--but I just don't see it. The story is slow, the language is long outdated, and the characters reflect an age long past. Sure, some of the concerns of youth from 140 years ago still persist, but not many. This book was just too far outside of my experiences and too slow to hold my interest, although I feel chagrin in saying this.

0788859544|5.0|With the new two-disc platinum edition of this beloved classic out for sale, why not brush up on a little history? Based on the traditional Hans Christian Anderson tale, Walt Disney Feature Animation released their film adaptation of The Little Mermaid on November 14, 1989 to positive reviews. The movie drew in $84 million during its initial opening and earned $211 million in total lifetime gross. This movie is considered the first of a period known as the Disney Renaissance, which would soon usher in other blockbusters like The Lion King, Aladdin, and Hercules.<br /><br />Jodi Benson was cast in the lead voice of Ariel during the film's earliest stages of production. Although Benson was primarily a stage actress up to this point, Disney selected her because director Rom Clements felt it was critical that Ariel's speaking and singing voice be recorded by the same person, which was not customary of Disney productions. Christopher Barnes was cast as the charming Prince Eric, and Pat Carroll voiced the notorious sea witch Ursula.<br /><br />The inspiration for this film rests in an old copy of Christian Anderson's fables that Rom Clements stumbled upon shortly after The Great Mouse Detective's release. He immediately wrote up a two-page proposal for Disney CEO Mike Eisner, who accepted the idea warmly. John Musker, Clement's co-director on The Great Mouse Detective, wrote a twenty-page outline that was quickly approved for a storyboard.<br /><br />Glen Keanne and Mark Henn were assigned to oversee the animation of Ariel. According to Keanne, Ariel's body is based on Alyssa Milano from Who's the Boss? while her underwater characteristics derive from American astronaut Sally Ride's movements in space. Keane was also originally assigned to design the creation of the villain Ursula, who was based off a drag performer named Divine. The character was drawn to align with the voice of Bea Arthur from the Golden Girls, but Arthur turned down the part. Other minor characters like Sebastian and King Triton were each allotted their own artist for creation and animation.<br /><br />While animation and storyboard were in the primary stages of development, a group of highly skilled musicians were brought together. Acclaimed off-Broadway writer Howard Ashman teamed up with composer Alan Menken to create a Broadway-styled musical score that would highlight the plot through memorable musical numbers. Ashman is largely possible for the reggae undertones that are present throughout the film, as it was his idea to change the servant Sebastian to Jamaican descent as opposed to English.<br /><br />More money was spent on producing The Little Mermaid than any other previous Disney film, due largely in part to the opening of a satellite feature animation facility in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The studio's first projects include a Roger Rabbit cartoon short, in addition to hosting the major production behind The Little Mermaid.<br /><br />In order to capture the essence of being underwater, Disney would have to utilize a vast amount of special effects that hadn't been used since Fantasia in 1940. Mark Dindal, head of special effects, estimated that over one million bubbles were drawn. Other techniques like airbrushing, backlighting, superimposition, and minimal computer animation were also used to create a convincing underwater wonderland.<br /><br />Although minimal computer animation was used, The Little Mermaid was the last Disney feature animation to use hand-painted cells, which had previously been used for all films. Immediately following the movie's release, Disney would begin using a Pixar-created software, Computer Animation Painting System (CAPS,) for digital coloring and scanning multiple images together.<br /><br />Another unique tactic used for the creation of this film was using live action models to animate character motion. This practice was common in the 1940s and 1950s under the supervision of Walt Disney for films like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. Sherri Lynn Stoner of the Los Angele's Groundlings improvisation comedy group was chosen to exaggerate Ariel's motions during key scenes, which animators could replay at a later time to capture lifelike motion.<br /><br />The Little Mermaid is a critical component of Disney animation history for several reasons. First, The Little Mermaid was the first animated fairy tale since Sleeping Beauty in 1959, proving that contemporary audiences were receptive to that story-telling medium. Second, this film assured Disney that feature animations were a profitable venue again. For years before The Little Mermaid's release, Disney's profit relied heavily on theme park and merchandise revenue.<br /><br />In January of 1990, The Little Mermaid's success was put to the ultimate test, the Academy Awards. The film won two Oscars, for best song (\\"Under the Sea\\") and best musical score. The Little Mermaid was the first Disney film to win an Academy Award since The Rescuers in 1977.<br /><br />In addition to success at the Oscars, the film also received two awards at the 1990 Grammys. The film won Best Album for Children and Best Soundtrack for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media. In 1990, the soundtrack sold two million copies worldwide, an unprecedented sales record for an animated soundtrack at that time. Since then, The Little Mermaid soundtrack has been certified six-time platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.<br /><br />However, not long after the film's release controversy arose. Consumers claimed that on the cover image, hidden among the turrets of King Triton's castle, was an alleged penis. Disney denied these claims, insisting that any similarity to the male genitalia was completely coincidental. The cover artists apologized for the mishap, blaming it on a late-night rush to finish the cover art before its first release. The image does not appear on the cover art for the film's second release.<br /><br />Another controversy arose when a woman from Arkansas claimed that the priest officiating the wedding ceremony at the end of the film can be seen with an erection. The image is extremely small and difficult to distinguish. The woman sued The Walt Disney Company in 1995 but dropped the lawsuit two months later.<br /><br />While nearly all Disney fans are familiar with this princess classic, few people realize how groundbreaking and revolutionary The Little Mermaid was in reestablishing The Walt Disney Company's presence in cartoon animation. By initiating an era of success known as the Disney Renaissance, this film will go down in history both in animation and in the hearts of avid Disney-lovers.eeping Beauty.

B00BESM14U|5.0|Anyone can find it in themselves to relate to this specific book. The character's are so captivating and they keep you wanting more. Everyone has a low point in their life and this book can relate to that. I loved everything about this story. By the end of it, you want to be Charlie's best friend.

B005LAIIGC|5.0|I thought it was really cool that the hopping eggs came with the movie...and at the same price as it would have without them! Would do business with this seller again!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Fast paced, fun read with twists and turns in the plot that keep you reading. Good novel for vacation reading.
B0081BU42O|3.0|It's the journey, not the destination with this novel. A slow starter gets moving once the implacable, and suitably awesome Culture ships get involved. The plot doesn't really matter as much as you'd think because like all Culture novels, we're just glimpsing a tiny spec of their world. Sit back and enjoy the set-piece descriptions of majestic worlds and alien life, that isn't that alien after all.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|I gave this to my 13 year old son & He loved it. The rapid fire action & lots of included darts kept him busy for hours. Really, the only draw back is that it is a really noisy toy, but when its shooting time, that hardly matters.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters are wonderfully cast.  Maggie Smith with her smirks and humor is delightful.  We are anxious for each episode to watch this terrific story unfold.
1400069742|5.0|As in &#34;Troublesome Young Men&#34; and &#34;Citizens of London,&#34; Lynne Olson has again leavened and illuminated history with fascinating studies of the personalities involved to create a &#34;page-turner&#34; as intriguing and suspenseful as a gripping novel and ultimately as poignant and tragic as literature for some of the characters. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor relegated the political fight over whether the United States should join Britain's desperate battle with Hitler's Germany to a few pages or mere paragraphs in the survey histories.  But it is a fight worth revisiting for the psychic rewards of learning more about our history, whatever the lessons of this prelude to America's entry into  World War II might be.  The author's &#34;Troublesome Young Men&#34; was worthy of a Masterpiece Theatre series.  &#34;Citizens of London&#34; and &#34;Those Angry Days&#34; could easily provide material for Seasons Two and Three, with more and more significant drama than the domestic travails of &#34;Downton Abbey.&#34;
B000FA675C|5.0|It was excellent!  One of the best books I have read.  It gave you an idea about what goes on in the catholic church.  It is a novel so I don't understand all of the controversy.  People can't just be entertained.  It always amazes me that authors can come up with these different stories.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It rocks like an earthquake. So easy to understand. Simple but genius!!!!!!! Great for beginners and checking your answers. Get it!!!!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I am a big fan of the Honorverse and the series.  This is the 2nd of the series and it is a worthy sequel to the opening novel.  A strong, I mean both physically and mentally strong female character who has her own admirable code of ethics is really refreshing.  Similar to some of Anne McCaffrey's characters (Pern) who is empathically linked to a another creature (another excellent creation), but has enough differences to keep you coming back to see what they will be faced with the next time.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|LOVED IT! Couldn't put it down the ending was okay but all the way through it was amazing !!!  It  was totally worth money

1590171993|5.0|Mr. Woods, the other day you sent me an article entitled: 'College and University Faculty: what is it like to be denied tenure as a professor?', and you attached a web thread of comments from a few academics.  At first this came a bit as a surprise as I have yet to set foot on a college campus here, or overseas (barring a brief visit to NYU for a book party where as usual you nearly made me fall off my chair laughing, with one of your wonderful and humorous monologues).  But after giving it some thought, I believe I understand why you went on to add to your message: comments?...<br /><br />In any event, it was most timely of you, as I have just finished reading \\"Stoner\\", an American novel which takes place in the world of academia, the first in-depth one here on this topic.  Whether you would also wish to read it is another matter, but I thoroughly found it enriching and rewarding.  The story is as follows:<br /><br />Born at the turn of the 20th century in Missouri, William Stoner, the only child of humble parents on a dying farm, begins at the age of six to toil along with his father, attending the rural school at eight, while working early morning and late evening on a variety of monotonous chores awaiting him at home.  At seventeen, his tall and broad shoulders are already beginning to stoop under the weight of this workload.  The near-silent family barely subsists, and while Stoner goes through the mechanics of existence, he never complains and follows the sterile life pattern of his father and mother until he is nineteen.  An encounter with a country agent engenders a rare conversation between Stoner and his father, who feels that his son might profit from higher agricultural and scientific education, and Stoner enrolls in the University of Missouri in Columbus in the fall of 1910.  Starting as a freshman in the College of Agriculture, he soon develops a passion for English literature and feels alive with a sense of awe for the first time.  He goes on to become an associate professor in English at the University and never returns home in the true sense of the word.<br /><br />Early in this psychological novel, there is a generous streak of nobility and chivalry to be found in William Stoner's character, both moving and real, and I found myself following this young man's awakening with emotion as he is taken under the wing of his difficult professor and mentor, Archer Sloane.  When Stoner approaches him for advice in April 1917, on whether to enlist with his two friends in the army, Sloane speaks to him harshly about the realities of life as we all go marching on through time.<br /><br />It is the late author John Williams (1922-1994) and creator of Stoner, who is able with a deep sense of honesty, exquisite clarity of prose and conviction to make one reflect deeply on all these subjects.  He treats Stoner with such tenderness and objectivity that I increasingly cared for this decent, intelligent and gentle man.  To my mind, he meets the definition of a \\"Hero\\".<br /><br />The structure of this masterpiece is set in a stark and realistic framework where Stoner makes two young friends, also acting instructors in the form of the arrogant, flamboyant and brilliant David Masters and the affable and generous-minded Gordon Finch, three very different men.  One memorable evening Dave Masters sums up their respective personalities, situation and future at Columbus:  \\"It is an asylum or a rest home, for the infirm, the aged, the discontent, and the otherwise incompetent - we are The University\\".  When Masters is one of the first casualties of WWI, Stoner having glimpsed once into the living heart of his friend, takes him on in spirit for the duration of his lifetime.<br /><br />As his story progresses, Stoner falls in love with a beautiful young woman, the daughter of a banker from St. Louis, and the reader realizes perhaps even before they marry, that Edith Bostwick is suffering from mental illness at a time when there is no helpfor her (the school of Freud is not present here).  It is a chilling and unsettling portrait of a marriage, and the impact on Stoner and his future is crippling.  His wife who eventually goes on to reinvent herself on the death of her father, will not let him establish a paternal rapport with his young daughter whom he loves, and there is more tragedy in this story.<br /><br />It is inevitable and with good reason that some readers are going to find 'Stoner' too alienating and sad for their taste, both dull and Spartan.  Certainly at a younger age, I might have set this aside as a winter's tale with a frown.  But, today what really drew my attention to Stoner is in fact the joy and fulfillment he finds in his work and vocation, his hidden passion for life, his great and requited love affair with a student Katherine Driscoll, happy in so many ways, and eventually his show of character and morality when his great enemy Hollis Lomax attempts to destroy him.  If I had to pinpoint what stood out foremost in this novel on a personal basis, it is the showdown between Lomax, using his puppet Walker, a damaged and dishonest student, to ruin Stoner who confronts him at all costs.  There was some brilliant irony here when Stoner starts interrogating Walker, and how he is able to expose him.  As for Lomax, in his introduction of 'Stoner', John McGahern described as one of the most acclaimed Irish writers of his generation (1934-2006) goes on to say:  'In a novel of brilliant portraits, that of Hollis Lomax is the most complex.  Some of the scenes of conflict are almost unbearable in their intensity'.<br /><br />In conclusion, Mr. Woods, and if you are still with me, I will cite what McGahern has to add in his introduction, while agreeing with him when it comes to the central idea of the novel:  'It is surely that of love, the many forms love takes and all the forces that oppose it\\".  At the end of the story, I felt the loss of a friend in Stoner while discovering a new author in John Williams, who produced as one critic suggested, not only a great novel but a near-perfect one, both moving and highly memorable.  Recommend at your leisure and when you and Mrs. Woods have finished unpacking those 30 boxes and more in your new and sunny dwellings.for her (the school of Freud is not present here).

B004T2QZL8|1.0|The newest version of this game forces my kindle to stop responding.To be more specific the app keeps closing.the farthest I've gotten is the intro.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator that looks nice, works as it should, and has wonderfully big buttons. I definately recommend for those looking for a simple calculator, especially children, the elderly and others who have trouble typing the wrong buttons, since the size is nice and large.
B008E6I1K8|5.0|I have been programming in VB for the last 2 decades and before that I have been using C++, Pascal. Friend of mine, who programs in C# said: you should make the switch to C#, I did it and never looked back. An job came around the corner and C# was the preferred language, I looked around for examples and almost all were in C#, so I make the switch. Looked around for a well written C# book also covering .Net and found this excellent book. It just resonated with me and in a few weeks read more than half of it on my Kindle. The format and language used in this book is very accessible and certainly not boring. I can recommend this book to any &#34;switching&#34; developer.
B002GYVRRI|5.0|Red always sounded dull. Now it sounds amazing. I only listened to the CD. I'd love to hear<br />the DVD-A, I want to get a player soon. The CD sounds as good as the best digital I've heard,<br />SA-CD, SHM included. I forgot how great this album was. UK does a few songs on their new DVD<br />so I bought this. I had it on vinyl back in the 70s, this just kills it. I think I'll get the new vinyl also<br />when it comes out.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|It's Bocelli at his best. Live, outdoors, strings, orchestra, duets, and fantastic arrangements. Feels like you are in Portofino, Italy on a summer night.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it really is a fun game but the truth is I'm just in it for the points I get for making this review :P
B003E88TKS|5.0|The movie centers on a busy but hollow character played by Clooney. When he must deal with the newest technology and a hotshot new MBA, he adapts. He meets a female version of himself, but she has some grounding. When he loses yet another chance for a solid relationship, he re-considers where he is in life. A great movie!
B00004TDTO|5.0|The movie is fabulous and a classic. Unfortunately the DVD case was missing a clip to hold it inside so it moves around inside. I am afraid it will get scratched. Can I get a replacement case only? Thanks

B005PK56TA|4.0|Every gag & gimmick from the horror classics gets reprocessed to support a fundamentally simple story. Cheating husband must live with consequences FOREVER, ghosts scare (or kill) new owners - property values spiral down, boy meets girl with a twist, next door neighbor keeps her dead family...

B008YZ4RR0|5.0|I love these movies , they are well put together, They couldn't have picked a better person to play &#34;Jessie Stone&#34;, than Tom Selleck. I will rate them all the same , cause I have yet too see a bad one. Hope you enjoy them as much as my wife and I do.. The King Family.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I loved the film, I love the music, ALL the music.  This soundtrack is the entire film soundtrack, not just the highlights.  For those that want to hear all their favorites, you need to get this version of the soundtrack!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I liked the plot an how it panned out , an the fact that it was partly filmed locally, holds some value too me  . I enjoyed it. Hope you and yours will too. The King Family.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is one of those books that once you start reading it, you don't want to put it down, and when you do have to put it down you are thinking about it. I really enjoyed it.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Read it as a child, read it as an adult...always a classic. If you haven't read it, now it the time.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I like the glowing feature on the controller and the grips on the controller provide a suitable & sustainable experience. Overall, it's a phenomenal product and I appreciate the craftsmanship!
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie. Truly inspiring and depicts the meaning of real life and true friendship! Well written. Great actors!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|First of all, I was attracted to this bag because it looks much more stylish than most camera bags I've looked at. Looks like a standard backpack, but about 2/3 the size.  The build quality is superb, and I'm proud to be wearing it. I love the rubber amazon zipper things all over the place.  There are so many pockets and compartments, that I actually lost my entire SLR battery charger and cord since I forgot there is a giant secondary big opening for more stuff.  7/22 Edit:  The strings on the front of the pack have gotten really hard and weird with age.  They have completely dried out and are no longer elastic.  Now they are just limply hanging and have all sorts of these bends all over it.  Check the photo out.   The soft back padding will get sand from the beach in it very easily and it takes a while to shake it all out (or your car can do it for you and shake it into your back seats). So just be aware of that.  The zipped pockets inside the main compartment are a very cool plastic material. The main compartment itself is perfect for customizing exactly how you need it, and I feel 100% confident with my expensive camera and lenses inside.  A fantastic product, and my first 'AmazonBasics' product..... I will be looking at what else they make, that is for sure.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It doesn't matter in what years you went to high school, this book fits you. Especially if you were a wallflower/geek/nerd/whatever. This book tells your story. Boy or girl, it doesn't matter. Wonderful book.

B000FVE3AC|5.0|Let me just tell you I have some high end Tags and this watch actually works better. I got the watch fast and was everything I hoped it would be. Pulled it out the box brought it to my jewerly store and had them polish it. Got to tell you I was really suspect because of the price. I mean two hundred is nothing to spend on a watch. I'm impressed with this watch and people always think its a rolex. It sweeps well and has some pretty good meat to it. I got this watch because the rolex I wanted that looks like this one is 33,000 dollars. They only make that dial with a white gold band. Buy this watch and you'll love it. Just make sure you get the band polished it will cost you about twenty bucks.
B00AFZ86BA|5.0|Man I sure miss this days when guitar players actually did more than strum or make noise.  Don't get me wrong this music is still out there but it is not Arena worthy or popular like when this was new.  This just reminds me how much I loved the hair metal craze.  This package is awesome, but not sure how much remastering was done but for the price who cares.  I already owned all the CD's and bought then again anyway to support my favorite genre of rock music.  \m/ \m/

B0042ESTQW|5.0|This Garmin made product fits my 800 perfectly as intended. It offers added protection to the Garmin 800. Helps keep the unit looking brand new.
B00B5JBZGS|3.0|First off I want to say that I am a fan of KSE's music and own all of their albums and I like both singers. This is a very good album and worth the money however, the heavy rhythm and multiple breakdowns of their previous albums has been replaced with faster more mainstream rhythm with less breakdowns. Jessie's voice has changed significantly since the first albums, screams are still great but the melodies are a different story. Due to the changes in music and vocals this album sounds like many other mainstream  bands, it s good, just not KSE good.<br /><br />Oh ya, the DVD was boring as hell.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|It was not the movie I was hoping to watch very disappointed.Wish I had not watched it. Wasted my time.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I loved the movie when I saw it on the big screen.  I already owned the original London CD cast recording and had seen the play several times in New York and Boston so I wanted to own the movie so I could see it whenever I needed a Les Miz fix.  I play the album all the time while driving to/from work.  The movie is great, maybe the singing is not up to the level of the original play or the cast recording but the movie is still wonderful.  I was especially pleased to see the orginal Jean Valjean - Colm Wilkinson - in the movie playing the bishop.  Great casting surprise.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A some game should by it if you like temple run related games.<br />I play this game all the time it is so infecting.
B00C5ZNUCS|4.0|With the exception of Idolatrine and Jigolo Har Megiddo which vear a little far from the path this is album is pretty much perfect. If those are a little too \\"sunny\\" for you Body and Blood could probably be a hard pill to swallow as well, personally it's one of my favorite tracks. Other stand out tracks are Per Aspera Ad Inferi, Secular Haze, Ghuleh/Zombie Queen, Year Zero and Monstrance Clocks. Over all a Fantastic Followup to Opus Eponymous.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|I really look forward to reading the rest of Joe's books. He is a great storyteller and really gets into the minds of his characters.
B00C5ZS5SC|5.0|Like others have stated, I too had not heard of this artist so I gave it a spin.  This is music!  Very nice!  It is not often an album like this is released where every song is good.  Usually, one, two, three or maybe even four tracks are good with the rest filler, but this is solid all the way through!  Excellent work!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is a real distraction, I need to keep turning the pages to see what happens next. Brilliant writing and a great story!
B009R659L8|5.0|This book was wonderful. It was very complex and kept moving. I started it and could not put it down until I finished. The mysterious explosion at the beginning of the book was only the tip of the iceberg of mysteries. Mary Higgins Clark is an incredible storyteller. I have read everything she has written. She is truly an American treasure!
B0031RS64G|1.0|I tried to read this book and gave it a good shot, but it was meaningless and had no form.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The first 3/4 of the book were great!  I was really into it and could not put it down... But the last part and especially the ending... Was TERRIBLE.  I had told my sister to read this when I was done, but now I think I'll tell her not to.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|There is a lot of interesting information in this story about Alzheimers.  I recommend it for anyone who knows someone dealing with  this.
B001I8A76A|5.0|Pink both rocks and breaks your heart in this creative venture!  Fun to sing along with!!!  Get it, rock out !
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I rated the book because it was very absorbing I cared about the characters. I loved their intelligence it also made me understand  the way the youth of today looks at  death. I'm sure not all but  it appeals to a number of young people.<br /><br /> It opened dialogue with myself and my granddaughter who is a teenager. Which again is a good book to me. Any time you can talk about your feelings and your views across age barriers it is a good book.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|We enjoyed the movie and thought that it was really funny. A lot of foul language though so keep the kids away!
B005KELQEU|5.0|Provides enough protection for my kindle, while not adding extra bulk. I would recommend this case to any of my friends.
B000T45C6E|4.0|It was convenient to stream this movie through Amazon. Probably would not pay $3 to rent through Amazon again for 24 hours again but needed to for a school assignment.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great show only downfall it is addictive, highly recommend. Watch the good wife. The actors and stories are very good.
B00821OX98|5.0|I watched the first episode of this series on a whim while eating dinner one night since<br />nothing else on television seemed interesting.  I ended up watching about half of the<br />first season that night and the second half the next night.  The series is very well done,<br />and most of the actors do a great job.  It's not quite another Battlestar Galactica, but<br />this seems to be a pretty solid scifi drama.
015204907X|5.0|My 4 year old daughter can read this book to me now.  It's quite cute and not boring like so many early books.  I actually don't mind when she picks to re-read it over and over :)  We like to speculate what the sheep on the last page are doing (Ned Kelly sheep? (in square helmet)
B006QQQ5SI|5.0|Enjoyed this movie detailing the antics of birders in a &#34;Big Year&#34; as they counted all the birds they could in one year. Good acting and a fun theme - shortly afterwards, my boyfriend and I put up bird feeders I'd neglected and began our on on-site list!

1616550414|5.0|The book is everything you expected from it, It has a lot of details about the official zelda story line, all of the concept art from every game and many suprises (like characters designs that were scrapped or never released before). The cover is very pretty and the pages are of high quality. The pages seemed a little delicate to turn, but maybe that's just how it feels to me.<br />Although, my only complain would be the terrible packaging; i had to exchanged it 3 times just to get a book that was in proper conditions. Amazon should really take advice and protect the books better, is painful to see printed works like this handled/wrapped so poorly -sadface-
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a wonderful game,graphics, story line. Just plain fun for hours.Great way to pass a little time and enjoy yourself.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|The movie is simply amazing and the animation is worth praising. I bought the movie in blue-ray and I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because it is different from other books I've read which are mostly sappy romance, love triangle, ugly duckling etc. kind of books. This book is heartbreaking but it still creates a happy ending.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|It was ok, might need to hear it a few more times.  Although I did like 2 songs I think this cd has potential to be an all time fav of mines.
0307949508|4.0|Read all the other two books so this was a let down because I didn't read them in order.  Really enjoyed the series.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Love the show and the characters.  The story lines are great as well.  Only downside is some of the facepalm moments.
0374533571|5.0|Loved the book and loved the movie.  Could see why it was up for Oscars. Either the book or the movie will move you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great! I love playing it! I actually win a lot more than with the other app that I had purchased.  By far, this one by MobilityWare is the BEST!  When I win, that thing the cards so, like a little dance, I love sooo much! Its like the cards are celebrating with me!  Kudos to MobilityWare!!
B00C5ZNUCS|5.0|Just buy this album. It's original yet familiar. Haunting yet addicting. This band is the future big name act that metal needs. Eventually you'll all succumb to the church of satan and worship at the altar of Papa Emeritus II.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this quick reference and use it all the time.  I am not the greatest speller and it is so handy to have at my fingertips.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Hilarious! Especially loved the chapters on mommyhood. It's nice to know Hollywood is made up of real people that experience the same things we do.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|The entire series was intriquing and was complex to a degree where predictability was minimized. Appeal to young and old alike.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Great book, but I had to put it down many times because I was too distressed to continue.  I had to gather my courage before I could finish. If you must have your happy ending, this is not the book for you.  I guess you don't pick up a book about plantation life, if you want all flowers and sunsets.
0634049011|4.0|It is exactly the product I was looking for, This truly met all expectations. Fully recommended for people who want to buy
0439023483|5.0|I couldn't put it down, I loved the story and the characters. It made me view the movie differently since knowing the inner workings of Katniss' mind. I would definitely recommend it.
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci - what more needs to be said. Well written and keeps your interest to the end. You will really like this.

0525478817|5.0|It was great to be able to read a story where I knew where a lot of the things in the book where.  The author lives in Indianapolis. Loved his writing. Loved and Hated this book at the same time. If you want a book that will bring you to tears, this is the one.
B0026KX5PO|4.0|engaging and suspenseful. you cannot miss a beat. One cant help feeling sorry for the characters.  A lesson for all ages.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|A nice tool for a quick check from a smart phone. But lacks details to make a purchasing decision, which is disappointing on a tablet.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian was well written.Very interesting and easy to read.It was a hard science ,science fiction book with a plausible plot,that drew the reader in,and kept them interested in the story right to the end.
B00B671W6W|5.0|Anthrax pretty much perfected these covers. Joey is spot on in every song, which shows he very much still has his range. If you like any of the originals, get Anthems. Of course if you are an Anthrax fan, you will not be disappointed!
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This show is brilliant. FX did such a great job with this show. I would highly recommend this season to everyone
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The Hunger Games generally reminds me of nearly every teenage girl I ever met. That being said, I believe Candice is wonderfully written, as well as Gale and Peata. I really enjoyed the first book, didn't much care for the second and avoided reading this book for nearly two years. I will say that book three was better than two, but neither was as good as one. I feel that the story was told in book one, the remaining books were a result of greed rather than art. You can't have too much of a good thing because it ceases to be good when you get too much. I hope all the young ladies out there are happy about the ending. I was pulling for the other guy.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|This guy cracks me up. He think he knows everything. I'd like to try out some of his advice someday.
B00B9YDT5Y|5.0|One is rather obviously tempted to ask whether another SM compilation is needed, with a single CD og double CD collection already in hand. The single collection, Glittering Prize 81/92, may be enough for many, showcasing the main hits from their era when they were truly a force among the likes of Big Country and even U2. The double CD, The Best of SM, added some key tracks to the big hits but lacked yet a few ones. This 3CD collection (mostly) covers the whole ground, including their whole career, all the main hits and (most) of the lessor known single tracks.<br /><br />The first CD covers their early era when they evolved from Roxy Music/Bowie wannabees towards becoming synth specialists. The last few tracks are taken from Sparkle in the Rain, when they dramatically changed from the synth sound to the more raw and bombastic Steve Lillywhite sound. CD two covers their period when their popularity reached a peak. CD 3 showcases songs after they lost their popularity but many of them are yet very good. Cry, Home and Stars Will Lead the Way are great songs that the casual SM fan gets on one disc with other very good tunes.<br /><br />For the very casual fan, the other SM compilations will do. For those SM fans who are not ready to listen to their whole catalogue but want a taste of their music made outside of their realm of popularity, this compilation is an ideal choice.

B001J32H6M|5.0|I thought I would never own this CD. For many of my childhood favorites, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are the holy grail of movies. Recently I started trying to build up my John Williams collection, one of the greatest composers to ever grace the silver screen with his variety and sweeping scores - but most of his discs are no longer available to purchase locally, or even within a reasonable drive from where I live and work. When I found this CD on Amazon, I knew I had to have it. The Temple of Doom is my favorite Indy flick, and this score does not disappoint. It is full of energy and a handful of amazing themes. Very exciting stuff to listen to on a long drive to the city! The disc itself was brand new, as listed, and the packing material used for shipping was perfect. Will definitely be building my library of Williams music even more!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book very funny this is good for the price it took me 1hour to finish that's how good
B0057UA4FY|5.0|I came to the Clone Wars party a little too late. I remember watching the animated movie in theaters and being disappointed, mostly because Attack of the Clones was my favorite movie of the prequels, and the animated, wooden characters did not accurately represent the intrigue that the legendary Clone Wars brought to mind. That said, this first season of the television show, aired on Cartoon Network, brought back my faith in the characters I loved from the Prequels. The voice acting is top notch, and the stories, all self-contained to a point, gave a lot more character development to some lesser-showcased ones from the movies and the mythology. Now that Disney owns Lucasfilm, if you want to watch this show, you may want to snag a copy quick before it goes into the Disney vault! The fifth season is, as far as we can tell, the final season that viewers will ever see on television.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Great movie! As always it came on time, the film was fantastic. Even though you knew the ending, it's still good to see our troops kick some ass!
0062238310|5.0|What can I say? This book is BEAUTIFUL. I expected no less from Julian Fellowes. His writing shines even more now that it's been collected in book-form, complete with his own commentary on the writing process, his research, and inspiration for characters and situations. I'd already watched every episode of Downton Abbey before I purchased this. In fact, the publication was delayed from its initial release until Season 3 was concluded here in the States. I was worried at first since no hardcover option was available, but don't be fooled by that. The quality of the paper and cover are wonderful and it feels rich when you hold it. I'll eagerly await the collection for Season 2!
B004KPLVV8|4.0|Rating older films known for their then-groundbreaking technical merit can be difficult. Reviewing Tron even within period parameters yields equally middling results. [[ASIN:B000UBMSB8 Blade Runner]], which shared the use of futurist Syd Mead, was also released in 1982. [[ASIN:B0015NORDW WarGames]] followed the next year. Regarded against both of these peers, Tron falters.<br /><br />As a film of environmental proportions, Blade Runner cannot be beat. Not in the 1980s, probably not ever. So densely packed with texture was Blade Runner that special photographic effects supervisor David Dryer once said, \\"The environment in the film is almost a protagonist.\\" And no less than creator Philip K. Dick, after seeing a rough cut shortly before his death, remarked, \\"You would literally have to go five times to see it before you could assimilate the information that is fired at you.\\"<br /><br />As admittedly lighter fare, WarGames beats Tron, too. It's got requisite arcade games, humor, romance, and enough gizmos to impress without risking the kind of epilepsy that Tron must have induced in theaters, especially that light cycle race.<br /><br />So where does that leave Tron and how to best enjoy it? Well, watch the documentary first. \\"The Making of TRON\\" on disc two here: an excellent effort which will put the film in the proper historical context. Nuclear war, which figures so prominently in both WarGames (as a plot device) and Blade Runner (as backstory) has thankfully not transpired in the real world. On the other hand, the divide between user and computer has continued to shrink with every week. If we are not yet \\"one\\" with our devices, our youngest generation will come very close. Tron may therefore be the most prescient of the three films. That integrated terminal in Dillinger's desk? It's *still* ultra cool.<br /><br />Sure, some of Tron's acting is overdone. And to be fair, those scenes in the final third drag a little, especially on the long journey aboard the solar sailer. But just like the astronauts who may (or [[ASIN:1906512477 may not]]) have gone to the moon using the power of a Casio calculator, the mere existence of Tron is testament to director Steven Lisberger's vision and the work of his creative team. Shooting the (in-computer) scenes in black & white, then hand coloring every.single.frame? Wow.<br /><br />1982 was a tough year to be a sci-fi film. It wasn't just Blade Runner and Tron. ET and Poltergeist were also released that year. Perhaps it was all too much for 1982's audiences to handle. Tron wasn't even nominated for the visual effects Oscar! With the passage of time, the story in Tron has become appreciable, if not completely believable. Unfortunately, the circa-1981 computer animation--absolutely cutting edge technology at the time--anchors this film, and prevents it from being as powerful Now as it should have been Then.<br /><br />This is still an important film. 4 stars for this Two-Disc Special Edition.ailer.

B00000272N|5.0|An album not as well known as some of the later releases but still holds some the best work from one of the quintessential grunge bands. One that had a significant part in laying the foundation for what became rock music in the 90's. The combination of Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell's vocals guided by Jerry Cantrell's wailing guitar shows the pure genius held within this awesome creation.

B00BHU9DUK|1.0|Wasted my money. Beautiful scenery. Over all disjointed and boring. Wish I had never rented this movie. Over all very BAD!!!
B0009VRHLK|2.0|I bought this dvd on the strength of Buffalo '66, but<br />was sadly disappointed by the nothingness that prevailed.<br />I thought that because of the excellent soundtrack of B. '66<br />that at least his excellent taste in music would save the film.<br />Not to be, for me anyway.<br />If you're a fan of the man, see him in Arizona Dream, that<br />is a sleeper indie that sports a superb cast that brings quirkyness<br />to a new level.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|you get the app great fun and you can earn thing I would get this ap its fun and cool
B0050PYNN0|5.0|... this off-beat flick is a screwball comedy with no pretensions of being anything else- It's sort of half stoner comedy and half swords-and-sorcery spoof. It succeeds on both levels  and has verbal, character, and visual jokes that are delivered non stop!<br />The real gag, however, is lost on many.  This was clearly written by people who had spent a few years playing Dungeons And Dragons, and noticed that the personalty of the D&D characters was more similar to the players (good-natured  but silly, 100% passive, or grumpy, needlessly argumentative nerds), than the selfless, intelligent heroes found in fantasy literature.<br />This movie tries something new, and succeeds handily.<br /> Watching Zooey Deschanel  and Natalie Portman deliver terribly campy lines with straight faces and eyes full of mirth  is a treat. You have the feeling this was a very fun set to work on... keep in mind, this was made this same year as \\"Black Swan\\".  Some contrast!<br />The special effects are good for a medium-budget picture.<br />Rated \\"R\\" for -relax! Make a drink! Put your feet up! And enjoy.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Story was very well written. Kept me guessing, just when I thought I had it figured out<br />the story went in another direction.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use, and it WORKS.  What more could you ask?  Nice selection of sounds and tunes to bring you out of your slumbers.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|Love this movie!  And I especially loved all the behind the scenes stuff.  It was amazing to see how this movie was accomplished.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Not having seen a stage performance of &#34;Phantom&#34;, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was blown away both by the power of the play but also by the individual performances. Highly recommended.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Fringe is the best series since X-Files.<br />Well worth the purchase of Season 3.<br />We watched season 1 and 2 when it was on FOX but missed the rest of seasons 3,4,5.<br />Plan to purchase seasons 4 and 5 also.
B0041G683W|4.0|I really enjoyed this performance, however it wasn't as strong as the 10th anniversary performance. I think they could have done better than casting Nick Jonas as Marius. His voice lacked the power of the other performers. Lea Salonga as Fantine and Samantha Barks as Eponine gave stellar performances, as did Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean. Overall a very good performance, but a little less than I was expecting.
B000035P5E|5.0|I needed the DVD for a film club presentation. The service was quick (2 days), the price was good, and the quality of the DVD was good.

B007L6VR12|5.0|Enjoyed this very much. Wes Anderson makes great movies. They are visually appealing...quite theatrical. Great characters and story lines. He is quite the story teller.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|These ladies have the most beautiful voices, and their blend is marvelous.  The instrumentation is beautiful, and Mairead's violin is outstanding.  This may be the  most exciting musical group going!!
B004SIPA4G|4.0|I like the bluray release & I really like the directors cut. Being able to go in order gives the film a better flow
1475143389|5.0|A wonderful book -  as the title suggests -  it is the simple science towards improving the male body.  It really isn't that complicated, but some books would try to make you think it is.  I probably have a dozen different books with different programs, workouts, regimens, etc... but this one for me is the best.  The exercises are straight forward, simple progressions, and I personally like the option of a 5 day a week workout plan over most which favor 3 days per week.  The nutrition advice is spot on, and again, easy to follow.  Worth the money, worth the effort to put it in to place.  Buy it.  Read it.  Then do the work!
B00APVC8BI|4.0|The story is different than what people are used to from the first film. Fans of the first will enjoy the little touches from the first. I thought the story was good. The actors did good & how can you go wrong with Biel & Beckinsdale?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book to the series...and just like the other two...it's was perfect..a definite must read!!!! You will not be disappointed
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Always enjoy how he thinks through everything and figures the puzzle out. A little sad that the female agent died.
B001DF68MA|5.0|It is really easy to ride my bike with this and my son loves sitting up front! I bought this for him right before he turned 1 and he still rides it with me now and he is 2 and half years old! And when he gets tired he just puts his head on the front head rest and passes out! I just purchased another one for my sister-in-law and her baby. The only pain was putting in on and when we want to transfer it from bike to bike. It's wise to buy that support pole that holds up the WeeRide if you have two bikes you are going to be using with this!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Wished it would have been edited down to a PG movie.  I wanted my children to see it and appreciate the sacrifices of the revolution but did not appreciate the overdone &#34;selling herself&#34; scene and never appreciated the &#34;Master of the House&#34; scene.  The vigilance was what I expected.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I really enjoyed this soundtrack. John Powell musically captured the spirit of the movie and infused the music with an almost celtic feel in some of the tracks. (some tracks feature an Irish whistle carrying the melody). While much of the CD is dynamically thrilling, the louder, exciting pieces are punctuated by softer and more flowing melodies telling a musical story that mirrors the plot of the movie. You can almost tell what's going on in certain parts of the soundtrack. The quality of the recording is stellar as well. Powell makes full use of the orchestra and you can really feel the dynamics on a high end sound system. I'm using a Onkyo TX-NR818 with JBL studio speakers in a 7.1 configuration. Even at a lower volume, the music still excites. Futhermore, many of the melodies are a bit catchy and evoke feelings of awe, heroism and adventurism. It's great in the car too. Overall, I highly recommend this sound track to movie enthusiasts, classical music lovers or those who are just seeking some quality music.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|Very happy to have this  2 cd package containing 8 original albums. So much music for so little price. What a bargain! Gary L.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|amazon prime is the best... they need more movies like this. quality was great and looking forward to more content!
B00797MB0O|1.0|Boring boring boring!!!!!!!! You have to be drunk to think this movie was a great. I can't believe that they made this movie.
B0083V2WBS|5.0|I was so excited to see him perform on the piano and sings too,wow.  I loved the way he showed his enthusiasm for the<br /><br />New Orleans talented preformers.  It will be in my collection for years to come and I thank you.<br /><br />Patty in Lincoln, Ca.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is full of exciting twists and turns.  I loved it!!!!!  Adults and teens would love this trilogy.  Try it.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The video quality was great! But I turned the movie off after about an hour. I felt the story repetitious and kinda juvenile. I was so excited to be able to see it finally, but was really disappointed in the story. I watched the animated airings of 'The Hobbit' on TV years ago with mu kids,. so I was familiar with the story and expected some embellishment to make a full length motion picture. I am a huge LOTR and Peter Jackson fan. I bought every edition of all three movies when released on DVD and watched daily. So, fantasy/and sci fi is my thing! And at 63 yrs young, I know what moves me, this movie didn't.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I originally read this by checking the books out at the library. I enjoyed it enough to buy the books.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was an easy read; I was engaged from the very first page. I purchased this book to read on vacation. The story was captivating. I finished the book in one day. I couldn't wait to see what happened next.<br />Although it was a bit sad at times, I actually got teary eyed more than a few times.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone. The family issues and behaviors identified are global. The father's relationship with his sons is univeral. Parental favoritism is commonplace, and can be extremely hurtful, as seen here. The issue of mental illness waas broached with compassion and sensitivity. It think it was expertly done.<br /><br />This was my first book experience with my new Kindle and I could not be more pleaased. I m looking forward to borrowing and/ or buying many more books to be read anywhere I happen to be.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have to say subway suffers is better then temple run because it has more to it! I am also happy it is free! But if it did coust money it would be worth it!
B007N579X6|5.0|I am a pretty big fan of good 3D, and Despicable Me in 3D is amazing.  The 3D is almost as good as the 3D in Brave or Wreck it Raplh.  I highly recommend this flick...

B00B8PMWJI|3.0|Not surprisingly The ABC's of Death has huge variety with 26 completely different interpretations of dying (however toilets do seem to be a recurring theme). The shorts range from bloody acts of violence and brutality to the downright ridiculous and puzzling.<br /><br />Each director showcases various techniques (animation, live-action, slow-motion etc.) to deliver a unique death within their segment. The style, content and quality is immensely varied, so expect the unexpected. With a 3 minute time limit it's difficult to get bored with this film, which at 123 minutes is pretty impressive. At the end of each story the 'chosen' word is revealed to the audience, usually to accompany an unexpected plot twist.<br /><br />It's hard to pin down this film in one review, phrases would range from awesomely disgusting to terribly amateur, so watch it with an open mind. Some are bizarre; even now I have no idea what the letter 'Z' was about. Be prepared, this film is not for the faint hearted, yes there are comical and carefree plots, but to even the balance there are many 'bucket' reaching moments. All's fair in love and death.<br /><br />Hold on to your seats...It's time to go back to school.<br /><br />[...]
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A well written book that helps to give an appreciation of the mindset and sacrifice of our warriors. This story is one of survival and humanity.
B009GENZ12|2.0|First things first to appreciate this film you should forget that the name of the director is Pascal Laugier (Martyrs). Although this film has similarities in directing, this is not a horror movie so do not anticipate graphic gore as you will be left disappointed. The film begins slowly, 45 minutes in you feel as if you were cheated, as it seems that the mystery has been resolved too early.<br /><br />Then suddenly, twists start flying into the storyline left, right and (you got it) centre, and once again the game is back on. Jessica Biel gives one of her best performances, as the tortured emotional soul, who draws us into a story that could end, frankly anywhere.<br /><br />Laugier is an exceptional director, whose focus on themes of self sacrifice run through many of his films, leaving us questioning our moral opinions and emotions. He has successfully produced two very different genre films, and yet can instil a unique mark on both. So stick with this film until the end, it leaves you reeling (not retching) and thinking for days.<br /><br />Another thoughtful plot that is sure to leave you feeling slightly less queasy than the self-sacrifice shown in his previous work... this is a promise.<br /><br />[...]
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning. I'm glad Connor didn't turn out to be some serial killer...that would of been sad. I enjoyed this story a lot. Read it in matter of hours.
B00AIBZLVY|3.0|Mama offers the expected horror clichés, but remains notable for it's clever choice of camera angles, adequate jump scenes, and thanks to the acting the narrative is (to an extent) believable.<br /><br />The film jumps straight into the plot, not wasting time on a lengthy introduction.<br /><br />However the pace and tension within the film could have been more tightly knitted together, by disposing of some needless scenes that reveal minor details to the storyline.<br /><br />The CGI works well in the beginning as we see snippets and quick flashes of the unknown presence, but then the ghost is revealed too early in the film. This however would be fine if the source of the fear was something to behold in terror and could remain so after the reveal, but if we don't 'believe' in it, it has lost it's direction and our attention.<br />However, the overall setting and shots in the film, combined with good acting, allows for an enjoyable horror, just don't take it too seriously. Enjoy and embrace Mama for its cliché's and obvious build-ups.<br /><br />Conventions are after all created because they work within their genre, and this film is no exception.<br /><br />[...]
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved this quick read, the complex characters and the vivid descriptions. The vocabulary is awesome and I had to use a dictionary several times. A poignant sad tragic story with the most unforeseen outcome.
B008JFUNYG|2.0|The storyline is unsurprisingly similar, but it fails to convey atmosphere and depth to the characters. The opening is used to `establish' the evil that will be unleashed, basically acting as a `Here's what to expect before the film has been begun' slogan.<br /><br />The film is sombre and depressing as we are introduced to characters that are consumed with their own dramas and problems, leaving no room for subtle humour or pace, that the first had and this film badly needed. The music is filled with classic horror cues, and there are two notable jumps (for me) at least.<br /><br />The gore is in abundance, and with the majority being practicable effects instead of CG, it's impressive, especially when taking into account the report that over 500,000 gallons of fake blood was used in one day. However, what this film lacks in story and substance is attempted to be replaced by blood and guts; not that I am complaining of course, but it feels like another lazy Saw franchise fob off. You can almost hear the director saying \\"Feed them mindless gore and they will love it...\\"<br /><br />As a standalone film I enjoyed it, but the inescapable Evil Dead `original elephant' in the room only serves to create nostalgia for the original. Evil Dead is a modern echo of a cult classic that will disappoint diehard fans looking for the stylish balance of terror and black humour that resonates so easily from the first. To be honest I enjoyed the last 10 minutes the most, as the momentum of the story picked up and the storyline finally had my attention. A gory film that tries to compensate with blood, but with a tagline that it cannot live up to.<br /><br />If you go down to the woods today you're in for a nasty surprise...<br /><br />[...]

1609611543|1.0|I was excited about this book because I thought I could lose some belly fat by cutting out wheat carbohydrates.  I tried the diet for 4 weeks.  I did not lose any belly fat and actually gained 5 pounds.  The extra weight was enough to cause my diabetes to soar.  I now have to take medicine again for diabetes, whereas I didn't have to for the last 5 years.  The data presented in this book are mostly anecdotal.  No controlled studies have been done that show a positive effect from this diet program.  I am a scientist, and should have known better, but I really wanted to believe this would work. The book is interesting and well written.  Too bad Dr. Davis didn't use the scientific method to prove what he claims before he wrote it.

The best thing about this story that I love is the power of healing through patience and love... Unconditional love! Such an amazing story and the characters seemed so real I thought I was a part of the story! Loved it!

B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 was already a classic. The Vita's OLED screen makes the colors pop out wonderfully. I swear, my Vita's screen brightness is always on the lowest setting. Almost worth buying a Vita for this game alone.
B0018LMZOO|5.0|In my opinion, the BEST Band ever. I remember listening to Ride My See Saw on my first FM radio, back in the 60's when FM rock stations were few and far between, and you never heard a long version of a song unless you bought the album. It is wonderful to see them still performing to sell out crowds.
0316069434|3.0|I have read, and nearly always loved, everything Michael Connelly has written, but this one was a real disappointment.  Without revealing any plot, I can say that it was just about unbelievable at times, particularly as it roared through its finish.  I found far too much police investigative details, and was even put off a bit by the author's overuse of his love for jazz and jazz musicians.<br /><br />So will I read the next Connolly book?  OF COURSE I WILL - - he has long been one of my favorites, and I will give him a pass on this mediocre effort.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|Very sad that a Rap artist/group gets inducted (RAP?????) into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and after 40+ years of truly wonderful music, the Moody Blues are still waiting.
B00461MY30|5.0|I've had mine for two years now and it's just a  fantastic box set. The covers are fine. Yes, they're all matt finish. With the exception of Rolling Stones No.2.  That one don't look that great. Bad coloring. The sound of these records is very clean and spectacular. No surface noise once cleaned. Nice analog sound throughout, even though they were mastered using DSD technology. Warm mids, punchy clear bass, clean bright trebles. All perfectly mastered from a very fresh source. While I noticed, some aren't  as strong and up front as my original Decca pressings i compared them with. Aftermath, BTB, Let It Bleed, & Their Satanic Majesties Request, all sound brilliant. Beggars Banquet is the correct speed, Let It Bleed has become most every audiophile's preference. You just can't go wrong with this box set. I wish it wasn't a limited edition. I bought mine when it first came out. Wish I could have afforded another one. Well, I can say in some cases  prefer my original Decca pressings, but BTB, Beggars Banquet And Their Satanic Majesties Request, all sound gorgeous, and have a really clear high quality analog sound. Grab it before it's too late. My review is at this time, the only one relevant. As I have done the AB comparason on real UK Decca pressings. I'm a audio lunatic, I own over 2,000 vinyl. Most are originals, some Hoffman masterings, some Parlophone Beatles lps etc.  I would never get rid of this set. I play it quite often, and I love it. These babies have gone up since I bought mine for $230.00.  Good luck.
B003Y5H5JM|2.0|This is such a visual movie, it is an affront to the audience that the Blu-Ray edition has no improvement on the DVD version to offer.<br /><br />The movie is well directed, see other reviews for such criticism.<br /><br />Just don't waste extra money expect full crisp 1080 definition images.<br /><br />What a waste!
0143120530|5.0|it's a very good premise not working for me quite yet but it has helped some I guess I just need to devout more time to it :)
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|This is a great movie for both children and adults--full of fantasy.  I especially liked how it touched on all the mythical characters, but altered them just a little to shake things up a bit--what fun.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|I love this app and recommend it for people that want a quick easy way to touch up your pictures. I would NOT use this app for drawing, if you want drawing use Sketchbook, that thing is fantastic. But pictures and works of art you want to just add a quick effect to or to fix the sharpness/focus/red eyes blah blab blah.... this is perfect

B005S9EKCW|5.0|As a huge fan I walked into the cinema on 20/12/12 with no real high hopes as the hype was incredible.<br /><br />I also thought Russell Crowe might ruin the movie with his singing.<br /><br />The end result is the most emotive,brilliant movie I have ever seen. Hugh Grant was great as well Annie Hathaway with the show stopper \\" I dreamed a dream\\".<br /><br />I have never been to a movie which had standing ovations & the general public openly bawling in the cinema.<br /><br />It is hands down the best movie I have ever seen.
B000067FP8|5.0|GREMLINS 2 is a great movie too!!!! The first one and this one are classics recommended to all the family!!!! It´s really FUN!!!!!
B006OEPITO|4.0|Read this book about 50 years ago and wanted to see if it struck me differently now.  An interesting, timeless read.
B005CRY2O6|4.0|Interesting dishes and favors.  The Directions could sometimes be a bit clearer, but definitely a good addition to my kitchen.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|Bad Pharma deserves a five star rating first and foremost because it delivers a message about a world-wide crisis in medical practice that has been largely neglected even by those who have been calling for health care reform.  The word &#34;corrupt&#34; is not too strong a summary of the condition of the relationship between the pharmaceutical industry,  the governmental entities which ostensibly regulate it, and ultimately those who write the prescriptions for patients who are woefully too uninformed to defend themselves against the malfeasance of an entire industry.  if you are interested in health care reform, you should read this book, because practically nothing in it is even being discussed in the political arena despite the fact that it is of much greater life-and-death consequence than any reforms either presently implemented or even contemplated.  That fact alone should engender the outrage of anyone who cares for or cares about those who suffer needlessly as a result of the inadequate testing and reporting on both the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceuticals that impact the health of nearly every person on the planet..
B00B97SNJI|5.0|I never knew of the band Dawes until I heard them a few months ago when I started listening to my public radio station.  I really liked what I heard so I was eager to get their new CD when it recently became available.  What a joy to listen to.  Every song tells a wonderful story - Taylor Goldsmith is the gifted lead singer/songwriter for the group.  In my opinion, there are no bad songs on this CD.  I would highly recommend.
B005PK1G76|5.0|It is great and good price I love it and it work just right for my Britax B-Agile stroller. I was looking for one other than the one that is for that stroller but lower price and I am glad i found this

B003TJ4YUQ|3.0|Nice mix of music, not as good as first album but good tunes.<br />Playing for Change is a worth while project, worth supporting.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Super cute movie of course! Funny and with meaning! It is worthy to pay for it! Everybody at home loved it!
B000BYA5G4|3.0|movie was a little darker than i expected in subject matter. not one of Nicolas Cage better movies. Plot is very lacking and not easy to follow to even see a plot.
0767827902|5.0|I just love this movie.<br /> I didn't see it in 40+ years & when I was watch it it was like I was see this movie for the very first time.<br />It was so good. The actors was even better.

B001AFF25W|2.0|i was excited about this book hoping for inspiring words and ideas. Instead I was treated to the same old things, a little patronizing and a waste of my $$
B007VUA7VO|5.0|easy to use, tells me in a glance how to optimise my battery usage. The little extra features like customizing the icon colors are a nice touch.

0143120530|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone searching to improve their ability to commit things into long term memory. The techniques are simple and I enjoyed going with Josh on his journey...googling for advice in the areas where I wanted to know more and do it myself. In the last week, I have developed a good use of the method of loci and have committed people, actions, and objects to 70/99 numbers for remembering number strings. I have been able to use these techniques to remember grocery lists, the Chinese zodiac (for fun), my credit card number, meditation practices, and even scriptures.... This is great!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a very well written book with vivid explanations of what survival would be like in the most bizarre of circumstances.  Keeps the reader captivated every moment!
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|I loved this book.  Found it extremely sad, but couldn't stop reading. Mumma Mae and Poppa George what a wonderful couple they were under such difficult circumstances.
B002APS61I|4.0|This movie was good overall with just enough romance to keep you captivated.  Nice scenery.  A classic movie based on a classic novel!
B0095P29EG|5.0|The movie kept our attention from beginning to end.  It was an action packed movie that was great to watch.
B003E8GQ76|3.0|This movie was OK but not great.  The ending just left me hanging and unsatisfied.  Probably would not watch it again.
0545265355|5.0|This world that Suzanne Collins has created, is amazing. If you were like me and disliked books, after reading these it will change your mind. I had read this series 3 years ago and it still keeps me up at night thinking about Katniss's amazing story. This is a series that I can read over and over again, and never get tired of. Now, if you aren't picking these amazing books up because it's a YA book, you should really look past that. And ignore the whole \\"next Twilight\\" because you can't compare. You will have quotes stuck in your mind. Once you pick these books you will not be able to put these down. I decided to buy this boxed set because my older books were in terrible condition. I love these books, the box is a nice little box. Now about the series, characters are not one dimensional, they are defenitly relateable. The love triangle plays along well in the story, yes there is a love triangle in here, but it's really something minor compared to all the other things that are going on.<br /><br />The Hunger Games: In a post apocalyptic future nation, lies Panem. Panem is made of 12 districts, and the the Captiol, which is in charge of all the other districts. Each district is in charge of a particular source such as district 7 being in charge of Lumber. Before, there use to be 13 districts, but all 13 districts rebelled against the Capitol. The Captol blew up district 13. As for a punishment and reminder, all 12 districts must participate in the annual Hunger Games, where for the Captiol's entertainment, they force 1boy and 1girl from each district to fight to death, which is broadcasted live. The Capitol treats their districts very poorly, they also like to place bets on who will make it out alive. Now in district 12 we meet our heroin Katniss Everdeen, who volunteers as tribute after her sister Primrose Everdeen is chosen. There is a age range 12-18. Katniss is forced into an arena where she must fight to stay alive, along side fellow tribute Peeta Mellark, whom she feels owes something, because Peeta Mellark saved her from death.<br /><br />Catching Fire: The second installment of the Hunger Games. Katniss and Peeta have survived the hunger games. But it's not at all what Katniss wanted it to be like. President Snow is keeping a close eye on her. Peeta has turned his back on her. And so has her best friend Gale. Katniss must continue to act in love, for Snow has warned her, if she doesn't act in love and makes it convincing she isn't just putting herself in danger. There is unrest in the districts. There might even be rebellion starting and if Katniss and Peeta fail to convince people that they were driven by mad love for each other, then they can end up in a serious situation. And that's not all there have been rumors that district 13 does exist.<br /><br />Mockingjay: The third and final installment of the Hunger Games. Katniss thinks she should be dead, after surviving not once but the hunger games twice. After being rescued from the arena, katniss finds out that district 13 does in fact exist. It had been planed to rescue Katniss from the arena from the beginning, the only people that didn't know about it was Katniss and Peeta. Peeta was captured by the Captiol, and Katniss also learns that her home was destroyed. The rebellion against the Captiol has boken into full force, and they want Katniss to become the symbol of the rebellion, they want her to become the Mockingjay. But can Katniss put all her hurt and empty feelings inside to become the peoples Mockingjay.she feels owes something, because Peeta Mellark saved her from death.<br /><br />Catching Fire: The second installment of the Hunger Games.

B0083Z3O8Y|2.0|This was my second read of a Jane Austen & my last. I really don't like this stuffy Enlgish-style. Not a classic in my opinion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing I especially love how they change the setting and now they give you save Mes that's the best thing I've ever seen
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a really spellbinding book so much so that I couldn't wait to turn the pages.  All the characters are beautifully rendered and jump from the pages as real life people.  I loved the evolution of the story  and it all seemed so true to life.  &#34;Me Before You&#34; is a story that will stay with me for a long, long time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If any wait in till Redstone comes in the game it will be sooooooooo fun if I could make the game up date I wold
B004478AS4|4.0|I didn't give this book a chance when it was assigned to me in college but with positive reviews from so many of my classmates, I decided to go back and give it a try...I am glad that I did.  It's become an excellent ice-breaker with my Nigerian friends and I think it provides great course material for both highschool and college classes.  The cultural barriers and conflicts that we see all the time across the world are studied by following the simple and tragic story of the main character and his village.  Unlike others that approach the subject, I think that the author did a great job of staying relatively neutral as I didn't feel like there was any finger pointing or exaggerated accusations.<br /><br />The book read slower in the beginning but I think it became very exciting towards the end.<br /><br />Wikipedia's take on the significance of the book was helpful to me when I decided to purchase it on my kindle.  Thus, this is what that source has to say:<br />Things Fall Apart is a milestone in African literature. It has come to be seen as the archetypal modern African novel in English,[2][5] and is read in Nigeria and throughout Africa. Of all of Achebe's works, Things Fall Apart is the one read most often, and has generated the most critical response, examination, and literary criticism. It is studied widely in Europe and North America, where it has spawned numerous secondary and tertiary analytical works. It has achieved similar status and repute in India, Australia and Oceania.[2] Considered Achebe's magnum opus, it has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.[28] Time Magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005.[29] The novel has been translated into more than fifty languages, and is often used in literature, world history, and African studies courses across the world.<br /><br />Achebe is now considered to be the essential novelist on African identity, nationalism, and decolonization. Achebe's main focus has been cultural ambiguity and contestation. The complexity of novels such as Things Fall Apart depends on Achebe's ability to bring competing cultural systems and their languages to the same level of representation, dialogue, and contestation.[5]<br /><br />Reviewers have praised Achebe's neutral narration and have described Things Fall Apart as a realistic novel. Much of the critical discussion about Things Fall Apart concentrates on the socio-political aspects of the novel, including the friction between the members of Igbo society as confront the intrusive and overpowering presence of Western government and beliefs. Ernest N. Emenyonu commented that \\"Things Fall Apart is indeed a classic study of cross-cultural misunderstanding and the consequences to the rest of humanity, when a belligerent culture or civilization, out of sheer arrogance and ethnocentrism, takes it upon itself to invade another culture, another civilization.\\"[30]<br /><br />Achebe's writing about African society, in telling from an African point of view the story of the colonization of the Igbo, tends to extinguish the misconception that African culture had been savage and primitive. In Things Fall Apart, western culture is portrayed as being \\"arrogant and ethnocentric,\\" insisting that the African culture needed a leader. As it had no kings or chiefs, Umofian culture was vulnerable to invasion by western civilization. It is felt that the repression of the Igbo language at the end of the novel contributes greatly to the destruction of the culture. Although Achebe favors the African culture of the pre-western society, the author attributes its destruction to the \\"weaknesses within the native structure.\\" Achebe portrays the culture as having a religion, a government, a system of money, and an artistic tradition, as well as a judicial system.been cultural ambiguity and contestation.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series on television! Zombies getting their faces smashed open in glorious detail! Love the characters and the suspense that death (or even worse) is around every corner every second of each episode, and even the &#34;badguys&#34; like the governor are motivated to be the way they are.. it's just epic.
B0001AP158|5.0|This DVD is a must for Bon Jovi fans.  The new arrangements of their greatest hits showcases the incredible talent of this band.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|great action and enjoyed the humor that was thrown in also.  Great film work on the action scenes.<br />one of the better mission impossible films.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|Seamless from installation through complete gameplay. Impressive graphics and content that make it worth buying and playing.  Playing on Kindle tablet and after first few saves and restarts, the game loaded and played without any delays.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like to play it it is berry fun people likes to play it even I like to play it it as Everett fun so much it like100000 people likes it
0547564651|5.0|I like the fact that the author takes a very data driven approach to what are the attributes that lead to success.  One of the key takeaways for me is that parents are the key contributors to good education for children, much more so than teachers.  I think a lot of this generation's debate about education is misguided because we place too much of the blame on the teachers and do not place enough accountability to the parents.  Reason that Asian kids are so successful in school isn't because they have better teachers - it's because they have parents who place greater value on education and scholastic excellence.<br /><br />Now, the other takeaway of the book is that intelligence isn't a sufficient prognosticator of &#34;success&#34;.  In many ways, &#34;character&#34; is much more important.  In my experience of having graduated from a really good school, having worked at a reputable high tech company and having created a successful business, I would agree with that assessment with the people that I have come across - that once you have sufficient IQ, character matters much more in the long run.
B008ODZUN2|1.0|It is an extremely boring movie,I had to turn it off after 10 minutes of waching. now dialogue, dark picture, and aweful music.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Easily one of the top five books I've ever read. Masterfully written with perfect character development, it was incredibly hard to put the book down. I just had to know what was going to happen next! This is the kind of story/writing that sticks with you. Several times after major plot points I was sitting there holding my Kindle, either grinning like an idiot or left with my mouth hanging open. Bravo, Mr. Howey - I look forward to more from this saga!<br /><br />PS - this would make a killer movie. Just sayin'.
B00C1E8E7E|1.0|The only explanation I have for this CD is that two producers must have a bet as to who could find and record the most tone-deaf, lame rapper.  We have a winner!  Waterboarding would be a picnic compared to listening to this.  I'd be afraid to even use it for a skeet target -- I might miss and some poor, innocent person might find it and listen to it.  I assume the Deluxe version of this masterpiece is a nicer box and no CD in it.  At least it should be.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|This was like watching the comic book version of Les Miserables. Admittedly, it would be very difficult to show the many subplots and relationships between the characters or to develop the characters as carefully as Victor Hugo does in a 2 hour (or so) film. But this film seems to just grab a few highlights and leave everything else aside. Sometimes it is difficult to see the motivation for the characters' actions. If I hadn't read the novel I would probably have been lost at times. Visually the film is really stunning. The music and songs are mostly background noise with some lyrics to give some explanation to the action. There are a few memorable songs such as Marius' &#34;Empty chairs&#34; but most of the score is forgettable.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Great story line. Great acting. Better than most tv. I would recommend this series to the person that loves rollercoasters.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I enjoy this show very much.  The way the main premise is woven through each episode well, so that we viewers don't forget that it's not just a basic legal drama; that there's much more going on.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|It's okay, it works flawlessly, very basic. It seems to have a problem with orientation but I'm using it on a tablet it may work fine on a phone.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great entertainment. Hard to put down. I have reccomended it to all my friends and family. A must read for dog people.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|The first season is taking the viewer somewhere in a most circuitous route; at the end of season one, despite a few clues, the destination is still unknown...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Had to get 2nd season just to remain filled in on the gossip in the house..  EXCELLENT!  On to 3rd!
0525953728|5.0|Exciting autobiography detailing his time in the Seals.  If you enjoyed Zero Dark 30 this is a great complement as it is obviously a primary resource for the end of the movie.  Maps and diagrams of the attack enhance understanding what really occurred.  Good read.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I read a few of the one star reviews on here, and there are a lot of complaints about it not running on kindle fires. I have the Kindle Fire HD, and it runs great. Downloaded in under a minute while connected to wi-fi, installed, and I was playing it in less than two minutes. Maybe some people skip the tutorial, but I had no problem creating items, interacting with them, and moving them around. I'm already to the third world, and it's really a fun game. I can see how some people would breeze through this, but it has a LOT of replay value, because each time you play, there are hundreds of possible solutions.  I'm very excited to play this game over and over, and look forward to coming up with new ways to solve each puzzle over and over.<br /><br />Kindle Fire HD - Works GREAT.<br /><br />I have a Galaxy 3, which I'll install it on as well, and see if it works as well. I'll be sure to review once I do.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|This book is nothing special....and written for a 6th grade mentality.<br />Advice to the author,<br />William Landay....Get a day job.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is pretty good for a free app. I have been playing it for awhile now and haven't spent a dime.<br /><br />Even though you do play the same few rooms at the beginning, the items are hardly ever in the same place and if you do find all the items you get different rewards.<br /><br />It is a slower paced game which I like. I'm not completing it in one or two days and its not requesting I buy the &quot;full&quot; game to advance.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is my app has been not wanting to load the past few days but it could be my kindle and not the app....so not for sure.<br /><br />Overall good game.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game will put you on edge! Be alert! Just try it and you will know what l mean. Hours of fun!
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|Funny how all the negative reviewers are still stuck in the past with the \\"OLD Wayne.\\" I love the Old Wayne just as much as I like the New Wayne. Why do people insist on taking sides? Why do people HAVE to pick a favorite Lil Wayne? Times change, people change, circumstances change, mentalities change, and so does music. Just because Lil Wayne is not the same Lil Wayne pre-Carter 3 doesn't mean people have to be loyal to a Lil Wayne in a certain time period. One can enjoy Lil Wayne at every stage of his life.<br /><br />As far as the album goes, I honestly did not expect it to be this good, based off his recent work (IANAHB1 and C4) even though I enjoyed them both. Lil Wayne is and always has been on top of his bar game and this album is no different. Sure, he references drugs, sex, and other activities that most of the reviewers deemed \\"repetitive,\\" however, his inventive wordplay and charisma have once again, raised the bar, and far outweighs any negativity that you readers have heard about this fantastic album. I found this album interesting, conceptual, thoughtful, motivational, and overall, entertaining.<br /><br />Final thought: Don't hate the man for doing what he really wants to do. How would you feel if you did something you really wanted to do and the people threw dirt on you? Geez-Louise! Let the man cook!<br /><br />Remember, we are all a part of Wayne's journey through life, so enjoy him while he's here because they never made `em like Wayne and they will never make `em like Wayne. Appreciate what this man brings and if you don't, don't waste your time and energy HATING on another soul that is completely free and open. In fact, use his gangsta mentality of `doing whatever you want' and incorporate a little bit of his lifestyle into your everyday life. Step into his world and see things from his perspective. Be open-minded to everything and learn to appreciate the positives.<br /><br />Note: If anyone is wondering if I even bought the CD, yes, but I bought the Target Deluxe Edition because I had to have that exclusive song produced by David Banner.ht the Target Deluxe Edition because I had to have that exclusive song produced by David Banner.

B007REV4T8|3.0|I've never been a die-hard bond film fan, as I always found them to be too corny.  However, I did appreciate the pizazz brought by Brosnon, and was even more impressed by the great action scenes with Daniel Craig.  This film just didn't have that many memorable action scenes, and now, nearly 2 weeks after watching, I just can't seem to remember any; however, I still easily recall action scenes from both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace.  Skyfall is not a bad film, just not a great one.  I think it was worth adding it to my collection, if only to maintain the series' integrity.
0141345659|5.0|This book brought up a lot of emotions. It made me want to cry; It made me literally laugh out loud that I am sure other people thought I was crazy. The book was very good, I recommend.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Didn't get to see this in the theater, so waited for the DVD.  Glad I didn't buy it as a BlueRay.  Virtually no dialog throughot the film, and Russel Crow though an excellent actor, can't carry more than one note.  I like Hugh Jackman in every film I'veseen him in...except for this one.  I regretted purchasing this video.  There was, however, a couple of excellent performances from the young boy and girl, but not enough to warrant the $17 I spent to add this to my video collection.

B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Very disappointed by this film.  I had to struggle to keep my attention focused throughout most of the film.  Then the kick in the gut was that it's only 1/3 of a reasonably short book.  I was so let down that I doubt if I will even bother to see the next two installments until I can find them in the $5 bin at my local discount department store.  I regretted spending my money on this DVD.

B009AMANBA|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis did a superb job in portraying Lincoln.  I don't think anyone could have done better.  My wife was very disappointed that the film captured only a very short time-span of Lincoln's presidency which was almost exclusively focused on his efforts to get the thirteenth amendment (abolishment of slavery in the U.S.) to the U.S. Constitution passed.  The film insinuates that the passage of the 13th amendment was the primary reason for Lincoln's assassination.  Though I'm not a historian, my recollection of U.S. History indicated that there were several reasons for the assassination and not just, or primarily the 13th amendment.  An excellent film, nonetheless, and a good insight to how our congress worked in the past that helps you better understand the difficulties in our congress in the present.  All have their own interests (self and districts/States) and each will defend those interests to the end.  It's a wonder Congress manages to get anything of real importance accomplished.  I highly recommend this film.

B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|Don't listen to the bad reviews--this movie is a beautiful fantastical journey! Yes, it's long, but so are the books it's based on. I honestly didn't notice the length, and wouldn't cut out a single scene. Brilliant.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This is not a great film but it's a good one. It's about finding Bin Laden and some of it is even true to history although the main character is fictitious. What makes the film worth watching are the details of the manhunt and the incredible care that Bin Laden took to evade detection for almost ten years. The characters in the film are of course all stereotypes (Hollywood can never resist the same tired old formulas)but the cheese is endurable and the focus on Bin Laden is never lost. Of course we all know how it ends and the scenes in the Bin Laden compound are the best of the film, cold, brutal and inexorable. Anyway, it's worth watching.
B0027MJU00|5.0|If you read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and think you're prepared for Flynn's intense storylines, you will still be surprised by this. Flynn keeps the reader mystified as to the truth, which allows you to empathize fully with the narrator. It's a disturbing read, but well worth the journey.

B00B5JBZGS|4.0|Adam Dutkiewicz is back and better than ever!  The new Adam Dutkiewicz is way better than the old Adam Dutkiewicz. I have been waiting for a new Killswitch Engage album for a while and the wait is finally over. This album would have been a 5 star if it was not for people talking so much about Howard Jones and Jesse Leech. Yes, they are both great singers but without Adam Dutkiewicz you got just a mediocre band.(Lightswitch On)If vocals are the \\"Main\\" thing about Killswitch Engage, then the song I love in that is respect is \\"Beyond the Flames\\". But overall, Adam Dutkiewicz is amazing in every song. Adam Dutkiewicz!
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|A time period set adolescent love story that avoids tawdry voyeurism and shows a better way to be for all of America's teens.  This film has tones from 50's and 60's Disney films without the stupid naivete.  The cast is amazing as they embrace Mr. Anderson's wonderul vision of what it is to fall in love as a young person entering a new world.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|The series begins slow - and cumbersome.  The characters are ill-defined, the plots are sometimes forgettable - I watched one show and by the middle of it, I couldn't remember the beginning and I couldn't remember what it was about . . . .  and this was with no commercials!  I am thus surprised that this series was not cut off after the first few episodes.<br /><br />The second half of the season kicks in pretty good.  Interesting plots, although the character development remains sparse and unfolds too slowly . . .  but note that the backstory of the characters is a major portion in the long-term plot of this series.<br /><br />The series is really a sequence of connected stories - serialized, if you will.  The writers reveal the story (including the backstory of the characters) slowly - and as a result, the characters are frequently so shrouded in mystery that they became (to me, at least) unimportant.  I sometimes had trouble caring about the characters.<br /><br />I purchased the regular DVD set.  This is a nice transfer that plays very well on my 720p, 42\\" TV.  I'm not sure I could tell the difference between this transfer and a Blu-Ray rendering - but I say that without seeing it in Blu-ray.<br /><br />I think the gold standard in this genre is the X-Files, and this first season of Fringe does not measure up to it.  Of course, this may be an unfair comparison, since on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, the X-Files should receive a \\"10\\".<br /><br />Nonetheless, I rate this overall at four stars.  I'd rate the weak introductory episodes at two stars; but I'd rate second half of the season as five stars.<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've now watched the first four seasons of Fringe.  It builds in intensity from each episode to the next - to the point that by season 4 it has become a really tremendous work with an involving plot.  The characters are great - I've come to care about them so much that I just don't want to let them go . . .  Still to watch season 5.<br /><br />I'm glad that I slogged through the first season.  It has become so enjoyable as it moves forward.<br /><br />Warning . . . this is a series for people who want to connect with their characters; but also for people with brains.  The plot unfolds in a clear, yet complex fashion.  So plug in your brain and enjoy the ride!

B007REV4YI|5.0|After the lukewarm reception that Quantum of Solace received in 2008, where the James Bond films would go next was uncertain. That uncertainty was worsened when MGM found itself going into bankruptcy, delaying another film by years. The series though would rebound and a new Bond film was to be out in time for the series' fiftieth anniversary. Would this anniversary film, and twenty-third entry, be able to bring the series back on track?<br /><br />The Craig era of Bond has been about developing Bond as a character and this film goes far in that direction. Taking cues from latter Ian Fleming Bond novels, Skyfall does exactly that. Craig's Bond in particular seems well suited to this as we see a Bond who, after being left for dead after a mission, eventually finds that he must return to MI6 and rediscover who he is again. The film also sees some humor come into the character as well and Craig for the most part handles it well. If Casino Royale was Craig's debut as Bond, then this is the film where he slides into the role of experienced agent.<br /><br />The film's two female leads are quite interesting. Naomie Harris as Eve is an interesting, if flawed character though the character due to her lack of chemistry with Craig and being perhaps just a bit old for the whole \\"junior agent\\" idea to be believable. The other is B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe as S&eacute;v&eacute;rine who fits much more into the traditional role of the Bond female lead yet is also given some interesting space to develop as well. While neither is perfect, both are memorable and serve the film well.<br /><br />Last but not least is Javier Bardem as the villainous Raoul Silva. From the moment the character is introduced in what seems to be a long single take, it's clear this is a villain quite different from what we've encountered before in Bond. While he does arguably have echoes of a couple of previous Bond villains as well as the Joker from The Dark Knight, Silva is more than just another madman. He's a compelling figure and a villain that, for the first time in a while, rightfully fights with Bond for your attention whenever he's on screen. There's also a feeling of discomfort that exudes from the character as well, especially in his first and last scenes. The result is perhaps the most compelling Bond villain in some time.<br /><br />The film also features a strong supporting cast. Returning yet again is Judi Dench as M, getting her largest time in the role here. The film makes good use of her talents and takes the character away from being a stuck behind the desk bureaucrat and makes her a vital part of the film. There are also fine performances from Ralph Fiennes as Mallory, Ben Whishaw's excellent debut as Q, Rory Kinnear as Tanner and an excellent appearance by Albert Finney as Kincade. The result is one of the strongest casts yet put together for a Bond film.<br /><br />The film also heralds some impressive action sequences. From the opening sequence in Istanbul, the film takes its viewers on a journey around the world from fights in Shanghai to a chase below and on the London streets to a final climatic battle that seems reminiscent of the finales of the classic Bond films of the 1960s yet also incredibly different from them at the same time. The sequences are all well done and are perhaps the most impressive yet seen in the Craig era.<br /><br />For all of its impressive action sequences, Skyfall feels like that it is as much a drama as it is an action film. Skyfall explores questions of age and legacy, perhaps appropriately for a film series celebrating its fiftieth birthday. These range from questions about Bond's fitness to be a double-o to M's own suitability as head of MI6 to the secrets of both of their pasts which come into play as the film goes on. While the middle part of the film in London echoes The Dark Knight quite heavily (and indeed uses the nearly identical \\"he wanted us to catch him\\" line as well), the film works well at bringingtogether both the action scenes and the dramatic scenes to create a coherent story (and a great improvement over its immediate predecessor). Add on some nice references to the series' own legacy (including the much welcomed return of a character missing from the Craig era as well as icon of the series dating back to almost its beginning) and the result is fantastic all around.<br /><br />So how does Skyfall stand up as both the fiftieth birthday film and as a Bond film in general? It celebrates the legacy of the series by using the plot to ask its relevance in the modern world and ultimately saying that Bond (and the series by default) does indeed. As a Bond film it pushes the boundaries of mixing action with the dramatic in a way not really seen in the series before now. On both counts then, Skyfall succeeds and does so fantastically.scenes and the dramatic scenes to create a coherent story (and a great improvement over its immediate predecessor).

0739308742|5.0|This review is for the audio version of \\"A Feast of Crows\\" narrated by Jon Lee.  I like Jon Lee's narration of this book much better than Roy Dotrice's.  I wish Jon Lee had done the narration for all the audio books.<br /><br />I just can't listen to the audio books narrated by Dotrice.  I don't like the way Dotrice slobbers for the voice of Lord Varys, the inconsistent use of different voices for certain characters, or the limited number of voices which Dotrice uses.  There's also something about Dotrice's voice or accent that just turns me off.<br /><br />Jon Lee's voice is much richer and more comfortable to listen too.  He would have been a much better choice for narration of this series.  Another good narrator would have been Jim Dale.  It's really unfortunate that they chose Roy Dotrice instead of someone better.
0425264351|2.0|started out well, as most Lee Child books do. But the longer it goes on (and believe me it was too long) the more unbelievable the story got.

0307887898|3.0|\\"The Lean Startup\\" by Eric Ries is a good book for someone who is interested in starting a business but does not have a background in starting up companies or have been an early employee at a sucessful startup company.<br /><br />The concepts of the Startup can be boiled down to the following:<br /><br />1) You must get traction with your customers as quickly as possible.  Product/service development is a highly iterative process.  If you do not structure your organization to embrace the iterations, then you are most likely going to fail.<br /><br />2) The 80/20 rule should be applied to your product --> do 20% of work to get 80% of target value of the product.  The product should then have customer review/feedback as quickly as possible.  If you can get the customers involved in the QA/UAT of the product, it is the best way to go.<br /><br />3) You must get market validation (aka people willing to pay for the product) of your product as soon as physically possible.  The product will then evolve rapidly to meet a growing market segment.<br /><br />Tribalism in your early adaptors is very important.  The early adoptors will help drive your product into the next set of adopters via influencers.<br /><br />4) Businesses should be using what is termed \\"emergent strategy\\" --> try things and see what gets traction in the market.  Do not assume you know what the market really needs/wants --> ask them!<br /><br />5) You can lower the risk of failure by speeding up when customers give you feedback --> organic growth of the market basis is what you should be targeting especially with the rapidly increasing degree of connectivity/information in today's business environment.<br /><br />The book itself is a bit wordy for something that could be expressed in a more compact and effective way.  You might say that the lean startup needs to be more lean and focused. :)
B00BKBCF38|2.0|Few bands in the metal world are as polarizing as Ghost.  I've been listening to metal since Bathory, Venom and Mercyful Fate were new bands.  Frankly, I don't care if a band is Metal enough to live up to their image.  If the music works, I'm fine.  Having said that, I did enjoy the previous Ghost album.  I'd fall short of calling it an instant classic, but there was at least a memorable hook in each track, and the album at least sounded good from a production standpoint.  On their sophomore release, Ghost has changed names to Ghost BC and changed lead singers, though one would have to be paying attention to notice the second of these facts.<br />  Sadly, the album has some serious production problems. The amount of dynamic range compression used renders the whole thing lifeless and thin sounding.  This would perhaps be forgivable if the performances or songwriting was on par with the quirky charm of the first album.  Unfortunately, if you feel Ghost was a bit milquetoast on the first album, this album is 'safer' by a mile.  This truly is relying on theatrics more than anything and I suspect the previous frontman was responsible for clever sonwriting present on the first album.  In short, there is no reason to listen to this over the first album since it has inferior sound, songwriting, and generally sounds phoned in.  Year Zero and Secular Haze are the strongest tracks and almost capture the essence of what made the first album enjoyable.  As much as I was looking forward to this, I will be far more cautious of any future releases from this band.<br /><br />Edit:  in the comments below, I have been corrected that this is the same singer as the previous album.  They just gave him a new name, and staged a theatrical succession on stage.  There was no substance to these changes, and it was all theatrics.

B00BO2VKBG|5.0|As a longtime fan of doom metal, and stoner metal, I've heard many bands attempt to channel the magic of a sound that has its roots in the 70's.  Being older than your average metal head, I remember when Sabbath was still putting out new albums, I remember when Cathederal and St. Vitus were as Doom as it got and I remember when Kyuss was a new thing, practically single handedly starting the stoner metal genre that followed.  Just when I thought I had heard it all, and enough of it...here comes Uncle Acid.  Their previous album was hugely successful not because it used tired tropes done too many times before, but because it had genuinely good songwriting combined with excellent execution.<br />  On their sophomore release, Uncle Acid proves they are no one hit wonder.  Stylistically, things are a bit different this time out.  The songs are generally a bit slower and longer, sometimes venturing into territory that owes more to Revolver era Beatles than Black Sabbath.  The unifying horror theme of the last album has been replaced by songs that more distinctly stand apart from one another.  Have no fear, however, there is no shortage of doom, fuzz or catchy riffs, and the vocals are easily on par with the unique greatness of the last album.  This is in many ways is the best one could expect for a second album. It not only shows that the first album was no fluke, but also is no re-hash.  Here is a band in top form, expanding on the greatness of the genre and their own success.

Now I got this for my grandson for his first birthday and I am EXTREMELY impressed with how fast the shipping was.  I ordered this late Monday night with Free Super Saver Shipping and had it Thursday, way before expected delivery date!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Love this game! So different every time you play it. Just purchased the 5-6 player extension and can't wait to try it.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great season 2 can't wait for season 3. Three classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories put to a modern twist, also I like how they include modern technology in the stories , ie Iphones, too bad Holmes doesn't use one to solve his mysteries.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|I fell in love with Nausicaa reading the manga and this movie does the story great justice.  Highly recommend it.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great series.  Can't wait for season 4.  The acting is superb.  The location and setting are beautiful.  I love Lady Mary and Violet! It's a great story about the British Aristocracy and is fast paced.  The servants and all the workings...........it's a wonderful escape from reality.

B005DI66N4|5.0|The book \\"The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom\\" is the amazing and tragic personal account of a Polish Officer named Slavomir Rawicz.  Slavomir's story begins when he was a young cavalry officer in the Polish army.<br />Slav, as he was called, grew up near Poland's border with Russia.  He was fluent in Russian and as a youth, made occasional mischievous trips across the border.  When the Germans invaded Russia, the Russians became very suspicious of any non-Russian citizen that lived in Russia or spoke the language, so they began to hunt them as potential traitors and spies.  The fact that Slav was fluent in Russian and that he was a Polish Officer made him an obvious target for the Soviet Secret Police (N.K.V.D.).<br />Slavomir was taken by the Secret Police for interrogation.  He was held for several months and during that time he was forced to endure long torture sessions, as well as starvation and sleep deprivation in an effort to get him to admit he was a spy.  Though he was sent to more than one interrogation facility, he was eventually convicted and sentenced to 25 years in a Russian labor camp in Eastern Siberia.  The trip there was long and arduous and was travelled by train and by foot.  Many of the prisoners travelling with him died from starvation, cruel treatment, and freezing temperatures.  It was in the Siberian camp, months later, that he and six of his fellow prisoners hatched an escape plan.<br />This is where the adventure begins.  Their journey to freedom started in the Siberian winter.  It continued on foot for nearly eighteen months over two thousand miles through some of the most grueling terrain and conditions on the planet.  They stole farm animals and killed wild game for food.  They made shelters for coverage from the elements.  They also relied on the kind and gentle people through their travels for whatever comfort and sustenance those people could provide. They transited through the farmlands and on the outskirts of the small towns of southern Russia where they travelled at night for their safety.  They travels took them through the Gobi Desert of Mongolia and China, where they pushed through intense heat, starvation, and dehydration.  Their journey took them over the Himalaya Mountains of Tibet and Nepal, where they again endured bitter cold and biting winds and overcame oxygen deprivation.  There they met the wonderfully helpful local people and finally entered India where they met the British army, who took them in and deloused and fed them.  Not all of them made it to the safety of British held India but all of them tried.<br />The story Rawicz tells, is both joyous and heartbreaking.  It is a story of man's triumphant spirit.  It is told in painstaking detail and insight by the man that endured it himself.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This stuff pops and sparks with freshness, intelligence, energy. Oh, and add magnetism! Two great personalities show up and show off (vocalist/writer, producer/sound designer). Serious but happy. Funny too! It's clear these guys work hard so they can spit fun.
B009LGO88E|1.0|You can buy the American Version directly from Nintendo of America for $26.74 after taxes and shipping. I just ordered mine and was glad I waited even if with Prime shipping I could have gotten it for $36. For less if you don't have prime you could get it from NOA and have it shipped faster than getting it from Japan and if you do have prime you can upgrade your shipping speed and have a genuine one in the same speed as Prime shipping. I'm not putting amazon down or the circle pad pro xl because they are both great, but I am putting down the resellers that charge almost double. Don't but it anymore and stop putting money in their pockets. They aren't limited edition collectible items so buy them officially from NOA for an authentic item at a cheaper price. No brainer ;)

The 8 year old commented, &#34;I know they are not real, but they look like they are real people!&#34; The preschool aged children might find this a little too scary as the bad guys tend to be... well, bad.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I put off reading this series because I thought it was for kids...I'm 50 year old woman.  However, I finally did start reading Hunger Games and could not put it down!  I loved all the characters, felt drawn to them, the story was enthalling.  I just had to pick up Catching Fire.  It too was captivating, I enjoyed the characters enough, but felt it could have ended there.  When I picked up Mockingjay, I sort of knew how it would unfold, whereas, the other books I could not.  The characters started becoming too obscure, I found myself drifting away from what I was reading to what I would have written!  I became too distracted from the story because it didnt hold my attention.  I found myself not caring who lived, died or ruled.
B002ZG999U|3.0|The Expendables (Sylvester Stallone, 2010)<br /><br />Ten minutes into The Expendables things had already gotten so unbelievable that I asked myself why I was watching this low-rent-but-all-star take on one of my all-time favorite movies, The Dogs of War. But that very unbelievability made it stupidly entertaining enough that I kept going and discovered the movie's few treasures, though most of it is exactly the kind of mindless, predictable action-comedy that I figured I was getting when I went in.<br /><br />That unbelievable opening scene involves our group of Expendables--Barney Ross (Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), and Toll Road (Randy Couture)--rescuing a bunch of hostages from Somalian pirates (led by The Mist's Amin Joseph). The ridiculousness comes from all the bullets flying around and not a single civilian casualty. Amazing how that works! Afterwards, there's a brief scuffle between Yang and the less-ethical Jensen. Jensen departs the group, who are soon after hired by a nameless guy calling himself Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) who wants a Central American dictator, General Garza (Dexter's David Zayas), overthrown, and is willing to offer the job to either Barney's bunch or another band of mercenaries led by Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first screen appearance since 2004, albeit in a cameo). Barney and co. get the job and head off to meet their in-country contact, Sandra (On the Road's Giselle Iti&eacute;), and get to overthrowin'. Problem is, the General is both backed by a guy who may or may not be a CIA operative (The Dark Knight's Eric Roberts) and surrounded by mercenaries himself, ruled by the sadistic Paine (Steve Austin)... and including Jensen, who was with the group long enough to be able to anticipate most of Barney's moves.<br /><br />You will most likely be able to map out the way the entire movie unfolds by the end of the scene with Willis, Stallone, and Schwarzie. Which, as long as you're looking for a brainless action movie, is perfectly okay--but with so many obvious references to the single greatest action movie ever created combined with so many big-huge-massive-name action stars, and I am perfectly willing to admit this may be my problem and not the movie's, I was expecting something more than I got, something like that life-shattering twist where Christopher Walken marches into the new dictator's office as if he's simply going to demand the money he's owed and... does what he does that leaves your jaw sitting on the floor in a drool pool. Or, you know, even a halfway intelligent script that didn't sacrifice brains for one-liners every chance it got. (And this is where those \\"few treasures\\" come in--all of them involve Tool's Bar, where the gang hangs out during downtime; Tool, played by Mickey Rourke, is kind of the group's Yoda, and he is easily the best thing about the film.) But if you take it for what it is, it fulfills its role adequately. ** ½chwarzie.

B001NXDIMK|5.0|Loved Damages and when it became offered on only one channel I could not get with my carrier, I bought the whole series.
B0072OFM28|5.0|this is the second season and if you watched the first one then buying this one is a no-brainer !!! can't wait for the third and final season to complete the collection !!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had such conflicting emotions and loyalties reading this book. I am trying to figure out the best way to word this review without giving anything away. I loved the mystery and the way the author had you think. You knew what was going on, only to find out you didn't. This book really makes you think. Yes I know I'm repeating myself.<br /><br />It's not a beach read where you can set the book aside, go splash around in the ocean and then pick it back up. You want to finish it, now. I almost gave this a four star because of the ending. Then I thought no, when I really thought about the two characters and the history of their personalities and conflict, the author really couldn't end it any other way. Or either Amy or Nick would have been out of character. I know that doesn't make sense, and maybe after you read it, it still won't. But for me, though I was disappointed in the ending, I loved this book and it really couldn't end the way I wanted it to.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is a pure and unadulterated action flick. It goes back and forth between fast paced action and bullet-time sequences that show, in a strangely beautiful and artistic fashion, body parts being blown apart and bullets ripping through flesh and brain. The amount of detail that is present in these slowed down shots is pretty amazing but also kind of disturbing. Definitely worth seeing in HD.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|LED bulb = Great! Five times the battery life *AND* a brighter light? That's what I'm talkin' about! I'm in the trades and my Mini-Mag is a regular necessity for me. It's working out beautifully.<br /><br />On/off button switch = Junk. I didn't search out a replacement switch anyways, I wanted the LED.<br /><br />Altogether I'm quite satisfied.<br /><br />* * * * *<br /><br />Update: August 14, 2013<br /><br />One of the two prongs for this gizmo's LED bulb broke/fell off as I was trying to see why it was flickering like a strobe. Four months of use, then it bit the dust. I've just ordered the new one watt 55 lumens bulb, and we'll see how that holds up before I give up on Nite Ize altogether. Screw me once, shame on you. Screw me twice...
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great product. Batman fans must have this. Full quality and beautiful box. This is the best Batman movies ever. Recommended.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Great looking watch, love the automatic movement on the seconds hand.<br /><br />Cons:  Strap is kind of cheap.  It gets worn out pretty easily.  I already replaced it with a leather band.  I was planning on doing that anyway to give this watch a classy upgrade!
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love the fact that it looks and feels like real leather. I can slip it into my bookshelves if necessary, and noone would notice the difference! One of the reasons I resisted getting an e-book reader is that I love the feel of books, how they often fall open to my favorite place in the book. This gives you at least part of that experience, with the convenience of the electronic media! I just bought a second one, because as soon as I like something, it tends to disappear, and I wanted to be able to continue with this case for my Kindle.<br /><br />I have noticed it wears a bit faster than real leather, but that just gives it the feel of a really old book!
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|When i'm in a chill mood i like to listen to Passion Pit.  It has a lot of great songs and only a couple i regulaly skip over.  Overall great album.
B003D513TQ|5.0|I can't say that I was all that interested in Queen Victoria until I watched this movie. I had seen the BBC miniseries, and of course, Mrs. Brown starring Judi Dench, but they didn't engage my interest nearly as much as this movie did. Yes, there are some historical inaccuracies and some liberties taken with personal interactions, but after now reading and collecting more than 30 books on Victoria, Albert and the time period, I have to say that they are pretty minor. The machinations of Sir John Conroy and Leopold, King of Belgium are very true to reality. The instant attraction between the young princess and prince was very tangible -- you ought to read Victoria's diaries if you doubt it!<br /><br />The one historical inaccuracy that I found a bit hard to swallow was Albert's injury during the first attempt on Victoria's life (there were 9 such assassination attempts during her reign). However, from a standpoint of the plot of the movie, it was an understandable liberty. What I did find very difficult to understand is why the movie never showed how accomplished or educated both were, but especially Albert. Albert was a world class pianist and organist, and played duets with Mendelsohn, for goodness sake! Both are only shown as enjoying music...but that is a minor quibble. Part of the fascination I now have for both Victoria and Albert was sparked by this movie, and I highly recommend it to those who like a good love story, and those who like historically accurate (for the most part) movies.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I really enjoyed this one. It was well-acted, well-written, and an overall joy to watch!<br /><br />Did the fact that I was watching it at 2:00 a.m. because I couldn't sleep affect my perception? Maybe, but I don't think so. This is definitely one that I would watch again and would highly recommend. I wouldn't watch it with young kiddos, however, because there are some sexual situations (as other reviewers have mentioned).<br /><br />Try it out (especially if you're an Amazon Prime member), you literally have nothing to lose except a little time, and I don't think (once it's all said and done) that you're going to feel like you've wasted your time. This is a cute chick flick. If you like cute chick flicks (I do), you'll enjoy this.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Peter Jackson and the rest of the cast and crew did an excellent job adapting The Hobbit to the big screen.  While many believe that they strayed from the book, what they actually did was expand many scenes which were only hinted at in the book but further explained in other Tolkien works.  This makes The Hobbit movie much fuller and more dramatic, tying it in beautifully with The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Greatly anticipating and looking forward to the second installment of The Hobbit saga.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Read the first and second books.  It is OK.  It get old that everything is money and sex and it is not even close to reality in most cases.  First one was great because it was different, second one was good and this one it is just OK to me.  The transaction of course was easy because I have a Kindle.  Prices are always great.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have two kindles--and wanted a spare cord for car re-charge--as usual got it quick and works well-highly recommend-get it

But I started to read and I saw how the character of Kantis is developed and I liked that which makes me finished the book in three days.. If you were disappointed by the 2nd one like me, read this one it will make you change your mind
B00BKBCF38|4.0|Ghost finally released their sophomore album in 2013, after a lot of waiting and speculation on how the band would avoid the 2nd record slump. The debut made some serious waves in the underground metal world, with it's 70's/early 80's style classic riffs, thunderous sound and heavily satanic image. The band managed to harken back to the days when songs could be simply played but with lots of atmosphere and resonance, something missing from a lot of music in the last 15 years. Underneath all the evil and darkness there was some amazing melodic aspects going on, they manage to make these songs catchy and memorable whether it's a vocal hook or a guitar riff. It was that great paradox that made them so fascinating. Darkness and Satan mixed with a snappy almost pop feel.<br /><br />So now the 2nd record \\"Infestissumam\\" is out. After debuting 2 songs as well as a non album track single/cover, the fans eagerly awaited the release of this. Secular Haze and Year Zero were the songs that gave everyone an impression of what was to come. While Secular Haze had an odd circus like feel, both songs felt like they could be on the first album. Ghost expanded their musical identity here though, not content at all with being boxed in. While those 2 cuts have that \\"throwback 70s metal\\" style vibe the debut characterized so well. The intro piece/title track sets the tone with those scary latin chants before going into Per Aspera Ad Inferi, which much like Con Clavi Con Dio from the debut blows the doors down with that ceremonial feel. It's great stuff. The aforementioned Secular Haze acts like a 2nd opening cut, it's a great Satanic rocker, with lots of atmosphere and really evokes the feel of it's title. You can sense that eerie fog and shrouding imagery they present so well here. As expected, the group didn't want just want to go through the motions and remake the same album so they wander off onto other territory. Which is really what makes them so unique and interesting in the firstplace. Some of the other tracks go for a somewhat more late 60's psychedelic almost Doors like feel. Jigolo Har Megiddo is probably the best of the bunch. It has a no holds barred indie rock thing going on, in other words it's the only song here not draped in the theatrical concept and it just rocks. Body & Blood has a good memorable riff and very melodic chorus that harkens back with what they were doing on Elizabeth and Ritual etc. While Idolatrine has that slinky 60's adventurism.  They're definitely more downkey than the uptempo rockers of their old material. Ghuleh/Zombie Queen is by far the most different though, opening with piano and a very storybook feel. It builds up with some pretty guitar lines. It's almost like Ghost's interpretation of a ballad but then it changes midway into a whats basically a surf rock riff and becomes the albums \\"long epic\\" track. Although thats strictly speaking in terms of its lyrical structure and length. The real 'epic' song here is Year Zero. A masterful marriage of Satanic darkness and powerful melodic rock hooks. It has some chillingly rocking verse bits, mixed with a truly soaring and anthem choruses, it's one of their ultimate creations, you'll be singing along and fist pumping to every second of the chorus. The little piece at the end really evokes images of some old 1920's horror film like Nosferatu, it's the only song here that could be considered brilliant.<br /><br />Depth Of Satan's Eyes returns the band to familiar guitar driven material, it's another riff that seems pedestrian at first but reveals some good tunefulness after repeated listens.  Monstrance Clock wraps things up with a slowly woven once again ritualistic type feel, a sing-along almost that celebrates the devil. Pretty interesting of them to close all this with not a rocker but a very theatrical and celebratory sounding song. The 2 bonus cuts - La Mantra Mori is a very good song. It has a beautiful swirling organ throughout it, with a slight acousticguitar strumming in the background and some great smooth singing from Papa, there's an ethereal feel akin to Genesis from the debut that really should've been the closing track instead. It really demonstrates how masterful Ghost's ability to create pretty melodic pieces of music really is. And of course I'm A Marionette which the band debuted back in December 2012, is honestly the best track of this \\"era\\" since its not on the album, we'll just say the albums era. It actually rocks harder than anything on the album itself with the exception of Year Zero, has an awesome descending guitar riff in the verse and a really spine tingling chorus that really evokes something sinister. And yes, it was originally an ABBA song. And while Ghost managed to transform the tune into something evil, it also says a lot about ABBA, who are often preconceived as a sugar coated pop act. The lyrics are actually quite interesting, showing a really dark condescending side to fame. At the end, Infestissumam has a more prog rock/concept album feel, with that in mind it's more of an \\"album\\" experience with only 2-3 songs really sticking out as individual songs you could play whenever. The lyrics deal with an always constant evil presence in the world and the idea of the female perceived as the ultimate force that causes evil and loss of innocence in our culture.  It doesn't quite have as many memorable hooks as the first album but it's another collection of songs that will grow on you, Ghost is a band that won't hit you at first listen. Like many great songwriters it takes time to find the riffs. They went for something different and they succeeded at it. In many ways, there are points of comparison and progression between their 2 records. Year Zero really has a lot in common structurally with the Death Knell as does Per Aspera Ad Inferi with Con Clavi Con Dio and so on with Body & Blood/Prime Mover etc. Opus Eponymous was more of a straightforward rocking album, this one is the \\"stoned out-headphones conceptual\\" album. Lots will be said about this album in the next few months and opinions will vary but if you find Ghost's brand of psychedelic occult vinyl era rock at all enthralling you won't be disappointed with what they've done here. Here's awaiting number 3.

B004PGNB1K|4.0|I got the distinct impressions while reading Wise Man's Fear that Patrick Rothfuss didn't quite know what to do with Kvothe in this, the middle book of the trilogy. It is much less focused than The Name of the Wind.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Rothfuss's brilliant writing style is still very much present. I just wish it was a bit more focused.
B0036R92V2|4.0|Emblematic film from which many directors have borrowed, including Peckinpah and Tarrentino. Great takes and symbolism. A must for lovers and students of Westerns.
B009G78EE2|5.0|The two songs that lead me to purchase this album are \\"Can't hold us\\" and \\"Thrift Shop\\". Both are upbeat and catchy tunes. After listening to the album, I received more than what is usually expected with an album purchase, namely only one or two good songs. The heist has many good songs, and more importantly, the lyrics are powerful and address controversial issues. This album is worth your money and time.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I love watching this movie because it's not too violent so my daughter can watch it, and it's got lots of action so my hubby loves it too. We can have a movie night at our house with this movie!
B00942G4UA|5.0|This DVD should be required reading for all people. It opens many truths about foods to the public. It is difficult to believe that our elected officials put their elections above the people who elect them.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I purchased this CD through a special from Amazon - it was something like $1.99 or $2.99 for the digital booklet. I've already listened to the CD multiple times and will continue to do so. It's a very catchy CD - I highly suggest it!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|read this on hard copy and just had to buy it for my tablet so I could read it again. So much better than the Twilight series. The writing is phenomenal. Story and plot truly amazing.
0765325950|3.0|This is a series that went on way too long (14). Sanderson managed to tie up all the loose ends but the central character Rand (the dragon reborn)was relegated to a side role and shoehorned into a generic sci fi 'man conquers the universe' ending.(VanVogt/ Null A).Matt the gambler peaks out in the previous book (13)and becomes a complete cipher.For the rest it was all happy happy joy joy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book I could not put it down! I have read it twice now and it gets better every time!
B003B02PEU|5.0|This story was just that. I felt like I was there to see the events and feel the emotions of the main character.  I thought this was a thought provoking book. Made me reflect on my won past.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|This is an unusual spin on detective stories. The main character isn't so much a sleuth as he is a caring guy who helps people solve mysteries of their lives because he feels sorry for them. Isaacs is perfect--he becomes Brodie and makes the character so believable and alive!
6305428042|5.0|Every year since Hocus Pocus came out my children and I have watched it every Halloween.I moved and my DVD was damaged, I was heart broken to think all the memories were gone. I searched every where for the movie, and once again was only able to locate this movie on amazon. I was so thrilled, now I can share the tradition with my grandchildren. Thank you Amazon and the seller, for giving me back my memories.
B0067QPVJ6|2.0|The original 1951 version (The Thing From Another World) was an interesting movie but was just begging for a remake. The Kurt Russell 1982 version (The Thing) was quite good but - give me a break - a fully formed creature leaping out of a glass dish with maybe an ounce of blood in it? They could have done it better (see the 1951 approach which was more believable!). This (2011) version, though supposedly a &#34;prequel&#34; to the 1982 version. wasn't as good and seemed little more than a rehash of the Russell storyline. Bottom line? Sub-par story line exceeded only by the poor acting. Buy it at a yard sale or the local dollar store or a cheap Red-Box rental. Otherwise, pass it up.
B00C58QP72|5.0|I thought it was a great movie .  It kept my interest all the way through it.  I'd watch it again and recommend it .
B005CRQ4N8|5.0|Harry potter books may be a little long, but i am a 4th grader and i read all the entire seirs in a year. so i am just going crazey to see what the tales of beetle the bard is going to have!<br /><br />  -Deagan Moore 4th grader
B0092C2X7U|2.0|The game has potential but the blood and guts of the missed landings really turned me off a game that has great potential to appeal to a wide audience.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I like this book better than the first one in the trilogy.  It is a good, easy read.  A good love story.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|I did not expect this game to be as much fun as it is. It is like a air hockey in many ways but watching the various animals and cutting the ice around them... who would have thought this was fun... ??
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|Ok, movie.  You really have to follow closely and probably watch it two or three times to catch everything that's going on.  Easy to understand why it received the nominations it did, however I think generally it's overrated.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I love Community so much! This first season starts out slow, just like any other show trying to find its footing. But if you can get passed that, then you will find one of the best comedies on TV ever.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|A few of the scenes are really good 3D, but I expected more from the 3D in the air combat scenes.  The picture quality is not as good as most BluRay movies, I'm sure because it was filmed before digital technology was being used.  Maybe I just expected too much, but still all-in-all a great movie.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|love everything on it this CD! though i still sometimes wish that they didn't shorten a few of the songs, but that's not a huge issue.<br />it was delivered on time and in perfect condition, so i'm a happy camper :)
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Truly enjoy TWC app, and the alert's timeliness and range of weather conditions and options for various locations during travel.
1840226447|5.0|The pros: Beautiful romantic prose. A premise that is quite threatening to the reader. Poetic horror that manages to reach much farther than just horror.<br /><br />The cons: If you're not familiar with 19th century writing (say, Edgar Allen Poe) you will have to adjust to the slightly stilted approach.<br /><br />Recommendation: Buy it. It's worth taking a chance because it is evocative and unique.
1933865474|5.0|The book has many colorful pages with different form of vixens which give you an idea of different angle and concept to draw figures. The style of drawing is different from other vixens books which exposes you to various forms and technics
0345803485|5.0|After all the hype of this book, when I read it I was pleasantly surprised at the narrative quality of the story. It drew me into the twisted love affair that Grey and Ana are having and I rooted for them as a couple! I read this book in a day after not reading anything for 2 years. I had to find out what happened next, so I bought the second and third ones. The second is the best in my opinion. Not just a bunch of vulgar erotic scenes, but a beautifully written account of an odd relationship.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The second season of Downton Abbey is fantastic. Drama, romance, and scandal all occur with the typical Downton Abbey flair.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicolas Sparks! He didn't disappoint. I love the romance and edginess he lead in the book. Must read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was really good it was just like temple run which is a good thing it is just epic wow
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love this game! its a lot of fun and very addicting! and its free! you cannot go wrong! the puzzles get better and better!
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|This album is a must-have for any Mraz fan! It's awesome to hear a live recorded concert and as such not only do you get the energy of the show, but you get to hear some old favorites and some new ones too!! Plus, if you ever get tired of just listening you can pop the DVD in and watch!!!<br />Buy this album NOW!!! :)
B002ZG98C8|3.0|Lousy movie, didn't like the ending either.  Steven Segal was not at his best in this movie.  Lousy, I like him  better as the hero.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|Draw Infinity is the first Drawing/Photo Editing app I've tried so I can't compare it to other similar apps, but I can give you a newbie's opinion...<br /><br />On the photo editing side I thought it was pretty decent.<br /><br />Photo Editing Positives:  you can do the basic stuff like red-eye reduction, rotating, cropping, flipping, and you can also make some photo enhancements to things like brightness, contrast, etc.  There is a basic \\"blemish\\" options that lets you blur an area to hide blemishes.  This is an okay tool, but what the app really needs is a replicate/clone tool (like Photoshop) that would allow you to copy one part of the image and paste it over another part.<br /><br />Photo Editing Negatives: I really disliked the fact that there was no UNDO button.  After you hit \\"apply\\" there is no going back.  I also had issues with the back button.  I found myself accidently pressing the back button (before applying my changes) and losing all of my work.  There needs to be a confirm option that warns you that if you proceed all changes will be lost.<br /><br />Unlike the photo editing side (which I thought was okay), I see several limitations on the Draw side:<br /><br />*  There is no undo button and the pesky back button caused me to lose my edits several times. (see above)<br />*  There are no standard shapes that you can use (ie: squares, circles, stars) .  Everything must be drawn freehand.<br />*  You can't change the font of the text.<br />*  You can change the width and color of the draw tool, but you can't change the style or the transparency.<br />*  There are no layers so you can't change the order of your objects.<br />*  And my biggest issue with the draw component of the app is that once you place a text item or draw a line are stuck with it.  You can't go back and re-edit the text, change its location, color, or delete it all together if you decide later that you don't want it there.<br /><br />I know I'm asking a lot for a 99 cent app (or even free since it is the FAOTD), but some of the stuff (like the shapes) seems pretty basic and a must have in any drawing app.  Just my 2 cents.free since it is the FAOTD), but some of the stuff (like the shapes) seems pretty basic and a must have in any drawing app.  Just my 2 cents.
B008NEMPTO|3.0|none-the-less it is a decent movie - over the top of course, just wish it didn't lack some of my favorite parts of the book. If you are looking for something &#34;not over the top&#34; walk away - otherwise enjoy the movie, it make no excuses for it's boldness and matrix like fight scenes.
B003SHUMRI|3.0|First of all-- I never saw it on amazon streaming cause the movie didn't stream onto my computer and I had to see a poorer quality on YouTube. But , although its fun to see Channing Tatum 'before', the movie lacks the sheer breath-taking spectacle of the later Step Up movies, especially \\"Revolution\\"(#4). The movies are all entertaining; I just think the latter ones really got it right.
B0083EXW50|3.0|Listened to it a few times and it has 3 pretty good songs, the rest feels like fillers. As far as I know since the drummer could not make the recording, they used a drum machine and it just is lacking at some points. I still go to see them live when they are down here, I think there is a show in the very near future if Im not mistaken. I liked Mechanize better than this album. Other than a song here and there nothing comes close to the first 3 albums Fear Factory has released. Im curious if the re-release of Soul of a New Machine has Big God/Raped Souls with a better recording. Love that song, but sounds terrible in this day in age recording quality wise.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great read about a soldier working with, and fighting along side the other heros of our nation.  He will be missed!
B004QMRHHW|5.0|I like the album a lot. Most of Amon Amarth's last offerings have been pretty solid. If you like those, then I think your gonna like this as well. The Cover of Arials is just awesome alone. The great thing about amazon is you can get a sample listen of parts of the song. All of them are on youtube if you want to hear the entire thing before you make a purchase.
B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|I listen to it every moring with my yoga routine.  Its a melodic symphany that will get you energized and keep you calm at the same time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such an easy read  I couldn't put my kindle down. Looking forward to my next Nicholas Sparks book!<br />Very good book.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is a quality case for my Kindle Fire. It works great and fits my kindle very nicely. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0064QNS62|3.0|It's okay because you REALLY gotta know how to use and move your fingers pretty fast to controle Marv correctly. You also gotta know were the buttons are without looking.
0761169253|5.0|A must read for all artists and a motivational read for anyone looking to be more creative. very sound advice!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|What a set of pipes. Haunting, uplifting, she runs the full gamut on this album. Glad I picked this up.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cord works better than the one that came with the Kindle. There ia a better protective  piece  at the connection  between  the wires and the part that connects to the Kindle. I would recommend that everyone who buys  Fire buy this cord too.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|Manuscript Found in Accra is a message for the soul in the modern day that has transcended from ancient times.  It is amazing that ancient words remain so meaningful through all these years and is proof that no matter modern we think our society has become there will remain through time the common core of human reaction.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I first heard the song &#34;Buzzkill&#34; on youtube and I knew I had to come look up the rest of the songs. Although this was my first Luke Bryan &#34;Spring Break...&#34; CD, it was not my first Luke Bryan CD. This is a man who knows what his fans want and he knows how to give it to them, as evidenced by his recent winning of the 2013 Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year Award. Plus he puts out one hell of a CD and puts on one hell of a live show as well!!!
030759565X|5.0|She just love what she does and you can taste that devotion, every recipe is working nicely. In our family several of them became a holiday favourite.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I spend much of my day on a compute and it is so convenient to have a dictionary at my immediate disposal.
B009R659L8|5.0|It is like picking up a very good friend. Thank you Mary Higgins Clark for having one more book in you. You have kept me turning the &#34;pages&#34;(of my Kindle) as you always have. So many twist and turns. Thank you!
B00B2166BS|3.0|Does what its supposed to do for the price. I expected the magnet to be a little more strong. They came off easily even if the cable is twisted. Can't go 2ways-not a big deal but I do have to flip sides each time I get it wrong.<br /><br />I needed this since the micro-usb port was acting quirky when charging already  and I didn't want to spoil it all the way.
B007GE2H3G|3.0|This movie was amazing to look at but the story was fairly boring.  I love this type of movie, but it really needed a more compelling story.  Certainly reminiscent of the world during WWII era.  Just needed something more.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This dvd set continues to be comedy at its best.  I love the characters and situations; always makes me laugh.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This season, in my opinion, is the most intense, suspenseful, and thrilling. I would suggest this to anyone who has seen the seasons before it.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is the only sitcom on TV that actually makes me laugh out loud!  If I feel down, I'll put in a disk, and it always cheers me up.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have never been much of a fan of musicals, I wasn't sure I would like this movie (LesMiserables) but found myself enjoying it very much. Anne Hathaway,Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were all wonderful in this movie.
B008220C38|2.0|I love the original Anna Karenina, this was so different; a great disappointment.  I didn't even finish watching it and I'm planning on selling it.  So not what I thought it would be
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Really didn't know much about this movie (Life of Pi) just what I heard at the academy awards. I have to say I enjoyed it very much. Didn't know anything about the actors either but I thought the young star was very good.
B004GYY714|1.0|I would rate it in the low range because when you install it there are so many advertisements that pop up when using this app and SUCKING you BANDWIDTH it slows your system down lucky my system is a duel core system .<br /><br />They do NOT tell you it will have all this GARBAGE advertisements in it before you install it. even when you uninstall it there is still GARBAGE left behind in your system<br /><br />Would NOT recommended this unless you have a fast connection and dont mind GARBAGE POP UPS
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Just watched Django with Jamie Foxx and was surprising good a little bloody for my taste but very good story line. Have to say I liked it very much and can understand why it was nominated for for an Academy Award.
B00AEFYL6K|5.0|I  LOVED THIS MOVIE, I DON&#34;T KNOW WHAT MORE I CAN SAY. I REALLY LIKED JAMES STEWART, HE WAS KIND OF FUNNY, HE PUT&#34;S HIS WHOLE HEART IN HIS FILMS. IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE !!!!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was very fascinating ,uplifting and medically scientific. Many of us have questions that will remain unanswered in our hearts and minds until the actual time of our passing. It is up to each individual to have the &#34;faith&#34; and believe in an &#34;everafter&#34; or &#34;Heaven&#34;.  The first book that I read about NDE's was &#34;Heaven is for Real: A Little Boy's Trip to Heaven and Back&#34;, which was truly amazing. It is my opinion that the episodes of the experiences that these individuals had are true and remarkable. There are too many &#34;coincidences&#34; for them to be denied.
B000059H98|5.0|The movie is based on the comic &#34;Tank Girl&#34;. What happens when the water dries up and what is still out there is controlled by Water and Power? Well, a quick witted heroine and her awesome sidekick. This movie is a fun romp, great music and the acting is right on. Lori Petty was the perfect pick for the part of Tank Girl, her sense of timing is great and the one liners keep coming. Rising against oppression has never been so fun. However there is a dark undercurrent as well, a child is stolen and Tank Girl is off to rescue. Malcolm McDowell is the villain in this movie and you can tell how much he relished the part, putting the smarmy into evil all the way. It does have nudity, dialog is adult oriented, cartoon-like violence and lots of attitude. The cast is brilliant. I wish they would do a second movie, in the meantime the comics are out. I would recommend it to people that like smart comedies with an edge. Also those that love Campy movies.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This is a great sequel to a great book. Definitely would recommend this  series and can't wait to read the next book!
076535618X|5.0|Big fan of these characters and the setting. As soon as I'm done with one book from this series, I buy the next.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Funny movie but I fell it went to far with comedy aimed at social norms. Cheap shots a others expense.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Don't read reviews before you read this. Engrossing all the way through. Understand other reviews about the ending being anticlimactic but think it fit the characters.
B00594XOZU|4.0|When I first got it it was amazing because my friend had it and we made a group conversation. I thought it was flawless until I pressed the button that kik can find you friends but it doesn't so that is the only flaw it has. Overall it is pretty good.
B009VB97EY|1.0|The shipping and price was great but the movie really was pretty bad.  I heard so much great things about it, I couldn't believe I disagreed once I saw it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have nothing but good things to say about this show its absolutely amazing and it is so well done. the acting and the story couldn't be better and you really good hooked since the first episode. So do your self a favor and watch the show ps I am 25 year old straight male and I love this show ladies if your man doesn't want to watch it with you tell him to grow a pair and get over thinking this show is gay. Alright enough said people rent it buy it do what ever it takes just watch it.
1616550414|5.0|I heard this book was coming out very recently and bought it on a whim. My friend finished it reading the book the same day he received it. Said he loved it.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Love the music but have to ignore cuss words. He is a talented artist who captures the essence of southern country boys
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|Many laughs.. Very true to life events.. Pretty realistic.. Still kept us laughing from start to finish.. Very good acting.. They are a good pair to work together.
B006P96PAO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie greatly, because it showed something of how real people of faith live real lives. These Christians are shown doing funny things, and hurtful things, and good things, and bad things. Their lives are not perfect, but they are pressing forward, honest about their faults, and serious about loving people. Life is hard for everyone, and the film portrays this, not even shying away from portraying the horrible failure of one of the main characters, and the cost not only for him but also for his friends. In all, the characters in the film want to do good in order to honor the God who sacrificed His Son for them, and they find it difficult at times, especially when it might cost them their livelihood or their relationships. But most of them push through, nonetheless, to do what they should: take responsibility for a child fathered out of wedlock; inform on a friend in the police force who is stealing evidence; refuse to participate in &#34;creative accounting&#34; in a factory situation.<br />Admittedly this is not Dustin Hoffman, Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep, but the actors and actresses do a solid job, the camera work is good, the story is compelling (to me at least), and the company seems to get better with each movie they do. I hope they keep it up.
1402756399|5.0|This book is a nice annotated version of Darwin's Origin of Species. The quality of printing you get for the price is amazing. Suppose you get the bang for the buck, so to speak, because its printed in China. Overall Im very happy with my choice.<br /><br />Unfortumately the reviews that allowed me to correctly make this informed choice have been mixed up between this true to Darwin version of the book and the other, which is aparently studded with creationost nonsense. I tend to think the mixing of rewiews was purposeful, done by creationist \\"appologists\\" who wanted to confuse buyers. I wouldnt put it past the kind of people who are guided (blinded) by faith to use whatever means necessary to bring people into their apocalyptic fold.<br /><br />Whatever the reason for the mess, I hope amazon corrects it. It's plainly obvious that the text from the negative reviews are a copy and past job from the creationost version since the banana creationist guy's name isn't even in the info section of this book.<br /><br />To repeat, THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE. This is the historically accurate, scientifically sound, propaganda-less 150th anniversary edition of origin of species. This is the one you want to buy.<br /><br />And to the idiots who concocted this mixup: the rational, thinking, people, who buy this book wont fall for the kind of tricks you yahoos do, because they can see when a claim does or doesnt fit the data.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It looks so real. I want to keep riding the horse. I love grooming and mocking out the stables
B0096HL33G|1.0|Had high hopes for this movie b/c Rachel Weisz is usually a good actress. It was so dull, boring in the first few minutes that I turned it off.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie!!!! Deviates from the true story some but delivers the story in general. Never slow, suspenseful, good acting and finishes well.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Like many Americans I'm hooked on the lives at Downton Abbey. Sometimes torn between who I want to succeed more- the Upperclass family or the &#34;downstairs&#34; servants. Amazingly well written and acted because I can keep up with 20+ characters in one episode and not feel like I'm missing anything.
0060763280|5.0|This book is easily one of my favorites, the author uses some metaphysical theories to help the reader understand the mind of a millionaire
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Love both of these actors and the story kept me guessing until the end. A well intentioned movie about how our life choices can be made for us or against us with our very own permission.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I loved this game for a long time And now I can get it! this is a delly cool game it is creative and cool! everyone should buy it
B0058W74UY|2.0|I think this product will not be useful at all because it is difficult to use. In addition, it doesn't support the video, movie, and music very well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had this on my computer for long time and now its on my Kindle! its a creative game I now have a world that everywhere you go you see millions of things! there's no reason not to buy this
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|An ending to the best and most wonderful world, there will never be another as true and perfect. I do not mourn the loss for it is never the end, just an end and  a master such as Robert Jordan will come again as will a new beginning to an ending come again as the Wheel turns.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Such a great show. The writing is phenomenal. I will warn you it's got a lot of language, gratuitous nudity, a some of the most graphic violence I've seen in film lol. None of which bothers me, but for as much medias as I've consumed over the years, I was still somehow surprised at the levels of all of it. There'll be scenes with important dialogue, meanwhile the supporting cast will be moaning so loud I begin to wonder what my neighbors think I'm watching lol. But you can't turn it down b/c of the conversation...oh well.<br /><br />The costume design, dialogue, and world they've created are spectacular. I don't usually do this but I even watched the special behind the scenes stuff after I finished the season (spoilers). They really go all out to immerse you in the world. Which...isn't completely based on reality, but borrows a lot from real cultures then mixes in a bit of magic. But not enough to call it a fantasy. It never feels like the main focus of the show, but it's definitely a strong undercurrent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Its is great so far.i absoulutley love it. Suzanna collins is great. I want to meet her in real life!!!

The dynamics of the show shift compared to season one and I just favor the other. But I'm sure it'll change again in the next season. Still 5 stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What  way to begin a trilogy, Strong in love, in sex and very riveting.  I love Anna & Christian.  They mad a great couple and I hope that you have more to come.  Everyone loves the first and also I. WOW, Hot, Hot, Hot

B0064MGU98|5.0|The story lines are great! Can't wait to see what's going to happen next in the episode. Captures your attention.
0547848412|5.0|I first started listening to this book on the ipod and then read the last portion.  It is well-written and the story is engaging.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One could dismiss this as Robinson Crusoe on mars from the 'blurb' but it's far better.  It was a .99 cent special, after reading it I'll pay full price for Weir's next effort.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I read this book in jr high school that was 10-11 yrs ago! I remembered it! Found it again and re-read it! I love this book and I believe if you want to read about something fiction and scientific at the same time this is a great book. So take the time see what it is about, I bet it will move you in your heart as well!!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Well done yet depressing, because ultimately this war made us do things we should never do. Torture, kill women and children. Still, though I knew the outcome, I found it suspenseful. Well acted, beautifully made. For me, worth watching.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Have had an account with yahoo for years great way to keep in touch be notified and keep up with friends and family
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I sort of enjoyed it, but it relied too much on shock value to be really good. Acting was good.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather  It is easy to change to any location while traveling making it a great way to know how to dress accordingly and what to be prepared for.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This was a good book.  I enjoy the authors  way of phrasing and describing events, locations. etc.  I will choose<br />to read her books any time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Just used it on an international vacation very handy!!!! Don't know how I ever got along without it. Won't leave home without it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game improves every aspect of the original and adds more features to keep your interest.  Only thing missing is more than one level/stage.
B009G41CG2|4.0|I really like playing Mahjong.  I wish that I could pick the format of the game instead of it being random

B004SBQAL0|5.0|We have seen plot elements from I Am Number Four many times before.  There are a few parts of the story that are downright silly.  The premise of this movie is interesting though.  The storyline of escaping to the Blue Planet and trying to hide amongst the population does not get a lot of screenplay.  Despite critics' scathing reviews of this movie, it is clean fun.  While reading the reviews, the complaints about the acting left me puzzled.  This movie never portends to attract an adult audience.  I never put it into the Blu-ray player expecting to see an award winning movie.  This is a young adult targeted movie that adults can enjoy as well.  The more science fiction movies are dissed, the less likely we are to see them produced in the future.  Grab a soda, turn off the lights and enjoy this one.

B008ASGP3U|4.0|Rebus' new investigation takes him out of his usual city haunts and into the Scottish countryside.  There is both complexity and a simple directness in this tale of multiple murders that have occurred over a period of time. Rebus applies his intuition along with dogged persistence as he unravels the key to the mystery.

B00B23O96A|1.0|Never been a fan....saw him with CREAM circa 69 in germany and later on 2 tours of OZZ and he was aweful on each occasion. How many 'favourite songs' cd's can you release without looking like the fake he is. This might be one too many and represents the lowest point of his tainted career. Hope he can stop now.

B00B1E6DEQ|5.0|Undoubtedly one of the best bands in the world and maybe their best cd to date. After the extraordinary NEW REVOLUTION, I was not sure what they could do to top that one. Well here it is and it once again shows what ROCK / POP can sound like when created by these amazing talents. Killer hooks and every song gets into your head and compells you to sing ( not a good thing in my case ). Never mind the stink eye response to my enthusiasm, I just can't help myself. Will take some doing to topple this from the BEST OF 2013 throne.
0385349831|3.0|This book was so not what I was expecting. Perhaps had I known more about Mr. Coelho I would have known what I was getting. Perhaps had I read the synopsis more closely. I don't know. I was expecting a story, what I got was so much less and yet so much more.<br /><br />As I've stated many a time in the course of my reviews I am not one for sussing out deep meaning within the pages of books. I read to be educated, to be entertained or to just get away from things for a bit. I don't read to look for allegorical meanings in things or to sit and think philosophical thoughts. My mind does not work that way; it's kind of a \\"shortest distance is a straight line\\" kind of mind although it has been known to take the occasional meander along the winding road.<br /><br />I read Manuscript Found In Accra through rather quickly and then realized it's really not a book to be read in the traditional sense. It's a book to be picked up now and again and thought about at moments when you want to do a bit of sitting and thinking. After the initial set up of the finding of the manuscript - which I must admit is what had me so excited to read the book. I was all up for a story about old papyri and Biblical controversy. - it segues into the the questions and answers from this young philosopher, the Copt. He gives his thoughts on what are really eternal questions regarding war, peace, love, luck, sex, life, etc. The purpose is to carry the sense of Jerusalem forward to a time when it lives again in Peace.<br /><br />As if any of us will see that in our lifetimes.<br /><br />I can't say I liked this book and I can't say I didn't. This is a very hard one for me. It is the most different book I've read since I started reviewing books. It certainly made me think and I suppose that is it's purpose.
B00A72989U|5.0|I'm a fan of Alicia Keys and I've always admired the talent she possesses! She &#34;has the power&#34; to move and inspire people! Great music that comes thru in her songs that touches my soul! I would recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates music!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Loved it! A must for anyone who knows good music and bands. Dave Grohl really brings light to what it was like to make music using real talent.
B00004W50T|5.0|I had this album, back in the 70's when I was in high school, and was feeling nostalgic<br />so I bought the CD. If you love The Band, you can't go wrong with this CD. I was excited that it came with bonus tracks too. Great music!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|A fun game, challenging and addictive.  I keep going back to beat my score (or my husbands).  I'm enjoying it.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|good story and excellent costumes. too much graphic sex and violence, a HBO trademark.  acting good for most part.  the end/
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Great story and pics about the Salt Mines in Poland-just beautiful. I don't believe I would have come across this type of information anywhere else.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is the best spiritual book that fill the gap and clarify the teaching from both the West and the East.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|This game is actually really addicting and fun, but its not good for kids. The shark eats people and it shows blood. That's the bad part. The good part is that it has great graphics and the controls are fantastic! You can tilt your device to move the shark, or you can use your finger. I think that's pretty cool. Another cool thing is you can earn coins to buy food for your shark and you can buy different sharks that are bigger and better. Great game!
B005ES11M4|5.0|These Crocs are great foe outside work. Thick gripping soles. They look great with jeans! I tend to grab these for yard work.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I find this show simply outstanding and so enjoyable!  I don't know how I can wait for Season 4 to start!
B0064MGU98|3.0|The drama is well acted and very interesting.  Too  explicit (depictions of sex, homosexuality, bondage) for any family viewing in my home so I am stopping at season 1
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|worth waiting for, fans of Tolkien will like it epic fantasy.  Great special effects and characters hope they follow through with the rest of the series
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I have to start by saying that I didn't end up finishing the movie... It was enjoyable, but never really grabbed my attention. Good cast though!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The best show I have seen in years.  Everything about it is outstanding.  I loved it.  Recommend it hightly. Loved by all
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|Bought for a friend, kind of long, but overall an intriguing storyline.  Oh, and lots of nudity, definitely a little more than expected!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so so fun I never can stop playing it. You can buy characters and the dumb part is you have to buy things but it's stoll pretty good.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Better graphics and so much action. I couldn't believe it was amazing there are other gameloft games but this is #2 game that I had played.
B00B69UQEO|1.0|After listening to the album I can not remember any song. Monotony melodies , performed on a single chord, just terrible. David's vocals barely recognizable. This is the most boring album of the group.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is written in such a way as to compel the reader to keep reading, even though the &#34;writers&#34; at various times throughout the novel are supposedly 5th graders, or occasionally, older children. Only a cretin would fail to be emotionally touched by this book. Indeed this novel is an emotional experience and well worth the very enjoyable time to read it.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Childhood favorite with fun songs and a powerful story of family, gender roles, and the heart of a young one!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I saw their concert on our PBS channel.  It was sooooo AWESOME..  Fell in love with them.  Had to get the CD and now I can't quit listening to it.  These guys are really awesome.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It started slow and had to fill in some of the unknown rules for the Hunger Games, but once it got started it was better.  I'm still wondering if I want to continue the story.  I probably will because I hate to end a story in the middle of it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would give it six stars if it were possible.  I absolutely loved the twists and turns of this season.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander makes a strong scientific argument that his near-death experience was real, not imagined. His description is consistent with other reports, but with sufficient new elements to reduce the likelihood that he is simply parroting the experiences of others.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|Daughter loves how they go on an adventure to save the tortoise's spirit.  She enjoys finding the stars.  She likes how they care about the tortoise so they go save him. (My daughter is 8 yrs. old)
0385349947|5.0|What an amazing book. This woman will open your eyes to new perspectives you haven't considered before. She covers many topics and covers all her bases - it's hard to disagree because she presents tons of evidence, personal experiences and logical arguments. This book is inspirational and informative.<br /><br />It is also my favourite leadership book so far.  I think it's an excellent read for both men and women as it offers great advice for professionals in every stage of their career for moving up the leadership ranks - and who better to know than Sheryl Sandberg - the woman who made Google and Facebook what they are today.  It's an easy and super interesting read. And makes for great dinner conversation.  I highly recommend it!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I would not say that this book is as good as some reviews I read but it is worth reading. Its definitely not Hunger Games but somewhat along those lines.
B00633W614|5.0|I'm anxiously awaiting the third book of this trilogy which is coming in May.  I've pre-ordered and can't wait for the release.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|this show, while good emotioanlly, is pretty much loke many other lawyer shows... I hope the rest of the series is more exciting?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We Love this show wish it never ended, new eposide every week. Can't wait till next season, hope the storyline stays strong
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|good movie from a great book good actors and secenery. there are 2 more.<br /><br />hope the sequel is as good we will see......
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun little game.  It is a great escape from the daily routine and there is room for some creativity.  My granddaughter loves it too.
B003E88TKS|2.0|Not very good, fell asleep twice.  Ick I didn't like it, I didn't like it I didnt like it. EW
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As others have said, similar to the game Myst. Very intriguing, and I had a hard time putting it down. Waiting patiently for more from these developers.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I had no idea what life was like in North Korea previous to reading &#34;Nothing to Envy.&#34; Barbara Demick's absorbing account gives an understanding of history, politics, commerce, and tells the compelling stories of several individual North Koreans. It is a fascinating, strange, sad, and sometimes inspiring tale.  It is a timely read with what is currently going on with North Korea on the world's stage.
B000SFD21Q|4.0|It's easy to disregard the relationship between exercise and our cognitive alertness.  It would be nice to think that we could find a less taxing way of stimulating and regenerating our minds without the pain or stress of movement.  But there are far too many benefits to moderate exercise to ignore or to treat lightly.<br /><br />Realizing more about the science of exercise and how it affects our long term ability to learn was motivating and encouraging.  It spurred me on to get more serious in my workout routines, going from an average of four days a week for 40-45 minutes to 6 days a week for 45-50 minutes.<br /><br />It's still painful at times, but the euphoria that I feel afterwards diminishes that memory and keeps me coming back for more the next day.  Having a workout buddy also keeps the experience fresh.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Not always believable, and a little annoying at times, but still an entertaining yarn. A good light read to take on holiday.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Very basic text. It's a good reference for beginners especialy the ones who does not hold an engineering or a computer science bachelor degree
B0047SF41G|4.0|Was great for the simple action, gore and overall tension the thin plot provides. I've watched it a couple different times while I was doing laundry or cleaning house, etc.
B005544V6A|5.0|My husband and i both enjoy this show.  Probably the only show ever created that we both look forward to watching.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This movie was loosely based on the original starring &#34;Ah-nold&#34;. It was decent. Mostly though, this movie was steeped in CGI which is pretty much what sold the movie. The action sequences were pretty well thought out, but I'm really getting tired of seeing Kate Beckinsale's characters done up nearly the same in virtually every movie she's in lately. Give her some military fatigues with cargo pockets, a gun belt, and some body armor and I'll believe she's on the warpath just a bit more than her running around in a skin tight onesie with no pockets and nowhere to put a weapon. It is what it is. Hollywood is running out of ideas so it would seem.
B000V7J82S|5.0|My First LP, and the audio is awesome. My kids didn't believe that big black disc could play music. The sound is great.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Wow, a very heavy rugged knife.  This will not let you down...  Also so many awesome mods can be done to improve depending on how you may use it.
B0072OFM28|5.0|nothing more needs to be said.  this was a great series and now I'm said its over.  Great product.. came on time. no problems at all
B009IEXKXI|4.0|i liked this story was so human the main character i feel every dicision he made in order to survive,  was funny, well writing by mr. weir . the end was a little down. but enjoy this book very much.
B003L77FYS|5.0|My wife got me hooked on Castle and am I glad she did. This is a fun show where the interaction among the characters (to me) attributes to the show's success. Always based upon a murder, I do try to guess who did it and why; but to me the entertainment comes from watching the characters interact. Beckett & Castle are priceless and their work together contributes to the show's success. The writters have done a fantastic job and their imaginations are beyond expectation. Monday night Castle is my favorite show.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|Maybe it is cause I'm new this app but I don't see how with tools given you can do anything remotely close to the screen shoots. I also haven't figured out how too keep what I just did while i go back and forth from drawing, text, and effects. That bothers me. Luckily I got on free app of the day so. Maybe it is just me but I really don't get it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have been swept up in the clamor for another fix of DA. What a pleasure to see a piece of work/art crafted perfectly. It warms my heart- took quite awhile to put my finger on what it was above and beyond the obvious quality that so attracted me. At last I got it! It's the way they characteristically treat one another with courtesy. Man, I've forgotten what that looked like!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching this series about a week ago off of netflix and I am so addicted now that I HAD to buy this season! Almost done with it and I am definitely not disappointed with this season at all! Also, the streaming quality is very good and I only bought the SD version.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|With the new Facebook Home, Facebook has once again showed us how it wants our information, keystrokes and habits for resale.  Facebook has become the local water cooler for the planet but at the same time has become its own worst enemy.  You need it, you want it, but you also want it to stop changing itself weekly, updating its policies and give us back control of our content.  And the ads...good grief...  Who cares about boots, alcohol, gay hook up sites, vacation destinations that have no redeeming qualities or car companies that love bail out money.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|I always liked this movie so I got my own copy.  It's the DVD version I wanted, cheap and not really hard to find
B00008WT5M|5.0|Memorable catchy riffs, perfect rhythm, and the most powerful singing out there prove you don't need to reinvent the wheel stylistically speaking when a band is this good.  Though he's always great, I think this is Brian's best album vocally.  Chris Slade does a good job taking over for Simon on drums.  Can't go wrong with this album.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I mainly wanted to be able to play the larger worlds in Civ 4.  For my home use this is an economical screamer.
B005IQZB14|3.0|This writer is brave about revealing her flaws as well as strength.  I felt the book exploited the current fad for &#34;failure&#34; books--&#34;Oh, see what a bad girl I've been,&#34; to make the subsequent achievements look better.  Many of the difficulties of the trip could have been avoided if the writer did even minimal research.  What does that say about her intelligence?  Yet she writes very well.  The combination seems somewhat incredible.  I kept reading, though--she held my interest.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun....makes time fly by when u are bored. You can have a friendly competition with your friends. Win achievement awards.
B00B69UQEO|1.0|I'd rather listen to the Red Hot Chili Peppers for 24 hours straight than listen to this album again. Ok, maybe that's a bit of hyperbole, but seriously Delta Machine is awful. Gahan just sort of meanders through a slew of uninspired, boiler plate nursery rhymes that, I suppose, he thinks are decent lyrics, and worst of all, he just sort of let's them lazily dribble out of his mouth in this monotone hum that is both boring, and unpleasant at the same time.<br /><br />I know what you're thinking, \\"No way anything DM can be that bad.\\" I assure you it is, and I'm a huge DM fan! The whole reason I bought the CD and not the MP3 was so I could get the presale to buy tickets to see them! Needless to say, that won't be happening anymore. I spent the money on Coachella I stead.
B0058W74UY|1.0|It does not do what I expected.  I was expecting it to work like Adobe Flash Player and it doesn't.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. I was disappointed the 3 season wasn't free to prime customers. I would absolutely recommend it.  It is great to watch a show and not worry about language or sex.  It is left to the imagination which is better.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|A clear history amidst the many historical fictions in publication. An interesting read as well.<br /><br />Read this book if you want the facts and want to know what really happened between Henry and his wives.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was great book by a true American Hero! Goes into detail about ops in Iraq, very interesting. A must read for all military and gun buffs.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Very pleased with this purchase.  We ordered it for a Catan party we were hosting at our house, and it came right on time, as promised.  It was brand new, in the original packaging and everything.  This price is a lot cheaper than other places I looked, too.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I bought this for my husband, but i enjoy it too! I bought it for one song and ended up liking the whole album!
B008M721MS|1.0|Cannot get beyond my profile page so have not been able to Skype anyone since installing Skype. Am rather disappointed.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Loved the book definitely recommend to any one who likes a Good fantasy. Will most definitely buy more books from this series
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show. Have watched it beginning to end at least three times. I really can not wait for the next season to come out.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|I enjoyed this book once I got into it but it did take approximately half of the novel for it to really move.
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this book years ago.  My 13 year old son is an avid reader and I am trying to find interesting books to keep it that way.  I thought I would buy DaVinci Code for his Kindle and see what happened.  He got into it right away and he keeps telling me how good it has gotten!  A great feeling to share great reads with my son!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|i loved this series. could not wait to see the next in the series. i recommended to good friends of ours.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The children in my family enjoyed this movie - Wreck-It Ralph - ages 4-12 yrs. It was worth the money to rent it for the afternoon's entertainment and the giggles that came from the room full of kids watching it together.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Fine ongoing story and sparkling weekly story. Casting is so natural that you think they are real. You'll even learn something new about our legal system.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Spell binding - can't wait until Season 4 on PBS!  Actually makes you feel as if you're living in that era of post World War I England!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|my 5.5 year old loves this movie and his little sister at almost 3 likes it as well.<br />we will be getting the books for them to read soon.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Wanted to see this older version before I went to see new one. I really enjoyed it. Totally held my attention.
B004H1U2HE|5.0|Not only is this memmoir exquisitely written (and translated) but it succeeds in taking you to a moment and place in time that was pivotal in the history of Isreal. When a  first person account is presented so decisively, it places the reader exactly there. I found his self deprecation appealing and honest. He zeroes on cerain defining moment in his early life and writes about them, sometimes in great detail. Thank you Mr. Oz for sharing your world with me.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I prefer the app over the website.  it's so much easier to use the filters in the app, especially for sorting out sold products.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|A little strange, but then MIB is just that strange.  Casting for the younger &#34;K&#34; character was brilliant, he even sorta looked like he could be the younger version.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Even if you don't like strategy games, you will like this.<br />I got it on a lark and was not expecting to become so engrossed in it.<br />Kudo's to the indie developer who came up with this.  It's original, replayable, fun and not mindless.<br />I can't wait for the next virus!!!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Another great action movie with some great actors.  Even had some surprise actors show up in the film.  A little gory, but have come to expect that in action movies these days.
030758836X|2.0|This book starts so well; tightly written and paced... and then it loses its way. After you get over the set-up, which is admittedly clever, there are plot holes you can drive a CSI van through. The forensics were laughable. Ultimately, however, you just don't care about either main character as they are almost equally loathsome and that just sets a book up to fail. You have to have a rooting interest in somebody. The pages don't turn themselves, and if you just don't care...
B001C08RHA|5.0|great movie.  I thought with all the superhero stuff it was going to be dumb, but actually a great movie.  Robert Downey Jr. is great as usual playing Tony Stark.  I just bought Iron Man 2 playing it tonight, hope its a good as number 1.
B00122N0GQ|4.0|Loved Depeche Mode back in the 90s. Hadn't listened to them in a while, but songs from this album kept coming up in Pandora. Often they would get stuck in my head for days, so got the album. The popular songs from the album are great, the less popular songs are quite darker, but still good; just not popular radio material.
B00BS4QP60|5.0|Great great album. Blake has an amazing voice and this is no acception. Great addition to his collection of discography!
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|If you are a fan of Volbeat, you have to buy this. If you are a fan of rock anthems, hard rock, thrash, metal, or nu-metal...YOU NEED THIS!!! Not the download, buy the CD, because you have to read these lyrics. The horror-western theme is genius. This IS a new classic!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was great! I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the next two books... I recommend this book to those who love a steamy romance.
B004LQA6MQ|5.0|I'm making my way back through the Alien series, rented this one and it was great. If your following the series and enjoy the movies, you will enjoy this one too.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I kept saying I don't like movies like this, but watched because my granddaughters gave it such high ratings. I have to say that it was intense, but I did really like it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is an AMAZING app! I definetly reccomend this app. Pinterest is similar to tumbler, but different in it own way. And a tip for everyone. GO TO SOCIAL NETWORKINGS to find the app.. (only reason for the caps was to get your attention.)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Added to my Kindle HD.  It is just what I was looking for to keep me in the know on my local weather conditions.
B000FA675C|5.0|Entertaining, and great use of history's mysteries!  Robert Langdon is a great character, and if you like Indiana Jones movies, you'll enjoy this book and the other Langdon-centric books. Great summer vacation reading.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I heard all about this movie from my mother-in-law so maybe I was expecting more because she was really impressed.  Overall, it kept my attention and had great graphics.  I feel like I missed that \\"aha\\" moment where God's existence was confirmed.  Maybe it was less obvious than I thought it would be.<br />Loved the graphics and Christian values!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great musical.  Would recommend to anyone.  My all-time favorite movie adaptation. Acting was excellent and the way they recorded the singing live made the show.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|This young man looked like he was searching for peace and happiness, it makes you wonder in the end if he would have eventually went home or let his parents know where he was. Very thought provoking, makes you think
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have to admit I was hesitant to purchase this book. I read a sample, read several reviews and stroll couldn't decide but I finally got to the point of curious past trepidation and purchased it. I read through the first book and mostly enjoyed it, then I read through this book and I really wasn't so sure. It wasn't until I read them through a second time that I really enjoyed them on there merits.<br /><br />Reflected in You takes a great deal of unexpected twists and turns. For those of you calling it a rip of Fifty Shades, I don't know where you are getting that from, but you are very wrong. I've read the Fifty Shades series several times and this has almost nothing in common with that story line or in the personality of the characters. Gideon, who people seem to either love or hate is a wounded soul, but not in the same way as Christian nor does Gideon deal with it as Christian does. Eva is not a naive college girl like Ana, she has her own experiences that shape her. If you are worried from other reviews that these books are a rip off let me tel you right now that they are not.<br /><br />Reflected in You brings us full circle. It sees Eva not just being a helpless damsel, but pursuing answers when Gideon won't give them to her. Eva is a force to be reckoned with all by herself. Gideon is protecting her in the best way that he knows how. The evolution of the side characters in this book is also well paced.<br /><br />I highly recommend purchasing this book and Bared to You. They will be books you can read over and over again.
B002RXMG00|4.0|It actually is better than I remembered.<br />In terms of the Amazon streaming, the video sometimes was a little jerky, as if it was stuttering. Don't know if that was the film or the streaming. We watched in HD. Given its age, probably should have just watched at a lower resolution.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|What this ap is capable of doing is nothing short of amazing to me. I'm no artist, but it makes me feel like I am! I've only been using it about a week, but what I've been able to create so far surprises me. My limitation is only the size of my Kindle 7&#34; - I'd love to have a bigger area to work on. I'm considering purchasing the SketchBook Pro for my PC so I can have a bigger work area. My goal is to write and illustrate childrens books. I'm still learning all the great things I can do with this. I wish it had a tutorial - its been trial and error, but I'm managing. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting more than just a doodling ap.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A beautifully written, lovely story, full of magic and evoking memories of reading Ray Bradbury as a child. While the heroes of the story are fantastical, powerful beings, they are also still human and fragile, ones with whom we can easily identify. I was inspired enough to begin a tradition of my own based on one in this book. A very different kind of fantasy, written with surprising strength and delicacy.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Could not put this book down.  Riveting story line.  Sometimes the flashback method of telling the story was hard to follow but I might read again to get every nuance.  Would definitely recommend.
B0064MGU98|5.0|So I have to say that there are to many &#34;legal&#34; dramas out there.  One might say, enough that you can get the equivalent of a TV law degree.  That being said, I originally had no interest in this show.  Bored one weekend, I decided to watch the pilot.  Then episode 2 and so on and so on.  Then I got my wife hooked on the show.<br /><br />This is a great drama, very well acted and good plot twists.  I would give this show a try.  I plan on watching season 2, and best of all it was part of Amazon Prime.
B006R1T40I|5.0|She really is the best of us - this album has some great music on it, and she stirs the soul as well as anyone, just listen to 'Not what I wanted to'. Thanks again Bonny, and another terrific Randall Bramblett song too - get his albums if you can, you won't be sorry!
B009KEN87O|4.0|This game has a nice nostalgic feel 2 it...good old fashioned space-shooter with the twist of touch action. Very challenging as levels progress.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie has mystery, wonder, truth, adventure and love.  I love this movie, I had to buy it.  A beautiful movie to hold on to.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|This Duets album is old school  -- beautiful melodies, compelling lyrics, wonderful vocals.  Paul Anka is in my judgement better today than when he started.  He really has not gotten his due as a performer/songwriter.  There are threee cuts from here that come off his 1998 A Body of Work CD.  Truthfully, they work well with the new recordings.  Duets with Gloria Estefan, Michael Buble and Dolly Pardon all work well.  \\"Think I am In Love Again\\" with Estefan could be a hit in a radio environment that supported quality and diversity over demographics.<br /><br />The duet with Frank Sinatra on \\"My Way\\" is an interesting and predictable choice.  \\"I really Miss You\\" is a lovely ballad that doesn't hold up as well.  Leon Russell's voice is gritty and rough compared to Anka's smooth vocal style.  I suppose on paper this sounded like a fun idea, unfortunately it just didn't pan out.  Tom Jones is playful on \\"She's A Lady\\" - making this a fun romp.<br /><br />Try this adult contemporary recording - its one of the best in 2013.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I just needed something quick to help me hang on to my slick iPhone 4S. It's very simple, very clean looking, very grippy, all while being unobtrusive enough to let the iPhone's aesthetics shine through. I've owned all those other expensive cases and I'd buy this one again.
1878424319|5.0|This book is very inspirational and encouraging.  I am putting what I read to practice.  It is a MUST read.
B008602KQI|4.0|I will admit I watched this movie out of boredom.  I never picked up the &#34;fever&#34;.  My friends who saw it loved it and were adamant that I watch it - I didn't listen.  I will say this move was worth watching.  I did like it very much.  I still don't see the big buzz it generated - but it is an excellent movie.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I enjoyed this so much, I can't wait for the next one!  The world is beautiful and reminds me of the miniature fairy gardens now popular!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I've had a very tumultuous relationship with Quentin Tarantino's films. At first I loved him, then &#34;Kill Bill&#34; came out and since I had very recently gone through a Japanese film bender, had seen every single movie that Tarantino referenced in that movie and it confused me. I didn't know if he was paying homage or just ripping them off, sometimes frame for frame. Long story short I was pissed off at him for YEARS due to my own ignorance. Of course after seeing several interviews I came to realize that I'm an idiot and he just really, really loves film. He loves ALL of them. The hig hbrow, the low brow, everything. It's clear in his mind that a movie should be entertaining above all else. Here's the thing: dude knows his film history, perhaps better than any other director working right now. I don't know how he did it, but he has somehow come up with something very rare. Fun movies. I think I have mental road rash from all the hype that gets synthesized when a new &#34;blockbuster&#34; comes out, I watch said movie and I'm pissed off.<br />He doesn't make blockbusters. He makes matinee style entertainment. Yet somehow, he has managed to make art. (Somebody shoot me for saying that)<br />Quentin Tarantino has dropped that he's considering retiring. After &#34;Basterds&#34; and &#34;Django&#34; he indeed could retire and his reputation is guaranteed.<br />&#34;Django&#34; oozes life from the very opening frame to the closing credits. There's so much in this film to love<br />Christoph Waltz is again beyond amazing. His &#34;dental wagon&#34; with the tooth on the giant black spring is hilarious and perfect.<br />I also have to point out his horse &#34;Fritz&#34;. Fantastic.<br />Jamie Foxx made possibly the smartest decision of his career by doing this movie I knew he could act, but this was beyond anything he's done before.<br />Don Johnson knocked it out of the park.<br />Finally, the real tough question is, who walked away with this movie; Samuel L Jackson or Leonardo Di Caprio?<br />Both sterling actors and in this film it was like watching a 15 round heavyweight knockout fight. Holy god were they both amazing here.<br />There's also Jonah Hill, Tom Wopat, etc.<br />As far as the plot I can't spoil it. Just a great movie. I liked Tarantino, then I HATED him, then I came to my senses, and after &#34;Basterds&#34; he was my favorite person on earth and now with &#34;Django&#34; I'd consider under the right circumstances taking a bullet for him. Of course if Joss Whedon or Michael Bay were around I'd simply use them as a human shield..r Leonardo Di Caprio?<br />Both sterling actors and in this film it was like watching a 15 round heavyweight knockout fight.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was fun!!!! It was nice and entertaining but it also<br />Faces you with a hard relity, one usually not very close but it is<br />Out there!!!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I kept hearing so much negative crap about this movie. Well surprise surprise I watched it and it was just fine.<br />At least that stupid shaky camera work from the previous films is gone. I hated that.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait to see season 3.  The story line is great and it keeps you wanting to come back for more.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|To think this film is based on a true story makes it all the more incredible,I have just read a sample of this true story called &#34; You changed my Life &#34; haven't yet purchased the Kindle book yet ! But I will,I shall be lending my copy to several friends I know who I believe would enjoy this film as much as I have done,their comments will be interesting ?
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Such a cute movie for kids about loyalty, relationships, forgiveness, etc.  Great for any age with no questionable topics or langage.  Thank you!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Thank you for the CD I ordered. It really came The Next Day. My husband is, ofcourse, always sweet to me, but now that I could give him this CD for his birthday I got extra hugs and kisses. However, after dancing to the music my ethically and socially concious and enlightened husband reminded me to be very strict with Amazon for its tax policies.<br /><br />As to the record itself, although the pieces were all wonderful, we especially liked: Where Are We Now, Valentine's Day, Boss of Me and The Stars are out Tonight.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This is a fantastic book. Great fast read that is very funny with Tina's signature perspective. She gives some great history on her time at SNL and the writing process there and at 30 Rock. Considering she has worked with so many people, I'd recommend it for fans of, not only her work, but to fans of people she;s worked with as well.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cant wait for season fout o begin. This has been my favorite show since it came on the tv
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|This is the first book of this series and I think it was the best.  The two lead characters are interesting and slightly different.  And, their relationship/courtship is satisfying.  Well worth the price
B003B02O7I|5.0|could easily be non-fiction with our present day society. Greed...dis-functional family's.......drugs and booze.....living life in the fast lane and being out of touch with reality....guilt.....lack of values and morals....it left me thinking that there is one color in the world that doesn't discriminate...and that's the color &#34;GREEN&#34;. Tragic but True.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Loved it all.  The story and characters can not be beat.  This is the best show on television ever, absolutely awesome!
B0074VTHKM|2.0|I feel it leans more towards the youth reader. As an adult it just didn't appeal to me. If your an adult an enjoy &#34;Harry Potter&#34; novels you may like it. But from my perspective it just didn't have enough adult &#34;meat&#34; in it.
B000FC1GJW|5.0|By the time I got to this book in the trilogy, I could not stop reading. The message of this trilogy was great and made me think. I highly recommend this book for people 11 yrs or older. I read the first book (The Golden Compass) to my 5th grade class for read aloud and most of my students were wanting more of course, but I wanted them to read the rest on their own, since the reading level of this trilogy is pretty high. I did have some students who finished the trilogy and couldn't wait to discuss the books with me. If you like epic journeys and science fiction like stories, you will like this trilogy.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I'm still reading this book, however I do find it very interesting.  I think it should be considered for 'required' school reading.  Puts an interesting outlook on life.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|I particularly recommend this book to any person involved in computer technology.<br /><br />I feel very identified with woz and once I started the book I couldn't stop reading.
1885167776|5.0|Your ONE THING  right now is to get  this book, read and take action on what is written. Gary and Jay outline the simple blueprint to have an extraordinary life !! It just takes you to start!! Great book and love all the research behind it!!! Well done would be 10 stars if Ratings went that high!!! Thanks Gary and Jay for a wonderful gift. Scott Crouch
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to read these books, but now I can't believe I waited so long! The first person narrative makes you feel like you are the young woman fighting for her life. If you haven't read these books yet, you need to start! I look forward to starting book 2.

B005J9ZDYK|5.0|Shaun the Sheep is something that the entire family will enjoy with your child, or grandchild. It is genius in that it has a great message without a word being spoken. Everyone should check it out, its entirely worth every penny.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Very smart movie. Enjoyed the scenery. Will watch the second one coming out soon. Recommend this movie to my friends.
