0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay, by acclaimed author Suzanne Collins, who also authored the Underland Chronicles and worked as a scriptwriter for various children's programs throughout her career, is the third and thrilling conclusion to the highly praised Hunger Games Trilogy. The series is inspired heavily by the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, and the barbaric animosity of the Roman Gladiator games. In the first book of the series, two children ranging from the ages of twelve to eighteen are selected to participate in the games in a fight to the death. In Catching Fire, the book shows what occurs to the main characters after they are forced to take part in their second Hunger Games. Now, as the conclusion to this breath-taking series arrives, in the first person viewpoint of the chivalrous protagonist Katniss Everdeen, whose tone and voice are as engaging as when we first encountered her in The Hunger Games, we see whether or not if some things are worth fighting for. Published by Scholastic Press, the book I am reviewing is 390 pages long, separated into three parts with nine chapters each for a total of 27, and contains no illustrations.<br />Taking place immediately after Catching Fire, in a future where North America exists as a post-apocalyptic country called Panem consisting of a rich Capitol and twelve (previously thirteen) surrounding districts, the protagonists Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have been separated. Katniss is rescued abruptly by the forces of the presumably annihilated District 13 and reunited with her sweet sister Prim, her mother, and her best friend, Gale, with who she is starting to harbor feelings towards. Meanwhile, Peeta is taken in by the clutches of the Capitol, the oppressive, leading force that Katniss is rebelling against, and interrogated by President Snow, the sadistic and psychopathic leader of the Capitol. Mockingjay has rich imaginative characters that serve as an example of the weaknesses of the human condition, and ultimately adds to the overall grandeur of the story.<br />  During the 75th Hunger Games in which Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are forced to take part in as they are the only eligible and capable victors from their district, Katniss is rescued by the forces of District 13, while Peeta is held captive by the Capitol. While in the underground dwelling that District 13 has taken to constructing, Katniss is told that she must become a symbol of rebellion against the Capitol, and infiltrate their defenses. During the course of the book, Peeta is rescued and brought to District 13, but is very different than what Katniss remembers. As the rebels begin to orchestrate their final assault on the Capitol, many lives are lost in the kerfuffle, and Katniss has to choose whether or not some people are worth trusting. Even your enemies.<br />  The themes that this book illustrates are hopefulness, such as in the face of war. Katniss serves as an icon of rebellion against the Capitol, and seeks freedom from their oppressive rule. Mockingjay demonstrates the concepts of betrayal, and how it's dealt with when others loyalties are hard to pinpoint. The morality of the decision of others are a force to be reckoned with, as Katniss also struggles to discover if her own choices are right or wrong. Another theme that is demonstrated in the book is perseverance, which Katniss has done ever since the death of her father to keep her family alive. Although she is faced with difficult choices and has the weight of an entire population on her shoulders, she perseveres and keeps walking towards the path that she thinks is right.<br />  Overall, I thought that this book was an amazing read. Suzanne Collin's voice keeps you engaged and excited for whatever lies on the next page. The ending wasn't completely satisfying, and at first I felt feelings of exasperation and bewilderment as I read the final sentence. However, after thinking about the events that had transpired and the overall setting and tone ofthe book, I came to the realization that in war it's highly improbable that everyone you know and love would all survive through it. Because of that realization, the story seemed to hold a greater impact on than it would if all the characters survived. This book captures the realistic views on war, and doesn't bother to hide the details with purple prose. The reality of the character's situations gives it a greater appeal, and people who have been through the harshness of war will give Mockingjay a commendable nod.e to the realization that in war it's highly improbable that everyone you know and love would all survive through it.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I saw some reviews where people thought it seemed \\"cheap\\".  I wholeheartedly disagree!  My Kindle Fire fits perfectly snug in the case, which appears to be of excellent craftsmanship.  The case is VERY light, but it seems to be \\"one\\" with the fire once attached.  My biggest concern ordering the case is that the cover would not close properly on the front of the device.  Much to my surprise, the case is so well made that it closes perfectly.  Aesthetically pleasing, to boot.  I love just to look at my device sitting in the case - is something wrong with me?  Could a Marware case really have caused me to fall head over heals in love with a chunk of metal and plastic crafted together in a factory thousands of miles away?  Is this how my life will end, gripping tightly onto my Kindle Fire which is wrapped snugly by a beautiful Marware case as I peacefully die in my sleep?  What is the purpose of life, if not to love the things around you?<br /><br />Anyway, the case is great - you should buy it.
B005SZNZAY|4.0|I love this album. It is a good mix of his hits with some commentary thrown in. I would recommend it for any fan of Chris Cornell.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|Watching this movie on fast forward wouldn't speed the action up enough. Very slow paced and no character development. If you are looking for an action movie, this isn't it. This movie had decent ratings on 'Rotten Tomatoes and that's why I watched it. Either I'm having a bad night or I'm just not getting it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I severly enjoyed this game! I played it on my KindleFire and was lost in the bueatiful graphics and encouraging music.  I love the four seasons and the challenges each season brings to a path you thought you had figured out. I won't give any clues because I feel as a fellow investigator the spoilers listed in the journal are seductive enough.  Love it Love it!  Awesome product!
B003L77GH4|5.0|love this series It is on of the best shows i have seen, love the story line, if you like  twilight you will love this series .i am waiting for season 3 . you might like to know that i am 56 years of age it goes to show it appeals to all ages not just the young ones
B006FK7SZ4|1.0|when will this app be available for kindle fire? I tried to download it. I don't understand. Some of the best apps can't be used on kindle fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app...awesome when not using your study Bible. Easy for others to follow along as well. If you still have thoughts then i suggest praying about it.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Love this app so many way to interact with this one, my transom loves it. works well on the kindle fire. Thanks
B004A8ZX28|4.0|Unknown, 2011 film<br /><br />The story begins in an airliner high in the sky. A man writes notes. They arrive in Berlin, snow falls. The man checks his Blackberry. Was a suitcase lost? Can it be recovered? There is an accident and rescue. [Bad luck symbol?] Dr. Martin Harris lives! He can't remember a cell phone number. Four days have passed in a coma. Harris wants to find his wife, but he has lost his passport. He is impatient. \\"Do I know you?\\" says Liz. There is conflict. [A false note?] The police arrive. They check the Internet for his name. Whose picture is that? [Can you trust the Internet?] Harris leaves the hotel, the makes a telephone call to leave a message. Some man follows him, but he catches a subway train. His taxi driver has disappeared, but he finds her. Next he goes to see that German professor and finds his imposter there.<br /><br />The police arrive to sort things out. Harris is back in the hospital for his memory loss. Another medical test. Something goes very wrong! Who is after him? Harris gets away, he goes to see detective Jurgen (a former member of the Stasi) recommended by Nurse Gretchen. Does he know Liz's past? Ask enough questions and a man may change his story. Harris finds Gina the taxi driver, who is an illegal immigrant. Jurgen does his research on the Biotech Congress. But there is another threat! The intruders play for keeps. But Harris and Gina get away. There is a car chase in the streets that ends in an accident. They find refuge in a night club, both are in danger. Harris decodes a book code message. Prince Shahida supports the work of bio-technical research into food production. They watch a building. Harris watches the man watching Liz. Liz explains she is being watched, they are in danger. Mr. Kohl calls Jurgen for a meeting.<br /><br />Jurgen offers a drink to Mr. Kohl and tells about a secret agency that never fails. Harris and Gina recover his suitcase (ownership is proved by knowing the combination lock). Now Harris has his passport. [Foolish to keep it in a suitcase?] Should they wait in a caf&eacute;? That professor meets Harris. Gina sees the kidnapping. Another car chase for action. \\"There is no Martin Harris.\\" It is a legend made up to get into the convention! \\"I'm really, really sorry.\\" \\"Who am I?\\" Gina arrives in time to save Harris (and tidy up the loose ends). There is a big surprise in that suitcase! Harris begins to remember the past. He and Gina go to that hotel. Liz drops a tracking device into a professor's bag. The police are on guard. Can a person use a remote device to copy files?<br /><br />Will the police believe Harris and sound an alarm? Dressler was working on a strain of corn that would grow in any climate. Will things work as planned? Yes and no. There is another fight, only one survives. Will there be a happy ending? Dressler announces his donation of this corn to the whole world. [Stocks in agribusiness drop as a result.] Two people with valid passports leave Berlin. [You wonder what will happen to them next.]<br /><br />This story seems like partly from an Alfred Hitchcock movie and from \\"The Twilight Zone\\". The character of Gina seems derived from that girl with the dragon tattoo. Parts seems incredible. If that secret agency never fails how did Martin survive all those attempts on his life? It is overly complicated for an assassination plot, there are simpler methods (based on the recent news where an Iranian scientist was murdered). This is worth watching once for its interesting story and background.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it 's a good app but it takes too long before you can get certain games it should take less points. Otherwise it is pretty good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Multiple translations available. Fast loading. Excellent search for book, chapter and even verse. Easy navigation. And, true to the Word, this is offered without price. What's not to love!
B0012X6FT4|5.0|The concert on disc 2 and the 8 bonus tracks on disc 1 are quite the deal - could've been a whole album set by themselves.  The concert stuff on disc 2 smokes. What an energy - what you'd expect from a rowdy rock n roll crowd from the late 70s and it's cool to hear a younger Elvis interacting with them and hearing them fuel his performance as well.  He really puts a fire into the performances and all the instruments and everything just has the best of live energy.  Having gotten into Costello's later stuff first (When I was Cruel era), \\"This Year's Model\\" never completely hooked me, but this set is the way to go if you want to explore cause it gives you the studio album first, puts you through some demos and obscure cuts after that (some of which are as good or better than the cuts on the original album), and then when you're wondering how well you enjoyed the album, you throw on disc 2 and you get the whole thing again live into the bargain, and it's a hands down top-notch show that ought to renew your whole respect for the album and the heady year of 1978.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I have this app on my iPhone.  At first it was fun.  All the games are easy.  The first level requires certain points to unlock each game.  As you progress to the next set of games, the points required to unlock each game would increase.  It becomes a really hassle just to keep repeating the games to earn enough points to unlock games.  The games are baby games and the incentives are just not enough to continue with this app.  I deleted this app on my iPhone.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|the game is ok.  pretty interesting for a while, however it got a bit repetitive after a while.  works fine on my nook and touchpad.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I like that it has a hard back and soft cover, but the part that is supposed to be the stand part is pretty flimsy and falls down a lot.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is fun but their are no instructions for the game you pick also the games are instrestiong to plat and nice in color
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Not a single bad note in the movie.  I just love Clive Owen, and he's never been better.  If the opening sequence doesn't hook you, and how Clive uses it to get out of work, then you are a dead person who is dead.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps across the board, no matter what device I'm using. The Kindle Fire app needs a few more formatting options, but works well.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I'm impressed that. I can do moves like castleing and pass and takes. id say this game is alright only tong I have against it are the stupid ads that pop up and distract ya but its free so I shouldn't complain I guess
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I take notes using Evermore on my SOs Kindle Fire. It works really well, and is convieniet (&lt;---speller that wrong lol)
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Very entertaining and yet hypnotizing at the same time. Love your option for device optimization. You don't see that often.
B0040JHLM2|5.0|I just purchased two more pair of the GTS 11's; my 6th and 7th pair. I average about 100 miles a month and, in most cases, can put between 450 - 500 miles on each pair. I typically rotate through 4 pair at a time, when a pair reaches 450-500 miles, I rotate those out and a new pair in. They fit great, they feel great, no aches, no pains. Absolutely love 'um.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i give it five stars because its really fun and the games are easy to understand. its a great way to pass time.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Title says it all. I wish they would update because this is a good program. Used it on other phones and loved it.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Graphics are just dots.. Only kept my attention for less then five minutes if that... I guess I was expecting more then this offered. If I would of shelled out 2 dollars for this, I would certainly cry then demanded a refund. Lol.. Thanks Amazon for another FAOTD. Uninstalling<br />USING / HTC Inspire.
032147404X|5.0|This was a very fast read, but chock full of great advise and tips on digital techniques for a variety of situations.  I have it in my camera bag for reference now and will use it when I'm not sure of a shot.  It's down and dirty, sparing technical explanations for why you should set up a shot in the way he is telling you, but it works.  This would be great for a crash course, which could be followed up by more technical books chosen based on what the reader is interested in.  I also found his humor to be enjoyable.  The one tip I didn't like was to delete any pictures law enforcement tells you to, even if taken from public property.  While it might save you some headaches, I don't think you should delete legally obtained pictures nor should you allow anyone to force you to.  Now, definitely you should cooperate and be friendly with law enforcement officials but if they are being unreasonable then you have to stand up for your rights.  Most times, however, if you are polite and professional when you speak to them they won't hassle you.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|needs to have an app that gives you multiple games in one on the same subject and more prizes please.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this bag for my new camera: [[ASIN:B004V4IWKG Nikon D5100 16.2MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens]].  The bag seems very durable and well-made.  The inside is adjustable to any situation.  Personally, I have an old FujiFilm camera, my new Nikon and two lenses and have plenty of room to spare.  Great value when you consider comparable camera bags selling for $100.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a backpack style camera bag.
B006DICWUE|5.0|With the addition of veteran guitarist Doug Gillard [Guided By Voices, Cobra Verde], NADA SURF have approximated the thicker, more aggressive live sound they have seldom captured on record. Not that there have been problems with any of their records since the 2nd one [the debut, by their own admission, was not quite the band they have become]...but this one absolutely sizzles. The wonderful, bittersweet wordplay {\\"I am lost in my mind when you go to sleep\\"} always manages to capture the exact mood of their heady, melodic pop-rock. This one is most comparable to \\"Let Go\\", but maybe even more upbeat. The only drawback [for me] is the relatively short running time of just over 38 minutes...but, like the adage suggests, they definitely left me wanting more. Hats off to Matthew and the boys.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|because it is so mesmerizing and totally addicting. I'm so glad I downloaded it! I will be recommending to everyone!  I especially love the customization for it. It's easy to change the color and effects. I found it to be one of best apps I've downloaded.  Try it, and have some fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|For years I've tried to get my love of reading back!!  Would start book after book and fall asleep or never make it past the 2nd chapter.  After seeing movie previews for this one, i really was intriqued!!  I bought the kindle edition and dove right in!!  WOW!  Captured me from the first paragraph and I had a hard time putting it down....  took it everywhere reading a little excerpt every chance I got.  I just finished it tonight and immediately started Book 2 Catching Fire and it's started out just as great!!  Thank you Suzanne Collins for getting me back into reading and keeping me there.  Cannot wait to read more of her books but this trilogy completion is #1 on my list!!  Hope the movie is just as great!!! :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love using this app. I love that it has so many translations. I really enjoy being able to choose not only the book you want to read, but the chapter and verse as well. makes it easy to switch back and forth from one translation to another. LOVE this app!!!!!
0439023513|5.0|I just finshed mockingjay and i am truly amazed by how amazing the detail and emotion is put into this book. I find myself immersed in this series, reading for what seems like minutes but was actually hours.Mockingjay is a huge turn from hunger games and catching fire showing a new revolution in the capitol. Being only 14 years old I am truly amazed at the work Suzanne Collins has done with this series. Don't even think about it, buy this book!
1594202842|3.0|1. The book is easy to read. Both parenting models brought to life by Amy Chua are comprehensible and fun to relate to.  2. There are certainly some important issues in Amy Chua's message. However, if you are a conscious parent, you won't be surprised.  3. 'Battle hymn...' is a great place to start a discussion from - enjoy it with your friends!  3 stars for there are better books out there.  Cheers.
B001F0TM5I|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I've been a fan of Q's films since Reservoir Dogs and Death Proof is no exception.  The film itself is very deliberately paced and all the characters belt out \\"cool speak\\" as they always do in Tarantino films.  But as for the Blu-Ray transfer itself...  It's hard to really pick apart the conversion of a film that was intentionally made to look like a 70s exploitation film.  Grainy film, jump cuts and scratches in the film were made to be there.  So how can you judge a Blu-Ray transfer of a film that was made to look old?  It looks just as old as it's supposed to be?  Fine.  As to the extras, there really isn't much new here to see that wasn't on the 2-disc DVD copy.  Although Mary Elizabeth Winstead's A Capella rendition of \\"Baby, it's you\\" is still awesome to watch, only because I crush on her no matter what she's in.  In summation, Great movie but without anything new or vastly improved from the DVD release, it's only getting 4 stars from me.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|In the annals of great \\"smart\\" romantic comedies, \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" ranks among the very best. With James Steward, Cary Grant, and Katherine Hepburn the film is off to as solid a start as any movie could be. It moves along with an interesting and funny story about a divorced couple where the husband doesn't really want his ex to remarry. It does so with smart dialogue and superb acting which impress and grab your interest with classic scenes ... no matter how many times you are likely to view the movie.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart's extended scene with Cary Grant where Stewart's character is tipsy and Grant's is friendly and accommodating is one not to be missed. It's both clever and very funny.<br /><br />The supporting roles are more then ably filled in by performances which take no back seat quality wise to those of the headliners.<br /><br />This is one of those films which is cherished by all true classic movie fans. If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to fill that hole in your experience.
B0063IH60K|5.0|excellent app. it is fun and has easilly accessable options. graphics are great and plenty of card deck faces to choose from. you won't be dissapointed.
B005KELQEU|5.0|It's a great buy, I love it. very reasonable in price, looks very well made.  fits in my purse great.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|I can say a lot of things about this film, but nothing I can say will adequately describe how beautiful and provocative the film is. The directing deserves an Oscar nod, period.  The use of imagery is astounding.  The film is has graphic violence but even the violent scenes are weirdly beautiful.  I could say so very much but I will only say this:  Two films this year deserve special recognition for their use of light and color and those films are Drive and Melancholia, respectively.  The music score and sound for Drive also deserves distinct recognition.  Christina Hendricks of Mad Men has a cameo in this movie and she shows she has serious acting chops underneath that beautiful veneer.  Lastly, Ryan Gosling, you have earned the accolades you are receiving for this movie because this movie would not have been what it is without you, specifically, and I personally believe the torch has been passed to you from a young James Dean or Steve McQueen.  Congratulations to all.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|When I read the reviews about getting lost in watching the app and losing track of time I thought it was a slight exaggeration. But being an adult with ADHD I can vouch for the mesmerisingness off playing with the app. BUT something happened that made it even better! I was listening to Democracy Today on my Kindle Fire and the had a break and they were playing &quot;Radiation&quot; by Kraftwork (sp) and man that really added to the enjoyment of the playing of the app so I highly recommend you check out that song, find something similar (it's electronic type music - dunno what they call that these days :) that you like that fits and go with it. you'll find it brings out the best of the app
B006HAPY26|5.0|Honestly, I loved the book. It has everything I like in a novel, and at times I was jumping around my room pretending to fight drug dealers. BUT, i HATE the price! It was $11.00 when I saw it, and the next day I brought it for $17?! I was so annoyed, but nevertheless I purchased it- because it was one dollar less than dymocks.  I adored it, but seriously- too much money.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Received the CD within the time specified and found it to be in excellent, like new, condition.  It was packaged well, with no tears or other damage.  I am very satisfied with this seller and would order from them again.

B006FTCH2E|1.0|It's bad enough that I took several astronomy classes, I'm willing to overlook the implausible if the movie is still good, such as Sagan's Contact, but this movie was implausible AND dragged on forever.. when it looked like she finally won the golden ticket to Willly Wonka's chocolate factory, Earth 2, the movie ended.  WHAT!?!  I waited thru all that for what?  Why had no one on Amazon written a true review?  SO MEN, BE WARNED.  THIS IS A TOTAL CHICK FLICK.  And I admit I like the occasional well-done such flick, ie, Sleepless in Seattle, Serendipity, You've Got Mail... but this is no Sleepless.  In fact, this movie is the cure for insomnia.  Snooze-ville.  G'luck if you rent it, but you've been warned.
B0000027D5|4.0|`Lotus' was a live concert recording in Japan of the same line-up that made the excellent (but at the time underrated) `Welcome' studio album, billed as `The New Santana Band.' The concerts from which the material was taken were on 3rd & 4th July 1973, and the album was first released in May the following year.<br /><br />The original release was a triple 12-inch vinyl offering with a predominantly black fold-out cover like an enormous work of origami, festooned with colourful religious imagery from Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity to symbolise spiritual union. It was uniquely and extravagantly lavish not just in the history of Santana's prolific releases over the years but for any other music from the era, and has become collectible in itself. Both 3CD and 2CD releases followed with broadly identical (but of course much smaller) replicas of the original album artwork.<br /><br />The most common format available now is the 2CD, though you can still track down 3-disk vinyl originals in prime condition.<br /><br />The music of the `New Santana Band' from this period is predominantly jazz-rock fusion fed by Latin rhythms and complex percussion from Armando Peraza and Jose Chepito Areas, with Michael Shrieve on drums. The sound is predominantly like that on `Caravanserai' and also more keyboard-driven (the excellent duo of Tom Coster and Richard Kermode) than the Woodstock-era Santana. `Lotus' features a couple of numbers from the forthcoming `Welcome' album performed ahead of release, and apart from a powerful performance of `Every Step of the Way' from `Caravanserai' most of the rest of the material is from the band's first three albums. Leon Thomas walks on and off stage to sing a couple of numbers but is on the whole under-employed.<br /><br />The band is tight and bursting with energy, with some real virtuoso playing. It's great to hear the line-up which produced the ambient, jazz-leaning `Welcome' album tearing into Santana classics like `Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen', `Incident at Neshabur' (a real stormer on this album) and `Toussaint L'Overture' with gusto and outdoing anything the earlier incarnation of the band ever delivered onstage, great though they were.<br /><br />Detractors who like to hear Santana play tight and disciplined `songs' sometimes complain about the long extended pieces, too much jamming, Carlos' guitar taking a back seat on some numbers, a long indulgent drum solo from Michael Shrieve (well, this was the 1970s folks) and less-than-perfect sound recording. The only gripe with any merit might be that the drum solo could have been excluded from the final album release, but to be honest the other criticisms don't have much substance. Carlos is in great form (especially on his extended and imaginative delivery of `Samba Pa Ti') though does not personally dominate the music: he allows space for his fellow band members to shine. The sound recording is clear and nicely balanced too, for a live concert from any era let alone the 1970s.<br /><br />Overall `Lotus' is a great album and something of a landmark, but will appeal mostly to fans of the band's more imaginative output during this productive period, when Santana explored jazz fusion and IMO made their best-ever music. It might appeal less to those who like the band only when they play structured five-minute songs, so if this more mellow side of Santana is what floats your boat, then best leave `Lotus' well alone.y Queen', `Incident at Neshabur' (a real stormer on this album) and `Toussaint L'Overture' with gusto and outdoing anything the earlier incarnation of the band ever delivered onstage, great though they were.<br /><br />Detractors who like to hear Santana play tight and disciplined `songs' sometimes complain about the long extended pieces, too much jamming, Carlos' guitar taking a back seat on some numbers, a long indulgent drum solo from Michael Shrieve (well, this was the 1970s folks) and less-than-perfect sound recording.

B003INBNXO|2.0|I'm a bit stunned that folks rate this so highly. I'm not talking about its merits as a set of fight scenes, which are mostly great. But you can't just ignore all the irresponsible crap that surrounds these scenes. I'm talking about the fact that Ip Man is just another in a recent string of shameless big-budget propaganda-like films coming out of China (\\"Hero\\" is another example, though Ip Man is much more blatant and troubling).  Look, normally I would be the last person to overanalyze a kung fu flick, let alone chastise filmmakers for taking on historical atrocities. But this movie sees itself as much more than just a kung fu flick, and that's the problem. I realize that what the Japanese did to the Chinese before/during WWII was horrific. And I also understand that U.S. studios are just as capable of putting out pugilistic propaganda as the Chinese (Rocky IV, anyone?). But there are important differences that make Ip Man truly shameless and worthy of criticism, from its blatant hypocrisy (the autocratic Chinese lecturing the Japanese about being \\"civilized\\" when they massacre their own people in Tiananmen Square and are consistently ranked among the world's top oppressors by numerous human-rights organizations? You've GOT to be kidding me!) to near-delusional historical revisionism (at the end of the movie, the narrator proudly declares that the Chinese forced the Japanese surrender in 1945!) to implicit racism (the movie doesn't just criticize past Japanese imperialism; it also tries to make a case for intrinsic Chinese superiority, then and now). The fact that top-shelf actors and martial artists lent their talents to such an enterprise, and that many reviewers are praising them for doing so, is truly disturbing to me.  So for those of you who love good kung fu, I recommend just looking up the good fight scenes individually on YTube instead of sitting through all the propaganda BS. And for those of you wanting to see a thoughtful examination of the Japanese occupation of China, for the love of god look elsewhere!

0316789798|5.0|I know this book is aimed towards children, but I bought it for myself. I love to draw and paint, but unfortunately for me I'm not very good at the drawing part. This book simplifies the steps of drawing into such a concise manner so you're not left wondering how to get to the next step. Not only are the directions easy to comprehend and follow, but the animals themselves are so quirky and fun.
B006PTL1GC|3.0|Keira Knightley is a hot chick no doubt but she plays her charecter here very poorly. i think you can call it bad acting..... this movie could actually use a good long sex scene....all and all not too boring......the subject of freud and jung deserves more than 140 min of cinema it deserves a mini tv series the least.....

0143034901|4.0|I enjoy lush descriptions of setting and the social milieu of a place and time if there is a page-turning plot; and Carlos Ruiz Zafon gives the reader that.  There is plenty of plot and atmosphere.  There is plenty for a fantasy-buff to like.  The idea is the best place to start for my list of likes: the eponymous book that is a mystery in itself, the love story, the obsession of the writer, Julian Carax.<br /><br />It is an entertaining tale set in Barcelona of a few decades ago, but not the sunny postcard Barcelona.  Rather it is a gothic city of phantoms, haunted houses, love affairs gone wrong, vengeful lovers, improbable twists of fate, ghostly libraries and even more spectral authors.<br /><br />The story is the search of teenaged Daniel, smitten by a book (named \\"Shadow of the Wind\\"), for the story about its author, Julian Carax.  Daniel's father who owns a bookshop took him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books for this rare copy of the book.  Daniel discovers that Carax is the author of several books, which despite having been commercial failures, are being destroyed by a mysterious person.<br /><br />As Daniel also looks for his true love, he finds out about the tortured love life of the mysterious Julian Carax, and his life seems to be running parallel to his hero's, down torturously winding twists and turns.  The background is a character for a horror story: mists, smoke, dark alleys, midnight trysts, blood and dampness.  It is often convoluted and overwrought in its plot rending, emotions and descriptions of places and objects.  Having said that, this is also what I found to be Zafon's voice.  It is part of what makes his style unique, and in many cases, loved.<br /><br />SHADOW OF THE WIND is not a literary book; it is a fable, a fairy story, a story about an author and a book within a book, and enjoyable for all of that.

B004N6369Y|1.0|This book was a total disappointment.  As stated by other reviewers, the character development is so bad.  I actually ended up despising both the two main protagonists.  Both father and daughter turned what could have been  an enjoyable Steele read into an annoyance.  I could not waste my time reading the entire book.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this story so much from page one til the very last word. I quickly began reading book two. I agree with other reviewers that I didn't like the ending of book three but even that didn't take away from my love of this series. The characters are well thought out and enertaining. Suzanne does an amazing job of creating this unique world unlike anything I've ever read before. I read some reviews where they accuse Suzanne of plagerism, and I don't get it. I haven't read this other story their talking about but in todays world of tons of new stories every day its going to be impossible not to have similarities among books. I thought this story was absolutely amazing and you will miss out if you don't read it. That is, of course, if you are a young adult book fan, which I am.<br />This was a world that I wanted more and more of. I really wish she wouldn't have ended the way she did. I think there was certainly potential for one more story.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|What a fun app this is! I agree with others that say it would make a terrific live wallpaper!

Most app developers will read their email much sooner than some review pages so, I'll be contacting them with my suggestions. I recommend those of you with other creative ideas or issues, do the same.<br />  As for you, superman75? Amazon provides unsigned writers/authors specialized tools to present their written stories, novellas, novels or what have you, free of charge. I suggest you use them rather than riding on the backs of all these developers that have worked hard to EARN their place to be either praised or critiqued; you sir, have NOT.<br /> If you want to share or show off your writing talents then, have a little respect &amp; integrity; stop using someone else's platform to do it.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|Watch just one episode of MODERN FAMILY and you will be hooked on the outrageously funny adventures of the Pritchett family. Here is a show with charm and humor. No show since SEINFELD has made me laugh so hard and so joyously.  Ed O'Neill is back on TV as Jay Pritchett, the patriarch of this unusual clan. Sixty-something Jay is married to a much younger and totally gorgeous and saucy Colombian woman named Gloria. Along with Gloria comes her son Manny from a previous marriage. Manny is one of the many stand-outs in this show. Overweight and often awkward, Manny is amazingly self-confident thanks to his \\"don't mess with my son\\" mother.  Jay's son Mitchell and his partner Cam have adopted a Vietnamese baby to complete their family. Mitchell and especially Cam can be over the top in campy gay stereotypic fashion. Don't miss the episode of a terrified Mitchell trying rid the house of a pigeon that has accidentally and harmlessly flown into their house.  Mitchell's sister Claire is equally as high strung and leaning to drama as he is. She's married to the goofy but loveable Phil. Their three children round out the show as three very different characters.  The writing is so crisp and so funny in MODERN FAMILY. The one-liners are hilarious and the show crosses the bounds of political correctness in a way that we know not to take certain comments too seriously. Gloria is a fiery latina with a fiery temper along with a passionate zest for life. It's easy to believe that she actually loves Jay and they do have a happy marriage. Her Spanish accent is forced to almost the point of ridiculousness. Think of Charo for those of a certain age. I don't know if Sofia Vergara has an accent in real life but definitely she's playing up Gloria's way of speaking. Sofia Vergara must be one of the most beautiful woman around and she sure is a treat to watch.  There is an extra treat in MODERN FAMILY. Don't miss Minnie Driver, Shelly Long, Benjamin Bratt, Elizabeth Banks and Edward Norton invarious guest roles. One thing that makes this show so special is that despite all their disagreements and annoyances with each other, in the end this family loves and respects each other. It's over the top at times, not politically correct but MODERN FAMILY is totally delightful.
1466401885|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I bought it in November for my kindle based on the tons of 5 star reviews and the fact that Amazon kept suggesting it to me. It sat on my kindle; unread; until Jan of this year when I was browsing through my purchsed titles looking for something to read. I am so glad I picked this title to read when I did because I kick myself for not picking it up the second I bought it!!! Buy it now and read it now, You won't regret it!!!

B004EPYZT4|5.0|To avoid spoilers, Im going to keep this really short.  I wasnt expecting to actually like this remake, but it was actually really good.  It starts off going in detail on how he became The Barbarian.  But I will tell you this RIGHT NOW. They should make a Conan the early years movie to give Leo Howard, (DisneyXD's Kickin It), more exposure as young Conan.  That would be an awesome role for him to truely break in another genre as the lead actor, since, after all, he did ALL of his own stunts.  Anyway, I'm not saying this is better than the original Conan, It was a great movie for its time.  But, this Conan has what it takes to become the start of a good movie series.  Go rent it.  Once you do, come back here to Amazon and buy it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool books are my favourite... well... ever. I have been reading a looooooong time and no books have gripped me like this before, especially cumulatively bringing me deeper and deeper into the story, into the characters, so much so that it physically hurt to stop reading each night (at 2am or 3am when I knew my kids would be waking in just a mere few hours!).  I read each book individually but I really think having them all together in one will be a great chance for readers to do it all at once, one fell swoop. And I love these books and this author so much I just bought myself a signed copy from his website! I feel like a bit of a groupie, ha ha ha.  You won't regret spending your hard earned dollars on this book. The exploits of the characters within are so vast, so true, and so interesting. The over-all implications of each characters actions.... well. Just amazing. And even after reading all 5 which were extremely satisfying (like a good meal and a glass of wine) I am left knowing that there are still many more tales to tell, and hopefully Mr. Hugh Howey will indulge us all as time goes on. I will be reading everything he writes from here forward. Already have a few of his other books (un-related to the Wool series) ready and waiting on my Kindle.

The base could be wider, to better fill up a standard dock and stand a little stronger.

0143034901|1.0|The book was translated by Elizabeth Graves, the daughter of the great Robert Graves.<br /><br />Translations are most difficult mainly because the metaphor does not move easily from one language to another. Spanish presents special problems because of a cultural bias toward excusing one's actions.<br /><br />We say &quot;It's raining cats and dogs&quot; but the literal translation of the Spanish equivalent would be &quot;It's raining umbrellas.&quot; It is important to understand that there always three levels of translation and it takes a very insightful translator to know which is appropriate word by word, phrase by phrase, etc.<br /><br />We say, &quot;I dropped the pencil&quot; but the literal Spanish equivalent would be &quot;The pencil fell to the floor in relation to me.&quot; This is a reflexive verb endemic to a language where cultural givens absolve people for responsibility of their actions because predestination is the assumption. Some people think of this as baby-talk but it is certainly an unsophisticated view of the universe.<br /><br />We say, &quot;What is your name?&quot; The Spanish equivalent is &quot;How are you called?&quot;; &quot;How old are you?&quot; in Spanish comes out &quot;How many years have you?&quot;<br /><br />Robert Graves was one of the greatest scholars of all time. It is a shame his daughter tackled a job she was not adequate to do.<br /><br />However, there is much more to the main problem with the story than translation though it is difficult to know for sure what would have been a better way to deal with the story other than a really good editor holding the writer's feet to the fire.<br /><br />Simply put, the first person narrator knows things he can't possibly know. This is prevalent in modern/post-modern fiction where both writers and readers falsely assume that a first person narrator who is by nature subjective can tell a story objectively.<br /><br />Robert Graves' narrator of I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD is the greatest sustained first person narrator in all of literature as far as I know. The brilliance of it is its form, an unreliable narrator. We can't believe a word Claudius says and in that the story becomes more than its actions proper, and the perception of that by the reader is what every writer who knows point of view should strive for.<br /><br />Masters of the form are Henry James (TURN OF THE SCREW), Ford Maddox Ford (THE GOOD SOLDIER), Ring Lardner (&quot;Haircut&quot; et al.), Ken Kesey (ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST), Truman Capote (&quot;Jug of Silver&quot;), H. G. Wells (&quot;The Magic Shop&quot;), Poe (&quot;The Black Cat&quot;), and Peter Taylor (&quot;Hand of Emmagene&quot; and anything else of his work), the greatest master of first person narratives of all time. Many other stories could be cited but perhaps the variety of these is sufficient for those who might want to pursue the matter.<br /><br />SHADOW OF THE WIND could have been an enduring work of art.

B0067QPVD2|3.0|This isn't a bad prequel at all. Though I'm still a big fan of the John Carpenter version I will also get this one.<br />My biggest issue, and I think its a MASSIVE issue, is that this movie does not end in a way that syncs it with the Carpenter version. You should be able to watch this prequel first and then pop in the 1985 version as part 2. However the storyline of this 2011 movie doesn't allow the most obvious needed transition between the two. What were they thinking?

B006W0QOF2|1.0|Most people won't read through 18+pages of reviews (and who could blame them) so they won't notice the multiple duplicate reviews from marketing folks who are paid to give movies like this ridiculously positive hyperbolic reviews.  They also vote down any negative reviews so that their many duplicate positive reviews appear earlier in search results.  It's sad that they have to resort to tricks like this to sell a terrible movie, rather than contributing to making a decent movie in the first place.  Ryan Gosling's character says, \\"Do you understand?\\" at least a half dozen times throughout the movie.  It's the only intelligible thing he says.  Ryan Gosling has the worst case of mushmouth of any leading man ever.  Please, friends and family of Ryan Gosling, buy him elocution lessons for his birthday.  Nemo's father, Marlin, still seems pretty distraught after Nemo's adventure.  Thankfully, he's still the same warm, cuddly clownfish we all know and love.  Ron Perlman is in everything these days.  He's like the Samuel L. Jackson of the last few years.  His characters are always angry.  He should have a piece of cake and relax once in a while.  The 80's flavor of the credits and musical score is pretty cool but didn't seem to have anything to do with the movie itself.  Maybe it just needed some Patrick Nagel art or a David Bowie cameo.  I was entertained, but just barely.

1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs is a well-written source about one of the world's greatest entrepreneurs and innovators. Though the man portrayed in this volume is frequently unlikable to the reader who peruses through each page, no one will honestly deny his fascinating drive and genius which helped propel Apple to the status of a high-tech company with a market capitalization that very recently eclipsed the $400 billion mark.  Quite interesting is the level of depth in the research that Mr. Isaacson took on to author this best-selling project. He travelled many miles to various homes, museums and business meetings to explore not only Steve Jobs the successful businessman but Steve Jobs the complex individual. Often highlighted are the notorious temper tantrums and controlling behaviors that would create personal and professional rivalries from the beginning of Apple's days in the garage to Jobs' final days on Earth. From analyzing the character of Mr. Jobs, especially when Apple first went public, and then documenting the recollections and eyewitness accounts of the physical, financial, and emotional havoc it could impose upon those nearest him, Isaacson provides a glimpse of the downside of the corporate world. Regarding what it must have been like for those who assisted Jobs in laying the groundwork and lighting the many sparks that would enable Apple to evolve from a million-dollar to a multi-billion dollar business, the exasperated reader cannot help but say,\\"Wow. A case could be made that, on average, Steve Jobs treated his own friends worse than he did his worst enemies.\\"  According to what Isaacson could gather, interspersed with Jobs' Type A tendencies were the recurring, antisocial patterns that would come to portray the worst of Steve Jobs. Mentioned were the unprofessional job interviews conducted to embarrass job-seeking college graduates, the quick willingness to be ruthlessly critical of others, the LSD trips taken, the questionable hygiene habits, thenegligence of responsible parenting, and the unconscionable act of parking in handicapped spots (sometimes two spaces for one drive-in!). All of these, along with other testaments, caused many to perceive that Steve Jobs believed that he was an exception to the dictates of society. Even though it was purported that Steve Jobs died at a young 56, it is from reading the earlier chapters that one almost considers it a miracle that he even surpassed half that age.  Despite Jobs' interpersonal flaws, it is perhaps ironic that what were Jobs' aforementioned weaknesses in communicating with people, both individually and in small groups, turned out to be strengths in terms of contributing to society.  One might say that what might have marred his reputation in a small, short-term scale ended up contributing to an enduring, if not immortal, legacy in the long run.  Indeed, the perpetual \\"You are a genius!\\" to the \\"You are an idiot!\\" tirades were infectious and under different management would altogether destroy not only morale among employees but businesses as a whole. But what was different about Steve Jobs that separated him from most? Well, from Isaacson's information-gathering regarding Steve Jobs' colleagues and employees, both past and present, it was the main ingredient referred to as Jobs' \\"reality distortion field.\\"  According to Isaacson, there are several occurrences where Jobs made demands upon designers and engineers that seemed to defy physical principles and laws, as well as any other items that constituted reality. After caving in to the potential threats, these same workers would to their amazement meet or surpass what they deemed impossible. More than once was it implied or inferred that Jobs was almost like a magician who could, if necessary, bend facts and truths to fit his vision of the world. Remarkably, many of these same people who dreaded the confrontations with Jobs would conclude that their boss man pushed them to heights beyond what they ever imagined.  Without going into too much further detail, Isaacson portrays Steve Jobs as a man of paradoxes that intertwined to make him reputably the best CEO of at least his generation. His seemingly brutal approach  in the workplace nonetheless enforced the development of high-tech gadgets that we, as consumers, have come to experience. Time and again, his business acumen was supplemented by his iron will to have the operations of his company run by A-level players, as well as making, from both an efficient and artistic standpoint, the best products possible.  Throughout, there are recurring themes that made Steve Jobs' Apple thrive, one of which seems to thumb its nose at typical corporate ideologies. It is this: Apple is about the quality of the product, not the potential profitability. Along with the quality of the product would be a continual issue with Jobs, and it was the enjoyability of the user experience of the products with his name on it. From this latter obsession is the continual if not continuous reminder that Jobs came to live by; it is the simple yet philosophical phrase \\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\\" Quite stark is the passion Steve Jobs had for carrying out his abstract yet sometimes concrete mission of trying to make science and literature meld by making technology meet the liberal arts.  In conclusion, there is so much more that I can add, but I will end by saying that I enthusiastically give Isaacson's work five stars and was quite fascinated by the evolving duality between an open system according to Bill Gates' Microsoft and the like and the closed, integrated, end-to-end system that Jobs wanted Apple to embody.

B00000AFHM|4.0|Released in 1998, THE BOY WITH THE ARAB STRAP was the third album by Scottish group Belle and Sebastian. It mainly continues the twee rock of earlier efforts, centred around Stuart Murdoch's intricate lyrics.<br /><br />Immediately one notices superior production values to anything the band has done before: this album sounds great. The use of bagpipe and electronic loops on the second track and a lush string backdrop on the eighth adds a complexity above the two earlier albums. I would place \\"Sleep the Clock Around\\", \\"Dirty Dream Number 2\\" and the title track among Belle and Sebastian's catchiest songs. \\"Summer Wasting\\" and \\"Simple Things\\" evoke the most intricate of retro pop tunes. Stuart Murdoch's singing is as entertaining as ever. There's some sly dirty humour, an elegy on the difficult of fitting in with one's peers, and never-before-heard introspective moments.<br /><br />As enjoyable as most of the tracks are, THE BOY WITH THE ARAB STRAP is flawed by Murdoch's decision to open up the songwriting process to his bandmates. \\"Seymour Stein\\" and \\"Chickfactor\\" are written and sung by Steve Jackson, and \\"Is It Wicked Not to Care?\\" by Isobel Duncan. I feel the album suffers from their inclusion. They are not necessarily bad songs, and fans of Saturday Looks Good to Me may find Jackson's contributions enjoyable, but they don't jive with the rest of the album, and besides, one listens to Belle and Sebastian for Murdoch's unique storytelling.<br /><br />Still, for listeners exploring Belle and Sebastian's output chronologically (which I'd recommend), this third album has many pleasures and is competitive against its predecessors.

B0073LWEXK|1.0|I think that the game makers should make a game like it or let us be able to get.To play it on are kindle fires so please do it And IF you make it make it like you can not put it down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|when i play this game i love. competing for new games and those so valuable points. this game is very fun
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games can be a bit frustrating and/or tedious after a while, but overall it's a good game. :)
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Sound is very soft and not even loud enough to wake up to on highest volume. Don't waste your time to download.
0743277457|5.0|I like this book for so many reasons.  It is an interesting biography at its surface and he explains his theoretical concepts clearly through examples from his personal life, which make the concepts easier to understand.  At it's heart, it is a systematic and well laid out textbook on the different aspects of learning and mastering a discipline.  Even the most experienced expert can learn from Josh's well organized way of thinking about the subject.  He references relevant research and examples to highlight his ideas, which the reader can look-up as well.  I'm glad to have read the book and hope to use parts of it in my life and my own pursuits.

B0054N73EY|5.0|I'm a huge RHCP fan, particularly of the material with John.  He is, in my opinion, one of the greatest guitarists and songwriters of our time.  His solo work is equally impressive, albeit left of center.  I'd heard bits and pieces of this record before buying it, and still wasn't sold on it.  As I went through it track-by-track after purchase, I had a total change of heart.  The loss of John is still huge, but Klinghoffer takes their sound into a parallel universe (no pun) to John's work with the band.  There is also a lot of fantastic new approaches to songwriting via music theory; I imagine some of that can be credited to Flea's studies at USC.  \\"Brendan's Death Song\\" is one of the greatest, most visceral songs I've heard in a long time.  This album is full of beautiful music in a really fresh way that I hadn't heard from RHCP before.  Definitely buy this album.  Highly recommended.
0312576463|4.0|Here, as always, Franzen's scope and depth are admirable and his characters are for the most part well developed. I'm not sure, then, why I preferred The Corrections, but I must admit that it felt more fully realized to me and kept me in its grip more than this one did. Even so, I give this book four stars because Franzen writes a more full-bodied novel than almost any living American author I can think of. While the Corrections came close, in my estimation, to being the Great American Novel, this one is more what I'd call an Extremely Good American Novel. I do look forward to his next.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|To anyone who has ever been in a band, especially if you have considered it as a career option or have been on the road or in the studio, this is a must-see.  It's very easy to relate to if you've been in that boat.  Obviously, not all of us will ever sell out (let alone play) Wembley, but all of the \\"growing pains\\" and ups and downs that the band members describe, all of the emotions that go along with making music with friends, losing those friends over petty drama, replacing band members with guys you've never met, etc...it's easy for many of us to watch this and say \\"that happened to us, too!\\" throughout this whole doc.  For anyone who hasn't done the band thing, or who isn't even really a Foo Fighters fan, still give this doc a chance.  It's VERY well done, start to finish, and shows the personalities of these musicians you don't see when hearing them on the radio (providing you can find a rock radio station these days...).  Highly recommended.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this really is an app of stars. so wonderfully designed. it is true beauty.  I am in love. with this app. and other things. :)
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I would rather donate to Westboro church then to buy this movie. Honestly don't waste your money. There are better ways to spend your hard earned money.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|This movie truly sucked. I seriously want a refund. Not even worth the time sitting there. One thing is for sure, I'm not watching Happy Feet 3 when it comes out.

B00275EGWY|2.0|Set in modern Baghdad, The Hurt Locker follows the lives of three of the US Army's bomb disposal technicians as they battle insurgent bombers and their own nerves to stay alive in the world's most dangerous war zone.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker was directed by Kathryn Bigelow ([[ASIN:B000H8RW88 Blue Steel]], [[ASIN:B0050BHM1O Point Break]]) and, released in 2008 to much fanfare and critical acclaim, it was nominated for nine Oscars and eventually won six. It's hard, now, to see what the fuss was about. It is a fairly conventional war movie, typical Hollywood fare in fact and I can see nothing about it that lifts above the herd and it is certainly not the equal of, for instance, [[ASIN:B003LVZYL0 Saving Private Ryan]], [[ASIN:B00004CXLA Das Boot]] or [[ASIN:B00004W4I5 Platoon]].<br /><br />Yes, it's well shot and composed, effectively conveying the dusty, sweaty, grimy life of a soldier in Iraq. Indeed, there are some award winning individual shots (the slo-mo explosion sequence where the dust jumps off the roof of a car is particularly tasty) but the ensemble is barely above the ordinary - [[ASIN:B00004W4FX Three Kings]] did it just as well.<br /><br />It's well acted. Jeremy Renner does a fine job as the maverick bomb disposal tech (you may be able to guess where I'm going to go with this), Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty convince as his strung-out support crew and there are some surprising (and brief) cameos from Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and Guy Pearce. But, again, the acting is merely convincing: steely eyes, square jaws, head-in-hands-despair... all that sort of thing.<br /><br />The story, I'm afraid, is what lets the film down. The word \\"maverick\\" really should be banned from use in Hollywood these days ([[ASIN:B00004TT89 Tom Cruise and Tony Scott]] have so much to answer for). It really does a profound disservice to the exeptional bravery and professionalism of bomb disposal technicians of all nationalities to see the lead character yank a cluster of IED's from the ground by their detonating cords, opening the boot of an explosive-laden car by means of a hefty kick or letting off a smoke grenade as he approaches the danger zone \\"to create a diversion\\". There are plenty of other military mess-ups; some of these are clearly excusable cinematographic necessities (soldiers standing around in groups, M113 armoured personnel carriers instead of Bradleys and so-on). However, plenty of others are inexcusably sloppy and betray the absence of a decent (or any) military advisor. I was particularly offended when the three main characters rushed off alone and on foot into the hostile night-time suburbs to track down a bomber... and then split up because \\"we can cover more ground that way\\" for heavens' sake! If the US Army really operate like this (and I cannot convince my self that they do) there is hardly any surprise that the war has lasted so long and achieved so little as it has.<br /><br />In the end, this is a deeply ordinary film and it is prone to many of the usual war movie cliches; tensions between the maverick and his by-the-book colleague ultimately resolved, friendship with with the local street urchin, the race against time, shall I cut the red wire or the blue wire? oh the horror! oh the humanity! think of the children!<br /><br />Without the hype it would have made a fairly decent war movie and I would happily have given it three stars. Because of the hype, my sensibilities are offended and I can only give it two.<br /><br />If you really want to know what it is like to be an EOD officer in Iraq, there are plenty of decent memoirs - [[ASIN:0552155713 Eight Lives Down]] being a decent place to start.ds, opening the boot of an explosive-laden car by means of a hefty kick or letting off a smoke grenade as he approaches the danger zone \\"to create a diversion\\".

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I got two for some reason! Haha, it is very nice but I don't like how the cover doesn't meet the other side. It's protected and fits very well. I like it also because it stands. Reminds me of an iPad smart over.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you will never get bored with this game. it keeps you on your toes. definetely lots of fun and exciting app.perfect for when you want to play easy or hard games.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this app is really great. I would definetely reccomend it...... especially for the amazon kindle fire. I got addicted immediately.
B0029QRA1U|3.0|It's a good record player, but you need to hook it into a receiver to work.  I thought I would be able to just plug it into speakers.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|The over all voice and pace of the book is excellent.  It brought me in and there were only rare times where it did not hold my attention.  I love the way that Rebecca brings us into a whole different way of thinking of the paranormal. So much is set up to add unexpected twists and turns to what we think we are reading. I found myself easily relating to the characters and at the edge of my seat with each turn of events. Ivory's back story made me fall in love with her!<br /><br />My only issue was the romance of the book.  It seemed that it was pushed into the forefront too often causing the epic plot to be shadowed in its wake. I normally don't mind a good love story, but I was so caught up with the main plot that I couldn't care much about the romance.  I also found Charles to be a bit lack luster for his age and plight. I couldn't relate to him and found it hard to want the bond between him and Sophia.<br /><br />I will say that any future books written by Rebecca will surely end up in my library.  I love her writers voice and am intrigued by her plot lines. Its refreshing to find that authors like Rebecca can still come up with new ideas as they play around with the old ones, blessing us with skill and passion.
B001HN6918|5.0|Not quite as good as the first movie, but still very enjoyable, a great movie for young kids that I think most adults will enjoy watching as well. Can't wait for a third one!
B006O5Y09C|5.0|Delightful movie, Woody Allen back in good form.  Whimsical, light hearted, but still has an emotional quality. Definitely worth seeing whether or not you are a Woody Allen fan.
B004LWZW7O|2.0|This movie had a great concept that was squandered by some pretty mediocre performances by Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seybried. I thought Cillian Murphy did a great job with the role he played, but it wasn't enough to make me like this movie when it was all said and done. It's hard for me to even recommend this movie unless you're either A.) A huge Justin Timberlake fan or B.) A huge sci-fi fan. If you're neither of these I would definitely suggest you take a pass on this, but if you do fall into one of these two categories I would make it a rental only.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|I have a question for the continuity people.....I liked the rest of the movie, but was upset to see one thing.....why is \\"Eagle's\\" ascent stage still on the moon when the autobots go to visit the wreckage? I mean, come on, guys....any 60's space buff would have noticed that error....
B004EPYZP8|4.0|Matthew McConaughey did a great job in this movie. Though nothing was really surprising, it did keep me on the edge of my seat until the very end. Anyone who likes these drama/lawyer driven movies should definitely see this at least once, but I'd make it a rental only!
0061969656|2.0|I have read almost everything published which Bernard Cornwell has written.  If I were to review all of those other books, I would likely award an average of 4 stars.  So, it was with disappointment that I finished Death of Kings in what was only a 2 star experience.  Some reviewers have expressed confusion or a lack of direction in this latest book about the years leading up to the forming of England (around 900 AD).  I wasn't confused as much as I was uninterested.  This book felt too much like a hurried \\"bridge\\" in the overall narrative, as if it were filler for Cornwell to get through Alfred's death and onto the next phase of the history.  Perhaps it was.  It felt that way to me because the political environment is explored much less than in his other books in the same series (and others), because the antagonists are each much the same as the other (and none of them terribly interesting), and because the climactic battle scenes have become very formulaic.  The latter is hard to completely avoid as there is history to refer to to find some details of the actual battles, but the overwhelming-odds-overcome-by-last-minute-reinforcements is stale.  What is more, even though the history and even the book relate that these battles were,in fact, critical, the writing to that point was unconvincing.  Unlike most other Cornwell books, there lacked an urgency to the outcome.  Naturally, some of this is \\"knowing how the movie ends\\" through history or through safe assumption, but Cornwell is a wonderful writer and has on most other occasions pulled this off.  I'm hopeful of a much stronger, much more compelling effort in the next installment of the series.  The period he writes about is fascinating and he has written so well in the rest of the Uhtred stories.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Went and saw the live simulcast in a theatre.  It was magical.  The cast was first rate, not a miss on any number.  The surpise guests at the end make this a must have for any Phantom fan.  Can't wait for this to arrive next week.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|It shows to some extent the exhaustion of poverty and disrespect and bleakness. My situation was worse and this has reminded me how strong I am. Set up my own company. But once you been there, that broke you get a fight in you that you only earn from knife egde survival. It,s set me up for life, anything else in comparison is a breeze. Will Smith shows how it moves you to tears and depression, brought it all back for me, fantastic acting. Outstanding, yes you can fight your way back up, because you get gritty killer instinct to make it after all that.

B0067LY4WG|5.0|How do you access the important moments in your life?<br /><br />Not the moments the world sees.<br /><br />I mean the great personal moments, the ones that matter most.<br /><br />I'm certain I'm not alone when I say that music has been a direct pathway to my memory of these moments.<br /><br />Like this: I am not someone who stays up all night, ever, but when my first book was due and I was just 21 and so scared, I sat at the typewriter until dawn, playing Dylan's Blonde on Blonde over and over as I wrote, and then, as the business day started, I walked the manuscript to my publisher with a confidence I wish I felt every day. Ever since, whenever \\"Visions of Johanna\\" shows up....<br /><br />That memory is the exception. Most connected to music are connected also to women. The happy memories have a varied play list: The Four Tops, Otis Redding, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The heavier memories --- almost all of them --- are linked to the songs of Leonard Cohen.<br /><br />If you're in the Cohen Cult, you have a list like mine. As someone has said, \\"You play Leonard after the lovers have left and are in the arms of others.\\" Not always. Sometimes the women were there, and so was a kind of distress you didn't understand and didn't particularly want but couldn't resist --- like a black-and-blue mark you can't help pressing, I used to think. There was something about that pain....<br /><br />The creator of those songs always knew all about that. He picked up the guitar as a kid because he sensed it could help him with girls. It worked --- Cohen is catnip to many of the women in my life. As Cohen now says, \\"It was agreeable to have some kind of a reputation or some kind of list of credentials so you didn't have to start from scratch with every woman you walked into.\\" Look around a Cohen concert and even now, when he says it doesn't matter, you'll see women who look at him as their romantic ideal.<br /><br />Leonard Cohen is now 77. A few years ago, his manager stole most of his money, so he went on a two-year tour, giving long shows that were as close to perfect as anything we're ever likely to see. Everyone who saw Cohen on that tour will hold tight to the image of a thin man in a gray suit, tipping his fedora to his audience in gratitude and humility as he delivered what might euphemistically be called his greatest hits.<br /><br />\\"I remember we were playing in Ireland and the reception was so warm that tears came to my eyes and I thought, 'I can't be seen weeping at this point,' then I turned around and saw the guitar player weeping.\\"<br /><br />When the tour was over, he went into the studio with 10 new songs and recorded a CD ironically titled \\"Old Ideas.\\" That too was bracing --- it's very likely he'll tour again and, perhaps for the last time, we'll see the dapper gent in the gray suit tip his fedora to us in humility and gratitude.<br /><br />I was not exactly looking forward to this CD. His last, \\"Dear Heather,\\" was a weak effort, a marker of decline. Worse than decline; it sounded as if he was borderline addled, incapable of realizing that he really shouldn't be releasing this.<br /><br />So...is this an old man's record? It would be easy to make the case. \\"I've got no future, I know my days are few,\\" he sings. \\"I thought the past would last me, but the darkness got that too.\\" As for thinking about death --- he practices Zen, you'd better believe his extinction has come up for him. \\"I've come to the conclusion, reluctantly, that I am going to die,\\" he told a recent interviewer. \\"So naturally those questions arise and are addressed. But, you know, I like to do it with a beat.\\"<br /><br />And yet \\"Old Ideas\\" is anything but a valedictory. It's taut, vital music, stripped of the electronic gimmicks that sounded so cool a few records ago and got tiresome when they seemed to be covering for weak songs and a weakening voice. You'll hear bits of JJ Cale here, and an echo of \\"Old Black Joe,\\" and, in the background, smart homages to his own work. (For the best example, listen to \\"Darkness.\\")<br /><br />That's the music. The lyrics are something else: considered, bone-deep, precise. And smart in a way that looks like his best work --- a reach for what is eternally true. Here's his method:<br /><br />\\"I don't really like songs with ideas. They tend to become slogans. They tend to be on the right side of things: ecology or vegetarianism or antiwar. All these are wonderful ideas but I like to work on a song until those slogans, as wonderful as they are and as wholesome as the ideas they promote are, dissolve into deeper convictions of the heart. I never set out to write a didactic song. It's just my experience. All I've got to put in a song is my own experience.\\"<br /><br />\\"My own experience\\" is precisely why we put on the headphones, light the candles, make ceremony out of listening. Because Leonard Cohen, for those who love him, is older than time and younger than tomorrow. He insists he has no answers --- \\"Who's to blame in this catastrophe? I never figured that out\\" --- but we know he does something even more important: He asks the right questions.precise.

0142419400|5.0|I have heard from so many people that they loved this book so I went out and bought this one as well as Lola and the Boy Next Door. I am definitely not disappointed!    Anna has her senior year all lined up, until her dad surprises her by sending her to a boarding school in Paris. Now I know what you are thinking it should be perfect right, what girls wouldn't want that..... except she has to quit her job, leave her best friend behind, she may never know what could have happened with her cute co-worker and she doesn't even speak french.    When she arrives in Paris things aren't all that bad. She makes friends with some of the other seniors who instantly pull her into their ground and among them is Etienne St. Clair. He is drop dead gorgeous and is extremely nice to her, but he has a girlfriend. They become fast friends and soon Anna realizes that she may like him more then as a friend....    I like the characters in this story. Anna is just trying to make sense of her life and being in a new environment and overall she has handled things pretty well. The teenagers in her group all have to deal with the things that teenagers have to deal with these days, dealing with sickness in the family, a friend in love with another persons boyfriend/girlfriend, dating, what to do after high school, being there for others when you think your world is caving in.... They all had a hard time along the story but ultimately they had someone to rely on, even if it took a while to figure it all out.    I really liked St. Clair's character. He was overwhelmed with a lot of things and he was constantly trying to be the guy that everyone liked. He was nice to everybody around him but didn't really open up to anyone but his small group of friends. I liked that he wasn't perfect. He made mistakes and admitted that he didn't have all the answers but he did keep trying and he did accept help from the people he loved/trusted.    This is a great book and I can't wait to read more from this author.    To see this and other book reviews, please visit my blog at [...]

0316044695|5.0|I've read a number of eye-witness accounts of modern warfare and its heroes, and this one stands out for two main reasons--the man telling the story, and the fact that it all happened less than seven years ago. In June 2005, Marcus Luttrell (Team Leader, SDV TEam 1, Alfa Platon) is part of a four-man team sent into the wilderness mountains of the Pakistani border to kill or capture a single target: Ben Sharmak, notorious al Qaeda leader. Less than 24 hours later, Marcus is the only SEAL left alive. His fight on the mountain, his refuge with a local tribe, and his rescue by U.S. Army Rangers are laid out here in 450 pages of some of the most gripping, funny, appalling, and heartbreaking words I've ever read.  \\"I will never quit,\\" Marcus says, quoting the philosophy of the U.S. Navy SEALS. \\"If knocked down, I will get back up, every time. I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission. I am never out of the fight.\\" This a story of American soldiers--SEAL or no--who did just that. Read it for Marcus's gutsy honesty; his ironclad faith; his dry (but genuine) sense of humor that could give Patrick McManus a run for his money. Read it for his patriotism; his love for his brothers; his blood, toil, tears, and sweat. Read it for the same reason Marcus Luttrell wrote it--to remember our guys.

145162445X|1.0|This review is from: A Universe from Nothing (Hardcover)  Late in the book the author uses the phrase, \\"a deeper nothing,\\" as a final evocation of the source of creation. This is one of several examples in this book where we might have hoped for greater clarity. Since nothing is the subject of this book, we might expect to find a clear working definition of the word, but none is given. We are then left to surmise that the author makes use of the vacuum or empty space to signify nothing; the book then provides no insight on universal creation. It's recognized that the universe may have evolved from empty space, but this explanation leaves us with the question - \\"From whence came the empty space,\\" or equally \\"From whence the `deeper nothing'?\\"  Much of the author's picture of creation relies on unsubstantiated or speculative science. The first second in the history of the universe cannot be explained by known laws of physics. The inflationary universe agrees with astronomical observations, provided that dark energy and dark matter are included in the equation, and that spontaneous symmetry breaking is a correct theory of particle physics. But inflation in the early universe has astounding features, not the least of which is the existence of an intensely negative force that fuels the inflationary period and fades away in a split second. Also, Quantum Gravity is unknown; the proposed mediator of the gravitational force - the graviton - has never been detected, and gravity may be an entirely different force from the forces described by the Standard Model of particle physics. But the book's greatest weakness lies in its confused use of the word nothing.  Unfortunately, the word nothing has several meanings, but the one we're looking for in the context of creation is the absolute absence of being. It is that nothing that does not exist. Any discussion of a universe created from nothing will have little value if it fails to recognize a more relevant meaning of nothing.
1416550518|5.0|WOW WOW WOW. I wish I could give this book 1,000 stars. It was hands down the best work of contemporary fiction that I have ever read. I couldn't stop reading, but at the same time tried to pace myself because I knew how bereft I would be when I was finished with it. The way the book was written gave me such a good feel for the atmosphere that I felt like I was in another world entirely while I was reading and the characters were so real that I could see the whole thing unfolding right in front of me. I already can't wait to re-read (and re-re-read) this book. Absolutely breathtaking.

B00004XPPC|5.0|This is a story of an intense struggle between the fanatical determination of a Japanese POW camp commandant (Sessue Hayakawa) and its senior ranking English POW officer (Alec Guinness) who is every bit as fanatical.<br /><br />William Holden plays the only American in the camp and manages to escape early in the film.<br /><br />The POW camp is set on the River Kwai (the film is shot in Ceylon) with the mission to construct a railroad bridge within a certain timeline. The commandant is reluctant to shoot or even punish disobedient prisoners because he needs every man to complete construction of the bridge. Alec Guinness understands the commandants situation and gets concessions that undermine the code of this proud Japanese commandant.<br /><br />William Holden manages to return to the sight of the bridge with Jack Hawkins and several satchels of plastic explosive to provide a sad but surprise ending to this great story.
B001F12J0C|1.0|None of the disks will play under Ubuntu Linux on a ThinkPad X200. So disappointed! I'm trying to get a refund.
B003297I1U|5.0|This is one of the most realistic toys that I have ever seen.  It kept my grandson busy for days.  The main problem with this toy is that being so realistic it was to hard for my son to figure out how to use it.  This really stimulates the kids mind.
0765363836|4.0|I started reading this novel because I saw a few episodes of the show on ABC. The story has the same main event, the flashforward, but the storyline is completely different. The story is a little slower than I would have liked at first, but picked up quickly. I truly enjoyed the theories and philosophies presented in this story. I will most definitely be reading more stories by this same author and I look forward to going back to finish the TV show.
B006H3MIV8|2.0|...save your money. I wish I would have. There are a few good covers but most are very forgettable. It would have been better to use classic covers already done by Jimi Hendrix, The Pretenders, Rod Stewart, etc...
B005HSL626|1.0|it crashed after a week now I cant even play frustrating I would give it no stars if I could
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Most of these games are fun and pretty addicting when I have free time. Even my 2 year old nephew loves the games! Points are easy enough to accumulate, so I have all the games now, plus the two that came in the update.  This app is a definite must-have, and even better since it's free! :D
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a good way to keep yourself and your children entertained. my son and I constantly go back and forth setting new high scores in the many sufferer games
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is really cool. You have a variety of games but you only get 10 when you first get it. They only do that to make you earn points so there is a reason for them.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I don't know if this is just a Kindle Fire problem or if the problem is more universal. I have downloaded &amp; installed on numerous occasions only to have the same result. The game freezes &amp; you can do nothing. You can see what you need to click on-it just won't let you click on it or click anywhere else for that matter. Frustrating.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I love this app. the graphics are amazing. it makes you think. so download this app. it has many different modes. so if you don't feel like doin much just choose. the easy mode.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|The stars of this movie are Angelina Jolie's poise and stature and her big smokey-brown eyes and the beautiful Venice locale.  Johnny Depp is no Carey Grant and underplays his role as the titular tourist; this movie doesn't do anything to add to his stardom (and it certainly wouldn't be thrusting him toward stardom if he weren't already a movie star).  Angelina gets the far better role here.  There are a couple of twists of course (one in the middle that I didn't see coming and the one at the end that was pretty easy to see ahead of time--but I won't ruin either of them here).  For me the most interesting character was Paul Bettany's Inspector who was WASPish in his desire to capture the film's \\"villain\\" and whose tone-on frustration in being repeatedly thwarted or overruled at every turn was a delight to watch.
B005POK858|5.0|I haven't been much of an RPG gamer. I prefer puzzles but this one is FUN! I got it when it was Free App of the Day, but looking back, I would have paid for it. More fun than any other game I've downloaded on my Thrive. The graphics are good and the story holds your interest. The best part is that you can have fun playing even AFTER you have beaten the game!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this is a great app! I could spend hours playing with this. I just need to make sure my kids don't see it. :-)
B00136JS12|5.0|How can you go wrong.  This is an epic classic rock album.  This record is perfect for sparking up a huge bon fire; inviting friends over and don't forget the beer.
B006T5FDLG|3.0|First off I have been a Metallica fan since I was about 11, when the black album was new, and Anthrax was the only the only other metal band I knew. In short I prefer the first 4 albums to the second 4 but I'm not hating on Metallica just because they cut thier hair, started playing slower, and quit drinking. In short \\"Load/ReLoad\\" had thier moments, \\"St. Anger\\" was pure garbage and \\"Death Magnetic\\" was a slight return to form and although it was a good quailty release it was no thrashterpiece. So that brings us to the \\"Beyond Magnetic\\" EP. These are 4 songs that were originally written and recorded for DM, but for one reason or another didn't make the final cut and after hearing them I can see why. There is no track on here that can hang with DM in my honest opinion, had they been on DM they only would have brought that album down a bit, the only real exception is \\"Rebel of Babylon\\" it could probably have replaced \\"My Apocolypse\\" which in my opinion actually belonged on \\"St. Anger\\" But now on to the positives, this EP of 4 songs is actually almost 30 minutes long not bad for a mere $5.00, and the songs are a bit fast and heavy, it's just that the songs themselves fall a bit flat and don't really grab me the way some of thier better songs do. And I do prefer this as a seperate release rather than a new re-release of DM with bonus tracks for another $20 after I already own the original verison (alot of bands like to do that). Now my biggest complaint with this and DM is the role of bassist Robert Trujillo, he is probably the most talented musician to ever play in this band, and that says alot when you consider the talents and skills of Dave Mustaine and Cliff Burton. For those of you not familiar with Bobby T.'s pre Metallica works check him out in Sucidal Tendencies and Infectious Grooves he reinvented the prior and commanded the later, for those of you who are failiar with ST and IG know what I'm talking about, I'm not asking for some \\"Funkatallica\\" but give the man the freedom to let his balls hang out every once in a while otherwise his immense talents are being wasted by simply following the guitar notes like some sort of drone, and they might as well let me play bass. In closing this is a worth while purchase for only $5, if you liked DM you wont be dissapointed but don't expect it to blow your mind in any way.
B0063IH60K|5.0|gotta love solitaire! if u do this is a good app for you, works great on kindle I spend plenty of time on it too.
B005KDWUFU|3.0|I bought this dvd because I love Il Divo. It was a disapointment for me.I am not crazy about this one.  To high brow for me.
B000002L6U|5.0|I really wasn't familiar with this particular release and it was only right before Christmas 2011 when I heard several tracks from this album on PANDORA that I was quite smitten with several songs on this album and had to add it to my collection. Phil Collins and Ted Templeman Produced this collection.  Knock on Wood, Forever Man and See What Love can Do are my favorites.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, will watch again. Wouldn't have minded some additional driving scenes but liked his character and style of film. Suprised by the number of negative reviews but can see why some may not have cared for it. Interestingly several people I know who criticize most movies coming out now as either being mindless or explosion based liked this film a lot. Give it a go for yourself
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I really am not a fan of a genre who puts animals in a musical and has flashy colors to entertain kids. I also love JeepersMedia. LONG LIVE MIKE MOZART!
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Chinatown is a throwback noir thriller set in the broad daylight of southern California. The color palette is all primary: bright yellows and sanguinary reds-the opposite of what you'd expect from the typical noir thriller. Polanski sets the tone and the period perfectly. Unlike most noir films of the forties, though, Chinatown has a great script with fantastic characters, a whirling, looping (but always sensible and believable) plot, and one of the best endings of any Hollywood film of any period. Though it need not be said at this point, Nicholson is at his very best, and even the icy Faye Dunaway comes across as sympathetic. John Huston is a show stopper as a sociopathic multimillionaire. So if you like period pictures about big-time corruption, water shortages, and the seedy birth of a big city, rent Chinatown. It's one of the best pictures ever made. Robert Towne penned the keep you guessing script. Just another unparalleled film of the American seventies, a time when they seemed to come off the line as regularly as clockwork.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|What a waste of money. My 5 year old woke me up half way through only to tel me \\"Daddy, make the terrible movie stop.\\" It would have been more entertaining and less traumatic to just throw our money in a fire.
B005TQACLC|2.0|I got this video for my girlfriend who is a diehard Britney Spears fan.  Even though she staunchly defends her idol, even she cannot deny that Britney has lost the flair she once had for her line of work.  She not longer does the complicated dance moves she once did; instead, she continues to favor switching dancing roles with her backup dancers.  Most pop-stars do the most impressive dancing during stage shows and music videos.  The backup dancers accent the dance moves but never outshine the star.  At concerts and even in her videos Britney does little more than walk and provide a minor hip-shake.  Her dancers will sometimes carry her or move her back and forth with some contraption, but the rest of the time they quite literally dance circles around the once shining star.  Oh, and let's not forget that she rarely if ever sings at her concerts.  Fans pay good money to see Britney lip-sync to her CDs.<br /><br />I think most of her fans realize that the work she had done in the past was excessively hard.  She set the bar so high in her early career that even she can't reach it anymore.  No reasonable person would blame her for getting tired.  Heck, I don't even blame her for loosing the flair for the business.  She's taken way more crap than she deserves and she's worked hard to get where she is.  However, if you're a pop star and you don't want to dance anymore, you don't want to sing at your concerts, you don't write 90% of your songs, and you don't play an instrument, then it's time to get out of the business.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|First was good, this one was just meh. not very good at all. bland, not funny and just a money maker.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is an amazing app, well worth the 99 cents they ask for.  It has quickly become one of my favorite games for the Kindle Fire.  The concept certainly isn't foreign (it seems vaguely familiar to me), but that doesn't stop Fallen Tree games from turning this simple construct into a great addition to almost anyone's library.  Beautiful graphics and animation, soothing music and sounds, wonderful gameplay that challenges you while still providing entertainment... what more can you ask for?  Once you advance deeper into the levels, some of them can be quite difficult!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a basic, yet pleasently enjoyable puzzle experience.  Two thumbs way up!
B0063IH60K|5.0|love solitaire!  play it on my kindle fire and iphone. easy to play and love the auto finish.  awesome game. highly recommend.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|The original Happy Feet was mediocre. This cheapquel was atrocious. Plot-less, obnoxious, modernized, any derogatory term you can think of, it probably applies to this \\"film\\". Don't buy, don't rent, don't glance at it on a store shelf, for your own benefit.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hast games ever get it ......................................FUN! just at it it as action shooting any many other games well see you later
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is somewhat tedious but has quite a variety. if you like play the same games fore a while until you've earned enough points, you would enjoy this.
B006QLH7O4|5.0|Can I get an amen? Wow!<br /><br />I really loved the first three movies in this franchise. Even though they recycled the same plot with different actors and kills scenarios, I always found them to be very fun. The fourth, however, really dropped the ball. I may have enjoyed a few scenes, but there was a noticeable drop in quality and I was left bitterly distrustful of the series. That said, I had high hopes for this fifth installment which was directed by new blood director Steven Quale, who has never been at the helm of a movie, but assisted Cameron on Avatar. I purchased my ticket willingly and with optimism.<br /><br />Not only did this movie make up for the Shakespearian tragedy of its immediate predecessor, but I enjoyed completely unexpected levels of quality. For one thing, they got some funny actors (David Koechner of Anchorman, Waiting; P. J. Byrne of BET's The Game, Horrible Bosses) who delivered a degree of inter-kill-scene comedy which the other movies lacked. This comedy did not make the exciting anticipation of the next kill any less intense. In fact, these deaths mixed gasp-inducing red herrings, \\"oh my God\\" shocking moments, and comedic 80's-esque execution with excellent CGI effects.<br /><br />P. J. Byrne really stole the show. To look at him, he's clearly no womanizer. But the things he says to woman after woman over the phone remind us of our self-absorbed frat buddies who couldn't be more rude to the opposite sex. Then there's Koechner, whose lines are as great as his death scene in the opening act.<br /><br />Here's an out-of-left-fielder. I actually enjoyed the 3D. This is the first time EVER that I have seen a movie in 3D without disfavoring it to the standard 2D. My Bloody Valentine was carefully made for 3D enjoyment, but it really seemed second to this. The writing, CGI, kill creativity, tactful cast, humor and production value made for a grippingly funny and overall well-made horror flick. For its high-budget-B-horror genre, the greatness of this movie was almost unwarranted. It reminded me of another movie which truly shocked me with overall quality: Jennifer's Body. Both movies may have been deliberately campy, but both also had the actors, writers, direction and effects reserved for films of much greater magnitude and far displaced from the realm of modern horror. Also, the ending, following suit with the rest of the movie, was delivered with a twist so clever that I'll bet no one sees it coming!<br /><br />If you love horror see this movie.It reminded me of another movie which truly shocked me with overall quality: Jennifer's Body.

0307593312|5.0|A monumental work that I cannot recommend highly enough. It's hard to believe that it is a translated work (by two translators, nonetheless) as the prose flows so seamlessly. Part novel-of-ideas, part fantasy... fully mesmerizing.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I've known about the anti-carb theories on dieting for some time, but didn't really buy into it.  However, this book really explained the theory in a way that helped me understand.  One short phrase in the book was particularily impactful for me:  \\"People aren't getting fat because they eat too much.  They eat too much because they're getting fat.\\"  Until you understand that phrase, you don't understand how carbs make people fat.  Gary Taubes really opened my eyes on why carbs are the culprit in the weight war.

0743233832|5.0|The quality and the quantity of wisdom in this small book if fantastic. Marcus Aurelius didn't set out to write a book for fame or fortune; the entirety of the text he wrote to himself. There's something very compelling about a humble philosophy that attracted minds like those of both this author (one of \\"the five good Emperors\\" of Rome), and a lowly slave (as was Epictetus, another Stoic philosopher) to dedicate their lives to develop the same creed. It's actually easy to understand this fact when experiencing the sheer benevolence, justice, profound consideration for others, desire to better oneself, disdain of vice, strength to boldly weather Fate, and appreciation for rational thinking that overflows from each page of this book. Overall, a work that ought really be regarded much more widely, for which reason I would emphatically recommend it to anyone. If I could I'd give it more 'stars' in my rating.  To me this is the most succinct of the writings from Stoic philosophers that have been passed down to us through time; the topics are varied in thought and yet, to the point. His refreshing perspectives are often enlightening through their simplicity and rationality. The whole thing may even become for some, as it was for me, the stepping stone to delve into further study of Stoicism from the work of other philosophers.  I haven't compared this with other translations, so all I can say is that this one was easy to read, crisp, and engaging.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a cool game, I really like it these games kind of make no sense but still fun. yeaaa buddy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome game a cool way to play in my room and with my friends and chill with my sister
0446547654|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never disappoints.  This was an excellent book with a great story twist.  The Love shared by Dawson and Amanda  is magical.  Life gets in the way and they are separated for twenty years.  They try to move on with their lives Dawson never  forgetting Amanda and she never forgets him.  Until the death of a dear friend brings them together.  I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and I have never been disappointed.  Buy it, it is a flawless read!
B004FOA84A|4.0|Quik fun game in my opinion this game was existing till i got to do the globe, that was the most challenging everything else was a blast. I like this game alot too bad it was not longer. Perhaps add a update with extra mysteries to solve???

B004ZY0VHY|4.0|I don't get the Eva hate. She isn't a cold Mother she has a child with a malevolent, evil spirit and she knows it, but not a soul is listening.  This a gripping story about a child born bad, and the parent who feels responsible for him.  Kevin is a piece of work; sly, calculating, manipulative and defiant. Eva his mother is ambivalent towards him, at first she feels it's a failing on her part and then she slowly comes to realize that there's something wrong/ evil about Kevin.  Frankly, I wanted to reach into the book and slap that stupid, smug, judgmental, non-supporting, enabling Franklin across the face.  So many signs and always ready with the excuses and the judgments. UGH, he is a TERRIBLE husband. The first few chapters are a little hard to get through but once you get past those, you will be hooked!

B005JE7WKI|5.0|I thought this was a great spoof on the \\"evil hillbilly\\" genre of horror films. It was a ton of laughs, although there were a few cringes as well (there were 1 or 2 scenes that were gory, and I don't really like gory scenes). But the movie was just great, as the trailer shows. It's more serious as a horror movie then something like \\"Scary Movie,\\" but isn't a full out \\"Oh God, I need to hide right now! Wait, what are they doing... NOOOO! My brain will never be clean again! What kind of a person could even think that up?\\" horror/slasher flick either. It was great!

0811870413|5.0|I've been baking bread off and on for over 20 years, but I've always shied away from sourdough. Oh I've attempted it before, but my starter never was consistent and it seemed to be too much work to keep it going. However Tartine Bread finally got me going on sourdough breads and now I am hooked. The directions are very detailed yet easy to follow, plus the photos help. One reason why my starter may have worked well this time around is because I nurtured my starter for 3 weeks before attempting to make bread. The starter-making process is also one of the simplest ones to follow, compared to other cookbooks.  Robertson does mention retarding the dough in the refrigerator, but doesn't go into much detail about it. I found that the bread does better with a long final rise in the refrigerator (over 12 hours) and can go directly from the fridge into the oven. I get more oven spring if the dough is cold to begin with, plus it's easier to score the dough.  Other than that missing detail, the book goes to several lengths to explain the process and allowing for adjustments. The book also makes for excellent reading too about the author's bakery and his passion for bread.  For any one wanting to get into sourdough bread-making, this is the book to buy.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|No where near as good as the first movie, such a terrible sequel.  My kids had absolutely no interest in this movie which says alot.

0823004325|1.0|I was VERY disappointed by the print quality of this book and returned it.<br />This is an art instruction book yet the art was so poorly represented that it looked like the book was a photocopy of a photocopy.<br />There was no way to distinguish values or even get a good idea of what the illustrator was trying to express in the drawings.<br />Since my purchase, I have found out that many people have this problem with the book, and that the first printing (hardcover edition) is much better.  I have not seen the first edition and it's only available through used book sellers.<br />So good luck, and as for my review, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AT ALL FOR ANYONE SERIOUSLY STUDYING ART FOR THE REASONS ABOVE.<br /><br />~Laura
B0025KVLTC|5.0|I am a rock musicologist of sorts, and this is the best rock album ever made. No words by me could ever describe how influential this album is. It literally created all cool, inventive rock music. This was 1966. Before psychedelia and all the experimentation. This was the first. Listen to this with awe. Again, the best rock album of all time
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Love this app! cool effects! easy to use! very relaxing. adding colors makes it even more pleasant to watch. the stars just glide with your finger or fingers!

0812992792|3.0|I bought this novel because so many reviewers and readers raved about it. It is certainly a competent novel, and an original one, but I didn't enjoy it much. The central character remains a cipher throughout the long, long events of the novel, and none of the other characters means much. (although some of them are amusing and/or tragic)The mood of the narrative shifts not only between narrative viewpoints but in mood - sometimes the book is funny, sometimes grim, sometimes absurd a la Kafka or Orwell. Possibly because there was no one in the novel I cared about, I felt unanchored in a murky sea of bizarre plotting.  Kudos to the author for spending so much time and effort researching and writing something fresh. Wish I had liked it more.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game challenging but not impossible. this game will keep you entertained for hours. i highly recommend spending the 99 cents to get it.
B001AQMBJG|3.0|It baffles me why go to the effort to transfer these great films to Blu ray format and then include nothing with them.  All this disc has is the film and the theatrical trailer.  Such an important milestone picture should be packed with extras and commentaries.  Not certain what Blu ray edition another reviewer received; I have the stand alone Blu ray version, and it is in 16 x 9 aspect ratio.  However its important to note that like Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick played around with the aspect ratio on this film, varying it with shots and scenes.  I believe the only edition that captures the multiple aspect ratio print correctly is the Criterion version.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|My wife and I bought this album the day it came out after waiting for it after we heard Lana on SNL. We don't understand the critics on that one either. Sure, she looked a little nervous in her first song, but the second had us lining up for the album release! I've also read negative reviews from magazines, etc. I don't get it. Every song on this album is good. It reminds me of songs from the 60s by female singers like Nancy Sinatra, Nico, etc. It's laid back, powerful in an understated way, and just a good listen. Almost every song is great, none are bad, and a few are mediocre. Forget the reviews and give this a try.
0316056863|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Sure, I was a little bored in the beginning--I'm not a reader--it's hard for me to get into a book!, but after making it past the hump, I couldn't put the book down. I enjoyed Tina's sense of humor so much that I think I'm going to start watching 30 Rock (despite Tracy Morgan's annoyingness). Overall, I think this has been my favorite memoir so far from a comedian (beating Chelsea Handler, and definitely Mindy Kaling). Good job, Tina.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|It's been far too long. I had reservations. For the last 30+ years his STUDIO albums were poorly/over produced, destroying even great songs. We had to wait for better live or even covers, to fully appreciate the songs. The Future might be the exception, but still overly produced, which killed many otherwise great songs.  This is a great album. Stunned!
B005FITIGO|1.0|I note that some reviewers share my opinion on this one, so I'll be brief.  What  a waste of talent and time.  It seems that the movie industry is more industry  and revenue than entertainment these days.  Just look at the cast.  Pretty heavy  names, right?  But without a decent script and director, what's left?  I watched  half of it one night and thought perhaps I was just too tired to appreciate it.  The next day nothing improved, in fact it got worse.  To call this slow-paced is  an understatement.  Unless you enjoyed that ridiculous series \\"Twin Peaks\\" where  characters stared at the wall, the wastebasket, their toenails, etc. for long  periods of time without dialog or action, you'll fall asleep here for sure.
0743496736|3.0|Love, Love, Loved the book...until the end.  Such a stupid, disappointing ending.  It was well written and easy to read.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie is the worst thing to happen to me since I was in a near death car accident.  This movie is full of bigotry and racism.  If more adults actually took the time to think about the messages this movie is spreading, then this movie would be banned.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Battle Royale is a must see if your looking for entertainment. Its not really a \\"horror\\" movie but what is happening to those kids is definitetly horrible!! It was a brilliant concept and i've never seen anything like it before. This film is unique and doesnt look like anything we usually see here in america in terms of violence and brutality...this is something else...something new and innnovative.....Many will say that its a very sick concept that is impossible....nobody would do this and ect....But the way it is presented should make us think about what we would do in such circumstances, how would we react? would we play along?....or would we rather die?...<br /><br />\\"At the dawn of the millennium, the nation collapsed. At fifteen percent unemployment, ten million were out of work. 800,000 students boycotted school. The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act, AKA the BR Act...\\"....THE BATTLE ROYAL ACT.\\"<br /><br />The Battle Royale Act would become the ultimate way of getting rid of this violence constantly growing up by letting students who dropped out and young criminals kill each other until only one of them survives and get a chance to live in peace. controlled and restrained by a metal collier around their neck that can explode at any moment, they will have to fight for there lives and kill everyone if they wanna live......its is brutal, violent and it does not forgive.<br /><br />The acting is just perfect and also surprisingly human under the circumstances.Those young actors are all unkown to me but they all did very well. There is nothing cheesy here and those kids really wanna survive, the tone is serious, apocalyptic and screaming for survival!! Cinematography here is also something new i've never seen before...Its not new, not old, but captures the feel of the movie very well. there is a very moderate use of light with very interesting teint of green and blue... especially in the darker scenes at night or in the school.<br /><br />The only downside of course would be the absence of an english version. All we have here is the subtitles,but believe me...after a few minutes in the movie you'll get use to it and wont need anything else!!. I gave up once and decided to watch it without reading but i got convinced to keep reading  because the dialogues in some of the scenes were just awesome! I would also strongly recommend to make sure your DVD player is compatible before buying this film.It is supposed to be region free (0). if your not sure, look for a different version with the appropriate region code for your DVD player.<br /><br />So if you like shocking,disturbing and unusual rides...dont miss this....you really need to watch it...it is worth seing at least once. very beautiful film.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!cenes at night or in the school.<br /><br />The only downside of course would be the absence of an english version.

1455502626|5.0|I think Nelson DeMille is a fantastic writer. In fact, I'm going through withdrawal waiting for his next book, which seem to take longer each new title. While Cathedral and Word of Honor were excellent, Plum Island is the beginning of something special. I think this was the first book for which he wrote a sequel, which is probably because John Corey was such a compelling character. The Corey character, all the way to his latest title \\"The Lion,\\" is still as interesting and irrepressible as ever. I won't get into the story, there are a bunch of them here already. This book is especially well researched, and the detail of their visit to Plum Island made me think I was there with them. A great book, a great series.<br /><br />Let me come back and edit my original comment. I just finished a book titled \\"Hellfire\\" [[ASIN:B0074OD9GC Hellfire]] by another author named DeMille. If you liked \\"Plum Island,\\" you may want to check out \\"Hellfire.\\"
1451627289|5.0|I actually got this book from the library and was not expecting it to be over 800 pages.  As a short loan, I thought for sure I'd have to stop halfway through and re-request it to finish it up later.  I actually got through the whole novel in 8 days, it was that good.  Yes, it's long, but unlike other longer novels I've read, it didn't seem to drag or have unimportant events in it that (had I been his editor) I would've taken out.  King is obviously a skilled writer, having been doing it for about as long as I've been alive, but I was still entranced by his characters and found myself wrapped up in the story.  When Jake runs into problems getting history to change, or running into problem after problem, I was on the edge of my seat.  I was rooting for him to get there and stop Oswald.  History is obdurate- that's the theme throughout the book.  Along the way, you'll meet many different characters who will touch your heart, make you smile, and keep you rooting for the good guys.  And there's even a little love story in there, for those who are closet romantics like myself.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i liked this game a lot. it was very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very challenging.
0345529057|5.0|I love it all.  A little love, hate, war, betrayal, intrigue, cruelty, incest, family honor ... and a host of interesting characters.  I liked \\"Games of Thrones\\" on HBO and reading the book is a double pleasure.  The story continues in \\"Game of Thrones\\" and I am still facinated. Author Martin has an enormous capacity for details and descriptions.  I am taken to a new world.  My kind of story ... A+ in my book!!

B0059XTUVI|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and all I got to say is WOW.  I was in tune from the start all the way to the end.  My emotions were high from the very beginning.  The acting in this movie was WOW. Merl Steep did amazing job.  Weather you agree with her politics or not, it is a movie to go see and be amazed by this woman.  After the watching the movie I had to learn more about her and she is one my heroes.  WOW
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Another sequel cashing in with little attention to plot or character development, opting instead for showy graphics and cutesy appeal.
B005M5OSBK|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing this group talked about on CBS Sunday Morning show.  I am delighted with the music.  When I want something upbeat this is the CD I go for.  The pianist shows his skill especially in his solo pieces, and the vocalist shows her versatility in singing many languages and styles.  Truly eclectic and fun.

B002LW9ITY|5.0|Cars is a classic, and it's worth buying this gift set just for the enclosed die cast Lightning McQueen and Mater. I bought one of these gift sets and my son played with the cars so much, I was worried he'd lose them or damage the paint on them. So I bought another gift set to keep as a collectible. You can't buy this particular Mater anywhere, as far as I know, and it's got a very cool, metallic paint job (and isn't plastic-bodied like the ones in the stores).

0439023521|5.0|I'd been having a hard time finding a book that captured my attention. I'd read a few chapters and then never go back to it. This book had me hooked from page one, I couldn't put it down!! The book is perfectly paced and action-packed. I can't wait to read the second book and so on. Highly recommend!!
0385534639|4.0|The author has created not only a circus, but a game where lives are lost. The timeline bounces around which can be annoying, but you get used to it. Several love stories wrapped in a circus and layered under a deadly game.
006016848X|4.0|In some ways, Men are from Mars ... is a book for couples and relationships. It is a fun book put in a fun concept that help men and women understand their communication styles even better.<br /><br />When I first encountered this many years ago, I found many of the concepts intriguing in working with my husband. I learned that he responded much better when I said \\"Will you\\" instead of \\"Can you.\\" It helped me to be more sensitive to his need to be in control when driving (I don't usually suggest that he get directions, but wait for him to mention a problem), and even more, I have learned to compliment him on the dinner when we eat out.<br /><br />Semi-jokingly, I compliment him on his choice of restaurants, the food, and thank him for choosing such a good one. If something this simple can boost my husband's morale, it is well worth a few strokes to his ego.<br /><br />BUT, as a communicator, the page I have kept constantly marked is the chapter on emotional needs. With a list of highly connotative words, (eg. the word TRUST is at the top of a man's list), I have learned to communicate better with both genders.<br /><br />Probably the only reason I don't give this book a full five stars is that I sense a constant undertone of women and their needs as less than a man's needs. It is subtle, but in this book and the subsequent books he has written, there is this stream that seems to flow. Perhaps it is simply because he is a male and is writing from a masculine perspective, but subtle or not, it is there.<br /><br />Still, an excellent resource, if you keep this bias in mind.

0307341550|3.0|I decided to read \\"Sharp Objects\\" because I loved Flynn's second book, \\"Dark Places\\".  That novel had a stellar combination of great writing and an interesting plot that sped along.<br /><br />The good news about \\"Sharp Objects\\" is that the quality writing is still there.  The author does a great job of describing small details.  You can really picture in your head exactly what she is going for.  She nails down small-town life in rural Missouri, and also is very capable of showing the mindset of popular people and bullies.  I am very impressed by her writing skills.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot didn't live up to the billing.  It's not really a who-done-it mystery, but more of a character drama.  I wouldn't characterize the novel as a page-turner that you will be rushing to finish.  If you are new to the author, I would definitely read \\"Dark Places\\" first, especially if you want more of a suspenseful story.<br /><br />Overall, I would give it closer to 3.5 stars.  I look forward to future books from Flynn.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I really like this game. the best I have found of its kind so far. dont understand the bad reviews.
1400064627|5.0|I randomly picked up this book because I am a huge fan of Dick Van Dyke and I knew Fannie Flagg from his short-lived \\"The New Dick Van Dyke Show\\" and she seemed cool. So I thought, what the heck. I didn't know what it would be about, since I had never seen the movie either.<br /><br />I loved it! I enjoyed reading about Idgie and Ruth's relationship. Being in the 1930s, I was surprised when the mother said something like, \\"now be nice, your sister has a crush.\\" I was like, wait a minute, they are talking about Ruth, aren't they? The mother is being so casual! And later, none of their friends ever acted like there was anything unusual about their relationship. Wishful thinking on the part of Fannie Flagg, I guess, but I sure wish the whole world could be as accepting as the circle of friends portrayed in this book. What a great place the world would be. Even today it is not like that. I picked up the movie after reading the book. I liked it, but was disappointed that Idgie and Ruth came across as being mostly just good friends. And of course, they also served \\"coloreds\\" outside the back door of their cafe which was practically illegal. I really liked the characters and their progressive views.<br /><br />I wonder how Fannie Flagg wrote the book so out of order? Did she write it in order and then mix it up the way she wanted it? I was surprised it was easy to understand the way it was. It also made it a quick and easy read because the chapters were so short.<br /><br />Finally, there was a recipe for fried green tomatoes in the back of the book (and a few others). I really want to try them!

B0067LY4WG|5.0|Carl Sandburg defined poetry as what is seen in that brief moment between the opening and closing of a door. I have listened to Leonard Cohen for much of my adult life and reveled in the mastery and consummate skills shown during the recent tour, especially Live in London. Frankly, I thought that was close to the end of the third act. I knew he cut part of the tour after he injured his back and thought that was the shadow descending. Thus, I was completely unprepared for this recording.<br /><br />A friend told be to rush to hear it. He had listened to it while driving and had to stop by the side of the road: to think, to feel , to cry. I have just listened and simply cannot recall its equal. This is the essential man and the singular human. Everyone will hear the words through a different ear. It has the deepest sadness I have heard spoken to music in the modern era. \\" Crazy has places to hid in\\" and so does genius.<br /><br />One review said all must be right with the world that a 77 year old man could give such a gift of brilliance. This is what words and music were meant to convey. We live close to Montreal and go to the neighborhood that Leonard lives in. I have always imagined seeing him walk down the street and , in some ways, wait for the waters to part. This is a very rare human being and this is a remarkable and touching reminder of what life can give us. If you have lived life at all, this collection of songs will change you.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|I'm a huge fanatic of this franchise. I read Who Goes There, played the xbox game and completely absorbed the 1982 film. Alot of fans will never give this new addition enough credit because it didn't have enough stop motion effects. I remember hearing on the commentary on the older movie's Dvd that John Carpenter actually stepped into the film's effects workshop and had to send this guy to the hospital because he had stayed awake for so many days without quitting on the project. It's a great alien monster to see in action, no matter what form of effects (or form in general) it's in.

My step son actually fell asleep and said it was boring. My niece said It was really cute to watch the penguins but the first one was better. Thank god for popcorn or it would have been a total waste. Take my advice and watch the first movie instead, it was much better.

B005PTYP70|4.0|The Mission Impossible Trilogy,consisting of M-1(Released May/96),M-2(released May 2000) and M-3(released May/06),is now out together in one convenient pack.It is a good bargain for three movies I found to be surprisingly entertaining films.I say \\"surprisingly\\" as I never saw these on their initial releases at the theatre and didn't see them until just a few days ago,when I thought I would finally drop the dime,seeing as how cheap they were.Ahh,the life and times of a poor reviewer!<br />M-1 involves our intro to agent Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) and his team of IMF(Impossible Mission Force)agents.The team gets their mission here from Jim Phelps(Jon Voight)who sends them to Prague to stop the selling of the CIA NOC(Non Offical Cover)list by a diplomat.The mission goes south very quickly and as events unfold it is found that Phelps himself is not who we or Nathan thought he was.The NOC list gets passed from one to another but in the end it is Hunt who must clean it all up and close the loose ends.Cruise does a very credible job in his role as Hunt;serious when need be,detailed oriented to the max and with a sense of humour.Ving Rhames as Hunts assistant Luther,and the only one in all three films,is a definite asset to the cast.Four solid stars.<br />M-2 finds Hunt alerted by a message from an old friend and Russian scientist.By the time he receives it his friend is dead but the essence is is that a deadly virus that was created by him has been stolen and is up for the highest bidder by terrorists.Ethan must track down the terrorists and destroy the deadly virus.The film directed by Johnny Woo is a total bummer/come down compared to the first.Woo has some nice action sequences but his meandering plot,the battle finale'(with cliched roiling waves intercut)and his super sappy ending as Ethan and his girlfriend walk off happily into a crowded carnival setting(more appropriate in Alice in Wonderland!),is a total drop of the franchise ball.He even stole his opening shot of Hunt climbing a cliff face from director/star William Shatner in Star Trek Five!Barely three stars.<br />M-3 finds Ethan teaching now.However he is pulled back into the field when one of his hand picked agents is kidnapped.He rescues her only for her to wind up dead.The man who did the deed is Owen Davian(Phillip Seymour Hoffman)and he is a ruthless and sadistic killer.He wants the \\"rabbit foot\\" and Ethan himself finds himself kidnapped,along with his wife,and has to somehow get free and deliver the \\"foot\\" to the proper authorities.M-3 is JJ Abrams big screen debut as a director and just as he gave a much needed kick in the behind to the Star Trek franchise,so he did with this one and in grand style.There isn't a moment of wasted footage in this film and Hoffman gives a solid performance that even John Malkovich would envy.Four solid stars again.<br />Technically speaking the movies are all in their original a/r's and look clear and crisp.The M-3 disc comes with the least amount of extras,but the other two certainly make up for it.<br />All in all a good franchise and if Tom Cruise and company don't get side tracked,or should I say Woo-ed off course again,there should be a few others come along which should do just as good as M-1 and M-3.Recommended.g a cliff face from director/star William Shatner in Star Trek Five!Barely three stars.

B004AYCWY4|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  Though parts of evolution are open to criticism, the idea of evolution has been proven.  If you don't believe me, then this is the best argument that supports the idea of evolution that I have come across.  I learned much of this information at college, but the reading level is not very difficult and any adult should be able to grasp why people defend the theory of evolution, if they read this book.
B000OVLBEO|3.0|Ghost Rider(released Feb/07) is yet another comic book incarnation of a character brought to the big screen.This one stars Peter Fonda,Nicholas Cage and Sam Elliot,and the results are a mixed bag.The plot and back story can be a little too stop and go for my tastes,while the movie itself only comes to life when the action starts in and the S/FX range free.<br />The movie opens as Sam Elliot narrates the legend of the Ghost Rider.It seems one Carter Slade(Elliot),once a cowboy now doing the Devil's bidding(Fonda),was under orders to retrieve and deliver a contract which contained about 1000 souls.Slade,figuring this was too much power even for the Devil himself,fled with the contract and hid it.Fast forward a hundred or so years and a young 17 year old Johnny Blaze is in a motorcycle show with his dad.However when he finds out his dad is dying of cancer,the Devil steps in to offer a cure for his dad,in exchange for Johnny's soul.Tricked,Johnny inadvertently signs the pact and his father is cured.However the following day just as Johnny is about to elope with his girlfriend his father is killed during his show.The Devil reappears telling Johnny to forget his life as he knows it and that he now owns him,and will return for him when he so wishes.<br />Fast forward once more and Johnny is now an older professional motorcycle thrill rider,doing the most spectacular stunts the world has ever seen.He has a team of workers that travel the country with his show,but he has been alone since his dad's demise and remains a solitary figure.Johnny continues not only to push his limits but looks for a sign that one day may turn his life around for the better.That sign comes one day in the form of the girl he stood up the day his father died.She is now a reporter who asks and gets an interview with the reclusive motorcyclist.<br />From this time on his attitude starts to change but as things would have it the Devil comes a-calling,and he is in need of his property.It seems the Devil's own son is bent on finding the lost soul pact and kicking his father off the evil throne.The Devil recruits Johnny to stop him and enhances his abilities by turning him into a Ghost Rider,replete with jacked up bike and leather accessories,all to go with the flaming skull Johnny sports whenever evil is present.<br />In a lonely cemetery after his first nights ride,he meets the caretaker there.He seems to know more about Johnny and his alter ego than he should.Several nights pass and Johnny encounters the Devil's son and his minions.One by one he slowly takes them out.One day the caretaker reveals that he is THE Carter Slade and he gives Johnny the pact the Devil is searching for.Together they ride to the original town where the souls were collected.Slade leaves Johnny,telling him to keep to the shadows,as he disappears.Johnny indeed confronts the Devil's son,known as Blackheart and after obtaining the pact,unleashes the 1000 souls which pour relentlessly into his body.What might have been an advantage for Blackheart turns out,in the end,to work in Johnny's favour.Johnny had a Pennance Stare with which he neutralized enemies previously.He tried it once on Blackheart previously to no avail,as he did not have a soul.Now filled with 1000 of them Johnny tries it again and it succeeds.<br />Johnny is reunited with his love and the Devil reappears.He tells Johnny that there is no longer any need to keep his powers as he has fulfilled his contract with him.Johnny however decides to keep his powers,telling the Devil that

1428156585|3.0|A brutally honest memoir, and an important introduction to Arabic and Islamic culture any Westerner should be familiar with.  However, this is more about Arabic culture than Islam, so the title \\"Infidel\\" is inappropriate.  Infidel covers much of the same material as her newer book Nomad, which I read first.  I do not agree with all of the Koran.  I am not a Muslim.  However, like Ayaan, I believe Islam should go through a period of modernization, as right now it is anachronistic, as Christianity was before the Enlightenment.  A wise teacher of mine asked me, \\"Why indict an entire nation for the actions of a few individuals?\\" relative to the nation of Islam.  Indicting Christianity for its actions in the Middle and Dark Ages as I have done did me no good, and I don't believe in the same way that indicting Islam will do any good.  After listening to Infidel, which indicts all Muslims, I still do not have an answer to my teacher's question.  However, I do appreciate her call to an Islamic Enlightenment similar to the Western Enlightenment.  I recommend listening to the audio book, Infidel, rather than reading the book, as Ayaan did a very good job with the reading.  This book is rawer than Nomad.  Nomad is more refined in its thinking, but this book was a better introduction Ayaan's history.  I have a great amount of empathy for her philosophical mistakes in this book, as I have honestly made many similar ones.

1594202842|4.0|Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is the brutally honest memoir of a Chinese-American mother, and how the Chinese parenting style, she used to raise her two daughters, is so different, and in her opinion, superior to the way most Western parents raise their children.  In the author's opinion, Western parents were too easy on their children, and too worried about their self-esteem.  The result is often soft-hearted, thin-skinned children instead of tough resilient ones.  Western parents, according to Chua, don't push their children enough to be the very best they can be, and she claims that they also allow their children to make too many of their own decisions.  According to Chua, Western children often select activities that she deems are not in the child's best interest. Examples of these are,  cheer leading, drama club or any other sport or activity that you can't win a medal in.<br /><br />Amy Chua and her husband Jed Rubenfeld, are both Yale Law professors and authors. The couple agreed early on that Amy would decide on the parenting style for their daughters, and as for religion, the girls would be raised Jewish like their father Jed, even though Amy was raised Catholic.<br /><br />High expectations, and respect for authority were a given, and the girls were raised to believe that \\"nothing is fun unless you are good at it\\". To achieve this, one had to work hard and endure long hours of practice, practice and more practice. After school the girls often had to practice up to (4) hours each evening.  Building confident and successful children was all that was important to this mother. When it came to studies, a grade of (A-) was unacceptable. The girls, Sophia, the oldest, and Lulu, the younger child, were never allowed to have play dates, sleep overs, watch television, be in a school play, play computer games, nor could they choose their own extracurricular activities. Friends outside of school were not allowed, as they had to fit them into a busy schedule, often  for a year in advance.  In school, not being #1 was never an option.  The only subjects that were not important to Amy for their daughters was gym and drama -- in Amy's world, if you couldn't win awards it wasn't something worth spending time on.<br /><br />Sophia was always respectful and eager to please her parents, she was tops in her class gifted as a Suzuki piano student.  She was subjected to rigorous lessons, special teachers and the girls even had to practice when the family vacationed.  Amy even chose hotels based on whether a piano would be available for Sophia to practice on.<br /><br />Lulu was also highly intelligent, and a talented violinist, but she was a rebellious child with a mind of her own. She was a girl who often went head to head with her mother with neither willing to back down.<br /><br />I'm not going to elaborate on the parenting methods Amy Chua used on her girls.  You probably wouldn't believe me, and you really should read this book for yourself.  At times while reading this book, I felt a bit like a voyeur, peeking into the windows and looking at the daily life of this family. Honestly, had that been the case, I probably would have called CPS (Child Protective Services) on at least a couple of occasions about this mother.<br /><br />Although her tough Tiger Mom style seemed, in most cases, to produce the results she was hoping for, I wonder what price the girls paid emotionally in their attempts to please their mother, and how she will be remembered by the girls later on.  It always seemed like nothing they did was good enough for their mother, and that they could have done better.  Even though the reader did learn a little about Jed, the girl's father, and the way he was raised as a child, I got the impression that Jed rarely interfered with the demands placed upon the girls by their mother.<br /><br />Do I recommend this book? Absolutely, even though I don't agree with her parenting style,  and I also thought she carried this huge chip on her shoulder.  Perhaps a blend of Chinese and Western parenting styles might be the answer to raising a smart, self-confident and sane child.styles might be the answer to raising a smart, self-confident and sane child.

B004EPZ0AM|1.0|This movie was horrible. It's a typical flop sequel. If you've seen it once then you already know the story. Almost as bad as Alvin and the Chipmunks.
0061992860|5.0|Nice compact version to stow away in your \\"bug-out-bag.\\" Very informative and full of useful information even for the seasoned outdoorsman. Definitely a must have for anyone who enjoys the challenges of the outdoors or just an interesting book to read in general. I could literally turn to almost any page and learn something new and/or useful. I'm not exactly a beginner outdoorsman, but I'm no expert either.Buy this. Highly recommended.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|This review is not at all of the quality of the movie. As we all have our own opinions of what is entertaining. However, i am not extremely excited about the quality of the picture. After about 20 minutes into the first disc, noticed a bit of \\"blurriness\\" that sort of seems worse in some scenes more than others. Sometimes the picture is great, and then seconds later i get a little bit of a \\"sandy\\" looking picture. I can imagine that this could be due to the fact that the film was produced before HDTV and the transfer to blu-ray isn't he same as movies that are made now. The only other thing i can guess, and this is a stretch, is that i noticed on the wrapping of the box set was printed \\"made in Mexico\\". i don't know if there is any significance to that, but the set did come at half the price the local best buy was charging, and I've never seen that on any movie that I'd purchased. Either way, the movie is watchable and otherwise the packaging of the set is pretty cool. I feel as though i got what i paid for. Suppose that i expected to be blown away by The Matrix on blu-ray, but so far it only seems \\"ok\\". My comment about the \\"made in Mexico\\" label is in no way meant as though i care where it was made. It was just a little strange the way it was printed right on the front of the set. Thought maybe there's a chance i didn't get the same exact copy as what is for sale in the stores around here.
185984054X|5.0|Stripping away the myths and spin perpetrated by the Catholic Church and an uncritical press, this book gives an insight into the beliefs and flawed character that was Mother Teresa. Instead of the story of a woman devoting her life to helping the dying poor in India, we hear of a woman who spent much of her time outside of the country raising funds - in some cases from some very dubious characters - and far from using this money to improve care for these desperate people, she continued to let them suffer. Much of the money given to her cause never made it to where those giving it thought it would go, instead being filtered off to fund other church activities. I wonder how those that gave money in the expectation of assisting those in desperate need, felt about their money going to bolster a group of cloistered nuns somewhere in Europe instead? Hitchens writes a great book, to the point and pertinent, in this era of instant fame and apparent almost instant sainthood. A book anyone interest in the truth should read.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie makes Cars 2 look like a grand cinematic achievement. This is the same formulaic sequel garbage that movie studios keep pumping out in order to keep the cash flowing.
B005HP2J66|4.0|An interesting documentary of the oldest cave paintings know - and they are incredibly well done! As this cave is only visited by a few scientists, this doco gives a wonderful view of what would otherwise be a hidden world to the public - and necessarily so given their delicate nature. The paintings are superb and a great job has been done trying to capture them on film, not easy given they don't move, and with only a limted time and ability for film makers to do so. Puts a new persective to the common notion that our early ancestors were simply, bumbling cavemen capable of only a few simple grunts and scratching something equally vague onto a wall. If you have a 3D tv, check out the 3D version - it gives a better feeling of depth to the painting as they are not painted on flat surfaces, and I think gives a better feeling as to what they would have looked like in the flickering lights of those that originally painted them.

B004MPESSY|5.0|This movie is very similar to the last house on the left.  I watch a lot of movies and do not know why I haven't heard of this one I think it was a great movie.

B003PBB4ME|5.0|Of all the U grips out there, this one offers a lot of bang for the buck. Especially nice is the removable flash/accessory shoe on the top.  It is constructed of molded plastic, which is good in that it is lightweight, but it could also be considered \\"too light\\" for some uses that would call for a heavier-duty metal frame. My Nikon D300 fits securely in the opening just fine, but a taller camera body might need one of the taller U grips out there. the Opteka works remarkably smoothly when shooting video with my Sony NEX5.  Overall, I can heartily recommend this grip for both good value and good design.

B001HQZJP2|5.0|When I bought Van Helsing which had the monstrous trio of Dracula, Frankenstein and the Werewolf, I realized the Mummy was missing from the monster squad.  So when I had the opportunity, I bought the Mummy trilogy blu-ray boxset.  I wasn't disappointed as the 3 films provided thrilling entertainment with the highest audio-visual quality.  The 1080p high definition graphics brought out the sharpest and minutest details.  For example, you can see the fine sand particles blowing as the Mummy transforms himself into sand and then disperses at will.  Each film also comes with plenty of extra features, showcasing the movie-making processes, special effects secrets and deleted scenes etc.  All 3 films are encoded with DTS-HD audio which brings the action sequences to life with booming bass.  Amongst the 3 films, my favourite is Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.  Probably because it was the latest in the franchise, the visuals and audio are the most pristine.  This movie also transplants the Mummy mythology into other civilizations (in this case, terracotta warriors) and takes the audience out of Egypt for a refreshing change.  The Yeti monsters were very well done and animated; the avalanche scenes were breathtaking; the Dragon Emperor was probably more fearsome than Imhotep had ever been.  I highly recommend this blu-ray boxset to HD movie buffs.  Although the franchise is very heavy on CGI (not surprising, being Stephen Sommers films), each film offers 2 hours' money worth of entertainment for the action-adventure fan.  Until Universal Pictures makes the 4th film, this boxset offers the best collection of Mummy adventures money can buy,

0553106635|1.0|I've set aside stories in boredom but this is the first one I've set aside in disgust. One scene made me so mad I just pressed the eject button on the audiobook CD. I am done with this.  I picked up this series because HBO's first season had rave reviews. The television show looked good so I figured the books must be good. I was wrong. I hated it within the first few chapters but stuck with it out of curiosity and finally for vengeance. After almost three books I still don't have that and the storyline and storytelling continues to repel me. Vengeance isn't worth the effort anymore.  When I popped the CD out and started listening to music I felt a weight lift. What a depressing, nut kicker of a story.  I've been listening to the audiobook, and all this book has done has stolen 2 months of my drive time.  If you are this far with the series you likely disagree with me but I've better things to do with my time than listen to this tripe.

B005VPRETE|5.0|My 7 year old daughter loves this set. She's always been into Duplos and Legos. She's been building Creator sets before this came out; while she's found this a bit less challenging, and can follow the instructions easily, she still enjoyed the process of building and playing  with the character afterwards.  Some folks have been naysaying Lego's decision to release a range more for girls, but I think it's a brilliant idea. My kids love Legos, but they've never been too keen on the Ninjago and Star Wars sets. It's nice that Lego is equalising the playing field a bit.  Girls have very different interests from boys at this age and Lego's marketing has acknowledge that.
B00000K0DV|4.0|Fulci was in top form for this New York Italian slasher whodunit.  You won't know who the culprit is until almost the end.  Some scenes, especially late in the movie, are hard to watch.  I also enjoyed the grand tour of New York City.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|My only complaints:  1. I wish I didn't know Anne Hathaway stars as Emma in the movie version, because I kept seeing and hearing her in my head while reading.  2. I knew that The Very Dramatic Event was about to happen only sentences into the chapter in which it occurred. I'm not usually the one who sees these things coming, and while I've been envious of others' ability to predict such things in the past, I didn't like it one bit. I found myself speed reading to get to the event because a) I couldn't believe it was actually going to happen, and b) I wanted nothing more than to get it over with as soon as possible. And then I cried.  These two complaints aside, I enjoyed every single moment of this book. Yes, Dex and Em were difficult to like at times, but so is every real person I know.  I bought this on my Kindle and really regret it, because I'd love to lend it out to a number of people.

0062059882|3.0|This book is an enigma to me. I have read thousands of books. In my life I almost never lay down a book and don't finish it. I think I have not finished a book only 3 times and I almost quit this book twice. I loved the beginning and the end. The story grows on you like a bad habit and you can't stop because you want to know what happens.<br /><br />The character Shadow is an interesting and well thought out personality. So are some of the other characters in the book. Unfortunately there are 100's of other characters that are only one line mentions of names that really have no further character development. I wish someone had taken away the author's Thesaurus and his book on ancient religions. The book would have been 125 pages shorter and probably a better story. It is an imaginative story and a good premise for a plot line, it just has too much data in it that is irrelevant to good story telling.<br /><br />The book reads like a European's vacation trip lasting a year going through America. In some cases it is about as monotonous also.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I finished the book and liked it but it was drudgery to read at times. So many names and events mentioned without any character development or real role in the plot except they were on one side or the other or poor humans who were oblivious to the role and life of the gods.<br /><br />I didn't go into the details of the book as there are so many good reviews listed that my review of the story would just be redundant. Is it worth reading once? Yes. Would I read it again? No.
B004EPZ0AC|2.0|Really not worth seeing.  I feel like there are many better ways a company can produce a film but this is simply not one of them.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|It's the winter of 1982 and the Norwegian team in Antarctica picks up a strange signal near their base of operations. They track down the location and the vehicle they are in crashes through the ice into a deep crevice. At the bottom is a flying saucer.<br /><br />Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is hired from Columbia University to look at a secret find in the Antarctic and as a premier Paleontologist she has to see what the find is. She is shocked to find out that the Norwegians have found an extraterrestrial spacecraft and about 300 yards away is an alien body frozen in the glacier's ice. They believe it has been there for over 100,000 years. She coaches the team on how to safely remove the creature from the ice without damaging it.<br /><br />Kate's words when they get back to base says it all, \\"I'll never look at the stars the same again!\\" The creature comes alive and Kate's mission is to now make everyone understand that they cannot let the creature escape and take over the world. Its life form is based on a super virus that replicates whatever animal it touches.<br /><br />What follows is a prequel movie to John Carpenter's classic movie \\"The Thing\\". This movie in my opinion is every bit as good as the original. The acting is well done, the story line is tight and the special effects are every bit as good. The director and script writer keep finding clever ways to creep you out and they work!<br /><br />This movie is well done and is a great prequel and I enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />My only question and this goes for both movies, \\"Why do you need flame throwers in the Antarctic?\\"<br /><br />This is a must see movie if you like Sci-Fi and you liked the original movie!

B0051T47NQ|5.0|Not going to go on and on about this, but I watch a lot of genre films, both big budget and independent, and this was one of the films I enjoyed most in 2011 (which is when I first caught it, not necessarily when it was made). I bought the DVD in order to support the film-makers and reward everyone who has supported this movie in various ways--production and distribution.  The \\"troll\\" effects are wonderful, and the final confrontation between man and troll is worth the price of the DVD all by itself. Although the younger members of the cast are good and often perform well, they cannot hold a candle to the character who gives the film its name. He is the quintessential Scandinavian hero, himself a force of nature - a quiet man, intelligent and practical to a fault, so physically fit and tough that he seems indestructible, with principle and passions that run deep under the surface like dark water under a sheathe of winter ice. The actor that turned in this performance was great and the part is extremely well written.

B0053KWDES|4.0|I was looking for something to open my iPhone 4s up a little.  I use this with the iPhone Line Out and a pair of SE215s.  It is a excellent AMP for daily commuting use and can easily be stashed with your iPhone in your pocket. I will admit I was not expecting much and purchased it only out of curiosity to see if there was some improvement to be had over the iPhone's Cirrus Logic Board.  It turns out there is a difference between the two.  I prefer the sound from the E11.  While both seperate the music into layers well, the E11 seems to provide a touch more warmth to the vocal tones. It also has a good bit of punch in the lower frequencies.  However, the single most important difference that I notice is that the sound stage is much more broad than that of the iPhone.  It opens up separation between your left and right channels and feels more like a stereo in a room than headphones playing in between your ears.  I don't know if I could prove any of this if I had to in a blind A to B test and, thus the rating of four stars.  It does not knock your socks off in comparison to the iPhone's excellent AMP.  But I believe it makes a significant enough difference that I port it around with me on my daily commute. I would recommend a trial to anyone who is interested in seeing the difference.  But as with any of these products you have to give it time before you register your opinion.  I have clocked at least 40 hours of listening with the AMP and have a good feel for it vs. the iPhone's AMP.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|The movie industry and the MPAA think that they repeat this same thing over and over again and then expect you to pay for it over and over.  No thank you movie industry and MPAA.  I will not by buying your junk every again.

B0073TZ1AA|1.0|Like the first reviewer I purchased this app in the hopes of using it on KF books enabled for text to speech(as the product description says).  The first thing I noted was there is no tutorial.  This app is not intuitive at all and I spent much time trying to figure it out.  Ultimately I was unsuccessful.  If there is a way to convert KF book files to files the app can read back to you, I couldn't find it.  After hours of trying I removed the app from my KF and contacted CS for a refund.  Many KF owners have anxiously been awaiting text to speech.  I'm afraid we're going to have to wait a bit longer.  This app is not the solution.  To be fair, the app might work on other things such as reading web pages, but I did not evaluate that capacity as I only wanted it for reading books.

0802473156|5.0|I would recommend this book for every couple out there and also for single people who would like to know how to better connect with others.  If this book is any indication to how much The 5 Love Languages for Children and the one geared toward teens could help, I think many families could be in for some amazing changes and improvements in how they love and care for each other.  If everyone read this book and took the advice to heart, the divorce rate would go down tremendously!
B0067QPVD2|3.0|Well, I was psyched about this movie coming out -I didn't get to see it in theaters but got it on blu-ray and put it in to watch it and... well -hmmm. My love for Carpenter's film is great: it isn't perfect but the tension can be cut with a knife. The all male cast was perfect for what the film required. I was a bit disappointed they had chicks in this flick (girls are great but the tension was gone). As much as the producers and directors said they were fans of the first film, they made mistakes that should not have been made.<br /><br />First, in the '82 movie, when Mac and Doc are visiting the camp, they come up steps to the bloody axe -the '11 movie has a dead end as Kate torches the little hand things on a wall where the steps would be for the '82 visit.<br /><br />Next when Mac finds the ice casing the Thing was frozen in, I don't really see the roof as being demolished, though the '82 film doesn't offer a great view, admittedly.<br /><br />Mac and Copper go outside and find the corpses with kerosene cans around them. The only time I remember seeing kerosene in the '11 movie was when they burned the Thing after it kills Henrick and then when it attacks the doctor trying to get to Kate. They didn't use kerosene to burn the \\"two-head\\" monster -Kate torched it, it jumped thru a wall, then she kept torching it.<br /><br />When Mac and Copper get back to camp, the video of the Norwegian expedition shows them using thermite charges to blow up the ice around the ship or the creature -yet in the '11 movie the ship is still buried until the very end when the engines melt the ice and the Thing was supposedly cut free from the ice, still encased in a block of it.<br /><br />Get the picture here? Though admirable, the producers of the '11 prequel did not pay that close attention. Unless I missed something but these are important things. The dog at the end that runs off looks nothing like the dog in the '82 version -this is a direct connection for the films. (Remember the scene in the rec room, before the Thing gets free and Lars is petting his dog?) -that is supposed to be the \\"Thing\\" dog at the end since the Thing killed the dog after it's escape.<br /><br />Again, Carpenter's film isn't perfect but it's a masterpiece in horror and paranoia -the new film, should have had everyone on the edge of their seats with palatable tension but (except for not knowing what to expect) this movie didn't have the tension. The new film should have set the tone and taken it a step further -real adrenaline rushed paranoia.<br /><br />Another flub is when Kate (barely) escapes the other chick \\"Thing\\" and it attacks the poor doctor -suddenly, outta nowhere Lars comes running up with the flamethrower -? How did he know to bring it? In the '82 film, Childs was told to bring the flamethrower. The '11 movie assumes too much.<br /><br />I respect that they used many practical elements but some of the CGI actually looked like, well, CGI. The scene where Adam is attacked and the Thing is merging its face with his, its seemed to me they didn't finish that CGI very well, watch it a few times. I only rated it as high as I did outta respect for Carpenter's movie.<br /><br />The characters, though well played, looked too clean. The grit and dirt of the '82 film was lost (admittedly there is 29 years separating the two movies) but all the characters didn't look weather beaten or even cold. The girls looked too nice, the guys too sharp and clean. Not enough facial hair, unkempt or ill trimmed. It was too slick. The Thing attacks were too \\"one after the other\\" -no suspense. How did half the people (including the guy on the helicopter and the other chick) become Things? In the '82 movie, you can kind of get a timeline of when most everyone got attacked -not all mind you but most.<br /><br />In the end, if you're a fan of the '82 Carpenter film, stay that way -you may be disappointed in this prequel. I was. Again, I rated it three stars out of respect for what Carpenter did in 1982. He unleashed the Thing.
0307346617|4.0|I am the kind of person who is full of it (BS) when it comes to reading - I read a lot and I read all the time; sometimes even three or four at a time,  I am willing to give most credible books a try - anything from Lady Chatterley's Lover to Harry Potter to Bloodlands. After all theres always a story behind every book.<br /><br />To me, the criteria or at least the most important one, is that it has to have a compelling convincing storyline, then, add some action, maybe a few good metaphors, some heart, maybe even some prose, and I will finish it, but I won't suffer bad writing, emotional prodding or mundane descriptions and I won't bear unintelligent writing for even a paragraph, before moving on to something else.<br /><br />I expected WWZ to have something I won't like, but it was a surprisingly good read. No, not much prose, but a lot of spot-on social commentary of our current world and lots a real people saying real things, how one would imagine these survivors would give their oral history of such an apocalyptic annihilation of our current world. (yes, theres something perversely satisfying in reading how it crumbles into chaos)  Each character is crafted in a way that makes his or her representation, story and voice unique.  The book is well- thought out and leaves few loose ends. I expected the book to slump three quarters way through, as books usually seem to do, but it was hardly a blip on my radar.  Theres lots of story and lots of punch and action that keeps you turning the pages.<br /><br />It won't be for everyone, but somehow, even being a very critical (non horror) reader, it sure was a book I actually bothered to finish and I have quite a lot of good things to say. My original plan was to read it probably not finish it, before the movie is made and now that I have finished it, I'm looking forward to see how the multi million dollar visual results match my U$9 print outs....
B0036EH3XE|5.0|As a huge fan of the series, this was the final piece of the puzzle... amazing price, fast shipping. Thanks!!
0756404738|5.0|This book is wonderful. I agree with some of the negative reviews here, that the plot doesn't go anywhere and nothing of substance about the world is revealed. But that doesn't matter because the writing is just so amazing, how can someone spend two paragraphs describing silence and make it seem interesting? I would never have believed it possible until I read this book.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great item to protect my Kindle Fire.  Nice looking and gives great protection to my Kindle.  It was shipped with my Kindle Fire and was easy to install and is very attractive looking on the unit.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|This set is easily one of the best tribute albums I've ever heard.  Every time I listen to it, I marvel at the overall high quality.  The genius of Dylan's songwriting is not shown simply by the sheer number of artists who contributed to this album.  It's also reflected in the fact that so many musical genres are represented here:  rock, pop, folk, country, blues, soul, jazz, and even a beautiful instrumental by the Kronos Quartet.  Is it perfect?  No, there are a few missteps, but it's amazing that there are so many excellent performances on such a large set with so many diverse artists.  Let's get the bad songs out of the way:  4th Time Around - Not one of my favorite Dylan songs, and Oren Lavie's version is even more dull than the original.  Desolation Row - My Chemical Romance did a horrible cover of this song for the Watchmen soundtrack, and their live version here is just as bad.  The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll - This song is full of sorrow, but Cage the Elephant's performance couldn't be more flat and lifeless.  Absolutely disgraceful.  Forever Young - Pete Seeger talks, rather than sings, his way through this song.  A complete waste of time.  I'd Have You Anytime - Evan Rachel Wood performs it like a bad lounge act.  She should stick to acting.  With God On Our Side - K'naan leaves out some of the verses, changes some of the words, and adds a bunch of his own words between the verses.  The result is that he demonstrates very clearly that his lyrics are nowhere near being comparable to Dylan's, and the power of the song is vastly diluted by the radically changed words.  This is easily the worst song on the album.  Now for the best stuff.  Blind Willie McTell - Tom Morello gives a powerful performance with his gritty vocals and killer guitar.  You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go - Much to my surprise, Miley Cyrus does an excellent job.  Turns out she's a damn good singer.  Who knew?  Ring Them Bells - It's a truly beautiful song, and Natasha Bedingfield's gorgeous voice makes for a memorable cover.  Make You Feel My Love - Well, of course Adele nails it.  Duh.  The Times They Are A-Changin' - Flogging Molly rocks the hell out of this.  Don't Think Twice, It's All Right - I'm sure this is the most polarizing song on the album, but I think it's incredible.  Ke$ha sounds absolutely wrecked, as if she just watched a family member die before recording the song.  In the original version, Dylan is trying to play it off as if the end of a relationship is no big deal.  The genius of Ke$ha's version is that she's saying that it's no big deal, but she's clearly destroyed by the situation.  It's incredibly powerful.  There are many other memorable songs on this album.  Even without the six bad performances and Dylan's original \\"Chimes of Freedom\\", that leaves more than sixty songs which range from good to excellent.  It's for a good cause, and you can't beat the price.  So why haven't you bought it yet?
B0068RHSCW|5.0|I watched the movie expecting another cliche horror one but I am happy to say that it was something different and better, although the main plot is kind of predictable, I gotta admit that it was a very touching movie with very good acting that gets you to care bout the characters. conclusion: a very, very good thriller that most people wont regret watching, but not a horror movie,if I were to describe it Id say that this is kind of a love story filled with some paranormal stuff and superb acting that will keep you interested and caring for the characters
0142410349|4.0|From Brandon:  I give this book four stars because they describe Mr. Fox very well and everyone else too. Plus Mr. Fox is very funny. Boggis, Bunce and Bean are three very mean farmers who want to make Mr. Fox's  life terrible and want to kill him even though they know they can't. Mr. Fox makes the farmers very miserable.  I hope you like this book as much as I do.  From Kayla:  I give this book a five out of five becase this was really nice, funny, and fun book.  At the end Boggis, Bunce, and Bean end up staying up there in the rain for their life just to get Mr. and Mrs. Fox and their family!
1881273156|5.0|This book is not just theoretical, or case study material, but practical and useful information on showing and receiving love, as given and received by people. The author explains and then gives advice on how you can show love so your mate will feel loved. Great book !
B0054JZC6E|4.0|all the games make you wanna keep playing! I can not put my kindle down! I love this game and I hope they come out with more.
B0019DCDOS|5.0|4 discs of pure awesomeness. I love special features. I love LOTR. Mesh the two together and you get one happy fan!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I am impressed that this app works so well.  I've saved the wifi address it provides in my Favorites, and this will make it simple to access my data from my PC whenever my Fire is on.  I've viewed the .jpg images stored on my Fire, and I'm watching an .mp4 video that is on my Fire full screen on my PC.  The playback is flawless.  This app is a lot more convenient than hooking the Fire up through a USB cable to the PC and getting the two devices to communicate.  This app is well worth the money.
B000GIXLO8|5.0|I am a LOTR nerd and wanted the theatrical release. For some reason I did not realize it at the time that it also had extended edition on it as well. It works for me! More LOTR!
B006FE17Q6|5.0|i frankly did not think it could be done: a zombie show which could have me so glued to the screen that i watched seven straight episodes all in one day. and i've been thinking about those episodes ever since.  they were that haunting, especially this episode, number seven.<br /><br /> i have to be very careful what i say here so i don't ruin the plot and suspense for anyone else.<br /><br /> there are a number of stories going on among the characters but the two principal ones are: can they find sofia, who was lost during one of the zombie raids.  and, two, can they stay on this wonderful farm where they relocated after carl was shot.  its owner, a retired veterinarian, saved carl.  this is how they ended up on this farm. it never dawned on me that the writers would dovetail the farm and the hunt for sofia but they do so seamlessly.  it is so poignant how the two are brought together that it has haunted me since seeing this episode.  AMC has done it again by bringing its third smash hit to tv.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0060AY6FO|2.0|Love PD James and murder mystery novels.  Also loved Pride and Prejudice.  I like the idea of this book, but it was pretty painful to slog through.  The plot line was even ok but there was no sleuth, no investigation, etc.  'Something' (I wont give away story details) happened, the police interviewed people about what they saw, then those same witness testimonies were repeated to the master, to the master's friends, to the courtroom, etc. The we find out who really did it, but it was sort of a red herring up to that point.  Bleh.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I really did not like this movie. This movie was not my favorite. I dont know what the deal was but the comedy was tasteless and the humor was bland.
B0036T31YY|5.0|Time travel itself dates back long before H.G. Wells had penned his first science fiction novel the brilliant \\"The Time Machine\\" but \\"time loops\\" are a more recent sub-genre of time travel made popular by \\"Ground Hog Day\\". GHD has even become a term in Quantum Mechanics and was mentioned in \\"Triangle\\". The basic theme of time loops is that the hero/heroes relive the same period of time over and over in hopes to make changes which might make a better future. Jess, the heroine of the story, is reliving an ocean voyage and is the only one of her friends who realizes they are caught in a time loop. The greatest problem with time loop stories is the they create faults which cancel out the logic of the story such as the famous Grandfather Paradox where a person kills his own grandfather making it impossible for him to have existed and travel back in time to kill his own grandfather. As one person pointed out the looped car accident could not have happened over and over or else there would have been a pile of broken cars and bodies, the accumulation shown by the pile of dead sea gulls. However, anomalies do occur in the story, for example, in one loop Jess never interacts with the new group while in another loop she holds a shotgun on her other self. The traffic accident could have been one of these anomalies and not part of the loop. I defend the movies because I really loved it and consider it one of the better, perhaps the best, in this new genre.

B004Z4LVZK|3.0|The book was a good price.  It was shipped quickly.  The problem is that after sending back the first book I got due to what I thought was a drop of blood on the bottom of the pages, I received a replacement with the same mark.  It must be a marker.  Why the company selling them would do this is a mystery.  My daughter, who is a perfectionist, is highly disappointed.  She never would have bought this nowing it wouldn't be in pristine condition.  Be prepared for an imperfect copy to arrive.
B0001Z53F6|5.0|Tommy sounds great in Dolby 5.1. This DVD brings a 43 year old album to life once more! Tommy is one on the great albums from the 60s. Pete Townshend wrote all but two of the the songs on this original rock opera. Some noteworthy songs are: Amazing Journey/Sparks, Pinball Wizard, I'm Free and We're Not gonna Take It/See Me Feel Me. This DVD is a must have for a 'The Who' fan or anyone who likes music in 5.1 surround.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so so much! It's wonderful! Very amazing. It's so funny and feels so very real. They are both so good in it. Their chemistry is so natural! It's funny!!! I love the moment where she's drunk and gets into a cab and tells the driver to take her to Adam's house. And the driver is like, \\"Where's that?\\" to which she replies, \\"it's where Adam lives!\\"  Oh, it's so silly wonderful. And wonderful scene at the end when they are eating breakfast and he tells her that she eats like a baby dinosaur without chewing!!! I laughed a lot during this movie. Very nice movie. It kinda reminded me of another movie with Ashton and Amanda Peet....what's it called....they also had such a good chemistry....\\"A Lot Like Love\\".
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I bought this Blu-Ray for my girlfriend. This movie is one in a series of movies made by a church (so a lot of the actors are the same): Fireproof, Flywheel and Facing the Giants. This movie is very interesting and has a life changing message, to boot. It's cool to see the quality of their movies get better with each new release. I would recommend this movie to anyone with sound moral values. This one is definitely family friendly and enjoyable. Summarry: So if you enjoy good wholesome fun, this one's for you!
B0000060NH|5.0|i had been looking for this album,i was so glad to get it.i love that it,s mostly music.the one sung that i love has words. just what i wanted.if i want something i can,t find  amazon is the place!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having my Bible on my kindle. I can read it anytime I want to. Even if you don't have wifi at the time, you can download it to your device, so you can use it at all times. When I go to bed (which is my quiet time), I do my daily devotional on my kindle and take notes and everything. I can even highlight. I share a room with my sister, so while she's trying to sleep, I can do my devotionals on my kindle without disturbing her. This Bible app has really helped me stay closer with God because I can do my devotions anywhere, so that helps me stay on track with the Lord.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|No Human being should ever watch this movie. Absolutely do not buy, rent, watch or even think about this movie.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I couldn't resist writing a review for one of my favorite books of all time!  I admit the language is a little hard to get used to at first, but once you get in a rhythm, it's fabulous.  The romance is classic and probably forms the basis for a lot of the modern romances today.  The hate you / love you interaction between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy is captivating.  This is one of the few books I love to read over and over.
B002XTBE8I|5.0|I just cant get enough of Em! Always something to say, never a dull moment! There's another one for the book's!!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This app reminds me of being at a gift shop in a mall and playing around with one of the really neat light things that I never bought because they cost way too much but were fun to play with.  So now I own one and it only cost a few bucks (I actually purchased on free app day).  Get yours now.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible plans. Very easy to use. I don't have to take different versions of the Bible now. Also taking notes is so easy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It does exactly what advertises to do. Fast and easy to use. Wish it had more graphics available.  Highly recommended.
0385534639|5.0|Lots of books refer to magic (in the deep, not stage-illusionist, sense) or include events that are powered by magic, but very few give a feeling of what magic really is--in a sense, are magic themselves. This book is one of them. Even the cover is right; its colors are minimal from most angles, but seen in the right angle and light, the decorative swirls around the title take on an iridescent glow.  The book concerns a man and a woman, raised from childhood by their fathers/mentors to be rivals in a magical contest (for the glory of the older men's egos), who instead fall in love when they finally meet. Marco and Celia are worth knowing, as are the older magicians, the members of the Night Circus, and the circus's biggest fan, Herr Thiessen. The real star of the book, however, is the circus itself. Created to be the venue for the magical contest, it instead becomes the venue for Marco and Celia's courtship and, ultimately, their chief reason for existence. It is truly, as its alternate title says, the Circus of Dreams. The author draws readers into the circus from the beginning, making us feel we are actually inside the striped tents, and describes the wonderful acts in considerable detail. Her use of the present tense throughout adds to the feeling of immediacy.  This is the best fantasy book I have read in a very long time, and several not-easily-impressed friends I have shared it with say the same thing. I can't wait to see what this author will do next.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|Yes, she's got it all: The voice, a major deal, clever managers, unique style. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ARE:  She's got A VOICE and she writes her OWN SONGS.  There is a lot of fuss about Lizzy being a product-fake, so what?  Like most of us I haven't met Lizzy so I can only speculate about what is \\"REAL or FAKE\\".  One thing that stikes me is that there is so many people hating and blaming her; \\"She sold out her realness for the big time, her daddy is f****g rich and bought her studio time, she's got fake lips, she can't sing, she is just a beautiful face, she'd be nothing without the internet..\\" etc...  But then: Watch her performances on Jooles or SNL and what do you see?  A nervous girl, a human being singing songs about human matters in a very delicate way.  A perfect prey for all haters of the universe. (Scary to face so many of them).  Why blaming her for having a supportive father?  If there'd be a documentary about a iconic rock star whose dad saved his little earnings just to let him record a demo all eyes would be wet.  And there'd be nothing wrong about it, it's great if people are willing to give something away that proves they love someone or do at least have faith in the talent.  Yes, and paying 200 Dollars for a weekend at a half-baked demo studio for someone on working man's wages is of course a bigger donation than a millionare paying 20.000 Dollars to let his daughter make a record.  But even Bob's money couldn't buy her talent or THAT VOICE.  The lucky man didn't even have to try...  As you might believe me there are lots of \\"Stars\\" out there I find annoying but you won't hear me saying a thing about them... Why?  Cause they don't deserve my attention and time.  So, people writing Lizzy down are probably dissatisfied, jealous and envious.  Whatever you like to see in her you have to understand that, despite all reservations, she's got a huge talent and a wonderful voice.  I don't think that Lana Del Ray is fake, it's part of her (Lizzy's) identity.  Of course it's JUST ONE PART, but nothing that isn't inside her; traces of that already can be found on her first record (2010).  I think of her as a chameleon like Bowie is (And yes, people hated him when he sang about the laughing gnome. It was an awful record, but no one could deny his unique voice even back then, remember?).  Success should provide complete artstic control for her.  I wouldn't be surprised if her next album will be different in style and I'm sure she'll deliever HER \\"Hounds of love\\" in a future not too distant.  When I listen to \\"Born to die\\" I get the most pleasure out of her fantastic voice and the way she changes colour and timbre within a sentence.  I get the impression that Lizzy is sneaking through the curtains of her doomed \\"Hollywood sadcore\\"  and says: -Look, it's me, I'm still Lizzy, but it scares me to go outside and to be hated for that so I made up this girl that is tough and cool... She's called Lana.  The tragic thing about her is that she has no real self-esteem and acts the way she does not to be hurt and to impress these bad guys she fancies. You know; she's a bit like me..  She's in trouble but it seems like she already got used to it, calling it her fate.-  Why am I writing things like that?  1. I'm amazed to see that someone with talent recieves fame and attention!  +  2. All the ones calling her unprofessonal and uneducated in terms of live performance will be the first to mmoan \\"She's lost her innocence, she's just going through the motions now, she's a fake, we want the real thing back...\\" once she'll deliever more consistent stage acts.  I don't know who she is and I'm not collecting any pics of her.  I just love what I hear.  \\"Born to die\\" doesn't re-invent popmusic.  But Lizzy has got a little secret a lot of people have already recongnized: She's very good.  4 stars only and just because I know she will deliever more brilliant stuff, possibly something we can't imagine by now.  If I didn't have these high hopes for her I'd gladly give 5 stars because this is one of the best \\"Major releases\\" of the last 20 years.  Well done. Lizzy!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This has got to be the best movie I have seen in a long time.  A lot of people thought that this was going to be a straight up action film or a fast and the furious ripoff.  Its not this is a rare movie that takes a lot of risks and succeeds for the most part.  The atmosphere in this film is so great that its almost overwhelming it really feels like a 1980s movie due to its great soundtrack and overall feel of the film .  The soundtrack is amazing and one of the best I heard put into a movie.  Anyone who has seen taxi driver with robert de niro will see the resemblance of these two film. Highly recommended!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|There is so much better out there. Save your money and find something worth the money. I rely on these types of reviews on amazon. Believe me, you can do much better with other animated films!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this should be a wallpaper its beautiful I think every one should have this app for all reasons even just for fun to play around with.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I love the plan selections. I love the choice of having it audible. I can plug in my earbuds and sit back and listen. Awesome.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This ap is a great way to learn &amp; study the Bible.  I love the devotionals!  The only problem I have is I don't know how to save my notes.  Other then that, it's an amazing tool.
0061992623|5.0|This book is a must read if you are worried about were the world is heading to. It reassures you that things are getting better. We are expecting too much out of too little.
B0073PZIYI|5.0|This movie will make you think about your time and what you are doing with it.<br /><br />It's set in a post apocalyptic era. There are only two types of people: the haves & the have-nots.<br /><br />The have-nots work to earn time - time to extend their life beyond 25 years. The streets stay empty because they don't have a second to waste. When they buy necessities, they are charged time (ie: 2 hours off your life time clock for a bus ride home from work). A young man is falsely accused of stealing a rich man's time. The young man escapes to the rich side of town where he falls for a rich girl who has never experienced a \\"poor\\" lifestyle or the have-nots' side of town.<br /><br />The storyline follows them as they try to navigate out of this mess that they've gotten into. The girl ends up joining him in his efforts to rob the rich banks and distribute the wealth (time) to the have-nots, so they no longer have to live day-to-day in fear of running out of time (death). Lots of action, car chases, suspense, & more!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app works great on my kindle fire. I didn't have any problems with it working, I would definitely recommend it.
0756655730|5.0|Although it is a big picture book it contains enough information to be readable, too. We have a copy in our adult household and gave a copy to a young family. Their eight-year-old has been reading it and informing everyone about the largest animals on earth.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's solitaire. It's hard to mess that up. But I do love it. play it more than I should lol
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I read 116 books in 2011 and this was definitely my favorite.<br /><br />In the future, the US is an environmental wasteland and everyone spends most of their lives in OASIS, a virtual world created by James Halliday.  When Halliday passes away, he leaves OASIS and his considerable fortune to whomever can find an Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in OASIS.  Halliday grew up in the 80s and was obsessed with 80s culture.  His passing creates a group of egg hunters called, \\"gunters,\\" who dedicate their time to becoming students of the 80s in hopes of finding a clue that will lead them to the egg.<br /><br />Wade Watts is a poor kid living in the \\"stacks\\" which are vertical towers of trailers.  He is also a gunter.  Through a series of events, Wade is the first person to find the first key in the hunt for the egg.  The story follows him and several other hacker-like teens in their race for the clues.<br /><br />I loved the story.  It was a completely unique premise and not really comparable to anything else I've read recently.  Having said that, it did feel like I was reading a movie, so I'm not surprised that the movie rights have already been sold.<br /><br />Also, I was born in 1971 (Halliday was born in 1972) so I'm exactly the right age to appreciate all the 80s video game and pop-culture references.  I was a little bit of a geek which definitely helps!  The book really is 80s nostalgia-porn.<br /><br />I loved the characters of Wade and Aech and the scene where the two finally meet in \\"real\\" life was one of my favorites of the entire book.  The scene definitely made me feel a little emotional which is when I realized that I was actually truly invested in the characters in the book.<br /><br />I've already recommended this book to mulitple people and can say that anyone who enjoyed Infocom games, D&D, Atari and John Hughes movies will like this book.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|My wife and I saw this movie in the theater. While the movie was only 102 minutes long, it seemed more like 102 hours. When the movie ended I was so angry that I didn't just want my money back, I wanted revenge. I'm only sorry that I have to give this movie a star. This movie doesn't deserve a whole star. 1/2 star would be generous.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This application does just about everything I could want. Especially the trackpad mode. Love it! And I totally recommend it.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Difficult to impossible to navigate between settings menus without restarting. Otherwise a beautiful display of physics. Runs well on the Kindle Fire and HTC Evo.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|great app. only free app I have ever reviewed and its worth 5 stars. would have paid 1.99 for it if I knew it existed before today.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Serves its purpose. Decent games. Four stars, definitely not five. Im only making this review to get the ingame points.
B0031OCY2E|5.0|There's something I love about this movie. I think it's Matt Damon's fun and authentic portrayal as the lead role combined with they way Steven Soderbergh builds up and unravels the story. It also sheds light on the American food industry (which I followed up with the documentary film King Corn). Watch them both as a pair!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|well... i bought it from Android Market... cuz it's just release 1st before Amazon....  this game is must have buy... it's is long game and exciting!!  solving and puzzle is really exciting me!!  now i have 4th heart gem so far...  you will love this game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Totally great book. I got the first book for free with amazon prime. I read it in 1 day because I just couldn't put it down. This book really isn't just for young adults I am a father and absolutely thought this book was great. When i finished this book first thing the next morning I bought the second book. In the end I read the trilogy in just 3 days because I really could not bring myself to put it down. It is a little gory at times for younger readers, and some other content like the twisted people in the Capitol is a little offensive to some people. Overall it was a great book and I loved that Collins kept to the story in the 3rd book and didn't ruin the series by making it some sappy teen love story.  I can't wait to see if the movie(s) can come close to the books.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This was given as a gift. My friend loved it. We listen every day. He had the original albums, but they were stolen many years ago. Nice replacement.
0446573019|4.0|Good read.  This book had a great story line, and strong plot development that packed a lot of suspense.  Unfortunately, with such a great build up, the ending was a bit of a letdown.  It went a little too technical in the thriller moments.  Fun read though, with good characters and good intrigue.
0439023521|5.0|This was such a great book, I finished it in 2 days... I can't wait to start on the next book!
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I love the app but I wish u could save the images to ur device cause u can make a lot of kool things on it
B004MC8CA2|4.0|very easy to use and reliable app.  it would be great if maps and illustrations and references links were available.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|I received this item faster than expected. Watching this show in blue-ray is amazing can't wait to finish the season and buy season 2 on blue-ray.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Whoever believes in romance will enjoy these movies. As a marketing executive for Summit I was pleased to see the turnout. I have to say I really hate going to the theater to see any movie and this one made me smile, because I was involved heavily in marketing. When you enjoy seeing people smile and talk about it afterwards postively it was a great thing to see.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|this movie...really, really, really, really, really do sucks.........and MPAA sucks too, but, all the staff that made the movie is great !!!...LOLzz
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I luv this game this game is like it has a whole punch of ga es this game is free so try it out it gets complicated on the sushi level
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a great app for the fire. its a great time killer and works seamlessly!  I'm glad I found it.
B006T5FDLG|2.0|I've been a fan since i was about 13 in 1988, staring with Justice. Then when back and got into the early material. The Black Album was pretty good, just different, but there again i still liked it. Load and Reload were basically crap with a few good creative innovative songs and ideas here and there, but nothing stellar. My attention started to wane when Hetfield lost his voice. I couldn't stand his voice cracking like a 13 year old hitting puberty. Since 1999 i have cringed anytime they attempt to release something, which isn't saying much after only having 2 pathetic albums in the last 10 years. Magnetic had very few moments, maybe one on \\"My Apocalypse\\", and on \\"All Nightmare Long\\", but it still all sounded forced and like they were just trying way to hard to be their old selves. And that's my issue here. Jame's voice just ruins any chance of these songs being good, from his winy, chorus on Hate Train, \\"YOu ToOk AWay TOmoRRoW\\" which is awful to the Hell And Back, Masters Of Cheese track, all together it just stinks. The fact is i'm not bitter, i'm just SICK of Metallica. How they can do no wrong, and they money hoard, when they should have retired and been happy years ago with what they had. These little unreleased tracks are just another money making scheme for the boys to rip off their fans. There is a reason these songs didn't make it on the final cut. Even though the final cut wasn't that great. Go away Metallica, you've milked this industry and worn out your old school fans for FAR to long. Enough is enough. I won't even touch anything new they come out with, even if it is \\"great\\". Just because i'm sick of them, period. So lets move on, shall we. (Note if bands didn't sell out with a huge identity crisis like Metallican't, i wouldn't be so harsh). Slayer, Megadeth and Antrhax are doing it as well. But aren't nearly as annoying. Well, maybe Megadeth. :) So waste your money if you want. I want nothing more to do with this band.
1451629184|5.0|This was an amazing story of Jaycee Dugard.  Her story, though incredibly sad and heart wrenching, I really enjoyed reading her story.  She seems to be a very amazing person who sees the positive in life and is also an amazing mother.  I am glad that I bought and read this book.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|When I read all the reviews I thought the app must be over-rated; it's just moving around some dots. This app is mesmerizing and I'm only holding back a star because there is no record or snapshot functionality. It's still worth the price if you didn't grab it while it was FAOTD.
B005H29GSI|4.0|The product is good, My son is 5 years old, and he spend a lot of fun time to play with this toy.  My complain is about the box of the product when I received it the box was damage, but actually the product was OK inside.  In general the product is good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best, most comprehensive Bible app I have ever seen.  Lots of translations to choose and audio to boot.  Highly recommend this to all Christians.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I wanted a stand I could use to lift my Macbook Pro 17\\" off my table and give me space underneath for my external drives and some peripherals.  My macbook pro sits perfectly on the stand.  The top bars sit from the front of the laptop to almost the very back of the laptop.  I moved the laptop around, shifted it, and pushed it back and forth to make sure everything felt stable enough.  My laptop feels stable and the stand feels very stable with it.  I have no complaint about the stand and find it to be exactly what I wanted and a great price as well.
B000002JSH|5.0|Bad Company<br />Straight Shooter<br /><br />Three of the tracks on this one CD are Rock classics, and the rest of the album is excellent as well.  This is the second of five straight great albums from the group.  \\"Straight Shooter\\" earns Five Stars.
0061726826|5.0|I read Before I Fall last year and it was actually my favorite book of 2010. I knew I had to read this second book by Lauren, without a doubt. I was floored when I won the copy.<br />I knew that it was nothing like Before I Fall, but I had no idea what to really expect.<br />Can you believe it took me places I have never been with books. I saw all the scenery, like it was right in front of me, and I felt the emotions from the characters so deeply, that I cried at the end.<br />It was fascinating, exciting, interesting, emotional, and powerful. Another one of my favorite books now.<br />Thanks Lauren for being so immensely creative and filling our minds with wonderful stories.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Beautiful &amp; relaxing.  A wonderful way to calm &amp; clear your mind. Not to mention, an entertaining way to pass a little time. The colors are great and the patterns endless. If you liked Strange Rain, you should enjoy this.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|On average, I watch about 600 movies a year. Sometimes it's more and sometimes it is less, but I will only watch a small percentage of them more than once. The truth is, very few of the 600 are altogether memorable. Some are praiseworthy but I feel no emotional connection to them, while others are indulgent but less than adequate upon later examination. Then there are the perfect films. The ones which not only have the ability to keep you thinking for days, but also grab you in a way which almost feels personal. In 2011, for me, this film was Drive. A culmination of a director I have long respected, an actor I very much admire, and a promising premise taken from a book by James Sallis resulted in the best film of the year. 1 in 600.    for full review go to [...]
B006E4QCXU|5.0|We down loaded Gravilux we played with it for about hour,  It is like a little stress releaver. we will be playing this app again
B006E4QCXU|4.0|i like how pretty it looks even on my midlevel phone. it runs smoothly and even though i got it for free it's totally worth a two dollar purchase. will recomend to friends.
B0041G67VU|5.0|This film is a story about a dormant volcano that threatens a small town called Dante's Peak in the northern Cascade Mountains of the United States. The film appears to be loosely based on the actual eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980. The setting and mountain scenery are magnificent. Dante's Peak was released just before another disaster film called Volcano but Dante's Peak is superior to Volcano in every way. The cast in Dante's Peak is very appealing, especially the lovely Linda Hamilton as the mayor of Dante's Peak. However, the ladies will probably find the suave Pierce Brosnan more appealing in the role of expert vulcanologist and life saver. The special effects are awesome, and the dangers faced by Pierce Brosnan, Linda Hamilton, and her very attractive children are produced with frightening realism. The awful movie cliches that abound in that other disaster film Volcano are absent from Dante's Peak. I would describe Dante's Peak as a very superior disaster film with a cast that you can really like and with whom you can empathise in their dangers.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I just installed this on a Samsung Infuse 4G and it does not load at all.  It shows it is compatable but it is not.  Do not purchase this if you have upgraded to gingerbread.  You will be wasting your money.  Thanks Amazon for stealing $3 from me.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this is what some people only dream about. I've wondered when this was going to happen. fine job with this app.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|\\"For 12 years, I was held captive by the humans. The world I once knew has changed. Vampires and Lycans are now the hunted.\\" The war between vampires and lycans has been interrupted by humans. The humans who found the existence of the two have waged a war to exterminate all of the \\"changed\\". When Selene (Beckinsale) is captured she is surprised when she wakes up 12 years after the wars. When she is free she begins her hunt for Michael...and revenge. I have to say that I have liked the first two (the prequel one was lame) but this one by far had the most action. A very fast moving movie that had a little different story then the others, which is why I think it moved so fast. It's been a while since I watched the others but I don't remember them being as exciting as this one. This is a rare sequel that is not only as good or better then the others, but also one that can stand on it's own. Overall, a really fun and exciting movie to watch. I give it a B.
B006ZDS7CE|2.0|I heard her perform on the David Letterman show last night.  She's beautiful, with a good voice.  I tried to like her music, but I just didn't.  The melody didn't go anywhere (I don't know what song she sang... I switched off befofe the song ended).  Not my cup of tea, but listen to some samples and decide for yourself.
B006QVRVJK|4.0|\\"Both sides share the blame?! Are you serious?!\\" After their kids are involved in a fight at school both groups of parents decide the best way to resolve it is to talk it out. What starts off as a civil conversation quickly escalates and becomes a shouting match with name calling, personal attacks and alcohol. I have to start by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. It is just the four actors in an apartment talking. That said I do recommend this movie. The acting is fantastic (with 3 of 4 Oscar winners) and the movie is not slow moving at all. Both intelligent and funny, which seems hard to do these days the movie keeps you interested the entire time and waiting to see what happens next. There really isn't much more to say about a movie like this one, but if you liked \\"Sunset Limited\\" you will like this one too. Overall, a very good and funny movie that is not for everyone. I give it a B+.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible Application is above and beyond the best one out there. It has a wide variety of Bible versions, plans, reminders etc Awesome

B002KSPKRS|4.0|The x41 are a must buy and they are so awesome to use for everything to your system well can't honestly say all systems because I haven't tried any where else but my Xbox so far. This product was delivered to me on time and in great condition as if I went to best buy which in Total would cost you about another $30-$40 more. Now the set-up was easy and I didn't even read the manual or look at the pictures but if you are having trouble then I suggest that you do. the 7.1 Surrround sound is on point and clear but it has a major flaw when playing games because you will have to connect the your X41 to your controller which would time to time do the famous Snap, Crakle, and Pop ( Ahh so delicious ) and if it happens just simply make sure your mike is all the way in the port and have the the cord facing down usually works for me for some reason.  I'm not going to go in deep detail about this product but I will update later if I approach another problem till then, Good Hunting peeps.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|Well, I have to say that the main thought that went through my head as I read this book by Jamie McGuire was that the main character, Abby, was in some need of some serious counseling. Some SERIOUS counseling. She was an absolute mess. I can't say that I hated her as a main character. She was good enough, but she had some issues that really needed to be addressed, and sadly, those issues never were dealt with at all -- not by her, not by her supposed best friend, America, and not by the supposed love of her life, Travis. So, I'm going to have to step in here and do what NO ONE in this book was willing to do -- speak the truth. Here goes:<br /><br />Dear Abby,<br /><br />You have a problem. You are an alcoholic. You use alcohol to dull the pain whenever life doesn't seem to be going your way. You have no issues with getting completely wasted at any social gathering you attend. You aren't even of legal age. You are nineteen and a freshman in college, but you have no problem using your fake id to give you instant access to alcohol at what seems like every single moment of this novel.<br /><br />But that's not all. You are addicted to gambling as well. You may say that you are trying to start a new life away from the gambling addict issues of your father, but it seems as if you are placing bets at every corner. For goodness sakes, the entire premise of this novel begins with a ridiculous bet you make with Travis! Instead of dealing with the gambling addiction your father suffers from as well, you feed his very problem by agreeing to solve his latest gambling pickle of a situation by GAMBLING to get him out of his troubles. How hypocritical of you to run away from Travis for hinting at a desire to get involved in this life to earn money when you are constantly finding yourself making similar choices.<br /><br />You obviously have some serious issues that stem from your difficult childhood with an alcoholic mother and a gambling father who blames you for his terrible streak of bad luck. That is understandable that you would need to work through those issues. So work through them. Get some counseling -- beyond this letter, obviously. Your constant changes in your relationship with Travis have some deep seeded reasons for them. Instead of having such a tumultuous relationship it might have been helpful for you to get through your own issues before dealing with Travis's.<br /><br />And as for that relationship, well . . . I don't even know where to begin. I have to admit that I was rooting for the two of you to find your happily ever after. But then I would scold myself because what you have, sister, is a borderline abusive, and definitely codependent relationship. It isn't healthy for you to be attached to a man who is so insanely obsessed with you. He flies into depressed rages whenever you try to break things off. He goes out and gets two huge tattoos without thinking twice about it. He has his own violent tendencies that really need to be addressed in counseling (but I'll spare adding a letter to him to this review). He beats men to a pulp constantly if they so much as look at you too closely or make a stupid comment of innuendo. How did none of these guys end up in the hospital or dead? And how did Travis not end up in jail? Anyway, the truth is that you should be much more wary about getting into a relationship with a man such as this. At least give it a bit more time before you make any long term commitments. All abusive people are able to be fun and charming some of the time. It takes time to see if they truly have changed. And even if you can put aside his tendency to smash other people's faces in, shouldn't you be a little more cautious about pushing so quickly into a relationship with a man who has never kept a relationship longer than a night. He keeps a revolving door of women coming through his apartment. So he says he's changed for you. Maybe. But I would think you'd want to give him more than a semester to prove it to you.<br /><br />And, Abby, dear Abby, hasn't anyone ever told you that you should never, ever make huge life altering decisions right in the midst of a traumatic event? I'm sure that the ending was meant to seem romantic, but I couldn't help but think that it was a crazy decision for you to have made on impulse. I understand your new recognition of your feelings for Travis, but really, sweetie, you should give yourself some time to process things before you head out on a jet plane to change your life forever. Too quick of a decision.<br /><br />So overall I have to say that it was easy to read your story and root for your relationship to succeed, but you were just making too many mistakes for me to feel good while I was reading. I would never, ever use your life or decisions as an example for what I would want for my daughters, or my friends, or anyone really. You need to grow up a few years, work through your issues in your past. Help Travis work through his own issues of his past. And then maybe, maybe you will have a story that will be an inspiring one for us to read.<br /><br />For now . . . listen to yourself when you say: \\"This is wrong. This is wrong on so many levels.\\" Amen. You aren't kidding.<br /><br />With love, your fake therapist and story reviewer --Mel<br /><br />And that is all I can say about this book.you that you should never, ever make huge life altering decisions right in the midst of a traumatic event?

0525478817|5.0|This is one of my favorite books that I have read recently, and I go to book camp (I'm that nerdy). To misquote John, it made me feel \\"MOST OF THE THINGS!\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best game I have on my tablet I love it;D If you don't have it you need to get it it's so much fun;D
B006IGZX0C|3.0|It was disappointing to pay rental on a movie with no closed caption.  The movie itself was quite good, but for people who need CC, it was unhandy having to back up and replay.
B005HSL626|2.0|This is a fun game to play but now all of a sudden I can not even open it! What gives?!?
B004O3YGMC|5.0|so good so far! it does everything that it said it would! the setup was easy once I read the directions!
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I love this!!! but the thing I wish this app had, was that it had different patterns.its still epic and amazing
B003L77GG0|5.0|I love it!!! It was the best. It tied up many of the story lines. I hated to see this series come to an end but man what a ride. It was great.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|i wanted to try this out just to have a mobile Bible, but I didn't expect to like this as much as I do. The different versions are easy to change between and the Bible study plans are fun and easy to keep up with.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Unlike the video, the Acer tablet won't show any menu. kind of boring just black and white, would be nice if you could bring up settings or menu to change colors. interesting bit has been out for a few years now
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is very easy to use and helps keep me organized. I use it on my Kindle, my work computer and my home computer. I even downloaded it on my son's computer so that he can share things with me. I'm thrilled I finally found a way to share info (primarily links and notes) among my computers!
B006E4QCXU|3.0|runs very well on my sidekick 4g.  beautiful app that's gorgeous to look at and manipulate for a few minutes, but then the charm wore off for me.  should add more patterns and make it a live wallpaper to add more functionality
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Don't buy this movie.  The MPAA is a bunch of thugs trying to control all media worldwide.  Downvote all MPAA movies as much as possible.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some are hard to play and move around but other than that the games are fun. if your bored id reccomend this ap to play many games.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This cover fits perfectly, is light weight, and I love the color. The only drawback is that the inside of the cover attracts dog hair from my 3 dogs.
1419702238|5.0|Good book only down side that is short but still a very good book!!!Hopefully there is a new secquel and good read!!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game was my first purchase of this type and I loved it. It went fast for me but, in the maker's defense, I played for hours straight. Just bought Grisly Manor and am looking forward to it.
1419702963|5.0|My daugher has just started reading this series. She likes the fact that the children go to church, is funny, and she likes the comic-type illustrations. She draws her stories in comic form too. She also recommends Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Dog Days and the Do-it-Yourself book.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|At last!  Here we finally have the perfect cast of actors.  In most versions of Jane Eyre, Rochester is too handsome, Jane is beautiful, and Bertha, the mad wife, is a hideous hag, dressed in rags.  In this version, Rochester has a rugged countenance, Jane is mildly pretty, and Bertha, while totally insane, is still beautiful, and well dressed. After all, being insane does not make one ugly.  As to the story line, while we see the misery of Jane's childhood, and her wandering upon the moor, these events are not the major foci of the story, as they were in the 2010 BBC version. The present version also allows for the full development of the attraction between Rochester and Jane.  Masterpiece Theatre is to be congratulated, for a job very well done.
B004EPZ0AC|2.0|It could be that im only 14 but this was stupid... Its a bunch of mainsteam music with dancing penguins. Its ghetto, its cheesey and they try and take the \\"cute fluffy penguin\\" thing too far. It was like haha! penguins dancing! for the first few minutes but after that i just got bored of it. it was meh...
B006E4QCXU|5.0|it is cool but like others have said, would be a great live wallpaper. it is still really neat though
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I read the reviews before reading and the negative ones mostly described Travis as violent and beating everyone up, but I didn't see that at all. In reality he only punched 1 or 2 (aside from is his fight club) people and in my opinion they deserved it. He is a lost man who doesn't think he deserved to be loved by a women. I enjoyed this book and think they made a good couple although I did feel a little bad for Parker but I liked the way the story ended.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Loved the movie and the ease of purchasing through Amazon.  Everything was as described and the Blu-ray arrived quickly and undamaged.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I've played this game before on iPhone and its extremely fun and very addicting. Disappointing however that I downloaded it on my galaxy nexus and it freezes every time I play it. 5 stars after its fixed
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I could play with it for hours. so happy I decided to get it, and even better that it was free. id say everyone should get this app.
0896898288|5.0|The patterns are easy to use. The fun part is making a block each day, small committment of time but such variety and at the end of the book you have enough different blocks for a good sized quilt. The bonus are the letters, really puts into perspective the good values and work ethic of American woman who lived and worked on farms. Highly recommend. Doing the blocks in bright modern cotton prints.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I know, it's only pop-and-roll, but I like it, I like it. I'd heard \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" about a hundred times on my local NPR station, and didn't pay much attention to it. But then I watched the video Wally and Kimbra made, and I thought, \\"This is a really well-crafted song--and they both sing with such understated competence. This is good stuff.\\" So I bought the CD, and found that competence--and sincerity--were the operative words. I do see the parallel with Peter Gabriel (whose sincerity also shines); but not with Sting (who's too slick for my taste). \\"State of the Art\\" is funny--I'm not a musician, so my next comment may lack credibility, but it seems that Gotye has mastered sampling and layering to the point where he can weave lots of different sounds with an ease that allows him to deliver very rich and satisfying blends that carry credible emotional weight. \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" is a fresh reflection on climate change; \\"I Feel Better\\" and \\"In Your Light\\" are sweetly optimistic tunes that give the album a surprising emotional range. This is an album that can be listened to repeatedly--I speak from experience. I've listened to it about two hundred times and still look forward to popping it into my car's silly old CD player.
B004FS1TLM|3.0|The CD happens to have my one favorite recording of Michael Buble, Otherwise the rest of the CD is simply entertaining. Perhaps I anticipated different background music.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I liked the first one but this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i want my time and money back DO NOT WATCH!
B00631VJIC|4.0|COOL MUSIC OF ALL THE SONGS FROM SEASONS 1-4. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD FOR ALL THE DIE HARD SONS OF ANARCHY FANS!!!
0765340798|1.0|I enjoyed all the first seven books written by Frank Herbert and a number of the books that followed by his son and collaborator, but this one, as well as the one that follows it -- Hunters of Dune -- are too distasteful to me to read at all. There were a couple before this that were hard to read but worse came to worse with this one and with Hunters of Dune. I simply cannot stand reading them. They are both so full of grotesque imagery, torture, etc. I am HOPING some of the following books are better because after enjoying the first ten books I purchased the entire set thinking I was going to like them all. Big disappointment. I would MUCH rather read the character studies and such I got from the previous books.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|What can I say?  Its Offspring and another great album.  Brings back a lot of memories. I recommend their other CDs as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun and challenging the very first day I got it I had alreaddy beat the first screen but the second screen is harder
B0061S073A|5.0|I love that my 2 and 4 year old can't access my other stuff. I can pick what they have access to. My husband wishes he had this app for his IPad.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great for quick game play.  I have not yet unlocked all the games yet.  so far most are enjoyable and different. enough from one another to keep interest.  I like that the games are very brief yet somewhat challenging.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This item was perfect and exactly what I was looking for.  The stand works just fine and this is durable enough without being big and bulky.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I have Angry Birds and Angry Birds Rio. They work great. I tried Seasons, both the paid and the free versions, and neither will work. It starts to load, then crashes.  I complained to Amazon and got a refund, but they did nothing to solve the problem.  The software is still defective.  I have downloaded, installed and uninstalled Seasons almost 20 times now, and could not get it to work or get anyone to provide a solution. I wonder if they will ever fix the problem.  Also I wanted to point out a nasty secret about free apps that ask for alot of permissions, like access to your contact list.  Guess what?  They want it just to send you spam!  I never got spam until after Xmas when I started to download free apps, and now I get 30 junk mails a day!  Thanks alot!
B006ZMMBU4|1.0|I don't like movies with bad animation, lacklustre lighting and piss-poor storylines. Acting could be defined as worse than any foreign film I've seen in the past 8 years. I do not recommend Happy feet 2 at all. Simply awful. Bring your kids to see this? They will be bored to death and probably end up hating penguins.
0763644765|5.0|My daughter LOVES this book. It includes a lot of her most favorite things (which are beautifully illustrated): a cat, a dog, a mommy and daddy, and a baby! She loves to point out all the pictures and especially loves the line \\"I did it!\\" which she now repeats anytime she uses the potty. There aren't words on every page of this book, but I think that is a benefit so you can fill in your own story and you won't get so tired of the same book over and over again. Highly recommended!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Took the kids... It was awful... kids even hated it. Don't waste your money. Almost painful to watch!! Day would have been better spent watching ducks in a pond then this. Bet part of the movie was the nachos and popcorn we got before it started.
0071752854|5.0|Full disclosure - I've met Oren on two difference occasions and he has participated in a profitable venture I am involved with. Part of the reason for that venture was because of how much I loved the book.<br /><br />The idea of \\"pitching\\" - and yes, pitching \\"anything\\" scares me. I'm not good at sales - yet do it in my business as what I probably would have called a \\"necessary evil\\" until having read this book.<br /><br />Actually, back in full disclosure, this has been my second time through the book in a few months.<br /><br />This book is not only worth all the hype - but actually worth, in my opinion, more.<br /><br />Unlike other books I've read this year with the theme of \\"nothing really changes, here's how technology plays into what's been happening for a long time\\" - this book is about how this new age and new time has, simply, changed the nature of the pitch.<br /><br />You pitch old school, and it doesn't work anymore. You probably knew that already - but what is the answer to this new age?<br /><br />Enter \\"Pitch Anything.\\"<br /><br />A word of encouragement from Oren:<br /><br />\\"We are hardwired to be bad at pitching. It is caused by the way our brains evolved.\\"<br /><br />The hard reality the books deals with:<br /><br />\\"We assume that our audience will do what we want them to do if our idea is good, if we didn't stumble through the pitch, and if we showed a winning personality. Turns out, it doesn't work that way.\\"<br /><br />We all kinda knew that, didn't we ;-)<br /><br />The big idea of the book is FRAMES. You frame the pitch, the environment of the pitch, the psychology of the pitch, etc. inside of proven techniques that give you every advantage.<br /><br />The cool thing is, isn't is a book of funky mind tricks with elements of psychological warfare, it's a text about having the right story, having something worth \\"pitching,\\" not wasting anyone's time during the pitching process and more. These are the things I can get behind. It's about understanding that very \\"attention\\" the social media types love to talk on and on about.<br /><br />In the top level, a great read, with some great stories (turns out he once worked with one of my old bosses). On a deeper level, this is my text book for the next pitch I make.<br /><br />When I make that next pitch - I'm gonna bet 2 things<br /><br />1 - I'll do much better than I have in the past.<br /><br />2 - I will have read this thing a few more times between now and then.<br /><br />One of my new years declarations was that I'd read a book every week. Join me on this journey?

B005H0IW76|5.0|Michael Buble is a favorite performer of ours - we have seen him in person several times.  His Christmas album is now my favorite and I have Christmas albums going back to Johnny Mathis!  Love the selection of songs, his duet choices and the collabaration with Naturally 7!  Their style blends so well with Michael.
B004HYXW1O|5.0|I love this album! There's not a song on it that I would call terrible- knocked it out of the park.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I see this in the theater with my girlfriend and I have to say that it was the worst movie ever. I would not recommend this movie to anyone ever not even to little children 3 out 10.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|Overall this is a tough game with sleek interface and lots of replay value. Strategy aplenty, too.  Good luck! !!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game. It changes just enough as you go to keep it interesting and challenging. I hope to see more so I can keep playing.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was something different from the whole Vampires and Wolves love stories that had been out lately. This book had a nice twist to it. I had been meaning to buy this book and finally purchased it. Making this book the 1st book on my Kindle. I glad to say I was not disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app I play it everyday:) I have never had a problem with!  my two daughters only play this app.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The potential for this book was great but the direction and how it was written ruins the series of the first two books.  The book starts out well and great but soon takes a dive. The description and writing becomes hard to follow in the later scenes and dragged out. There are no romantic scenes or any really affection of love between the main characters even to the very end. The ending of the book is completely unexpected and is extremely disappointing. This book could of been great but the author never took it there she missed all the opportunities and turned it around. If the author was aiming for surprised and unexpected she achieved it. Surprised of how horribly this book is written and unexpected of how awful the ending is.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i really enjoy playing. it has lots of fun games. they are pretty easy to play and some what addictive
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Simply the best remote desktop app out there, and I've tried at least half a dozen. I really love the ability to use my desktop's native resolution, so that the placement of my icons is preserved.
B003H9MSPG|4.0|Let's discuss this fun piece of my nerf arsenal.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Shock & Awe: it's a big gun, even after you strip off everything you can without cutting the gun itself. This got soft cries of admiration from the Humans vs. Zombies college group I took it to. On that note, there are several easy places to tie this to yourself if you need a secondary blaster. Never underestimate the power of Shock and Awe in office wars.<br /><br />Almost Never Jams if you use the bolt-action at a consistent, reasonable speed and only feed it round darts. Darts that have been squashed into an oval shape by the clip or otherwise mangled are fare more likely to jam, but this is one of my LEAST jammy nerf guns. When jams do happen, they are easy to clear quickly.<br /><br />Neutrals:<br /><br />The Clip Loading System is my favorite because reloading is so darn quick, but storing darts IN the clips mean they'll get squashed into a shape that makes them more vulnerable to jams. This means you have to load just before you play: fine for some, not not great for office warfare, where you could be embroiled in conflict at any moment. The clip system is ONLY compatible with Streamline Darts.<br /><br />The Weight of this is less than the Stampede or Vulcan, but higher than the Recon, which is a very similar weapon. The Recon is small, reliable, and loads with clips, but lacks the Shock and Awe that only extra plastic can provide. I'm not very strong and enjoy this for home or office use, but will consider carefully before toting it all over campus again. The guys scoff at my complaints, however, so consider your own strength and usage model.<br /><br />Not Automatic: which makes it more reliable, less heavy, and chews up zero batteries. It also means you don't just flip the on-switch, pull the trigger, and cackle while your frienemies flee before you.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Not at all accurate, and the range just isn't there. You can pump out a lot of darts quickly without worrying about batteries or a jam, but the idea that this is a sniper rifle is just laughable.<br /><br />That's it. Enjoy your Nerf Wars!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|i really liked this app idk why but its a very fun way to explore the stars in our galaxy... i recommend this to everyone even if you do not like astronomy because it is really fun and its amazing in graphics and the best part about it is that people don't need to know anything about astronomy to have it, its just for fun haha.
B00479SVBU|5.0|What a great and inexpensive buy! It has disc quality sound (in my car), easy to use. Stop searching for a car mp3 player, this is the real McCoy.[[ASIN:B00479SVBU Soundfly AUX MP3 Player Car Fm Transmitter for SD Card, USB Stick, Mp3 Players (iPod, Zune, Sansa) with Remote Control]]
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great continuance of the first Hunger Games book in the trilogy. This book allows you to understand where things are going and helps set everything up for the last book. Another amazing read.
B00656C6KK|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to Doris Day's CD, \\"My Heart.\\"  It brought back many happy memories of Doris when she was at the peak of her career.  It was a very emotional presentation and very well done as a memorial tribute to her son, Terry Melcher, who passed away of melanoma in 2004. You can tell from the selections that she chose to put on this CD that she and her son shared many happy memories together.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderful conclusion to the Hunger Games Trilogy. The only thing I wish is that there was more info on what happened to the other characters, other than that it was an amazing book! Definitely miles away from the first book..read it and you will understand what I mean.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Do not let your children watch this, unless you want them to be mentally stunted. SUCH a cheap grasp at recovering some of the original vigor and well polished cgi, not to mention scripting of the original happy feet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read!! It was almost impossible to put it down and to be honest I really did not want to because I had to know what was going to happen next. The entire series is too good and great for people of all ages.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I was thrilled when I saw that Lego came out with a girly line of Legos. My husband is a HUGE Lego fan and my daughter loves them too, but she didn't have any Legos that really fit her interests. Until now! The only issue I have is I wish they were a little bigger. But she loves them and we plan on getting her the whole set over time.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Hopefully there aren't spoilers, but read with caution just incase....  I'm a long time Stephen King fan so I had to get his newest book (kindle and hardback). I read it in about 3 days, since pesky life chores get in the way. It wasn't an all together great book but I was glad I read it. The story was indeed interesting, but could have use some shaving down. The characters were fun (and who doesn't love when old friends drop into the story?) enough to be engaging. I was shocked at how it ended but glad he didn't take the HappyHappyJoy type ending many other authors would have been tempted to do.  I was bummed I had to look up a word or two (nothing like a new word to knock you down a peg or two), but it wasn't annoying enough to detract from the story.  All in all, I would recommend this book to any Stephen King fan; whether you love it or hate it, you should at least experience it. :)
030788743X|2.0|Before I begin, let me just say that I grew up in the 80s and consider myself nerdy enough to know all the references.  With that said, this book is fun, fast paced, and chock full of 80s references.  That's why people are giving this book such great reviews, no doubt.  But that doesn't mean this is a good book, or even worth reading.  It's far from well written, and having the 80s nerd references shoved down your throat at every turn is extremely grating.  The world and characters are shallow, the dialog is unimaginative, the writing is horrendous and much of the logic in the book is flawed.  But the worst thing about this book is that you can just tell the author is writing this solely for his own entertainment to show how much he knows about the 80s, and this makes you roll your eyes constantly and feel... icky.  I'm not recommending this book.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|The lightweight microshell is ok to a certain point. You have to set your kindle with the microshell on,placed on a hard surface.<br />If its on any other kind of surface like your sofa or bed it won't stay upright. So as long as you lay the kindle with the microshell on a hard surface like a table or a desk it works great. Over all I like the product and would recomend it to any of my friends.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I managed to replace several of my flashlights with just this one.  I love the fact that it uses AA batteries for simplicity and reliability.  It has 4 brightness modes so it can be used on low for camping, walking in dark places or at higher levels for long distance searching or security.  It has a nice solid feel to it and is waterproof.  It has good run times at lower levels and a constant brightness for the life of the batteries.  Many unregulated lights start out bright but drop down to 50% brightness when the batteries drop only 25% of capacity.  Well worth the price!
B000S0GYRU|5.0|I saw this movie in 1977 and almost walked out after the first 20 minutes because of the gory death scene. But if you like mystery and suspense, this movie is worth seeing. I have never seen such vivid colors--the school is a veritable cornicopia of color. Kudos to the set designer, whoever that person was. Argento must have a special affinity for blood red. The camera shots are pretty creative and there are several scenes that will make you jump. The music is some of the best I've ever heard in a horror film. Argento is amazing.  Like I said, I saw this movie in 1977 when it was first released and it has haunted me ever since. I had it on VCR but I finally bought it in DVD. By far, one of the most superior horror movies I have ever seen.  By the way, does anybody know what happened to the actress who played Suzy Banyon? She was fantastic, but I haven't seen her in anything since.
0307592731|4.0|This book is a highly enjoyable addition to the literature of outdoor adventures-cum-vision quest / walkabout genre. It reminded me of the Page Stegner book I read recently, [[ASIN:1582435375 Adios Amigos: Tales of Sustenance and Purification in the American West]], because the authors, in both cases, were given an opportunity to review their shortcomings, and to stretch beyond their limits.  It might be said that all good adventures provide such experiences; however, the level of intimacy these two writers share with their readers does make these books stand out in my mind.  Cheryl Strayed's adventure took place on the Pacific Crest Trail in 1995, a year that saw an abundance of snow that made the going difficult, and even impossible, through certain segments of the trail.  The hardships of the trail taught her humility.  She learned that, despite her knowledge of camping outdoors, she didn't know much about hiking, or how it differed from walking.  She had much to learn from others along the way!  Yet, her perseverance in the face of the challenges she met on the trail, which made quitting appealing, resulted in greater self-esteem and self-confidence.  Solo journeys bring to the fore the bigger picture struggles of one's life, if only because there is no one with you to divert your attention.  I admired Ms. Stayed discipline to that end, creating her solitude even as she enjoyed the camaraderie on the trail by purposefully limiting contact with others primarily to campgrounds along the way.  This enabled her to gain insight on the choices she had made for her life, the relationships that had caused her pain, some of the reasons for her drug use, and her responsibility to herself to move forward in her life.  Among her insights, the one that amused me most was her learning that the universe is never joking!  Another thing that struck me was her coming to terms with \\"not knowing,\\" and her compassion for her younger self.  She wanted, as we all do, to know the answers to the \\"why's\\" of our lives:  why did her mother die, why did what remained of her family seem to fall apart, etc.  Her conclusions are insightful: simple but profound, and perhaps exactly the conclusion that we all need draw from our own curious circumstances.  She writes from the perspective of 15 years later, having taken her walkabout in 1995.  This perspective provided a space in her heart for the child she once was, rather than continuing to harbor regrets, or 'beating herself up.'  This is not a how-to book but, if you are not a seasoned hiker and are planning a long hiking trip, solo or not, this book will help you to plan for success.  She has made almost all the mistakes for you!  And you will know from the beginning of your trip that all people who take this sort of journey run into unexpected challenges and even hardships.  You won't need the same amount of reassurance Ms. Strayed did from fellow travelers.  You will know that your struggles are not unique, and that your persistence will pay off in the long run.  A cautionary note:  the author acknowledges that, as a solo female, she was very fortunate that most acquaintances made on the trail were kind and helpful people.  She listened to her gut when they were not, and escaped unscathed.  Her decision to go it alone initially, with \\"no fear,\\" was based on her belief that her mother's death was the worst thing that could ever happen to her.  However, as she hiked, she did realize that she was taking a great risk that could have dire consequences, whether a result of her own misstep or an encounter with predators, human or otherwise.  As difficult as it might be to find a compatible companion, a companion provides a measure of safety that could make a difference between life and death.  Reading Wild will put you on the trail with Ms. Strayed, and I highly recommend it!  I looked forward to joining her every evening, just as she seemed to look forward crawling into her sleeping bag with a book each evening!  Her books were part of the story:  She provides a reading list to share with her readers!  While I felt her pain from her raw and blistered feet, and I shared her mental anguish as she burned segments of the books to keep the weight down to a minimum, having initially overburdened herself with her packing.  If you enjoy this subject matter and want to focus on \\"women's outdoor adventures,\\" two very good books from the 1990's, [[ASIN:1580050069 Gifts of the Wild: A Woman's Book of Adventure (Adventura Books)]] and [[ASIN:1878067303 Another Wilderness: Notes from the New Outdoorswoman (Adventura Books)]], are worth your time.  Another book I came across that might be of interest is [[ASIN:B001G8WJLS Going Alone: Women's Adventures in the Wild (Adventura Books)]].
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|The MPAA sells vapid and disposable movies, this is just another movie that will soon be forgotten. I am not at all impressed by it, and I implore everybody to investigate the MPAA and their corporate lobbying and illegal use of coercion to get politicians and ordinary citizens alike to shut up and not have any opinions contrary to what Hollywood sells.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is truly a fun solitaire to play! You can win occasionally. The options allow many personalizations. It can be played without an Internet connection.
B000I5XOW8|3.0|Picture quality was on par with DVD, not really sharp like Blu-ray.  I was kind of frustrated because I expected more, but it is better than DVD, so go ahead and upgrade if you get it cheap.  Definitely don't pay more than $10 for it, though...and don't expect it to compare to other Blu-ray titles in the picture quality.  Great, great film, though!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I am very impress with this product the resolution and the sound are with a great quality. The size is perfect ¡¡¡¡
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie isn't even good for kids. Its the sequel to a movie that was full of suck. Why risk it?
B006E4QCXU|3.0|I don't see how any could justify selling this tech demo at best for such a steep, relative to other apps price. There are several things that would need to be done first to justify the price tag not least among them a record and playback mode and the ability to customize the &quot;canvas&quot; beyond a rectangle.  As for the emphasis on the kindle that is even more baffling. The lack of physical keys and the auto hiding of the onscreen ones make using this rudimentary interface an absolute pain.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Thought I might make a couple of swirly things and be bored.....not.  Once I added color I was hooked. Also,  if you do a slow, rotating circle....the center condenses,  you can totally turn this over.....if you tap the middle ....it explodes in straight lines or circles.  Its endless....wish I could take screen shots to print. I like that you can reset it. Enjoy!
B0061TQBRK|5.0|dark adrenaline is absolutely amazing. Its heavy, emotional, intense and yes it is dark. The lyrics are gripping as always and love the energy this cd brings. Very difficult to listen to this cd without getting a little amped up. Havent stopped listening to it since i bought it and i dont plan on stopping.
0439813786|4.0|The book is beautiful and in excellent condition.  My 7 year old will be thrilled when he returns from school.  He earned 100 stars and instead of a nerf gun, he asked for Hugo.  Last evening we ordered two books by Brian Selznick, this title and Wonderstruck.  They both arrived today before lunch!  I was amazed as the UPS man pulled up!  Now that is service!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Before I purchased this cover, I was concerned with the negative reviews.  I tend to give more credence to the negative than the positives so I tend to gravitate there first.<br /><br />I can tell you that I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.  The cover fit perfectly.  There was no pulling and tugging with the elastic, the top cover stood up a little but after a couple of uses (bending it all the way back to view the screen) it sat right in place like a well-worn book.<br /><br />My favorite feature, when my Kindle fell out of my purse the cover protected it perfectly.  Not a scrape, not a scratch on either the Kindle or the Fire.<br />Best of all, I can keep my Kindle out on my desk at work without anyone knowing that I am sneaking peeks at my book throughout the day.<br /><br />Love this cover and I highly recommend it to go with your Fire.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Do not see this movie, your eyes will bleed. The first movie is always the best. ALWAYS. This movie is a waste of time.
B0053VKP8S|3.0|didn't end up a good solution for me as none of my headphones can use their volume controls when using it.  I ended up getting a pair of Sony Wireless Digital headphones online for under $200 (overpriced at Amazon at $299)and back in happy TV viewing land via the TV's optical audio out to the Sony's base/charger.
B000LE1FAY|5.0|It's hard to believe it's already been 5 years since this album was released.  I used to play it a lot when it first came out, and I still listen to it sometimes.  It's an unusual cd when compared to her other music, yet it somehow fits in the catalogue just fine.  I don't speak French so I have no idea if her pronunciation is right or wrong, and most of the time I don't know what she is singing about.  But I don't care.  The music is great and you get a sense of what the songs are about by the emotion in the music and vocals.  My favorite tracks have always been Des Ronds Dans L'eau, La Vie En Rose, Pourtant Tu M'aimes, Ne Me Quitte Pas, and Avec Le Temps.  I can listen to the whole album without skipping tracks, although my least favorite is Bonnie Et Clyde.  The album has a rich, full sound in the production.  The bonus disc has English versions of 4 of the tracks.  More would've been nice too, but maybe they wouldn't sound right, I don't know.  This is good anyway.
B0010X758Q|1.0|I bought this vinyl today and was disappointed. Warped edge, surface noise, and the audio sounds just like the CD! Avoid.
B001BWYZWA|5.0|This is one of the best sports movies of all time and a true story too!  What determination...brings a \\"lump\\" to my throat everytime I see how proud his Dad is at the end.  Reminds me so much of my Father who I love and miss very much.  This is a must see if there is anyone in the Country that hasn't seen it!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This was just an excuse to suck in some more cash, just like all of the Air Buddies straight-to-DVD movies. Yeah, it was bad and the only thing that made people see it was the big names they got into it and their 7 year old daughters.

B004EPZ0AM|1.0|Seriously how could a film be so bad. It reached a whole new level of badness. The film company should just shut down and stop making films
0525478817|5.0|The book was an excellent book and instantly became my favorite book of all time and most likely for the rest of my life (until John Green makes a better one). I feel nothing can surpass how great this book was. I wish I could tell you about the book but I believe you should get the book and read it for yourself because not one letter of the book should be spoiled.  DFTBA to all Nerdfighters
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Saw this in the theater. Extremly poorly made. Mudane, and boring. I could tell even my son started losing interest in this movie about 20 minutes into it. If you're looking for something to watch with your kids, look elsewhere. This one is just so poorly made, it's almost unbearable.
B00511ONPG|5.0|This is the best I could find to give me a summary of all I need to know about social media and marketing.  I found it so well written and so easy to follow, while still packed with information.  I will keep it close as a reference guide when I go into social media for my nonprofit.

0385738773|4.0|Great end to an interesting and engaging Dystopian Trilogy.  The writing was lacking a little in this one-it had more for a cliche feel to it, but very interesting over all.  I have some plot-hole questions looming out there in the aftermath-reading-haze but it still provided hours of entertainment and discussion amongst my book peeps.  If you are looking for something to read, I would absolutely suggest this series.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|First one was great and very funny, but this one just sucks.  They stretched the story out too much when they really should have ended it with the first movie. the humor is bland, the musical magic is gone, and it's just plain garbage.  DO NOT even waste your time and money on this trash. Straight to the trash bin.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Fun time waster app. Would be great if I could save as a wallpaper. Very surprised that it doesn't support multi-touch.
B005WGBOZM|5.0|Well acted!<br />Great effects!<br />Loads of emotions!<br />Easy to see whats coming next, but then there's an occasional twist, so one never really knows whats around the next corner!<br />As zombie flicks go I give AMC a 9.9 just because they \\"DID\\" the work, instead of talking about it!<br />A1.....
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|The game is fun and there are many levels. Plus there are mini games you can play or skip them if you want.  I think the money is a little high.
B003Y7AR4K|5.0|I purchased this DVD as a Christmas gift for my wife.  It's one of the most pleasing visual expierences we have had on our LED Flat Screen.  The quality is top notch in all aspects. (audio, visual, and choreography)  The 18 month old grandaughter loves to watch and dance to it.(in her grandmothers arms)  Consequently we put it on when ever she comes over.  If something happened to this DVD I would buy it again.
076115678X|5.0|The seller was quick with the transaction and shipping was quick. I would do business again with this seller. As for the book it has alot of information on curly hair. Things i didn't know about and I've yet to try and with that said I was very pleased!!!!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I was looking for a cover that would serve dual purpose for my kindle fire. I came across this cover under suggested items for the kindle fire. I was very excited to get this piece of equipment to utilize as a stand and cover. I've had it for about a month now. It serves great as a cover, but as a stand, not so much.  If the joint was a little thicker. Possibly it would have served better. But overall it's O.K.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|During my childhood, I have seen much, much better movies than this. Even for a children's movie, the plot was too degrading even for child's mind. This movie is an annoyance to both me and my children. One would probably be better off with the older disney cartoons. I've seen a newer cartoons that were actually good, but this was not one of them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has to be the best Bible app EVER! Especially for the Kindle Fire. I love the wide selection of reading plans and Bible versions as well as the fact that some of the versions have audio. The notetaking feature and the ability to share on Facebook and Twitter are definite pluses. Youversion also has an AWESOME blog with tips and great info. I REALLY love this app!!! Thanks Youversion!
B003TGMFG4|4.0|When I started this book, I was not happy with the way Chris walked out on his family.  I understand why he wanted to do what he did and I am glad that he got to experience what he wanted.  As a mother I couldn't help but carry that anger towards him through-out the book.  When I finally got to the end of the book, it really got to me.  I don't want to give it all away, so I will stop here.  It is worth reading.  I watched the movie after I finished the book.  I really wish they would of stuck to the book and stressed how the people he met told him to call his parents and to be more prepared.  We all wish we could do something like this, but in the end we need family and friends, when it was to late I think Chris realized this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fuuuun! you should try it. you will become hooked as well. I cant put this game down!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Great app. Mesmerizing,calming. Great use of the accelerometer. Definately worth the download. This is a great time waster too. Have fun all.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I went to go see this \\"movie\\" and wasted my time with this! I was begging for the movie to end! The animation was horrible and it looked like they rushed it. The story,plot,conflict,ending were all noncomprehending and I wouldn't imagine a child following through with this! Within ten minutes of the projected movie, I saw many kids asking their parents what was going on! When the movie started \\"Eric\\" immediately abandons his parents and goes with his friends! What is this film suggesting?!?!? Bottom line is, don't see this movie. The only part you will like is the ending credits.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Absolutely awful. I think I fell asleep in the theater trying to watch this movie. Not even my young relatives would enjoy this.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The graphics, the storyline and the puzzles are all top notch. Being a Grisly Manor fan, this was an insta-buy, but even if this is your first time with a FireMaple game, trust me, you're in for one hell of a ride
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Meh it was alright, but I've seen better. Kind of old, like we've seen this all before. Really got to stop with the sequels and come up with more original ideas. So repetitive. Really trying to milk it.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Rick Riorden has done it again! After the well loved Percy Jackson series ended, I was thrilled to hear hed be writing another mythelogical series. it was so good! Lots of fast paced action and humor made it very fun.

B005TD4GTO|5.0|I am an American OASIS fan. I was gutted when Oasis broke up in 2009 but the writing was on the wall. I knew something would come out of it and this is it. Noel G album is fantastic! love it! It is nothing new or way out there on experimentation. He stays with what he is good at, lyrics and music that we can all relate too. If you love the Gallagher brothers, buy this album AND BEADY EYE, both of them are good on their own and both brothers have done themselves proud. Keep the music alive and coming!
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Works great on MyTouch4g. But uninstalled because it's boring. It's like those desk toys that just take up space. I have better toys to take up space on my phone.
0060936223|4.0|Powerful, poignant memoir by legendary rock poet Patti Smith about her shared struggles to succeed as an artist with the controversial photographer Robert Mapplethorpe when they were, in her words, \\"just kids,\\" starting out as starving artists in the seedy underbelly of the late 1960's-early 1970's NYC. It's at times lyrically written, though not always as insightful or as revealing as one might like - we get next to nothing about how she came to the song by Bruce Springsteen that would make her legend, \\"Because the Night\\" - but it reads like Forrest Gump at times, with an unending stream of famous names that flash across her life: Allen Ginsburg buying her dinner at an Automat, thinking she's a guy; Janis Joplin crying on her lap because the guy she fancied left with a prettier girl; Jimi Hendrix talking about his dreams for making music on a stairway just before departing for his fateful departure to London; and a plethora of literary, music and art world notables of the mid-20th Century. As much as she was an early muse and lover for Mapplethorpe, who comes across as pure and innocent, though recklessly, and ultimately fatally, pursuing his own inner muse, we do get an intimate picture of the tortured artist effect, of the great effort it takes to produce art, poetry and/or music that moves and inspires others. Ultimately, of course, this book is a love story, requited, but tragic between two young people who always supported each other, held on loosely, and let the other flower as their life's pursuits took them in different but parallel directions over time.

140053271X|5.0|I know ereaders have been reviewed to death, so I will make my review short and sweet. I was considering the Kindle with Special Offers (cheapest version) but found a super deal on a Nook Simple Touch. I am glad I decided to go with B&N's ereader for the following reasons: nice matte screen; smooth, comfortable, curved ergonomic shape; epub support; longer battery life; touch AND button operation. The main downside for me is the lack of free books/special offers that Amazon does for the Kindle. B&N just doesn't have as many good deals or as often. Aside from that, highly recommend!
B004LWZW4C|1.0|Just as a warning for those buying the BD for European players!  The review is not about the movie, but about the fact that fox still thinks that they can ship products that are not for the world. Well, it doesn't play in Europe!

B004NGYXIM|5.0|This CD/DVD is amazing. I was waiting for that. Maná is the best latin rock in the word. Material recommended!!!
B004Q7DQLS|3.0|Dragon Bound was an okay book for me. I feel like I should have liked the book better because it had all the elements that I love. For example Hot alpha hero, check, Kick ass smart mouth but still girlygirl, check, paranormal plot with some originality and mystery check, but for some reason I just didn't love the book. I read it all the way threw and I liked the beginning and end but the middle lag some for me. I don't plan on continue on with the series because I just couldn't get into the story line and characters to want to read more. To each their own right? I gave it three stars for the originality of the plot and there were some hot and funny parts that I enjoyed.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|The movie was boring and poorly written.  No one laughed at any point.  This movie will make your kids dumber.
039472903X|5.0|Ogilvy wrote this book after a life-time career in advertising. The book is mostly about print advertising and is very good. I am not in advertising myself, but I believe a lot of the material is still valid. Ogilvy pioneered advertising research so his views were based on hard-evidence, for instance the fact that TEXT IN CAPITAL LETTERS IS HARDER TO READ. So this is not a book about an advertising guy who just want to be creative. It is about advertising in the service of business.
B005VPRG10|5.0|This Tie Fighter LEGO set results in a very solid-feeling, relatively large (around 1 foot tall) model that seems like it will be very durable and fun to play with.  The wings are definitely not going anywhere (unless you really pulled it apart) and it just feels sturdy.  The only minor exception to this is the cockpit cover, which falls off relatively easily when opening and closing it, but otherwise stays solidly in place.  The only downside to this set is that it's pretty boring to build.  The center module is moderately challenging and fun, and doing one half of one of the wings is also challenging and fun. The boring part is that each wing is identical, and each half of each wing is also identical, so you build the half wings four times and then attach them near the end.  The instructions are oddly confusing here too, because they put \\"x2\\" in several places, which made sense after reading through it all, but it actually meant you had to do big sections x4 (x2x2). Total build time about 1.5 hrs. Comes in three bags; first bag is center unit with two smaller bags inside, and other two bags are one wing each. If you can figure out how to share the instruction book, you could easily do these out of order.  If you're like me, and you prefer enjoying the end result that you built rather than the build process itself, the boring build isn't that big of a deal, so I still give it 5 stars.  I noted it here, though, in case it's something that's important to you.
0439023521|5.0|There are so many reviews that have covered the story line so I'm not going to bother. I purchased these books through the Kindle.<br />I just want to comment that I'm in my 40's and I enjoyed this series very much.<br />It has great characters, a lot of action, and it's a fast read. I hope the movie stays close to the story line. If it's successful and well received then \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"The Mockingjay\\" will most likely be made into movies as well. \\"The Hunger Game\\" books are as wonderful as the \\"Harry Potter\\" books are.
B004I1AGTC|1.0|LOVED the first Ip Man movie; everything was near-perfect in that movie.  Unfortunately the sequel, Ip Man 2, SUCKS.  Bad acting, bad story, lame fights and really horrible super cartoony English voice-overs.  Amazing they could do everything so well in the first film and so wrong in the sequel.  Even the English voice-overs were great in the first film, especially whoever did the English voice-over for Ip Man's character.  Bottom line: Buy IP MAN.  But DO NOT buy IP MAN 2.  NOTE: There's a third Ip Man movie, but I hear it's really really bad so will not even rent that one.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book was very good and definitely worth reading. I like a little romance and a lot of action & adventure so this was a great book for me.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I originally downloaded the sample and was not impressed.  Well, through no help from Mr. Jobs himself, the agency agreement has finally been held to be illegal collusion between Apple and the book publishers and the price of the digital edition fell to the point where I took a risk and purchased it.<br /><br />First off, this book is very long. It is as much a history of Apple as it is of Steve Jobs.  The early parts of the book that chronicle Steve's relationship with Steve Wozniak and others who would found Apple was interesting. Reading about a time where Steve Jobs had passion for innovation and learning was fascinating.  As the book progressed it became obvious that Steve was a narcissist and could not work effectively with other people. This ultimately lead to his failures as head of Apple and his ouster.  He eventually made his own name with NeXT and Pixar and, combined with Apple's failings in the mid-90's, made a triumphant comeback as the CEO. Too bad he kept treating the people working for Apple like crap. He always thought he was better than everyone else even up to his death.<br /><br />The book does tend to bog down quite a bit in the middle and focuses too much on the development of the iMac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad, etc. Yes, Steve had a large part in the aesthetic design of these products, but it is obvious that he wants history to give him complete credit for everything Apple produced while under his management.<br /><br />The book also seems a little too biased toward Steve Jobs historical legacy. Even though his faults are laid out, it is written in a way that almost presents him as a flawed god whose character weaknesses actually helped him achieve greatness. In reality he was a man who would take advantage of other people when it suited him and crush others who he deemed worthless.  Other than that, it is a good biography of a narcissist who achieved much during his life.

6305678715|5.0|What can I say, they're all young for a change would be nice. Connery, Harmon and Ryan at their prime if Connery isn't there yet he never will be. A death at the Presidio gets a former MP onto the case, especially after it was his former partner. Next the commander who had his hide over the arrest he made on a drunken officer. Then comes the affair he's going to have with his commanders daughter who doesn't like to commit. All of this is a back drop for the smuggling operation of former CIA operatives and an old friend and savior of the Lt. Colonel's from Viet Nam days. A thoroughly good movie and not all that dated except for seeing no cell phones. A young Mark Harmon isn't an unpleasant sight either. I'd recommend it if you can find it. It's hard to come by.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|Like many other reviewers, I was very disappointed in this book. It sounded like it was written by two sixth graders over summer break. Even if the story and writing were better, it was all so predictable. Just a stupid, stupid book.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! It's a \\"Rocky\\" meets \\"Transformers\\" and I found myself rooting for the robots and rooting for the humans at the same time. It was fun and enjoyable.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Gave this product as a gift.  My father loved it as much as I loved mine.  Another incredible album by ZBB.
0307454541|5.0|I have not seen the movie! The book is awesome. The plot is very interesting yet sometimes hard to follow because the setting is in Sweden and many Swedish words are used.There is a part in the first half of the book that is a little slow but overall it was well worth the time!
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|My husband and I started watching it on Netflix with Season 1. We were addicted. Had to watch Season 2 so since we don't have cable we get it from Amazon. Yes we feel that is has dragged on a bit much in the first half of season 2 but it is still an amazing show and one that my husband and I can both agree on to watch and anticipate the return of.

B004EPZ0AM|2.0|I saw it in theater happy feet two.  I didn`t like the little penguin peeing upside down in the movie.  but I saw it at a cheap movie theater with my girls and it was ok for only paying 10 bucks for the 3 of us.  I would only buy this on DVD when it goes on sale for 5 dollars, its not worth paying full price.
6304711905|1.0|The movie is greatly condensed and is like a copy right infringed movie, incorrectly called pirating sold outside the US. The picture is very small, like a video you might get in an email. I have a hard time believing this was produced from the theatrical authorized release for resale. I will be asking for a refund.
0307887898|5.0|So, I greatly enjoyed this book. Often books on entrepreneurship gloss over little details like logistics, strategy and such and rely on inspirational stories to sell copies.  This book does a very good job of focusing on the lean startup methodology and providing a scaffold framework for building a lean startup of your own.  My only critique of the book may or not be relevant to most readers. I was slightly disappointed by the continual emphasis of software and web startups in the examples and such and would appreciate some hard scientific/engineering startup examples. This is a minor critique as many of the philosophies highlighted in the book are applicable to any company, it would just have been nice to have seen some attention given to the unique challenges faced when a startup has the additional challenge of overcoming science (think pharmaceutical, biotech, etc).
030788743X|5.0|There is a prize inside the virtual world of Oasis. A prize that has been waiting there, locked away and nearly forgotten for many, many years. And one high school boy just found the first key.<br /><br />This book is so full of nostalgia for the 80's, referencing movies, games, and music that many of us grew up with. It is also a great commentary on what the internet could one day be, and touching on the battles of corporation trying to control it, and individuals trying to keep it free.<br /><br />It is also a marvelous quest through an amazing world. It one of the best books I've read in a very long time, and worth it to read. Even my daughter (who is now 17) read it and loved it.
B0002B15XI|5.0|(As I see it) One of the best war movies ever! People trying to make the best of a horible situation in a horribly forgotten war! Not making humor of war, but what you need to put yourself through to maintain your sanity. As relivant as it ever was. This movie will never seem dated.
B004NTDEXY|5.0|These are two great movies, and I'm very glad they were released together on Blu-Ray. I ordered it on sale for 8 bucks which is a steal, and it came in the mail two days later. Very satisfied, and very deserving of 5 stars.
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|At the tail end of the 19th century, Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) still feels like the wound is still fresh when it comes to his wife who died four years ago after giving birth to their son. Arthur is drowning in a depressive state that even his son notices. As a lawyer, Arthur is forced to travel to a secluded town to take care of the work of the now deceased Alice Drablow as a last ditch effort to save his job. Arthur is expecting to be buried in paperwork until the weekend, but the odd occurrences that transpire are a bit out of left field. Everyone in town practically begs for Arthur to return to London immediately as children continue to die gruesome deaths left and right. Ignoring their pleas, Arthur decides to confront the problem head on and stay at the Drablow's menacing house where his constant run-ins with the supernatural eventually take its toll on him.<br /><br />The Woman in Black is a horror film that I wanted to be good. It's Daniel Radcliffe's first movie outside of the Harry Potter franchise and he's been pretty enthusiastic about it in interviews, but every bit of promotional material seemed to point at the movie being your everyday, generic, run of the mill, \\"scary\\" movie. The Woman in Black does provoke your interest at first. The strange opening is a little hokey, but kind of intrigues you at the same time. The atmosphere the movie tries to setup is its strongest asset though. The heavy use of fog and old fashioned feel of the town does make the town feel like it existed in the late 1800s and the ominous score does its best to try and bring you to the edge of your seat. The Drablow house is the key to that atmosphere as it's absolutely gorgeous in this hideously grotesque kind of way. Everything is so dusty and creepy while the Victorian design only adds to that uneasy feeling the movie tries to stir up in the pit of your stomach.<br /><br />In the meantime though, everything else in the movie is working against it. It's extremely uneventful. Daniel Radcliffe reads papers, walks through a house, holds a candle, and gets a little dirty. That's the entire movie in one sentence. The Woman in Black also resorts to relying on nothing more than jump scares to try and scare its audience. There are four in the first twenty minutes; two from the same sequence and there are at least ten throughout the entire movie. Jump scares can be fantastic in small portions, but come off as incredibly weak when you can see them coming a mile away and are strung together haphazardly for a cheap effect. There isn't much dialogue while Arthur is in the Drablow house either, which is practically the entire movie. This was probably done to try and make the audience more absorbed with what was taking place on screen, but seems like a bit of a copout overall. Radcliffe has proven that he is an extremely talented actor, but he's pretty bland here. He mostly wanders around in a daze with a frazzled look on his face the entire time. His hosting gig on Saturday Night Live was more impressive in comparison.<br /><br />The Woman in Black will still be a very successful film as nearly everyone who was or still is a Harry Potter fan will be lining up around every street corner just to be able to see this movie, but the fact of the matter is that it just isn't a great movie. Its representation of the late 19th century is pretty good, but the writing, the \\"scares,\\" and (most of all) the entire conclusion are all just extremely disappointing. The Woman in Black is a watered down version of last year's Insidious that will more than likely gain a lot of praise it doesn't deserve.reads papers, walks through a house, holds a candle, and gets a little dirty.

B005P78VK4|5.0|I cannot comprehend why anyone would give this album anything but a five star rating. It is in my opinion the best remixes of Michael Jackson's hits that I have ever heard and I have heard almost all of them. I am a big Michael Jackson fan and I don't think that these remixes in any way take away from Michael's legacy. Quite the contrary, it adds to it. If you like dance music, you will love these remixes as they highlight the percussion and beats. My favorite is Dangerous. In fact, I like this version better the original. Also, I love the Smooth Criminal retake which, to me, is one of the best tracks. All of the remixes in this album are excellent. All of the singing is done my Michael Jackson unlike that infamous other album that was done posthumously which I don't need to call by title. Everything in this album is fresh. This cd has dominated the rotation on my stereo. I play it often and it's not just because I am a fan of Michael but because I love great dance music. Believe me, you will find yourself moving to the beats. Obviously this album was designed for a show but it makes the tracks even better in my opinion. I love this album and anyone who would say that I am not a true Michael Jackson fan just because I like this album is just plain stupid. It is still Michael Jackson's music. It has just simply been re-imagined and brought to a new stratosphere. This is the album I have always dreamed of. As for those who complained that the sound quality is not good, maybe they need to get a new sound system or get their ears checked because the sound quality is superb.

B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|Movies revolving around the supernatural have always felt lacking. Of course, the most recent ones are mostly remakes so they already have an uphill battle ahead of them but there are very few movies featuring ghosts or the supernatural that I feel are worth mentioning in a conversation about great films. Ghostbusters, The Orphanage, The Shining, Shutter (the Thai original), The Ring, The Frighteners, and The Devil's Backbone are about it for me. It's a sub genre of horror that just hasn't meshed well with me over the years much like exorcism films. In the same breath, I still haven't been able to get a clear read on what I think of Ti West as a writer and a director. The House of the Devil was really disappointing. Its slow pace made the film seem practically uneventful and didn't really feel worthwhile in the long run. The Innkeepers has a similar pace as The House of the Devil yet feels slightly more methodical on West's part in comparison.<br /><br />Luke (Pat Healy) and Claire (Sara Paxton) are the only two employees working during the final days of the Yankee Pedlar Inn. This hotel is rumored to be haunted by Madeline O' Malley, a woman who hung herself in her room after being stood up by her fianc&eacute; at the altar. Luke and Claire try to make contact with the paranormal through EVP recording devices in between watching the front desk and handling the few stragglers who come to stay during the hotel's final weekend of operation. Needless to say, Luke and Claire begin to see results as the guests at the hotel become a bit stranger.<br /><br />I'm surprised the score to The Innkeepers was as good as it was. It's a little bizarre to have such good things to say about movies coming out in between January and March since these are the months that studios decide to push whatever's been sitting on their shelf for a long period of time or release something they expect to do poorly at the box office. The score is really fantastic though, especially during the opening credits. It's usually very strings heavy and puts you on the edge of your seat on more than one occasion. It helps add that extra bit of tension. At other times, a lack of music speaks volumes. The way the film encompasses the importance of sound into the overall experience of the film is pretty extraordinary. Suddenly listening to a film is just as important (if not slightly more so) as watching it.<br /><br />The camera work is really spectacular, as well. Slow, winding shots make it seem as though you're grudgingly snooping around the corner along with the characters on screen. The camera's pace as it travels through the hotel's hallways make you feel like you're walking through it yourself. There are also several shots directly behind Luke or Claire that feel very third person. It's just extremely solid camera work that's more stunning than you may be expecting.<br /><br />The Innkeepers won't be for everyone though as it's incredibly slow moving. It crawls at almost a snail's pace, but it's the little things that keep you interested. Everything is very dialogue driven as Luke and Claire play tricks on each other and talk smack about each guest that comes to stay at the hotel. Claire's ghost story about Madeline O' Malley is around the time things really get interesting and Leanne's (Kelly McGillis) pendulum speech make the smallest things seem larger than they really are. The Innkeepers spends every expense establishing this thick, creepy atmosphere and is the prime definition of a slow burn at its finest.<br /><br />The Innkeepers may seem a little dull on the surface, but all it needs is a chance to let its layers unravel right before your eyes. Character development and a horror film that isn't in your face showing you every gratuitous and gory detail is almost unheard of anymore. With its unsettling score, its superb cinematography, and engaging script, The Innkeepers delivers a rare horror gem that's a breath of fresh air to the genre.ery strings heavy and puts you on the edge of your seat on more than one occasion.

B000V4UFZK|5.0|Great horror films age well, transcending decades with a unique universal appeal. It's a simple formula. When done well, with the best talents and checkbooks of Hollywood backing the project, it creates the kind of classic the 1982 film \\"Poltergeist\\" represents. Producer and writer Steven Spielberg, and to a lessor extent director Tobe Hooper (and his contributions are a controversy to this day), decided they wanted to update the ageless \\"haunted house\\" genre, transporting a fireside tale to the endless sea of modern American suburbia track homes. In doing so, they've created a big-budget horror extravaganza as warmly comfortable as [[ASIN:B001M432XA It's A Wonderful Life]]. This is not a criticism, though one has to admit \\"Poltergeist\\" lacks a certain hopelessness fueling the likes of [[ASIN:B00003CXCF Rosemary's Baby]], [[ASIN:079073804X The Exorcist (25th Anniversary Special Edition)]] and the greatest haunted house film ever made [[ASIN:B00009NHB6 The Haunting]].  I first saw this the week it opened and can still recall the audience screams when the paranormal expert stands before a mirror and later, the clown sequence. When the film finally ended, following an unbearable rollercoaster of suspense and exploding effects, as one we breathed a deep sigh of relief. Since that joyful experience, I have watched \\"Poltergeist\\" many times, owning a VHS and now DVD copy. I marvel at the overall package and its gentle brilliance.  From the opening scene, we are introduced to the Freeling family, an energetic messy mix of still-youthful California parents with three children. Casting is key here, and Spielberg made the same strategic choice he did with [[ASIN:B0008KLVG4 Jaws (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)]] by hiring unknown but talented actors for the leads. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams do not disappoint, carving classic, award-worthy portrayals of loving parents. While both actors achieved considerable success after \\"Poltergeist,\\" for better or worse they willforever be known for these roles, heartrending, touching and a perfect symbol of the undeniable strength of healthy parenthood. The main reason \\"Poltergeist\\" has achieved such enduring success is because of their extraordinary work, celluloid parents who can easily stand alongside the Hansons ([[ASIN:B0004Z322O I Remember Mama]]) and the Minivers ([[ASIN:B00011D1OU Mrs. Miniver]]).  Something is not quite right in the Freeling household as there appears to be a sinister presence stalking the youngest child (Heather O'Rourke) through the TV. There's soon a mysterious earthquake, scary thunderstorms and that tree outside the bedroom window is pretty creepy. These early sequences create growing dread, all the more impressive because they take place within warm, appealing domesticity. This leads to one of the most terrifying scenes ever filmed, and it's telling the moment is one of the quietest in the film. Alone in the kitchen one morning, Mother Freeling sees chairs out of place in the dining area. She replaces them and walks to a kitchen cabinet, returning within seconds to see them shockingly stacked upon the table. This unedited moment, taking place over roughly 10 seconds, will chill you to the bone. I've read this scene required a single take, with a strategy involving multiple off-camera assistants. It's unforgettable filmmaking requiring resource and ingenuity, rather than special effects, as horrifying as the twitch of Boris Karloff's hand.  Spielberg, as he often does, likes to have his cake and eat it too. Having effectively displayed the suspenseful muscle of a prime Hitchcock, he soon turns a bedroom closet into the equivalent of a drunken night at Studio 54, evidently a portal into another dimension where the \\"Beast\\" resides. The Freeling's daughter Carol Anne is kidnapped by ghosts in the dead of night, and they must recruit paranormal experts to save the day. \\"Poltergeist\\" never lets up and just when you think those pesky banshees are gone, they come back for more. Similar to the casting choices of the Freelings, Spielberg achieves perceptive wonders with the actors portraying the paranormal experts. Beatrice Straight, in her best role following her Oscar-winning success in [[ASIN:B000I5SY9Q Network]], portrays angelic balance as the supportive spiritual leader Dr. Lesh (in a role originally intended for Shirley MacLaine). A young Richard Lawson also provides fine work as Ryan and, of course, Zelda Rubinstein as the famous, Hobbit-like psychic Tangina. Their colorful efforts to document and overcome this sinister gang of ghost demons are thrilling moments of unbearable tension.  I suppose the eventual explanation for the haunting is unbelievable as one would imagine when building homes and swimming pools construction crews would have to dig deeper than \\"six feet under.\\" But by the time this skeleton in the closet is offered, \\"Poltergeist\\" has already won us over multiple times. What Spielberg has brilliantly achieved, and where his mastery is on the level of his classic [[ASIN:B000A2IPP0 E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition)]], is in creating a fantastic middle-America story fit for the entire family. Granted, preschool children (around the age of Carol Anne) would be traumatized by this film, but young teens and their parents can watch this on Halloween eve and marvel at the amusement park thrills. Steven, at the height of his unparalleled filmmaking wonder power, has recreated the timeless ghost story with the only victim a bird in a cage. This film is so good even the two terrible sequels that followed have been forgotten, unable to dent the reputation of its original (ironically, similar to the \\"Jaws\\" sequels).  \\"Poltergeist,\\" a work of uncommon imagination, should ultimately be studied in film classes as one of the greatest horror films ever made.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|I don't generally rent R-rated movies but thought I would give this one a chance since I was looking for a comedy and generally enjoy the acting of several of the actors in the movie. All that this movie did was make me more committed to not renting R-rated movies! Jennifer Anniston, what were you thinking in taking that roll? Yikes! You're a better comedic actress than this!
B006E4QCXU|4.0|very calming app. i like that the colors can change depending on which last was interacted with. it simple, yet beautiful, with some neat options.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|A mesmerizing app. It's fun to watch the swirling stars twist and float with lovely colors. You can tweak the controls and experiment to pass time. The only downsides are that the controls are a pain to navigate and switch between on a kindle fire and you can't save what you come up with.

B006AX6ONI|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. It was well written and had lots of great ideas as well as inspiration for entrepreneurs (as well as those looking for a job). For the price, I'd say it's a must read for any body running (or thinking about running) their own business.  Like Mr. Cuban says in the book, even if you only get one thing out of it, it's worth it; and at this price it's a no brainer.  Buy the book, you'll be glad you did.

097747609X|4.0|A good political read, very interesting to hear Hitler's rationale contemporaneously. Two things bother me about this book. The edition itself is not the best edited, a few spelling mistakes here and there, frequent enough to be noticable. Second,the back of the book, which sells Hitler as an \\"evil genius\\" or \\"monster\\". Mein Kampf has its own merits and logic. It is counter-productive to dismiss the book as worthless. Hitler was not a monster, he was a human, and reading this book helps you understand how people are able to act like monsters. Censorship of literature is a hallmark of fascist states, and I think its a shame that there is in some quarters consent that the content of the book is worthless, or that only a Hitler sympathiser would read it. It is as worthwhile as any book written by a political leader would be. Interesting to me was how Hitler provides commentary on his own assumptions. For example, before launching into a tirade against democracy he describes how he came to admire democracy, and how then he came to hate it. He is self-aware of his own motives. I was shocked to hear him admit to being \\"uncomfortable\\" with anti-Semitism, being rather liberal at first (he thought Jews were discriminated against for their faith, which he considered intolerant). Then he describes how he came to hate the Jews himself. This also belies the sometimes voiced defence that there was no anti-Semitism in Austria/Germany pre-Nazis. It is interesting to see in his more obviously political statements how he blames Jews for many problems, an obvious form of propaganda. Very obvious in fact, because he describes the power of propaganda in detail. I found this a fascinating read.  Recommended to anyone who has an interest in history, politics, and sociology.  Other primary sources are [[ASIN:1469920204 Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts: Eine Wertung der seelisch-geistigen Gestaltenkämpfe unserer Zeit.

B0034JKZ86|1.0|So disappointed in Disney!!!  We purchased this movie for our daughter for Christmas and just watched it and it is going to take a straight trip into the trash!  The movie has many positive messages such as showing a traditional hard working family who instills values such as not to allow greed and the seduction of success to cause you to loose sight of what really matters in life.  HOWEVER, a large element of the film shows voodoo practices of a very scary witch doctor and also a \\"good witch godmother\\" who \\"saves the day\\".  All I have to say is this movie, although it has some good messages, is overall DARK...VERY DARK for young ones to try to comprehend and not be completely scared of!  I understand that the movie is set in New Orleans and that is part of the \\"culture/history\\" there, but Disney did not have to highlight the voodoo to such an extreme as to make the movie totally scarey for children!  Definitely too many adult themes to be just a G rating and hard to see the positives out weighing so many inappropriate negatives!

0307959856|2.0|I was unsure about this book from the very beginning. The reviews were so mixed. Finally I decided to read it for myself and I was disappointed. I did not find the story or characters very engaging. The portrayal of Colonel Fitzwillam and Charlotte Lucas I found disagreeable. The bringing in of characters from Emma somewhat randomly at the end - unnecessary. The repetition of the same story from different characters and then a repetition of P&P dialogue in the epilogue irrelevant. Overall, a rather disappointing read

B0059XTUXQ|1.0|First, the good point of the movie - Streep's acting.  Meryl Streep is a wonderful actress and she gives, as you would expect, a great performance.  Now the bad points of the movie - everything else.  This movie was not at all what I was expecting.  If you're going into the theater looking for a movie on the history, life and career of Margaret Thatcher, you are going to be as bitterly disappointed as I was.  The movie focuses on an elderly Thatcher, retired in her home and apparently losing her mind, as she spends a good deal of the movie conversing with the hallucination of her dead husband.  We get disjointed spurts of Thatcher's history thru a series of short flashbacks.  But these flashbacks offer no real insight into her career, certainly not any kind of cohesive history.  The flashbacks seem to be there only to highlight the regrets of an elderly Thatcher, tottering around her apartment alone, relegated to the sidelines by both family and friends alike.  The movie is tedious and slow and before it was halfway over, I was bored.  I was also a little mad.  Margaret Thatcher was the preeminent female figure for the better part of the 20th century: a political powerhouse.  She was the first modern woman to rise to a position of real power and influence.  Her career opened up a path for other women in politics and her decisions helped shaped the course of Europe.  The title of the movie is The Iron Lady and Thatcher, with all her good points and all her flaws, was powerful and strong and determined.  So it puzzled me why the movie seemed determined to turn her into a parody of female flaws and weaknesses.  She is portrayed as a selfish mother who chose career over family;  a distant wife, who takes her husband for granted until after he is dead; and a catty, overbearing woman who nags and bullies her constituents.  It is a completely skewed portrayal of Thatcher - unflattering and I suspect for the most part, untrue.  This movie does not even come close to doing justice to the story of Margaret Thatcher.  It actually has a very anti-Thatcher, anti-woman vibe to it.  The writers have presented us with a morality play with a clear \\"lesson\\" woven in:  \\"See!\\", the movie seems to be saying, \\"This is what happens to upstart women who abandon their families and their rightful place in pursuit of their career.  They end up old and alone and regretful.  Beware! Beware!\\"
0470638842|5.0|The influence of technology (in particular social media) and business is not going away. While there are plenty of \\"experts\\" out there writing and speaking of this new normal, few present in an easy to understand way like Erik Qualman. The book is an easy read and really stresses the importance of engaging and listening to the customer. This book is applicable for anybody in business from C-Level on down.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|The film is boring and the company that distributes it is terrible. I would definitely not watch any more of their films.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|It was ok for about 20sec, then I had enough.  There I'd nothing wrong with it, it is just not for me.
0061726826|3.0|I'm a bit on the fence about this one. I have to admit that Lauren Oliver is an amazing writer and have a way with words that makes the book come alive. I can see the setting perfectly, the sky, the sea, Portland, the government buildings. Also, when I read, I can clearly feel Lena's feelings, her fear, her anxiety, and her happiness, but despite the magical use of words, it was kind of a slow paced book. After a while, I just want to know what happens. I don't need to read about every little thing Lena was feeling and have them converted into a metaphor.  Lena was a very well developed character. She has definitely been brainwashed, but we see other reasons why she's so excited for the cure, due to her past. It was interesting to see her struggle against everything she's been taught once she's met Alex, struggle to see the truth through the lies. I admired her determination in the end to escape from this world.  As for Alex, I'm indifferent about him really. Since the book is from Lena POV, we only see Alex through her eyes, and it's kind of hard to get a complete grasp on him. Personally, I'm used to the romance genre where I really know what my heroes think. Besides, teenage guys are just not for me anymore I guess. I much prefer their more mature and sexier versions in my steamy romances. I also didn't get how Alex was special, other than the fact he was an Invalid. He just didn't stand out.  Lastly, the thing that drew me to the book - the premise. I love how Lauren Oliver created an entire society, with their version of God and fairy tales and history, but I just don't see how this could ever happen. Yes, I know there should be a suspension of disbelief. Otherwise, how can I like vampires and werewolves right? But for dystopians like this, I don't see how our society could ever reach that point. Other books usually use war as explanation for the changes, but this one didn't really provide one. I cannot see how anyone could accept that love is a disease and actually willingly gives it up to be cured. It just wasn't plausible.  My favorite has to be the last scene. Simply EPIC. Part of the reason this is getting 3.5 and not 3.  If only because of this book's ending, I will read Pandemonium when it comes out, but I think I still like the Hunger Games more.

0783222149|4.0|Movies come in all shapes and sizes and are made to serve different purposes. \\"River Wild\\" is a 'sit back and enjoy it' adventure/ thriller.  Here's the scoop. Meryl Streep is having problems with her workoholic husband, David Strathairn, who might again bail on their yearly boating excursion down a wild river. He makes it at the last minute but the trip is interrupted by the likes of three no-gooders who just robbed a cattle auction and plan to use Streep to escape down the river and through \\"The Gauntlet\\" a nearly impassible stretch of rapids.  This is a well crafted, well directed thriller. I'm not certain where it was set but it quite possibly might be Washington State. The scenery is used to great effect combining both beauty and menace. This was about midway in director Curtis Hansen's career and though not up to his later \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" it's still a heck of a ride. There are a couple of thrills that are of the cheap variety but much else of what goes on is more than watchable. For instance: When they hit \\"The Gauntlet\\" it's a real nail biter. And when Streep informs them, while laughing uncontrollably, what's going to happen to them when they get there, it's something to behold.  Streep is her usual good self in an a-typical role. Strathairn is good as well. Kevin Bacon does well as the bad guy. He starts out nice, but when push comes to shove he becomes ruthless and will kill without a second thought. I like John C. Reilly as Bacon's side kick, and he's good here. I do wish they would have fleshed out his character a bit more.  This isn't great art but it's very good craft. It won't change your life but it will keep you well entertained for all of its 108 minutes.

0060873027|1.0|I was led to read this book by a student of mine.  I've been a Crighton fan for years, although I must admit, I haven't read one of his for awhile.  That being said, I was very disappointed in the overall quality of the book.  The initial couple chapters held promise but as soon as the \\"graduate students\\" show up, the book takes a precipitous dive.  The item that frustrated me the most was the absolute silliness of the dialogue, particularly among the students.  It was all I could do to make my way through without laughing.  I doubt that very few people in such straits talk like the author wrote.  I've not read one of Preston's books, but after this, I'm highly skeptical.  Not an intelligent or entertaining read.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|After immersing myself into Born to Die, I found myself humming the playlist of tracks throughout the day.  \\"Video Games\\" and \\"Blue Jeans\\" alone are reasons to explore.  But along with these are \\"Dark Paradise\\", \\"Million Dollar Man\\", \\"Born to Die\\", and \\"Summertime Sadness.\\"  There are some tracks that lack both in lyrical depth and musicality and resort to more basic pop but because Lana Del Rey honestly sounds so different from any other artist I've come across, they feel new and not trite or mundane.  You can feel almost a sarcasm in some of her songs as if she is trying to paint this image of who she wants us to think she is or maybe it's who we want her to be, but really in truth, she is broken and insecure and in search.  Love the sound, love the album.

075640407X|4.0|This book captivated me enough that I stayed up late several nights reading it.  The author creates an engaging and vibrant world that I enjoyed learning about.  The hero is talented and likable yet flawed enough to avoid being a caricature.  These are enough to earn it multiple stars.  My disappointment with the book stems from the many questions it raises and leaves unanswered at the end.  This is unabashedly only the first volume of a multi-volume work, and it doesn't even pretend to be a self-contained story.  In fact I would describe the ending as more of an anticlimax than anything else.  If you like books with a proper ending then you will be disappointed.  If you don't mind being strung along through several more volumes before the author reveals his secrets, then this book is a good choice.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|The only context i could possibly enjoy this movie (?) in is one in which i am sedated at the dentist. Maybe.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|should be able to save screen shots, have mutiple colors at the same time, playback of what you did. Droid X
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Looks like table salt to me. Which isn't a bad thing. Unless spilling salt on your phone scares you.  ;)  I wish if you left your finger down everything would collapse into a black hole, basically, and not just continue to scatter.  Used on Galaxy Nexus ICS 4.0.  Very cool, though.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I have been very pleased with the MicroShell Folio cover by Marware.  It fits the Kindle Fire very well.  It is well made, adds minimal weight and the cover makes a nice stand for watching videos on my Kindle. It is a very worthwhile investment.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|MPAA made this movie into a filmed abortion. i would rather see a genocide, start to finish, than this abomination.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game awesome nice good I am glad I downloaded this app because it keeps me from being bored out of my mind.
B00425S1H8|5.0|This console cable works great with my Cisco router. The USB cable is longer than I need but I guess that really isn't a huge deal.
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|product at a good price in excellent conditions,better price than regular stores, got it within a week,love desperate housewives,really like the amazon system,great selection.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|rip off its games don't work and it costs but it free make games that are fun I think u the kindle fire should yet temple run
1933492929|3.0|I purchased this a year ago and have yet to find any real use for this book. I must admit the artist is very creative but this book is not a good tool for teaching. The book makes no attempt to describe the process of creation aside from providing a short biography and a portfolio style collection of pictures. Personally, I wanted to break out from the alien/reptile-like creatures that been done before in films. It did not help me reach that goal as the bulk of this collection is just that.<br /><br />My advice for anyone looking for instruction on the process of creating creatures that don't exist and make them look believable to look elsewhere.<br />If you are a fan of the artist and are looking for an excellent portfolio of her work you will be delighted.
B003L1ZXCU|2.0|This fast-paced technothriller is a bit too fanciful with the potential of computer technology to be believeable. If you're not too familiar with computer technology terms, you might not like the constant barrage of technical jargon, and even you are, you might think the limits of what is possible with AI today makes the idea of the Daemon very implausible, which gets even worse as the Daemon extends its grasp into the contemporary world. It made it difficult for me to suspend disbelief for the whole second half story. The book runs on a bit too long anyway and would have benefited from a trimming edit.
1451627289|5.0|really not much about JFK, but the parts that did address that day were outstanding.  any baby boomer will tell you what a loss of \\"childhood and hope\\" that was that day.  if you were alive then and compare that to 9/11, 9/11 did not have the loss of hope  11/22/63 had on my generation. WE KNEW very bad things could happen after 11/22/63, 9/11 only confirmed the \\"repeat\\". so much promise, gone in the 1960s, MLK, then RFK, too painful the loss.  the \\"love story\\", in the middle of the story 11/22, didn't make it for me, didn't seem real. what was refreshing was to hear  SPOILER ALERT  that JFK did make it, and it was very real, the events after that \\"near miss'.  I swear that was what really happened, not the actual events we know.  If only...  Have to give King credit for going beyond and telling us what the changed world would have been.  AND that could have been the effect of a major change in the past.  anyone that knows the \\"Twilight Zone\\" knows somethings from the past cannot be changed.  With all the above said, if I could go back and change 1 thing in the last 50 yrs or so, it would be the \\"recount' of the Bush v Gore.  no one needs to die for the change, people just needed to work harder for Gore.  What a very different world and earth we would be living in, and so many lives would have been saved by  NOT having the 2 wars.  Did not realize how important that election was until  8 yrs later.  so hats off to King for not only following the idea, but showing us the other side of the coin.  a must read for baby boomers.  By the way, not really a King fan, liked some of his books, others left me cold, but this is a book and idea you will think of long after the last page.  thanks for the reviewers that recommended \\"Replay\\"  also a great book.  THAT love story was one I could believe in, unlike the one in 11/22.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|some what fun get it get or be dumb al get it ok better then any get it it best
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This app is amazing! I've never seen anything like this before. The description of this app was spot on. I'm truly enjoying playing with it so far. A plus for me is that my 4 yr old likes it too. Awesome on the Kindle Fire!  Great free app of the day!
B005RYF5JA|4.0|We've enjoyed the song from hearts and a new journey, so I pre-order this DVD as a gift for my wife.<br /><br />We watched in our home theatre the night we got the DVD.<br /><br />The quality was good, sound was nice. If I haven't seen the previous two DVDs, I might actually think it was okay. But knowing the previous DVDs and this one was very, unimpressive. At the end we actually still looking for an exciting song.<br /><br />A lot of the singers disappeared. Some were not totally great but we used to their moves and voices. So having only Lisa and Chloe was disappointing. The new Lisa is pretty but, she is quite showy and different, doesn't really blend in well. Mairead looked a bit uninspired this time also. I guess we were expecting another 100% masterpiece, and could not tolerate an 80% performance.<br /><br />The Songs choices are a bit strange as well. Other reviewers had mentioned, I concur.<br /><br />For $14 this is an okay purchase but, if you are new to the band I would recommend the preview two DVDs which are 5 stars. This one is a 4-star.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|What I liked most about this product (initially) was the price. I had been looking in retail stores for anything comparable but was turned off by $40+ asking prices. This product was exactly what I wanted: no frills, durable, good looking. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a protective case for their Kindle Fire.
B00015YVDG|4.0|One of the classic Mel Gibson films, \\"Ransom\\" is one of those movies which are no longer made nowadays. With a Mel Gibson in the best moment of his career, an exciting story and a great supporting cast, this film provides great entertainment as well as fantastic interpretations. The tension is very well built up, leading to an exciting climax with a fantastic final battle, and in whole the film is a great example of what the action-thriller genre used to be.  As for the edition, it provides a great variety of bonus contents which allow us to explore the making of the film and the opinions of the cast.  In general, a completely satisfying product which you won´t regret to purchase!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I need help figure out the flower box puzzle where you can change them from red blue and green. otherwise this game is great!
B0000062Y2|1.0|I am no audiophile but, Jesus Christ Superstar, what were they thinking when they remixed this CD reissue? Those who did this deserve to be crucified! The cassette tapes I bought the soundtrack on in the 80s sound way better. Lucky I kept them.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This is the coolest and always makes me appreciate technology and the hard work that must go into creating stuff like this!
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|If it's sold by Amazon, it's the official Apple product like pictured.  I had previously bought the Amazon Basic cable which is similar but I had a lot of issues trying to get it to work.  Sometimes it would work while other times it wouldn't.  I'd have to quit the app then try to go back and forth...  There seemed to be no pattern to it.  Some people said it worked for them but didn't elaborate on that.  It was a headache.  I'm using an iPhone 4s with OS 5.0.1. so I would have thought it would work.  Turns out no.  None of those problems with the Apple cable!  It works as it should with no quirky issues.  Yes, it costs more but then it actually works!  Video, Youtube and even Netflix works without having to fiddle with any settings. Just plug it in and turn it on.  It's that simple, like it's supposed to be.  About 3ft from the sync plug is the first split. USB and Video are separate from the Audio.  7\\" from the end is another split for the two audio plugs.  This gives you some flexibility when the TV doesn't have built-in USB to charge the device.  As they say, buy once, cry once.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|The seller gave a great description and it arrived in good condition.  The packaging was sturdy and arrived quickly.  I purchased this for my daughter, she is thrilled with it. My entire family enjoyed watching it together.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|First of all, I am soooooo not a rap/hip hop person and own no other rap albums other than this one but what caused me to buy it was one, Moment 4 Life is my jammmmmmmm and after sampling the whole album, it didn't sound too bad.<br />Now I see other people are putting this album down because it's a not a full blowout rap album as some songs, she is actually singing but I think that makes it all the more unique and she has a nice voice so I'm glad she chose to utilize both her rap/singing skills. I just enjoy her transparency on this album and her voice is so catchy, there's no escaping it.<br />As far as comparing her to Lil Kim...seriously? 2 totally different people who walk in 2 totally different times. Period. Let Nicki do her thing cause she does it very well. And again, this is coming from someone who does not purchase hip hop whatsoever and out of all the hip hop albums out there, I think \\"Pink Friday\\" is one for the books! God bless :-)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the variety of games. just wish it would not take so long to be able to unlock them
B0027UY8B8|5.0|This is the region-free Battlestar complete collection from the UK that will play in any region Blu-Ray player.  Fantastic series in the highest resolution possible.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|A listen to Disk 2 of this set brings the experience of having The Doors in your living room performing a live audition of what they've assembled for their \\"new album\\" (circa 1970). The alternate performances are a fun listen as the songs are well developed but with some rough edges to be negotiated. The sound quality is wonderful. The obvious lack of added reverb and echo on the vocals & instruments  has the group really sounding as if they're right there in your presence. The two tracks included that did not make it to the official album are no great shakes - as other reviewers have noted - but I think even more casual fans will enjoy the different takes on the classic tunes.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|The movie speaks for itself. It's a classic Christmas film. A must see during the holidays. I'm glad to have it in Blu-ray at a great price from Amazon.com. Shipping was fast, as usual.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has so many different types in this it pulls you in. some levels are tricky but with patience you do fine
B000002KDO|5.0|In the early 1970's bands/artists were still singing about peace and love. Sabbath were too only they were much darker and I think much more honest than your average \\"try to love one another right now\\" bands. On this album Sabbath chose instead to say \\"tell the world that love is still alive, you must be brave. Or,you children of today are children of the grave\\". Every song on this album is great, but the best are, in this order After Forever, Children of the Grave, Into the Void, Lord of this World and Solitude.Black Sabbath are classified as a \\"metal\\" band but I think they are much better than that. They were way ahead of their time and this album is solid proof of that. If I could only own one Sabbath album,it would have to be Master of Reality.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|love it, my 3 year won't stop playing it, great time waster, never gets boring.  maybe more features and options, like how strong of a magnetic pull I have on the stars.
B0043URV5U|4.0|Bob Seger is one of the most enjoyable artists getting constant rotation on the Classic Rock stations. This collection provides all the great tunes from the 70's and 80's: Night Moves, Old Time Rock and Roll, Against The Wind, along with great album cuts like Fire Down Below, Her Strut, etc. The sound quality is very good, clear and in your face. In other words, the collection is what you would expect, but doesn't serve up much that's different. If you own Live Bullet, Night Moves, Stranger in Town and Against The Wind, you don't need to buy this collection to get a handful of other songs like the dated single Shakedown, the heartfelt but redundant Like a Rock, etc. This collection is a nice trip down memory lane for casual fans or fans of classic rock in general, but won't satisfy serious fans of Bob Seger's long career.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|I'm probably the oldest BTR fan around (will be 53 in a few mths. - yes, I admit, it's kind of gross).  My 11 year old son and 7 yr. old granddaughter have been bonkers for this band & their show on Nickolodeon since its inception. Great catchy tunes, amazing voices & I find myself laughing out loud when watching their program. Anyone my age or a little older will certainly remember the Monkees from the 60's - well, they've been reincarnated! Good clean fun is definitely missing on TV today, but this hits the mark. Bought my son concert tickets as a Christmas gift for the Vegas show in two weeks. I'm embarrassed to say that I am truly looking forward to this. Unfortunately, my son will have to someday admit to attending his very first concert with his mother:-) :-) :-)  Aah yes, this little bit of info. will come in handy - after all, the teen years are just around the corner.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard Cohen at his best. Poetry, music, and the golden voice. You can listen to his singing over and over again and still be thirsty and and never have enough. Thank you Master Leonard. Amen. Amen.
0061992860|5.0|THis is the perfect size. very small and compact but easy to understand and read. there are pictures that are very easy to understand and see. colored photos as well. i love it! great gift for your survival/camper
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lot of force closing. ok app to pass time.  some games lag a bit.  really like the sushi game. lots of fun.
B001HBYH9Q|3.0|The story was really a typical one. The only good thing about the movie is Hugh Grant, he acts well and he's very handsome !  The picture and sound quality was not good at all.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|A basic case for your camera. Feels very high quality although the price is very low. Buy one for your point and shoot.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|If you like photos of nebulae and such, you will absolutely love this. Best free app so far. Great for all ages.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I'm not really sure what this movie tried to accomplish. The dancing bears, with tons of closeups of feet. Sick.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie was absolutely lacking.. I don't know what it was. I felt like I payed $8 for the popcorn and drink...
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie is such a waist of money, for the amount I spent for my 7 year old, 8 year old, and myself (plus snacks and drinks) to see this drivel at the movies I could have bought more of the same snacks and just let them watch cartoons at home. It would have been the same experience; flashy colors, catchy music, and no point to the story.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Not a very good movie. The first one was better, and this one was a big let down. Okay voice acting but it seemed like they weren't even paying attention to their lines at times.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|i really like this app especially since its free, but i cant figure out how to start over once you add Colorado or something lie that at first i could push optimize, but now since i added doors and stuff, i cant make it start over
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game really is great. Its fun to play, passes the time and takes the mind away from life's worries LOL! If u like brain type games, you'll like this game.
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|The dark gritty underworld of outlaw motorcyle clubs is fantstically portrayed and explored in Sons of Anarchy. This show is also not procedural like so many of the fan favorites and \\"best shows on TV\\". This series keeps getting better and better as the seasons progress.
0439023483|5.0|My daughter encouraged me to read this book. I was afraid it seemed too depressing, and let's face it, life can be depressing enough. Instead, I found it encouraging and strengthening ! I am so happy that I read it and am ordering the other 2 books on my kindle.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book.  The world she presents is very interesting, the main character is well developed, and the reading flows well.  The plot is riveting, making this a book hard to put down.  It was easily accessable as far as science fiction goes and is going to make a great movie here soon.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|horrible horrible film made by horrible horrible people so that they can make money and extradite people.  screw the MPAA and any of their movies
B005OK81HA|4.0|Cool C.D .The covers are really good \\"Across The Universe\\" and \\"Tainted Love\\" are the best.The remix's aren't that special but I like these type of projects, they're interesting.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|It was really not worth the time watching this movie.  I almost fell asleep quite a few times while watching it!  I drank coffee and everything.  This movie is just so bad...
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I can't believe anyone has complained about this. This 'game' is fabulous. The most unique app I've seen. Also a great way to have your children turn on their brains. It's not challenging, but certainly creative. Wonderful.
B0074FV6XO|1.0|I JUST BOUGHT THIS EPISODE AND IT DOES NOT PLAY!!! WHY AM I SPENDING MONEY BUYING SOMETHING TO \\"WATCH INSTANTLY\\" IF IT DOES NOT PLAY AT ALL!!!! YOU SUCK AMAZON VIDEO!!!
2090338482|4.0|I am studying the language and have found this guide to be a good way to practice French grammar. The sections are well laid out for easy reference and include repetitive exercises. I find the repetition to be good as French grammar is fairly alien to me, and the repetition helps to reinforce what I am learning. Only gave it four stars because I have not gotten through the whole book yet and cannot say for sure that it is the best tool for its purpose. So far, though, seems to be very good. One important note - does not contain the answers. You need to get the answer key book for this (Grammaire Progressive Du Francais Corriges (Answer Key)), available also on Amazon.  Also note, there is an English version of this book available. You may want to consider it as the French one is a bit harder to understand if you are just learning the language. It's really a matter of preference. Préférez-vous?
0446556750|3.0|While I like Micky and think Harry is one of the greatest fictional detectives in the universe, this combined outing was a bit of a tough one to swallow. Harry's third-person sections were the best, capturing the feel of previous book, while Micky's sections sort of fell flat. The story was an interesting one with an antagonist who was well-deserving of the sentence he'd been originally handed down, it was just too uneven to be a consistent read.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|The app wasn't what I had expected.  I had thought this to be a freeform page where you could write, well, freely.  its more structured than that. all that you write, or draw, appears in a structured sentence format.  this makes for nicer looking notes, but it messes up drawings as they are miniaturized to fit into that sentence structure.<br /><br />still, it has been helpful at times, though this isn't the killer app for me in this space.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The Blu-ray I ordered came quickly and it was in the best condition. I bought it used but it looked brand new!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I had seen tons of kids reading the Percy Jackson series, but I was not really into any other book besides Harry Potter. I was reading The Secret Garden when one day Mom decided to take us to the used bookstore. Sure enough, The Lightning Thief was at the store. I heard that these Percy Jackson books were supposed to be really good, so I decided to get it. I absolutely LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so glad I got the book because it took its place as one of my favorite books of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The plot was so well done and it was so fun and interesting to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love Grover, Annabeth, and Percy how they accomplish their quest and figure out who stole Zeus's lightning bolt. Best of all, Percy found Hades's helm of darkness and as a reward, returned Percy's mom to earth. I LOVED the part when Percy battled Ares and when Percy jumped off the building down to the river below to escape from the chimera. This is a great book, I rated it 5 stars because it was so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You should DEFINETLY read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun app! if you have lots of time to waste I recommend this app. hard in some parts, easy and fun in others.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It helps me just be able to read my Bible because to be honest I don't really pick up my Bible often.:( It makes me feel horrible ,but now I'll read it everyday!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game! I use to play it all the time on my computer! It's even better on the kindle fire :)
B0055V6EZE|5.0|We have really enJoyed \\"Let Them Talk\\" CD by Hugh Laurie.  It has that night cluby, New Orleans sound that make your soul feel it's right there with him.  The Bluzy Jazz is just like we want it to be.  Perfect.  I'd definitely reccommend it.
0439023491|5.0|Buy it, read it, I loved it.  The only problem I have now is trying to find another good book to read.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|My two daughters begged me to take them to see this. Afterwards they were cranky and generally not fun to be around. I asked why and they told me, they thought it sucked and how they liked the first one. This movie is simply trying to ride the popularity of the first, and suck as much money out of a substandard project as possible. Don't pay to see this. Borrow it from people who buy it in shame, or use the vast possibilities offered on the internet.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This Bible app has become a huge resource for my daily devotions.  I like the use of accessing the Bible and the plan options. I have learned so much through the studies. Not to mention this app is very user friendly. The only snag would be that often the app freezes while trying to access my plans.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it! It's entertaining with all it's choices. :) I would suggest it to all of my friends! I wish there were more apps like this in the store!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a lot of people say there were to many ads. I didn't really notice or care about them. it only popped up every third game, so not too often. and why would you care anyway?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is hard to put down.  Every available moment I was reading this book on my Kindle. Can't wait to see the movie in March.  It was sad that sleep and work got in my way from reading the book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a  great game. I think it is resly good and the games are realy fun. this game is fun and awesome.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|I can not afford to see Taylor Swift live but have all her groups CD's.  A great live DVD with all her hits. It is my new favorite $20 purchase. And I'm an old guy (52).
B000YI7MRM|2.0|In order to compress half a dozen novels into one film so much is left out that the plot stumbles along disjointedly. Book one alone would have made a good two hour film.  Even the best attempts to condense to a single theatrical release stumble. Think of Das Boot. Sadly, Alatriste is comparable to having series like Harry Potter, Star wars or The Jewel In The Crown reduced to one movie.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This movie blew me away, from the opening (which is the one thing that it seems like everyone on here can agree on) to the final frames. I haven't seen Nicolas Winding Refn's other films, but this makes me want to. His brutal L.A. fairytale earned him a best director at Cannes, and it's not hard to see why. As the title of this review mentions, this movie is not for the lighthearted ryan gosling fan. The violence is intense and not always easy to watch, but it never feels gratuitous. On the contrary, I felt that it added to the hypnotizing feel of the film (but the elevator scene is still tough, credit goes to the sound editors on that one *shudder*).  The movie is called Drive, that being considered, there is a stark lack of \\"driving\\". Admittedly, it was probably not advertized very fairly. To those who take trailers at their face value, it looks like a pg-13, heavy stylized \\"fast and the furious\\" entry. What you're in for is a well acted (especially by Ryan Gosling, Albert Brooks, and Bryan Cranston), violent, art-house tour-de-force. One of the best films of this year, by far.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game I am addicted to it daily. I cant wait to unlock allow the games on it. the game never crashes on me neither.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|The books in this series are the worst I've ever read.  I'll never understand why they have gotten such rave reviews, or why the author is so revered.  All the truly interesting things in the story are largely neglected while the reader is tortured with a never ending stream of barbaric violence, injustice, crude language, and the constant introduction of new characters.  There are no heros. There's nothing you can do but helpless watch as every character you cheer for is brutalized or killed throughout the story.  Given the sheer length of each of these books times 5, it's simply becomes overwhelming. Never has a book pissed me off, but G.R.R. Martin managed to do it to me 5 times in a row. No more. I hear there are supposed to be 2 more books in this grueling series. I won't read them. I couldn't care less how it all ends. I just want my life back.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|this is the first cd i have bought in many years, i only knew two songs when i got it and now i do not even listen to them really now every song on the cd is better than the next. her version of lovesong... fantastic; she never ceases to amaze me. love this cd!! a must buy =) xoxo
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app because it allows me to read my Bible anytime anyplace. It has a lot of useful functions as well.
B004LWZW8S|3.0|Immortals was my first bigscreen viewing of a Tarsem Singh movie and I'll admit on sheer vision I was blown away. I've been a fan of Tarsem since his first film The Cell. His follow-up The Fall was the type of film you get every few years, a massive work that took four years and spanned several continents in its making. Now comes Immortals the first film of His I viewed in theatres and the very vision blew me way.  This film is just a gorgeous feast for the eyes from the opening shot showing the prison of the titans with towering statues of the cell that houses them, to the multiple vistas of small cities or lone structures in the middle of barren deserts. There's no words that can do justice to the vision backed up by an impressive ammount of production value. The late Eiko Ishioka's costumes are beautiful from the giant in a barbed wire minotaur helmet to the costumes of the gods themselves each individually garish and beautiful at the same time. The action is fantastic and well shot and the film is astounding to watch. And the action while nothing astounding is well shot and suitably bloody (watch a scene where Ares smashes the heads of five villains). Its all fun to me.  Which is why the hours after viewing the movie is when the disappointment sets in. For all of the vision on display the plot itself feels a bit nonsensical at times with set pieces thrown in that look great (Poseidon's tsunami dive is amamzing but why did Theseus and his companions actually go to sea when they easily make the trip overland afterwards). The characters are sketchy at best with at least Henry Cavill providing and decent hero as Theseus while  Mickey Rourke is a decent villain. Others aren't so well drawn with Frida Pinto continuing to be pretty face without any real depth as an actress and Stephen Dorff as the plucky sidekick. The motivations of Luke Evan's Zeus are confounding and I'm sure I missed the reason there seemed to be only about six gods on Olymphus. The story hurts a fun movie and really leaves me wishing Tarsem had thrown caution to the wind shot the film with more flare towards the garish and surreal.  In the end while the film isn't great its the kind of pop entertainment I'll grudgingly admit is kind of a guilty pleasure for me.
0345529057|5.0|Started reading the books because everyone was talking about them. Great series! This package is a great price for a great read!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Really enjoy this app. It has a rather calming effect. I could waste a lot of time tinkering with this app.
B006PAZMMK|4.0|I am not going to specifically address any of the criticisms you will find among the negative reviews here; if you don't get it, that's fine. I don't think any less of you for it. But if you have good speakers and a pelvis to thrust, Skrillex gives you something to appreciate. The track \\"Kyoto\\" in particular makes me want to freak on your grandmother.<br /><br />So ignore the hype, ignore the naysayers, turn up the volume, and clear the area immediately in front of you. And if your grandma doesn't answer the next time you call, it's because we can't hear the phone over the music.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is my first review but I feel compelled to write one!  Very fun trying to unlock all the games!  A must download!
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love the protective leather cover I purchased for my Kindle Fire!! It is a quality case to make my awesome Kindle look and feel great!!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this app is amazing and free for one day it doesn't look like much but its awesome wish it was a live wallpaper looks great on kindly fire get it!! !
1612930727|3.0|I really like the content of the book but kept getting tripped up on the misspelled words...and there are tons of them!  I wrote my first book a few years back and had my editor go over it with a fine tooth comb.  If you can get past being rattled by this kind of imperfection (and I do live in an imperfect world so why worry)I know you will find the stories Joseph Murphy is sharing to be enlightening and promising for those who need a refresher or if you've just set out on a new path of exploring being a spiritual being having a human experience.  p.s.  I tried contacting the publisher of this book but they are out of business...surprise!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great and addicting in my opinion. would recommend this game for anyone to play while being bored and having nothing to do.
B006Y5BWQG|3.0|After watching this twice to give it a really fair shake, I find myself thinking this is more the stuff of a movie, than a television series.  The casting is pretty amazing, I will agree, and the characters are interesting enough.  And yet, there are two main things that I can't seem to get past:  1.  there is really no villain, or character that causes tension in the \\"I gotta watch this person get their bad karma back\\" kind of way (more on this expanded below) and 2. I cannot believe in the premise that a total green unknown singer would or could be considered for the lead in a production of this magnitude (meaning the character of Karen Cartwright, played by Katharine McPhee)...chorus, yes...maybe the understudy, yes...but the lead??  Expand on point #1:  No villain:  Well, I guess you could call the \\"director\\" Derek Wills (played by Jack Davenport) a sort of not-so-nicey character...though he seems to just be playing the predictable part of the semi-sleazy, semi-sexy hetero director who uses the casting couch to fill his lonely nights in his huge gorgeous apartment.  Starlet #1 (with a good resume), Ivy Lynn (played by a VERY talented Megan Hilty), seems to fall prey to his English charms, though practically perfect and very green wannabe Starlet Karen Cartwright tiptoes up the edge of sin, and then gets the heck out of there because she has a perfectly supportive and loving boyfriend (played nicely by Raza Jaffrey).  No real tension there.  The only other tension might be the upcoming baby-adopting drama between Playwright Julia Houston (Debra Messing is always a pleasure to watch) and her husband Frank (played without much spark by Brian d'Arcy James)...but I don't find this story all that engaging.  Then there is the predictably bitter divorce between Broadway heavyweights Eileen Rand (Angelica Huston is a favorite of mine) and her cheating no-good soon-to-be ex Jerry (played by Michael Cristofer)...yawn.  If the only real tension we have is the battle for thelead, and both of the characters are fairly sympathetic, well, like a said, a movie...not an ongoing television show.  Point #2:  Really?  Karen Cartwright has the chops to steal the lead from triple threat Ivy??  I don't buy it.  I know that the following episodes will show Karen \\"working really hard\\", but she is just too lightweight to carry such a large and flashy production.  The very iffy nature of funding a Broadway production (especially when your producer Eileen Rand has an ex who is playing \\"hide the cash\\") is just not the place that could even consider casting her (realistically) even if her voice is lovely and she raises her arms in a vulnerable \\"Marilyn\\"-type way when she is singing.  Can she belt it out (we are certain that Ivy can); Can she dance (we are mesmerized when Ivy does); can she act (the jury is still out for both Karen, and her real-life counterpart Katharine McPhee)?  I guess I just don't buy it that she would even be considered for the lead...they would place her in the chorus, maybe give her the understudy.  So if I don't buy it, well then the main thrust of the plot seems to lose it's effectiveness and plausibility.  Things I like:  LOVE LOVE LOVE the songs that the writing team has come up with for the \\"Marilyn\\" production...very clever and believable in a Broadway type way.  I like to see the Times Square tracking shots, but in a weekly tv show these kinds of location shots become too expensive and burdomsome to keep up for multiple episodes, let alone seasons...maybe just a little \\"sizzle\\" in the pilot?  The pacing was all right, and I liked the flash-forward fantasy during the rehearsals for the show numbers...since that is the only thing that brought it \\"to life\\".  What I will do with this show:  I feel like they have already laid out for me (in the promo that followed the episode) just what will happen....Ivy sleeps with director and then runs off in a huff after not getting the part, Julia will be tempted from some hottie in herpast that joins the production, Karen works hard to become Marilyn and learns to dance (uh, she should already know this cold) and there is probably some other Starlet that will upend Ivy and Karen's dream chance (Uma Thurman?). I don't see any surprises that I am motivated to watch live for.  This show is pretty to look at (and listen to), but without any real tension, or surprising sexy twists...I can easily DVR this and watch it the next day.  Until I am bored with it.  Maybe 3 episodes.  \\"Castle\\" on ABC still owns my heart at 10pm Mondays; now that is sexy tension galore!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app id a great way to pass time when that is what is required.  it is worth the download.  I use it often.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Exactly what I thought it was gonna be.  Fun challenging games, and a wide variety of them. I'll be playing this forever, and you should too!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Excellent product! Lots of games and plenty of fun for the entire family.I recommend this product to anyone who enjoy playing games.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I am a husband and a father of a 5 mo. yr old boy, and this film inspires me to be the very best man I can be. My wife and I saw it when it was in theatres, and we bought it on DVD so we can keep it and watch it again as a family. I am a big fan of all the films from the Kendrick bro's, from their very first film Flywheel (a must see if you haven't seen it yet, such a great story) to Facing the Giants, Fireproof, and now Courageous. What impacts me is the stories and their development, they are all very real life, and Courageous hits right at home, quite literally.  As a new dad, I struggle to know what kind of father I should be, especially because my father was not there for me when I needed him. I don't have any other model, other than my Father in Heaven. Courageous gives me a brief, but much needed picture of what a godly father looks like and can be in the lives of his family, and the godly principles that define such a man. A must see for any dad, and definitely a film to watch with the whole family together.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The Deathly Hollows Part 2 is the best of the series.  I hate to see the end of the story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is absolutely positively wonderful. something for everyone to enjoy.  not hard yet not easy either.  hours of entertainment await you with this
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie is really utter rubbish, it's cliche, so similar to the first one, no thing original really utter rubbish, DONT'T WATCH IT, save your time save your money.

0316056863|5.0|Wanta' laugh? READ THIS BOOK! Tina Fey is so honest - and so funny - that you will do best to read this book in a place - like the beach with a crashing ocean nearby - so you will avoid annoying everyone around you with your continuous, loud, belly-aching laughter. She certainly \\"tells it like it is\\" being totally honest about everything she has experienced: growing up, as an adolescent, as a comedy writer, as a harried mother while being on a top-rated TV show. You gotta' love the gal for sure. And appreciate her TOTAL honesty. Man. She doesn't pull her punches...EVER. No wonder she is such a great comedy writer, and show-stopper!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a lot of fun to play.  Like to play when I have a few extra minutes.  Have choices of what types of games you would like to play which is a nice feature.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />\\"The Lion King,\\" The Walt Disney Company's 1994 animated release, is the crescendo to Disney's creative burst to open the decade.  It is undoubtedly a classic film in the genre, and features an all-star voiceover cast including James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Jeremy Irons.<br /><br />The movie is still striking, its rich animation immediately evident in the opening frames, a sunrise over the African landscape.  The marriage of music and imagery is very moving, as the wise primate Rafiki offers up the infant Simba to the acclaim and reverence of the animals as \\"Circle of Life\\" plays.  Rafiki is offering Simba to his life and future as king of the beasts.  But, first, Simba must be a cub learning at the feet of his loving father Mufasa, indelibly voiced by James Earl Jones.  The extent of his malice blissfully unknown to both of them, Mufasa's brother and Simba's uncle Scar plots a monumental killing that will drive Simba away from his pride.<br /><br />Also featuring the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Johnathan Taylor Thomas, as well a very good bestselling soundtrack, Walt Disney's \\"The Lion King\\" remains a powerful animated film.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|went through the game once with no problems and now on the second go it freezes up within a couple minutes of starting a level in the main story mode.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|waste time when you are bored. can spend hours playing all the games that are in this game. awesome game
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I love this app,it is really fun and cool especially if you are bored.I get mesmerized by this app :)
B0053VKP8S|4.0|Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the power cord is so darn short.  Nothing could be an easier and cheaper solution for connecting digial audio output from panel TV to an analog stereo receiver to overcome their tinny, rear-facing  speakers. The FiiO D3 works as advertised. I'm converting Optical output from a Samsung pn51d550 ... hope it lasts.  Enjoy!
B006E4QCXU|3.0|hey y'all dis ya boy nuknuk a.k.a lil rich boy this  is some awsome game you can play u can change the stern settings. and all that all Leicester a.k.a lil rich boy
B000A1SZ2Y|3.0|For the price, you can't really complain too much. However, the vignette that results around the image is rather annoying.
B000K4UF4C|5.0|While I haven't heard as many performances as the other reviewer, I have heard many. This one is just fantastic. The technique is perfection itself--each note clear, even; each phrase shaped. He doesn't bury the lead, the way some pianists do; and he has enough feeling to make you feel the music. The orchestra is sharp and with him all the way; the sound well balanced. At the very least I put this up there at the top with Horowitz and Argerich, if not ahead of them.
0439023521|1.0|It's been said by previous reviewers, and probably in better words, but I'ma say it again.<br /><br />The first book is super fast-paced and an easy - and engaging - read. But I think it's bad literature.<br /><br />The setting of a dystopian society wherein children are pitted against one another to the death in an annual melee ABSOLUTELY BEGS for a strong moral message. A message of humanity, hope, compassion, the darkness AND the lightness in each person, forgiveness, sacrifice, redemption... And the call is completely unanswered. There is no moral message that comes through, not for the characters and not for the readers.<br /><br />I read and read, waiting for the characters to develop, to come to understandings, to break through and open up and help us, the readers, realize along with them that even if things are bleak and wretched there can be hope, we can still maintain our dignity and humanity and compassion.  We can learn from our mistakes. We can be the better person. We can overcome.<br /><br />Nope! Suzanne Collins instead makes the reader part of the audience to a sad and violent reality show where we're super excited and horrified to see who's gunna git killed next. The story is dark and depressing and shallow. Aaaand poorly written.<br /><br />The crazy-hard moral dilemma of our would-be heroine Katniss - in which she must kill or be killed - should REALLY bring out some character-building, impossibly complex ethical predicaments, right? Again, no. When Katniss kills another child in the arena, we always feel that he really deserved it. He was an a-hole. He was dangerous.  We all love us some good old fashioned black-and-white characters. Bad guys are always easy to kill. When Katniss begins to like one of her opponents and frets over the \\"one of us is going to have to kill the other\\" situation, the other character is killed off by one of the bad guys. Whew. Glad we didn't have to face that one. How frickin' convenient. And how horribly shallow and irresponsible. Instead of really digging into the obvious issue of \\"Dude, these are a bunch of kids fighting to the death for an audience and that's super horrible\\", Collins makes the fighting itself the focus and intrigue, rather than a platform from which to tackle real, deep issues.<br /><br />Ugh. I just wanted these books to be so much more. But they weren't.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This is a memo from Jeremy Shingles on behalf of MICHAELmATICIAN. We are in no way endorsing the purchase of said DVD, but merely offering an opinion of the film. You may acquire the DVD as you please and where you wish. This information must not be disclosed to any outside parties. Let us begin:<br /><br />1. Daniel Day Lewis - This actor never ceases to amaze us viewers. His performance alone is enough reason to view the film.<br /><br />2. P.T. Anderson - This director presents a film so haunting and serious that it recalls the work of Kubrick and Welles in its aesthetic. This film is possibly his best work.<br /><br />3. Jonny Greenwood - This composer provides amazing music that certainly enhances the film. It was a smart choice by Anderson. Greenwood's contributions are enough reason to view the film.<br /><br />4. Greed - This deadly sin is one of the greatest motivations for Lewis' character in this film. It is portrayed in a much different way than Michael Douglas did it in \\"Wall Street\\". Day Lewis was the man for the job in this particular case.<br /><br />5. Daniel Plainview - This main character will soon become a timeless classic, to be mentioned with the best of them. He is sort of a Villian's Hero, doing good for the worst of us. He really succeeds at his goals, which are less than noble.<br /><br />6. Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) - This supporting character is one of the best parts of the film. As frantic and crazed as any great Crispin Glover role, Eli Sunday is simply amazing. He is the leader of the Church of the 3rd Revelation!<br /><br />7. Oil! - This screenplay is adapted from the book Oil! and is epic. From the story to the dialog, not a minute is disposable in this film.<br /><br />8. Hate - This emotion is the other great motivation for the main character. It is the center of much of the plot developments as well as the greatest quotes from the film. \\"I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people. I don't have to look past seeing them to get all that I need.\\"<br /><br />This film must be viewed. It will be viewed.<br /><br />2.342be viewed.  2.342
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|this kindle cover is perfect for someone looking for a simple case.  the fire fits snuggly inside, and the stand is very stable. first thing i did when it arrived was to put it in stand-mode and type a little test note. it stayed upright throughout. someone should have no trouble taking notes or watching movies. that being said, if you press on the kindle from the opposite side, then the case will fall down, but then again it is not designed to be pressed on that way. i have not been disappointed yet. take that for what you will.  thanks.
B001LF4ARC|5.0|This book along with \\"Inside Apple\\" by Adam Lashinsky are the best books about Apple Computer Inc. I have found. The two books together will give you the best look inside the company and Steve Jobs that I have yet to find.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Amazing buy, I wish i bought these originally, as these would have been my normal use headphones for my computer instead of the dre beats! the sound is very very good especially for the price. I'm not an audiophile but I know a good sound when i hear one. Don't pass these ones up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love how fun the games are and how its not impossible to earn points to unlock new games :) keeps me busy for hours and I like the pages they promote I found many new apps through this game.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I really like this type of game and this game was really good. I think it was worth the money.
B001O7JHSE|4.0|This is an excellent movie - not because of the hate, racism, and prejudice, but because of the exact opposite. With a stellar performance from Edward Norton, we get to see a positive change in learned human nature through a trying personal experience. After killing two black men, Derek Vinyard goes to prison for manslaughter as a bigot and a man with hatred towards anybody but the white population. Through his experience and interaction with a certain black man in prison, he quickly realizes that he is the minority there, and he is released from prison as a new man. This movie will give you goosebumps to see the transformation of Derek Vinyard and how it impacts his brother Danny, how they learn to accept others, and let go of the hate and anger in their hearts. It is difficult to face that people treat others this way in real life. Through this movie, it is interesting to see the different points of view regarding this issue. Highly recommended.
B005K17RU0|5.0|ive used a few different weather apps and Imo its the simplest most easy to use app for any android system
0439023521|5.0|Except that my daughter (who is an adult and quite pushy when she puts her mind to it) harrassed, nagged, and generally made a pain in the butt of herself until I agreed to read it. She reminded me of how I had harrassed, nagged, and made a pain of myself in order to get her to read The Stand by Stephen King. In both cases, we found ourselves enchanted, albiet reluctantly. While technically a book for young adults, the themes here are universal, without being preachy. The writer's touch is deft and subtle, and her characters demand the focus rather than their circumstances. Their situation is horrific, but somehow you walk away thinking more of the characters than the world they inhabit. That's rare...and I liked it. Damn it.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|best weather app.  I love the weather clock, great looking and easy to read.  The forecast page gives all the info you need on one screen.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is a fast pace game. It is lots of fun to play. I highly recommend it. You can play three different types of modes. Arcade is my favorite.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|I thought it was going to be spectacular,  but it wasn't. dots.  just dragging dots around. Maybe I just have a higher wow factor than some.
B006B3975Y|5.0|This whole album is amazing!  It flows seamlessly. I just got it and I'm really feeling \\"Make My\\" and \\"Sleep\\".....just the whole thing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Works great on this phone and is a lot of fun.  The music is nice, too.  A good game for adults.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|THEY SHOULD PAY US AT LEAST $10000 TO WATCH THIS! I WISH I COULD RATE THIS 0 STARS! IT IS TORTURE!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Would rather have holes drilled through my head than watch this terrible movie again. Do yourself a favour and don't watch this unless you enjoy torture.
0545265355|3.0|I read the entire series in a week.  Considering that I'm a college sophomore who also happens to be an English major, this wasn't a difficult feat.  Especially since this was one of the most captivating, enthralling series I have ever read.  The plot line is fantastic.  Many people have serious complaints considering the second book's return to the Hunger Games.  However, it makes logical sense.  The leaders who created the Quarter Quell WOULD include this challenge.  And if the Katniss had not gone back in, she never would have been recruited by District 13.  But there are some gaping holes.  First, the character development is awful.  I cannot think of a single character, excepting perhaps for Peeta, who was any type of dynamic.  Even though this series is written in first person point of view, Katniss NEVER changes.  She never has a problem with simply being a figurehead for the rebellion and manipulated by the camera crews/District 13.  She has no logical reasoning for assassinating Coin.  And she never, NEVER believes in the rebellion itself, that the world can actually be changed for the better.  Isn't that the whole point for the leader/figurehead of a cause?  To believe in it?  Of course, she would be completely susceptible to PTSD, but if she had believed in the cause itself, she never would have been as manically depressed as she was, wouldn't have been content with being shipped to District 12 at the end, to spend the rest of her days withdrawn from the politics of the new government she helped establish.  Secondly, the ending of the series.  Just as Katniss is reaching the President, just as the climax commences, our heroine is hit by a bomb.  And her sister Prim, the entire reason why Katniss has been fighting, unnecessarily dies.  The entire falling action is horrendous and seemingly thrown together, as though the author didn't feel like writing out an extra 100 pages for a good/closure-ridden ending.  Collins NEEDED extra pages.  All the loose ends are tied up, sure, but in too rapid a pace, like she was rushing just to finish the novel.  Katniss killing Coin, drudging about her home in District 12 for months, finally falling in love with Peeta...it all happens too quickly, doesn't give the readers the closure they deserve.  For three books, we have been waiting to discover how the rebellion would end, where Katniss would end up--and especially who with.  And it's suddenly over in twenty quick pages.  Third, the epilogue.  Unnecessary as well.  Very cliched.  Truly not much to elaborate on.  And yet I give this series three stars.  Because it did have me on the edge of my seat, ignoring homework, dying with anticipation for an entire week.  Though the ending was a let down, though the heroine was the epitome of static and a nonbeliever, though the love triangle of the three books is brought to a too-rapid close, I want to buy the series.  This series has an amazing concept, one that has been untried before, and is not too inappropriate yet just gory enough for middle school through adulthood.  I recommend it.
B005KELQEU|5.0|There are several reviews saying that this case does not fit the Kindle Touch.  I received this item and at first the Kindle Touch was a pretty tight fit, but after having the device in the case for a week or so, it now fits just fine.  Haven't had any problems with the case turning the Kindle on and the case works well and I feel that were I to drop the case that there would be a decent level of protection.  TL;DR:  leave the kindle touch in the case for a few days, it stretches out.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|love this game it is a blast and a good way to past some time you need to try it out
B001661RC2|4.0|smooth, articulate and bluesy. Yuppppp thas how I would describe this album. A&R is my first foray into the indy rock/blues style of the Black Keys. Danger Mouse who I've respected since the Grey album shows me another side of his multi faceted sound, he executively produced this album and his infliction of synths and drums really make this album pop...A&R gave me a reason to go and purchase almost half of The Black Keys catalog and I hope to only hear more from them in the future.
B005OOSPZO|3.0|Have a playback issue with this disk. The Japaneese dialogue is done in Japaneese with english sub titles. And subtitles are displayed underneath, not part of, the picture. I'm fine with all that. But in watching those scenes I could not get my player to show more than the first line of the subtitled dialogue thereby missing anything beyond that first line. Finally gave up because couldn't tell what was going on. Otherwise great looking disk.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I couldn't love this movie more!  It is truly a work of art. It is a quiet, intense and visually stunning masterpiece.  If you are looking for your typical action \\"chase\\" movie, move along, this is not for you.  If you are looking for a sophisticated film noir with stellar acting, an amazing soundtrack, and absolutely beautiful \\"pictures,\\" this is it!
0345404475|5.0|This book was a phenominal read, was very fast paced and had one of the most fascinating hard sci-fi plots that I have found so far.  Obviously as most know this book is the inspiration for the movie BladeRunner.  However, I found it even more akin to the anime Ghost in the Shell.  The novel follows a bounty hunter who is assigned to hunt rogue androids who have escaped Mars and who have come to earth.  These androids are especially dangerous because they are able to acts and look completely human and they are completly indistingushable.  The only thing that is able to tell them apart is a test that measures the level of emapthy that they have, a process which is slowly dying out due to a more advanced computer \\"brain\\" called the Nexus 6.  With this brain the androids are able to fool the test with uploaded false memories.  The main character is contracted to kill 6 of the most dangerous ones on earth after one of them nearly killed a friend of his.  The rest of the book delves into the moral aspect of \\"mind-machine interface\\" and disputes whether or not a human can feel empathy for a robot.  There are interesting comentaires on human emotion and on how human emotion is beinging increasingly fabricated in the digital age.  This book is a phenominal read and is very deep on the philisophical level.  I definatly recommend reading this one.  After rading it definatly check out \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" and compare for yourself how similar they are in the social commentaries that they make.  Any fan of hard sci-fi or dystopic novels will love this one.  It should be noted that some are saying that this novel is a rehash of the original and is not the original version.  I am unsure as to whether or not this is true or not.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|first and foremost let me start off by saying this price for this box of movie gold was too good to pass up. All three Matrix movies the very much slept on Animatrix and 2 DVD's based on the philosophy of the Matrix. I never watch the special included discs but this box set was so good I wanted more after watching everything.  Video transfer onto Blu-Ray at 1080P is amazing..crystal clear, detailed and very much the definition of HD. Audio is coded in Dolby TRUE HD and sounds magnificent on my home theater rig.  Buy this as a gift or for your personal collection..it will not disappoint.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|It is one of the best games for the fire that I've played and is definitely reminiscent of myst and riven, although its not nearly as long or as challenging.  Five stars for 2.00
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|rubbish movie, waste of time dont buy it.  why this movie was made is beyond me but these movie producers are losing their touch with movies.  absolutely bland, boring and just a pointless movie.  wanna see penguins? go to the aquarium or zoo
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the most accurate weather app around. Even when I am looking two weeks ahead, its almost always accurate.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|I cant even look at it it hurts my eyes really bad. but its is an ok game besides the eye hurting if you have nothing better to do
B0063IH60K|4.0|I thought this was a perfect. app for rainy days. It had no problems with sound nor image so far good app!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This LEGO set is the best one I have ever set eyes on. I am 11 and started to save up the money for this set about a 1/2 a year ago and than got it for Christmas. When I picked it up I was amazed at how heavy it was. Later, when I opened the box, 4 boxes that a $100 dollar LEGO set would go in fell out. 1 was labed 1, another 2, than 3, and 4. I picked up the box with a one on it and ripped it open. After I finished up most of the pieces, I dumped box two on the table. After most of those pieces were gone I did 3, and then did the same with 4. Before I was done building, my sister Ana and I were already playing with it. It is an amazing set! Also it has a lot of moving gadgets. It has two elevators, a hole that is in the prision cell gate that leads to the garbage compactor that opens and closes, the tractor beam that shuts off, the laser is movable, the garbage compactor closes by a button, guns that move without touching them, a  gun that actually fires, and more. I think this set is worth way more than $400 dollars, and is a must have.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|Just downloaded this for my Kindle Fire (after trying and liking the free version) but feel a little cheated because of one tiny snag. My first ball on every game sticks and stalls in midair -- once I touch it again, it goes on down the lane and the game plays normally after that. It happens every time and I even tried to reinstall but it didn't help. Would have rated four stars otherwise...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible app. No matter where I am, I can look up scripture. I love all the different reading plans that you can set up &amp; it keeps track for you.  I also love all the different versions, that you can choose from, to read.
B005URRCUY|4.0|I think Black Key´s best album to date is Attack and Release (2008). El Camino comes next, as their second best album - catchier and irresistibly gaudy! It's not funny when the whole world knows your \\"secret favorite band\\" but these guys really deserve it. You must listen to this record.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This application exceeded all of my expectations.  I have reccomended it to all my friends.  I do wish it was available like the books , but otherwise what a awesome application.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This app is very frustrating!  As you advance levels in the middle of your game it will just stop and you get sent to home on your phone.  I don't know if it just my phone (Galaxy S) or just the game.  Annoying! I only put up with it because it was a free app from Amazon, I would be super annoyed if I paid for it!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I have played other games like this before... but none that were this fluid and beautiful. on the technical side, the physics are brilliant. and on the art side, the graphics are beautiful and as smooth as butter. definitely would recomend this game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|excellent bible study. wish I could access offline when out of internet range. Otherwise it is excellent and pleased to have it on my tablet. Would recommend to all.

B004QK5N5W|5.0|This HDMI adapter works great! Unfortunately, it does not support my IPOD Touch 3, but it works fantastic on my iPhone 4.  I do have issues with Netflix: anytime I exit Netflix (whether from power-saver, switching apps, etc) and go back to Netflix, the controls sometimes appear on my TV screen, or are completely missing.  The work-arounds I use are: (1)kill the Netflix app from the background tasks and restart fresh, or (2) unplug the HDMI cable from the iPhone then plug it back in.
0307455378|5.0|I wasn't looking for a brand new book, just something in good condition so that I could mark up the pages myself.  The seller of this item sold it to me under the presumption that it was a used book, but in good condition.  This was highly underestimated; when I received the book, it looked like it was brand new! I am extremely happy with this purchase and shall I purchase another book through Amazon, I will be looking up this particular seller :)

B004U52VPS|5.0|My son wanted this for Christmas but we weren't able to get it in time so he bought it with his only allowance. Both my 7 and 3 year-old boys enjoy playing this with their Dad. Many nights we spend building and destroying the angrybirds set-up.
B005K01VZS|3.0|To be honest, I did not know what to expect when I first read the reviews and purchased this book on amazon. I was a little disappointed when the actual book arrived, for it is around 225 pages... but those pages are cut down in size to about half the size of a regular book.  If you're looking for heartwarming stories on the veracity of two religious leaders' faiths, then this is the book for you. If you're looking for spiritual truth, regardless of your religion, this \\"little\\" book will have some great insight, but keep in mind the summation of that insight could fit into about 2 or 3 of the mini pages. That being said, it is not that I didn't like the book; it is just that all the book is is simply nice. By the end, I couldn't knock the strong sense that Mitch Albom is the secular writer who is willing to \\"stoop down\\" to the level of the average American's intellect in order to declare that having some faith, as long as it's tolerant, can be a good thing. We get the vibe that, though the Rabbi and Minister's faiths are both genuine, Mr. Albom is the forensic agnostic who is willing to \\"courageously\\" assert that having a faith in a secular world is okay. While the Minister and the Rabbi both have belief in God, we don't get a sense that the author has any, and it is that feeling that is discomforting.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|I saw the first Hangover and it was really funny. This one was pretty good, but didn't seem as funny as the first one. It WAS funny, but I think I liked the first one more. The story line was entertaining and the movie was worth seeing. When it comes to movies, I generally have low expectations and never get caught up in analyzing plots, characters, etc. If it's entertaining, I'll finish the movie ... regardless of whether or not the film has a \\"meaningful plot\\" or \\"complex characters\\". I recommend this movie for a good laugh.

0446541478|5.0|Thanks to an opportunity I got to meet with the Israel Chief Scientist, and the fact I was offered Start-Up Nation at the end of the meeting, let me give you my views on this very interesting book. But first a few things about Israel and innovation.<br /><br />Israel is an innovation superpower. Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, Novartis, Nestle and many others are located there. Check Point is just one of the many start-up success stories. Israel has more start-ups quoted on Nasdaq than Europe and venture capital is very active there. Finally the office of the chief scientist manages and funds the public side of innovation in Israel. All this is perfectly analyzed in the book Start-Up Nation that I have just read.<br /><br />I thought I knew a lot about Israel, but the book is rich in anecdotes. The history of Israel is well described and innovation was probably a necessity to survive. If there is a point I appreciated less is the importance the authors give to the military. They may be right, that's not the point, but I thought the topic came too often in the chapters. This remains a great book and a must read for anyone interested in high-tech innovation and entrepreneurship. I'd like now to quote a few things I liked. It's not structured at all, but I invite you to read the book!<br /><br />From the Introduction<br /><br />Google's CEO and chairman, Eric Schmidt said  that the United States is the number one place in the world for entrepreneurs, but \\"after the U.S., Israel is the best.\\" Microsoft's Steve Ballmer has called Microsoft \\"an Israeli company as much as an American company\\" because of the size and centrality of its Israeli teams.\\"<br /><br />The authors begin by explaining that adversity and multidimensionality as much as the talent of individuals, are critical:  \\"it is a story not just of talent but of tenacity, of insatiable questioning of authority, of determined informality, combined with a unique attitude toward failure, teamwork, mission, risk, and cross-disciplinary creativity.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 1- Persistence<br /><br />The usual joke Americans need to put, but it is a good one!<br />Four guys are standing on a street corner . . .<br />an American, a Russian, a Chinese man, and an Israeli. . . .<br />A reporter comes up to the group and says to them:<br />\\"Excuse me. . . . What's your opinion on the meat shortage?\\"<br />The American says: What's a shortage?<br />The Russian says: What's meat?<br />The Chinese man says: What's an opinion?<br />The Israeli says: What's \\"Excuse me\\"?<br />--MIKE LEIGH, Two Thousand Years<br /><br />- No inhibition about challenging the logic behind the way things have been done for years.<br />- A rude, aggressive culture which tolerates failure.<br />- Israeli attitude and informality flow also from a cultural tolerance for what some Israelis call \\"constructive failures\\" or \\"intelligent failures.\\"<br />- It is critical to distinguish between \\"a well-planned experiment and a roulette wheel<br />(During the meeting with the chief scientist, there was a similar argument: \\"if we have a 5% success rate, we'd better give the responsability to donkeys to choose and if it is 70% success rate, we do not take enough risks\\")<br />- Amos Oz talks about \\"a culture of doubt and argument, an open-ended game of interpretations, counter-interpretations, reinterpretations, opposing interpretations. From the very beginning of the existence of the Jewish civilization, it was recognized by its argumentativeness.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 2- Lesson from the military<br /><br />- Narrow hierarchy and autonomy gives a lot of responsibility to individuals, authority is discussed<br />- People are mature earlier.<br />- No need to wait for order to act.<br />- \\"The key for leadership is the soldiers' confidence in their commander. If you don't trust him, if you're not confident in him, you can't follow him.\\"<br />- \\"If you aren't even aware that the people in the organization disagree with you, then you are in trouble\\"<br /><br />- \\"Real experience also typically comes with age or maturity. But in Israel, you get experience, perspective, and maturity at a younger age, because the society jams so many transformative experiences into Israelis when they're barely out of high school. By the time they get to college, their heads are in a different place than those of their American counterparts.\\"... \\"The notion that one should accumulate credentials before launching a venture simply does not exist.\\"<br /><br />A dense network - the whole country is one degree of separation (Yossi Vardi)<br /><br />Chapter 5- Order and chaos<br /><br />- Singapore's leaders have failed to keep up in a world that puts a high premium on a trio of attributes historically alien to Singapore's culture: initiative, risk-taking, and agility; in addition to being real experts who can improvise in situations of crisis.<br />- Innovation is fundamentally an experimental endeavor (improvisation over discipline)<br />- Learn from mistake with no fear of losing face.<br />- Nobody learns from someone who is being self defensive<br />- Fluidity, according to a new school of economists studying key ingredients for entrepreneurialism, is produced when people can cross boundaries, turn societal norms upside down, and agitate in a free-market economy, all to catalyze radical ideas.<br /><br />Chapter 7 - Immigration<br /><br />Immigrants are not averse to starting over. They are, by definition, risk takers. A nation of immigrants is a nation of entrepreneurs.--GIDI GRINSTEIN<br /><br />Sergey Brin spoke in an Israeli high school: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys,\\" he said in Russian, his choice of language prompting spontaneous applause. \\"I emigrated from Russia when I was six,\\" Brin continued. \\"I went to the United States. Similar to you, I have standard Russian-Jewish parents. My dad is a math professor. They have a certain attitude about studies. And I think I can relate that here, because I was told that your school recently got seven out of the top ten places in a math competition throughout all Israel.\\" This time the students clapped for their own achievement. \\"But what I have to say,\\" Brin continued, cutting through the applause, \\"is what my father would say--`What about the other three?<br /><br />The authors mention the seminal work of AnnaLee Saxenian (Regional advantage, the New Argonauts). As a few examples of Israel tech. diaspora mentioned in the book:<br />- Dov Frohman - Intel - 1974 -  Wikipedia link. Apparently Israel has been the core of Intel innovation in the past decade and Intel is the largest private employer in Israel.<br />- Michael Laor - Cisco - 1997 -  Linkedin profile. Cisco has acquired 9 israeli start-ups since Laor came back (more acquisitions than in any other country except the USA)<br />- Yoelle Maarek - Google - [...]<br /><br />But one should not forget Mirabilis/ICQ (see below)  or Check Point. Check Point was established in 1993, by the company's current Chairman & CEO Gil Shwed, [...].<br /><br />Chapter 9 - Yozma<br /><br />Another member of the tech. diaspora: Orna Berry - PhD USC - Unisys-IBM then Ornet and Gemini then OCS chief... The VC industry was really launched through the Yozma effort as well as Israeli incubators. Gemini was the first Israel fund. See the wikipedia article about venture capital in Israel.<br /><br />Another quote on start-ups vs. more mature industries: \\"In aerospace, you can't be an entrepreneur,\\" he explained. \\"The government owns the industry, and the projects are huge. But I learned a lot of technical things there that helped me immensely later on.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 12 - Transdisciplinarity<br /><br />\\"There's a multitask mentality here.\\" The multitasking mentality produces an environment in which job titles--and the compartmentalization that goes along with them--don't mean much.<br />- \\"Combining mathematics, biology, computer science, and organic chemistry at Compugen\\"<br />- \\"Putting this together required an unorthodox combination of engineering skills.\\"<br /><br />The term in the United States for this kind of crossover is a mashup. And the term itself has been rapidly morphing and acquiring new meanings. ... An even more powerful mashup, in our view, is when innovation is born from the combination of radically different technologies and disciplines. The companies where mashups are most common in Israel are in the medical-device and biotech sectors, where you find wind tunnel engineers and doctors collaborating on a credit card-sized device.<br /><br />But the authors do not forget to mention that Israel is A country with a motive<br /><br />Role models<br /><br />Though Israel was already well into its high-tech swing by then, the ICQ sale was a national phenomenon. It inspired many more Israelis to become entrepreneurs. The founders, after all, were a group of young hippies. Exhibiting the common Israeli response to all forms of success, many figured, If these guys did it, I can do it better. Further, the sale was a source of national pride, like winning a gold medal in the world's technology Olympics.<br /><br />\\"There's a legitimate way to make a profit because you're inventing something,\\" says Erel Margalit \\"You talk about a way of life--not necessarily about how much money you're going to make, though it's obviously also about that.\\"<br /><br />\\"Indeed, what makes the current Israeli blend so powerful is that it is a mashup of the founders' patriotism, drive, and constant consciousness of scarcity and adversity and the curiosity and restlessness that have deep roots in Israeli and Jewish history. \\"The greatest contribution of the Jewish people in history is dissatisfaction,\\" Peres explained.<br /><br />Again \\"Not just talent, but tenacity, insatiable questioning of authority, determined informality, unique attitude toward failure, teamwork, mission, risk and cross-disciplinary creativity.\\"<br /><br />As a conclusion<br /><br />\\"So what is the answer to the central question of this book: What makes Israel so innovative and entrepreneurial? The most obvious explanation lies in a classic cluster of the type Harvard professor Michael Porter has championed, Silicon Valley embodies. It consists of the tight proximity of great universities, large companies, start-ups, and the ecosystem that connects them--including everything from suppliers, an engineering talent pool, and venture capital. Part of this more visible part of the cluster is the role of the military in pumping R&D funds into cutting-edge systems and elite technological units, and the spillover from this substantial investment, both in technologies and human resources, into the civilian economy. ... But this outside layer does not fully explain Israel's success. Singapore has a strong educational system. Korea has conscription and has been facing a massive security threat for its entire existence. Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Ireland are relatively small countries with advanced technology and excellent infrastructure; they have produced lots of patents and reaped robust economic growth. Some of these countries have grown faster for longer than Israel has and enjoy higher standards of living, but none of them have produced anywhere near the number of start-ups or have attracted similarly high levels of venture capital investments. What's missing in these other countries is a cultural core built on a rich stew of aggressiveness and team orientation, on isolation and connectedness, and on being small and aiming big. Quantifying that hidden, cultural part of an economy is no easy feat. An unusual combination of cultural attributes. In fact, Israel scores high on egalitarianism, nurturing, and individualism. In Israel, the seemingly contradictory attributes of being both driven and \\"flat,\\" both ambitious and collectivist make sense when you throw in the experience that so many Israelis go through in the military. There is no leadership without personal example and without inspiring your team. The secret, then, of Israel's success is the combination of classic elements of technology clusters with some unique Israeli elements that enhance the skills and experience of individuals, make them work together more effectively as teams, and provide tight and readily available connections within an established and growing community.<br /><br />If you have arrived here, you were interested enough in this long article.

B000OPPBEQ|4.0|The Matix on blue ray isn't much to talk about. The quality is on par with DVD. They didn't even bother to change the label. But this film did come out before home theaters really became mainstream. The second two you can really tell the difference in sound and video. If your a fan this is a must have set

0812992792|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating books I've read in a long time - maybe my favorite book since The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.  Johnson's book, about the non-orphan Pak Jun Do, does a better job describing the horrors of life in North Korea than the non-fiction books (Aquariums of Pyongyang) I've read on the subject.  At the same time, this is not just a novel about the horrors of a strange and far-off land.  This is also a story of love and redemption.<br /><br />While at first, I found the time switches in the second chapter and the North Korean propaganda broadcasts sprinkled throughout the book confusing, they added a level of richness to the book that I don't think a sequential story would have contained.<br /><br />I hope this book gets lots of attention in order to bring attention to the horrifying reality that is North Korea.
B000VBIEXS|2.0|This is not a review of the band ELP nor the disc Brain Salad Surgery, but rather a review of the sonic characteristics of the remastered disc being sold on this listing produced by \\"Shout.\\" I am inspired by the other reviewers who have done a world of good by letting potential buyers know of the problems with the Shout disc. First let me thank them and encourage readers to read the lower ranked reviews.  I suppose that your experience with the Shout produced disc will depend on the type of equipment you listen with. For reference, this review was done on Audio Research amp and preamp, Dynaudio speakers and Cal Audio CD player. I think all who review should report the system they are using. I think professional reviewers should post their hearing tests. I assure that a 50 year old reviewer does not hear the same frequencies that a 30 year old reviewer hears. But that's another issue.  I agree with many of the comments from reviewers who do not like the sonic characteristics of this Shout remastered disc, but there is inconsistency with the tracks and some are good. For example, the cut \\"Still\\" is actually outstanding on this disc, while \\"Karn Evil\\" is so bad that it is irritating to listen to.  So what do you do? First, ask yourself if you are going to sit in front of your speakers and listen to the disc with a critical ear or have it on as you walk around the house. Are you going to listen through your iPod while you exercise? If it is the latter two, then you may have no issue with the poor overall sonic quality of the Shout disc.  If you fall into the first category and are a critical listener, there are options. The Victory produced disc, while no long produced, is available from many used vendors and is far superior to the remastered disc. In fact, pick up the Victory produced disc for \\"Trilogy\\" as it is sonically very impressive - more so than the Victory version of Brain Salad Surgery.  For critical listeners, I recommend buying the used Victory versions instead of this Shout version. Others have written that the Rhino produced disc is also very good, but I have not listened to it. Check out the Rhino disc as another option.  Hope you found this helpful.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|From the beginning of this series, I was hooked.  When I first heard about it through my sister, I figured that this type of book wasn't for me.  Too much death and rebellion, it seemed that it wasn't my usual cup of tea.  However, it is exactly that and so much more.  The characters come to life, you love every single one of them.  YOu feel their pain and resent other characters in the series as well.  I love the fact that there was a love triangle...however it wasn't overly done that the main story wasn't the love but the people of Panem as a whole.  You wanted Panem to live, and you wanted them to succeed in them re-establishing their freedom.  The love triangle was just juicy!!  I don't usually read books twice, but I've already started once again.

In this book you will find tips on swimming effortlessly, running faster and further, losing weight, bulking up, and even increasing libido.

If you are interested at all in health and fitness, this is a must read.
0738711500|5.0|I bought this deck last week, and already I LOVE it. I'm a novice when it comes to tarot, and this deck is possibly the best thing I've ever invested in. They responded to me right away, and Josephine Ellershaw's accompanying book has helped me learn a LOT about the cards.  The cards are absolutely stunning, and I would recommend this deck to novices and veterans alike. Great deck!!
0143119680|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  The first quarter was the most fun. I liked her building some new premises on how humans and creatures are related.  And the profiles of the various creatures. I didn't mind the sleeping or the toast (see other reviews) - I love both!!  After...the rest was a pleasant romance novel.  As it happens I like pleasant romance novels.  Especially ones with a little danger, haunted houses and quirky demons or daemons...I really don't care how she spells it.  I look forward to seeing where she takes the characters. Fortunately I didn't read the press, so I didn't have preconceived notions.
1419702238|5.0|With Christmas looming, Greg Heffley is unnerved by the constant threat of what could happen gift-wise if he messes up. It's too much tension for Greg, who wishes the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas could somehow magically shorten. After all, they say Santa can see you all the time, which kind of creeps Greg out. In fact, he has begun sending Santa letters to update him about his actions:  Dear Santa,  I did not throw a crab apple at Mrs. Taylor's cat, even though it might've looked that way from a distance.  Sincerely,  Greg Heffley  Even worse, though, than Santa himself is the \\"Santa's Scout\\" doll that Mom puts out around this time of year. According to her, Santa's Scout is keeping an eye on how her kids behave. He periodically reports his \\"nice or naughty\\" findings to Santa. Santa's Scout seems to show up everywhere in Greg's house, making him uneasy. Of course, he doesn't really believe that whole story about his reporting in, but just to be sure, he is on his best behavior around the doll.  Speaking of holiday traditions, it just wouldn't be the Heffley home if Mom wasn't bending over backwards to make Manny happy. For example, the family decorated their Christmas tree while he was napping. Big mistake! Someone hung his favorite ornament, so he threw a fit. When Mom took it off the tree so he could hang it up, Manny insisted that his be the very first ornament placed on the tree, which meant they had to remove all the decorations first to make him happy.  Bullies are a problem at Greg's school, so the students entered a contest to come up with the best anti-bullying slogan. Everyone wanted the grand prize, leading to a bit of an anti-bullying rumble. Greg's nemesis is a bully in his own neighborhood. No one knows exactly why, but this kid is nicknamed \\"Nasty Pants.\\" Rowley and Greg are scared silly of Nasty Pants, going way out of their way to avoid him. Finally, they call in some backup to confront the tyrant, which doesn't turn out the way you mightexpect.  Greg lampoons insurance and over-the-top school safety concerns, which have resulted in a playground lacking a few necessities but burdened with some ridiculous recess rules. For various reasons, though, Greg believes the new situation may improve his chances of getting some decent grades. Still, his expectations go hilariously awry yet again.  I think anyone would agree that our Greg is not exactly role-model material, yet he keeps revealing an unexpected sweet side. Take the present his mother decided he needed the year she was expecting Manny: a \\"realistic doll for boys\\" named Baby Alfrendo. Greg developed a soft spot for Alfrendo that had nothing to do with his discovery of some activities the doll really helped him with --- such as avoiding certain foods. And then, when Alfrendo goes missing, Greg is upset over losing his doll, but he's even more upset about family dynamics. His concern causes him to act inappropriately (Of course! This is Greg Heffley we're talking about!), but his motives are actually quite admirable.  CABIN FEVER is yet another example of hilarious deadpan delivery (complete with the perfect cartoony illustrations) highlighting life not only as a kid, but somehow exposing the ridiculous side of the universal human condition. This spot-on \\"I've been there, too\\" recognition of life's foibles continues to earn these Wimpy Kid stories the \\"No Matter What Your Age, You're Going to Love Reading These\\" award.

B005LAIGGY|5.0|Most of us in this country, indeed most of those in the civilized world, has a memory of where they were and how they felt on September 11, 2001.  Many, of course, have painful and permanent losses to deal with.  For myself, we were far from home on that day, and I truly felt that something of our world had ended.  Which, in fact it had.  So when it was announced that there would be a movie, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which would touch on those tragic events, our first response was, \\"No, we don't think so.\\"  Then we learned who was to be in this movie, and the cast included so many of our favorite actors:  Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, Max von Sydow, John Goodman, people we felt we could trust to do such a subject justice, and we said, \\"Well....\\"  Then we learned more about the story of the film (and story is everything, to us) and we asked ourselves, \\"How could we not see it?\\"<br /><br />And I'm so very glad we did.  Everyone is predictably excellent.  The story is beautifully done, and at the same time simple and deeply layered.  The child actor makes you believe he is dealing with the personal problems of the child character.  These problems would be unique and difficult enough, if they did not also include the loss of an incredible father under horrific circumstances, and you share the pain of this family of grandmother, mother and son, while the story is told from so many different directions.  Being one of those who cry at Hallmark commercials, I am always loathe to see any movie or play or read any book that wants to make me cry.  But this movie is not like that.  I did just fine throughout the entire story, experiencing it intensely but dry-eyed.  Until the end.  Until I got to the point where I could fully appreciate the efforts this family made to move forward, the grace with which they and the families they represented dealt with what they were given.  Until I could see the wonder of the story.<br /><br />It was terrible in the parts that invoked the events that we already knew had happened; it became wonderful beyond my power of description because of a boy on a swing.  And then I wept.invoked the events that we already knew had happened; it became wonderful beyond my power of description because of a boy on a swing.  And then I wept.

Dracula, The Wolfman, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Van Helsing, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, Vincent Price movies, etc all have run past my eyes, or through my head.  I've read and watched and listened to all of it.  I wanted to like this book, but as I read I found myself thinking of  one word:  ponderous.  The book is not good.  The story is stretched thin as a wire, leading to the next ponderous volume.  There really is no reason for this to be a three book series.  I got mine for free, thank goodness.  If I had paid money I would have felt ripped off.  The story is, even for a fantasy book, ridiculous.  This book was a horrible waste of time and resources and I completely disagree with the good reviews.  But then again, I also found Twilight to be pretty pathetic.  I do not jump on the bandwagon when something gets good reviews or if there is a lot of publicity.  I see for myself.  I have seen, and am about as unimpressed as it gets.  I kept waiting for the good part to start, and it never did.  What a waste.

B00406UK7S|5.0|I give this movie five stars although I did not like some details - but finally I simply did not have the heart to take one star for them. I liked this movie very much and many scenes are simply unforgettable.<br /><br />The action is set in year 117 AD, in the country which today is called Scotland but which Romans named Caledonia. This harsh and inhospitable land was inhabited by tribes which Romans called first Caledonians and later Picts. Caledonia was the only part of main British island which was not controlled by Roman Empire and Caledonians/Picts resisted fiercely all attempts of conquest - and in fact, in Ist and IInd centuries, frequently attacked Roman part of the island. The movie describes an episode of those Pictish wars, although because of lack of precise sources, it is not exactly based on real events and the names of the main leaders (Roman general Virilus and Pictish king Gorlacon) are fictive.<br /><br />To avoid spoilers I will not say much more about the plot - but please be aware that this is a very brutal and bloody movie, full of scenes of realistically described close quarters combat, but also of torture and murder. I believe this realism is ultimately an asset, but many people (and I think most women) will certainly find \\"Centurion\\" too shocking to watch. Under no circumstances children or younger teenagers should be allowed to see this movie - and I would in fact deeply recommend to restrict it only to those who are aged 18 years or more.<br /><br />\\"Centurion\\" shows a great deal of incredibly beautiful images of nature in northern part of Scotland (especially Cairngorms mountains and Badenoch district), attempting to show how did it look in times when its population was still scarce and nature mostly remained wild and untouched, with wolves and deers more easily met than humans. The forest scenes were filmed in natural parks in England. Those settings alone are a good reason to see \\"Centurion\\" as they are simply impossible to describe - you simply must see them! For that reason also I would really recommend to watch it on the biggest possible screen.<br /><br />Actors play well and the characters are interesting and well thought. Michael Fassbinder plays the main hero, centurion Quintus Dias, and his performance is very honest. However, two other actors steal the show from him: Dominic West and especially Olga Kurylenko.<br /><br />Dominic West already showed how versatile actor he was playing the ambiguous character of detective McNulty in \\"The Wire\\" but also the abject Spartan politician Theron in \\"300\\". Here he portrays the Roman general Virilus in another excellent performance. It was a pleasure to watch him.<br /><br />But the REAL performance is that of Olga Kurylenko, who plays Etain, a silent, never smiling Briton tracker/scout working for Romans. Etain can not speak (when she was a child her tongue was cut off) but still, her character dominates the whole movie - and it is not only because of the great beauty of Ms Kurylenko, as she is mostly wrapped in furs and her face is partly hidden by blue war paintings. Really, I found this character fascinating and totally unforgettable and I am certain she will mark you too!<br /><br />And finally a special mention for Imogen Poots, a very cute and absolutely lovely British actress who plays Pictish sorceress, Arian, and the gorgeous Belgian actress Axelle Carolyn (who is also the wife of the director of the movie, Neil Marshal), who plays Pictish female warrior, Aeron. This importance accorded to women is another point in favor of this movie. In Pictish society women were mostly equals of men and most of them were also warriors, to the point that some fought in battles carrying babies attached on their backs!<br /><br />Now, the one thing I did not totally like in this movie is the flawed representation of the way in which Roman Legions marched, camped and especially fought. When watching \\"Centurion\\" you must inevitably ask the question \\"But howcome those guys could conquer so many countries and build a three continent empire?\\" The answer is, those guys did not - but the real legions did, because they made war totally differently than pictured in this film. And this is a pity, because there clearly was an effort to stick to historical reality - like for example the fact that in this movie Roman soliders wear \\"lorica segmentata\\" armour, which in those times just replaced the previously used \\"lorica hamata\\" (chain mail). But the effort was not made when the tactics are described.<br /><br />I will just focus on the biggest issue - fighting tactics. Roman regular infantry was so dangerous because it used a mixture of missile and close combat weapons. The enemy was first engaged with highly specialized heavy javelins, the \\"pilum\\", of which every infantryman carried two: one lighter and one heavier. The lighter javelin was thrown first (because it had a longer range), then the heavier and then only the legion would close the ranks in a shield wall and engage the enemy with short but quite heavy Roman swords \\"gladius\\". The important thing is that Roman swords were perfectly adapted for stabbing (with an upward thrust) but rather poorly suited for slashing. Or in \\"Centurion\\" NOT EVEN ONE \\"pilum\\" is thrown and in fact Roman soldiers do not even carry them. Instead all of them have classical long spears - which in reality would be used only by a small minority of eldest soldiers (whose arms were not so strong and their eyes not so good anymore) for protection against a possible cavalry charge. Also Roman soldiers slash wildly at their enemies with their short swords, without even trying to use them efficiently...<br /><br />There is also the little point of a general who walks through hostile wild country without any flank guard, even if he has some nimble footed auxiliary light infantry suited for this task - one of the heroes, Leonidas, is after all a lightly equipped Greek slinger. And of course any such expedition should relay for all reconnaissance only on one indigenous tracker and two Roman cavalrymen, giving a total of three (yes, three!) horse riding scouts for the security of a whole army (the Ninth Legion and all its \\"auxillia\\").<br /><br />However, although I certainly did not like that part of the movie, all the rest was so good and made on me such a strong impression, that I simply couldn't take one star off the rating.come those guys could conquer so many countries and build a three continent empire?\\" The answer is, those guys did not - but the real legions did, because they made war totally differently than pictured in this film.

I'm currently using two 23\\" Dell U2311Hb monitors.  What's nice about this product (at least with the specific type of monitor I'm using) is that when I turn off my monitor it turns off the power to the USB ports so the lights turn off with it.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|As others have so aptly stated, many words cannot convey the beauty of this definite masterpiece of a movie.  One of the greatest movies, I believe, of the last 50 years.  Finally, a recent movie without any weapons, no chase scenes, NOT action-packed, NO buildings exploding. It's about peace, forgiveness, a hidden sense of a supreme being behind the reasons of LOVE for the only operating principle of life.  I would give it ten stars if I could.  When will the world learn that beyond all the spiritual and humanitarian reasons for gentleness, mercy and love...that the practice of violence is extremely low taste.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|Although it's missing Clear Channel's stations and CBS still doesn't put their music stations on here, this is still the best radio streaming app for Android.  The sound quality/stream is user selectable for optimum quality, the global selection is wonderful and the interface seems to work very well on my Galaxy S Showcase.<br /><br />There are two very minor things I would like to see changed, however.  I would love it if the application could start on the favorite stations tab, and I would love it if I could set a preferred stream type, so that it tries to use AAC instead of MP3 or WMA for each station.  It seems to pick a different stream at random each time it connects.

It's just decent, entertaining electronic music.

I was concerned to see that the Certified Frustration Free Packaging meant that all I had to do was tip the box in order for the perfect gift to fall out of it's box. I only have to wonder how many times it has fallen out during transport, and be thankful for trustworthy people who didn't steal it. I haven't opened the shrink wrap on the item yet, so I hope it is not broken. In the future, I'd rather be frustrated opening the package than have it be broken or not there when I go to retrieve it.

B004EPZ0AM|1.0|My parents forced me to watch the first terrible movie, which was about how poor and awful these penguins are because humans eat the exact same food that penguins do. Plus there was all the annoying dancing and such. Oh, but guess what? They were so excited to get our three year old daughter to watch this new one. My daughter even got bored and walked away. My mom sure likes these movies (she's also a big fan of the Ernest movies), but I can't stand them. How many CG animated movies do we need about penguins anyway? Tap dancing penguins, surfing penguins, penguins at the zoo... I'm tired of this crap. Stop force-feeding us computer animated movies (unless they're Pixar) and start making some decent animated movies instead. I put in The Secret of Nimh instead and my kid was glued to the TV.  Parents, if you are concerned with the dumbing down of this country, you need to say no to inane tripe like these Happy Feet movies. I sure hope there won't be a third movie. People, you vote with your wallets!
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I loved this movie, I thought is was the best of all of the franchise! The costumes should win an award and the acting was outstanding. I would recommend everyone take the time to watch this movie. The character Ceasar was so human like it was unreal. I've seen all of the movies and this one is my favorite of them all. The scenes and landscapes was so up to date but it goes to show you that some things in the world of science should be left alone as far as teaching animals to talk verbally not just by sign language, but the movie was good none the less.  I'm going to watch it again!
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|There are well over 100 reviews of this film on Amazon now - most of them based on the theatrical release - so I won't bore you with many more details about the film itself. I'll concentrate more on the DVD release - especially the Blu-Ray disc which has a few more Special Features than the Standard DVD.<br /><br />As for the film, I'm not a huge sports fan but I was engaged throughout the full two-hour-plus length. Though Brad Pitt will always look like Brad Pitt playing someone, the rest of the cast including Philip Seymour Hoffman and the amazing Jonah Hill (sooooooo low key that you almost overlook his performance, but cheer with him in the end) blend in well with the REAL sports players that Director Bennett Miller incorporated into his cast. And fans of \\"The West Wing\\" (I'm a huge one) will spot some of the well-crafted lines by the screenplay writer, Aaron Sorkin.<br /><br />The Standard DVD bonus features include four deleted scenes (12 minutes), Blooper Rell (3 minutes), and  \\"Moneyball - Playing The Game\\" the standard \\"behind the scenes\\" featurette with lots of clips you have just seen(19 minutes).. The BD adds two more featurettes that are more interesting: \\"Drafting the Team\\" about casting (20 minutes) and \\"Adapting Moneyball\\" (about it's conversion into a film with discussions by the screenwriter. (16 minutes).<br /><br />Sports fans of any sport will love this. Oakland As fans probably bought this the day it came out!<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

B006E4QCXU|5.0|great app for the kf. totally worth the asking price. but getting it for free wasnt a bad deal though.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Very cool, but was over it after about 15 minutes. Feel like it would be better if it did different patterns than just the one.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I love this anime so much.  Its story is great and teaches people about nature and what can happen to it if nature is not treated right.

B004X80QNG|4.0|Best calendar app yet, but still needs improvement: 1  very slow to show events on open (over a minute on Intercept) 2  New events won't default to Google Calendar (must be selected each time) 3  Can't move to SD to conserve phone memory
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This is a base plot line, incredibly bad animation, and taught mixed values to any child that watches it. The MPAA should be ashamed of themselves for letting this garbage come to fruition
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very. addictive. don't update you lose progress but this game is so much fun! this is a must play first starts slow then I cant shop trying to beat. my levels
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I have 3 teenagers... 2 boys and a girl and we wanted a movie to watch over the weekend that we all would enjoy. It is hard to find a movie that pleases both the boys, myself and my daughter. She likes chic flicks and they like, well...guy movies...  However, for the entire movie, they were all entertained. The movie seems a little slow to develop, but once it did....WOW...The effects and acting were great. The son, portrayed by Dakota Goyo makes the movie for me. I mean, we all know Hugh Jackman and Evangeline Lilly can act and they do not disappoint in the movie. But Dakota's perfomance is outstanding.  Throughout the movie, with Jackman's character, I hated him, loved him, hated him again and finally was cheering for him by the end. Some of the fight scenes literally had me on the edge of my seat and a few times I felt like clapping! I wish it would have ended a little differently, I won't spoil it for you. Just watch and see if you agree!  There was some language but in my opinion it it okay for families with teens and possibly tweens. It has a great message!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I admit that I was no great fan of the first Happy Feet. I just couldn't get involved in the story at all and the tap dancing aspect was just sort of \\"meh\\" for me. I definately didn't think Happy Feet deserved a sequal and when I sat down and watched it.... I found out that I was absolutely correct. It was just a poorly written movie with unlikable and annoying characters. On top of that, I just found it boring. I doubt it'll hold your kid's attention and I certainly don't think you will enjoy it very much. Plus, considering the corrupt buisness policies of the MPAA, pouring more money into their pockets is not a good idea for you at this point. Save your money for something of much higher quality entertainment.
B004EPZ02A|3.0|I enjoyed the movie with the exception of one thing...why did you cut out a lot of the movie we all wanted left in??? Are the clips from the trailers going to be added to make an extended version??? I collect movies and will not buy this unless the scenes will be added. In my opinion it would have made the movie a lot better. I am speaking for a group of ten of us that saw this in the theatre. Hope to see the footage added!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love it. Love it. Love it. Definitely my fav, 2nd only to my Bible app and I haven't even tapped its full potential.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|It was a good movie to put my 3 kids to sleep in the movie theater. I don't know what violent reaction you will get when you loop this over and over again. Terrible, terrible movie.
B000002KB8|5.0|I was 12 or 13 when this album came out. I was just beginning to explore Hendrix, Cream, Jefferson Airplane, and Santana to mention a few. To me at the time this was a hard rock album, but I won't argue the label of heavy metal. In fact, if you like this type of music check out a band named Bang (the first 2 albums) you might like it. What people call hard rock or heavy metal these days doesn't excite me in the least and being 53 years old I suppose that it should be that way. For my money I'll take Bang and the first 4 Black Sabbath albums and leave the rest. Ozzie Osbourne is an idiot in my opinion or maybe the alcohol and drugs have had a major impact on his judgement when it comes to guitar players after he left Sabbath (he has fired a lot of great guitarists). Well, so be it. On the other hand, he was the perfect singer for this group though I hate to admit that. While Master of Reality is probably my favorite album, I think the 1st album by Black Sabbath is their best album bar none. Tommi Iommi is a fantastic guitar player and he is the true voice of the group in my opinion so there you have it.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I bought these DVDs for a cousin of mine who, at that time, had no acces to the internet (that cousin of mine is female...but then, you guys had gessed it !). She tried to tape the shows off from the TV broadcasts, but never managed to get the whole series, never mind the films.  She must certainly love these DVDs, for she as seen, and reseen, them several times, and always with the same pleasure.  For my part, I even refused her offer to borrough them (I never cared to watch the shows on TV, so...), so I have no opinion, and the five stars are more hers than mine.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater and it SUCKED so bad. Me and my GF actually walked out 'cause it bored the living crap out of us !
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|My friend told me not to watch but I didn't listen and went to see it with my nieces and it sucked.  Review should be 0 star.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games so far.  I've only had it for a few days but it is a lot of fun.  Great short games to kill time while you are waiting.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a great family game!  My son learned of it while serving in the Peace Corps and introduced it to us. It's a thinking, strategy board game, and is fun for all ages.  Our family members ages 12 to 84 just love it!
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Diana Gabaldon's books are getting so much longer and I really wouldn't have an issue with it if she had anything worth saying! Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this book, but she really is in need of a good editor. There is too much detail to small things that slows the pace down. The first half of the book was very slow and uninteresting.<br /><br />I have to say that I really disliked the character, Brianna. She is spoiled, foolish, and petulant. Several of her mishaps could have been avoided had she just used some common sense. She does so many stupid things that I really lacked any sort of sympathy for her. I felt much more sorry for Roger because the Frasers put him through hell.<br /><br />The book is slow, builds steam, putters out, than builds again. It is possible to tell a good story without the extra information. I got the sense that this particular book didn't have much direction. It seemed put together just for the sake of writing another Jamie/Claire adventure, but this one lacked in adventure.<br /><br />Favorite characters were Roger, Ian and Rollo (Ian's dog).
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this case. It is even prettier than what it looks like in the picture. Easy to put the Kindle in. I have had numerous comments on how good it looks. Fits perfectly into my purse. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!
B006E4QCXU|4.0|i think that is pretty cool. when you mess with it if you lag attention there's like design things in the pixels/stars.... not quite 5stars though.
B004V8W54Q|3.0|To get it out of the way, Brazil is simply an amazing film that anyone and everyone needs to see. If you haven't seen it yet, find the nearest non-\\"Love Conquers All\\" edition and watch the heck out of it. You won't be disappointed. The reason for only 3-stars is because this seems to be a compromised version of both the director's cut and the studio cut. There are about 10 minutes of footage as well as some vital scenes missing. To top it off, some parts of the movie are completely rearranged. If you're a fan of the movie, don't waster your time with the blu-ray, stick with the Criterion Collection Special edition(the version formatted for widescreen tv's).
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Obvious disappointing sequel after a mediocre movie.  Stop milking every cow till they run dry. Make original movies.  Everything in this movie is bland. It is simply a quick cash cow.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This product works great! Best remote desktop I have used to date. It's quick and not glitchy. Only problem I have is I can't stream video or music through it onto my device.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the very best app I have ever played if I get bored with one game I just play another its
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I made better use of my time reviewing this movie, than I did watching it. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who values their time.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|As a Bond fan, I was dismayed when I heard Daniel Craig was going to be assuming the role, Daniel Craig as Bond in this film is about a subtle as a hammer through a window. There's no mystery here, only an endless body count and a rare bout of sex. Bond is little more than child in this role who successfully allows his vendetta to run its course by destroying just about everything in his path save Vesper's lover. It only gets more hard to follow when you throw in 'Bolivia Intelligence' former or not, into the mix. The question also begs to be asked, MI6 has cutting edge technology but you can't give an agent a bulletproof vehicle or any serious heavy duty firepower? Sigh) I'd give anything for someone to walk in and give Bond a brain along with a mystery to solve. There's no detective work, it's just Bond killing bad guys who presently themselves all too conveniently. Welcome to the new Bond - GI Joe in a suit and tie in & out of the bedroom.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love everything about this app.  Our church has goal of reading thrum the Bible in 1 year and this app has some great reading plans.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Dont watch this it is a horrible movie a waste of time and money. Even children will not like this movie, thanks again Hollywood for a waste of our time.
B00005B36H|5.0|LATERALUS is a progressive metal trip, an inward journey to enlightenment.  This is perhaps not totally obvious without the lyrics, which are not included with the album, but I retrieved them online and with them in hand the Big Picture makes more sense.<br /><br />Letting go of grudges and anger (\\"The Grudge\\"), becoming aware of the need to work at communicating with others (\\"Schism\\") -- these are important steps on the path.  With \\"Parabola,\\" the journey goes deeper:  \\"Spinning, weaving round each new experience.  Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing.\\"  The title song represents the culmination of the quest:  \\"I embrace my desire to ... feel connected ... to swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human ... We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.  Spiral out.  Keep going...\\"  The last three songs represent a state of enlightenment, no longer characterized by metal power chords, but rather a mysterious flow with tribal drumming and Middle Eastern sounds.  \\"Disposition\\" recognizes the need to \\"crucify the ego, before it's far too late,\\" and asserts that \\"we are all one mind, capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable.\\"<br /><br />LATERALUS is obviously not just a collection of songs -- it is a well-conceived progressive metal concept album.  There is one problem though.  I think \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" is out of place, an angry song aimed at greedy record company executives, it would seem.  While I'm sure there are good reasons for this anger on the part of MJK and the band, the song disrupts the progression of the music.  The instrumental passage toward its end is great, but the anger of the lyrics and vocals seem to undercut the album's message.<br /><br />But I won't hold a grudge over that one flaw.  This album deserves the praise and recognition it has received!<br /><br />Peace, shalom, salaam, namasthe.
B005KELS6Q|5.0|I JUST WANTED A CASE TO BUT MY KINDLE IN SO IT WOULDN'T GET SCRATCHED WHEN I PUT IT IN MY PURSE. THIS WORKS WONDERFULLY. ALOT OF PADDING AND I LIKE THE BRIGHT COLOR I CAN'T MISS PLACE IT I CAN ALWAYS SEE THAT COLOR.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I found the premise of this book series to be \\"out there\\" for it to be very good. Once I started book one...I couldn't stop reading. The details are so vivid, you can imagine yourself there... you can feel the emotions. Don't miss out because you feel this sounds more like a \\"teen\\" book series.  It was amazing; hope the movie does it justice.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|What exactly is it that makes this app whisper to one person, \\"come, make beautiful interactive art, have fun!\\" and at apparently the same time, tells others that; \\"I am pretty, but rather boring and hardly worth a second glance\\"?  I suspect that it whispers the same machine code to the both of us ~ I'm lucky to hear the first phrase from that code. :)  But then, I'm a 55 year old man who enjoys frogs (among other things) to no end! The way they look, the way they hop, swim, and mostly, the way they sing. Maybe I'll take this toy outside and play with it while I listen to the frog chorus. :D  Great work! Keep it up!  As a FAOTD this is quite obviously a steal ~ but I think that for the normal asking price of a couple of dollars, it is still very much worth the purchase ~ especially if  you own a tablet! Still looks great on my Infuse 4g.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am always looking for way to get the Bible into my day, this is easy to use and even reminds me! especially as a free app.

B000F1IQMS|5.0|It deserve the Oscar, no doubt about it. Although is long you will remain in your seat. The actors were pretty good, too.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I had to rate it 5 stars because that's what the movie deserves. However, I'm pretty sure that the blu-ray case is used. It was scuffed and scratched, very dull blue as opposed to my other blu-rays, and there were scraps of the sticky plastic material on the top and side (the stuff you usually have to peel off to open). All of this was under plastic wrap so I know the scuffs and scratches were not just rough handling, I think they just put a new blu-ray disk in a used case and switched out the paper insert. Anyway not that big of a deal but the dull scratched blue definitely stands out against my other blu-rays in the rack. Unless you're a perfectionist this probably won't matter, unfortunately I am.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun it challenges ur mind and creates an addiction love it a must need for any device
B003L77G6K|5.0|Great transaction and very fast delivery. This is the funniest show on TV right now. I ordered all 4 seasons (and pre-ordered the 5th) and have already watched every episode.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun for the first day or two but then the games get really pricey so it is kinds hard to unlock them
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Yeah, I it was more fun than I thought it would be. Definitely worth the free download, so do it while you can!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This movie was great.  The story was great and real and it was made so anyone can relate.  The actor was decent but not like a normal Hollywood film.  You will enjoy this movie for sure.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it when I win - determined to get back when I lose.  I'm such a newby at Spider that I can't even think in terms of more than one suit, but know I'll eventually get there.  Love the challenge!

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I can't believe I actually went to the theatres to see this. What a waste of time and money! Sheesh!
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I saw her perform Video Games on Letterman. I was hooked. I don't buy much music anymore, rather depending on the radio, Pandora, or other online services. However, I immediately bought this album.  Video Games is a wonderful \\"torch\\" song. It's entrancing and relaxing. The rest of the album is good though a bit more upbeat than Video Games. She blends various styles wonderfully. I look forward to more from her in the future.  FYI, I'm 49 and like music ranging from pop to goth metal to country to rap. I like most music easily, but it's harder to get me to love a song enough to buy it. Give this album a chance. You won't regret it.
B006OT03BM|5.0|\\"This is for the Uberfan.\\" This set is exactly what it is. Michael Bay over the top wonderful, just like the movies were. If you liked the movies, you'll love this set. It's got it all. It has a proud spot in my old, very large collection. Read about the video/audio reviews of each flick in other places. There are many. My review is only about this edition. Awesome. Nuff Said.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Was looking for something lightweighted and easy to use, and this is worthy. Although the price is a little too expensive. I recommend it to anyone.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this game was great!  the graphics were really good and so was the music. if the game got a little too hard, there was a walkthrough right on the game!  there's also a journel that records puzzles so you don't have to keep going back. i did nooot get boring. 5 stars! (:
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Ever watched a movie and thought \\"they only made this because the first was popular and thought they could make more money\\"? Well, this movie is a wonderful example.
0446547654|5.0|I was really happy they picked this book for our Christian women's book club because I really like Nicholas Sparks and once again he did not disappoint me. The way he wove so many peoples lives together was very fast paced and hard to put down readable.
0525423281|4.0|4.5 stars  I can't even deny that I want to be Lola when I grow up. She has fun clothes, colorful wigs and a quirky, artistic personality. There was a perfect mixture of sarcasm and sweetness to her. It was hard for me to see her as a teenage girl. She is definitely not average.  Lola's parents are fantastic but they were not fans of Lola's older boyfriend, Max. I really liked him too though. At least at the start, that is. He seemed sweet and attentive to her, even having family dinner every Sunday, which he did not feel comfortable doing.  Lola seemed to have everything going along smoothly. Great parents, awesome best friend and hot boy friend.  Then the two people Lola never wanted to see again moved back into the neighborhood. The last thing she wanted was to see childhood crush Cricket through the bedroom window next door. But he was back, and more perfect than ever. Cricket is adorable and smart. (And parental approved!)  I am such a sucker for the unrequited love story. Or when two people are torn apart by means they can't control. Then they find their way back together some how. I always want things to fall back into place so perfectly. But I guess if that happened, there would be no point in the story or book.  When Lola starts hanging out with Cricket it causes tension with Max. It was so funny to me that he would be jealous of a teenage boy. I guess he could see that Lola's feelings for Cricket still lingered though. He started to get jerky, which made me sad since I'd like him before.  Luckily, Cricket kept right on being he's sweet self and his relationship with Lola continued to solidify.  I might have cheered many times for the two of them.  I'm pretty sure Ms. Perkins wrote Cricket for every girl that has ever loved a boy friend. He is adorable and I wanted to hug him. Or turn him into a real boy. Especially when all the stars aligned and Lola was free to love him. And vice versa.  Oh! Is this spoilery? I hope not, because I have to say, the appearances of Anna and St. Clair from Anna and the French Kiss were icing on the awesome cake!  Such a happy heart, I have.
0756405890|5.0|I am an avid fantasy reader.  I received this book as a gift, and what a wonderful gift it was!!  When I was pregnant, I was hospitalized with complications for a long time & thought I would go bonkers just laying in bed all day!! This book took me to another world where I was able to not worry as much about my soon to be daughter. I would have read it under normal circumstances.  Highly recommend & worth re-reading!!!  Can't wait to start the next one, just kinda busy being a mommy now.  My usual nightly reading has been replaced with sleeping!! Being a mommy is exhausting!!! Bravo Patrick!!
0525423273|5.0|As if high school can't be complicated enough Anna's parents decide to send her away to an American school in Paris. Now, to me, that sounded like a really cool thing to get to do. But not to Anna. She has a great best friend, an almost boyfriend and a cool little brother - none of which she wants to leave behind. Anna doesn't know anyone at this new school and she doesn't speak a word of French.  Her dad is such a lame guy that you can't help but giggle over his ridiculousness. He's the reason she's being sent to school in an entirely different country. Her mom seems flighty and  Anna herself is funny, smart and sarcastic. I enjoyed her inner monologue so much. Shortly after her arrival she meets her 'neighbor' in the dorm, Meredith. Mer does everything she can to make Anna feel at home by introducing her to Mer's own eclectic group of friends.  When Anna meets St. Clair she feels connected to him right away. Bummer though, he has an older girlfriend. Anna thinks their relationship is great but through a nice slow build up, you learn it is not. The two of them become good friends and she falls head over heels in love with St. Clair and he with her.  Anna's adventures and explorations in Paris are so fun to read through her eyes. I instantly wanted to pack up and be sent off to a boarding school. I mean, geez, it didn't seem all that bad once Anna allowed herself to have fun and make friends. I'm kind of jealous of her actually.  I instantly loved every character in this book. It felt bright and sunny, and lifted my heart up. I am such a fan of something that is light and makes me smile for days. Anna and the French Kiss did that so well. It was a breath of fresh air!
0062011847|3.0|The City Watch stories are my favorite (along with Carpe Jugulum).  I didn't care for this one because I felt the story had specific plot points linked together by pompous lecturing, tedious introspection and repetition.  I've never thought of Sam Vimes as pompous but he really came across as holier than thou in this book.  In the end, his confrontation with Vetinari seemed out of character considering that he knows how the Patrician works and shouldn't have been surprised by the outcome.  I loved Sybil.  Her character seemed more like Sam should have been in some parts of the story.  I thought young Sam's obsession was overdone.  He only seemed to be of use to make the plot move along.  I liked the basic plot and some of the subplots--although they weren't tied together as expertly as I expected.  I would have loved a shorter story which would have given the novel a faster pace and maybe.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I saw this movie in the movie theater and it sucked so bad I wanted to shoot myself. it's not funny or entertaining in any shape or form. Use your money to support a small business instead of this awful production made by a million dollar industry.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game a lot!  It was easy to learn, and the graphics are wonderful.  I love the categories of the game, although I use random game all the time.  I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did...thanks for making it a free game!

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|When I saw this movie, I was expecting to a least be moderately entertained considering the actors who are playing lead roles. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The plot had little to do with anything meaningful, the acting was kind of okay, the general feel was just... uncomfortable. Another atrocious movie that I would not recommend to anyone.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|If you love movies, you will love \\"Midnight in Paris.\\"  The script is intelligent, wise, and, of course, very witty.  Owen Wilson is perfect; funny and likeable.  The cinematography is Oscar worthy.  Mr. Allen is in love with Paris, just as he is love with New York, and \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is as beautiful as it is wise and funny.  The central theme of the movie is the human nostalgia for a Golden Age.  Even though this longing is doomed because no Golden Age exists, the ideal elevates the longing for a Golden Age beyond mere nostalgia into a dream that makes everyday reality more beautiful and meaningful.  For me, the romantic longing to live in the same Paris with Hemingway and Fitzgerald, two tragic and brilliant figures, permits me to understand, as most viewers will understand, the powerful desire to visit this Golden Age of creativity and beauty.  Like his other poem of love, \\"Manhattan,\\" Mr. Allen's \\"Midnight in Paris\\" perfectly captures the beauty and romance of a magical city that is more than a city:  it is the realization of our longing for perfection, which, sadly, we will never achieve.  But the striving for the ideal, while doomed to fail, is beautiful and inspiring.  \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a movie for lovers and especially for those who love movies and the dreams they inspire.

From my earlier experience as a researcher in machine learning/AI-related field, I found the plot entertaining and offered some opportunities to think about the \\"design space\\" and potential unintended consequences of machine learning.  Any analogy to the cliche'd example of HAL (Space Odyssey) is actually apt in this aspect.  While the characters (human) seem to go through the entire story with no development, Harris' focus is probably on the main character - which is not human at all.  Viewed from that perspective, he is able to develop a convincing plot while the interspersed real-life current events (DJIA's flash crash, European debt crisis, etc)add a ring of credibility of the plot development.  The plot (and the progress of machine learning research implied in this novel) is so realistic, labeling it as \\"sci-fi\\" is not too accurate.  This being my first introduction to Harris, I can't compare his earlier works - but is such a comparison even warranted? This work in itself is a fun, entertaining read that anyone with even a superficial exposure to the controversies of hedge fund trading and machine learning can truly appreciate.  An excellent read and I'm glad I got introduced to this author's works.

B004EPZ0AM|1.0|Barely any content, cheap exploitation of the brand in expectation kids and parent will swallow the product.  The whole pinguin thing is used by coke and other big brands to get to your kids too.  I had trouble looking at the whole thing. Soon to be in garbage bin all around the world.
B0061S073A|5.0|awesome app for my 2 1/5 yr old. keeps him out of the Internet and prevents him from purchasing apps on the amazon store.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|this is a great movie, it's not as scary as the first film (they rarely ever end up better) but it's still quite enjoyable and ties up the loose end from the first movie. though now I kind of want to see what they do for the third one.<br /><br />the only thing I didn't like is the DVD case. now I know that this has become the new standard for dvds to have parts of the plastic removed on both covers (usually in triangles under the disc and in a recycle symbol on the front cover) which is fine so long as you don't take it anywhere. I have a usb dvd drive for my netbook so on days when I have time to kill I'll just take a movie with me and watch it on campus. I did this when I watched this movie, as I opened my bag I found that a pencil had jabbed two holes through the back of the case (luckily it didn't break the plastic but the back cover has two tears in the paper which can touch the disc, this might not sound like a big deal to the average user but for anyone out there who's done any work with disc media knows they can get scratched even by a bit of paper or even just dust on a table, whats the point of a case for the disc if it can't be used as such? don't get me wrong, I'm all for recycling but this isn't recycling, it's just cost cutting by the manufacturer to lower their own costs (the plastic that's removed is simply put back into the machine sort of like what they do with the glaze at krispy kreme)<br /><br />I won't take a star off for it (since it's still a good movie and is fairly cheap at $4.99) but still be warned if you like to travel with movies that it has a weaker case.
0061969656|5.0|If you have read the earlier books in this series, you won't be disappointed - except that this one is a bit shorter than the rest.  Highly entertaining - I could not put it down.
B00005JMYI|4.0|A very great film, the characters are funny, the story is great, and there are just so many cameos it blows you away! (pretty much every single person that says even a word of dialogue is well known, some serious star power here)<br /><br />the Unrated version of the film is definitely the best, be warned they drop some \\"F\\" bombs that weren't in the original (specifically when he says \\"go screw yourself San Diego\\" they change that to...you get the picture)<br /><br />the extras are what make this set a steal, blooper reels, commentaries, and a lot of neat extras from before the film came out are included. but what's better than all of that (and in one way disappointing) is the deleted scenes. they are hilarious! there are so many things they took out or changed! (one of my favorite scenes is actually a deleted one where the actor who plays the janitor on scrubs makes a cameo as a police officer, very funny) so many great scenes that it honestly felt like a second (shorter) movie! the only problem with them is it appears that they took it from old analog recordings rather than the digital one the film is shown as on the dvd so it looks grainy which really disappointed me.<br /><br />still overall it is very great, and for the price is well worth getting.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I really got a lot from this film.  I found it to be non-preachy from an anti-meat perspective and over all very informative.  The reviewers that did not like the film may likely fall into the category of those who just don't want to hear the truth.  How can you argue with the fact that the USDA doesn't inspect nearly the amount that goes into our food supply that it needs to? How can you argue that it was okay to fail to announce a recall of meat that was known about 16 days before a young child died from e coli poisoning? I thought the film was very well done and promoted much thought after watching.
B005V20JKI|5.0|this game is PURE EPICNESS!!? it is so bad ass. it is so bad ass. this game is PURE EPICNESS!!?
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie is just another blatant money grab. It's predictable, boring, and not worth you time. Even my small children didn't like it.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|I think it is dumb don't play. it is stupid All u do is press the screen it is a waste. of your time so please don't play or u will regret. it if u do
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This is really cool and suprisingly relaxing. Nice and simple graphics, I can see myself playing with this a lot!
B0040QYROK|5.0|* The (almost) complete Metropolis (released by KINO) is one of the greatest movies ever made, silent or sound.  - The music in the majestic opening soars. And then the viewer realizes this is a film set to a symphonic poem. It is a symphony set to a movie. And the dramatic music helps the dramatic acting make sense. Metropolis is like a silent film grand opera.  And what wonderful music. This soundtrack by Gottfried Huppertz is one of the best film scores I've heard and ranks with the finest from Bernard Herrmann or John Williams.  - Then we see the spectacular city of Metropolis. This film has terrific use of miniatures, impressive sets and special effects for its time.  The story is interesting with its focus on economic class, the danger of oppression and anarchy. This complete version has the important back story which explains many of the motivations of the characters. There is also plenty of intriguing symbolism in Metropolis including from the Bible.  - Over the years I have been watching increasingly longer versions of Metropolis as new footage has been found and put together in different releases. The almost complete version by KINO is a tremendous leap forward. But the new footage (about 30 minutes) has only been partially restored. So, some sections have lots of lines from scratches. It is still watchable though. Hopefully more money will eventually be found to digitally improve the new images.  But I appreciate all the effort in the KINO Blu-Ray release. (The only thing missing is an audio commentary but there is a 6 page booklet and 2 documentaries about the restoration.) Overall you can see the devotion to produce a high-quality product.  * Since I am a film enthusiast, my rating is about the movie itself and I know how far this restoration has come. Now that Metropolis is almost complete, we clearly have a brilliant landmark in the history of film.
B004132HZS|5.0|If you haven't seen this new SHERLOCK mystery series, be prepared to be delighted.  What an imaginative, original series!  The acting is brilliant. I enjoy watching the facial expressions and interaction between Sherlock and Watson.  The dialogue is fantastic. Quirky camera shots, complex plots, stunning cinematography, and amazing music add up to a mesmerizing show.  You want to rewatch episodes to catch the details you missed the first time.  So much thought went behind each frame, each scene.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This app is great to play with on my touchpad. It looks really cool and the physics are awesome. I would recommend this app
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been using this ap for a few months now, and have never had a problem with it. I keep it near my head, so even at the lowest volume, I'm waking up. Love all the features/settings it allows for. Snooze button is much larger since update, and I've never had a problem when trying to use the onscreen shut off button.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hachi!!!  For anyone who loves dogs this is as good as it gets - it transends  the usual Hollywood trash.  I highly recommend it for all ages.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|It was free. But it is not worth keeping. I tried it and it's boring almost immediately so I am uninstalling.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I dont know why, but i want my money back for this lame movie.  It is just another ripoff movie that is just made for making more money into their thick pockets.
B001D0DQUC|4.0|I recently purchased this movie off amazon and rewatched it. Its probably been 15 years since my last viewing. Ferris Bueller's day off was one of my favorites as a kid, now in my mid 30's its still a classic teen comedy. No it cant kep up with newer faster paced comedys and there are a few spots in the movie that somewhat drag on, but its still great fun ! i watched it the same day it arrived and am happy to now have it in my collection. I think this is one of thoses movies that it greatly depends on your age and mood. My wife is 8 years my junior (27) and she didnt care for the movie.. said it was too slow  :)
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Uninspired and pathetic. Honestly, I can't believe this got Green-lighted. DO NOT RECOMMEND. And yes, I have seen it. Ech...
B0000A98ZP|4.0|I too loved this movie in the 80's. It was so rebelious and cut to the bone of social groups in school.. and boy did it nail the groups well !  well times move forward, this is still a fun movie but what was once edgy is now common.  im glad its in my collection but dont see this as a annual viewing must.. maybee every 4-5 years !
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love this game. ive been playing it since I was about 9 years old. one of my favorite games of all time. : )
B0055SWM08|5.0|I don't usually like games like this for long, but this one is addicting!  Very nice graphics, great concept, difficult enough for casual play.  A lot of value for $.99!
B004X80QNG|1.0|This app is not the least bit user friendly. I know that useful apps don't have to be cosmetically attractive but they should at least be able to be used without the huge learning curve.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great Bible app. you can have reading plans you can take notes and of course read jdjdke. r d d d d d e d e e r r just said that so i can submit it sorry
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|My daughters and I watch this DVD at least once a month. The cinematography, the actors, and the music are captivating! We know most of the scenes by heart. Can't get enough of it!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I loved Stephen King's 'IT'. I've read it twice and I plan on reading 'IT' again. If you haven't checked it out, you should. A 5 star book.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I love this. the most relaxing thing I have done all week. I'm hooked. it amazes me how much I love staring at these &quot;stars&quot;. thank you!
B00555X8OA|4.0|Dr. Kahneman's writing is modest and engaging.  The results of numerous experiments are presented clearly and the theories that he and his (now deceased) colleague developed are explained convincingly.  The book is marred somewhat by typos (but I guess copyediting is a lost art).
B000008GHW|5.0|I own this album, but I wanted to listen to this in my car and at work on my CD player. This is an over looked gem.  Belly Button Window is a social commentary about abortion from the baby's point of view.  Angel is just a beautiful piece of music and perhaps a little prophetic. My Friend, Straight Ahead and Drifting are also beautiful - perhaps another side of Hendrix that people aren't accustomed to.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This must the worst movie ever made. Even Ed Wood has some better movies than this garbage. If you want to throw money away, buy this movies.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Fun for the first 5 minutes, but there's nothing more to it. I agree with other users. Please make it into a live wallpaper.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|This lady is the #1 women in her arena in America that I am aware of !  She is also a Classic Dancer. She's so good , she's in hiding!  This is an AMAZING Example of Accomplishment !
0694016756|5.0|Its a great book for babies, I have given several of them for baby gifts.  Before long they will have it memorized and will be \\"Reading \\" it to you.  It's on story board  form and doesn't tear, it will last forever.  It comes in two different sizes.  I highly recommend it.  I always get mine on Amazon, its cheaper.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I think I read one post that said this is really for the fans and I could not agree more. This was one of my favorite of the series. I felt like Kristen Stewart was FINALLY Bella from the books. Don't get me wrong I like Kristen Stewart I think she is a good actress but I was almost frustrated with her because in the others you can tell she tried to put her own spin on things but this was kept true to the story and as a fan I appreciated that.  I know this is going to sound crazy but watching the end of the movie I was a bit teary like I was as I read the book. To see it  come to life on film made it so much more enjoyable. You really feel Bella's love for Edward and her unborn child as she would do or give up anything to protect them but also her struggle with losing everything in her human life. What more can I say? Can't wait to get this so that I can watch it as many times as I read the books.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun games especially for passing time. The levels can be a little bit hard as you go along. The instructions on some levels are hard to understand too. overall though they are fun little games.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|A horrid film, bad voice acting, terrible graphics.  Would not watch again and would never, ever buy.  I will tell all my friends to never watch another terrible movie like this, ever.  THIS movie was made by an art school graduate.  Worthless. Hell on plastic,
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|There are sometimes that people should quit while they're ahead! The first movie was decent, but the second one is trash. Waste of money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. it is fun and keeps me busy when I have.nothing to do :)  so buy this game
B0055SWM08|5.0|Relaxing experiance. Takes some thought. Soothing music to go with it. I am enjoying this, I think you will, also.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie was incredibly redundant, it's supposed to be a children's movie yet when me and my kids went to see it, we all were not impressed. The penguins weren't even cute!!! I really do not recommend this film.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very addcting I sent hours on this and always found it quite entertaining even my kids love it.  sometime we argue over who will get to play next
