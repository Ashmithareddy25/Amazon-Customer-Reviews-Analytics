B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Beats all horror flicks out there. This show is excellent. I have very little time for TV because of my job and my little one. I only watch two TV series...the walking dead and this one. This psychosexual thriller is pure evil and very well done ! I started watching it because of the amazing amount of 5 star reviews. Boy....they were not kidding. EXCELLENT stuff.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The divergent trilogy is so amazing and I just can't get over the ending of this book THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS DO DON'T READ IT IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED ALLEGIANT. Ok what I would like to talk about the ending. I think it was very brave of Veronica to end the book this way. I also think she was trying to get a message across that not every heroine can survive. It's not like Tris just died out of the blue. She died for a good cause, she saved many people in doing so and AUGHHHH DAVID YOU GO DIE TOO PLEASE. At first I was so excited about the switching perspectives between Tris and Tobias, but now I know why she had to do that. I also think that Tris goin mg into the weapons lab to save Caleb was symbolic that she did not change. Her while character kind of boils down to an action by the selfless little Abnegation girl an be there is almost no other way Veronica could have portrayed that. I really loved the way Veronica wrote about Tris's death, and don't take that the wrong way. But it was so touching the way she said how she felt her mother pulling her into her embrace and I think that we all know that Tris's mom dies, and is bed beckoning Tris into heaven with her, that was really sad and touching to me. Also when Tobias flashes back to the first time he saw Tris once he knows that she is dead. That was really powerful. I totally cried in this book I hope that isn't bad it was just so sad but I can understand why Veronica wrote it like that and respect her for doing that. Oh and one more thing. Before I read th he book all of my friends were saying \\"oh there will be another book don't worry it might be a false ending\\" because believe me that has happened in los of series. Veronica made it very clear that this is the LAST BOOK IN THE SERIES. Okay I have no more to say. Be prepared to cry because it is very sad but the most amazing book I have ever read. Here's to you Veronica Roth, for the best books ever *hunger games respect gesture*  Be mended, my friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Because it challenges you to observe, to think and move quickly. It keeps you interested until it locks you out.
B001QB9H10|4.0|The entire series is action packed and Stathum does a great job in all of them. Still waiting for No. 4.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I'm so excited to be getting this set. If you were to purchase each individual season, at about $20.00 or more a piece, you would spend close to $200.00.<br /><br />I consider myself a younger fan of Peter Falk. He was an adorable man and really fun actor to just sit and listen to. I have to admit, I did cry a little when he passed away.<br /><br />From his earliest movies to his very last Columbo, and the few movies he did beyond that, he is an actor that should be adored and cherished.
B000MV8ABS|4.0|This is one scary-ass movie that I would not recommend you showing to children. One of my favorites from that era.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so amazing and I was so into it. I just loved it..... It was so amazingly written and put together.
B001AITGWE|5.0|This is a fantastic movie portraying what is all too common in society today; road rage. Michael Douglas does a fabulous job losing control of everything he had in life.
B0055OMBIU|5.0|I LOVE these puzzles.  I've done London and have Paris waiting for the bad weather to come!  They are both challenging, educational - even my British husband was fascinated by the historical London underlay - and eNORmous fun!  Great gift, too, for any world traveler friends!  London was so beautiful when I finished it, I put pictures on FB to the raves of all viewers!  Try one, you'll love it!
B004XVMCN0|5.0|This movie is freaky as hell. It's the reason I purchased the two sequels. I loved this one and the mimic scared the crap out of me.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan's voice has from the first time of hearing it, been addictive to me. This CD does not disappoint and I marvel at her artistry. The songs are what we look for on a Christmas CD, plus some that are not as familiar. I Believe In Father Christmas and The Christmas Waltz were two that were a little unfamiliar, but are really beautiful. When A Child Is Born with Mathis brought tears to my eyes the first time I heard it. That first verse that Susan leads out with is just pure heaven. What more can I say, except this will be played in our house many times.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|Not what I expected. I thought it would live up to the first one but it fell short. The first half hour really dragged.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I think this is an album representing what Christmas means to Susan.  As listeners, we may or may not agree because Christmas is different to everyone.  Personally, my Christmas is different, but I chose to be respectful of what hers is to her.<br /><br />I thought the songs that were chosen were lovely.  I've always been an Elvis fan and thought O Come All Ye Faithful turned out quite well and especially liked the children singing along.  But, my favorite duet was really When a Child Is Born with Johnny Mathis.  I wasn't familiar with this song, so to me it was new, and I thought Susan and Johnny's voices blended especially well together.  I had never heard I Believe In Father Christmas before either and I liked it's veiled message and general charm.  I was also unfamiliar with In The Bleak Midwinter -- but what a beautiful song!<br />Miracle Hymn, an original song written for The Christmas Candle, is the type of song that sticks in a person's head and you can find yourself humming it when you least expect it.  So, one original song, and three others that might as well have been originals, because they were new to me.  In my opinion this is the best version of Little Drummer Boy I've heard.  The drums and bagpipes as the music mounts is magnificent...and then it ends so quietly.  Love Susan's take on the rest of the traditional Christmas songs.<br /><br />Susan has worked hard on her voice and it shows in how beautifully crafted each of these songs is.  I hope this album will find its way into many homes this holiday season and become a part of many family traditions.
B001GCUO4S|5.0|Definitely the best Final Destination in the five movie series. This one will freak anyone out and keeps you jumping in your seat.
1416955070|4.0|I know most books are generally better than the movie but this is very true in this instance.  I had never heard of this series until seeing a trailer for the movie.  It peaked my interest so I decided to give it a go before going to see it in theaters.  The movie and the book seem to extremely different.  Like one of those terrible horror movies that claims to be based on true events.  The movie was not terrible they were just seemed very far off and I would deffinitely recommend the book over the movie.
B0000089A1|4.0|The Kinks were on quite a roll coming into this LP.  Four classic LPs in the previous 4 years (Face To Face, Something Else, VGPS and Arthur).  IMO, this is right up there with each of those classics, except the production quality is much improved, and the band is really tight.  It's very hard to declare a favorite among these 5 LPs; each one has so much to recommend it.  My problem with Lola is it is not remastered to even the standard of the original Reprise LP, which I still have in my collection.  These Castle/Sancuary remasters from the late 90s were inconsistant at best - some pretty good, not great, some decidedly not that great - and this ranks in the second catagory.  Compared to the LP, it really lacks presence and high end.  The rest of the prior catalog has had a serous upgrade with the Deluxe reissues; they all sound top-notch.  But this LP has not had the Deluxe reissue...why is that, I wonder?
B00CUKTG2Q|5.0|This album is solid. Franz doesn't have a bad album. In fact, they always stick to the same formula so you know what to expect. That isn't a bad thing when it sounds like this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you love horses and ever wanted to have one of your very own, this app is a good one. Only problem I am having is waiting to own all the horses available and there are many, even unicorns!
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Excellent record. I did jump on the band wagon in 2006 by purchasing their debut album which was over hyped. That being said this album shows huge growth. This album is a game changer for me. Arctic Monkeys, you caught my attention after 6 years of let down. Excellent job!
B00CL151G4|5.0|Love the interaction between the lead characters, and enjoy trying to figure out who the killer is. Would recommend this.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|A great coming-of-age story, featuring one of River Phoenix's finest roles, along with Wil Wheaton in HIS defining movie, Corey Feldman and a young, plump Jerry O'Connell.  Also turning in a fine performance is Keifer Sutherland, as usual.
B003NX75B8|5.0|Getting lost in the heads of teenage boys is scary but this book makes it a fun sweet experience.  Truly enjoyed reading it.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|The spectacular ride that began in Outview continues in Outin, and it becomes even more exhilarating. Nate is still being hunted by Lightyear, and he is faced with predictions of horrifying events for the future that he must try to prevent. The future is constantly changing with every decision, and his life and the lives of many others, including his friends', depend upon the choices they make.<br /><br />Nate also enters Outin for the first time, an amazing different dimension that is unlike anything you could ever imagine existing in our physical world. It is truly breathtaking. Legg uses words to paint a magnificent picture of Outin just as he does when describing the beauty that is on earth in our dimension.<br /><br />With the help of mystics and others in the Inner Movement, Nate tries to escape the grasp of Lightyear, while attempting to plan out how they can take it down. The story is intense, and there are some unexpected events and surprising revelations. Meanwhile, Nate is discovering more soul powers and is learning more about his past lives that may help the Inner Movement. And I kept wondering who Nate is meant to be with: Amber or Linh? Personally, I've been hoping it's Linh...<br /><br />The most pressing theme that I noticed in this book asks the question: can evil be stopped without using violence? In the real world, I don't believe that is possible. But perhaps, in Nate's world, it is.<br /><br />I am dying to know what is going to happen in the next book!
B00E0SXNE8|4.0|Very entertaining, great for all ages! I watched it with one of my grandson's when we had a sleepover. My husband actually watched it too and said it was good. He very rarely ends up watching the movies with us.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This may be my favorite Grisham novel. Jake is such a believable character as all the other protagonists. Grisham captures the history and culture of the rural South like no other. I can't wait for his next JB courtroom drama.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a heart app. really like how easy and fast it is to use. it has many cool features.  get it now

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|does not work.action to slow.picture freeze.cant keep up. can not watch any thing. please advise this man how to fix
1250037751|2.0|I considered not finishing the book, but thought it just had to get better - it did not.  Mostly I did not understand it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|How do you not love Bruno?  There's something for everyone on this album.  It's a little pop at times, but Bruno is a very talented artist and that shines through on every track.
B000IMKDPC|5.0|This is a great movie for everyone. I allowed my son to watch this because, although it is not a cartoon movie, it is pretty clean. As you get further into the series (X2 on), they start adding more violence, sexual content, etc. However, this one remains clean and suitable for older children.<br /><br />I won't talk about the plot, as that is subjective to the viewer. But overall, it is entertaining.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Couldn't stop reading it ! I watch the series Castle so I could visualize everything that was happening in my mind ! Really great book !
0385537131|5.0|THE GOOD THING:  I downloaded this book on my iPad in readiness for an upcoming trip.<br /><br />THE BAD THING:  I read the first chapter, just to make \\"sure\\".  Then I steeled myself not to read it for 4 days.......and that plan was a dismal failure.<br /><br />As many reviewers have said, the Grisham we all knew and fell in love with is back.  Wowsers, this is one great read.  Enough said!  Just buy, download, beg, borrow or steal the book, you will be glad you did.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After I started reading the book on my trip, I downloaded the audio edition on my iPod.  It's great - the characters truly come alive.  Takes me back to listening to the radio on Sunday evening with all of the scripts - lets your imagination take off.  You'll enjoy the book either way.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|The center of the case, the part that holds the dvd in place, was broken. The movie plays perfectly, and everything else was exactly what I wanted.
0316219266|1.0|Miss characterization and anything but the truth of how Amazon and its visionaries created a business that revolutionized our generation.  The author falls short on so many levels. The fact that he misrepresents individuals and never gets direct feedback from any key members of Amazon's core culture is truly a disgrace to the quest for real life knowledge.  Stone truly misleads and falsifies stories, creating a convoluted and soap opera like set of stories that is so far fetched and quite simply a waste of time to read.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|another great kids movie! we bought the collectors edition that has the digital copy so we can put it on the iPad for the girls to watch wherever we go.
0375869026|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I've recommended this book to everyone I know! It reminds you to be nice & caring to others. There are such good quotes in this book as well. It's well written & very motivating. I will be reading this again.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Great kids movie. My 3 year old loves it and i dont mind watching it over and over. Also nice that its comes in Blu Ray and DVD so i can take it in the car for her as well!
076537062X|5.0|A great book full of great depth.  I read it long ago and just watched the movie.  Well done.  I am also buying a replacement of the book as I gave my copy away.
B000IZ0KRK|1.0|Couldn't get thought the first 30 mins.... There are better ways to spend your time... Not worth the cash or time
B007PVHMCG|2.0|Bought for my son who is a minecraft and lego fan. I thought he would be really excited, but this kit was a bit of a dissapointment. Pretty small for the cost. Not my favorite lego purchase. Based on his excitement, I will not be getting the other kits.
B003ZWN7KU|4.0|Love watching them over and over. Pure enjoyment, mindless fun.You should never analyze these movies, takes away all the fun. Big fan of Mr. Romero hope he continues to make as many follow up or remakes he wants, I will always watch them. Also love the story arc's and that one follows another to continue the story, that makes it even more fun for me!
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|It does not work and I want my money back. I thought it would work with my Kindle on my Philips HDTV. It will find the TV but it wouldn't link the two together. I would like a refund.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I love this film! Had me on my seat the entire time the movie ran. I love this version better then the theater version.There was just something about this movie that made it great for me. Brad Pitt was awesome! I know some didn't like the film or some just over analyze these types of films, but this is my own opinion, and I loved it! I've already watched this 4x since purchase.  lol  Just can't get enough!  :-p<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Pitt for producing this film!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it! So much fun and variety! If you enjoy bingo you will love this game! Don 't hesitate to try it.

B005MVLI8A|5.0|Classic Music and a great price . I listen to alot of music and always love this album. I am not into heavy grunge but the lyrics are so cool
B006JSXYPA|4.0|good movie..intense 3d...i get motion sickness so some of the 3d was a little too intense,, like when they jump out of the helicopter in wing suits. Holy Bejezus!
B001IA46D8|4.0|Nice Cd good songs and i never like them when i was younger but now the are older i respect them more for what they have completed in their lives
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Very uplifting. I have a cat named  lucky and i feel the same way as the author about my cat too.Some cats can be a pain in the ass but some  are pretty cool. Like Lucky and Bob !!!!
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Very engaging read.  I thought it was more mystery than romance but very unique.  I enjoyed watching the main character &#34;come into herself.&#34;
B00170F0DE|4.0|It is easily the best spiderman movie of the trilogy. A relatively unknown actor does a great job playing Spider Man. It'll make you want to watch the other 2.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was such an intense book.  My heart was pounding through most of it.  What a sad story.  Yes, it was unrealistic but it is a work of fiction and it was a fascinating read.  I was enthralled.  I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys intense mysteries and young love.
B001LM1456|4.0|Under rated film especially since he's a huge part of the Avengers movie. A must see for any Marvel super hero fan.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one story that will lodge in your heart and sneak out every now and then when you pet a dog.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|It's been a long time since a band caught my attention the way One Republic has.  There's an exuberance there that you just don't see very often.  Smart, heartfelt, thoughtful, a genuine pleasure to listen to over and over again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is one of the  MUST HAVE apps for kindle. What I like most is full screen and we can see previous calculations. I love it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Awesome follow up read to Time To Kill.<br />John Grisham is a storyteller extraordinaire who reels the reader in immediately and does not let you put the book down.  His characters and depiction of events in and out of the courtroom are superlative.<br />How lucky are we to have Grisham clearly as one of the great writers of our time!
0788859544|5.0|My toddler grandchildren love all the Disney movies and this one was a favorite.  It came is 2 days, which made me a hero.

006202406X|1.0|(Don't read reviews if you don't want clues about the story). I rarely write reviews unless I have a strong opinion and certainly not at 11:30 at night when I am exhausted from reading and disappointment. But I am so angry right now I can't sleep and I am worried about how my daughter, who has read the first two books in this series about 10 times and has been anxiously waiting for the third, is going to handle the terrible end. This series could have been THE BEST in its genre. It is thought provoking, suspenseful, and addresses society concerns in a unique way.  Maybe the author was trying to gain a sense of realism, shock, emotion, etc but who wants to read 3 long books only to end it all with despair. I read for pleasure and to feed my brain with philosophical thoughts. This trilogy certainly did the latter but all pleasure was lost to frustration with such an unhappy result. SO DISAPPOINTED :(((<br /><br />Update: I am editing my review 2 days later after I've had time to \\"cool off.\\"  I feel like I have grieved for the past 2 days and even felt the need to warn my 13-year old daughter that something unsatisfying was going to happen in the third book.  (She has put off reading due to schoolwork and sports because she knows that she will need time to focus only on the story.)  She guessed what happens and I felt like a spoiler but I think it would be worse for her to be unprepared.  She cried, sobbed actually, and will never trust this author again...I worry she will be turned off from reading series and lack trust for any author after this.  I agreed with her and also feel betrayed.  When you make a reader fall in love with characters and a story then take that away unnecessarily I feel it is deception-forcing sorrow on the readers.  I am at least a bit comforted by many of the other reviews where people are feeling the same.  And hopeful that Roth and other authors realize the poor choice.  So have I \\"cooled off\\" and changed my mind...not a chance :(

B00ACP3OOM|5.0|Love it! I used to get so bored swimming laps. I downloaded my favorite tunes on Finis and used it for the first time last month. 45 mins past by in no time. Wish I knew about it a long time ago. I read review about how people have problem when they swim Brest stroke with it. I had no issues whatsoever with any strokes as I swim in all strokes while I do my lap swim. Volume adjustment is easy! User friendly. No issue of any kind. Great gadget.

B008JFUR10|5.0|Very entertaining movie!  Don't worry about the physics involved or that the plot line isn't oscar quality, it's just great fun entertainment with awesome visuals!  This disc is totally DEMO QUALITY and a great choice to show off a home theater!  I have a 65 inch Sony and the picture quality is stellar with no artifacts.  My subwoofer got a workout and my theater was rockin' as the robots clashed with Mega- monsters!  I love director del-Toro!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie is just a lot of fun.  It's not so serious that it can't be enjoyed if you want some comedy.  The story keeps moving and there isn't any part of this that is even slightly boring.  This has action, romance and funny moments.  Great movie to watch any time!
B001S86J0I|5.0|My review is coals to Newcastle, with hundreds of similar kudos for this very funny movie. You don't have to be a Trekkie-geek to enjoy it, but of course it helps to know the characters and typical plot lines of the TV show. No, it's not deathless art, just a heck of a good laugh.
B004SC8YB8|5.0|Rory is one of my top two favorite guitar players ever. I own just about everything he has ever recorded and am always on the lookout for out of print DVDs, CD's or new unreleased material. Deuce is one of the best Rory albums ever made.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Other reviews have said it all and made this a must have purchase. A fan since first theatrical release, ALIEN lovers can't pass this up. It's wonderful to have continuous access to this great set of films. Ripley the best female kick-ass hero ever and the Alien herself the baddest b***h in the universe. Currently watching Theatrical Releases before viewing the Director's Cuts.
B003NRWW58|4.0|People who watch Doctor Who know who Captain Jack Harkness so you know what his character is like.  This is a spin off show with more of the adult type in language, sex, and ideas.  I would pre-screen before you like the little ones watch this.  I am not comparing this to Doctor Who, which I think is a better show, but Torchwood has potential to be another great BBC show.  It takes place in our time, where Torchwood is a secret organization here to stop Alien and other strange life forms.
B004SIP9VA|5.0|Had already seen this numerous times before buying.<br />IF you haven't seen it, a must.<br />Great dancing, keep you guessing plot, humor and the always gorgeous Gere worth the purchase price.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is the most awsomest game I have ever played in my whole entiyer life and it is epic /I love the ponies
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|It is not your normal end of the World movie.  It is surprisingly good and definitely worth watching at least once.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|It's hard to read a book series that is clearly trying to develop a love story but won't remove the incredibly sick concept of the two love birds being siblings. It's just hard to read and way too frustrating. I am holding out that when they do right this love story angle that it will be epic, but right now it's just frustrating. The action is awesome but the descriptions are a bit lengthy. I frequently found myself skipping entire paragraphs of details that were wedged in the middle of important conversations because I just wanted to know what was going on in the conversation. All in all it was a great action story, but we will have to see how she writes the relationship of these characters to see if the series is truly a good series.
B000RO0ONW|5.0|Arrived quicker than expected and worked just fine.  Hubby did not put it down until he finished portal.  The savings was a nice bonus too!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  It pulls you in to this other world that starts to seem believable...Twists and unexpected turns and good ending...go King!

B000PMFTDQ|5.0|Jessye Norman brings heaven to our ears with her performance of Strauss. Many sopranos have made great recordings of the Four Last Songs. Names like Baker, Price and Te Kanawa come to mind, but none are better that Ms. Norman. Her voice has an unearthly beauty, as well as gentle power when needed. I had the distinct pleasure of hearing her in Mahler's Resurrection Symphony, with Kathleen Battle. Talk about heavenly performances! Jessye sang Urlicht (Primal Light) to perfection. Tears flowed then and now. The Farewell (Der Abschied) from Das Lied von der Erde by Mahler also comes to mind. I am now at an age where these enormously reflective pieces have deep meaning as my personal winter is at hand. The other Strauss songs on this album are also first rate. Strauss wrote his 4 last songs after WW II. Their extreme beauty is exquisitely haunting, and surpasses anything I have ever heard from contemporary \\"serious\\" composers who have access to innumerable forms of technology that should make composing easy. There are no shortcuts to genius. Beauty is always beautiful, and this recording does infinite justice to this searing form of beauty. Even if you don't think you like German Lieder, do yourself a favor and purchase this album. Heaven's Gate will open in your mind. \\"And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest\\"!

B009XIXVU6|4.0|The jumping around from different times got a little confusing at times.  Because I have American background the names of people were a little hard to read and pronounce (did a lot of guessing) and must confess my geographical knowledge of Afghanistan is a little weak but that is my fault not the author's.  For the most part I enjoyed it very much and will probably read the next offering by Hosseini.

B00CRS88IO|5.0|Damian Stevenson has created a spellbinding spy thriller true to the genre dominated by Ian Fleming in his prime. He does this by creating an unique story proposition.  He places Ian Fleming in the role of super spy, complete with non-stop action, beautiful women and high tech gadgets.<br /><br />The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armanda is a highly creative story that draws upon the historic fact that Fleming, in real life, was involved in British intelligence during WW2. Stevenson draws the reader into the story by providing great scene and character development. I started reading it early one evening and could not put it down until I finished it at 1 AM. It was well worth the loss of a few hours sleep.<br /><br />If you enjoy secret agent tales, you should pick this up today.

B005AKFXZW|1.0|Le Cirque de Reve – the Night Circus, an exotic circus open only during the hours of nightfall, a place of beauty, and wonder, and dreams made flesh. Here, the circus-goer can wander the mysterious paths between black and white striped tents, venturing into each tent as they please. Within each tent, a wonder – an illusionist, a fortune-teller, and sights even more wondrous and exotic, a garden of ice, a tree of wishes, a labyrinth of spectacular rooms, each even more fantastic and unbelievable than the last. And above all, the smell of caramel and popcorn. The Night Circus – the arena for a magical challenge.<br />Celia and Marco - unwilling antagonists in a battle of wits between their near-immortal mentors to prove one school of thought better than another. Bound to the challenge by magic, compelled to strive against one another, yet drawn to one another like moths to the flame.<br />Even now, the day after I finished the book, this is all I can tell you about the book. The story is easily summarised to a line or two, indicating a simplicity of storyline that is rare and not necessarily desirable. The scenes and individual events already blur and fade because they were part of a gradual build to the ending, rather than important events in their own right.<br />I enjoyed the destination of this book, but the journey often left me flat. Did I like Celia and Marco? In a vague, distant kind of way, yes. Do I feel I know the characters intimately, that I could tell you how they might respond in any given situation? No, not at all – in fact, if I were to describe the characters, I could only do so in vague terms. Was I invested in the outcome? Again, only in a slightly hopeful way.<br />The book is written in a peculiar fashion, utilising both second person point of view (use of ‘you’ instead of ‘I’, ‘he’, or ‘she’) and omniscient third POV (use of ‘he’ and ‘she’ in a remote fashion, where we feel the story is narrated to us and we are kept at arm’s length from the characters).<br />I detest the use of second person point of view in this book. It is used, I think, to create the sense the reader is in the circus. It irritated me, and distracted me from the story – not a good thing when I was already hardly invested in the story. Although I concede that the ending, the culmination of the use of second POV, was clever, it was not enough to compensate for its annoyances during the book. Third omniscient POV is what largely kept me from connecting with the characters. Never allowed inside the character’s heads, I never felt I got to know them, never got the chance to live and breathe their lives, their desires, and their fears.<br />The book uses present tense to compensate for the remote POV (he walks instead of he walked) but this, too is unconventional, as it often distracts the reader or creates a sense of discomfort – we are, by nature, accustomed to telling stories in past tense, even our own stories of each passing day, and use of other tenses can be an uncomfortable experience. I found it distracting and it didn’t sufficiently compensate for the POV.<br />The book also lacked conflict in my opinion. The main conflict turned out to be Celia’s and Marco’s desire to be rid of the challenge – the tension between what they must do by the rules of the game, and what they want to do. But the rules are so vague, each ‘move’ in the game so abstract (consisting mostly of each of them contributing to the circus by means of magic, adding a new tent or ‘act’ only made possible by magic), that the book is more than half over before the reader starts to gain a sense of this conflict. Other conflicts that might exist between the characters (for example, Celia and Marco’s blossoming romance, or the potential love triangle with Isobel) is negated by the use of omniscient third – we never wonder if Celia’s feelings for Marco are reciprocated because the narrator has already told us they are.<br />As a result, I found I had nothing to keep me reading except a vague curiosity in where the book was going. If I hadn’t been reading this for Club Fantasci, I may well have stopped in the first 10%. As it was, I was well past halfway before I felt I needed to read to the end. In my opinion, that is far too late.<br />My strongest reaction was early in the book to Prospero the Enchanter when he slices Celia’s fingers open in a cruel fashion to teach her to heal herself – but the impact of this, even, could have been made more immediate, and a stronger basis for the reader to identify with Celia if another POV had been used. Later, in the story, the emotional impact of this event in her life is played down.<br />The Black Moment (the moment of crisis, when the reader should catch their breath in fear and anticipation, waiting to see how terribly wrong everything has gone, and if all will be well) had me curious, but hardly emotionally invested to the point I should have been. I did foresee Celia’s plan for ending the game, and although it wasn’t what I wanted to happen, I found the most I could muster at the prospect was a mild annoyance.<br />While the story was different, novel, unique, and had a fabulous atmosphere and mood, I can only say I feel every opportunity for passion, for strong emotion, for the things readers hunger for, was missed. While I was not unhappy with the ending, this is not a story that will stay with me for years to come – or even perhaps past the week.ey are.<br />As a result, I found I had nothing to keep me reading except a vague curiosity in where the book was going.

B00A7R0JPM|3.0|Cloud Atlas is a difficult book to pin down, a difficult book to explain in any way that makes sense, and ultimately difficult to read.<br />The book is actually six intertwined stories. Each story is interrupted halfway, and each successive character, further along in history, knows something of the previous character. As the story of the last character completes, he learns the rest of the story of the character previous to him, and so on until we arrive back at the end of the first character’s story.<br />The first character is Adam Ewing, a public notary on-board a ship in the South Pacific in 1850, whose story is recorded as journal entries.<br />Robert Frobisher takes over the second story. He is a struggling bisexual musician disowned by his father in 1931 and seeking employment in Belgium with dying composer Vyvyan Ayrs. His story is told by means of letters to his old lover Rufus Sixsmith, and he mentions the discovery of half the journal of Adam Ewing.<br />Luisa Rey, a journalist in 1975, meets Rufus Sixsmith and subsequently investigates the safety of a nuclear power plant. She receives half of Frobisher’s letters from Sixsmith. Her story is told in the style of a mystery thriller.<br />Timothy Cavendish, the fourth character, is a vanity publisher in Britain in the present day, who flees his gangster creditors and is tricked by his brother into a nursing home from which he must escape. During the course of his story, he reads a book submission – Half-Lives: the First Luisa Rey Mystery.<br />The fifth character, Somni~451, is a genetically modified clone in the future. She was designed and created specifically to serve in Papa Song’s restaurants for a period of 12 years, after which each server is released to paradise in Hawaii. Clones are created specific to their role, unable to reproduce, or even think in many cases, and kept sedated and docile to serve the whims of the ‘purebloods’. This story is set in Neo So Copros, which turns out to be Korea, but the ‘corpocracy’ (corporate culture elevated to the status of religion) appears to be world-wide, with references to Africa as a ‘Production Zone’. Her story is told as the recordings of a condemned woman’s last words, and during her tale she mentions watching a film, ‘The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish’.<br />The sixth character, Zachry, exists in a post-apocalyptic world which has descended back into a largely uncivilised state with limited technological resources. Somni is the goddess to whom his people pray, and during the course of his life, he watches the recordings of Somni’s last words and learns the truth about her. It is at the end of his tale, when he sits down to watch the last half of Somni’s tale, that the order of stories reverses.<br />While this is clever, and well-executed, and each character has their own distinct voice and way of speaking, it also doesn’t make for the easiest read. Adam Ewing uses the dialect of the time, making it hard to read and difficult to engage. As the first story, it made it difficult for me to get into the book. The last character, Zachry, also uses a distorted version of our language and this was extremely difficult for me to understand at first, although I found eventually my brain became accustomed to it and read it easily.<br />Once I moved on to Frobisher’s letters, I was far more engaged in the story and keen to keep reading, but each story broke off at a critical point. While this is a common technique to hook the reader, in this case I didn’t know if I was ever going to come back to that character, and I was reluctant to engage with the next character. By the time I came back to each story, particular Frobisher and Ewing, I found I couldn’t even recall what had happened.<br />The prose is flawless, but perhaps too obviously so, remaining in the foreground to flaunt itself rather than fading invisibly into the background and leaving the reader to enjoy the story. As for enjoying the story, while I did enjoy it, not as much as I could have done. Some of the characters are obviously doomed from the beginning, making it difficult to really commit to that character, and ultimately I found I didn’t care about their ends.<br />Part of that, I think, is that the book isn’t obviously about anything. After some thought, I had to conclude that what the book was about was the human predilection to violence and selfishness at the expense of our fellows. A worthy topic, but hardly one that inspires enjoyment. A story should be about its characters, so the reader connects with them, empathises with them, and cheers them on.<br />Many other speculative fiction books deal with difficult topics – Pratchett, for example, deals with racism through the device of speciesism in the city of Ankh-Morpork and specifically the issue of which species can apply to be in the City Watch. But never would anyone pick up a Discworld book and declare ‘this book is about racism’. Because it’s not, it’s about the characters, with themes of racism. Cloud Atlas, however, is about its themes, because the stories are only incidental to the theme. The characters and their ends are not important in and of themselves, but only as a means to make a point.<br />I’m not saying the book isn’t well-written. It is, impressively so, and the author pulls of literary feats that are technically awesome. I’m not saying the book isn’t enjoyable. It is, and I did, but perhaps not in the same way that I enjoy my favourites.<br />However, I do believe the book was written for a very select audience, and if you’re not part of that audience, you might not appreciate this book. I don’t believe I’m part of that audience, and while the book was generally enjoyable, perhaps not enough to make up for the effort required to read it.njoying the story, while I did enjoy it, not as much as I could have done.

B005FVNIW6|4.0|What would you do if the fate of the world hung on a child, aged six? Would you make the hard decisions to subject the child to the trials necessary to give that child the capabilities, together with natural intelligence, to actually save the world? Could you?<br />Earth has been twice invaded by giant insectoid aliens. Casualties were horrific. We were outnumbered and outgunned. The first time we nearly lost. The second time we were saved by the genius tactician Mazer Rackham. Now we are preparing for the third invasion, and while our technology has advanced, so will have the ‘buggers’. Our hopes rest on a pre-emptive strike to the buggers’ homeworld, but we have no commander.<br />Ender is a Third – a third child in a world where couples are allowed only two. The government had great hopes for his older brother, Peter, but found him too cruel, too ambitious, to lead their fleet. Their hopes switched to his sister, but she was too gentle, and so, in hopes of a child with the qualities of both Peter and Valentine, the government authorised the birth of Ender.<br />Monitored almost since birth, Ender is taken from his parents at the age of six and sent to a school for talented children destined for great careers in the space fleet. While they make no secret of the fact they hope he will command the fleet in the attack against the buggers’ homeworld, Ender is subjected to incredible pressure in order to force him to learn to think his way out of almost any impossible scenario.<br />The majority of the training at the Battle School is mock training in zero gravity conditions between groups of other students, where tactics more than brute strength rule the day. Isolated, friendless, and made a target for bullies, Ender nevertheless demonstrates his ability to outthink almost any adversary, defeating enemies or making them his allies. Each time he rises to the top, the instructors change the odds, change the stakes, and make the situation almost impossible for him to win.<br />He is advanced ahead of his age, made to prove his value to the older students, and then, when he does, he inevitably alienates some. When he gains acceptance, he is pulled out of his unit, made the commander of his own unit, and left to sink or swim with too many rookie ‘soldiers’. When he nevertheless turns them into an effective fighting force, the odds are stacked against him when the instructors stage daily battles, and then twice daily battles, instead of allowing the usual rest period.<br />While the training seems nothing short of cruel, and some of the instructors express concerns they may ‘break’ or ‘ruin’ Ender, if one looks closely you realise that the training is nothing more or less than actual simulated battle conditions. There is no mandatory rest period between battles in war. There is no guarantee that one will always have the upper hand, or that one will always have the best soldiers. A commander must make the most of what he has to still produce victory, and it is this for which Ender is actually being trained.<br />Will he succeed? At the age of eleven, is he capable of leading a space fleet to war… and winning? Should he even be placed in that position, made responsible for the lives of soldiers? While I, as a mother, mourn the loss of the childhood he never had, I can recognise that Ender’s youth makes him more flexible, more durable, than an adult might be. He comes with no pre-conceptions, no skills or beliefs to be unlearned, and has that resilience so common to children. While an adult might break under the pressure, a child may only bend, and so Ender bends, and is moulded into the tool that is needed.<br />But the moral question remains. Should a child be taken and moulded into a tool, at great personal expense of that child? Can such actions be justified to save the whole of humanity?<br />Maybe.<br />But what if you don’t even know if the enemy is coming? What if, maybe, the enemy has learned the error of its ways and has no intention of invading and attacking enemy space? What if it is now us who are the invaders?<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the direction in which the book led me, the questions it posed, and sharing Ender’s journey and personal dilemmas. While the book is written, at times, ‘simplistically’, and employs ‘telling’ in some cases instead of ‘showing’, it appears from the introduction that Orson Scott Card did this deliberately, believing it made the book more accessible to a wider audience. Perhaps he was right, and perhaps the style of narrative was appropriate for a protagonist aged between six and eleven anyway.<br />While not the usual type of book I read, I ripped through Ender’s Game in two days, and I’m looking forward to the opportunity to read more in the Ender series in the near future. Highly recommended.r of its ways and has no intention of invading and attacking enemy space?

Wonderfully written short stories, made extremely hilarious through the use of witty hyperbole.  Highly quotable.
B00ELD19OI|5.0|I had never heard Haken before this album.  Quite frankly, on first listen of the early-released song \\"Atlas Stone\\" I wasn't hooked on it and sort of brushed it aside in my mind.  However, after reading a few reviews of the album, I decided to give The Mountain another look.  Please don't think I'm a total poseur, but one of the reviews I had read offered a comparison to Dream Theater (one of my all time faves) and this particular reviewer made the case that Haken was magnificently wonderful while Dream Theater was stuck in \\"nineteen eighty boring.\\"  Now that kind of talk got me wondering and lead me to check out the album one late night, just me relaxing with my headphones.  Ultimately, I'm not looking at comparing the two, because while Dream Theater's S/T album (also incredible)had been released around the same time as this, and the comparisons are inevitable, Haken has truly created something wonderful here.  No matter your reasons for checking it out, you owe it to yourself to get a copy of The Mountain, a good pair of headphones, and give this a thorough listen repeatedly, start to finish whenever possible.<br /><br />The Mountain is a prog metal journey meant to be listened to from the beginning, in this case \\"The Path\\" which is a soft vocal/key track that prepares you for the wonders to follow...the musical theme here is repeated periodically during the album's hour-long course.  It's almost church hymn-like.  This leads into the explosive \\"Atlas Stone,\\" which is a song that totally embodies The Mountain's cover art.  \\"Carry the weight of the world on my shoulders!\\"  It is on this song where perhaps the Dream Theater comparison sneaks in, as the guitar solos are straight-up Petrucci, but that's really about it.  During the course of \\"Atlas Stone\\" Haken show off plenty, but are under control 100% of the time as they shift styles.  It became apparent early in the album that unlike a lot of prog-metal bands, Haken place heavy emphasis on their vocal attack.  The melodies these guys come up with through voice as well as through their instruments are as jaw dropping as the guitar riffs and the off-the-wall keyboards.<br /><br />But if you think you've figured out Haken through \\"Atlas Stone\\" you are mistaken, as they follow up that song with the even more insane \\"Cockroach King.\\"  This particular track is lyrically all about anti-establishment, anti-greed, and musically Haken aren't afraid to test the patience of anyone without an open mind.  Again with the layered vocal attack to start, the song progresses through a dark-jazzy interlude, a majestic chorus, and then a crazy bridge section that at times calls to mind Primus in spots, video games in others but with an atonal melody hook that really makes me feel like there are cockroaches scurrying around on the wall. The song seriously sounds like what the Muppets would make if they made a prog-metal song...much to Haken's genius they went and made a video for \\"Cockroach King\\" featuring the band as Muppets and a not so subtle nod to Queen...check it out on the youtube if you haven't already.<br /><br />From there, Haken aren't done showing you what they're capable of.  \\"In Memoriam\\" is a shorter track focused more on heavy extended-range guitars...I had to pick my jaw up off the floor when Haken launched into a Meshuggah-like breakdown, and the frantic staccato progression that carries the tune through the end had me reeling.  Afterward, \\"Because it's There\\" brings back the theme from \\"The Path,\\" but this time with full instrumentation, and serves up inspiration for anyone that's looking to either climb The Mountain or else overcome life's challenges....uplifting for sure.<br /><br />Rounding out the album are epic-length tracks \\"Falling Back to Earth,\\" \\"Pareidolia,\\" and the somber \\"Somebody\\" with another short interlude \\"As Death Embraces\\" in between.  I will stop short of describing each of these songs in detail, other than to say that each is an appropriate, engrossing piece of the puzzle that is The Mountain, and I was reminded of Opeth's finer moments more than once.<br /><br />In the end, plenty of ear candy for the prog metal fan, lots of sounds to discover with repeated listens, but also huge ear-worms that you will hum all day, even after listening to other albums.  I can't recommend this album enough to any prog rock/metal fan, and believe it, for somebody who's favorite metal subgenre is death metal, this album is at the top of the heap for my 2013 listening, easily.ce of the puzzle that is The Mountain, and I was reminded of Opeth's finer moments more than once.<br /><br />In the end, plenty of ear candy for the prog metal fan, lots of sounds to discover with repeated listens, but also huge ear-worms that you will hum all day, even after listening to other albums.

The suspense never ends and keeps you from putting the book down. This is an edge-of-your-seat thriller the whole way through, with a capital `A' Amazing ending. You should read this because it has a perfect blend of action, humor, world building, plot, and just a  touch of romance. Readers will laugh out loud at the quirky characters. Steelheart is a great book for Young Adult to Adult audiences.
B007VGXS8M|4.0|It will take a little bit longer to load but its worth your money! At some levels you might need to look A LOT HARDER to find but hes there!
B00479SVBU|5.0|I've tried RF audio input devices before and as with most others experience with adapters they work fine if you stay within a medium sized city or town. But if you're traveling outside those boundaries you run into radio stations that are using the channel you've tuned your FM adapter to and you have to stop and hopefully find an unused channel that your FM adapter's limited selection of channels can utilize. The Soundfly can be tuned through the entire FM band at the rate of .1 mhz at a time. But better yet this FM adapter seems to have a higher power output and has a lot less trouble over powering intruding radio stations. I only use this for external mp3 players and I haven't tried playing mp3s directly from SD cards so I can't comment on that.<br /><br />  If you buy one of these and are experiencing hissing or buzzing when using it with a separate audio device I found that a ground loop isolater ([[ASIN:B001EAQTRI B001EAQTRI]] will resolve this.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love the song 22. I am 22 years old myself and I fond myself relating to so many of the lyrics in this song.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|At the beginning, I felt like the book was a little slow. I guess that was just the build-up. I lived the book. I liked how the characters evolve throughout the story and also the end of the book was touching. Definitely can't wait to start the new book!
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|This game is amazing the only problem I have is that  you have to wait 10 minutes to get energy which you need for the game to hunt if they time to 5 at least I d give it5. Stars
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game to play to unwind after a long day at work.  Easy to play, no complicated rules, it's great.  I can't wait to get home to play.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So amazing! The love and hate relationship and emotions really shined between the lines in the book. I could really feel the nervous feeling the main character felt in the book. Switching characters was the best, and getting the point of view from all of them was a blast. So if one of my friends asked for a book suggestion, I would say, Wonder.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app has been a joy to use.  I quickly find out definitions and pronunciations of words easily making this an app favorite.  There are many more features available that makes this one of the best on the market.  You will not be disappointed!
B009SJ46EA|5.0|I absolutely LOVE American Horror Story.  The first season is my favorite by far, but the second season was good.  The third season is shaping up to be great too !!
B006671NPM|5.0|Arrived as expected and exactly as described.  No problems at all.  Very satisfied, would order, again, if I needed more! :)
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I read it when I was young and then again as an adult.  I've feared clowns ever since the movie Poltergeist so this just psychologically thrilled/scared me.  I constantly look for stuff to scare me and not much does.<br /><br />Even if you aren't afraid of clowns, this book has a TON of creepiness to it.  It's a must read !!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy HAPPY HAPPY that I can finally play candy crush on my kindle fire!!!! And I can keep the same level that I'm on on Facebook and my iPhone!!!!
B00899EOIS|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this show.  I love all the &#34;liars&#34; and I especially love Toby.  The story just keeps getting more and more twisted.
B00DXPC1U6|1.0|I don't understand why would they do an ending like this for the series , even Michael C. hall agrees ,even I could've done a better ending for Christ sake, I'm really disappointed that they decided to go that way. I hope they make a director's cut or a movie or SOMETHING! ....because that wasn't a fitting ending for such series.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|This movie didn't attract a popular response when it came out in theaters.  But it's a reasonably accurate and compelling look at a world pandemic…the challenges of containing it, the public hysteria and response, how social order breaks down or people bend the rules to protect those they love.  No car chases, hot sex, gun battles or dramatic court scenes in this movie.  Some of the &#34;good guys&#34; don't make it out alive.  There is almost no-one who is purely good or bad in this movie.  But it's pretty accurate and also entertaining.  And for those looking for a kid or family friendly movie, while you see some events (a mother crashing and dying before her young son, an implied affair), there is no sex, no nudity, no graphic deaths by gunshot or dismemberment, no excessive violence.  It's a serious topic with tragedy and loss of loved ones.  But for a subject that can be a bit scary and grim, it's a good family movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So fun I play it when I get bored<br />Like to night it's 10:09 pm and I'm bored<br />Wish I had more coins
0470932139|4.0|This is one of my favorite books on food photography.  First, the author is more of an artist that a technical specialist as a photographer.  So while the book covers some technical details, you may want more than what she has to offer or may at times have problems with some of the details.  Second, the examples in the book are excellent and you'll clearly come away understanding how important good, soft, moderated light is to good food photography.  Third, you'll also get a very good sense of composition…this is one of the things that sets apart an amateur taking a picture of a tasty dish versus someone creating a picture that looks appetizing.  Finally, the book is decidedly &#34;low-tech&#34; and utilizes a range of simple techniques to produce good results.  For an intro to food photography, this is an excellent book to start with.  You won't be overwhelmed with details and you'll get some clear lessons (and examples) of how to create beautiful food photographs in your home or kitchen.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the game because it test your skills of knowledge and memory. What I don't like is the pop up asking you to buy more time are to buy something to help you get to the next level.
B00DB2JQ7W|4.0|It's good to see Gov't Mule trying to get back to their roots. Yes, they still perform a few Bob Marley influenced songs; but this chapter also lends itself to the 'Deja Voodoo' days. The bass lines are solid, something that hasn't been heard since Mr. Woody died; Danny Louis provides more than adequate keyboards; Matt is still... well, still Matt; and really no words can describe Warren's guitar and vocals, so I won't try.<br />The CD comes in duplicate form, with the second version highlighting well-known musical guests.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|I use it every day, avery time. Saves me time and money. I can find everything in a country without addresses (Costa Rica)
B00867GJYK|5.0|I always loved this movie as a kid and I still love it now that I am older. The story follows the journey of a father and a son, both clownfish and live in the great blue sea. After losing his wife and many children by a bigger fish, Marlin, has become extremely protective over Nemo. This story is about the struggle the father has over letting his son do bigger things while the son realizes his father is more of a role model than he realized he could be. Albert Brooks and Alexander Gould do a wonderful tag team and make you feel for both characters. Disney and Pixar did an amazing job creating both characters along with the forgetful Dory. Her song, Just Keep Swimming, will not only make you smile but stick in your head for hours afterwards.
0618154248|1.0|These are not the Curious George stories!!  The illustrations are by H.A. Rey, but the words are not, and they are horrible.  I was so disappointed and feel really deceived.  I would never have spent $14+ on this set, had I known that it was not the actual stories.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|personally gratifying. absolutely awesome.stunningly beautiful. easy to play and wonderfully colorful. the things that you have to do are funny and whimsical.
B00DJ80VLS|1.0|Long time DT fan since Images and Words and I think I have everything they've ever recorded including some of their official bootleg stuff.<br />The overall mix on this is HORRIBLE. Is it compressed? don't know, but everything combined sounds like one big frequency with no lows, no separation of any instruments and the drums...where the hell are the DRUMS?<br />They sound like some tinny little drum kit with absolutely no bass drum or crispy highs.<br />I realize Mangini plays differently than MP but c'mon, why in the heck is he mixed so low in the mix?<br /><br />And before anyone says it's my stereo, I'm using a Technics 120W amp with JBL500 tower speakers.<br />For fun we put on another DT cd to compare and the mix is like a window opened. Good separation in the mix between synth, drum, bass, guitar and vocals. Nice bottom end, mids and highs.<br /><br />Overall, I think the music and writing lacks passion and feeling. Technique wise, yes, this is Dream Theater but I don't hear any heart and soul in their music here.<br /><br />I thought Mike Mangini would bring positive change with him, but either his drums weren't mixed right or he just doesn't fit the music.<br />For gosh sake, you're a progressive metal band, mix the drums so they kick ass will ya?<br /><br />I've tried repeated listens on different days and can't even get through this cd. I'm giving it away if I can.<br />After all these years of enjoying DT, it's sad to end it this way.<br />Maybe I have a funky cd, anyone hear of some bad ones being released?<br /><br />I know Richard Chycki comes with great cred but I'm not hearing it here.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game classic with all the heart stopping action from your childhood. Great game for the kids too. Fun for everyone!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is fun and addictive. It is family friendly. My three year old loves to help feed the animals and collect the coins. It is frustrating when the upgrades cause glitches to the game, but stick with it. The issues usually work themselves out in a few weeks.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game it is just like must or riven. I was never any good at those games though so I'm happy this one has hints if I need them. If you want the game to last longer, Don't use them. Very fun, worth the money.
B00FT1CZ3K|5.0|The recordings on this double CD collection are The Beatles during the early part of their career as Beatlemania was just starting to explode in Great Britain and before the four lads took over the United States by storm. Best of all these are live recordings, not studio recordings, that occurred during performances The Beatles made while on the radio on the BBC, aka the British Broadcasting Company. By the time that The Beatles made their appearances on the BBC they were already collecting a fan base of wildly enthusiastic kids who were falling in love with the music as well as with John, Paul, George and Ringo. This is by far the best collection I feel of the early Beatles as they were still developing their style and sound of music. The majority of the songs on these two discs are their covers of songs written by other great rock and roll performers especially on disc 1 with songs written by Little Richard, Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry among others. Most of the songs on the second disc include songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney as they began to get serious in developing their writing skills and performing more of their own songs. Also on the second disc covers the Beatles period after their first successful visit of the U.S. and the release of their first movie &#34;A Hard Days Night&#34;. All together both CDs cover the period for the Beatles from 1962 to 1965. In addition to the music throughout the recordings are brief snippets of the lads talking with the different BBC hosts of the radio shows The Beatles appeared on. It gives good examples of the wit and humor the Beatles would come to be known for and the charm they had. For the serious fan of the Fab Four I highly recommend this album. It is a must to include in your Beatles library.
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|I downloaded this when my niece was coming to play so she would have something to do. She couldn't really do anything without me buying the game/add-ons to the game.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|Better than the 1st season, which set up the story.  Too bad it didn't get to go all 5 years.  That would be really interesting.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Perfect! I am so happy I bought this, now I can have Mad Men marathons as often as I want.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A bit addicting.  This game is challenging, but not too frustrating.  Sometimes just need to use a little common sense, and realize that not everything is a clue.  Can't wait for more rooms to escape.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever!  Cannot stop playing and love helping other players and other players helping me out!  Fun fun fun!
B0094D462M|5.0|Always a good watch! Classic! Love the volleyball scene, but who doesn't? If you haven't watched once before, definitely a must watch!

B00ERIUO02|4.0|I must admit that I've never really been a Katy Perry fan, I'm more of a John Mayer fan who found her by association.  Over the past year or so, I've come to respect her music and her role as a pop queen who is adored by multitudes of fans... most of them quite a bit younger than I.  I've discovered that aside from the fact that her music isn't the kind I would listen to regularly, she does have one of the best and most beautiful voices on the music scene today.  I hope that in the coming years, her music develops into the kind that I would listen to (e.g., \\"Who You Love,\\" on John Mayer's \\"Paradise Valley\\" album).<br /><br />That said, I listened to this album the other night for the first time, and was impressed.  I think you should give it a chance.  This album is way more about the joy she has now than about the breakup.  Although I wish the darker, Russell Brand inspired songs weren't on the album, I understand that she had to address that part of her life in order to move on.  And move on, she has.  So many of the songs on the album are more about the happiness she has found in her love and new life with John Mayer.  The two of them are obviously deeply in love, and it shows on both of their faces and in their music.  If you give it a chance, you'll see that.<br /><br />The music itself is sophisticated and fun.  Still not my style for regular listening, but I'd put it on at a party.  I know that legions of young KatyCats are going to hate me for saying this, but I'm waitin' on the day when she'll do more grown up music that will showcase her vocals a lot more.  Oh yah baby... just those beautiful vocals accompanied by John's guitar and background vocals... THAT would be my \\"go to\\" album for sure!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I Like it very much not to easy not to hard, good graphics, the controls are not to bad either.

1400082773|5.0|Dreams From my Father is a book that I find very interesting and intriguing on account of learning about a very significant American figure. This book thoroughly displays the oh so riveting life experience of Barack Obama, and opens up many different thoughts within your mind, which for me, not a lot of books can do. Dreams From my Father is able to inspire the reader in a unique way, and capture the attention of the reader with many different techniques. Through Barack Obama's analysis of each character, the reader is able to perceive various characters in a similar way that Barack Obama did, thus granting the audience a personal connection to the writer. To truly capture this books central message, we have to set aside who the author has become over the years. This book was written by a 34-year-old Barack Obama who simply wanted to express who he is and what shaped his life to who Barack Obama is. Whether you favor Obama's political stance or not, I highly suggest this book. If this book does not sound appealing to you, look beyond politics, beyond the fact that Barack Obama is the current president, for this book can make anyone think and can inspire all.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Thought It was pretty nifty game. My younger sister loves it. I wish the horses were not so much and the time limit wait for things aren't as long because I basically have to wait a day or more to do anything.

B00EBJ624O|5.0|Yuja Wang's virtuostic devouring of Prokofiev's Second Piano Concerto is a revelation even for someone like me, who loves this piece and has listened to countless recordings over the years. Another delight is the conducting of Dudamel (of whom I'm not the greatest fan) who in this performance proves to be perfectly simpatico with his soloist. The phrasing and dynamics of Wang and orchestra are matched flawlessly, resulting in a dazzling momentum that nonetheless captures every element of musicality that the score demands. At times I had to marvel that things did not careen out of control. Wang's playing shows an incredible mastery over phrasing and dynamics. The notes are not only all in their proper place, they are given that sense of meaning and inevitability that underlies all great music.<br /><br />This is not to say that this is a breakneck interpretation -- there are indeed the proper moments of repose. But wow, when this piece calls for pianistic chops, Wang delivers. The first movement cadenza is as good as it gets -- as I listened I kept thinking, how could any mortal be able to compose music like this, and how could any pianist be able to so completely play the living daylights out of it? The orchestra's reentry afterward is absolutely shattering, as it should be. At the end of Movement One it was so exciting to know that three more from this team were yet to come!<br /><br />Yuja Wang is a Prokofiev pianist for the ages. I dearly hope that she will record the other concertos with Dudamel. I sense that it would be a benchmark set.<br /><br />I liked the Rachmaninov as well but the five stars here are for the Prokofiev, which belongs in the collection of anyone who appreciates this composer.
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|With the release of the highly anticipated sequel already upon us, I felt it to be practically necessary to do a review on the movie Thor.<br /><br />I am familar with different cultural mythology, so I have heard of Thor. And I remember 2011 well; mainly because I expected Captain America to be better than Thor. Captain America was a good movie, but after viewing Thor for the first time, I had to go back and read some of the comics. Yes, as an adaptation and a  movie, Thor delivers all the goods.<br /><br />Thor stars Chris Hemsworth as the man himself, with a supporting cast that consists of:  Anthony Hopkins,  Kat Dennings, Idris Elba, Natalie Portman, Jamie Alexander, to name a few. Also starring in the villainous role, Tom Hiddleston playing Loki. I won' t say he stole the show; only because I feel each person played his/her part well, but he did a really awesome job playing Loki. Between Tom Hiddleston, Michael Fassbender, and Benedict Cumberbatch, I simply can't decide who plays the better villain. But the acting in Thor is great.<br /><br />The set designs and costumes/makeup in Thor (example: Frost Giants) were well drawn/set up. And the CGI is pretty good as well.<br /><br />The story is also well executed. It is not as complex as one might think , so it is easy to enjoy, not just for the eye candy ladies (and you too gentlemen) but because Thor does justice not just to Thor the hero, but to Thor as the god of thunder.<br /><br />If you like movies with superheroes and you have not yet seen Thor, go watch it. It proves to be a solid outing from Marvel Studios.<br /><br />8.6/10<br /><br />Thor the Dark World: November 8, 2013<br />Avengers Age of Ultron: May 1, 2015
B005C0DHEY|5.0|What Josh Fox brings to light in his documentary brings great sadness to my heart. I grew up in Wyoming and the thought that fracking is destroying this beautiful state (and many others) disturbs me on so many levels. Josh presents the facts (and you can check them yourself if you so desire) in such a plain, simple, understandable and well-illustrated way that I could not take my eyes from the screen. Many times I had to replay parts of the video because I couldn't believe how deep this corruption goes (no pun intended). Comparing what big oil companies are doing today with what big tobacco companies did decades ago, is genius! Fracking and smoking are safe! Ha!! I've also watched GasLand II, and anything else I find about this subject. The fracking issue is on the ballots here in Colorado as I write this and I pray the BOCs will not be allowed to tear up our landscapes, kill our wildlife, poison our air and water, and ultimately, lead us all down the path to Armageddon, all on the pretense that this is the safe and best answer to our energy problems.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|It was absolutely worth the waiting! The album is a marvelous piece that will immediately touch your heart.<br />Very powerful songs and interpretations  from Ms Dion, with a different touch. She sounds so good and at times so opposite from her trademark &#34;powerful&#34; ballads it makes you doubt if it's her singing...<br />Very difficult to choose a favorite song but I've already listen to &#34;Didn't know love&#34;  &#34;At seventeen&#34; and &#34;Water and a flame&#34; more than 3 times.<br />Overall a great experience you can enjoy from track 1 to 13 (over and over) without skipping songs.<br />Thanks Celine!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh. My.  I loved this book. I was afraid to read it. Everyone talking about how much they cried put me off. But I dove in and I'm so glad I did. I love the main characters. They're so smart and relatable. I did cry, but it is such a good book, I'd read it again and cry again. Beautifully done, John Green.

Stick to basket ball or tennis one of those non likable sports by any cool person (well,tennis is cool) any way thats my review wish they would do that then this game would be a killer game still cool as it is love it. Hate people who hate it. Buy now. oh creators make mini got a 1+2  4 kindle fire pleaze thanks.  Sincerly,epicunicorn57

0486236951|1.0|Needlework is a passion of mine. I have discovered many beautiful patterns that are breathtaking and I had hoped this book would give me more of the same. This book disappointed me as the patterns were very simple, basic, and gave no instructions. I don't know if I will use this book at all.
B000AQJPQE|1.0|We bought this toy for a grandchild's room based on the picture and description on the packaging. The recommendation is that you turn off the room lights before turning on the toy. If you want to see the \\"light up\\" sun, then turning the room lights off are a necessity, it just just barely glows and you cannot see the planets in the dark. Also when we turned on the planets' movement we could hear a whine from the motor in the unit and it would not make a complete revolution before locking up and hearing the gears clicking. In order to get the movement to work I had to take the unit back down and spray WD40 on it before it would make a complete revolution. The motor still whines. Since we had to make two holes in the ceiling to mount it originally, I put it back up and will just have to live with the piece of junk until I am ready to repair and repaint the ceiling. Please do not waste your money and time by buying this toy.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I purely love this game. The cost for extra bots/byor is annoying, make it free and you will get many buys
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm not the type of person who reads 50 novels a year.  I'm not a professional critic.  These are just my \\"regular guy\\" opinions.  Some spoilers..<br /><br />Excellent writing.  I felt like i was living in the silo.  The novel read somewhat like a movie.  I did not find myself looking for any sort of deeper meanings or artistic interpretation after finishing it.  Hard to put down.  i think i read it in 3 sittings.  A few cons...<br /> Like someone else said, the story was somewhat depressing.  Not a tragedy per se, but lots of tragic elements.  Just not my flavor.  The author would build a character, only to kill him or her, then start building someone else..  It was choppy.  This may be only an issue if your a geek- if they were somewhat limited down there, how did IT manufacture those ultra high res displays for the suits?  I feel like the ending was rushed.  It left you hanging a little bit..  Did Jules go back to the silo with the kids?  Or at least say, \\"hey I'm ok.\\"
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think that this book is the perfect choice for a dictionary because it has a lot of pages and it has wonderful definitions.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I already did all the quests they give you. Please add more. I absolutely love this game!!!!! I play it daily!!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Great calculator, big buttons, and great display that is easy to read and the big buttons help eliminate typo errors.
0062215507|5.0|My daughter loved the original and this revised version is even better.  Full of fun stuff to read and do for H. Potter fans.
B00DJ3ITKS|5.0|This is a superb book, very well written.  Bezos has created a huge juggernaut which now threatens to eventually outdo Walmart amongst others.  It is fascinating to read how Bezos drove the team to conquer market after market, and used some pretty aggressive tactics to improve (for Amazon) the terms of acquisition when absorbing competitors in various markets e.g. Diapers.com - putting out an aggressive Moms special whilst sitting in the meeting room in the negotiation process with the Diapers management team.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|I gave that a 4-star rating because it is a very funny movie although unrealistic of the worst case scenerio of buying a home that's a fixer upper.  Of course, Tom Hanks and Shelley Long were excellent in this movie as well.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Tried to download minecraft again and it didnt download, but I was charged! This is the second time this happened.
B000002LND|5.0|I gave Immaculate Collection a 5-star rating because it is a masterpiece.  All of these songs were released and were big hits throughout Madonna's extensive musical career.  Of course, I like the 80's songs the best, but the whole album is excellent.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. A lot of science books leave me with a feeling of despair. This one is hopeful and leaves you with a super positive feeling.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|The story's beginning to ramble, but I keep reading because I've become invested in the main characters.  Too many unanswered questions...  Nice plot twist at the end though, which made up for some of the rambling.
1451695195|5.0|Simply mind blowing how could we l rationally doubt after reading this?<br />It will hopefully change the world for the better
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|I felt like this was a video clip of my life...as someone who is turing 40 next year, I could identify with nearly every plot element and the theme of the movie in its entirety.  If you are between the ages of 30 and 50, you will identify with many elements in this movie.  If you are younger or older, you might still enjoy some of the lighthearted comedy, but most others I have talked about this movie with that fit outside that window, simply didn't get it.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to come out anxiously and so as soon as it was available on Amazon instant video, I took the evening to watch it.<br /><br />With non-stop action from the very first of the movie, I felt like I was watching a Die Hard movie filmed in the White House. But that's okay because I loved the Die Hard movies.<br /><br />Channing Tatum as Secret Service hopeful and Jamie Foxx as POTUS both did a super job in \\"White House Down\\", along with Joey King as Tatum's daughter, and the rest of a big star cast.<br /><br />Guns, explosions, crashes , more guns, more explosions and more crashes all went towards over two hours of shoot-em-up FUN!<br /><br />I saw [[ASIN:B00ECU4EPQ Olympus Has Fallen [HD]]] also - a recent movie with a similar plotline - but liked this one much more.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|One of the handful must-read fiction canon.  A poignant, well-written story from the perspective of a storyteller; well-paced and epic, but a true hero's quest without the proliferation of characters found elsewhere.
B00E8G5H6Y|4.0|I had pre-ordered my Blu-ray copy and once I heard there were issues I thought, &#34;Oh great, how long will it take to get a good copy,&#34;I got my copy and have watched it through with none of the issues listed. My only complaint is, the season felt more like some kind of spin off series with very little of the main characters throughout. The last four eps were fantastic and overall production quality is superb.
B00B52F278|1.0|Too much gore, too much screaming and too little plot!  Oh yeah! And lots of gratuitous nudity as well!  Can you say &#34;Made for pay TV&#34;?  What a waste of time!  I really tried to like it!  It looked like everyone was working very hard and trying their best to make a serious film, but it just didn't work for me!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Reading this book was a journey. It too me through so many emotions.. love, scared, anger. It reminded me that it's okay to be human and that you do not need to create a fairy tale version of this life for yourself.. but a real one full of truth. 5 stars. great read. one of my favorites by far. thank you John Green.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|The CD is amazing and when you think the Farewell Tour CD was great, this is another side to share.  Some of the tracks are very upbeat and others very tender and beautiful.  I love each and every track and am looking forward to seeing her in concert in Phila. in April 2014.  With Cher, you can't go wrong.
B0006GANN2|3.0|This is just an OK movie. It just lacked a little something extra that would of made it a good movie. Bobby J.
B00CX7OW1G|5.0|Even if you turn down the sound, a Terrence Malick film is poetry for the eyes!  Someday you will be grateful that you &#34;built a Malick collection&#34;.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|This is a rather fun way of telling a tale of the old west. I enjoyed it and would recommend it as a family movie. thanks, Bobby J.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Enjoy the challenges..realistic..had a liitle trouble figuring out the game at first  but it's still a lot of fun. Would recommend to anyone into hunting for fun.
B0053FANQS|5.0|Movie was received quickly and was packaged well. This a good fast action movie that I would recommend to car buffs and to folks that like action.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I would recommend this to all Preston/Child fans, although it's not as good as their earlier works. Good fast read.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|The movie was received quickly and was packaged well. This is a movie not for all ages. some for the movie was just above kid level. I would recommend it for all others. Thanks.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Fantastic product!<br />I love these head phones. They are great and sound is rich and full. I use them to listen to music, play video games, and of course mix sound. Only draw back is that they are lacking when it comes to base. But it makes up for it in overall sound quality. The ear phones are easy to adjust and the cable is long but the coil design keeps the cable form getting tangled and gives plenty of room to move around.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Unable to get it working on my samsung s4.<br />I really do not want any clouds for any thing i.e. data, txt, numbers, music,dvd etc.
B000J3EEBY|3.0|I love Loreena McKennitt, but this was good, not great.  It just did not pick up enough for me.  The one song, yes is great but the rest drags along.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|I heard one song by Arctic Monkeys and decided to give them a whirl. This is the album I started with and i am not disappointed. The have a good sound. The tracks vary. There's a wide range with some funky bits and some pop bits and some blues-like bits. Great album, great place to start with this band.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great for wearing your brain out in the evening. It's a mindless activity which requires strategy and thinking. You're guaranteed to became addicted.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|This is certainly a different take on the story of Hansel and Gretel.  Not for young children at all.  But for teens and adults who like a lot of action and some gore it is very entertaining.  I was surprised that it was as good as it is.  Jeremy Renner does a good job as Hansel.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally addicted to this game, I love it.  I have been playing for a white and yet I still enjoy playing it. Highly Recommended.
B000P0J09W|4.0|This is a fun movie for the entire family.  You don't have to worry about language, nudity or any of the stuff that is so common in movies today.  It will definitely entertain the kids.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very addicting and fun app. You can get friends and family to play with and send gifts back and forth. I enjoy playing daily.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Perfect challenge at the end of the day. The graphics are adorable and I like the writer's sense of humor.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. I downloaded it for my 5 year old and I like playing it just as much as he does
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Made me laugh, and loved all the one liners.  It also teaches a lesson, about not being selfish, and thinking of others needs before ourselves.
0393057658|5.0|A great read !<br /> Learned a lot about a sport I love, as well a a new perspective on how to evaluate a player.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was a great book a lot of action but chapters kind of switch from this to that other wise it's a five star rating!
B00428CPUY|5.0|Great video, love the Crossroad series. ZZ Top is an added great to this video.  Not sure of Vince Gill though
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Love it.  It is perfect for working and very relaxing to use.  I haven't been&nbsp;bothered by the fact that sounds loop.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Once in a while you come across a book, a story about which you can say, &#34;I feel like a better person for having read this.&#34;  A Higher Call is just that book.  It reminds us that there is a great deal of humanity and honor beneath the uniforms of service men and women.  I love historical books and the story of these amazing yet ordinary men read like a fluid novel I couldn't put down. Thank you for bringing us their story.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Okay, here's the thing:  I was feeling totally psyched that the third book in the DIVERGENT trilogy came out, but to be honest, Roth needs to rewright this book so the ending doesn't SUCK So badly.  I expect this great, big, &#34;Happily ever after&#34; type of deal, but when I actually read the book, all I feel is pity for Tobias.  This is why I love The Hunger Games so much, because you know, at the end of the series, that Katniss and Peeta live happily ever after.  After all Tris has been through, losing about all of her friends and family, she just dies?  Not only was this book complicated and dull, it was also full of grief and misery.  I was suprised when Uriah died, yet alone Tris.  And you can never be sure what's going to happen to Tobias.  Will he just live on and find some other girl to replace Tris?  Will he just decide he can't live with it and kill himself?  Ultimately, I'm no critic, but allegiant was a waste of my money (and time).
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Incredible book. Intense action. Truly epic ending.<br /><br />The epics universe is great with a nice new twist done on super heroes. It's great that Sanderson shows how intelligence and ideal can beat back brute force.<br /><br />Well done.
030789701X|5.0|I love all the information contained in this book. When I get stuck in the game or have questions, this book is such a great reference. And there is SO much information.  Wonderful!
B0052U59F4|3.0|With all the hype I was expecting more.<br />Well written and easy reading.<br />Was good enough that I'll try the next book.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Home For Christmas is a most beautiful Christmas CD!!  Susan's voice is exceptionally beautiful in every one of these Christmas songs and who better than Susan to bring them the warmth and feeling they deserve.  My favorites are the duet with Elvis (\\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\"), \\"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\\" \\"I Believe In Father Christmas,\\" the duet with Johnny Mathis (\\"When A Child Is Born\\") and the brand new \\"Miracle Hymn\\".  I highly recommend this CD for anyone looking for the perfect holiday music.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|The best movie - good enough to see twice or more.  Anthony Hopkins is outstanding! Alec Baldwin is his usual pompous self.  You have action, adventure & drama.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|While I respect Ms. Roth and her wonderful storytelling ability, Allegiant was my least favorite of the three books in this series. And while I understand the authors decision and reasoning for the ending of this story... I can't ignore the fact that I was, as a reader, so extremely disappointed. Allegiant didn't take the easy road and not everyone has a happy ending, I understand that, and it even made sense considering the circumstances everyone was under.... BUT... Either way, I still don't have to like it. So, for the slow pace of the story and being invested in a story for three years, just to have an unfavorable ending... I'm going to have to give this one 3 stars.
075669812X|5.0|This book kept my grandson's interest for hours, and he still refers to it when building with his legos.  It was worth the money.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|This was a gift my 36 year old son wanted  for his Birthday. It came on time and packaging wasn't damaged!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This movie is a great family movie. Every one of every age should enjoy it, plus it makes a great gift item.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I enjoyed this book. It kept my interest. It isn't a OMG I can't put it down, but it is worth the read.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I’d have to say I wasn’t a big fan of cancer before I started this novel (I lost my grandfather to pancreatic cancer), and I’m even less of a fan of this debilitating disease after finishing this depressing read. But I have to give John Green his due. He could have taken the concept for THE FAULT IN OUR STARS and spun it in an entirely different direction, leaving me in a constant state of despair and depression and during which time I would have needed to be slightly medicated in order to push through the pain. Instead, though, there’s a lingering sense of sadness, but it’s coupled with a sense of hope and a slightly eccentric voice that at times might sound like it has been recycled through a respirator.<br /><br />Hazel Grace Lancaster was fun and exciting and more than a bit eccentric and even now, it’s hard not to picture her wheeling around an oxygen tank. But she doesn’t want your sympathy. Instead, the tank manages to put another quirk in her step and offer up a bit of wind drag. Her idiosyncratic voice and her rather humorous take on a dire situation had me cheering for her every step of the way.<br /><br />Even her best friends Augustus and Isaac offered up flashlights in the impending darkness. Despite life dealing all three of them a bum hand, and then piling on the cockroaches inside the mayonnaise sandwiches, the three handed their time-stamped lives with a wisdom and strength well beyond their years.<br /><br />Relationships ended and others began, as the wheels of time continued to spin; books needed to be read and video games attracted attention; new classes were discovered; and families coped with the impending loss that might hover around the next corner, or then again, it might not. And I couldn’t help my sense of enjoyment, even as I knew it might come with an expiration date.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B00EUGYM04|4.0|They had some of the old songs, but the new ones are Seether getting better each album. I love this band, & it also arrived on time. As with all your items. It's a great CD !
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This was magical and unbelievable. I want to tell you everything but that would be spoiler and I just can't do it. So read it yourself and enjoy it.
B00DW1WR14|2.0|It was such a love, hate, kind of music. It was not the old Pearl Jam, they sounded tired, & uninterested. There was only one or two songs I liked. The rest, a bit lame.
B000067QMD|5.0|Super affordable option to use with advent bottles for sealing breast milk for storage and freezing. great option when freezing. Easily interchangeable with nipples, seals tight and quickly thawed in fridge and ready to warm. i love that i didnt have to purchase several storage containers for pumping when my son was in nicu. no extra bulk in my cabinets!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun and I enjoy playing as the zombies. If you like killing stuff then recommend this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing!!!!  I love it!! You can even visit your friends on here!!! You should get it!!!! :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A truly great book! If you haven't done so for a while, I recommend reading The Shining before tackling this. Don't think that by by watching the movie that this book will make sense. Wonderful sequel to one of my favorites! Thank you Mr. King for another amazing story!
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|This cd is AMAZING!!! I have always loved Tom's voice since I got &#34; Night Songs&#34; on cassette for Christmas in 1986!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book! It had me staying up late just to finish it.  The story is smart and engaging and just when you think you have it figured out, you are in for a surprise.  I have not read any other books by this author but plan to check them out also.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool. I play it everyday. I don't get why I'm the only guy who gave this game a five star
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Listening to this album made me realize just how talented Eminem is a rapper. He articulate words and bring them together in meaningful ways. This album is a instant classic and everyone should listen to it so they can know what real rap is. I love every track because it's diverse with creativity. King EM is a rap god and if anybody don't have this genius in their top 5, they don't know rap.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great on kindle fire. fills gaps left by amazon when making the device. the temperature gage is my favorite because it's unique to this app and interesting. tells you EXACTLY how much time you have left before your device dies, which is great when you're on the go. it even tells you your top battery-hogging apps.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is challenging but fun. The more you learn how to play the more strategy helps you progress versus dumb luck. Each level offers new an different challenges. Some levels frustrating  but when you get past them it's worth it.
0316219266|5.0|Jeff B is a true visionary, no doubt. People always fawn over Steve Jobs but Jobs had a laser like focus into a pretty narrow field of technology - consumer electronics. Jeff spreads his ideas all over the map and is not afraid to fail. From books to logistics to cloud computing, tablets, etc. Amazon is revolutionizing everything it touches. A really well written, well researched book.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Boy goes on quest. Boy meets girl (he hopes). Boy has hero's journey. Boy comes up against bad, bad guys. Will boy win? Will boy get girl? Can you possibly be surprised?<br/>Set amidst a geek-cool backdrop of video games, this is The Matrix meets The Last Starfighter meets D&D. And I loved every minute of it. <br/><br/>Takeaway: I'd rather read about people playing video games than play video games.
B004J4XGN6|4.0|Eric Ries does a good job at laying out some of the fundamental principles being followed in the internet space. if you are interested in or plan to start your own internet company this is a good place to start.
B00BLGDFH2|2.0|The documentary feels like 1/2 a doc and 1/2 an ad for this album. And it's not all that great. Get the Paul McCartney track and the Rick Springfield and scan the rest.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Excellent game, I wish it was a bit longer though and more challenging. Although not much replayability. Definitely worth the price
B0079XPUOW|4.0|A cute piece of piffle. The prologue works as a nod to Hitchhiker's Guide humor but also pays off in retrospect. The plot is episodic, but then, it's supposed to be. Riffing on a whole series of Star Trek tropes (Alternate Universes, time travel, etc) there's a satisfactory meta quality. Elevating Background Performers to the roles of protagonists is hilarious. And the Codas, while they divert from the tone, work precisely BECAUSE they divert from the tone. <br/>It all feels like a writer's exercise. But one that works.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a vividly created world.  Deliciously dark.  The mystery is addictive.  Immediately bought the next installment, SHIFT, and both Omnibus Audiobooks from Audible.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk is an enigma inside a mystery, locked up in a computer and escapes through your speakers with something futuristic, yet Funky and Soulful! I bought this album because I LOVE the single &#34;Get Lucky&#34; but found that this album is a journey through music and time and space. I think it's one of their best albums to date. Giorgio by Moroder, actually has the king of Disco and Dance Music lyrics and production, speaking throughout the song and it's brilliant and haunting. There's some wonderful ballads that sound strange and other worldly with synth vocals. This is pure creativity at it's finest, and an album I will treasure for years to come
B00F4386PY|5.0|Love this album. Purchased it when it first came out in 2009. Has cool rockers like Got Some, The Fixer, Gonna See My Friends, Johnny Guitar, and Supersonic. A great love song in Just Breathe. A tearjerker in The End. Both songs used in episodes of Castle. Speed of Sound is a nice song. Some prefer the demo version. But both are great. My top 3 on the album though are Unthought Known, Force of Nature, and Amongst the Waves.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Cher is back with another amazing album packed full of awesome dance tracks and a few ballads as well. It stands right up there with Believe and Living Proof in it's style and mastery. It's infectious grooves will have you want to dance and wave your hands in the air. Closer To The Truth went beyond my expectations and showed me that Cher never lost it, she just put it on hold for awhile. Her voice sounds great and her lyrics are empowering and uplifting and some are heartbreaking. Cher brings out the DIVA on this album big time and you will feel like this is a Woman's World!!! I LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!!!
B00479SVBU|5.0|Perfect for older vehicles that do not have MP3 player input jacks. Just tune to a &#34;dead&#34; FM frequency on your car radio and set this to the same frequency. Works great. The 'shuffle' ability is not perfect but good enough.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I play it non stop. There are lots of says to speed the game up by purchasing farm aids, but very easy to play without spending money as long as you have a little patience. PLEASE add me my ID# is FAQIIOZ. I play a lot, and will send gifts!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Nice but optional characters for the tiles would be nice. these are hard to recognize. which makes them hard to match
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|Classic JT!!  Great from beginning to end...  Between this and part one I think he pulls off one of the best double albums in a long time!
0142403873|5.0|Julia Donaldson is a master story teller and the illustrations are perfected suited to the story. We love the rhyming and the cleverness of the mouse. This book was an instant favorite for my now 3-year old.  My husband enjoys making up voices for the different characters. We also purchased &#34;Room on the Broom&#34; which is another favorite by this author/illustrator pair.
B001CC7PKS|5.0|This is what I honestly hoped the theatrical release would and could have been...  Anyone that knows Daredevil the character knew that a PG-13 version of this character would never do it justice...  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and you won't be sorry!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|What's not to like...new stryper! It's got great hooks, great guitar...great everything!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders gamme was a awesome one of the best books i have ever read in a long time. Or it is a must read book.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|As a basic alarm clock it's good. Tried the music and sounds setting for the wake up alarm or sleep mode but there was nothing to choose from other than white noise. Also has different clock faces and would be nice if the antique clock actually ticked. The basic weather is nice but if you want more info then that's an app you must purchase, disappointing.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Worst Book ever ... seriously don't waste your money. Took forever to get to an exciting part of the book. I mean it just dragged on and on  and then the ending just ... well no spoilers but let's say I wanted to throw the book out the window. I don't see where all the hype came from.<br />Just wait for the movie, I'm normally prefer the book versions but I think in this case, I'll prefer the movie.<br />Seriously ... just borrow the book, don't spend money on it.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|I loved everything about this book. I especially loved The Bell Jar's symmetry... the electrocution of the Rosenbergs, and Esther Greenwood's electroshock therapy; the bird coming out of the egg in the fig tree and Esther's witnessing &#34;a baby coming out of a woman;&#34;<br /><br />A little historical context: The Bell Jar opens with a reference to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg- a real-life couple electrocuted in 1953. They were convicted of conspiring to commit espionage when they were accused of stealing America’s most precious military secret at that time- the atomic bomb- and giving it to the Soviet Union. The Rosenburgs maintained their innocence until their deaths, and were regarded as innocent and became widely celebrated martyrs. Evidence was collected that clearly indicated that Julian Rosenburg had indeed sold government secrets to the Soviets, but no such evidence was provided against his wife, Ethel. Ethel Rosenberg was dragged into the case solely to put pressure on her husband to talk, and in 2001, David Greenglass admitted to lying on the witness stand regarding her involvement. Ethyl was the first woman in this country to be given the death sentence, and Americans were horrified. Even more horrifying was that the first attempt at electrocution failed, and two minutes after it was administered, Ethyl Rosenburg was pronounced alive. A second round of electrocution was meted out and jolts were inflicted, cooking her brain, until a plume of smoke rose from her head and curled up to the ceiling fan.<br /><br />The semi-fictional main character, Esther Greenwood, responds to this nation-wide horror and speaks to premonitions of her own future electro-shock treatments at the books opening by saying,<br /><br />&#34;The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick, and that's all there was to read about in the papers -- goggle-eyed headlines staring up at me on every street corner and at the fusty, peanut-smelling mouth of every subway. It had nothing to do with me, but I couldn't help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive all along your nerves.&#34;<br /><br />An interesting note is that in The Bell Jar, Esther Greenwood’s first electroshock treatment was also a botched attempt.<br /><br />Sparked by a growing dissent within herself and a violent sexual encounter, awareness blooms that her fledgling hopes for her inert potential have been preempted; waylaid by gender-based societal expectations that fuel a growing contempt for patriarchal roles and the women who subjugate to them. As Esther wrestles with budding resentment, she engages in a dangerous, self-destructive dance, moving her closer to her impending suicide attempt.th me, but I couldn't help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive all along your nerves.&#34;<br /><br />An interesting note is that in The Bell Jar, Esther Greenwood’s first electroshock treatment was also a botched attempt.<br /><br />Sparked by a growing dissent within herself and a violent sexual encounter, awareness blooms that her fledgling hopes for her inert potential have been preempted; waylaid by gender-based societal expectations that fuel a growing contempt for patriarchal roles and the women who subjugate to them.

B005FITIIC|3.0|I imagined this movie to be about the 2008 market crash and who was really responsible for it.  It started out making you think they were going to explain all the conspiracy theories you hear about, but they stopped real short of going there.  I was a bit disappointed about that.  I was hoping it would expose the truth about banks and the top bankers who caused the crash due to their greed and allude to the fact that they should pay for their crimes.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|GREAT MOVIE....EXCELLENT SHIPPING AND HANDLING!!! PRETTY MUCH SATISFIED WITH EVERYTHING...EXCEPT MY BLU RAY FROM AMAZON DID NOT COME WITH THE SLEEVE THAT WERE SHOWN ON THE PICTURES!!! BUT OVERALL PRETTY SATISFIED!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I only saw the movie, but now wish I'd read the Shining. Doctor Sleep is so entertaining that I'm sure will be a movie one day. As with all movies, the book was better.<br />I loved this book

B0055PGUYU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It opened my eyes to a new way of thinking and covered a topic I knew close to nothing about. The author does a phenomenal job at explaining his findings and ideas. I'm recommending this book to everyone I know!

B00FKAA3MA|4.0|The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was actually a surprising album. The title of the album was a mistake as Eminem was trying to prove that he could go back to his original formula that made him famous in the first place, but he couldn't get there for the whole album, though it was a good attempt at it. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 is Eminem's best Post-Retirement album to date, but he still can't quite match what he did back in his early days.<br />Let's get this off the table right now, Relapse was awful, and Recovery was good at best. But The original Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show stood far above everything else he's put out. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was his attempt at getting back to those days where he really made a name for himself. He was surprisingly successful at it at most points in the album. But the mainstream has gotten to Eminem at a few points which really wears the album down.<br />Mathers started out with the single \\"Berzerk\\" which is a fitting name for the song because it can't quite seem to stay put in one place. It's the craziest and most ADD song he's ever released, and it works to an extent but it'll wear you out by the time you're done listening to it a few times. \\"Survival\\" was somewhat of a sellout point for Eminem as he's negotiated with the Call of Duty franchise and released this song because of it. As a single, it works, but it's one of the least enjoyable tracks on the album.<br />\\"Rap God\\" was disappointing to say the least. With a beat that should never have ended up in Eminem's hands, he spits rhymes for an exhausting six minutes. He tries to mix it up later in the song as he does his infamous 96 words in 15 seconds piece, but after hearing songs like \\"Look At Me Now\\" by Chris Brown and \\"Worldwide Choppers\\" by Tech N9ne, it seems like Em has shown up late to the party. I liked the song \\"The Monster\\" but that doesn't mean it was good. It's pure Radio bait, and actually does more harm than good to who Eminem is as an artist. It's a popon the verge of dance track with Rhianna only putting icing on the cake as it being some fluffy radio filler track.<br />As for the rest of the album, it rises to the title of the album and rewards long time listeners of Eminem with a couple of tracks that will bring back memories of listening to his earlier stuff. Songs like \\"So Much Better\\", \\"Legacy\\", \\"Rhyme or Reason\\", and \\"Brainless\\" will conjure up the feeling of nostalgia for a lot of long time Eminem fans, which is long overdue with this being his third post-retirement album.<br />Despite the singles being disappointing to say the least, The Marshall Mathers LP 2 will satisfy long time fans of the whitest rapper in the game.<br /><br />FINAL SCORE: 7.5/10<br /><br />Must Have Songs:<br />Rhyme Or Reason<br />So Much Better<br />Legacy<br />Brainless<br />Stronger Than I Was
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Too sad, I really love this book but it's too sad. I am literally crying right now and probably for days. Why?!

B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Her comics are soo refreshing!  She's not piggy backing off anyone else's work, I don't even think she's aware of anyone else's work.<br /><br />This book is just comics based of her child hood experiences, they are totally unique and original; she's from her own planet.  I'm gonna call her weird and that is definitely praise, she is absolutely hilarious and wonderful!  What a quirky girl.
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|I am not a reader.  So invested in technical manuals that I read too slowly to take time for casual reading.  Could not put this book down. It's so plausible that it is terrifying.

B00FJMK9VE|5.0|Huge buildup for this album. I pre-ordered it, and got the download a little before midnight last night. I listened to it all night long, and I just love it! From the incredible album cover to the fantastic 12 songs, it just blows me away. I am extremely impressed with these guys to put an album out like this. The guitar work is fantastic, drums great, and bass guitar great. I can't say enough about this album. All my friends will be getting the CD version of this album for Christmas this year! Do yourself a favor, and buy this album. They have obviously worked hard on putting this together, and it shows. Thank-you Stryper for putting out this incredible CD.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|LOVE THIS NEW VERSION graphics are superb. Multiple hunting trips for different style guns. Hunt deer, wolves, ducks etc.  Earn money on hunts for upgrades to current weapon or buy a new one.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't want to jump on this band wagon but now that I have I will do anything to stay on.
B002RI9TB4|4.0|I would say that this book is a vivid and deailed account of the war in Nigeria, which gave origin to the Republic of Biafra. But it is much more than that. It can be said that the book \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" is about love and hatred, loyalty and betrayal, fear and bravery, and ultimately endurance - It is a portrayal of the Human race. Someone once said that \\"by nature no one is called upon to bear more that one can endure\\" and Olanna, one of the main characters, is proof of that, did she endure!!!. I compare this book to Aminatta Forna's \\"The Devil who danced in the water: a daughter's memoir\\". with one slight difference: the characters in Aminatta's book are real but Chimamanda succeeds in making her characters seem just as real.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was amazing just makes me mad how different the movie is. It could have been so much more better if they followed the book more

B00GBCMW9S|5.0|One of the best albums of all time. Eminem always manages to amaze. I feel sorry for the people who are too simple-minded to appreciate this.
006202406X|1.0|I loved Divergent and Insurgent tremendously, and anxiously awaited the arrival of this book. Unfortunately it left me disappointed on all sides. The fact that the factions were an experiment made it just like most other dystopian novels - where I hoped this one was different. The ending was sad and depressing, and leaves a bad taste in my mouth for the whole series now. I don't care to really see the movies now.<br /><br />You want the ending of a book to be better than you expect, that's what makes the reader a believer in the author and the story and the characters. But this one was a let-down, and just unfuriating. If I wasn't so invested, I would have just quit reading halfway through when I could see where it was going. Save yourself the trouble from buying this book, and read a synopsis online.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|I'm new to the Amazon movie watching experience and really like it on my IPad. Only with they had more good choices. That said... Warrior is a great movie... great tough guy movie but there is a love story and all seems very realistic.
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|I like most of the songs on this 2-CD set. B. Guy is in fine, fine form throughout -- voice and guitar. The tracks that I have to skip over are 4 of the 5 w/ guest singers on them. The only collaboration w/ a singer I can listen to throughout is the one w/ Gary Clark, Jr.  Guy's producer did Guy a disservice by having so many guest singers on here, most of whom are not blues vocalists. I would rate this 5 stars if Guy sang all the songs throughout. B. Guy does not need guest singers to sell a new CD.<br />But there is plenty of good music here, at a reasonable price.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was so nice to hear that danny Torrance was back! The shining is one of my favorite books, I've re-read it several times and will probably read it again after reading doctor sleep. I have read all of Stephan king,s books and refuse to part with any of them until you try to pry them out of my cold, dead hands!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Love this game, it is very addictive, very easy to follow instructions and easy to understand the different missions and levels. Will try other games related to this game.
B0047C2IIE|2.0|Paying 9.49 for this was a rip off. The music itself is great, but the sound quality is terrible. Sounds like someone TAPED it from a scratchy old record. This is one of the greatest Christmas albums ever and it deserves to be remastered.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is fricking hilarious.  Her stories range from the ridiculous to the truly poignant, and the conversational manner in which the book is written makes it feel like she's talking to you.

B008220C56|1.0|Having watched several cinematic versions of Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece, I was really looking forward to watching this movie and purchased the Blu-ray version. Once I began watching it, however, I was confused and disappointed with what I saw. I had a difficult time following the characters. At first I thought that Kelly MacDonald was Anna. To me, the story line departs so far from the book as to make it unrecognizable.

B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Neil Gaiman is just not for me folks!<br /><br />I was recommended this book by Amazon and GoodReads and let me tell ya, this was a bitter disappointment.<br /><br />It's a really short book, more like an exaggerated short story with nice binding, so it only took one sitting to get through.<br /><br />I just cannot for the life of me ever relate to what is going on in his books or to his characters. There's always so many questions unanswered and left to your own imagination. The problem with that in his style of writing, IMO, is that it's his fricking imagination that I'm paying for, that I'm looking for! That's why I picked up YOUR book. If I wanted to dream up a world, I would do it. But I would know why things the way they are and be able to not leave big gaping holes of nothing along the plot lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: I just always feel cheated whenever I read a Neil Gaiman book; I never get the full story. I'm always left wondering and never wanting more.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|great product does exactly what it is supposed to do. no much more to say about a wire. but it is multi functional. no only for kindle.
B009R659L8|2.0|So this is the first book by Mary Higgins Clark that I have ever read. From her biography on here, I can see that I've been missing out on this great mystery thriller author.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book took me 6 days to read it. That's an awful long time for me, especially when it comes to a mystery thriller.<br /><br />It turned out to just be alright. I think the reason why I wasn't so gun-ho about it was because I was in the middle of already reading a series that was horrible BTW and just wanted to finish it.<br /><br />After picking this book up and putting it back down, I was having difficulty remembering all the characters in this story. I'm glad that Clark kept repeating who they were and what their position was in the story, otherwise I would have just given up.<br /><br />The ending was a nice wrap up and there was a twist that I was not expecting, but overall this book was just ok.<br /><br />Bottom line: Ok mystery thriller. However, I will be interested in reading more of Mary Higgins Clark.
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. as long as I am entertained I am happy with purchased.I find that thi kind of rating is very individual. I was not bored. good job on the part of the actors.
B0027MJU00|2.0|Ok so I've been on this kick for reading everything Gillian Flynn.<br /><br />I read Gone Girl first, then Sharp Objects, and now Dark Places.<br />I realize that authors progress and grow with their books, and you can tell that this one was an earlier, first timer kind of book.<br /><br />I really, really liked Libby in the beginning of the book. It's hard to hold someone's attention when the main character is this lazy, cynical, female dog who hates everything and everyone. She actually made me laugh in the beginning.<br /><br />But then...the story just took a wrong turn for me. Yes, the investigation to find out who did it, who was innocent, who was guilty, even in the smallest measures of those words, all that was interesting and had me turning the pages to find out more. HOWEVER....<br />*********************SPOILERS*******************learning about driving to and from places, whether it was Libby, or Patty, her mom, and describing the scenery in those &#34;on the edge of your seat cliffhangers at the end of a chapter&#34; and then working the reader into thinking that you're actually going to find something out, and then start talking about driving and cows and gravel for two pages, you kind of just like...go WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS STUFF RIGHT NOW? DON'T YOU REALIZE WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF FINDING OUT THE TRUTH!??!. Ugh. And then AND THEN! those poor poor cows. I did NOT need to read about the slaughtering of that bull.<br />Diondra is one crazy person. I felt that Ben was bullied so much and didn't get the love and support he needed from family, so you take pity on him for following along with whatever Diondra wanted, but you spend YEARS, nay, DECADES of your life behind bars and don't you think he would become none the wiser and say you know what? screw this stuff, this female dog is going down. I am going to tell the truth. That part was just so unbelievable to me.<br />I got bored with learning about the useless characters in the Kill Club group. I don't care about them. Yes of course Lyle was important and very helpful with finding out who the killer was and all the details. But just the way that it all ended...yuck. Not the way I pictured Flynn to wrap it up, and never touch base with any of those people even though they were the catalyst to this whole search and rescue kind of discovery. There was no party for Ben or Libby for that matter. And what the yuck happened to Crystal?? *************************END OF SPOILERS*******************<br /><br />There is more to the story that I didn't think held up either, but to be honest, I am so tired right now. This book took me 2 days and one really late night to finish, because life and work got in the way, but I just HAD to know what happened.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is not my favorite Gillian Flynn, but I'm glad I read it or else I would have always wondered. It was just ok for me. Not as twisted or a psychological thriller as her other books. I just know that I have a taste for her writing and I wanted something more, something better, something I knew would shell shock me. This one didn't do any shocking.n't care about them.

B008I34ZFW|4.0|What starts as a routine search mission on the Moon for Helium & other resources brings today's world into contact with Moon Nazis. Then sparks fly & we realize that a Third Reich version 2.0 is well underway and coming to our world soon! This movie plays both funny and serious often intentionally and sometimes I think not. It's a risky venture when you play one off against the other but they did it and it worked well. The three women stars of this movie are really the stars.Julia Dietze is the educator of a future generation of Nazis youth but also the voice of reason as well as that hot babe that Gotz Otto & Christopher Kirby have their eyes on. Stephanie Paul is the Sarah Palin knock-off who in this world is already the president and her character brings some well needed laughs to the story. Peta Sergeant plays the campaign advisor to the prez but quickly climbs the ladder to commander of essentially everything that can be launched at the invading outer space army. There is a lot of character development wiggle room that goes on with these 3 strong women & it makes the movie and it's important the director Timo Vuorensola got that. Rounding out the main cast is Udo Keir who is the aging Fuhrer and leader of the invasion force. This movie really cuts across the grain. By that I mean the uniform worn doesn't tell you the good guys from the baddies here, you will have to do a little homework. Other observations, it's hard to understand why this got an \\"R\\" rating by the MPAA. You take out one or 2 scenes and this could easily pass as a PG movie. It's surprising Peta Sergeant ( especially) or the other ladies didn't ramp up or were scripted more adult scenes & I even wonder if it crossed the Producer or Director's mind to incorporate a sexy option as it would have fit the script well and they already had the \\"R\\" rating. There was a lot a juggling evident as all involved made this project work. From Making Frankfurt look like New York to facing 2 metres of flood waterin their base camp in Australia to filming against green walls and hoping CGI add ons would make this vision come to life.It all worked out in the end even raising funds every which way. If you like Science fiction you have to admire what was accomplished here. I think just the unlikely way this movie was put together the big budget look though this wasn't the case and the constant damage control makes this a Cult Movie. The odds were against this film ever being made and especially being this marketable. 4 stars for me as the ending ( while possibly leading to future spin-offs)was a little weak and as previously stated it should have veered in a more adult direction. The DVD special features are top notch, trailers, behind the scenes stuff ( lots) & the director/producer audio commentary option is superb, you get the whole story there & it is really interesting. I enjoyed this movie and I think you will too!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Sylvia Day is a b!tch.<br /><br />There I said it.<br /><br />Honestly, WTF was she thinking? She told us and led us all to believe that this would be a trilogy. NOPE. Totally screwed us over! And not the way that we like it! UGH!<br /><br />There was just so much CRAP in this one.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead...<br />****************SPOILERS**************<br />So now their married and Cary is going to have a baby. For as long as Eva was complaining about not waiting to get married, and saying it was too fast, she countered herself every second. &#34;I love him so much, I need him, I can't imagine my life with him&#34; and then she would go on dates with other guys or meet up with them like it was no big deal, but as soon as she saw Gideon with another woman her jealously was so abundantly clear to everyone that she should just marry him and be done it. Eva really annoyed me in this one. Victor Reyes, her dad, found out about was Nathan did to her, since it's public record now that he's dead. And supposedly someone from the Russian mob killed him?? Um what? Day never explained the ending to that one. ******************END OF SPOILERS*******************<br />There were so many sex scenes in this one. I was just tired of them. And no, not that way. I was really bored of them, to the point of skimming over them.<br /><br />I feel like this is a total rip off of 50 Shades of Grey trilogy. Day stole all the ideas from that book. She used to be her own person, but now I understand that she's just in it for the money.<br /><br />Bottom line: I don't think I will be reading anymore of Sylvia Day. She cash cowed out. Very disappointed.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is one of the geekiest books I've ever read.<br /><br />But also one of the best.<br /><br />So much into this book...all the 80's references....it felt like being immersed within The Matrix and the movie with Bruce Willis called &#34;Surrogates&#34; but set in the 80s.<br /><br />So many good things about this book, to be honest it has left me speechless.<br /><br />Bottom line: Best geekiest book I've ever read. Highly recommend.
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|After the death of John Bonham (the drummer for Led Zeppelin), the remaining band members decided not to continue as a band and went their seperate ways.  This album  by Robert Plant was the second album he released as a solo artist.  Released in 1982, this is a great album with some standout songs.  On this album are the following:<br /><br />1. Other Arms<br />2. In The Mood<br />3. Messin' With The Mekon<br />4. Wreckless Love<br />5. Thru' With The Two Step<br />6. Horizontal Departure<br />7. Stranger Here...Than Over There<br />8. Big Log<br />9. In The Mood<br />10. Thru' With The Two Step<br />11. Lively Up Yourself<br />12. Turnaround<br /><br />The stand out songs from this album are \\"In The Mood\\" and the hit \\"Big Log\\".  \\"Big Log\\" is in my opinion his best effort as a solo artist.  The song reminds me of an Arabian Desert with a nomad.  Not the song is not a remake of \\"Kashmir\\", but it has to me an Arabic Sound...espeically the guitar...This is a great CD and is one of Robert Plant's best albums.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B006LSZECO|5.0|WOW.<br /><br />Not going to lie, I was really, really bored with this book when I first began it. But people just kept talking about it. They would not shut up about it, so I just kept pushing on. It took all of my concentration to really read it and so much effort it took to just get through it.<br /><br />There was so much ... &#34;fluff&#34; shall we say? Fluff that I felt could've been scrapped.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil this book for anyone, so I will not reveal the plot twist. But my GOD. Wow!!<br /><br />This was definitely a psychological thriller than any mystery thriller. For me, it didn't go as fast in the beginning. Everyone said to keep going, keep reading, just wait, just wait. So I plunged along and man! I knew that if I gave up, I would've missed out on a really good story. I'm glad I stuck it out. It was a good story. But it's not a favorite. Like the shock factor is there all right, but couldn't say that I would necessarily re-read it. Not to say that if I did re-read it I wouldn't pick up on more things, but this just was a one time book for me, because the big reveal, man behind the curtain is known.<br /><br />Overall, slow beginning, almost to the point where I wanted to give up, but the plot twist was very good, and then the ending was just so-so. It still took me for a rollercoaster ride, which everyone was saying that it would do, so it definitely delivered.
006202406X|5.0|I love this series! Allegiant made me love the series even more and I didn't think it was possible! I despise that people are being so cruel for the ending but I understand why they feel upset. I on the other hand, believed that it was a realistic and heroic ending. I am satisfied with the ending and will forever love the series no matter what. Veronica Roth stepped outside the box with this ending and I am happy that it went this way. People need to look more on what the story carried on and realize that living in a world such as Divergent comes with so many consequences that only come to the people we love, but ourselves as well.<br /><br />FOURTRIS FOREVER
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|This was just ok for me.<br /><br />Ok, don't get me wrong, I'm not heartless or anything. Yes, this book did make me cry and the tears flowed at all the right parts of the book that it should have.<br /><br />Cancer SUCKS. It really does.<br /><br />It's just that...I didn't LIKE the characters of this book. I think that I just couldn't relate to them. I wanted to, really I did. Just so much happened to these kids at such a young age, they will miss their whole lives not experiencing things, not living life, but yet...they seem so wise. Clich&eacute; I know.<br /><br />Bottom line: I think there was so much hype around this book because of the subject matter. A kid with cancer meets more kids with cancer and bond because everyone is dying. It's kind of a hard subject matter to go through; the emotional rollercoaster of watching someone you love slowly die and then being that same person who is dying watching your loved ones watch you wither away. It's a hard, touchy subject. Kudos to John Green, but like I said, this book was just ok for me. I just feel like this was done before, in every OTHER book about cancer. It just felt trite to me.
B00FEHXISA|2.0|Slow, lack of action in the beginning it was just okay - not as good as the first two movies.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|So I lied when I did an update status. I said that this was only my second audiobook; it's actually my third. Now that's out of the way...<br /><br />This book was horrible. I wish I could un-listen to it.<br /><br />I don't give a yuck about the Philadelphia Eagles. I seriously hate football. That was the primary focus of this book. Other than Nikki.<br /><br />Seriously dude? Get the yuck over her! You had a mental break down because of this female dog???<br /><br />And what was with him CONSTANTLY referring to a psychiatric facility as the &#34;bad place&#34; when he is a thirty something year old? Like really???<br /><br />Also, all the references to GREAT pieces of American literature are now tainted because this female cleansing bag, Matthew Quick, decided to &#34;drop knowledge&#34; on us that he once read something great, and now he wanted to prove it by quoting them. Lame! How dare you mention The Great Gatsby, The Scarlett Letter, or even speak Holden Caulfield's name in this horrendous book, let alone compare yourself to him!!!!<br /><br />This is the epitome of why I don't listen to audiobooks...they just suck! Granted I shouldn't base all audiobooks off of this because even if I were to read this book it STILL would be bad!<br /><br />Bottom line: So disappointed in this. I wanted to read it before I watched the movie and now, I don't even want to watch the movie. Horrible.
B002M9WW30|5.0|If your a Sylvister Stalone fan which I am, you can't go wrong ordering the Rocky series. Some of these movies you can watch over and over again. Love it...
B003TSEEDY|2.0|There was just so much hype about this &#34;coming of age&#34; tale.<br />It really fell flat for me.<br />Don't get me wrong, I read it all in one sitting, but this book...I don't even know how to explain it.<br />I got to the end and let out this huge sigh.<br />Were we never supposed to find out who these letters were going to? Did I just miss that?<br />I felt like these letters were the inner monologues of all the Law and Order: SVU victims. The highs, the lows. I was getting so much whiplash.<br />So much going on. With all these kids. So much sex in their lives. Every one of them.<br />I could not come to appreciate this book like others before me.<br />I'm glad I read it, so now my opinion is formed and I can say I read it. But this was not a &#34;good&#34; book IMO.<br /><br />Bottom line: So much hype, such a big let down.
B006BFK5DK|2.0|Don't get me wrong I grew up on Earth, Wind & Fire, but I was a little disappointed on the release of this Album. Only 3 good tracks, which I consider to pretty good. I guess they have spoiled me over the years by having great Albums. This one just dose'nt compare.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I am so glad that I picked up this book. (Yes I know it's an ebook, but you know what I mean!)<br /><br />This was a GREAT romance book.<br /><br />It actually made me forget the typical scenario that happens: boy meets girl, becomes captivated by her beauty, things get heated but get left hanging, then they fight, then they make up, and it's a HEA.<br /><br />This book...yes that all happens, but you don't see it coming. And it's because it's from the man's POV.<br /><br />I thought they had great chemistry together, challenged each other, and it was such a fun read. One sitting!<br /><br />Bottom line: Typical romance, with a twist. It's awesome. Can't recommend it enough. Can't wait to see what else Emma Chase has up her sleeve!!
B00914JWSW|3.0|I bought this because I was seeing the tour and she was performing some of these songs.  But it's just average Streisand. If you buy everything she records, then by all means by it.  But it's not a must have album.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is fun to play, I put it in my kindle for my 3 year old to play and I find myself playing it more than she does! (And she plays it a lot) one I completed a goal I want to keep trying to complete the next one and the one after that...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!!  It can be very addictive, so watch out.  Glad to finally see it on Amazon!!  I have been hooked since day one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was happy I could play on my Kindle but for some reason it will not connect to my Facebook.
0340822783|5.0|This book took me on a journey like I have never experienced. It travels through time and for a moment you feel as if you get to see a bigger picture than we can experience in one lifetime. I loved everything from the different writing styles, the way the stories were entangled, to the personal nature of each character's experience. I was, for the first time in a while, truly captivated. The movie could not do this complex story the justice it deserved.
B003XMKMTQ|5.0|Great, as Always. Love anything clapton....crossroads is Always an Amazing mix of beautiful musicians. I'd precozmente this or any &#34;crossroads&#34; cd. Hours of entertainment.
B002TIOYWG|4.0|A must read for any Ruby developer who isn't familiar with the specifics of refactoring. If you've heard of refactoring and think you're doing it when you move code around, you're probably doing some variation of the specific refactorings discussed in this book. You need to read this book to better understand the various kinds of refactoring that you can utilize to clean up your code base so that it's more readable and maintainable.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Like so many others of his, Sycamore Row is a page turner and you will be so glad if you don't read the end first!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life and I am an avid reader.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This game is the best but takes up too much storage on my kindle fire so I had to delete all my other apps other than that it's a fun kick ass game
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|It was a gift and what the person had requested...Never read it my self. but the movies was very good.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Loved it. Looking forward to the sequel coming out this month. Chris Hemsworth does a great job of portraying the God of Thunder.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|It's an exciting movie, and I enjoyed it thoroughly even though I'm not a big Angelina Jolie fan. Love Liev Schreiber.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Wonderful  book. Never enjoyed the prose more.  More surprises than the expected love john Grisham.  Starting another of his next
B003IDMUWC|5.0|I chose the rating because it's the most well written, gripping piece of writing I've ever read. I couldn't put it down and would recommend it to anyone out there who is wanting to read a gripping court room drama. Stunning!!
B006F8HZYK|1.0|Great classic, but the reason I purchased this one over the others was for the illustrations. Unfortunately there are non illustrations in the Kindle version.<br />Shame on you Amazon.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|It's okay. The price is fair. I used it twice, and top handle ripped when I was trying to grab it. Thank God it was on the soft surface; otherwise, the bag may drop to the ground.<br />It's a little bit small to me. I look like a little kid when I put it on my back... but it does fit my GH2 very well, and you can design your space inside. It's cool. I had to return it, and I probably wont get another one because I dont want to look like a little kid.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are great sounding headphones.  They aren't noise cancelling, however the fact that they are over the ear cancels out plenty of noise.
B00DW5IM9Q|2.0|I really think Dylan is tanking on Self-Portrait - this matches what he's essentially said in Chronicle and in interviews. He is deliberately trying to get fans to leave him alone. The demos here don't dismiss this notion for me, unlike some reviewers. The songs are cheesy, the performances seem forced and he seems to just want to get them over with. The fact that he sent some of the recordings to Nashville for Charlie McCoy and Kenny Buttrey to aid rhythm tracks on, other than his usual method of cutting them live in studio (i.e., he couldn't be bothered to go Nashville himself) speak volumes. New Morning is a better album than Self Portrait but the one takes on that album are far superior to the one takes here. Only a Hobo with Happy Traum is interesting but I can see why he left it off the Greatest Hits Volume 2. The deluxe set has the Band with Dylan at the Isle of Wight - it's far better realized material than here - even though it was non-rehearsed and a bit spotty on some songs particularly Like a Rolling Stone. But overall it's great and it's not included here. Historically this is a testament to a tough time in Dylan's life, when he was living as a recluse and desperately trying to free himself from the Prince of Protest label, even going so far as to deliberately record bad takes of bland songs.
073938399X|4.0|It takes a long time to get through an audiobook, what with all those pauses and feelings the voice actors insert. Novels for the ears became just when I needed when I decided it was time to workout a bit more than not at all. After teaching Oryx and Crake last fall, I decided it was good to listen to The Year of the Flood before I forgot everything I knew about the complex characters and world Atwood created. Of course, it was my Facebook feed that led me to realize MaddAddam had just come out in September, and if I waited to listen to it, if I put it in the queue, I would forget all of book two. These are long books, people. And thus began my month-long journey with MaddAddam.    MaddAddam picks up right where The Year of the Flood left off. Atwood is good and ending her books in this series with characters about to enter the frame, but we don't know who or perhaps why. This time, it's the Crakers who are coming to help Ren, Toby, and Jimmy who are trying to rescue Amanda from two Painballers. Atwood takes readers both back into Zeb's and Adam One's past and forward into the war between humans/Crakers/pigoons and Painballers....    Read the rest at Grab the Lapels!    [...]
0743496736|4.0|If you like Jodi Picoult, this book will certainly not disappoint.  It is engaging from start to finish.  A good read all around.
B00957T6X6|5.0|A massive world full of intertwining stories, GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire will keep you turning the pages every step of the way, dying to know what happens next.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The story kept me entertained and, because it was an easy read, I managed to finish it in a matter of days.  The writing, however, is not great and after reading a few of the \\"love\\" scenes, I began skipping those parts.  They became super repetitive and the author tends to use the same words over and over again.  At times, the writing seems forced because the author strains to use big words.  All in all though, I enjoyed the read.  Read it for what it is; It is not a literary masterpiece.
B00BRUQ3PS|2.0|I found Orynx and Crake beautiful, sad, poignant.  Unfortunately the next two books in this trilogy were a huge disappointment.  Perhaps if Atwood had cut 100 pages from each of them they would have been more readable.  The invented slang of the post apocalyptic world was grating.  Much worse was the psycho-babble new age religion that comes complete with hyms.  At first I thought these hymns etc. were used ironically- but as I progressed through the pages it appears Atwood thought that these silly takes on traditional protestant and anti-war tunes were profound.  I read somewhere that she was actually setting these songs to music and planning to release them.  Too often a well respected author gets lazy and self indulgent and dumps a load on her reader and expects her name and reputation to carry it off.  Sorry Margaret, not this time.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I bought the electronic kindle version of this book and was very pleased.  Having the electronic version made it easy to read this book in public (at the gym, etc.) without broadcasting the fact that I was reading it.  Although the story becomes a bit repetitive and the author overuses the same several words, it was entertaining.  Read it for what it is.  Don't expect a literary masterpiece.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! Needs more in the next update,but is still FUN! Not as fun as the computer version,will need more content. RECOMMENDED for everyone especially minecraft fans like me! It's worth the money.
0140441166|3.0|I was pleased with the condition of the book.  The story, however, is just not my cup of tea.  I have read the book and seen the play.  It's just not for me.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Before I heard any of the singles to this album, I was worried.  Eminem has accomplished so much in his career that I was thinking this would be just another album to make money with no substance or lasting value.  It was after that I heard his singles from the album.  Bezerk, Survival, Rap God and The Monster.  Those were the singles that sold me on the album.  Being from Detroit, Eminem is someone we look up to here.  Unlike most rappers, like Drake, Eminem doesn't sing about being rich and being a womanizer...he sings about real life issues that most of us can relate to.  This album has some awesome themes to it like overcoming adversity, rising above the negatives and making life your own.  For all intents and purposes, this is, in my opinion, his best album to date! Highly recommend buying this!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Amazing graphics, wonderfully fun puzzles - my son (7) and I played it together all morning while he was home sick from school.  He kept saying, &#34;Mom, I love this game&#34; and I did too.  Awesome!!  Will definitely get the 2nd one, if there is a 2nd.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|I don't expect much from music these days.  Either it's a great album or horrible album.  Fortunately for me and other Dion fans...this is amazing!  It's got a pop sound to it that makes it different from her older albums but doesn't conform to what traditional modern pop music is.  This album has great lyrics, great beats and beyond all, a stand out quality that will make this one of the better albums you've heard all year.  Celine Dion has done it again!  Please do yourself a favor and pick this up...right now!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved loved this book.  I've told everyone I know to read it and I hope they do.  Moriarty's wonderful writing style is the best part of the book, but I equally enjoyed the story and characters.  Another reviewer said you could relate to every character in the book and it was true for me, too.  I liked it so much I bought another title by this same author.  Hope it's just as great.  Highly recommend!
0470913029|3.0|A bit unrealistic for Americans!  I used a combination of the &#34;Atkins Diet&#34;, &#34;South Beach&#34; and Paleo instead,  and it worked for me!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Glitchy and not that fun for my boys.  Not recommended.  Maybe just need to reload, but based on what we saw before it froze every 2 seconds, it's not even worth the time that would take.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Media was as described.  Bought this for my grandbaby and me to enjoy.  I love this movie and so do my kids and now my grandbaby.  He loves shows with music and activities and really enjoys this movie with all the color and music and actions.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Love the game so far so good the only problem I have encountered is the facebook please fix it !!!!!  Need neighbors my id is FAUIXBA please add me.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I had been looking for all the Rocky movies for quite some time waiting for a good deal and I certainly got one with this package.  The media was as described.  I am enjoying the movies at my own pace.  It seems when they do marathons on tv, I end up being able to watch only a part of one then have to leave for extended times and can't watch the rest of the movie(s).  Now I have the control over all that.
B0044WWLMU|5.0|Really Good CD, Loved having all of her previous hits in one CD. I can't wait for her next one.
1476727651|5.0|Dan Torrance becomes a real person with his own story, tied to the story of his father and the Overlook Hotel. The villains in Doctor Sleep are horrible and horrifying but are also rounded and believable in spite of their otherworldliness. They are almost sympathetic at times, as great villains must be.<br /><br />And the moment I waited 508 pages for finally came, as I trusted it would, because I knew I was in good hands.
B005IFZ36I|5.0|Leather bound book with a ribbon bookmark. A quality keepsake for anyone who enjoys the weird tales from HP Lovecraft, whom Stephen King and other famous SiFi authors' believe is the master of horror fiction. Very nice book. This is the only book I have seen that claims to have all of his short stories.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome more detail than the movie it's awesome my favorite character is Cato but he dies so peeta or katniss
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Patricia Cornwell seems as bored and disgusted with the characters as I am.  I think that she's reached a creative block and doesn't know where to turn.  I have the feeling that she is just going through the motions, satisfying her publishing contract, and then raking in the profits.  Disappointing.
B00A285OOW|3.0|I like her storytelling-I give her that. But I am tired of her pretensions as a historian. She is not. She is a writer of historical fiction. Period. Her worst is the Other Queen, writing a  if she were th  first person to see Mary a  more than a shallow female. The fact her bibliography did not reference Lady Antonia Fraser's classic 1960's book on Mary was key.she hates the Tudors and the reformation, and it has become tedious. And this Elizabeth invites no pity nor passion. Read these for fun, but do not believe she is the only one who ha  it right.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|If you are a die-hard fan of SEETHER, than this album is a perfect fit to your collection. Not only are there SEETHER classics such as FINE AGAIN, THE GIFT, REMEDY, FAKE IT, and COUNTRY SONG, but there are also rare tracks that could mostly be found on Japanese imports or on Marvel movie soundtracks, as well as three new songs. Out of the new tracks, my favorite has to be SAFE TO SAY I'VE HAD ENOUGH, but I do think it's very clever that the band decided to cover a song that's named after them, originally done by VERUCA SALT. My only problem with this album is that OUT OF MY WAY and HANG ON can be found on the DISCLAIMER II album that was released back in 2004, and that album can be found at many stores, so these tracks seem out of place on this collection. They could've put a few more new songs in their placeto make it a whole, but I digress. Overall, this is one of the better Greatest Hits collections I've seen, way better than the greatest hits discs from BUCKCHERRY and coming soon NICKELBACK, both of which lack any new or rare material.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars
B004AM5BTY|1.0|The kindle edition doesn't have a table of contents. Having to flip through thousands of pages in order to find the play I want to read makes this edition useless to me.
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|After leaving us with a good but poorly produced album IN WAVES, TRIVIUM is back with VENGEANCE FALLS, which is probably their best album. My interest for this album was peaked after I heard that David Draiman was going to produce it, and I can certainly hear his mark on this record. TO BELIEVE and AS I AM EXPLODING both have vocal patterns that are very similar to DISTURBED, and I enjoy that a lot about this album. Aside from that, this is the band's most aggressive album to date, featuring fantastic guitarwork and the best vocal work yet from this band. My favorite tracks have to be the aforementioned TO BELIEVE, AT THE END OF THIS WAR, INCINERATION: THE BROKEN WORLD, and STRIFE. Definitely one of the better metal albums of the year.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 stars
0385743564|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read this summer. Characters are devolved well and you end up caring a lot about them. Great book for Sanderson fans, same quality as Mistborn series but not quite as detail oriented as The Way of Kings. It's awesome seeing the other side of superhero/villain story. Can't wait for the rest of Reckoners series!
B000002P6R|5.0|I, for the life of me, don't know why so many knock this album, FACE DANCES!!! I think it either ties or is a close second to the album, WHO'S NEXT, which is really saying something. I do think it was a good idea to plow forward and record again after Keith Moon died. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the new drummer (he seems to be the same quality of drummer that Keith was), but some do disagree about that. I don't usually like all the tracks on their other studio albums but this one is gold from start to finish. This totally blows away the album WHO ARE YOU, and is also better than the following studio album IT'S HARD. My favorite song is \\"Another Tricky Day\\" and a close second to it is \\"You Better You Bet\\". Those should always be on best of collections of The Who, but \\"Another Tricky Day\\" usually isn't.<br /><br />It's crazy and misleading that this great album has only a 3.5 star average rating!!?? Disregard the rating and don't hesitate in buying this gem!!!!!!

0385737955|5.0|\\"The Maze Runner\\" by: James Dashner is an amazing book.  If you are looking forward to reading this book then be prepared for a very sad but happy ending.  This book is very dramatic, adventurous, and mysterious so it's a little bit of everything.  The book is about a teenager named Thomas who awakes in a big metal box and it brought to a big town.  This place is called the Glade.  Thomas cannot remember who he is, who his family was, or even why he is in this strange place.  All the other teenagers there are having the same problem.  All the people there are male teenagers with a big problem.  There is no escape from the Glade.  New people come in the lift (the big metal box) every month on the same day and supplies if sent to them to survive every month on the same day.  Outside of the Glade is a ginormous maze.  That maze switches its walls everyday so the runners who go in the maze and study it have a new map of the maze everyday.  Also the runners have to be careful of being shut and locked in the maze by the big stone doors that close no matter what at sundown.  If they get shut in then they are also shut in with big half animal half robots called Grievers that will stick a needle in you and poison you.  There is a special antidote that is delivered but it still messes people up big time.  Throughout the book Thomas and his friend Chuck and all the other Gladers try and solve the mystery of the Glade and escape.  Thomas comes by little things along the way that help him remember small parts of his forgotten life.  Everything is fine until the day after Thomas arrives that a girl is sent up in the lift.  She delivers a very important message that will help Thomas solve the mystery of the maze.  Will they get out? Will the girl survive? Will anyone survive? To find out read this book as soon as possible and I guarantee you will enjoy every word of it.
0143035711|5.0|Bob Mason is an amazing helicopter pilot. The raw emotion he felt about not only being in Vietnam, but what went through his mind while flying the Huey in Vietnam, will capture the attention of any serious student of both aviation and military history. The book is a classic, and has earned that distinction very well.
0316219266|2.0|I initially liked this book and it does give some interesting information. But having read the review by Mr. Bezo's wife I am disappointed to learn that there was not a \\"connect\\" between author and subject.<br />Amazon is the forerunner, in my opinion, of e-commerce so I was captivated by the book but wonder, in passing, what COULD have been had the book been a joint effort.<br />Perhaps a sequel will throw out the \\"bad\\" and give us the \\"good.\\" I WANT to hear more about Amazon and Mr. Bezos.
B000ID37RM|5.0|It is a great movie to watch for an entire family and have a discussion over racism, segregation and discrimination which still persist in this country.  I like the book better though.
B000S1M9LY|4.0|James O. Incandenza created the film Infinite Jest, a.k.a. “the Entertainment,” so addictive that anyone watching it couldn’t take her eyes off it and eventually dies from lack of food and water. Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents (A.F.R.), or the Wheelchair Assassins, a Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois separatist group seeking to have Canada secede from the Organization of North American Nations (O.N.A.N.), searches for the master copy and intends to distribute copies and use the film as a weapon of mass destruction. David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest is a satire about our contemporary culture. Specifically, addiction. And not only to entertainment, i.e. the film Infinite Jest. The novel depicts the addicts in The Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House trying, or not trying, to recover from cannabis, cocaine, Demerol and other drugs. And in nearby Enfield Tennis Academy, many students are on drugs. Wallace’s writing is humorous, but beneath the events, sadness flows.<br /><br />While thinking about the power of entertainment in our culture, I recall Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death, where he describes how TV, and more generally, visual entertainment, has transformed the way we think and process information. Whereas reading requires us to process the words and sentences and to imagine the scenes, we can “absorb” the information much quicker when we view a picture or watch a video. But just as taking too much easily digestible sugar rather than complex carbohydrates isn’t good for the body, watching too much TV may be harmful to the mind, from not exercising the muscles in the brain. We have the Internet and we don’t lack information, but what’s more important than information is the ability to analyze data, qualitatively and quantitatively, and to imagine new ideas and possibilities.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is an excellent game I have had TONS of fun with it... I also very highly recommend pocketinveditor pro. You can switch game modes and edit your inventory. But the bad things are: (for minecraft)You cannot join faraway servers and realms will not work yet. (I have a mojang account.) It also updates very slowly on my device. (I know it has happened with others.) Worst of all... on my kindle fire hd , minecraft multiplayer will not show up... (Not my fault.) I very highly recommend this app, today is  (for me) Nov.4 2013 I have version 0.7.5.(written by my 10 yr old son)

0938045768|5.0|Convict Conditioning is the best Work-out book Ever!!!<br /><br />When Paul Wade was released from prison, he had spent nearly two decades behind bars. And much of that time he used to master the techniques of body-weight training. His slow, steady, and progressive training strategies saved his life, and he decided to share<br />his experience with others in his book called Convict Conditioning: How to Bust Free of All Weakness Using the Lost Secrets of Supreme Survival Strength.<br /><br />Paul Wade's Convict Conditioning Training Program is based on performing what he calls the Big Six exercises: push-ups, squats, pull-ups, leg raises, bridges, and the hand-stand push-up. He knows first-hand that some people don't have the muscle strength to perform any of these exercises in the beginning. So he lays out a simple-and-easy-to-follow training plan to help you build muscle strength and endurance with modified exercises to help you progress to performing the Big Six to build your body. And as you get stronger, he shows you how to perform more advanced versions of the Big Six like his mentor, the ex-Navy SEAL.<br /><br />He lays out a basic nutrition plan to help you build muscle. He even denounces the need for protein powder and supplements pushed by muscle magazines and product manufacturers. After all, he built his muscle one body-weight exercise at a time and three square meals<br />a day in the prison cafeteria. He also blows off all the high-tech fitness equipment and programs that have flooded the marketplace since his incarceration.<br /><br />Is Paul Wade \\"The Coach\\" Real?<br /><br />The Paul Wade Convict Conditioning Program will help you build incredible strength and power. But there is some speculation about the real identify of Paul Wade. If you search for Paul Wade online, there's a widespread belief that he may not be someone who did hard time. But that's likely just part of Paul's prison-style strategy to keep a low profile and train like he's preparingfor the fight of his life.<br /><br />He's living breathing proof that you can get bigger and stronger by using your own body-weight. And even if he's an urban legend, the Paul Wade Convict Conditioning Program is based on proven principles of fitness and training that produces results if you're willing to pay the price.<br /><br />I'm in my mid 50's, and have read almost every workout book under the sun. In my opinion, this is by far the best work-out conditioning book I have ever read. It's worth every penny. Five Stars *****<br /><br />Spartan

B00CF34B2I|3.0|On steam it's good, but Kindle version needs work. I own steam version. App claims to be multi-device, but Pc is not one of them, so you pay twice for content. False adverting.

B00F8KIJ2I|4.0|Avril Lavigne's self titled album.  Usually when someone puts out a self titled album it is their most personal album ever, a reflection of who they are as an artist.  For Avril it's just because she &#34;couldn't figure out what else to call it&#34;.  That is somehow very very fitting.<br /><br />Truthfully, &#34;Avril Lavigne&#34; as a whole doesn't deserve a four star review.  I gave it a four star review as it contains some of the best songs Avril has put out in a long time (probably since the &#34;Under My Skin&#34; days).  However, this album also contains a depressingly large number of mediocre filler tracks, and also contains the worst song Avril has ever put out (Hello Kitty).<br /><br />Standouts - 17, Give You What You Like, Hello Heartache, Falling Fast, Hush Hush<br /><br />Rock N Roll - 2.5/5 - The albums opening track Rock N Roll is a catchy song, though the lyrics are full of cliches and lack any depth.  The production is depressingly pop for a song that claims to be an anthem to Rock and Roll.  That being said it is saved by an incredibly catchy chorus.<br /><br />Here's To Never Growing Up - 1.5/5 - Here's To Never Growing Up doesn't have that same saving grace.  It is a bland, boring, generic pop track that as a first single had me very worried for this upcoming album.<br /><br />17 - 5/5 - 17 is the first real bright spot on the album.  The quality of the songwriting between &#34;17&#34; and the albums first two songs are night and day.  The production is very polished, but this song is insanely catchy and is a classic Avril Lavigne song.  This song NEEDS to be a single.<br /><br />Bitchin Summer - 1.5/5 - Then we get to &#34;Bitchin Summer&#34;.  Really, Avril?  You're 29.  GROW UP!  You are not in high school anymore!  The lyrics to this song are ridiculous coming from a married 29 year old.  The chorus is slightly catchy, to end on a positive note.<br /><br />Let Me Go - 4/5 - Let Me Go has really grown on me.  I was originally very turned offby the fact that this sounds EXACTLY like a Nickelback track.  I actually don't have anything against Nickelback, but it just didn't sound right hearing Avril Lavigne sing what should be a Nickelback song.  However, as I said, this song has really grown on me.  Finally a song with rock production to it, and this power ballad is beautiful and elegant.<br /><br />Give You What You Like - 5/5 - Wow.  This song blew me away the first time that I heard it.  It is unlike anything Avril has put out before (almost has a folk-pop sound to it), and it is among the best songs she has ever put out.  It is a well written mature pop song about trading physical pleasures to combat loneliness, and it is simply incredible.<br /><br />Bad Girl - 1.5/5 - Avril Lavigne's big collaboration with Marilyn Manson and in the end it isn't that it's bad, it's just that it isn't my cup of tea.  It's a rock song so I wanted to love it, but it's just plain trashy.  I much prefer Skylar Grey's collaboration with Manson, &#34;Can't Haunt Me&#34;.<br /><br />Hello Kitty - 0/5 - What in the world was Avril thinking here?  Really?  What garbage.  Worst song she's ever made, though I'm sure her sizeable Japanese fanbase will love it.<br /><br />You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet - 1.5/5 - This isn't a bad song (despite the harsh rating), but it isn't a good one, either.  It sounds like it would fit in perfectly on &#34;The Best Damn Thing&#34;, but at the end of the day it's just a forgettable, bland, mediocre pop-rock track.<br /><br />Sippin on Sunshine - 3.5/5 - This song is a guilty pleasure on this album for me.  I can't believe how much I actually like this song!  It's catchy, it's generally well written (if not forgettable lyric wise), but it's just so catchy, and so ear pleasing.  After the three songs before it a little cup of sunshine was much needed.<br /><br />Hello Heartache - 5/5 - Again among the best songs Avril has ever put out.  Hello Heartache ushers in a much welcomed darker, more serioustone to close the album out on.  Hello Heartache is well written, incredibly catchy, and unlike anything Avril has made before it.<br /><br />Falling Fast - 5/5 - Again among one of the best songs Avril has put out since the &#34;Under My Skin&#34; days.  Falling Fast is a well written and gentle ballad that Avril wrote independently.  The production is beautiful and elegant, and this song is oh so very pleasing to the ears.<br /><br />Hush Hush - 5/5 - What a great way to end the album.  Again among Avril's best songs, Hush Hush is a beautifully produced power ballad that builds up to an incredible climax.  The production on this song is breathtaking, and it is the best album closer of any Avril Lavigne album.
0316010669|4.0|I am a big fan of Gladwell, who I find to be witty, intellectually curious, and provocative.  His topic here is the power and limitations of our first impressions and instinctive thinking.  The most interesting observation is the need to tune out the noise of too much data and focus on the key factors that are most outcome determinative.  Thus, Gladwell tells the fascinating story of the Cook County Hospital's adoption of a chest pain protocol remarkably more effective for screening false alarms than the doctor's judgment -- which is too much skewed by background factors such as family history and age which are critical indications of long term risk, but not necessarily the best indicators of an immediate problem.<br /><br />Some critics rightly cite \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Outliers\\" as stronger works.  But I found this book to be very amusing and thought-provoking
B003G4W49C|2.0|I read this book because my teen, who is no dummy, was struggling with it and wanted help. The author's writing style was not to my taste, and the story of genius 6 year olds saving the universe?...  The second half of the book was an easier read, but all in all it was offensive (racist, sexist, homophobic) on many levels. I also recommend you don't read the self-aggrandizing forward in the 're-release unless you want throw your Kindle against the wall.

On a few of the math problems, I entered the answer and nothing happened, there was no enter button to accept my response and no &#34;correct&#34; or &#34;incorrect&#34;  that appeared as in others, it was very frustrating. There was another with matching jewels of the same color and you could see several moves that would work but getting them to move is very difficult and even worse, slow. This is timed and it was very frustrating. A few others had very poor instructions,<br />there are others that were fun to do and i will keep the app and use these puzzles only. I thought this app was perfect for me until i opened it but there is enough there to spend some time enjoying.

B00ELD19OI|5.0|I thought previous Haken albums were definitely good but I think they have found their thing with The Mountain. All instrumentation is exceptional and writing is very diverse like all good prog should be. The only weak factor may be the vocals, but only at times. AND, at least they actually sing vs just alternating low and high screams like many prog rock/metal bands of late. I liked the false larynx thing when it was new and different like 10 years ago but now I'm so over it.<br /><br />The Path is a beautiful melody and gets weaved throughout the album in a really cool way. I could probably do without the song Cockroach King but I'm sure many people will really dig it. It just is more annoying than anything to me :-)<br /><br />All in all a great album and worthy of being in the top ten Prog records this year.

006202406X|4.0|The only reason I can't say that I LOVE this final book in the Divergent series is because of the problem in the voices of the two characters. Tobias and Tris were really hard to distinguish chapter to chapter and I found myself constantly getting confused because they were just so similar in thinking and behaving as opposed to how Tris described Tobias when it was just her. Maybe Tobias always had that girly, scared, kind of awkward type of personality that was well hidden underneath his fearless, bulky and handsome guy Tris saw. I felt his voice to be a tad dramatic at times. Many people have been complaining about the ending and I did, because of the spoilers, know how the book ended and of course I thought: &#34;THAT'S TERRIBLE! WHO DOES THAT?&#34; Once I read the book and finished it, (which was tonight, actually), I realized how beautiful the ending was. This was seem odd and hard to believe to some of y'all ERITUDE'S out there, but you can't control everything and no book will always end how you want it to. I understand that there are questions and doubts and there is heartbreak, but this is LIFE. If you did not like the ending, then you did not understand the meaning of the series and the Tris's purpose for her life. If you do not understand why this ended the way it did, then I will tell you now that you might be the kind of person that kind of resembles Jeanine Matthews. Life is about being brave, being selfless, making mistakes and most of all, letting go. What Mrs. Roth did was create a world and characters that are nothing more than the most unique in the fictional world. They struggled, and they were frustrated, but they forgave, and they loved, and they cried. Happy endings won't always exist and everything in this novel, happened as it should. Nothing miraculous happened. Money didn't pop out of the sky and a new United Stated did not form. It maintained its own reality. Roth did not try to make this fake new happy ending that left the reader feeling at ease and pleased. She did something unexpected. She did something that we as readers may not always be used to. She was REAL. She gave the characters meaning and closure. At the end of the book, all you can think is: They will be okay. Because just like in real life, we have to move on. We lose people. Death comes in and takes our souls and sometimes, without an explanation. Things Happen. This is what this book told me when I finished it. Things happen, and it hurts nonetheless that it ended that way. But if it hadn't I don't think I could've learned as much as I did from such an amazing series. God Bless! I'm excited to read more of Roth.at ease and pleased. She did something unexpected. She did something that we as readers may not always be used to. She was REAL.

B00DJWV11I|3.0|If you've ever seen the 2004 film Alfie starring Jude Law, you may find it impossible while reading this novel to rid yourself of the image of Jude Law speaking directly to the camera/reader as he tells the story of his fall from his lofty perch. Drew Evans is the same gorgeous, narcissistic screw-them-and-leave-them character as Alfie. And the author uses the same confidentially speaking directly to the listener shtick. Only here our \\"hero\\" is a banker instead of a chauffeur. And, we don't hear a lot of details about his other women. Although he doesn't give up other women just because he is lusting after our heroine--after all, a man has needs.  But, most importantly, Drew gets his act together in time to avoid losing the good woman he has found.  The novel is something different from the usual romance and Drew can be quite funny. However, he is also SO juvenile and by Chapter 5 I was finding his narcissistic commentary awfully tedious.  Obviously many others do not.

B00CX7OW1G|2.0|Terrence Malick is one of those directors that I don’t always click with.  I know that he has a very large and supporting group of rabid fans and yet I have yet to be truly mesmerized by him since his debut, ‘Badlands’.  What I have always admired about Malick is that he tries to come at very deep rooted and intellectual subjects from a vantage point of almost complete detachment, allowing us to hover over these subjects without beating us over the head with them.  He’s focused on war and faith and death and celebrity and in each of these instances, even when I don’t feel the film worked as a whole, you find this otherworldly atmosphere thanks to Malick’s thickly laced scope of ideas.<br /><br />I’ve said this time and time again, but Malick is a director who tends to get in his own way.<br /><br />‘To the Wonder’ is, in my eyes, the most disjointed, distracted and overall uneven film Malick has directed.  While I’ve grown accustomed to his use of visual imagery and whispered voice over to create his ‘point’, the use of those images and whispers only reduced ‘To the Wonder’ to an elongated commercial for Zoloft.<br /><br />The synopsis here is rather simple.  Neil meets the free spirited Marina in Paris, where he sweeps her off her feet and brings her and her daughter back to his home in Oklahoma.  Their relationship starts to crumble almost immediately and soon Marina and her daughter pack up and leave.  In her absence, Neil starts to court Jane, a former flame, only to have Marina crawl back home and convince him to marry her, leaving Jane out to pasture.  Marriage doesn’t fix the crack in their marriage though, and soon they find themselves at violent odds.  While all of this is happening, the Spanish pastor in their town is, apparently, struggling with his grasp on his own faith.<br /><br />I’m honestly not sure what Father Quintana has to do with this story, at all (completely reminded me of the useless Sean Penn segment in ‘Tree of Life’), but Javier Bardem was easily the best thing about the movie so I hate to say it should have been removed from the film.  In all honesty, this felt like a really bad editing issue.  Terrence Malick is notorious for chopping his films in half.  There was that controversy over ‘The Thin Red Line’ where he actually cut Adrian Brody right out of the film, and he was slated to be THE STAR.  So, it’s no surprise that Rachel McAdams has like three scenes, but it is disheartening that the Father Quintana storyline feels like a poorly developed subplot.  There is absolutely no flow between these two storylines, despite having Marina briefly confide in Father Quintana about her relationship with Neil (and by ‘briefly’ I literally mean for about five seconds).  Instead, these two stories feel ripped from two separate films and so I really feel like there is very important footage that was left on the cutting room floor that could have developed this into a more cohesive story.<br /><br />Or maybe Malick just wrote a story void of those essential bones.<br /><br />I think that is a major issue I take with this.  Even from a purely spiritual or emotional standpoint, ‘To the Wonder’ feels vacant.  In dissecting the relationship between Marina and Neil, the film goes nowhere.  Their issues are never explored, their fights are never revealed and their tumultuous relationship is pretty much a repetition of pictures that reduce Marina to an obnoxious woman who prances around and wants to be tickled and Neil to a grump who pouts at the camera or walks out of the room with his eyes cast down at his feet.  There is no meat here, no actual character development and so we can’t care for them at all.  The spiritual angle of faith feels like an afterthought, since Bardem’s scenes are sparse and feel like such a tack on I almost couldn’t take them as part of the same film.<br /><br />Yes, ‘To the Wonder’ is beautiful, but it has nothing to say.ee of Life’), but Javier Bardem was easily the best thing about the movie so I hate to say it should have been removed from the film.

1607744104|4.0|I learned alot from this second edition. This is by far, the best book out there that I have come across, on the subject of growing carnivorous plants.<br /><br />My only disapointment was that the author spoke to terrarium culture from his own experience - from a grower's perspective - mostly about tanks and grow lights.  Terrarium information was not complete, from my experience, and there was some cultural information that I would have liked to have found as well.  However, this book covers alot of territory and provides phenominal experience and information for  anyone interested in this subject.  Author also writes well - clear and concise thoughts.<br /><br />Extremely helpful and entertaining. A very worthy book.
0316017922|4.0|If you have not read a book by Malcolm Gladwell before you are in for a treat. Never have I seen his mystery novel like approach to tackling a business topic. He takes us on an intellectual journey by questioning why some 5 year old boys have an advantage over others in the field of ice hockey.<br /><br />He carries his story forward by inspecting the success of well known businessmen and athletes and finds a common thread emerge. The reader learns that the success of these individuals was not solely built on their talents, but also aided by their circumstances. However what set these individuals apart was their single minded pursuit of these talents with conviction that took them from yet another datapoint on a predictable curve to an outlier.<br /><br />Learn about why the 10,000 hour rule makes a difference to which of your talents could be your strengths, This book is a fascinating read for employees and entrepreneurs alike.<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell doesn't provide actionable advice on how to implement those strengths. I would recommend that a reader look to Mr. Buckingham's books for that purpose.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Well, here we are at the end.  The first four books in this series were SO DANG GOOD and then the next few were ok, and the last few were just plain terrible. This one was pretty good - certainly much better than the three before it.  I liked how Harris wrapped the story up.  I think you'll enjoy this one, but maybe buy it on Kindle to redeem yourself off all the money you spent on the bad ones!!!
0307951529|4.0|Chris Guillebeau was one of the bloggers who turned me onto the possibility that someday I too might be able to pursue entrepreneurship and writing.<br /><br />Having met Chris in person and attended his WDS this year, I can tell you that he wrote this book with the intent of helping others. That intent is palpable in every chapter. In this book he presents case studies from around the world about individuals who have started their business for $100. Along the way he dispel beliefs about startups and provides practical advice. This is exactly the kind of book a startup entrepreneur needs – full of real life examples, grounded advice on what works and a plethora of ideas that you can contrast against your own strengths.<br /><br />A comment on all the negative reviews about this book. The reader has to acknowledge that no one can hand them a platter of ideas with advice on how to execute. Instead what you must appreciate is the effort that has gone into the meticulous assembly of case studies, real life stories of entrepreneurs who are making their dreams come true right now. What could be more inspiring than that?
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I read Divergent in two days and Insurgent in one day. I pre-ordered this book and was over the moon when it arrived.  That feeling was to be short-lived.  The book is a departure from everything I loved about the first two in the series.  I actually felt at times that it was not written by the same author.<br />This books is not captivating at all.  It took me five days to read because I kept putting it down because I simply DID. NOT. CARE. I didn't care what happened next, I didn't care who said what, or who did what, or what the big secret beyond the city was.<br /><br />*** SPOILER ***<br /><br />I felt ALL of these things long before Tris died.  I'm not a reader who will criticize an author simply because I didn't like how the story ended.  TRUE - I didn't like how it ended, but I didn't like how it started either.  There was SO MUCH drama and excitement at the end of the 2nd book and I thought that same sense would be immediately picked up in the 3rd, however Roth takes you on a 70 page rabbit trail that will have you tearing your hair out. These first pages were so repetitive and un-necessary, I'm certain they never would have made it past an editor if the first book hadn't already been turned into a movie.  The success of this franchise clearly affected good editing, as it often does in super-successful franchises (True Blood for instance).<br /><br />If I could only use one word to describe this book, it would be LACKLUSTER. All of my friends who have already read this one agree - HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Do yourself a favor and get it on Kindle or borrow it - it's not worth $20 at the bookstore.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|As a creative coach who is inspiring clients to reach for creative methods to chart their careers, I have been researching how humans make decisions. I picked up Gladwell's book because I enjoyed his writing style in The Outliers.<br /><br />The anecdotes in the book are certainly interesting. They range from the world of Art to Sports to Law enforcement. Mr. Gladwell weaves the anecdotes into an interesting case for snap judgements. While I enjoyed the fast paced narrative style and the particular stories he chose to illustrate his theories, the end product appears to be fragmented and disjointed. He seems to be jumping all over the board contrasting decision making in the Art world (highly qualitative) to Pentagon war games (highly situational) in search of common patterns. As a prior reviewer pointed out at times he appears to be on the verge of formulating a unified theory of decision making but then the argument returns to the Kouros or Coke or one of the other stories, leaving the reader puzzled and dissatisfied.<br /><br />I have given this book 4 stars for a few reasons - There is no doubt about it, he is a storyteller! I enjoyed the broad spectrum of stories he included in the book. The book is a fun and easy read. The concepts are compelling and memorable - thin slicing, the Warren Harding effect. They have the &#34;stickiness factor&#34;.<br /><br />I would recommend the book for a novice who hasn't dwelled much on the process of decision making. For others who habitually makes decisions but are looking to tap into their creative or unconscious mind, this book provides no actionable steps to be able to do so. The most persuasive aspect of this book is that it raises awareness of the complexity of human cognition, which once you have acknowledged is bound to change the way you perceive and reach to the world.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. Woke up in the middle of the night to finish it.<br /><br />When's the movie? I can't wait.
0743201140|4.0|This is the original StrengthsFinder book by Marcus Buckingham and Donald Clifton. In an age when everyone was cheerleading setting goals to address “areas of opportunity” their book jump-started the strengths revolution.<br /><br />This is a book I highly recommend to all of my coaching clients because if you have allowed circumstances to steer you in the direction of your current career chances are that you have never given your strengths much thought. Be sure to absorb the concept in its entirety and allow yourself the luxury of introspection when it comes to naming and owning your strengths.<br /><br />Admittedly this book provides but an introduction to the process of discovering your own strengths. While I prefer the original version for Marcus’s compelling writing, the recent version by Tom Rath offers an access code to take the updated strengths finder test.
0316044695|3.0|Its a touching story of heroism. the Mans faith is inspiring in how it drives him to survive. It could've really benefitted from a professional writers editorial input..
B0063GORYU|3.0|Lots of fun in the single color mode, but how in heck does anybody win in multicolor mode. Incredibly difficult.
0684857219|5.0|This book was recommended to me for YEARS before I bought it, what a loss of opportunity! This book has reshaped how I weight train all together. It has made me more competent and efficient in just about every area of exercising. I am not a bodybuilder and can tell you that as an everyday 40 year old guy who enjoys weight training this book will make you more effective and offer better and safer results than watching other people at the gym or on youtube videos ever will. It truly is a MUST HAVE for anyone seeking to take their weight training to the next level, or just want to know that you are doing exercises effectively and safely.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|This male mannequin form was offered at a good price with quick delivery.  It is exactly as described. I use it to display my larger vintage sport coats, suits and outwear that I sell.
0321934318|5.0|I had some of Scott Kelby's other books prior to purchasing this one. So when I upgraded to Lightroom 5 it only made sense for me to go ahead and purchase this book. It reads just as easily as the other books he's written and is organized well enough that you can find any technique pretty easily.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think every one shod play this<br />because it has minions and and fun missions<br />and its Kinda tricky but some times easy
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|After a few months of owning this thing, I'm finding it useful for pushing youtube videos to my computer, but that's about it. You can stream Netflix with this, but I turned my Netflix streaming off because I wasn't using it enough to keep paying for it. Other than that, it's a nifty little device. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that setting it up is a little bit of a hassle as you have to have a computer with internet in order to setup. Should be out of the box ready in my opinion.
B00C7607BC|5.0|What's not to love! It's the little mermaid...It was a total reminder of how far we have come in this digital age...great movie!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed the book until the end. I almost feel like the end of the book ruined the entire thing. After reading all the great reviews on this book, I couldn't imagine that I would have been disappointed after I finished reading it. I would recommend this book but give them a warning that the ending may not be what you would expect and could ruin your opinion of it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game it is.fun I love the animals it is creative it is beautiful it is fun to see all tjendifilorant animals
B004RC8NUQ|4.0|Great movie saw this on my first date with my boyfriend after not having seen eachother in 13 years after we broke up in high school.  It was funny and romantic but with out being cheesy even my boyfriend liked it.  Great movie to watch
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The first truly riveting and unpredictable book I have read in ages. While the HBO series is great, it does the books no justice
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Stone nailed it. Despite what others say, this is the story behind that story.  A not to be missed well-researched analysis of one of the most powerful companies in the US today.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|I personally didn't think much of apps like this a few days ago. I thought they were scams and they didn't work. Well, much to my surprise, I was proven wrong. I was sitting on the couch yesterday and I decided to try and use this app. I opened it up, and, just as I expected, a dot appeared on the radar. I asked something along the lines of, &quot;Is anyone there? And if there is, give me proof.&quot; A few seconds later the app said my name, and then my brothers name(who was sitting a mere few feet away, and no one else was home). At this point I had something that resembled a panic attack and exited the app. Later, I again attempted to &quot;communicate with the dead&quot; and once more I was given evidence that this app is the real deal. This could be some freaky coincidence, but for some reason I highly doubt it. I highly recommend getting this app if there is some bizzare stuff going on around you, or one of your family members just died.

0143124544|5.0|I read this book in one day,<br />I cannot even begin to explain the emotions it brought out of me,<br />by the last few chapters I had to stop every 5 seconds because my tears would get in the way.<br />I had never cried so much in a book it's ridiculous.<br /><br />I saw true intimacy and love in a whole different perspective, I fell in love with Lou and Will.<br />i just finished the book yesterday and I am barely accepting the outcome of the story..<br />I cried cried and CRIED!!!!!<br />i had to call a friend to calm me down... i usually read books twice to understand it better and maybe even catch something i missed, but I cannot pick this book up again without falling apart in tears..
B0095R64AO|2.0|I love romantic comedies, but this is a long, boring bit of not-stop drudgery.  The few light moments in this movie are not worth the viewing.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Well by now Mrs. Bezos has made her opinion about this book pretty clear,<br /><br />(http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0T26SV0ELPP/ref=cm_cd_pg_oldest?ie=UTF8&asin=0316219266&authToken=&cdForum=Fx18PV6KGIRHZCU&cdPage=1&cdSort=newest&cdThread=TxYIXZIRIYXWQA&store=books#wasThisHelpful),<br /><br />which made it into the news big time.<br /><br />One example: (http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/jeff-bezos-wife-slams-new-book-amazon-gives-one-star-amazon/)<br /><br />So this is an explosive topic and sure profitable one for all parties involved...!<br /><br />But let me say this, I couldn't put this book down from the moment I got it.<br /><br />It's a great read, specifically how failure and mistakes did not deter Mr. Bezos in building one of the world's greatest internet empires!
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|What can I say? It's just a great pop-rock album. It has a pefect mixture of upbeat pop songs, ballads, and even a couple experimental songs like the electronic \\"Hello Kitty\\" (which isn't her best song, but it's still a cool change of pace) and the hard-rockin' \\"Bad Girl\\", and probably her most mature song \\"Give You What You Like\\". I find it to be a lot better than her last album \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" which was good, but had far too many ballads for my taste. I've only had this album for a few hours and already have listened to it all the way through a few times, and I like it better with each listen. In my opinion it's her best album since her debut \\"Let Go\\", which is still one of my favorite albums ever. Avril fans won't be dissapointed!
B003UESJF6|5.0|I've never been a big Will Ferrell fan (in fact, I quite loathe him in most movies) but I really liked this flick. It's a good movie for kids, but has enough jokes for adults to enjoy it too. Plus the soundtrack is quite bitchin' with lots of classic rock and most movies are made better with GnR. David Cross is also in it, and with the exception of his character in the Alvin and the Chipmunks movies, he is usually funny, so take that how you will.
B004V9MU86|5.0|I had pre-conceived ideas what this book would be like but wasn't prepared for the emotional journey that followed.  The story is told in a unique and moving way that holds your interest and takes you back in time to a world reeling with war and injustice.  We see it from a young girl's eyes and watch as the story unfolds.<br />I would recommend this book as an inspiration to everyone and particularly to those that have been fortunate to live a sheltered life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I get frustrated on how long it takes to get thru some levels but this game is so addicting. Just love it!!!
0440237688|3.0|I bought it for my 5th grader and it arrived promptly. He's not allowed to read ahead as part of a discussion group but so far he's intrigued.
B008XG1X18|5.0|There is so much to offer. I am not a fan of Facebook, twitter or any of those social medias. I feel it absorbs to much of time. I love the Pinterest! I have gotten so many great ideas and got to see things that I love without all the pop ups, spam, a million things to choose from that I can not figure out which is the right one. I can right to what I want to look at and get great ideas. Who ever thought of this THANK-YOU!!!
0307450570|5.0|I like the martha stewart craft books.  Some truely great craft ideas.  She explains how to complete tge project well.
0143038419|5.0|SOOOO good. A must read. Life is too short to read books that wont inspire you in some way. I read this book and it was the final inspiration I needed to write my autobiography. Thanks Liz! [[ASIN:0615874436 Taking Back The Pen: Resiliency Amidst Life's Predestinated Storyline]]
B008XG1X18|5.0|I never knew of pinterest till i got my kindle. I downloaded it one day &amp; from then on I fell in love!! I like how I can make my own boards. I can upload pictures as well. its all unique &amp; great I recommend to anybody! ! 5 stars! !
B004R1Q296|5.0|Possibly the best narrative history of any period, at least in modern English. Richly deserves all the accolades it has garnered over the years.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love, love, love this app!!  I have always enjoyed playing classic mahjong and this game is terrific!!  I'm sure I will have hours of enjoyment out of it!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is a book for ANYONE that has a complaint about this country or many countries not quite as good as ours is.  A story of the abuse people can take and somehow live though it. Shows the depths of existence and how human beings can bear it and sometimes rise above it.  The people that run that country are insane and have the bomb!
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I love this new adventure game and would recommend this game to anyone who likes hidden object plus adventure.  I don't like the ones without the adventure theme and mini games.
B000UD08HW|5.0|Absolutely beautiful concert. Excellent video and sound quality. Gilmour continues the impress and amaze. This man's music is a true treasure to musical culture. Fun side note, the guitar strap he wears during this performance once belonged to Jimmy Hendrix.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS GAME KEEPS ME LOCKED ON IT. I AM ADDICTED TO IT AND I LOVE IT. THIS GAME IS SOMETHING KIDS AND ADULTS LOVE.<br />Really a good game
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Amazing concert. One of those classics that just needs to be revisited every so often. Great to watch back to back with Gilmour's Remember That Night Blu Ray.
0800105141|4.0|Great historical portrayal by Ben Kingsley. If you're interested in seeing India,<br />this is the movie to watch and you have several free hours.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Classic movie, always great to watch. Tim Curry is the only one who can pull off Pennywise The Dancing Clown.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Heartwarming story set in an ungodly slum where people do the best they can to survive.<br />The children were wonderfully cheerful even though their lives were a living hell in comparison<br />to those lived by people in a richer world. Their world was rich.
B000003RCY|5.0|It's Rammstein, need I say more? Metal and ballads! Songs to pump you up and calm you down. You don't need to know German to love their music
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|A huge disappointment. So boring and predictable I could hardly get through it. Mr Grisham wrote two great books:  A Time to Kill and The Painted House. I hoped this would be the third. It is not.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great way to work on problem solving skills. love the colors. the music is funny and the crunch sounds are very satisfying.
B0000UJDLM|1.0|There's so many reviews of this that this one will probably get lost in the noise, but &#34;buyer beware!&#34;  This DVD is not anamorphic and so anyone with a widescreen TV (almost everyone, these days) will get a lot of black borders around every edge.<br /><br />Even at $5, do not get this version.  Spend a bit more money and get a better copy.
B004PAHZMC|4.0|Great case for Lego's, but now that my son's Lego collection is expanding, its now too small to hold TT hem. Otherwise, its cute and convenient. Keeps Lego's safe from middle of the night step on's.
0380729407|2.0|I read his first book and liked it, but this one was really rather strange.  The language is maybe too ornate and old fashioned?  Good writing, but just wasn't my cup of tea.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|I am a huge and longtime fan of EJ and Bernie's music.<br /><br />I purposely waited a few weeks to write a review because I wanted to let this one sink in. I have to admit -- this one is a difficult listen at first. The melodies aren't quite as \\"grabby\\" as the ones from Songs from the West Coast or The Captain and the Kid (what I consider to be his last two great albums). The tempos are slower and it definitely has a somber feel to it. I wasn't sure I'd be into the production style (I really miss the band, especially Davey Johnstone).<br /><br />And after a while, every single song on here got its hooks into me. They get in your head and don't let go. And they're great. The production is outstanding (EJ's piano never had such a rich tone on ANY recording). Bernie's lyrics are top tier (I think my favorite is \\"My Quicksand\\" -- what an awesome track!). And one of the coolest things is EJ taking solos and really playing creatively and loosely on the piano.<br /><br />You could call it a return to form, but I think since West Coast, he's really been creating some great stuff. I'd call it more of an evolution -- he sounds very comfortable and inspired to be making music that's this solid at this stage of the game. I'm certainly impressed, and I hope he keeps at it.
B00946WM6Q|4.0|Always have enjoyed the Bond series. This resets the character to portray a traditional spy and makes him more human, more tough guy. Some of the other portrayals were fun/campy (Roger Moore) or a bit metro-sexual (Pierce Brosnan). Plenty of action and a great story arc. Good fun.
B0065GC0PG|4.0|I was a tiny bit disappointed in this story, but I still did love it.  One of my favorite type of books to read are fairy tale retellings, and Cinder didn’t disappoint with that.  I have had this book on my TBR list for so long, I originally fell in love the cover, and now with three books in the series, so I thought I should make a start with them.<br /><br />I was not hugely into the cyborg part of the story, although it did make it original.<br /><br />Cinder had a lot going on, so much to focus on it was a bit crazy, The story was only a slight retelling of Cinderella, and extremely light on the romance, Hopefully in future installments this will changed, since Cinderella is a romance.<br /><br />I enjoyed the originality of the story, which being a retelling, was a huge plus, between the virus, aliens, cyborgs, hint of romance, action and of course an impending war.  Cinder has everything you could want in a story maybe  just a little too much, but I am looking forward to reading Scarlet.<br /><br />I recommend this book, for teens or adults of any age it is a wonderful original science fiction story.
B0056FMNYA|3.0|I wanted to love this belt, based on all the positive reviews, but it hurts. My main use for it would be on the soccer field while shooting my son's games. I mounted a 7d+grip+70-200 on it and while it hung ok on the belt, the plate that goes under the camera digs into my thigh. I was going to &#34;modify&#34; it and stick some kind of foam padding under the plate, but haven't had a chance to do it yet. I also used this belt with my 28-70 and it didn't dig as much, but still felt uncomfortable. I will keep it, since there will probably be some situations where it will be just what I need, but it doesn't work for what I wanted it to. Also, it would be nice to be able to remove the camera from the belt with one hand, rather than having to use two.
B000002AGN|5.0|This collection is Brubeck and Desmond at their best.  &#34;Blue Rondo a la Turk&#34; is, in my opinion, one of the best, if not the best, jazz compositions of all time, while &#34;Take Five&#34; is undoubtedly one of the most popular and recognizable tunes in the genre. The rest of the album is quintessential Brubeck and, for me, carries the joy of jazz to the very end.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is very fun for all children. I babysit a 1 year old, a 6 year old, a 9 year old, and a 14 year old and they all love it! It is unisex so everyone loves it
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Awesome storytelling of how a certain class of individuals play 'moral hazard' with the lives of others.  They are still getting away with it!
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a great calculator,it's nice and big,and easy to use check it out! Work's very well.you will love it !
B009AMALGM|5.0|Not gonna lie.....didn't like the ending as it means I have to wait for the next one.....lol....but it was worth it getting there.....if you like jumps....then watch this even the man in my life jumped....tis a keeper :)
B009G3T01M|5.0|This album is a refreshing change to Hip-Hop music which can sometimes sound repeditive.  This group has a unique Hip-Hop style and a very fresh and powerful sound.  If you like music that every song on the album doesn't sound like the same thing over and over, this is the album for you.  PS - The beats are pumping too.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I become The Waking Dead watching this series as I can't sleep til I see the whole thing....love love this show but need I say more....we all love it, its why its so popular.....and ok maybe for Daryl Dixon too ;)
B0084B5TK8|5.0|So sorry I waited so long to read this story! Once you begin reading...you can't stop until the end...no wonder it's a classic!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Has many different rewards and it keeps your attention. It is more fun than Tetris! I can not wait to play it over and over.
B001TH16DI|5.0|A must for any hard core Star Trek fan. I enjoyed them and the blu ray makes it so clear that the special effects are really impressive.
B002VLNB1Q|5.0|This is a really sweet song. The chord sequence & combination & guitar is very nice to listen to. Initially I purchase this MP3 ON October 10th but it only played for 1 minute & 29 seconds, the song length is supposed to be 4:28  I purchased again today November 5th and got a good copy.<br />The bass is a little too deep, highs could be higher, but overall it sounds great and I really love the song.<br />However, Amazon should varify that MP3s are actually full lenghth before making available for purchase.<br />This is the second half song that I have come across on the site.<br />Maybe this is a business strategy to make extra cash - Brilliant
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I have got a Neptune very fast (aprox. 1 week to Russia). And the Neptune Undrwater more better than Speedo playr for swim.<br />And of course there is a small negative - not work button play/pause on ear headphone(
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|So what if Channing Tatum is compared to Bruce Willis, he proves his chops as an action/adventure actor here with excelence. This film is a roller coaster ride of action, the writeing is good, the plot is good, and it even manages to talk about the Military Industrial Complex as a negitive force for world peace.  Thumbs up across the board!
B00BRUZ5WA|5.0|Let me first start off by noting that I discovered Brushy-One String by accident on a YouTube search. The FIRST attribute that struck me with this artist was his unique since of simplicity.<br /><br />With just ONE string in his guitar, he manages to capture the emotions that are needed to spur songs into the ears of his audience. Its almost  reminiscence of old reggae artists music, but only bettered through its simplicity. With the cries and almost blues-like hymns occasionally expressed in each tracks, the genres in this album are of multiple ranges.<br /><br />My favorite tracks would be:<br /><br />&#34;Grey in My Blue&#34;, Life is for Every Man&#34;,Destiny&#34; and &#34;War&Crime.&#34;<br /><br />With each of these tracks, the mood inflicted by his voice and &#34;one stringed&#34; guitar will surprise you. Overall I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone looking for something fresh and new.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I just finished SYCAMORE ROW.  This was truly a great read.  I live in the south and understand without hesitation that although this book is a novel and comes from the imagination of the author, it very easily could have been an actual story.  I hope beyond hope that my older relatives did not have the hatred and bitterness as Cleon Hubbard possessed, but as I said, I live in the Deep South and I know some unpleasant truths.<br /><br />Read this book, but realize that the end of the book might be uncomfortably true.
0062107313|5.0|I was really enthused by the pitch and Amy Tan carried on marvelously into the first chapter and subsequent ones. The book involves some research, which gave the story authenticity. However, the story bogged down in some places, interrupting what could have been a great flow. Overall, it is a deep story and the characterization came out right. In fact, snippets of it reminded me of Tatiana in the story [[ASIN:B004YDS38K Splendid Comets]]. Anyway, the book is a worthy read.
1451666179|4.0|If you are a fan of Allie Brosh's blog, help support her book.  Its just as enjoyable.  A mix of classics from her blog and new material make this a great book.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|There are not enough stations available in the areas I want to view. I wish I had known before ordering. I would prefer to be able to remove it and receive a refund.
B0071BGOJC|2.0|I liked the historic information  regarding the events, during this period. The novel part is no literary achievement, being even too childish in some cases. It's an easy read that helps understand what happened and why they took place.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I got other family and friends addicted to this game. I get stuck but I just keep trying and I finally get it.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|I would really, truly love to have a refund for this app. It is not at all what I thought it would be. It's basically a Clock which I already bought that for my Kindle Fire. You can remove this app. and refund the $2.99 back to me, Please&#62;&#62;&#62;
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I love it , have watched it several times , and I'm sure I will watch it many more<br />Thanks
B00881VLCE|5.0|After testing numerous jigsaw apps this one is outstanding.  It has the most traditional feel to it, almost as if the pieces were on a table.  I also appreciate the ability to vary the number of pieces depending on the difficulty level I want to play at. yep! This one is a winner!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King's books are always good, most are great.. this one is a notch above great. It relates back to The Shining (which is another stellar tale), picking up the hero's story a good while later.<br />I am definitely a fan of Stephen King, always have been and most likely always will be, but this stands out.<br />If you enjoy an outstanding read, get this.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|An excellent app, lots of features, there is a bit of a learning curve, but once you’ve learned the features, it is a very useful app!
B00C7607BC|5.0|I love this movie. It is one of my all time Disney favorites and isn't always available. I got the movie very quickly and it was at a reasonable price.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|Uses the same principal as ANGRY BIRDS, with a twist, a very fun game. Especially if you like ANGRY BIRDS.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Its definitely worth it. A page turner if there ever was one. I wait with baited breath for the sequels.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I found myself cheering when good things happened at the worst moments. great movie .<br />I loved the cinematography and writing , the score is also amazing , it gives it life.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|This is a great set.  More bonus material than US set.  There is no problem to play UK region free Blu-ray DVD with American Blu-ray player.  Other reviewer mentioned, that changing subtitles with remote does not work.  You have to open up the menu screen and change it there.  It is not a big deal for me.
B00ERIUO02|4.0|1. Roar: 3/5, It's an okay song. It's catchy, but it slightly annoys me.<br />2. Legendary Lovers: 4/5, This song is really different than what Katy normally does. I love how her voice sounds in this song, especially during the &#34;Take me down to the river&#34; part.<br />3. Birthday- 3.5/5, Fun, party song. The lyrics are a little corny, but it's really fun and catchy!<br />4. Walking On Air- 4/5, This song has a very 90's feel to it! It took a while to grow on me.<br />5. Unconditionally- 3/5, It's okay. The lyrics are sweet, but I don't love the song. I'm really surprised that this was chosen as a single.<br />6. Dark Horse- 5/5, This is one of my favorite songs. The beat is great! I think the song would be better without Juicy J.<br />7. This Is How We Do- 5/5, You can tell this song is produced by Max Martin (...Baby One More Time, Oops!...I Did It Again, 22, etc.)! The lyrics are a bit cringy at times (&#34;gettin' our nails did all Japan-esy&#34;), but it is irresistably catchy and fun!<br />8. International Smile: 3.5/5, Catchy beat, but the lyrics are pretty cheesy.<br />9. Ghost: 3.5/5, I think this song would be a lot better without the speaking/shouting part in the chorus. I like the lyrics and her voice sounds nice.<br />10. Love Me: 4/5, I think this song could be a hit! Her voice sounds great and I think everyone can relate to the lyrics.<br />11. This Moment: 4/5, This song makes me smile! The lyrics are<br />12. Double Rainbow : 5/5, The lyrics are very sweet. Her vocals really shine here.<br />13. By The Grace Of God: 5/5, My favorite song on the album! I love the piano. The lyrics are very beautiful, as is her voice.<br />14. Spiritual: 3/5, It's okay. It's a little bland.<br />15. It Takes Two: 5/5, A great track with sad lyrics.<br />16. Choose Your Battles: 4/5, I love the lyrics! The chorus is great, but the verses fall a little flat for me.
B002C949KE|5.0|Ariely uses practical examples to explain the irrational side of human behavior.<br />For anyone with an interest in what makes people tick, this is a must read.
B000JM645E|3.0|The movie came in perfect condition.  The movie itself was not as good as I remembered it to be back in 2005 or whenever it came out.  The quality left a lot to be desired (at least on my super high def tv).  I wish the movie was less to do with the trial and more to do with the actual possession also.  I didn't even remember that there was a trial from the first time I watched it.  That, I believe, speaks to how boring the majority of the movie is.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I have this game on all of my devices.  This is like an addiction, I can't wait to get my energy refilled...
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|It a copy of a Japanese story called Battle Royale. Look it up.<br />They just put it towards the future instead.<br />I don't like when they copy things and don't mention the original.<br />Crap but good acting with the main girl.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app it's so awesome I can save everything I want. I can save recipes,  DIY projects, clothes, etc.
B003XUKVXK|5.0|Great music very talented a joy to listen to saw them live and this CD is the next best thing
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's A FUN GAME AND FREE until you',re stuck. If you need help ,it cost you money for boosters to advance.<br />That,s not free is it ?
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|It introduced me to a whole new world of entertainment that I never knew existed. I loved it so much that I am wiling to watch it over and over again.
B0064MGU98|4.0|4.5/5 stars... The only reason it doesn't merit 5/5 stars is because it's  not \\"The Wire\\" or \\"Homeland\\". Those two are TV perfection.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/12/13 &lt;---haha! great date!:<br /><br />The show's title, \\"The Good Wife\\", is misleading. We picture a Betty Crocker soccer mom, a Stand-By-Your-Man-at-any-cost type wife, but this isn't the case. Even the comparison to Hillary is a bit off the mark. As the show progresses, we gets glimpses into Alicia's morality and how it changes in her process of becoming. I'm not saying that her change is as drastic as Walter White's in \\"Breaking Bad\\"[[ASIN:B00DTOYIIE The Transformation of Walt to Heisenberg]], but its an apt comparison, more so than Hilary. What we have with Alicia is a woman relatively devoid of strong life principles which would act as guides to her- in her lfe, her behaviour, her decisions. Other than wanting the best for her kids and wanting to protect them, she really has no other strong guiding principles, like the Personal Mission Statement that author Stephen Covey advised all of us to make in the '90's. The following quote applies to Alicia, and her generation of women:<br /><br />So, what do you want to be when you grow up? That question may appear a little trite, but think about it for a moment. Are you--right now--who you want to be, what you dreamed you'd be, doing what you always wanted to do? Be honest. Sometimes people find themselves achieving victories that are empty--successes that have come at the expense of things that were far more valuable to them. If your ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step you take gets you to the wrong place faster....[[ASIN:0743269519 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change]]<br /><br />Alicia finds herself going up such a ladder, a ladder now much higher thanks to the efforts of such women as Diane Lockhart who broke the glass ceiling. She can now go farther, achieve more, and reach the absolutely height of success. But at what cost? \\"The Good Wife\\" title is a moral Gordian knot, a M&ouml;bius strip travelled internally, where no matter where Alicia goes, there she is, again and again and again, in a never-ending loop, with nothing to guide her but sheer effort and cutthroat ambition.<br /><br /> The fact that Alicia doesn't divorce her husband has almost nothing to do with her standing by her man or whether she loves him or not; but has everything to do with her moral laziness. It's not even that she just hasn't gotten around to making up her mind; she just does NOT have any internal guidance either way. The title \\"The Good Wife\\" implies morality; that marriage is something sacred, ordained by God. But for Alicia, not divorcing her husband after he slept with prostitutes is neither \\"Good\\" or \\"Wifely\\". She just doesn't have anything deep inside herself to help her out of it. She is morally bereft, but not quite bankrupt. She is our generation; the generation who threw away God when we tossed out religion. Oops! In our efforts to be Enlightened, we traded success for our souls.<br /><br />We seem to love these morally-challenged characters:  the aforementioned Walter White, brilliantly portrayed by Bryan Cranston in \\"Breaking Bad\\" and the irresistible character in \\"Mad Men\\"[[ASIN:B00C94I8FY The Doorway Part 1]]  as Jon Hamm did with Don Draper/Dick Whitman, the son-of-a-whore Madison Avenue big shot. We develop these mini-crushes and then, too late, we realize that such characters, while charming, are really horrible, manipulative people, even dangerous. This makes us question ourselves, for who would be drawn to such people if not for our own internal shortcomings and missing pieces? Maybe this show could be called  \\"Missing Pieces\\". It'd be more accurate than \\"The Good Wife\\", or at least less deceptive.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />That said, The Good Wife is excellent TV, and leaves us  enriched after viewing. The acting is top-notch, with especially glittering performances by Archie Punjabi & Matt Czuchry, who both captivate viewers with unique mannerisms and endearing charm. The other principals, Chris Noth, Alan Cumming & Mary Beth Piel as Jackie, the evil do-gooder, could each have volumes written about them. They each add their own unique spice to the Masala. Although Cummin doesn't convince me as a Jew or as hetero, he compensates with his quirkiness, which plays beautifully here. But I'm beginning to think that this is their point: don't prejudge based on exteriors. And the casting for the kids is perfect; Graham Phillips and  Makenzie Vega put their whole heart into every scene. Josh Charles brings to the bad-boy role a nice helping of sophistication and class not easily found elsewhere. And the striking Christine Baranski, with her flair for style cannot be topped. That's why, I suspect, she IS at the top, the woman in charge, the one all the rest of us must pay gratitude to for breaking the glass ceiling. The great thing about this is, of course, that she has done this very thing with her acting career, and the mere fact that she is a principal in this show proves the point. Growing up (im 50) I can't recall one show I watched with an older woman in power as lead. Having her elegance every episode makes this such a pleasure! Plus, she's gorgeous. I love her pert little nose and her laugh. This cast has The Best Laughs, with Julianne Margulies first. Hearing her laugh is good for the soul.<br /><br />Yet, it's  truly the writing I enjoy most, with current events mirrored in every episode. It's so well scripted, with my only complaint  that there's only been one two-parter. I'd like to see more episodes linked  together, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. They've covered Bitcoin, online search engines (theirs is called ChumHum, not Google or Yahoo!), social media (Patrick Edelstien, not Mark Zuckerberg), unmanned drone strikes, and all the current social issues like racial bias, sexual harassment, and classist issues. A bit of everything legal, very well canvassed. It's also smart, and demands that the background of the viewer be both broad and well-rounded: while Alicia is waiting and waiting with another lawyer, played so brilliantly by Micheal J. Fox, when there is finally a knock at the door, Alicia says, \\"Oh! And there's Godot.\\" Only a well-read/educated viewer knows that the context implies Beckett's existential play, Waiting For Godot.<br /><br />The score is interesting. The first season, it reminded me of the music for Pixar's film, Finding Nemo, all floaty and watery. Then, it somehow changed in the following seasons, with the title score not having such a clear indication of an ending...which is reflected in the show. One must listen closely, pay attention, and figure things out on one's own. The rest of the music is great. As an older person, I have to use SoundHound to i.d. the tracks I really like, which I do almost every episode.<br /><br />And I love the costuming, being the girl I am! They make officewear interesting, both sexes. While Kalinda's outfits are racy and fun, I have difficultly believing that she'd wear almost exactly the same thing day in and day out. Short leather jacket, skirt just above the knees, and leather boots. Always the leather boots. Doesn't she ever wear pants? Or another type of shoe wear? How many pairs of high leather boots does the woman own?!? And her hair is always up in some fashion. Once, while she was arguing with a leggy blond, I noticed that their hair style was identical. That wouldn't happen, and so it is unbelievable.<br /><br />When things like that occur, it takes the viewer's focus off the content of the show, and the show looses some of its credibility. I noticed another distraction, but not due to hair or wardrobe. Eli Gold and his female adversary were out for drink, hot drinks, coffee with whipped creme. In each shot, the level of the whipped creme changed, and not as you'd expect. Well, once it was lower from the prior shot, but way lower, too low. And then, the next shot showed the whipped creme back in perfect form atop a full cup. Maybe using whipped creme in drinks should be disallowed. It's too difficult to manage in a TV show with all its multiple shots and angles and such. That's my one big complaint, and if THATs all I have to say negatively, then The Good Wife should still make it onto  your viewing schedule, don't you think?<br /><br />Julianne Margulies is perfect.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|With my job I need all the help I can get to on time. This app does a fine job of that! Very nice.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|UPDATE: I wasted my last review grieving over the loss of most of the song Saved By Love due to Amazon MP3 messing up, but figured I should do a proper review.<br /><br />When Stryper themselves said they felt this was their best material to date - they weren't kidding! Their previous original album \\"Murder By Pride\\" still had a bit of the \\"Reborn\\" album sound attached. For those who didn't hear that album, Stryper was leaning more towards an alternative rock style which was unbecoming of a Stryper album in my personal opinion. Although that album had memorable songs and great hooks, it just didn't feel like Stryper. Here, Stryper really take it back to their roots while keeping it modern in tone and in mixing.<br /><br />Track by track:<br /><br />(NOTE: It's a bit redundant to praise the solos in a Stryper album because they've always been great at naturally weaving them into their songs. Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed with the solos here.)<br /><br />1. \\"Revelation\\" - A heavy ballad of sorts with an incredible opening. I found it odd that the album started with this one considering they usually push out the heavy hitters right off the bat. Nonetheless, it still gets the job done by hooking you with it's grand intro and catchy chorus accompanied by the angelic harmonies of the layered vocals. Stryper are pros at this, it's scary good. The solo is on the tamer side but fits naturally into the flow of the song. Not too over-the-top and not underwhelming. Song closes with the epic opening riff.<br /><br />2. \\"No More Hell To Pay\\" - This song is understandably heavy handed in both riff progression and drumming pattern. Funny how it follows the theme of the song when its speaking on walking through this life with opposing voices and forces always weighing you down yet continuing to follow your path until there's \\"No more hell to pay\\". Michael Sweet gets to show off his vocal chops early-on in the pre-chorus, instantly reaching high notes with no warning. It's a great feat for his age. All in all a great song you'll be singing along to in no time flat.<br /><br />3. \\"Saved by Love\\" - This song is the most old-school sounding in the bunch in my opinion. Fast paced, raw, and aggressive. Stryper can still do all of these with perfection. Michael Sweets screams during the chorus compliment the mood so well it gets you pumped!<br /><br />4. \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" - I have to be honest. I didn't get the album \\"The Covering\\" since I'm usually annoyed when bands do covers. Although, Stryper did an amazing job with \\"Shining Star\\". The same has to be said with this Doobie Brothers original \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\". They made it their own and not just by making a chord by chord remake. They made new riffs and progressions and even a breakdown. This is a great tribute to this song. Also the dueling guitars in the solo had me salivating... I can definitely tell when Michael is playing and when Oz jumps back in. They work so well together while at the same time having their own style and approach. It's fun to listen to these to duel. Even more fun live! =)<br /><br />5. \\"The One\\" - An intimate ballad with some great verse riffs courtesy of Oz Fox. The pre-chorus is a classic slow walk down that Stryper ballads are almost naked without and I love it! It leads into the heavenly harmonic \\"ooohs\\" that mimic the intro lead guitar hook. It sounds so great I had to re-play this song over 5 times on the first listen to hear it again! This song is so full of passion and love, I have to say that this rivals \\"Honestly\\". I couldn't tell you which one I love more, and I'm okay with that.<br /><br />Unfortunately I currently don't have time to post more but rest assured the rest of the album has just as much care, thought, passion, and perfection poured into it. This is a must have for all Metal fans.great feat for his age. All in all a great song you'll be singing along to in no time flat.<br /><br />3. \\"Saved by Love\\" - This song is the most old-school sounding in the bunch in my opinion.

B000GWE44U|4.0|Can't fault the movie, five stars for sure. The movie is just the disc and case, kind of like right out the bin at Wal-Mart. Either way, solid purchase.
B00062PN6I|5.0|i love these headphones because they have nice solid bass and their overall good quality. for ten bucks these are actually worth it. recommend for anyone.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Watched this movie with my family and really enjoyed it.  Really does a good job portraying teenage angst in very blunt terms that teenagers identify with.<br /><br />One unlikely super hero, Kickass, starts the super hero scene, where he encounters the real deal in an 11 year old and her dad.<br /><br />Don't want to spoil the rest, but it is a really fun movie that everyone will laugh at.<br /><br />There is a lot of blood and violence.  Movie doesn't pull any punches (no pun intended) but that is better than the other actions films which are less 'realistic'. Definitely doesn't over glorify violence. Strong language that made my wife blush, but more in the beginning than throughout. Sets the tone for the movie.
B00514HDNW|1.0|The book is missing a whole section.  I am trying to resolve the problem but I would advise not to purchase the book.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|The problem with rating here is they make you write something. How can we be expected to write anything clever after reading a whole book of perfection? Too much pressure. Just buy this book and read it, you'll like it a lot.
B00D2HTRVQ|1.0|My daughter loves this game. Only thing is it that it keeps crashing.  I've tried looking for where I could delete it and then download it again. There is nowhere to do that though.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A really good law/Southern story with twists and turns.<br />The characters were richly portrayed, except for the lead lawyer's family.<br />It would have been five stars if the family histories were edited a bit.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|It was ok. not a fan of Iron Man but liked Robert Downey Jr as an actor in other films.  Hope they make part II with other superheroes. Keep Captain America and dump Iron Man.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Any fairy tale is a great choice. This is really a different approach but worth viewing. The costumes and dramatics are great. Again Prime Amazon came through with a great choice.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I thought this film was going to be cheesy so I didn't watch it in the theaters but I rented this one because I liked Norse mythology.  Loved, loved it.  Actors were perfectly cast especially Tom Hiddleston. He is Loki.  Kudos to Ken Brannagh for this movie. Am going to buy and add to my library.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Nice family movie. Gentle, emotional and touching.  When you feel like a nice quiet evening and there is nothing on Amazon Prime provides this.
B00B89LZ4C|2.0|The detail on the figure looks great.....But the damn thing doesn't stand up...!! It falls over backwards.... The blister packaging was open as well...... The only reason it gets two stars is because of the detail..... Other than that.... Giant fail..........
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved every book in the series.  Watched the movie. Identified with it as an adult. Excellent read and fun and exciting.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I believe my expectations were too high for this book. I was just depressed the whole time I was reading it. I had to force myself to finish it because I kept wanting to find another book. This was a terrible ending to a potentially great series. :(
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Men in Black is always good.  Fun watching and a lot of laughter.  Like the actors.  Go for it. You will like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|About time Kindle Fire got the games of games!!!! Its fun and enjoyable!!! HOURS UPON HOURS!!! Fun is an understatement!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Always a good choice for Christmas season. Amazon Prime allows you to view this one free.  Great for children.  Watch.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Loved the Audry Hepburn version but who can resist Harrison Ford?  Even though Sabrina's actress may not have compared with Audrey, I still love the movie as much as the original ( I own both).  He makes a realistic overbearing, controlling older brother and it's a favorite for chick flik night.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|One of the best musicals .  Love drama put to music.  Great fun.  If you have not seen it, watch it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Requires in game purchases to fully enjoy it. Graphics a r e good but game is quirky and sometimes crashes when loading.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched all the episodes at one time as do not like  &#34; to be continued&#34;  Husband enjoyed this one with me.  Very good to the period. If you have not watch, do.
0316204366|5.0|If  you enjoyed Outliers, Blink, and The Tipping Point you will assuredly enjoy David and Goliath as well. Gladwell has a way of bringing in real world examples from interesting times throughout history to explain how and why things that seemed unlikely or impossible at the time were actually not that big of a surprise after all.
B008476HBM|5.0|Always a classic and aways will be . For men and woman and children. Enjoy a story that has stayed thru the ages.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|bought this title for my 14 year old sister for her birthday earlier this year. She says it's a good movie and likes it alot.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|A great movie featuring 2 great actresses, actors. Very realistic to old people like me. Liked the bed rooms scenes.
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|Action packed and some great witty conversation included, Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx make this an awesome movie!  Saw it in the theaters and loved it then, bought it on-demand and its still great the second time around!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Kind of silly. Children will like it. Plot is simple  Would now want to enjoy it with other adults as not really an allegory meaning.
B00009EJC5|5.0|You can't go wrong on this compilation of funk.  \\"It's a New Day\\" sets the mood, somewhere between an almost Latin swing, Unabashed funk, and the \\"sanctified\\" church sound.  \\"Give it Up or...\\" is terrific. It's the mix that was used on the \\"Sex Machine\\" album, originally on King.  My only objection with this one is that it is a bit heavy on the two & four, and we don't quite get the same sense of power with the congas.  Where we get it all is on \\"Talkin' Loud & Sayin' Nothin'.\\"  This knocks me out, just as it did when I bought the \\"There It Is\\" LP in 1972.  JB is just really full of the funk when he says, \\"Good Luck to You, Mr. Loud and Wrong.\\"  There are, perhaps, two cuts on this disk that I'm not crazy about.  \\"I gotta' Move\\" is a bit overly long, although the bridge is really \\"down.\\"  The other is the up-tempo remake of \\"Hot Pants.\\"  It's well done, but too long, and it wears thin after a few times through.  The original \\"Hot Pants,\\" on People, was a groove, and low down.  O, by the way, \\"Get up, Get Into It, and Get Involved\\" is fun.  It honestly sounds like everybody got together, in a garage someplace, and laid down this obvious first take.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Such a fun game and so glad it's finally on Kindle! Very addictive! So happy to be able to share this with my friends!
B008F5Y7UQ|4.0|A great movie! It will tug at your heart strings. Great story. Wonderful acting. grabs you upfront  and holds your attention to the last moment. Adventure, Humor, and romance . Try this one ... You will like it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The only reason this book got 1 star is because I couldn't rate it any lower. I hated it and will not recommend it to anyone.
B007EW6GX2|4.0|It's so thrilling the excitement will build up in you and you'll not stop reading it and it will blow your mind
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a great game. You have no ads we have to contend with which is great. There is nothing I can think of to improve this game.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved it it was great. This was one of the best books I've ever read. Buy it now. Ok
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|This brings back memories of watching the original series, but in so much more vivid picture.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and will watch it again and again. Not only is the action solid, it has plenty of peaceful serenity to catch you off guard while still stuck on that last scene.  I highly recommend it, though be sure you know what you are getting into before you dive headfirst into it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the game temple run 2. It is the kind of which it's hard to explain how but just try it and I promise you that you will love it it might not be a game that you will be playing all the time. But it won't be a very bad game that you don't like. I promise you that.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This picks up right where the first one left of and continues the story.  Not only that but a few more added tidbits. I really like how they improved upon Ramiel, (Originally the 5th, but in the Rebuild series the 6th angel.).  No longer is it confined to a mere simple octahedron form.  The attention to detail is just as thorough as the first installment and I highly recommend it.  I eagerly await the release of the third installment.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I never get tired of this movie. There must be a little bit of Ferris in me - I just love how he gets away with all those ridiculous antics, makes all the adults look like idiots, has the most impossibly awesome day, and still has sage words of advice for all of us.
B00309DC1M|4.0|Loved the movie and really enjoyed learning how the movie was made. Aurora is my 3 year olds favorite princess. She asks to watch it every day.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I'm thoroughly impressed with this writers ability to actually cause a visceral reaction in the reader. Well written, marvelous plot and beautiful characters direct me to read more from author.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|He's back. Thank god. This is the real Eminem. His past three albums were, uhh, something else. Recovery was on the right path but now he's ready to kill all the other rappers out there with Kendrick.
B005HGKWLO|5.0|Great movie.....Loved it...... must see for a good chick movie......check it out, rent it for a great Sunday afternoon movie
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the game it just sucks that you have to wait so long after you run out of lives
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'm still trying to understand what happened here... nothing about this book makes sense.<br /><br />To say I'm completely and utterly disappointed in Allegiant is an understatement of the highest caliber. I spent most of the time wanting to throw my Kindle out the window.<br />Yeah... not good. I waited over two years for an epic conclusion to this series and instead I feel I was shortchanged. I went into this book thinking it would be non-stop action and all-around badassery. I didn't get that at all. Instead, I suffered through a ridiculously hole-ridden plot that barely made sense. The question I asked myself for the first 40% of this book was, &#34;Sooooo, what was the point of the first two books then?&#34;<br />In Divergent, I absolutely LOVED both Tris and Four. Insurgent had me pissed off at Tris for the majority of the book. Allegiant made me want to punch Tobias/Four for the first 70% and I completely blame Veronica Roth for that. She almost re-wrote his character and turned him into a douchebag and it didn't work for me. I'm trying to figure out if it was to add angst or drama in an otherwise lacking plot.<br /><br />Oh! The &#34;plot&#34;... I. Don't. Get. It. At all. The end of Insurgent was such a cliffhanger and it seemed like Allegiant would pick up right where it ended and we'd be shown complete and utter turmoil. Sorry, to disappoint you, but that's not going to happen. We get a lot of nothing and lame explanations for WHY the factions are in place... genetics, perfection, blah blah blah.<br /><br />For the first 30% I was scratching my head and repeating, &#34;WTF?&#34; in between bouts of fighting sleep. NOTE: I finished the first two books in this series in less than a day. This one took me THREE DAYS to get through. There were many times I wanted to give up because it felt like the book was either:<br />a) Never going to end.<br />or<br />b) Have absolutely no conclusion whatsoever.<br />And oh how I wish I had DNF'd this one! Or maybe I wish I had come across the ending spoiler because I'd have known I was wasting my time. But I gave Roth the benefit of the doubt and stuck it out. I had no idea she'd piss me off and make me despise the series.<br />Some of the secondary characters add absolutely no value to the story. It feels like they're there &#34;just because&#34;.<br />Christina, Uriah, Peter... POINTLESS. Even in the end, they have no major role they played in this contrived disaster. And then there's Evelyn. Once again, Veronica Roth fails. Someone as power hungry and controlling as this woman cannot change who she is in a split second decision. Except in fiction. This all happens at the end, when all the &#34;BIG&#34; things are finally happening. Which, btw, isn't any major battle. It feels like a lesson in church or a moral message that we're supposed to appreciate and find comfort in. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK! I am bummed to think that Roth sold out and went for shock value instead of an ending that made sense. I cannot support such a ridiculous decision or rate this book high because I liked the prior books. It's an all-around mess and instead of saving it with a great ending, Roth went in the wrong direction.<br />The good about this book? One line stands out the most for me.<br />&#34;I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.&#34;<br /><br />Honestly, it blows my mind that *THIS* book was published with *THIS* ending... who decided this was a good idea and that it was the only way it would work? I'm looking forward to seeing all the backlash and explanations from the author.I had come across the ending spoiler because I'd have known I was wasting my time.

B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a great Match-3 game. Beautiful color in HD, too. Have to think when playing, not too easy of a game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Love this story! Great to have on my kindle to read to my son...and read it myself over and over again. This is an unabridged version and I haven't found a typo yet!
B008S2BZ10|5.0|This movie is an absolute classic. A must see for any sci-fi, action or Schwarzenegger fan. And He'll be back.
B0083Z614S|5.0|One of my favorites to read to kids or to myself over and over. I don't think this is an abridged version and it has only a few minor typos. Such a great book to have on my kindle!
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Listening to Jack Johnson and your stress will melt away....Awesome CD, will put you in the right kind of mellow mood, even on your &#34;worst day&#34;
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|One of my favorites! This is great to read to the kids or while on a long trip. Few typos!
B00EKXDVOK|4.0|Warning-this is NOT a new album.It's a compilation of her two previous Christmas albums.If you own those,you don't need to buy this one.But what's included here-especially the cuts from &#34;A Christmas Album&#34;-is wonderful.This is Barbra at her best!
B009EHDU7U|4.0|It reminded me of a Swedish version of Forest Gump and had me laughing out loud in places. Oh that we should all lead such busy and exciting lives!
B008JFUS28|5.0|Lucky enough to be invited by an early screening friend and I can not thank her enough because the movie is an EXCELLENT ride! Yes, the action is non-stop - are we surprised, NO, find \\"things flying by too fast?\\", NO. It grabs you and doesn't let go. Cast really takes the script and runs full tilt with it. Fun dialogue - Loki gets the best lines in my opinion. Christopher Eccleston rocks the bad guy role (continues to prove that the casting directors of Dr. Who really know how to find talented actors and rocket them forward). Kat Dennings continues to provide scene steeling finesse. Stellan Skarsgard fans really get to enjoy A Lot more of corporeal Stellan, what great legs! Pre-request shirtless scene of our hero doesn't disappoint and well Hiddelston is just as deliciously sexy with that smile and wit. one of the most entertaining fight scenes I've ever watched is nestled in this flick and I've truly not laughed so hard at a brawl since Blazing Saddles and Mongo. If you don't have the bucks to do the theater movie experience or patience to put up with obnoxious movie goers definitely this a great movie to pre-order! I so am!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|A very enjoyable read, I cannot wait to devour more of the series, at this book has definately whet my appetite
B00466HN6S|3.0|I expected better since I LOVED Despicable Me.  This is a cute movie, but gets boring in the middle and seems like it drags on.
B00CLIJ9A6|4.0|Watched this one with my husband, who didn't expect much.  We were both thoroughly entertained.  Maggie Smith is brilliant as always, and Billy Connolly is a refreshing surprise in his role.  Lots of laughter, gentle and outright.  Very touching moments.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|John Mayer gets better every CD he puts out. I've got about all he's got out and I think they're great. Buy some if you've never listened to him I'm guessing you'll like it. It's a kinda' easy going Bluesy thing going on.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|My grandsons love playing this game! I have not played, but the kids do love it. The girls are now learning
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Creepy, yet satisfying...now I'm anxiously awaiting the third book. I'm so glad I didn't discover this series sooner I don't think I can take the cliffhanger much longer. Write faster! :)
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|I CHOSE THE FOUR STAR RATING, BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A PEN OR PENCIL WHEN I WANTED TO WRITE SOMETHING DOWN.IT IS VERY CONVENIENT. THANK YOU
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Read the book. Enjoyed the movie. It's an engrossing watch. The movie shouldn't be the same as the book, it'd be impossible to replicate but they did a strong job on the movie anyway.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Trying this game again on my kindle fire HD. Had it on my kindle fire and lost all my progress when I accidentally deleted it. Let's try this again! LOL! :)
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This movie is one of my favourites from my childhood. The price was great (we almost bought it elsewhere for nearly double) & the quality is wonderful. Exactly what you'd expect from Amazon & Disney.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am so addicted to this series and have bought each season just incase I missed something!!!  LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Bought this CD because it included the disc & a digital download as well, which ended up costing less than just purchasing the digital download. Sound quality is very good on both the disc & the download. The selection if songs is also very good, especially compared to other compilations that are out there.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun game to play. Only down fall is that it Almost forces you to purchase certain items though. You can just keep hunting. You actually run out of chances and they want you to purchase more chances
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a great game. Minecraft<br /> Pocket Edition is one of the best games ever!<br />It has lots of cool stuff that I can use
0671449028|5.0|My son who is almost two loves this book and has for the last 8-10 months!!! He loves to point out the moon and always wants me to pretend to scrub his tummy on the bath page. It is a fun, playful story! Had to buy a second book because we wore out the first one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush is a very fun game. it is addicting but still so much fun. I would highly recommend it.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|What a great deal. Three seasons of Downton, all together, for such a good price. It's just the greatest story, too. Watching all episodes consecutively was quite a treat.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|They should put that it is a trial and not &#34;free&#34; This should be something stated clearly.  It is not free.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very gripping. As exciting as the first book, The Hunger Games. Can`t wait to read the next one very soon.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This is such a brilliant show. It's smart and witty, and the characters are great. I loved that Steven Moffat took a Victorian character put him into modern day life. Another opportunity to make a new generation fall in love with the genius that is Sherlock Holmes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved the series.  I HATE that you force me to tell you why.  Your rating system sucks!  STOP IT!!!
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|This novel won the Man Booker Prize in October -- and rightfully so. The plot is worthy of Shakespeare, as are many of the confused identities and assumed names. In style it is like something by Thackery, Dickens, Trollope, or George  Eliot. It is a Victorian novel written today.  The closer one gets to the end of the book, the longer the chapter headings or summaries get; and the shorter the parts and chapters get. The reader will absolutely not know what is really going on until the very last chapters.  The plot circles from beginning to a middle to end. Read slowly, as the author, I think, meant one to do; and savor every minute of being in 1860's New Zealand.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|My husband and I watch thise show religiously. Shipped fast and was in brand new condition. It was a great gift for him.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am obsessed with this game!  But only gave it 4 stars because I don't like that they are always trying to get you to buy something.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I enjoy the mix between a run based game and a shooting gallery,  It mixes more skill into the mix to keep it interesting.
0744014956|5.0|Great guide!  Very very thorough and nice quality.  Hard cover with nice thick color pages.  Lots of details on missions and locations for all the various items.  Side quests are here in high detail. Very nice book!
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|I love the spontaneity...capture life as it presents itself.  Like the work of the Photographic Historian, Brandon is a Cultural Photographer sharing moments in time; real life in New York.  Great work; beautiful and ...unstaged.
006202406X|3.0|I love the characters and the story. I'm not happy with the ending, not that I was looking for a entirely happy one.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Great show, good season.  Can't wait to watch the next one.  Definitely a good addition to the Dexter time line.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|The game is a lot more fun than I thought. It is hard to keep up with all the customers but it is not boring. I hate that you have to buy more levels and characters to help you though. :(
B0091TGWYE|5.0|The Snug suede case for the iPhone 5 series is a well-made, beautiful, thin protective case that allows the user to protect the phone while not in use and then to use the phone in its original beauty (5c neon colors or classy 5s gold) when it is in use.  The suede is top quality and the stitching is sturdy.  The case features a slot for a credit card.  It is not called \\"Snug\\" by accident.  The phone slides snugly into the case and will not fall out, shake it as hard as you will.  I have not dropped the phone while in the case, but given the quality of the product I am confident that it will protect the phone if dropped.  The unit features a strap that allows you to eject the phone 1/4 of the way out for easy retrieval.  The first one that I had was a bit too snug, in fact, but the company has excellent customer service and shipped me another one immediately.  The second one works great.<br /><br />I should add that as a man I appreciate the thinness of the case because I can put it in my pocket easily and unobtrusively and I thus do not need to buy one of those holster type cases for the belt.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad it's finally on Amazon. Now I can play it on my kindle fire and have my<br />progress sync with my Facebook account.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome book. Glad to have a ending to Doc's life. Could not put it done. Can't wait to read another Stevn king novel.
B0015XASFS|5.0|the whole show & the quality was just fantastic **** so was Josh :0  all round brilliant sound quality i felt like i was actually there
B00080EU58|5.0|A very nice change of pace from a great band and a great follow up to their amazing second album.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|very good but i felt there was too much in non english which was a bit disappointing but joshes voice makes you forget alot of that some great songs on this though
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Another great album from a great band.  A matured sound with deep seeded anger and sadness in almost every song.
B000I5X81K|5.0|love his lyrics in so many of the songs  plus his depth of feeling for this music Josh has, plus there was some surprises which were brilliant  just a great CD
B0091W6QZG|4.0|An interesting flicker, excellent detail. Touched frequently on flashes of life while I was growing up and old, This presentation filled in a lot of blanks in my knowledge of Mr. Hughes. The bits of real video meshed with excellent computer video made for good entertainment. I 'spose we won't know more about what really happened to him for another fifty years. A good movie !
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I liked this book because it is funny cute and historical at the same time .it was also the best book I have ever read!
B000OVLIQU|5.0|This wasn't written by some academic researching or a journalist interviewing old &#34;sources&#34;, this is the memories of a man WHO WAS RIGHT THERE with the Beatles when most of their songs were recorded. Invaluable.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Wonderful look at much of the current research as well as some revealing case studies exemplifying the qualities needed to succeed in school and in life.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I do not have time to write much because I am getting ready to read the final chapter.  I just want to say, I love this book!  I highly recommend it and cannot wait to read more of Liane Moriarty.<br /><br />Update since I finished the book:  I am THANKFUL for good books to read. I prefer fiction, and if you enjoy witty, \\"can't put it down\\" books, I highly recommend the one I just finished, \\"The Husband's Secret\\" by Liane Moriarty. This book really makes you think about all the little things that happen in our lives, the choices we make early on and as we go, even the tiny ones, and the consequences based on those little details, and especially how our decisions affect others. I will definitely be reading some of her other books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|But there's nothing more to ask for from this story of two teenage cancer stricken lovebirds. You fall in love with them individually and together and ride the rollercoaster with them with many emotions. If I can promise you one thing, is you will need tissues. Honestly this has been my favorite book of all time. I will read it again, and more than likely cry again. Highly recommend. xx
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I laughed so hard I cried. Allie Brosh has a unique gift to write and illustrate (in the most hilarious way) the things that we all think but are too afraid to say out loud. There was only one issue I had with the book - it was too short!! I hope that Allies writes another book! Thank Allie for this book and all of your posts.
B005U9REU0|5.0|Classic. For some reason, teenage girls think Bowie is the cutest thing as the Goblin King. Maybe it's the leotards. Good movie, good music.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This story is amazingly well written. I enjoyed the raw characters &  how they each draw you into themselves. You really feel their turmoil & struggle, the ending was beautifully played and it really makes you think about how one simple act in your life, can impact that of another.
0375869026|5.0|Thoughtful and sensitive view  of life with a serious handicap.  Should be read by all teenagers and parents.  Language is right on the adolescent voice
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Trying to get RID of the jellies, really GEL ME UP.:) In-other-words, It's not as delicious as a cup of fruitcocktail-JEL-LO-HELLO!:)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i thought this app was so cute and fun i couldnt stop playing it  it was addicting i think it is funny how you collect bananas and the options are wonderful
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I like more silly love songs and these songs are meant for the new Mrs. McCartney &#34;and what's wrong with that , I'd like to know&#34;
B004YRSC7I|5.0|Awesome mystery. flawed character suffering from a traumatic experience that haunts him psychologically. whats not to love. great story. going to watch it again soon!
B007L96VCY|5.0|Masterful and simple, It takes me back to a time when the world was evolving from the sixties to the seventies and Paul was leading the way.
B00499QUK2|3.0|So, this is the first of the \\"modern, updated\\" versions of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson.  Benedict Cumberbatch is the self-professed sociopath title character.  His Holmes is like bits of broken and shattered pieces of brightly colored and varying materials.  The colors and patterns are brilliant put together to make a fascinating picture - but edges are sharp and would cut you except for the fact that they are safely sealed in the grout.<br /><br />Martin Freeman (another terrific English actor) - who is more like pieces of sea glass - worn down and muted by the way he has been tossed about in his life, yet still solid, strong with a quieter kind of beauty.  His Watson aches at the past but is open to a happy present and future.  While Cumberbatch is loud, Freeman whispers.  You may be impressed by Holmes but you care about Watson.  You rarely see actors that can draw such empathy.  But Martin Freeman is expert at it.  Cumberbatch may be the heart, but Freeman and is the soul of the show. It's their playing off of each other that makes this worth watching.<br /><br />The biggest issue with this production is the writing.  It is unfathomable with today's advance forensics that Scotland Yard would not be able to solve these crimes on its own.  Yet, we are to suspend disbelief to provide this stage for a character that is now an anachronism, out of place in the 21st century with its advances in technology and criminology training.  That insults the viewers intelligence.  They should have this Holmes going to the next level - perhaps figuring out problems of a global, national security nature.<br /><br />But, in the very capable hands of Cumberbatch and Freeman and a great supporting cast, this series is as easily consumed  as Chinese food from an upscale Chinese restaurant.  It looks interesting, tastes delicious during the meal - but, shortly after, you feel empty and wishing what was so yummy a little while before was still satisfying you.  But, it doesn't.Other standouts ... Una Stubbs and Mrs. Hudson and Louise Brealey as Mollie, the forensic lab tech who Holmes carelessly uses and mercilessly embarrasses.
B004WJRF6C|5.0|digitally re-mastered the first solo work from Paul after the break up. Written and recorded on a farm in Scotland with &#34;an unending supply of weed&#34; what's not to love?
B005DF2QMC|5.0|I am very pleased with this Casstte Tape converter. The trick is the software setup. If you can't setup audacity and MP3 conversion software please don't blame the product. I am half way converting my old tapes to MP3 and I am very happy with the DBTech product. It is working for me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this on my kindle fire thank you! Wish there were more King games available they're the best!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is good for hours of entertainment.  I recommend. it for anyone.  It is not as easy as you might think.  Since it is basically a free game try it and challenge yourself. Have some fun tickle his belly and see him laugh.  This game always makes me smile.
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|Trivium is one of the greatest metal bands in the past decade, in my opinion.  I'm not a huge fan of Crusade and I was a bit worried when I heard the singing:screaming ratio on this album was going to be closer to Crusade then their other albums.  To my surprise, nothing about this album was a disappointment.  The songs are much better written than the songs on Crusade and the high ratio of singing doesn't feel forced at all like they did to me on Crusade.  They are one of the few metal bands out there that can change it up on each album while still having the essential sound that fans love.  Ascendancy, Shogun, and In Waves are all instant classics and Vengeance Falls joins them in the ranks.
B00G725UZA|5.0|I waited up all night for this release, or maybe I should say I waited all year for the other shoe to fall.  There is no filler in this &#34;EP&#34;; in fact, it could stand alone as an album that overshadows its parent.  I'd rather have these 7 songs than a &#34;full&#34; album and it's infinitely worth the price to get the whole thing, even though I was initially only interested in the 10-minute version of &#34;Love is Lost&#34; that's the centerpiece-masterpiece.  I even prefer this version of &#34;I'd Rather Be High&#34; as well. As I mention in my review of &#34;God Bless The Girl&#34;, I listened to this album over and over for hours, and it's easily the best material he's made this century IMHO, if you weigh it as 7 straight classics in a single string. If you're a long-time fan, and you appreciate how much mental and spiritual stimulation the albums &#34;Ziggy Stardust&#34;, &#34;Aladdin Sane&#34;, &#34;Station To Station&#34;, &#34;Scary Monsters&#34; and &#34;Let's Dance&#34; held in their grooves, you'll fall in love with this &#34;EP&#34; like I did.  Make sure you listen uninterrupted for the all-important first impression and you'll see what I mean.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting patiently for this game to be available. Amazon you are the best.,Now I can play where and whenever I want because my Kindle Fire ,,stays on the go with me.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I reluctantly pre-ordered MMLP2 because I grew out of Eminem since his release of 'Relapse' it's a good thing he bounced back with 'Recovery.' Fitting Em back into my music schedule this last year has been a good thing, old school stuff like 'Just Don't Give a ****' and tracks Slim fans listen to when we need a way to vent and blow off steam. Even though I've drifted, I've been a junkie since I heard 'My Name Is' in 6th grade. I'm loving Rick Rubin's style. I've been a fan of his since he produced Johnny Cash's last 6 albums, and the best of his career.<br /><br />'Bad Guy' is almost perfect and a great start to the new album. It's genius. The meaning behind it is larger than the verses it contains. The reason I'm writing this review is the most powerful track, 'Headlights' which is an apology to his mother, Debbie. I gotta say I haven't had a lump in my throat while listening to rap since hearing 'When I'm Gone' for the first time. 'Headlights' is worth the $14.99 alone. It's closure on this whole thing for Eminem and his mom, and frankly his fans.<br /><br />True raw talent can be heard on 'Rap God' he spits it faster than any rapper out there. There's a reason he has sold more albums than any other rapper because he is the best. Props to him for staying sober the difference is unmistakable, his talent has peaked.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|This dictionary is obviously British.I've still found it very entertaining.I read all the articles after word of the day.its taken me to a myriad of links,I've gone on to read hours about subjects I never would have thought to look at.I play a couple of the word games.I think its improved my memory,vocabulary and provided hours of fun.plus read carefully,it doubles as a really good DICTIONARY.thanks for your time. Pete case
B009CVRQLY|5.0|This album is so refreshing to hear!  I love the new sound she's going for with this yet you still know it's Celine.....the incredible, amazing Celine!!  As a life-long fan of Celine, (and I'm only 30 now) this album has been a long time coming but so worth the wait!!<br /><br />From the title track to &#34;Somebody Loves Somebody&#34;, &#34;Water and a Flame&#34;, &#34;Didn't Know Love&#34;, and &#34;Incredible&#34; with NeYo, the album is chock-full of wonderful songs.  Even the songs she performs in Vegas have been tweaked a bit to fit with the album; and I'm glad they're not exactly the same.  If the song &#34;Incredible&#34; isn't picked up for the Olympics, much less released as a single, to quote NeYo in a recent interview, &#34;Somebody's not doing their job&#34;.  This album has so much potential and with it's fresh, modern sound it may even earn her some new  fans from the younger generation.  With so many young stars stripping down to almost nothing on national television or lip-synching their way through entire concerts it's great to see someone with her talent still able to conquer the way that she does.  And without running around half-naked.  This woman is an excellent role model in addition to her talent.<br /><br />On the vinyl version, the rap interlude on &#34;Save Your Soul&#34; is amazing.  I'm just sad it wasn't included on any other edition, especially as a bonus.  Both versions are great but the interlude just adds something to it.  I could hear this song all over the radios and, yes, even the clubs.  Overall, a truly special album with amazing material!!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|The book is interesting, but this is one case where the TV series is better.  The TV show has characters that are a lot more interesting and situations that are more dramatic (most of these don't even appear in the book.)
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John has had a dry season for a long time; Sycamore Row may have broken the drought in my opinion.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I highly recommend this one-just be sure to clear your schedule first as it is a real page-turner that you won't be able to put down until the last page.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love it.  Would really love it if I knew how to play. Where are the rules or hints? Maybe it's just me.
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|There are a couple of good songs, a lot of autopilot. Cliche'd lyrics. This will not go down as a memorable album.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I just bought this latest CD form CHER----so I now own most all her music! I prefer her dance music, but her ballads are great too.
1609611543|4.0|I bought this book because I thought it was the reason I lost significant weight following another well known diet. This book is recommended to those who have honestly tried other methods and been unsuccessful.  Personally, I went on a diet around 18 months ago because my weight was creeping up steadily without a change in my already very healthy diet, workout regime, or activity level.  I lost all the weight I needed to and from the usual trouble spots.  I am and have been extremely health conscious since my teen years.  I have tried all kinds of ways to tackle controlling my weight since then.  Eliminating the regular consumption of wheat, and insulin spiking foods from my diet made a major difference to my body shape and weight.  I believe wheat is a big part of the problem, because it is commonly used in convenience foods, both sweet and savory, and that is why it is emphasized in this book.  There are other foods that will do what wheat does but they are not the main go-to foods ie not eaten as often.  This is a lifestyle change commitment that was worthwhile for me, and it has helped me to almost effortlessly stay in shape.  It takes some getting used to and a strong will, and one can reap other benefits on the way!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An enjoyable &#34;Limited&#34; journey , as described by the author, into the after life. Eben Alexander III is also an exelent and easy reading writer. As my mother recienty &#34;passed&#34; after 11 months in pain, this book helped Me accept this transition.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|How many times can you watch this movie? Ask the grand kids they love it.<br />Enjoyable movie for the whole family.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is super addictive. I play it every day. Sometimes it has a lag. Also doesn't always turn when swiped. I like the daily and weekly challenges.  My grandson loves it too.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John did not disappoint. This story had me riveted to this kindle. I read it in two days and hated it to end. If you like John Grisham please add this to your collection.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The story bounces back and forth between Tris and Tobias' point of views but once you get the hang of that switching - it's a great story!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Got this within a weeks time.  This Sherlock Holmes is good, keeps you captivated and wondering what is next.  I would Highly reccomend
B0084TWN9K|5.0|These stories are wonderful slices of life.  Each has stayed with me.  it seems almost as though they are my own experiences.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This is the only way to get great movies and a wonderful jaw dropping price.  I have a wishlist now of all the movies I'm going to purchase.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I enjoyed this.  For me this book was a good reminder and I would recommend it especially to young people.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Getting movies here is the best thing, in fact I have a list I'm creating in my &#34;wish list&#34;.  Because I'm only purchasing this way.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I used this app mainly to control my computer in Texas when I was visiting my mom in Florida. It worked surprisingly well despite her 1 Mbps connection. I was able to browse the web and even initiate some downloads on my computer.<br /><br />I also tried it using a Verizon hotspot with 3G service and it still worked well, although the response delay was more noticeable. So it is safe to say that it does handle compression well enough to stream to slower connections.<br /><br />I can't guarantee it will work for all connections or all situations, but it worked very well for me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is the best game ever. it is so addicting.some of the levels are easy tjen it gets hard. my whole family plays because its so much fun!!!!!!!!
B00000DFTG|5.0|True live metal. The true masters of metal put on a stunning show. Black Sabbath at there very very best.
B00867HDTA|5.0|If there is one bad thing I can say about Flick Soccer it would have to be that it is too addicting! I have got three of my friends hook and find myself keeping busy anytime I am stuck waiting on anything. I got this app free through Amazons free app of the day app. Try it out if your not worried about becoming a Flick Soccer Zombie!
B002GHHHKG|5.0|Great movie, love the story and the actors. One of my all time favorites. The soundtrack is also very good I have that as well...
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Google Chromecast works great. Excellent price. Easy setup. Now only thing is I hope that google plans to add more to it as it has the platform to be so much more. One thing to consider is Amazon is believed to be developing something similar so I would suggest waiting and comparing the 2.
B00G4SS24I|2.0|I must say Sky delivered an eclectic and sometimes uneven tracks on night time,my time and overall the record delivers some hidden gems but mostly has more duds. as a fan i'm more disappointed and would like to see more growth as an artist.
B000V4NX04|4.0|It's obvious from the beginning that this hard working captain of the East German secret police doesn't quite have the same ruthlessness and selfishness that his superiors have.  He excelled at the job because he once believed in the ideals of socialism and not for personal gain or power.  This film shows his agonizingly slow sympathy with the artistic community and disgust with the hypocrisy, ambition, and cruelty of the party elite.  The lead actor is perfectly cast because his eyes express what would be impossible for this character's dialogue and actions to do.  Orwell would be proud.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|Avril new album is a quality record with great tracks and beats especially with husband chad kroeger and marilyn manson. I must say she grown since when she hit the music scene back in early 2000 and continues to blossom into an expectational musical performer.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|I CAN HONESTLY SAY THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SONG ON THIS ALBUM THAT I DID NOT LIKE.<br />EVERY SONG IS FANTASTIC. MUSICALLY AND VOCALLY, AVRIL DELIVERS FLAWLESSLY!<br />HER BEST WORK YET.<br /><br />BUY THIS ALBUM NOW. RARELY DOES AN ARTIST PUT OUT AN ALBUM WHERE EVERY SONG IS A HIT.<br />THIS IS ONE OF THOSE EXCEPTIONAL ALBUMS.<br /><br />SHE COMES BACK BETTER THAN EVER WITH THIS SELF TITLED WORK OF ART.<br /><br />ENJOY IT!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It forces me to update and after I do I can't even open in anymore. When something works as is, leave it alone.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|This CD is my absolute favorite - every song is spot on. Mark Knopfler is an amazing artist and in my opinion, a total genius!
B00E9ZATJO|3.0|This movie was pretty funny. I actually liked it better than the first Monsters movie. I love the nerdy characters that Mike and Sully end up working with.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Mark Knopfler is a genius and every song on every CD I have ordered is wonderful. I love his sound, his moods, his musical genius!
B009NPA3MS|5.0|We cannot get enough of Phil Phillips!  Great voice, great music!  We're old empty nesters, but we love the vibrancy and enthusiasm of Phil's music.  In addition to this CD, we also have downloaded all of his iTune tracks from the TV show.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I like the two of them together - each bringing their brilliance to the songs they sing and on which they collaborate.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book reminded me of why, as a child, I loved Science Fiction, Great ideas, Great adventure and  Great imagination.<br />I am old now, and having started reading adult novels at age 9, most stories are unoriginal and cliched at this time of my life.  I<br />Am always looking for interesting books that  can transport me to new places where I can lose myself for a few hours.  Ender's game did that for me and I am very grateful to Mr. Card for the experience.  Added bonus was finding that I can discuss the book with my son, who read it while serving in the Marine Corps, as it was on the Commandant's reading list.  I believe that anyone would enjoy reading this book, whether old or young, male or female.  ( I am a Grandma)<br />  It does deal with training children for military duty, but the training is fascinating, and the human emotion is portrayed realistically.  The story is absolutely a page-turner and I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My favorite Jack Reacher book and I've just about read them all. I love the Jack Reacher series, cant wait to read the next one!
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I love the voice of the lady who never gave up.  This is traditional Christmas album, very relaxing, one that could be played for gatherings during the holidays or when you are on your own.<br />Susan is the best.  I'm giving this as a Christmas gift to my friends.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I've just begun the game. It's interesting so far. Confusing at first but I think I'll like it as I get further into the rooms  Great graphics. But I wish it would let me zoom in.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|This table is a blast to run. I love pinball and the new digital pinball makes it easier to deal with the fact that it is nearly impossible to find a pinball table let alone a good one. My local laundry mat has ..... wait for it.... Wheel of Fofrtune. Not raven worth the 50 cents they want to play it. Digital pinball rules ans so does this table. See also their Star Wars table it's one o my faves. Buy this table and all others made by this same developer. You won't be unhappy.<br /><br />Kristen Spangenburg
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was interesting enough to keep me reading till the end.  Wanted a little something more can't explaing what. Just a feeling of wanting more from the story.
B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|McQueen was an art student before he became a filmmaker and while watching this film you can detect the influence of Brueghel and Goya (esp in the hanging sequence which is the most visually arresting of the entire film). And you can also detect the art school influence in the way he films groups of slaves standing still and looking straight into camera as if standing for a portrait. These moments are arresting and draw attention to the film as art object but also foreground the way faces in paintings seem to be looking at us, asking for compassion, asking not to be forgotten. But those art film flourishes aside this is not an art film, but in many ways an Old Hollywood drama with loads of Oscar appeal for three reasons. 1) McQueen is known for long takes and in this film the camera lingers on what it shows far longer than any other filmmaker has lingered on images of slavery especially of prolonged scenes of torture including lashings and rape. 2) McQueen digs much deeper into the psychologies of both the slaves and slavemasters than any previous filmmaker. Fassbender's performance is especially memorable. The role illustrates the depths of depravity (and soul-twisting rationalizations) required to participate in such a vile practice. His Edwin Epps is a man who cannot feel like a man unless he dominates others but the more he dominates (or tries to) the less of a man he becomes. Its a fascinating role and performance. Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance is equally memorable but in a completely different way. Fassbender's performance is manic and over the top and Ejiofor's is subdued, understated because that is the only way his Solomon Northup can survive his 12 year long ordeal. 3)  McQueen provides us with glimpes of a wide array of strategies employed by both slaves to endure and slave masters to justify this practice, this inhumane chapter in history. The most moving moment of the film is the moment the slaves all join together to sing &#34;Roll Jordan Roll&#34; while standing in a graveyard. In this moment they are no longer individuals (no individual can bear the burden they have been forced to bear alone) but a collective all leaning on each other and on God to see them through and to temporarily transform their pain and suffering into something beautiful, something life-affirming and soul-sustaining. But we also see other kinds of slaves who endured in other ways. One of the most memorable of these is played by Alfre Woodard who portrays a slave who uses her feminine wiles to become the wife of a slavemaster. Its a small role, just a few minutes of screen time, but its a few moments that remain etched in memory----this women has survived and will continue to survive only so long as she can veil her true self. And this performance is juxtaposed with Lupito Nyongo's even more memorable and movong performance as &#34;Patsey,&#34; a slave who cannot and will not veil her true self for anyone. Equally important (although less emotionally impactful) McQueen shows us that not all of the slaveowners were vile creatures like Epps but how even otherwise decent men owned slaves and justified this practice to themselves (at least one of the actors is quoted as saying he found these types to be even more vile than Epps because they knew better). Benedict Cumberbatch's &#34;Ford&#34; is one of these otherwise decent men who knew better but nonetheless did nothing to stop this horrific practice. And he is balanced by a decent man played by Brad Pitt who did do something about it.ile standing in a graveyard.

1451666179|5.0|This is one of those books that just makes you laugh and feel sad at different times. Allie can make you understand and relate the things she endured as a child and adult, whether its depression, fear, anxiety or identities mishap to even loving a mentally special dog. Definitely a must read!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Its  a pretty good app. I really enjoyed it because the kindle fire hd does not come with a camcorder.
1250038820|5.0|I am a psychologist and I will have this book in my waiting room.<br /><br />Brandon is a superhero. Bringing human connections to the masses is not easy. He makes it look so easy though!<br /><br />I absolutely love this book and await the second one !
B000002IAZ|2.0|I WAS NEVER A BIG FAN OF BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD EVEN IN IT'S HAYDAY SO THIS CD JUST REMINDED ME WHY.  I BOUGHT IT JUST TO HAVE A VARIETY OF MUSIC.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved it - great story... Impressive, surprising and thrilling. Not much else to say! Keep them coming mr Grisham ...
0792844793|4.0|IT STARTS OUT PRETTY SLOW.  AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TURN IT OFF BUT DECIDED TO STICK IT OUT.  IT TURNED OUT TO BE A REALLY INTENSE MOVIE.  I LIKE IT.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|nice execution of the lego/minecraft connection.  this seemed obvious to me and my daughter when we started playing minecraft.  only bad thing, the box came damaged -
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I have read three of crouch books and they are all weird. This one is too.  But it keeps your interest from page one. I won't tell u what happens, but suffice it to say it's way out there. Give it a try.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|great, high quality toy.  my 2 year old son loves this garage.  will work with hot wheels and pixar cars, but the plan toys cars are my sons favorites - recommend you get a few more of those to go along with this garage.  only downside and I didnt ding them for it is the cost - very expensive, but it's a high quality toy that stands up to lots of abuse.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and glued down the ramps - great idea.  I also used wood glue on all the screws when I put it together.  this thing is a tank!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not super difficult.  Satisfying to figure out each room.  I am looking forward to rooms 11 through 15.  Worth the download!
B00G32OER4|5.0|Well produced thriller with great actors playing the roles. It reminds me of the old time horror movies that relied less on special effects and more on the story and characters involved. This movie was based on a real event claimed by Lorraine Warren an east coast psychic medium.  I don't know how true this was to the actual event, but I was engrossed throughout the entire film.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I've seen it several times and I love the chemistry.  I know that people don't like the Star Trek 2 twist, but I thought it was well done.  I like the fact that they've updated the franchise with an edgier feel - doesn't mean I like the classic any less!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I've been a fan of Eminem for a long time. Since the Infinite album. My friend is just as big of an Eminem fan as I am, but I asked for what he thought about this album, and he said it was decent. It wasn't his best, but it was good. I don't know if it's just me, but I loved it! 10/10. Out of the 21 songs, I loved 19 of them, 1 was decent, and 1 I couldn't stand. Overall, I really enjoyed this album. This and Born Sinner (J. Cole) are my favorite albums this year.<br /><br />I need to mention this. The song he did with Kendrick Llamar...Love Game. That was the first time Eminem was on a track with somebody and didn't destroy them. I loved Kendrick's verse! I was shocked by that. I didn't think he could rap to the tempo of that song.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about the album is that it had...maybe 4 songs that have a Rock feel to it. Berzerk, So Far...I forget the other songs, but they have a Rock feel to them. It was risky and different, but I liked it.<br /><br />So yeah. I loved the album as much as I thought I would.
B00992CF6W|3.0|like it but computer version and x box is better plus there Is only 4 kinds of monsters<br />And there is not much to craft
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is a totally different twist on a very great classic. All the characters are very likeable. And as with the original leaves you with a good feeling.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|This was my second time to read it.  I watched the movie with Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman and had to read the book again.  Of course, the book is better than the movie.  Great read - love Hemingway books.
B00A86AIAI|5.0|This is a great looking statue!  It has very sleek color and detail. There is no articulation since it is a statue, not a figure. The magnet base is effective, but not very strong. It won't fall over on its own, but it won't take much of a bump to be knocked over. As much as I hate to say it, Amazon is the best place to buy as most retailers are selling for $50. I was unsure of this for a while, but now I'm glad I bought it.
B002M87W2W|3.0|watched with middle school aged kids. Was entertaining enough, but wasn't a smash hit. It came highly recommended for families, must be because three girls in the story. It disappointed a little, but nothing offensive in it. Somehow it was hard to get really invested in the outcome. Pleasant.
1419705644|5.0|A few people have claimed that this book doesn't have new information on the adventure time universe, but I respectfully disagree. I found a good deal of new and novel information between these covers.<br />And for those that claim the author knows nothing of adventure time...Please review the adventure time cast list and the author of the book again...
B000MKD9P6|4.0|This movie is fun. Emily Blunt (in her breakout role) is great. Women and girls will especially enjoy the fashion aspects, the fashion week bits in Paris, the whole concept. Like a grown-up's Princess Diaries.
0375714839|5.0|It's a good read. I hope this book is making it's way into schools. It gives a good sense of history without being preachy. It is a story that I think would benefit many teens to read. The art is very in touch with the story as well.
B0014DQSG2|4.0|Great movie for kids. hard to find appropriate content for girls, this one, though predicable for the most part, delivers what it is suppose to deliver- fun, light entertainment. Rags to riches story in a way- what's not to like for a chill afternoon or evening? Good sleepover or friends over movie.
0062059882|5.0|This is my favorite book. It was written by my favorite author. If it were up to me this book would be required reading for High School students.<br />It paints a world that is so much like our own that you will find yourself walking down those strange streets in your home town searching for the magic you might have missed growing up.<br />This is the only book that I have found myself re-reading over and over because every time I fall in love again.<br />It is so easy to fall into cliches when trying to recommend books to people, but you really do owe it to yourself to read this book. At worst you don't like it, but if you are anything like me it will give you an appreciation for the magic in the world around you.
0316219266|5.0|i liked the audible version. had a long drive from SC to CT and the book was just wrapping up as i pulled into the driveway. im aldo a tech entrepreneur about the same age as JB. Stone recalled the history of those years admirably. prrhaps gave Bezos too much credit for his technical abilities. ive never been overly impressed w amazon on that front-until very recently w AWS.
0441017177|5.0|I am more of a fantasy buff rather than a Sci-Fi buff, but I really enjoy House of Suns. It takes a novel approach to slower than light space travel (Novel to me at least) and the idea of cloning and the passage of time.<br />I would recommend this book to most anyone. It left me wanting more in the best way!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This is the first time I have ever written a book review but I have never been so dissapointed with the final installment of a trilogy.  I loved the first two books and I wish I had stopped after reading The Insurgent and just drawn my own conclusions.  The Allegiant seems like the author just borrowed ideas from a bunch of different books and movies (Hunger Games, Truman Show, etc).  It is fairly unoriginal, often very confusing, and overall disappointing.
1594202273|4.0|looks good, haven't read it yet.  I have read many things about command and control in the US and other nations, this looks to have new information.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|nice. addicting game folks. fun to be able to upgrade guns. so far no provender on kindle fire. way to go.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This was an extremely awesome movie for any music nut.  I would recommend it for anybody who is interested in the history of music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting!  You can't stop. However you do have to stop for a few minutes when it locks you out!  Fun Fun Fun
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|In my opinion this is Korn's best work, they get better with each release. Considering that I love all their work, that is saying a lot. Korn is always exploring new realms of sound and subject. Check this one out, you will not be disappointed!
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Ugh. Will Smith tried, but this movie blows. Bad direction, faulty dialog, typical script. Acting was acceptable.Seemed pandering--like it was an excuse to get Jayden in a movie, which is sad, I think he could do well in a better movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of those rare occurrences in which the hype is justified. While I’m not a regular reader of novels in the suspense/thriller genre, I decided to give this one a try after hearing about the mind-bending plot twist, and wanting to be in the know before the film version is released next year.<br /><br />And ‘Gone Girl’ surpassed my expectations. Gillian Flynn’s prose is easy-to-read yet smart and witty. In the beginning, I thought the chapters corresponding to Amy’s PoV were a little pretentious and clunky. Thankfully, you realize midway through the novel that this was done on purpose (no spoilers).<br /><br />I know a lot of people were upset with the ending but I thought it was perfect. I read that Gillian Flynn was influenced by “Rosemary’s Baby” in the writing of this novel and this is most evident in the ambivalent ending, which like real life, shows that one may never really rid themselves of our lives’ demons.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I have been reading science fiction for a long time. Even though the story has some  reused concepts, I found this to be very novel and refreshing.  So much so that I download the next three books in the series.  This is the first book I have read by John Scalzi and I am sure that it will not be the last.
B005C4ERHQ|4.0|In a rating of 1 - 10, I would rate 7.  I am satisfied with this book and would recommend to others.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This was such a GREAT movie.  I bought it because my Mother recommended it.<br />We watched it and, WOW, it was good.  You will love this movie, unless you are a troglodyte.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|A very useful app. A time and effort saving, a clean writing style, an orthographic consistency... a good help to serious writing with lesser stress, especially with the small screen of my phone .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun game. Myself, my kids and husband love playing this game. It kills time so fast just wish some of the things were free. Great game
0679745203|5.0|Extraordinary writer. A compelling cast of characters and stories somehow woven into one narrative. Time and place explored with a deft hand.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I was at level 62 and the app won't. open.  I loved the game but because the app wont open I lost it all
B0091REZMW|4.0|I do like the game but i wish the energy would regenerate faster. Its still a fun game though. Enjoy!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Disappointed that it only works with Netflix and YouTube. Expected it to work with Amazon Prime. Hopefully it will be less limited in the future. Works OK with Netflix.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book so much. I can't wait for the the movie to come out this year. So excited!
1401207529|5.0|Not quite on par with The Long Halloween or The Dark Knight Returns, but almost. So many years of continuity pulled from this series.
B000FC1PNE|3.0|It kinda lacked chemistry & thrill that JQ has in her other books. The story is good but it did rather take Colin several years to realize his love.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very interesting, I felt anger at times, I had a hard time putting the book down in anticipation of learning why Christian did the things he did.  The book definitely keeps you interested.  I have to see what happens next
0062073192|5.0|Oh my God, I haven't read it all yet, but I just have to say: after watching all of Supernatural and then reading this I have to hold back my tears as I can picture a happy Dean slowly getting less and less happy from John's PoV.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I reread Divergent and Insurgent before I read Allegiant. I have been thinking about this book and the many problems that were in it ever since I finished it.  I was excited to see where the story was going to take us after the end of Insurgent and after finishing Allegiant I was confused and disappointed.  The book has so many problems with the storyline and the characters felt like they had actually de-evolved instead of growing.  And don't even get me started on the genetically pure and damaged garbage.  Yes, I know that it is Veronica Roth's story, but when you published something and charge money for it, you owe your readers a good story. I had a problem with the way that the many deaths were handled....I was not emotionally invested in the characters like I had been in the previous books.  It was like a different author wrote Allegiant.  I have never finished a book and felt empty and betrayed like I did after finishing this book.  I didn't even know what to read next.  I was even afraid to read a book that I hadn't read before.  Thankfully, I have the Harry Potter books on my kindle and I was able to immerse myself in that world ( I started Deadly Hallows last night).  I reread my favorite books and I doubt that I will ever reread the Divergent trilogy.....I almost returned Allegiant for a refund.  And I probably will never buy a book by Veronica Roth again.
B000W3Q1HG|5.0|Words to live life by.  This is one of the first books that I read when I started on my path of growth years ago.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Since I always have my Kindle with me I never have too look for a calculator. BIG numbers are easy to punch,and it always has the info you've entered so you can't lose you place.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|The most beautiful Christmas album I have ever heard!  I loved every tract on this album, and I keep playing it over and over.  They say that Susan Boyle has the voice of an angel and this album will make you believe it.  Her voice has a sweetness and pure clarity that is unique to Ms Boyle.  She is one of the most talented artists of our generation.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|This is an epic and awesome piece of work!  The History Channel has outdone itself with this series.  Travis Fimmel makes an excellent Ragnar.  Everyone looks authentic: dirty, hairy, and (at times) bloody.  The acting is perfect and you can't stop watching this show.  I cannot wait for season two.  Unlike the shows you find on HBO, you can actually watch this program and feel like you've learned something.  Epic?  Yes.  Great cinematography?  Check.  Go buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have been reading quite of few books like these, all the ones that everyone seems to recommend, but none are as fun to read as this one! I love the way Pam writes and how she frames everything. It's also nice to read a book where Jesus' name isn't kept out of the book. I can't stop recommending this book to my friends.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|I really enjoyed Katy Perry's latest album.  This really raises the bar for other pop artists.  Her lyrics have taken a more serious turn (with the exception of &#34;Birthday&#34;-which is possibly the cheesiest song on the disc, very much like 'California Girls').  The instrumentation is well mixed and her vocals soar, or should I say Roar?  Awesome music, don't miss it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The unit works as described, setup is not difficult, i wish it support the display up to 1080P, however, it supports only 720P
B008NEVP1S|4.0|Very good album. You can go to youtube to listen to much (but not all) of it -- Aimee Mann's management has put up about 10 songs on her channel. They are also selling a classic, orange-colored LP that is shown on the youtube tracks. Very pretty. I'd buy that as a collectible. Aimee Mann puts a lot into her artwork (she's won a Grammy for it) so even this DVD features excellent artwork which makes it worth buying and holding.<br /><br />The songs on this album are classic Aimee Mann. Smart lyrics and melodies that grow on you and her voice can turn any song into a great song. The songs grow on you. This is not her best album (Lost in Space is that for me) but this is very, very good.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Great stories, authentic sets, well acted, engaging....got hooked on series 1, watched series 2 and  3.  Working through the rest.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A creative story that allows the mind to create detailed images with child like wonder and adult appreciation for literature. A wonderful read!
B00FKAA3MA|3.0|old school vibe is sprinkled through here. my fave cut on here is the duet with Kendrick Lamar &#34;Love Game&#34;. personally they could have done a whole project together  and it would have worked.  problem with EM for me is his screaming  and generic beats on certain tracks.he also  hit his artistic prime  and peak. 99/02. he been on cruise  control  for a decade, this album has a few moments.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|I love Jack Johnson and was excited for this CD to come out.  This one did not disappoint, great music! :)
B005USZYDU|3.0|God book but bad ending<br />Story is not finished<br />The overall story was repetitive and boring.<br />I am 12 and this is my review for other teenagers
1594746036|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was a great one to read in October, it was spooky in a good way and different than anything I've read.
0385349947|5.0|Wow. So much more than just a feminist business book; Lean In is about actively striving for gender equality that truly benefits everyone. I would encourage all men and women of all ages, titles and professions to read it (in fact, if I were a CEO, or a manager of a large team, I would give a copy to each of my employees). There are no chips on shoulders, or bitter accusations; just honest, down to earth and tangible advice for a better world, which, after finishing this book, looks to me very much like it starts with gender equality - at home and at work. It sounds cliché on the surface, but it's not. Just read it, and you'll see.
B00DUHT3OO|5.0|great book. a classic. I want to see the movie. It is romance incarnate. I will purchase the movie next.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that Candy Crush is on Kindle, now we need Pet Saga, yeah, then my life would be complete. lol
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I very much enjoyed how the book was written. A real coming of age story I wish I read in high school. Still a great book nonetheless
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|Dream theater's latest is far from their best album but its not a bad listen at all.<br /><br />As for the product: great packaging and delivered in perfect conditions as always.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad candy crush was added to amazon. good way to pass time and beat your friends at a fun game
B0063IH60K|5.0|There are so many options that it is easy to find your favorite way of playing solitaire.  Fluid game play.  I have been playing this app for a year on my Kindle Fire and haven't tired of it yet.
B0075NM8N2|3.0|it wasnt as good as i thought it would be. my daughter loved it. i dont like all of stephen king. for me this book was an ok read.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this book when it first come out years ago .Had to read again before Doctor Sleep.You won't be disappointed if you've never read it. Give it a try as the book is so much different than the movie.If you go by the movie you won't get Doctor Sleep.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love playing this. It is very addicting.. :)<br /><br />My daughter's also enjoy trying to beat each other for the highest level.
B001C08RHA|3.0|It said it was in excellent condition and it was not. The dvd wont even play in certain dvd players.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Fun unroll you can't move forward because you have to buy more lives  for 99 cents. Or wait to try again. How silly. Waste of time. Is this the same game everyone is talking about or a knock off? I'm confused.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The writing style is very simple and lacks in detail sometimes, but the story line is very good. Definitely worth the read as you can finish the trilogy in a few days and get a really good, emotional story.
B006LSZECO|4.0|really keeps you  hooked as you want to find out what happened and who is actually to blame for the breakdown of this relationship.
B00CUHMUZ4|5.0|Nice disk unfortunately track error on 1 selection making it unplayable after that selection (Bad copy).  Found this out<br />after 1 month (item was a gift).  As such Amazon will not refund/replace.  Buyer beware.  This is not first time I have<br />have bad copy DVD but first from Andre Rieu.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|Very cute!  Will read over and over.<br />Also, I love the artwork and that this book s great for cat lovers of all ages.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|This game crashes on average either once every 3x it's opened or once every 5 min, not kidding, wish I was!
B000A6EXNO|4.0|Fits my D800 camera perfectly and works well.  Nikon should include this accessory with all new cameras.  Really a big improvement over the stock eyecup: if you can even call the stock piece an &#34;eyecup&#34;?  Only complaint, Nikon expects you to take apart the stock eyecup into 3 pieces and reuse two of these pieces snapping them into the new eyepiece.  A hassle, and oddity.  Maybe saved them a few pennies.  But after assembly it fits perfectly and works well.  My D800 is prone to picking up extraneous light through the viewfinder and this really eliminates that all together.
0307744434|2.0|It was a tedious read. Within the first 10 pages or so I could figure out where the book was heading and how it was going to end.  The mid section dragged and sagged. Even though the entire concept of the novel was imaginative, it simply was not captivating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son and I love this game!! We play daily and love switching out the costumes. Glad it's available on the Kindle. Good job!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. Very entertaining. Hard to put down when I really should be getting some sleep. Loved it a LOT.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Lots of fun. I've always enjoyed jug saw puzzles and it's nice not to have a table covered with a puzzle.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I would love to give this game a great review but am unable to do so. I downloaded the game before going on vacation to have something to do on the plane. after waiting all day for it to download I started playing and loving it. but then is started locking up and freezing taking forever to catch up. I was able to complete the first chapter only for the game to lock up. I had to reset the game before it would load again causing me to start from the beginning to only have it not load at all now!!!! The game seems very buggy pleasssssssse fix. I would love to play this game!!!!!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Always like 007 action packed movies...has romance, action, and drama. Would watch it again . What more can I say.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This is a great book that kept my interest all the way through.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves history and the discovery of unsolved mysteries.  Kate Morton is masterful at weaving her way through the past to reveal what really happened.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|I loved this book. The twists and turns of the plot and the really insightful writing kept me reading well into the wee small hours. A disappearance, a murder, the hunt for gold in 19th century New Zealand and some really memorable characters telling their different versions of events drive the narrative along at a great pace. The plot is like a huge jigsaw puzzle that finally comes together.This one is definitely a winner. Looking forward to more of the same from this author.
B00377V6J2|5.0|I bought this for my husband who is a big fan of Stevie Ray Vaughan and he told me that he loved this CD/DVD combo.  He liked this CD/DVD, not just for the musical content but also for the story telling interaction between Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King. It was interesting, from a Historical prospective to hear how Stevie Ray learned to play the Blues live on stage from Albert King. Overall he said that this was a great CD/DVD set to have.
B00B7807PM|4.0|I watched Season 3 of Downton Abbey with many and varied emotions, as usual.  I still love the acting, the writing, and the progression of the characters as well as the story line!  I am now anxiously awaiting Season 4, along with the better part of almost 12,000 of my fellow reviewers, and have begun a campaign to get my husband to watch this series... preferably from Season 1 so that I can watch it all over again, myself!<br /><br />Of course, there were a few things that I didn't like.  I may be in the minority regarding this, but I did not like Shirley MacLaine as Cora's mother.  I thought that her performance was mostly forced and dry, although it was well-written in the fact that Martha Levinson was intended to be Violet's opposite yet equal force.  I felt that Ms MacLaine was only moderately successful in the role, but that's just my opinion.<br /><br />I also felt that the Bates story line was a bit overdone, and was glad when it came to a conclusion.  The season's ending, of course, was a stunner, but I'm not believing anything until I see it in a coffin.  (That's my ostrich impression for the day.)  Mrs. Hughes and her health condition was riveting; I felt for her every step of the way. I did not too much like the flighty-cousin (Rose) story line, but I did like her kindness to Anna, and the fact that she obviously has some kind of drama coming around the bend.<br /><br />I still recommend this series; I do love to watch it, and can't wait to see what happens!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Couldn't put it down or get back to it fast enough when I did put it down!  Haven't read one by Mr Baldacci that wasn't awesome.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Uplifting movie, quality cast, easily delivered to our TV...a great entertainment experience. Namaste to solid home entertainment at the push of a button!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed each book in this series but this one was by far the best. Ms. Collins did a magnificent job in portraying the horrors of war and the aftermath these atrocities can cause. The character development was superb and the ending was fitting and definitely went with the rest of the story. Some series seem to lose their way by book 3 but Mockingjay stayed true.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Fun in the beginning, but gets old quick. Kind of a silly application even for free. Needs to be able to do more.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Great Movie!! I am 60 and have been watching Star Trek shows and movies since High School and have never been disappointed!
B0063M22QO|5.0|The colors are bright and the tiles easy to read.  I love mahjong and this version keeps you engaged by various layouts.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|They had the choice to make this like the book or not and chose not to. Poor choice. A shame because the movie was well done as it was just with a crappy adaptation of the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|How could not stop playing this game I've had it for 2 day's and I went to all the places!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it wakes me up it tells when to go to bed its amazing and it keeps me awake.yay its amazing
B000000ZGO|5.0|Bought this for my dad as a gift and he absolutely loved it. I didn't listen to any music of the music so I can't directly comment on it.
0545586178|5.0|the book was in great condition. And the story was excellent. Thank you very much as usual I was not disappointed.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie about independent thought and rising against oppression.  This is a great movie for all ages!!! Go see today
B009NY43NY|1.0|So disappointed, I've followed her Dead series for years, and the wrap up was terrible! Should of waited to purchase after reading the reviews, versus pre ordering the book.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A real story about real airmen with a true sense of morality.  Didn't want the story to end.  Used Kindle format on my PC.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Simply wonderful. Never disappointed with Katy. Can't wait to listen to this a million times over and never get tired of it. Nuff said
1439181780|5.0|I purchased the secret a few years back and it changed my whole life. I was in a very bad place in life and received the secret from someone and I read it wow. I have giving these books  to people having  trouble in life and they loved it And now the POWER is amazing with in the first few pages life has gotten even better<br /><br />GOD BLESS RHONDA BYRNE
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book! It is so amazing and I DEFINETLY reccomend reading it! SO PLEASE READ THIS BOOK! I lOve it so much
B00ESJICMC|5.0|Yet another remarkable release from one very talented singer/songwriter!  This is Blunt's best release to date, expanding an already outstanding catalogue.  There's not a single miss on this one...every track is a wonderful gem!  This is a very well produced package of incredibly beautiful songs.  Truly awesome....enjoy!
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|This movie is like a ride at the park, a total BLAST!! Great fun for the whole family.<br />Just sit back and enjoy. Great special affects, good story and just plain cool!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I loved this book & am so happy there was a book 2. I am looking forward to book 3 next year. You can't put these books down!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|To say this book is different is definitely true.  This was my first Neil Gaiman read and it would have been perfect for Halloween.  The story is entertaining, but it takes getting into the story to really decide what it's about.  It's simply fantasy, yet it does grab your attention and makes the reader wonder what's going to happen next.  And this is what makes it interesting.  I couldn't give it a 4 or 5, but it was a solid 3 for me.  Good, but not close to great.
1451666179|5.0|I got this book two days ago and have read it three times since.  So funny and dead-on.  Buying it for all my friends.
B00004SAAX|5.0|I have never enjoyed Bach as much as I do in this twelve-CD masterpiece. I listen to it over and over again. At the risk of offending traditional classical music enthusiasts, this version of Back really rocks! I don't mean that the music is adapted in any way to the rock-and-roll age. Walcha was a traditionalist. But Walcha plays Bach loud and strong through that classical pipe organ. He does not try to soften the edges to make it more palatable to modern genteel classical listeners. I have found that, as a result, this rendering of Bach organ music appeals even to twenty-somethings raised on pop and rock, no doubt in part because of the powerful bass organ notes that practically rattle the floor and vibrate through your soul.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|It gives some of the same hints and tips but so far it has not helped me to advance on the more difficult levels
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hated the ending.  Will be interesting to see what Season 4 brings now, if they ever do Season 4.  Good acting.
B0042816YK|5.0|This is one of my favorite m movies, I bought one got myself and for a friend. The price was great and service was excellent ..thank you.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Thank you for such an awesome trilogy. This is in my top five authors. The ending was magnificently written. I can't wait to see more books written by you.
1250030951|5.0|Oh, Fangirl. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.<br /><br />1) I love Fangirl for the protagonist. Cather is smart, shy, responsible, serious, talented, and a joy to read. She wins you over within the first few chapters, and (in a literary development as necessary as it is rare), she never loses you. Her flaws, strengths, and interests flow naturally together instead of feeling as if they were thrown in willy-nilly by an author seeking to create an 'original' 'quirky' character. And she never weaves in and out of character like most fictional protagonists, bounding merrily from 'Angsty Girl' to 'Funny Girl' to 'Strong, Empowered Girl.' Cath is who she is, and she stays that way, and it makes the story so much more believable.<br /><br />2) I love Fangirl for the protagonist's hobby. While I've never read or written fanfiction, I do write plain old fiction. And I can never help loving a protagonist who writes fiction. Considering the fact that all fictional protagonists are created by fiction writers, it's a strangely rare interest for those characters to have. Cath's struggles with writer's block are relatable and true to life, and her devotion to her story echoes my own feelings.<br /><br />3) I love Fangirl for the romance. Normally, this is the part of a young adult book that makes me lose enthusiasm for the story. Such an overwhelming number of good books are ruined by shallow, unrealistic, appearance-based, chemistry-devoid insta-romances, it can make a grown YA lover cry. Fangirl, however, succeeded in doing two of the most difficult things a book can do: making the love interest a surprise, and making the reader fall in love with him as surely as the protagonist does. I became a fangirl myself for this relationship; I squealed, I sighed, I shivered, I swooned, I wanted to reach into the book and drag the guy out into reality. It was a relatively new experience for me, and a heady one, and it worked because the author made it a realistic love. Huge kudos to Rainbow Rowell for proving, once again, that a trust-based love between two likeable, reasonably flawed, normal-looking characters will always have more emotional impact than steamy looks and sizzling kisses between a featureless protagonist and a red-hot surly bad boy. Normal is not boring, normal is real, and what could be more exciting than reality?<br /><br />4) I love Fangirl for Cather's family. Her absentee mother, wild-child sister, and 'mad scientist' father are all presented as whole, believable people. There are no caricatures here; these are real people with real motivations and inner demons, and that makes their pain and triumphs vastly satisfying.<br /><br />5) I love Fangirl for the setting. In a genre glutted with high schoolers, it's refreshing to meet a cast from a different stage of life for once.<br /><br />In sum: this is one of the best, most memorable books I've read all year. Deft characterization, heart-fluttering romance, artistic struggles, and a quirky, rock-solid protagonist add up to a winning, satisfying read. Deny yourself Fangirl, and you will be denying yourself not just a book, but an experience.s to Rainbow Rowell for proving, once again, that a trust-based love between two likeable, reasonably flawed, normal-looking characters will always have more emotional impact than steamy looks and sizzling kisses between a featureless protagonist and a red-hot surly bad boy.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is worth the money! It is one of my all time favorite shows!! The drama is very very very very very good!
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Love my Walking Dead toys!!!! Finally I get my Daryl toy figure....At a great price too... loving it...need to add more figures...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A perfect next chapter to &#34;The Shining&#34;. I couldn't put it down. I will never look at a RV campground the same.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|I loved everything about this complex, twisting, riveting series.  No sooner do I finish one book than I can't wait to start the next one.  Thank you George Martin for one of the best stories I've ever read.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|I am a big fan of their albums &#34;funeral&#34; and &#34;The suburbs&#34;. In this new album they mixed up with a lot of disco beat and they were trying to make more complex and more detailing music, when you listening to this ablum again and again, you will never feel boring.<br />definitely one of the best albums this year!
B00699XMCO|4.0|Arnold Lobel writes great stories, this is no exception.  Owl is a naive character and walks us through his humorous adventures.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful love story but get your tissues ready.  Hard to put the book down, especially the last half.  You'll love Hazel and Gus.
0061537969|5.0|My husband has wanted to read this book for several years.  He got really caught up in the compassion and throughly enjoyed it.  He gave me the book to read with a box of kleenex. (Oh Dear)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is captivating from the very first chapter. I have recommended it to numerous friends and all of them loved it too. I am getting ready to reread it for a third time.
B000FA675C|5.0|Angel and demons is better but this book is fast paced and a great read. Enjoy reading books that take place in Europe. Looking forward to reading the lost symbol.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I'm a woman who has come through many versions of how women function in the workplace. This book was great at illustrating those challenges and discussing ideas to overcome some of them. We can all be better and this book helps us be so.  I think there is a lot of very simple fundamentals that we as women don't learn and then, when we do, don't think to share those with women as they come up. This book highlights some of those so we can all advance.
B009HSPODE|4.0|Each and every one of the stories are very well written, as you would expect of a Nobel laureate. I would have given 5 stars if there was even just a hint of joy in one of the stories.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Good old time entertainment.  Easy or challenging, you choose.  Lots of great themes.  I love the famous paintings and animals.
B000M341RI|4.0|It's a joy.  Not a terribly important work, but my wife loves it.  I bought it for her as a little gift and I was delighted with her delight.  She is a bit of a Pollyanna, and who can blame someone for that?, and she finds the movie a reaffirmation of hope in a dark time.  She has developed a strong admiration of Robert Carlyle, who plays the leading role, and that led us to <i>Stargate Universe</i> which pleased us both (although the science is looser that loose).  There are people you know who will just adore this and they explain why this has become such a cult object.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Like it or not Eminem, it is the best in his field, he proves once again with his new album. Rap god is back.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|I bought this set after having read several site's reviews. My experience was still better than my expectations. The set is nice and compact. Each individual cover reproduces that of the original. The music includes the original album plus out takes, demos and other rarities. The book that is included does a good job of cataloging the music and Harry's life. Amazon did a great job of getting the set to me in a reasonable time and in great condition. This set is a great value for the money.
B0049CVUNG|5.0|The best production of the music of Les Miserables.  The singing, orchestra and presentation could not be better.  The music is much better than the movie that came out this year.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|honestly i just got it for the kids because they seem to like it. but there isnt much to it that isnt like all the rest of the matching games and i dont like the actual candy designs. totally personal, the kids love it
B00AQN09VQ|5.0|Seeing the mixed reviews I was nervous to purchase this set, but when I got it and tested it, I felt it was necessary to write this review. It is a UK produced set, but it will work fine in US machines.  Bought this as a present and so I have tested 2 random episodes from each disc.  All the episodes worked perfectly except I did have an audio issue on one episode in season 1 disc 2 but I tested two extra episodes on that disc and did not have any other issues so I will chalk that up to a scratch or my blue player being old and used.  The video quality is good and looks better than broadcast quality but I cant comment on how it stacks up to other blu ray quality.  The first two seasons did have a terrible choice in color for the title menu options but the other seasons are fine (this is my only complaint).  For how much this set costs it is a definite buy if you don't mind that it is not the official US distribution version, but that doesn't really matter because I got this set for the content not the packaging which is on par with a regular disc set.  In conclusion, I would recommend this set if you do not mind it being the absolute top quality, which probably isn't much different, and you don't mind the packaging not being of collector quality.
B0058VW36U|5.0|fun game and can be challenging! my kids love it, and i dont mind it either really. not annoying and the creatures face is too funny when it misses the candy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved it!! I was always on the edge of my seat waiting for the next  level! It was super fantasticly awesome!!!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Always loved this game and the app for kindle fire is beautiful and super fun.  This app truly enhancing the game play.  Totally impressed!!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This is a great little app that does exactly what I need it to.  I have been looking for something like this for a long time.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Terrible film - nothing but children killing children, and making it appear glamorous. The film has no redeeming qualities. The industry stoops lower and lower.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very interesting reading.  It still does not touch the enigmatic, pure inventive drive that droveTesla.  The confiscation of his papers and equipment  after his death needs to be addressed ans resolved.  There is much the US Goovernment is keeping under wraps to the detriment of all.<br /><br />dsaenzsr
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I grew up on Streisand because my dad loved her music. I have always loved her voice and acting. I've been loving her since the 60's when I was a young girl. This movie moved me so much when I saw it at the theater back in the 80's and I had the soundtrack at some point, but have lost it. So, I decided to just get the movie.
159463176X|4.0|Had not read Hosseini's first two books; didn't know if I would appreciate this one.  But the stories (interconnected) are interesting and give insight into the Afghan culture, now and pre-war.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is one of my favorite Facebook games and to play it on kindle Is a dream come true. The story and questa are easy to do so lets go hunt down some evil together
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Hard to find good television I like, but I like the drama, suspense, and relation of characters. I look forward to watching other seasons!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a fun and challenging game to play. It is a game that can be played by 5 and 55, it really is challenging for all ages. Just reached level 14, and now it wants me to get some more things from the apps store to keep playing, even tho I made the required amount of points to proceed to the next level. Getting a bit frustrated. Wonder if Amazon has checked out this procedure.
1476734941|5.0|A good read, we tried the fasting schedule and after 5 weeks I lost 15 lbs. My wife lost 12lbs. And we never went starving. The pages at the end of the book have a calorie content for everything eatable.

B0087GYY92|5.0|Another good Scalzi book!<br />A bit quirky, a bit different and altogether entertaining.  In SF terms, the books of his I have read are simple stories well told.  This book is one of those - conceptually simple and well told.  An entertaining read but maybe a touch less than the Old Mans War series, which I loved.
B009ME47H2|5.0|You can hear your voice clearly and this was very essential because I needed to sing the national anthem and I really wanted to hear how my voice sounds like. It turns out, that I sing kind of like Marceline from adventure time! This is very awesome.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Good during the first 50% of the book.  Too philosophical last half.  I would not highly recommend this book to friends and family.

006202406X|1.0|Allegiant was possible one of the most disappointing books that I have ever read. Divergent and Insurgent were so well written. In fact, Divergent was my gateway drug to young adult books. The plot was always so intense and you were left what was going to happen next. Allegiant was the opposite. The plot was unimaginative and slow-paced. There are too many plot holes too count. &#34;Lets allow these people to keep procreating and then a bad gene will magically disappear.&#34; The people could figure out how to make a serum to target the exact parts of the brain that produce fear, but they couldn't figure out basic genetics? Hmm. Interesting.<br /><br />The character development is basically non-existent. You can't see any striking contrast between the personalities of Tris and Four. I can't count how many times I was halfway through the second page of the chapter and had to flip back to the chapter's beginning to figure out who was speaking. Maybe she should have used a different font to contrast the two perspectives because they had the same voice to me. Also, in this book I felt like Tobias and Tris' relationship is so shallow. They hardly talk to each other at all but no less than 10 pages later you'll find there is another random make-out scene. Their hallow relationship made those make-out scenes not at all romantic, I rolled my eyes every time.<br /><br />The ending of the book infuriated me. You kill off a main character. Really?! And with a shot in the arm. Not a shot in the stomach, or chest. The arm. Dead. Wow. Any redeeming qualities of the book disappeared at that moment. I guess I should have seen this coming. There's this post on Veronica Roth's blog, where she says that she would have preferred it if Harry had died in the last HP book, because it would have been &#34;by far the most powerful moment of the entire series. And beyond that, an incredible act of heroism.&#34; Garbage. Absolute Garbage. The ending doesn't have to be happy, but it does haveto make sense. I felt no emotional drive that their cause was so important that the main character needed to die for it. You can only kill a character when they are fighting for something absolutely crucial to everyone else' survival. This wasn't epic. It was stupid.  I bought this book, but I'll never read it again. I'll keep it as a lesson to my children that sequels can ruin a whole series. I wish there weren't copy write laws against someone else re-writing the ending. I wanted so badly to like this series ending.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|My cousin loaned me this book and did not provide a single warning.  I tackled it immediately since Amazon only allows you 14 days for a loaned e-book.  I absolutely devoured this book.  The story was heart-wrenching and I probably need therapy after reading it but it was well done.  I haven't read very much Young Adult or 'New Adult' since the  genre has become a 'thing'. Yet, in the few that I've read, I'm always taken aback by the intensity of the feelings expressed, and its mostly by the guys.  As I'm a good decade past that Young Adult/New Adult age maybe that's how they roll these days and I just wasn't aware.  But it is surprising to see the depth of emotion from characters that are so young. That said, I'd recommend you read it, just don't be shocked if your eyes sweat a little bit when you do.
030758836X|5.0|This story had me guessing all the way to the end.  What a twist!  Sociopathology under a microscope!  The device of different diaries from the perspective of both sides of the couple was unique.

B0034DGPEU|2.0|I was not impressed. The plot contained nothing original and every character was a cliche. At least the author left the happy ending fairly subtle.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Saw this outstanding show on broadway and needed to have the music to replay at will.  Good walking and/or jogging music.
B00AEBB8BU|4.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only, not the movie itself.  The Blu-ray version of 3 Days of the Condor offers only a slight improvement over an upscaled DVD.  While it has a bit more detail, there is noticeable film grain--in some cases significant grain.  Some scenes actually look out-of-focus at times.  It is difficult to know whether the issue was with the transfer, the condition of the source materials or simply the way it was filmed.  Colors are not strong--a feature of many movies from that era.  The sound was adequate, but nothing special.<br /><br />This is not the best Blu-ray transfer that I have seen.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, I do not think it is worth it.  Hang on to your DVD until they come out with a better edition.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Rowling tried too hard to convince the reader that she was beyond the &#34;children's&#34; category.  There wasn't enough substance to the story.  I didn't dislike it, but was disappointed by it.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it always asks you to install an update and if you don't want to update you have to anyway because it won't go away. I think you should get the update and be done with it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Our pets are always there from the moment we choose them or they choose us, fate has us intertwined with them. We think we go on with our lives only with minor changes; feeding them, walks, etc but to them we become their whole world. They watch us, study us and, as the book shows, their own view of our life events. This is definitely one of the finest books I've read, from the first chapter you know have an idea of how the book is going to end but joining Enzo as he retells his life and his master's life through his eyes is an incredible journey which you will not regret taking and you may even value your pets a little more afterwards.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I was aware when I bought this cd/dvd release that it did not contain the complete Portofino concert but, where Andrea Bocelli is concerned, half a concert is better than no concert at all. The dvd alone is worth the price. Not only has Andrea got one of the most beautiful and intriguing voices in the world, he is also a very endearing stage performer.<br /><br />I had not expected much from the cd, as it is largely a repetition of Passione, but I have listened to it and enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The studio recordings include versions I have not heard before, such as 'Champan' and 'Autumn Leaves', which must have been taken from the Spanish Pasion and Amor. I also loved the live performances.  'Something Stupid' has proved to be a real gem, beautifully paced and sung with great style.<br /><br />All in all, the cd exceeds my expectations and the dvd is just as delightful as I had hoped.

B008I43DYU|4.0|At times I don't have a  pocket calculator handy so this app comes in handy. It's not failed me yet.
B005FVNIW6|3.0|I enjoyed the book. It reads like a YA novel, somewhat dystopian with a smattering of sci fiction. A bit outdated with references to Warsaw Pact, given it was first written in the 80's, and training and education seemed focused on perfecting video game skills, so much so I suspect Nintendo had a part in the publishing.  Battle games played in the zero gravity room were the basis of determining military leaders of the future  The power of anonymous commenters on the Net was also somewhat amusing, and most bizarre of all a war where battles are led by an 11 yo commander light years away from his troops while thinking he was just playing a game.<br /><br />As with most YA novels, there is the young vs old battle being played out.<br /><br />I liked the ending which sets up the next book in the series nicely.  Hopefully the rest of the series takes on a more mature and believable theme so I can rate it a bit higher.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I got so happy when you made an original facebook for the kindle fire HD, I love the app<br /><br />  Ps. Thanks!
B00EKQ3YZI|5.0|This cd is not simply a remix project of Donna's earlier hits. It is a very modern take that puts songs from decades ago into the new dance music scene. Donna songs are always full of joy and big vocals. While these retooled workings take out her patented sing-a-along melodies, the beats are very fresh and very current. The entire cd gives me goosebumps. I love it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book, it was super interesting the whole way though I never got bored while reading it! You should definitely read this book!

B00GBQI0M2|4.0|From slave to mistress to wife to owner of a plantation, Marea now faces a very different and life altering choice, that of becoming a vampire. And the vampire Delano, so entranced with the exotic Marea that he can barely control himself, impatiently pushes to make her one of his own. This short novella, also found in &#34;Vampire Romance to Rippers, an Anthology of Risque Stories,&#34; tells of their desires and ultimate transformation, leaving the reader wanting to know more about both Delano and Marea. Author notes at the end of the story reveals there are additional upcoming books, one involving Delano, and that the current story is a prequel for another book in the series continuing the story of Marea. Please note that this novella contains explicit sex scenes. Disclosure: I was provided with a copy of this novella in exchange for an honest review.
1623360277|5.0|Dr. McDougall dispells many myths about food in this well-documented book.  He takes his readers on a journey of the eating habits of successful large populations, to help illustrate the case for his ultimate conclusion: that a diet consisting mainly of starches, fruits and vegetables will keep you slim and healthy.<br /><br />With the goal of eating healthier, I have been eating as much food as I want on this diet for the past 3 months.  One of the pleasant (and surprising) side effects of eating these foods was:  I lost 22 pounds.  My main goal was to dump one of my blood pressure medications, a beta blocker which was causing unwelcome side effects.  Gratefully, I was able to eliminate this blood pressure medication after just three months on this diet.<br /><br />The acid test of any theory is:  how does it work?  For me, this diet is working extremely well.  Compared to the SAD, one of the benefits is that I have been able to eat as much as I want of foods that taste really good.  In addition to losing weight, my chlorestoral level has also dropped dramatically.<br /><br />One of the most interesting chapters for me was the discussion of salt and sugar, which was also well documented.  People who like a little sugar in their oatmeal, and a little salt in their food will find good news in this chapter.<br /><br />So, with only good news to share, count me in for life!
006202406X|1.0|why, why, I expected more than this. I really didn't like it. it is just the a really bad book.

B00GFJQS8S|5.0|What many people don't understand about &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; is that it isn't just a graphic novel turned dramatic series. And while it may get painted into the genre, it certainly isn't just a show about zombies. &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; is an episode-by-episode case study of morality, ethics, right versus wrong and the struggle of the human condition. You could build a college-level curriculum around its content. Hell, I would teach it! Within every character's development--within every decision made--there are hours of worthwhile, relevant and applicable ‘grey-area’ discussions to be had. Furthermore, the evolution of conscience doesn't end with the show's key players; the viewers themselves become a part of the equation! From the pilot episode to &#34;Indifference&#34; (or that is to say, right now) there is a persistent sense of metamorphosis on either side of the screen and I, for one, find it simply fascinating! Somewhere within &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; you will see yourself. That--and not the zombie feeding frenzies--might be the terrifying part. Masterfully done.
B008NAFU9A|4.0|This is Ophelia's story, who was a minor but important character in the first book, The Forever Girl. In this book, Her Sweetest Downfall, which I love the title, you learn her story and how she became who she is. This was a good companion to the series because you not only learned about her story but about how Queen Callista came to be also. I did like this one but Ophelia was a little too distrustful when it was clear that things were in front of her and she failed to see it. But there was a sad part where she was so adamant about something that you really hoped it was true too. But all in all, I liked the character and the story. A nice and quick read. A beautiful cover, just like The Forever Girl.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I feel like I wasted my time reading all three of the books with the ending that Veronica Roth gave us. Life is hard enough as it is, the least an author can do is give us an ending to hope and wish for in our own lives. I wish I had read it fast enough so I could have asked for my money back.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Do not read this book unless you want to read something somber and depressing. Worst ending to a trilogy I've ever read, it was hopeless and left a bad taste.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I will begin by stating this is truly the first book I have read where the negative, one-star reviews largely outweigh all others. I assumed this was due to the unpopularity of the story's ending, but soon realized that was incorrect. For me, the book seemed to be written by a different author completely unrelated to this series! The alternating POVs in this installment definitely did not work, and not because it wasn't necessary to tell the story.  The characters lacked so much depth and development that it was difficult to distinguish between them both. I found myself referring back to the chapter title just to confirm which POV I was reading numerous times throughout the story. The first two books in this series flowed wonderfully, a good mix of action and character development. This book fell completely flat. Ms. Roth's choice to end this book the way she did certainly did strike a negative chord with Divergent fans. However, I respect the author's choice to tell the story as she is inspired to do. That is, as long as its purpose IS to tell the story. This ending seemed forced and to intentionally promote \\"shock value\\".  Not all books have to have a happy ending. Some are sad. Some are tragic. All should leave the reader feeling something.  This one left me feeling I wasted my time waiting for the final book.
1400052181|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The contrast between the lives of poverty, poor health and lack of opportunity of Henrietta Lacks' family and the superb contribution to science and healing of her living cells was powerful.  This is the way the world works, then and now.  If her family had received .01% of the profits made by laboratories on reproducing and selling her cells for medical research, their lives would have been tremendously improved.  The author did not editorialize but her straightforward writing powerfully conveyed the human message of this brilliant book.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book kept me entertained, but it was not an &#34;outstanding, you have to read this, etc.&#34; type book. It is an easy read, and it gets much better once the secret is actually revealed, but that takes a little bit of reading.
0670024856|2.0|I give Elizabeth Gilbert A for effort but the seams all show.  It seemed very contrived to me.  The lascivious aspect seemed added to give balance to the botany tameness.  She did her homework in naturalism but she did her homework in what sells also.  She hit the jackpot with her bestseller and has tried to reach literature here.  It is a total miss.
6305433909|5.0|Great sequel to an amazing start.  Loved the storyline and the songs.  &#34;Oh Happy Day&#34; is my favorite song and I try to do it justice when I sing it at my church.  Just loved the whole movie and I play it when I just need to feel good.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Boring after the first few levels because some of the clues are never explained. Such as, no color equals black. Would never have figured that one out without help.

006202406X|1.0|Flew through first 2 books in a matter of 3 days...I love that feeling when you just can't put a book down.  When your not reading it your thinking about it and aching to get your hands on it to pick back up! Allegiant was so NOT that same experience.  To be honest by the end of the book I was hoping a huge bomb would just explode on the country and end everyone's suffering including mine.  I had to force myself to read the next chapter and the next day after day.  Thinking ok maybe something exciting will freakin finally happen...nope!  This book was such a waste of my time and money. By the end of the book I didn't care who died...I lost interest in the characters by then.  The author seriously must have lost interest in her characters as well because that was the only thing I saw happening while I read this waste of trees and ink! Not sure I even want to see the movie now if this is the ending I have to look forward to. Hollywood better save this mess and rewrite a better script/story line for 3rd book.  Please inject me with memory serum so I can erase this boring book from my mind!!!

0345530578|2.0|What? Grisham wrote this?  The BASIC storyline could have been great - but the story is SLOOOW, unbelieveable, and boring.  Then, at the very end of the book Grisham comes out with a name which was never mentioned in this book as the person who killed the judge.  Piece-mealed together and the ending was scattered pieces thrown in so there would be an ending.  If he writes another book of this caliber, then he may be trying to tell us he's tired of books on law and lawyers.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was a disappointment. After investing in these characters, I thought the two-character first person was laze, the plot and storyline shifts were thoughtless and the characters suddenly read like high school vampire porn. Frustrating. I was so looking forward to this book and it was simply awful. Sure, the ending was surprising and intense and emotional like always, but that doesn't mean it's good. Still a necessary read for those that have read the other two...or you could just wait for the movie.

B00ESJICMC|5.0|I'm a long time James Blunt fan. Each of his albums has a distinct sound and this one is by far his peppiest with a lot of fast-plucking bass and some techno-y beats. Here are my thoughts, song by song. Keep in mind I’m not a music person so I might not be using the right “terms” but they come from the heart!<br /><br />Face the Sun<br />What it’s about: Sad breakup song but with a more upbeat ending.<br />Best part: Fantastic musical interludes. It picks up and makes your heart race.<br />Favorite line: “All the flowers turn to face the sun.”<br /><br />Satellites<br />What it’s about: The second single released from the album, it’s a social commentary on how people depend on technology and, therefore, miss out on actual human experiences.<br />Best part: His mocking tone when he sings my favorite line.<br />Favorite line: It’s a toss up between the chorus, “Seems that everyone we knows is –  Out there waiting by a phone – Wondering why they feel alone,” or “Did you know none of it’s real if you can’t feel - The beating of someone’s heart.”<br /><br />Bonfire Heart<br />What it’s about: The first single from the album, this one is very reminiscent of bands like The Lumineers and those other bands that have a chorus of people singing together. It has a bluegrass feel.<br />Best part: The chorus of people singing together. It’s just fun.<br />Favorite line:  “Your love is like a soldier, Loyal ’til you die.”<br /><br />Heart to Heart<br />What it’s about: A normal relationship. There are ups and downs and sometimes you don’t know what the other one is thinking, but at the end of the day you see “eye to eye and heart to heart.”<br />Best part: He overlaps his own singing with himself. It’s double the fun.<br />Favorite line: “You shine even on a rainy day.”<br /><br />Miss America<br />What it’s about: Whitney Houston. It’s a heartbreaking tribute and once you know it’s about her it’s really obvious.The album also has an acoustic version.<br />Best part: It made me cry.<br />Favorite line: “And I feel like if I know you through the buzz of a song,” because that’s how I feel about James Blunt.<br /><br />The Only One<br />What it’s about: Apologizing to a loved one that you screwed things up with and hoping they still marry you.<br />Best part: The whole song. It’s hands down my favorite on the album, which is why I embedded the video.<br />Favorite line: “Chances are I’ll make it worse - But I need to - Tell you - Tell you that I’m sorry,” because it’s so true.<br /><br />Sun on Sunday<br />What it’s about: A man who doesn’t realize that his love is falling apart in front of them.<br />Best part: It reminds me of an 80′s ballad.<br />Favorite line: “How was I so blind to miss you crumbling inside?” I think we’ve all missed some warning signs when it comes to other people in our lives, whether they are friends or lovers.<br /><br />Bones<br />What it’s about: An unpopular guy who has dreams heads out into the world and feels the adrenaline of life running through his bones.<br />Best part: It made me dance around my living room with my iPad while snapping my fingers.<br />Favorite line: “Never liked the sound of my own voice,” because it’s like he’s mocking the haters.<br /><br />Always Hate Me<br />What it’s about: Realizing that you were a crappy boyfriend when you see your ex with someone else and then thinking they are the cold one.<br />Best part: Everyone can relate. At some point, we’ve all either dated a crappy person or, truth be told, been the crappy person.<br />Favorite line:  ”Never thought I’d drown in my shallow heart.”<br /><br />Postcards<br />What it’s about: Reminiscing about an old love, probably the first.<br />Best part: It has a tropical sound to it, which is reminiscent of my grape dream on the beach.<br />Favorite line: This one was easy because the first verse also reminds me of this. “Sunday sitting on your – back porch - And I came on with a couple of chords - And I played for you…. And as you sit there making daisy chains.”<br /><br />Blue on Blue<br />What it’s about: A guy who loves a girl and is waiting for her answer.<br />Best part: He sings with himself again.<br />Favorite line: “Thought that I will never feel the way that I do.”
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is so addictive. Maybe I should give it a bad review and save you from being addicted too. I like that it is not a timed game. You have a chance to think about your next move. Have fun!
B006FPFTMS|3.0|This is a terrific program for reading and annotating PDFs,...except it suffers from crashes that insidiously got more frequent. It would frequently crash from a document I was reading to the file browser screen, but since it only saves your notes and highlights when you exit the file properly, it would lose all my notes each time it would crash. I'd have to exit and reopen the file each time I made a note to make sure it saved, which was very tedious. Eventually, it got where it will not open any files at all without crashing. I have not tried the customer service, but if I had to rate it as if the crashing weren't an issue, I'd give it 4.5 stars. I like everything but the highlight feature which requires world's smallest fingers to use properly and is somehow much harder to use than Kindle's native highlighting feature that works for e-books.
B009XY5G80|5.0|Absolutely necessary if you're serious about literature. While later sections are complicated and difficult to read at times, it is only because they are pure poetry.
B00E0F9J44|3.0|Overpriced, and not as good as another CD I bought by her. Fortunately, the second CD I bought by her made up for the disappointment of this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love love this game so addicting !! So very fun and challenging can't put it down type of game !!!!!!!!
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show was fantastic.  If you like the horror genre, you will love this show.  It is filled with endless surprises, twists, and turns.  There are some predictable points, and a few things that are confusing, but overall it's so good.  I couldn't stop watching.  I went through the full season in three days and if I had more time, it would have been in one day.  I'm definitely captured as a fan (and having started to watch season one after season 3 is already underway, I must comment that I absolutely loved the recasting of the actors into completely new roles with each season.  It adds to my interest and intrigue with the show).
030789701X|5.0|It's got everything a true Nord of skyrim needs to be as best as he can be haha. It came looking fresh off of the press, no damage whatsoever.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|An excellent movie. The additional content, whilst only short, really adds to the overall experience. If you loved the movie, you should really add this to your collection
0486438600|5.0|I like to color with gel pens and glitter pens. I also use some of the patterns for embroidery patterns. Love these type books. They have some unique patterns in this book. I love it. Thank you.
B003XE1DR4|5.0|I love these shoes because they fit well and are not too large and floppy.  My problem with two previous pairs of &#34;Croc-Like&#34; shoes is that they were so large that I tripped and fell in them.  Got rid of them and have hestitated buying another pair, but am very happy with these.  Have also gotten compliments and questions on how I like them, so others are also interested in Crocs that they don't trip in.
B000W27AE0|3.0|A few good songs, much sounds like background sounds for halloween. Fairly disappointing, Computer says need more words, best if I stop now.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Got it as a free app. it's really cute and really fun. It's easy in the beginning, but it can get quite challenging.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Belisimo  e  perfetto !!!!!  This is their best album yet!!!!  It is wonderful to listen to even when it is not Christmas.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love the piano guys. Their music always cheers me up and it is always great and fun to listen to. Great for all ages. I own all their music and its been one of the best music purchases I have ever made.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book!  I found it to be extremely touching. I loved the parallel between Vivian and Molly. Don't miss an opportunity to peek into the lives of children who keep searching for permanence in a world that has torn them from their families.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Well it did look real and its fun I love it just to bad I'm not allowed to pay for it... but I would if I could... you should try it!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my niece said that she went all the way to level 70 and finally saved 35 gems for Rarity and also Sweetie Belle and unlocked all elements but almost unlocked Twilight's but then there was an update then she said she dident really visit it everyday so she visit it this one day then is said &quot;not plug in&quot; or something she really dident remember and then it closed she kept opening it an praying it will open the game and not see that &quot;not plug in&quot; sign but no matter how many times she tried it dident work and of course she was sad and cried one tear the she uninstalled it then re-installed then her progress was lost and she had to start from scratch and decided to take it as a challenge so she's noe level 14 or 13 I think and connected to Gameloft but. lost her friends but she's okay with it and she is saving gems for Rarity then Rainbow she told me when she was level 70 SHE WAS RICH! and now she dosent have that much bits anymore but shes okay she told me to give a 5 star review cuz its her fab show ...so your lucky she gave you 5 stars
