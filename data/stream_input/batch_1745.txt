1451638450|1.0|Rather than a review , since , despite YEARS of waiting for Ivan's story, I have not been able to read it yet ...this is an invitation to Ms Bujold , or to her publisher , to seriously consider making a Kindle version available as soon as possible . I am aware that this issue has already been raised by another reader but I would like also to underline my own severe disappointment. While it is true that it would have been perfectly possible for me to order the hard-back version OR to enrol and download the audio book for free OR have pre- ordered it OR have got it from marketplace or any other solution , that it is NOT what I wanted .. I wanted to read Ivan's story the moment it became available , meaning for an ex-patriate like me  \\"on my Kindle\\" , download time 35 seconds from America and reading a nano-second after !Price was not an object...but, given that it is only the VERY rare book that has its publishing date marked on my calendar , I'd really have appreciated being able to give myself that treat .<br />Only hubris would imagine that I am alone in feeling that such choices by the publisher/ author in the end leave readers feeling disatisfied , deluded or defrauded :in the sense only of being denied emotional connection with characters they have grown love and whose continuing story brings a sense of completion . Ms Bujold's greatest skill lies perhaps in that ..in making her readers not only willing \\"to suspend disbelief\\" but eager to do so in order to live the story with her protagonists, characters who truly become people whose destiny we care about .<br />So , if any one else feels the same way, would they like to add their voice to mine ?<br />Lynn Tamalio Wright

1589269071|5.0|This book is a testament to the fact that every person we meet in an intimate situation is different. \\"Different strokes for different folks\\" as they say. I love the way the author laid out the different love languages with case studies and everything. I easily identified my own love language, and it was really an eye opening experience. I think that the love languages system is a good way to open up communication with your mate as to what you both need from the relationship. It's straight forward and not too out there so that anyone can relate. I would definitely recommend this book if you want to better understand yourself and your mate better.

1400064287|5.0|I love this book. And it is sticking to me weeks after I have read it just once. If you want to convey a message, any message, and need maximum impact, then you should pick up you own copy of this book.<br /><br />Sure, you could check it out at the library, read it and feel like you got it. But then it won't jump out at you from your bookshelf 3 months later when you need to explain to your wife why you bought that red ninja motorcycle out of the blue. You won't have that nagging voice at arm's reach to come to your rescue when you have to sell your entire client list the price hike next month. And you will not have its powerful insights readily available to you when you are launching a new product, division or business.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for purchase. I rarely review books and I don't like collecting them to fill my bookshelf. But this is one that I bought and I very pleased that I did.<br /><br />It is all about crafting your message so that it communicates long after it is introduced.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|BEST SHOW ASIDE FROM BREAKING BAD. ITS LOST MEETS SURVIVOR MEETS ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE. THE CHARACTERS ARE GREAT AND THEY KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES TRYING TO STAY ALIVE. MY FAVORITE SHOW RIGHT NOW.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|Most styli come with a soft sponge tip on one end and a pocket clip on the other.  The problem is that the tip wears out fast and you don't really need the pocket clip.  You certainly don't need the plastic tip that hangs from the top because you shouldn't be putting it into the hole where you insert your headphones/ear plugs anyway.  Not unless you want to risk it breaking off inside, then never being able to use headphones or earplugs again.<br /><br />So, I bought the older Amazon Basics stylus which comes without the pocket clip.  It's smooth and I like the way it works with a firm tip that doesn't wear down fast and nothing to get in the way so I can turn it around and use the tip evenly.  The only problem with it is that it doesn't have anything to stop it from rolling.  So, it rolls off the desk and onto the floor every time I put it on a surface.  It would make more sense if there were a sponge tip at each end because it's not like that other end is used for anything.  There's a hanging triangular thing at the other end, which is just for show, so I removed it.<br /><br />Then in walks the new, and definitely improved, Amazons Basics stylus.  It not only has a sponge tip at each end, it also has a removable cap with yet a third sponge tip.  Each tip is a different width.  The thin width is perfect for clicking on links.  I usually need to expand the view just to click the link with the fat tips, but the thin tip captures the link without doing so.  The best part about having a cap is that you can remove it when using the stylus, and putting it back on when you're done stops the stylus from rolling.  Its texture is a bit rough, which makes handling it easier than the smooth Amazon Basic stylus mentioned above.  All-in-all a winner.<br /><br />Four stars because the tips are softer than the older Amazon Basics stylus.  And, I've found the softer tips wear out faster.  But, if that's not the case, I'll change the rating.
B0050LJIRK|4.0|It Was A Great album,Probably Better than their last two.<br />Gold Cobra was the best track on the album.<br />Finally I give It 4stars.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This is probably the best case I have seen for a tablet. The Kindle Fire HD snaps right in, no elastic bands, no flimsy leather border that leaves a residue on your expensive piece of tech. It's a hard, durable, piece that fits the Kindle Fire HD securely. The swivel feature is great. Although, it's really a bit difficult to turn. I imagine this is because they wanted to make sure the Kindle will stay secure in any position, and it definitely does. I expected a rotation to be a bit smoother though. The case itself is very sleek and durable. The leather is nice quality, the padding on the inside is very soft. The elastic band that holds it closed is strong and stitched well. If I can sum up this case in a single word it would be \\"Sturdy.\\" Just having it in your hand you can feel that this was built to take punishment and built to last. I would definitely recommend this case for anyone looking for a nice case for their Kindle Fire HD.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|I am a health care professional (nurse) and have sat at many bedsides of dying patients.  This book provided me with a fresh insight into near death experiences and while not promoting any one religion, I found her revelations remarkable.  After reading this, I will now try to feel my own magnificence and apply that to all aspects of my life.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has suffered a terminal illness, lost a loved one due to terminal illness, medical professionals, spiritual teachers or ministers, well, just about everybody.  Just buy it and read it, you won't regret it!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|In his review of this book, my local crime fiction reviewer said that this book showed Ian Rankin as a mature writer at the top of his form, and I agree with him unreservedly. It was great to have Rebus back working cold cases and hoping to return to his old job as the retirement age has been lifted. A triumph.
0375507256|5.0|I absolutely love this book so far. I'm only 100 pages in and I love it. The way Mitchell writes is phenomenal. Each character jumps out of the book. They are so tangible and interesting, it's like you are seeing them in front of you. If you are looking for something to pass the time, this book gobbles it up.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I bought the first book in the trilogy from a local bookstore and paid over $18.00.  I decided to buy the 2nd and 3rd books and put them on the free Kindle app on my smartphone and my laptop.  It is about half the price of a hard copy and more portable.  A charged group of stories!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a well thought-out story that gradually comes together as past and present chapters get closer and closer to each other. Each chapter is written from either the husband's or wife's perspective which gives you a glimpse into both minds...until you're hit with the twists and turns that make everything you thought you knew was true completely wrong. You will never predict the outcome of any event in this story. Great exploration of a truly disturbed person! Loved it!

B0056CUZRA|5.0|\\"Fall of Giants\\" is the first of Ken Follett's books that I have read. It will not be the last. The novel very successfully gives personality and background to a range of characters in different stations of life in the Britain of the early twentieth century. Romances are believable and appear as part of people's lives with their concomitant repercussions, as do political ideals and practical actions. Whether working in a Welsh coal mining village or living in aristocratic privilege in London, the characters make choices which have far-reaching implications, for themselves and others.<br /><br />The writing had me enthralled. I shall be looking for the other books of this trilogy, as well as Follett's earlier works.
B009VB998I|5.0|As a 60 year young lover of cartoons, I was pleased with Tinkerbell's new adventure. The movie has good pacing, and I surmise would keep the younger viewer entertained. I remain glad that Disney decided to present this icon with her own starring role and adventures.
0060752610|5.0|How to become an intelligent Investor?<br /><br />Benjamin Graham is famous with the fact that one of the most famous investor, Warren Buffett was taught by him in Columbia business school. So I choose this book to read since I was curious of the figure, Benjamin Graham. The book `Intelligent Investor' deals with the financial concepts such as stock investment, the inflation relates to bond investments and interest rates. Hence, this book was very helpful to understand at not only the investment, but also the sense of finance. I believe that this book indicates that these two concepts are very considerable; `Margin of Safety', and `Uncertainty'. These two concepts were Graham's fundamental concepts.<br /><br />Benjamin Graham sees the principle of investment of common stock as follow. 1. It's good have diversified investment, minimum 10, maximum 30. 2. Selected stock type should be large-cap stock, have high prospects at performances, and should be a risk based capital. 3. Selected stock type should have a consistency over distributed performances. 4. Should restrict on purchase price over the company's annual average net income per share for past 7 years.<br /><br />And then, after comparing 4 listed company, above principles' detailed numerical value was shown in follows; 1. Moderate company scale. 2. Strong financial position. 3. At least 20 years of consistently distributed performances. 4. At least for 10 years, more than one-third growth of EPS. 5. Stock prices per share do not go over than 1.5 times of net asset value. 6. Stock prices do not go over more than 15 times of average EPS in recent 3 years.<br /><br />I read this book throughout the weekend again. I read this book couple of weeks ago one time, and I started re-read this book again. It was kinda hard to understand this book at the first time, however as I read them over, I started to understand a bit better. Honestly, I just do not prefer the individual stock investment, thus I thought how BenjaminGraham's way of selecting stock was very interesting, however I never really thought that I need to change the index investment strategy for that. Instead, the definition of initial investment and speculation, and concept of margin of safety were the part that could be able to apply in anyways of stock investment, hence it was very good chance to refresh the investing mind. Especially, I love to read the chapter 20. It was the description of margin of safety, which explains that to earn profits in stock market; we need to approach with long-term mind while securing the minimum safety margin.<br /><br />When I read this book through, what I felt first was that I have to put my assets into cash, stock, and real estate while evenly distribute. Every type of assets have their own pros and cons, hence it is always good to have evenly distributed on the different type of assets. In this way, even if the certain market has failed to perform high valuation, the others may not. The second thought about the diversification was I would invest in high, middle, and low risk investment.<br /><br />In Wall-street, with all that passions, researches, and talents there are a lot of cases losing money. It is actually common to lose. Thus, our goal of investment should be not to earn more than the average, but to earn money that will satisfy my needs. That is, not to win markets, nor to pass the goal faster than some other figure. It is just to reach the goal and pass that finish line though. It doesn't matter how fast nor how slow it may take. To accomplish this important goal, we need to make realistic estimation for the future, and to purchase the stock with the price that can secure enough safety margins. Also through the long-term investment and diversified investment, we need to endeavor to manage the risk of the investment. Additionally, I believe that we can finally become a intelligent investors when we trust and take pluck on our own analysis and investment.<br /><br />At last, Benjamin Graham mentioned in his book that `If a person sets out to make profits from security purchases and sales, he is embarking on a business venture of his own, which must be run in accordance with accepted business principles if it is to have a chance of success.'<br /><br />With the four principles that he explained in this book, he explains that `To achieve satisfactory investment result is easier than most people realize; to achieve superior results is harder than it looks.'<br /><br />Especially in these days, everything change so fast and the trend of yesterday is different with that of today. However, the book `Intelligent Investor' that was written by Benjamin Graham and published in 1949. It is actually very amazing that how the principle of investment that was written in 1949 is still considered as the best investment book in nowadays. It is still a steady seller from the Amazon as well. One of reasons this book is so popular and grabs investors' attention is how this book has focused on the upright investing principles and the attitudes that investors should have, instead saying the methods of stock analysis, nor trading techniques.<br />I definitely recommend this book to the individual investors. There is another famous book of Benjamin Graham called, `Security Analysis', however this book may be difficult to read for individual investors. I heard this book is more targeted towards the professional analyst. However, this book that I read, `Intelligent Investor' is more likely towards the individual investors. Hence, again I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is hesitating to start reading this book. It may hard to read for the beginners of investment however it should be the must-read book before even starting investment. At the same time, for who is actively performing investors, it is good way to remind the basic principle that must not to be forgotten.<br />For me, it was great way to refresh the investing mind, and I would love to suggest this book towards my friends as well.
0786891416|5.0|If you're looking for a \\"real\\" novel with serious character development, etc. etc. look elsewhere.<br /><br />On the other hand, it you love the show and want another episode, this is for you. To me, it's that simple. Not looking for some kind of \\"deep thought\\" reading, just want more Castle! :) And while others have commented that the book isn't long enough, it seemed fine to me and had plenty of twists and turns.<br /><br />The really amazing thing to me is the poor author(s) who has a NYT best selling book but can't tell anyone! I'm guessing it's probably one of the script writers. Maybe he/she will be able to claim authorship after the show finishes.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|This is a very good book and is definitely worth the money. I reccomend you to buy or even borrow to read.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|As I mentioned in my review of the first book, I view these as simply another Castle episode. Not looking for great writing or in depth character development; just give me another episode.<br /><br />That being said, this one did seem to have a few loose ends but I'm a very forgiving person so, OK. Was interesting to learn about how gossip columnists work.<br /><br />Looking for the next one.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Would give it no stars if I could. Like many other reviewers, I'm very frustrated with this APP. I've unistalled and reinstalled on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, but whenever I go to browse the newsfeed I get a few posts down and it will just spin and spin like it's loading but never load anything else.  This needs to be fixed for the 8.9 version please!  I don't go on Facebook very often, so when I do I want to see more than just a few items in my newsfeed.  I am amazed that Amazon has not fixed this yet considering how many reviewers have said the exact same thing.  Very disappointed.

B00AA7O22U|3.0|This movie was what I thought it was going to be over the top with bad acting, with that in mind good movie for 4 bucks. If you thought this was going to be some else than you did not pay close attention to the first movie or did not see it.  Somethings you have to take as is.
1469984202|4.0|First, I must say that any book that is hard for me to put down and leaves me wanting more has done a great job. I did love this book. I am writing this review about an hour after finishing and less than a week after starting.  Part of me sees this book not unlike many of the great shows that I grew to love. My biggest frustration with the book were the questions left unanswered. But yet many were. I think back to my favorite show LOST and how it did a great job of weaving you into the story, leaving you wanting so much answered. WOOL does this as well. Part of me would love to see a part six and beyond, to see these characters lives unfold even more, and yet... like our own lives, only so much can be told. In summary, this is a must-read for me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was an amazing book, loved every minute of it.  The characters are interesting and just kept me wanting more. One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Hated it to end.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed her other three novels immensely and was anxious for this fourth one to be released.  The beginning does start a little slowly and it can be a tiny bit confusing with the time-shifts, but stick with it.  It picks up quickly.  Beautifully written, authentic characters, just lovely.  I've started re-reading it a second time because the twist at the end caught me completely by surprise.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I got this app called dragon story and it is awesome! When my kids got this they were so exited.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|All of these comments are modulo IMO only, personal taste will come through. I'm not rehashing the synopsis - you already know it.<br />It was a faithful enough rendering of the Larsson story. I think Craig worked extremely well, I was pleasantly surprised by his subtle repertoire of gestures, movements and facial expressions that spoke volumes.  Mara was fantastic but not as perfect a fit for Salander. The crucial scene imo was her `Terminator Mode' when attacking Bjurman, Mara was simply not ferocious enough.<br />Way too much talking and techno-explanation, no need to follow the book, everyone knew there was a camera there, all she had to do was turn on the TV - done. On the other hand the fact that her laptop was broken is so easy to miss at the end of the subway shot. This, imo, was important in linking why she needed money.<br />The editing is absolutely top notch, it tells the story effortlessly, won the Academy I think. Photography and setting are perfect. Bits are changed from the book and some are borrowed from the second book, but no biggie. Great twist - and deviation from the book -about Harriet near the end.<br /><br />Coolest Scene: Salander is asking Craig - 007 licensed to kill - Blomkvist \\"May I kill him?\\" What do you think he said? ;)<br />Hardest to watch: Salander trying to shower after the brutality. In that few seconds scene is her entire character and Mara nails it. You can feel the horror and agony. (As I recall it's also the first time we get to see the dragon)<br />Sweetest scene: Blomkvist runs his hand up her back as she is lying face down hacking away, when he removes it she says, \\"Put your hand back on my back.\\" 100% feminine. And Craig - with the typical clueless duffus male look- does exactly as she instructs. Perfection.<br />Best technical moment: She is writing a query - not typical system/app code - to do a database search. That made me smile.<br />Most subtle: Everyone is using an Apple machine, except the killer, it looked likea PC monitor. (And no - I hate Apple and their - It's my way or the hiway. And yes - the wife (aka the master) *made* me buy two iMacs)<br /><br />Side comment: Salander is - again IMO - one of my favorite Science Fiction characters of all time The Stainless Steel Rat - Jim DiGriz<br /><br />Aside: The graphic novel - Vol I. OMG I was almost physically sick.

B009EAO38C|5.0|ThePianoGuys are a phenomenal combination of talent. Jon's creativity on the piano paired with Steve's amazing talent on the cello combine to make music that is a joy to listen to. I listen to this album at work, with my kids in the car, and at home on the weekends. The brilliance of this album is the combination of classical instruments with modern music to create a classical modern masterpiece. This album is a must buy for anybody who loves piano/new age/classical music.

B003GXJ072|5.0|In 1979, Ridley Scott created the most influential Sci-Fi movie of the modern film era in Alien. All subsequent film of this genre are compared to this work. It is as fresh today as it was over 40 years ago. The technology, characters, suspense and sense of being alone in space are still unmatched.<br />Alien is an unqualified must-see, must-own recommendation to all Sci-Fi fans.

0345803485|1.0|This is some of the worst writing ever.  It is also insulting on so many levels; what an a-hole and why on earth would that pathetic girl put up with it??  Also hard to believe from the beginning due to her school - WSU Vancouver campus?  Please.  Author clearly has never been there.  Why not something more respectable and a little sexier - what was wrong with U W?  Stanford???  Something less lame???  When Ana mentions her GPA it's ironic b/c you don't need a high GPA for that school and if you HAD a high GPA you would not be involved with this man.<br />Words used far too often:  tenacious; inner-goddess; envisage; lovely; white linen shirt (you don't see that many of those in the Seattle area); \\"oh my;\\" baby; beguiling - the list goes on.  Use a thesaurus next time.<br /><br />Not sexy.  I have read sexier passages in books that aren't sold as soft porn.  It does seem like it was written by a 20 year old (Ana's mom is 42?  And it is referenced as old?) BUT it's a 20 year old who is laughing all the way to the bank as the book has sold many many copies.  Lucky woman.  I am glad I didn't spend any money on the copy I borrowed from a friend...I think I can pass on Book 2 & 3.  Better to read the Harry Potter or Twilight series.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This was a ravishing book. You may be tempted to get bogged-down and quit before the big payoff. Don't. When it all starts fitting together, it is mind-blowing. Mitchell is definitely a wordsmith and has quite a way with aphorisms. There are many great quotes in this book.<br /><br />It is not really a reincarnation story, although you can read it as such. It is about story itself and how the narratives we create for ourselves shape our reality. It is also, of course, about how stories are interconnected.<br /><br />My advice, aside from sticking with it, are to read the book before you see the movie, if you see the movie. Also, try The 1000 Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, a Mitchell book that is more of a traditional narrative or as much of one as you'll get with him and also pretty glorious.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book did a lot in positive aspects and a little in positive aspects. It was a perfect “Middle-man“ to the trilogy. It gave away the right amount of info while leaving the reader with many questions. It's hard to pull that off.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Great action along with the John Corey humor. Excellent read that fits in with the earlier Corey books including The Lion
B00846REIS|3.0|First of all, a lot of people are comparing this book to Fifty Shades of Grey. I actually decided to read it because I had really enjoyed Fifty Shades and was looking for something similar. Two individuals who meet and begin a tumultuous relationship is about all the two series have in common. There is a Dominant and Submissive aspect to the relationship in Bared to You, but I assure you it is not anything like that in Fifty Shades, there's no toys, no red room of pain, etc. That being said, Bared to You was a decent read. It wasn't a \\"I cant put this down\\" type (at least not for me), but I did find myself wondering what would happen next, therefore, had the desire to at least finish the book. I did not really like the beginning of the book, it all seemed very fast and sudden in an unbelievable sort of way, but the pace got better as the book went on. Another reader commented on the sex scenes being too many to the point it almost makes you just want to skip over them. I dont think there were too many of them, but 5 orgasms in what seems to be a 20 minute sex session...? Really? Seems a bit ridiculous. All in all, I don't know if I would recommend this book, I suppose it would depend on who was asking for a suggestion.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really enjoyed the book! this is the fiction I enjoy, page-turner that takes me away from the daily routine! smart and I  can enjoy the creativity and imagination of Grisham! Nice twist and I can imagine it being a movie…
B00A8ECU24|5.0|What you'd expect to be a simple kid game filled with easy mini games is actually a well made strategy /time game. It's a nice game based on realtime and money management. Super fun. :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this as a daily deal, and I'm glad I bought the omnibus edition. The writing was solid, and I found myself getting really absorbed in the story. There were some good surprises and I was glad when the series continued. The separate editions are of varying lengths and it seems more like it makes one good book, so I recommend getting the omnibus over buying the separate stories.
B0060D0Z0G|5.0|This by far is one of my favorite movies.  Excellent acting and I do love that horse. Movie is exciting even after watching it several times the last race is by far most exciting.  I would recommend to anyone who loves horses.
B008D28HYS|4.0|First time with this sort of game and find it enjoyable.<br />Tricky for someone that is partially color blind but easy to figure out.
B005LAII9O|2.0|This movie really proves that Stone, needs to choose his projects a little better, this movie felt like it was dragged out and the ending was just confusing and stupid, it felt like the filmmakers just said hey let's throw some action in here that's very convoluted and ciched, and then let's confuse the shit out of the viewers.<br /><br />Oh and then there's certain actors in here who for better or worse ham it up big time eg. Del Toro and Travolta.<br /><br />A cheap rental movie at best.
B00843TZJ2|3.0|I probably will be repeating what many other reviewers have said but I'll add my thoughts.  First of all, Crosby, Stills and Nash (and Young) are....or should I say were...an iconic musical group of the folk rock age.  I grew up listening to them having several of their albums, listening to their beautiful melodies and forthright lyrics which are considered classic by anyone's musical standards.<br /><br />  The voices of these once angelic-like harmonious geniouses are gone.  I almost feel embarrassed for them as I listen to them try to recreate the harmonies which were so adored in the past.  In all due respect to Stephen Stills, his voice sounds the worst which unfortunately brings down Graham Nash and David Crosby.  When he sings solo, he sounds a little better, but not much.  But the bad doesn't end with Stills.  Nash sounds a little better but his harmonizing sounds off at times also.  Crosby sounds the best and he seems to carry the others which otherwise would have been like listening to karaoki on a cruise ship.  Believe me, this pains me to be this negative and I kind of feel guilty with this review knowing how much I loved them and still do.<br /><br />Having said all that, the music of CSN speaks for itself and the band does a great job with every song.  No complaints regarding the musicians and production!  But the good stops there.  As a reviewer said, this live recording should not be your first CSN listening experience.  What a shame!  It's almost like watching an athlete who instead of retiring, continued on way too long which diminshed their greatness.  Only a long time fan of CSN (+ Y) will know how truly awesome this group is and will forever be.  I just hope they won't be judged by this live performance.<br /><br />Note:  This is a review of the 2 cds only, not the dvd which I have yet to see.  I'm hoping that watching them perform will put me in a much better frame of mind and will once again recognize their greatness so deserving of CSN.<br /><br />Update:  I watched the dvd!  For some magical reason I was hoping that their voices would sound better.  Sorry to say that they don't.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|More dream or painting than book, this novel is a lovely landscape of surreal images and sensory descriptions. The impressions of each character and setting are so vivid it's easy to imagine the movie -- it almost runs in front of you as you read.<br />A most unusual book, but a very good one.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|It might not be entirely fair to give this book only one star. But I was so annoyed by the quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo that packs its pages that I could not really fairly evaluate the quality of the writing.<br /><br />From what I could gather from the portions of this tome of hogwash that I was actually able to digest, the premise is: Embrace every religion you come across (Be Hindu! Christian! Muslim! Not sure if he got the Jews in there!)! This will lead you to enlightenment/ peace/ wisdom beyond all wise men ever!<br /><br />How is this even remotely coherent?<br /><br />It may amaze the author, but those (often quite wise) people who take their religions and spirituality at all seriously have argued, often to the death, over doctrinal and moral differences for millennia now -- without reaching agreement. Why? Because the basic premise of most religions is that theirs is the only way to god. (And a host of other conflicts about, well, the meaning of morality, the role of God, etc. etc.) So... you can't really be all things to all religions, as warm and fuzzy as that would make us all feel. Sorry.<br /><br />Also -- if the author truly believes that all religions are equal, why not go worship a tree god? And I'm sure Bael would enjoy having a new worshiper as well. Or hey -- I hear the Flying Spaghetti Monster accepts all newcomers.<br /><br />I'm an atheist, so I'm perennially skeptical about anything religious. Nonetheless, I can respect and enjoy a philosophically coherent, intelligently reasoned, or spiritually enlightened book as much as the next person. I would love to read a book that would give me reason to seriously consider that my freethinking ways are wrong. But this? Ugh.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I could not put this book down, period.  I do love to read, but very few books get into my head and mess with me like this one did.  I didn't like the ending at all, but to illustrate how much I didn't like it, I've been talking about it with friends since finishing the book 2 days ago.  I've been disecting the characters, alternate plots, other possible endings, etc.  This, in my mind, is the mark of a great book.  This would be a fantastic book club book!  I've come to realize that while the resolution wasn't a nice tidy package as I would have liked, it probably is the only ending that truly honors the intent of the book (but I still don't like it ;)).
B000FA5SMK|4.0|a good story and plot.  i really enjoy the the quirky commentary.  John Corey is an excellent character and I look forward to reading all the books in the series.  Nelson DeMille keeps the plot moving and is a terrific author.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American Horror Story was amazing and I am so excited that some of the characters came back to star in Asylum! I am always shocked at the story and I always want more when the show ends.
0143034901|5.0|Barcelona in decades past with an interesting cast....  This beautifully<br />written novel has two story lines, both compelling, which invite more<br />reflection and thought.  Some of the characters span both stories.<br />Although a few parts of the story dragged a bit for me, Shadow of the<br />Wind is a keeper--I highly recommend.  My book club informally chose<br />it as our 'best book' this year.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I have never been a fan of the Harry Potter series but I considered  J.K.Rowlings to be an excellent writer. Just the subject matter was not for me.<br />I decided to try her \\"adult\\" book and I loved it. The characters were so real and the story line was so very human, warts and all. I really hope she writes another book for adults. If she does I will be first in line to buy it.

B00975L81Y|4.0|While I wouldn't say Manticore is anywhere close to their best, it definitely brings back a lot of the rawness and roughness of the Cradle albums of yesteryear. Will they ever create something as good as Dusk, V Empire, etc.? Probably not, but after the last couple albums, this is certainly a breath of fresh air. While Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder and Darkly, Darkly Venus Aversa were both solid albums, often times the orchestration drowned and muddled the music and a lot of the songs sounded very similar if not the same. Manticore is much less of this and much more in your face metal. Gone, for the most part, are lyrics of Satanic ideals and vampyric lore, and are instead replaced by folktales and various mythologies, from the in-title Manticore to the Greek Titans, there's a lot of freshness in the lyrics rather than the same sort of thing being spewed again and again.<br /><br />But where the album shines isn't in the lyrics and imagery but in the music itself. This album straight-up ROCKS. Not necessarily in that it's awesome, but rather that it's the sort of music you'd expect to shred your face off. There's still orchestration and synthesizers, but they're pushed to a very minor backdrop to the core focus which is nothing short of balls-out metal. The album starts with a light orchestrated opener (which I might add is probably the closest we've had to a real traditional Cradle opener since Nymphetamine) but quickly slams you against the wall with The Abhorrent and barely lets up until the lighter (which, truthfully, isn't saying much on this album) Frost On Her Pillow and picks right back up through until Sinfonia.<br /><br />If you're a Cradle fan, especially one clamoring for them to go back to the roots, this is a must grab. It's not quite a total return to their roots, but I'll be damned if it's not close, and at worst, it's a fantastic metal album on it's own. Hell, it even focuses less on Dani's screaming vocals and includes much lower growls that we haven't heard since Cruelty and the Beast.<br /><br />I don't know that I can in good conscience put it up to a 5 star rating, but I can with utmost confidence give this a 4. It's a great Cradle album that should satisfy many fans and is probably an excellent starting point for a new fan, alongside albums like Midian and Nymphetamine, before taking the plunge and settling into their early classics.aven't heard since Cruelty and the Beast.<br /><br />I don't know that I can in good conscience put it up to a 5 star rating, but I can with utmost confidence give this a 4.

B007THA4FI|4.0|So I read this not knowing what to except. I knew it wasn't going to be Harry Potter, but had no idea what this was going to be. Rowling showed again that she is a great writer. Be warned though, this book is graphic in language and details. It was a good commentary on society. It was interesting, the characters were very real. if you read it, read it with an open mind and don't expect Harry Potter.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a fun book to read. I really couldn't wait to get back to it each time I had to put it down.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|This movie is the best when it comes to a comedy romance.Bridget(Renee' Zellwegger)is a busy career woman,decides to turn over a new page in her life by channeling her thoughts,opinions and insecurities into a journal that becomes a hilarious chronicle of her adventures.Soon she becomes the center of attention between a who's too good to be true(Hugh Grant)and another who's so wrong for her,he could be just right(Colin Firth)..I have watched this movie quite a few times and it's a movie you can watch over and over again..
0385535147|4.0|According to other reviewers, this is Grisham taking a break from serious fiction. Are they kidding? Is not the mark of a good commercial writer the ability to write page-turning prose that's fresh, fast, and sells a cajillion copies? I have always thought that one of the reasons Grisham is still a top-ranking author is because he hasn't succumbed to \\"series seizure\\" like so many of his peers. He continues to develop great plots, interesting characters, and the only thing that ties them all together is that they revolve around the law somehow.<br /><br />This book is fast, fun, and utilizes a unique twist on foreshadowing. Facts are revealed intermittently and only when the main character, Malcolm, decides to release the info. If you read too fast, you'll miss a couple so I suggest you re-read a couple of pages if you feel you've missed something important; odds are you have.<br /><br />I think it's one of his best. Admitting (in the afterword) that he did little research and that none of the basic locations and situations resemble reality was probably his consience warning him that critics would nail him for that. As a fellow writer, I love the fact that he made a lot of the *&^% up. That's the license that comes with writing creative fiction. Who says we have to verify everything to be factual and accurate in all regards? If it makes sense at the time and the reader isn't left with a \\"that wouldn't work\\" feeling, then it's great writing...even greater big screen fodder.<br /><br />Malcolm, Vanessa, Quinn and Cooley are ripe characters for a fun and frivolous flick in the vein of the popular heist movies of the 80s and 90s. The actors would be lighthearted but believeable: Maybe Jamie Foxx if he can rein it in a bit. Even the FBI foil, Westlake, would be well played by a serious Kevin James.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and I hope Grisham continues to create new characters, new rackets, and fresh endings (in this one, the bad guys/good guys/right guys get away). Because it's fun. Can't say the same with some other so-called best selling authors who have slipped into the mire of repetitive characters, plots and endings, disguising them as fresh new fiction. At least Grisham offers something new every time. I hope he's having as much fun doing that as I am reading the end results.Because it's fun.

B005I6EU48|5.0|I recently bought a Kindle Fire as well as a leather cover for it. That leather cover, though, turned out to be a bit thicker than I wanted and the design made it uncomfortable to hold one handed for very long. Then I found this one. I showed the pictures to a few friends and they agreed that it was a really attractive cover, so I bought it.<br /><br />Now, I read in several reviews that there were problems with the cover not wanting to close all the way. Those reviews were true. I also read in some of the reviews that the way to solve that is to lay it face down for several hours after installation. Those reviews were true too! And the final bit I needed came from a couple of reviews that basically said to soften the binding by working it. I did that as well. Now, after a few days, I have a cover that closes right every time, is very attractive and helps to hide the fact that it's actually an electronic device, because, at a glance, it first appears to be a journal or memo book.<br /><br />The colors of this case are nicely done with an aged appearance, giving it an antique look and feel. My coworkers are jealous because they can't find anything similar for their iPads.<br /><br />I very much recommend this product.
B00818J504|5.0|I ran across this book a couple weeks ago while looking for information on the new Ke$ha album Warrior. It was available on a pre-order basis in both Kindle and a dead-tree version. So I ordered the Kindle version. It showed up a day ago on my Kindle and I began reading it almost immediately.<br /><br />I am probably not the target demographic for this book but I found it very inspiring and it drove home the point to never give up on your dream(s). As is often the case with \\"overnight\\" celebrities Ke$ha's fame didn't come overnight at all and she reviews how music and writing were part of her childhood and recounts the astronomical number of lyrics she wrote before recording one note, let alone becoming famous. She presents a realistic view of what it took to become that \\"overnight\\" sensation, and what \\"dues\\" were paid along the way.<br /><br />A note on the Kindle version. You need to read this on an iPad, Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD (or in the cloud reader) as it is full of color pictures. If you do read the Kindle version note that the text is miniscule and not really text at all but pictures of text. However it does becomes larger and readable in rectangular chunks if you tap twice on each area of text - or click twice in the Cloud reader. Try a sample first to see what I mean.<br /><br />Blah, blah, blah...
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Love this author but did not care for this book, seemed like it was written by someone else, not as good as his other books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the book. It was a entertaining story to finish the trilogy. Sad but good. Sad the story is over.
B000FC130E|3.0|Starts out well and ends well, but the middle leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />Gaiman has a great concept in &#34;London Above, London Below,&#34; but like Keppler notes he fails to develop it. The result is a bit thin when compared with the stellar American Gods or Anansi Boys.<br /><br />Neverwhere is worth reading if you are a Gaiman fan, but if you are new to the author try the aforementioned first.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|A warm, cozy fairy tale that feels more like a Disney production than the latest entry in Pixar's storybook. It's sweet, quirky and funny, but routinely falls back on familiar motifs and often seems criminally under-explored. Since the vast majority of the action takes place in and around a single locale, there's a claustrophobic quality in the air that never truly dissipates, which robs us of the grand scale that's been present in every one of the animation factory's preceding works. It's no more than a straightforward telling of a reasonably interesting fable, with only a few short jolts of the unique character and timely laughs I've come to expect from the troupe. Of course, there's no arguing the fact that Pixar knows how to produce gorgeous scenery, and Brave is yet another leap forward in that regard; the surrounding landscapes are unanimously breathtaking, and Princess Merida's hair is constantly bouncy and lifelike, truly a character unto itself. It's an enjoyable fresh ride and a marked improvement over the lifeless Cars 2, but misses the depth and flair that made me fall so deeply in love with the studio's classics.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|This is a fairly predictable fantasy/adventure movie with good special effects and some interesting scenes of naval vessels. You will definitely want to check your mind at the door before starting to watch it if you intend to enjoy all of the action and a lot of the action is well done.<br /><br />The opening section is a little tiresome as the flaws of the main character are defined but later, after several massive leaps of unlikely developments, the movie tightens up a bit and things begin to happen. Again I will caution the reader that your ability to go with the flow and accept the premises of the movie is vital to its enjoyment.<br /><br />The almost constant thumping music background was a bit tiresome but if you have the ability to tune it out or enjoy that kind of music it may not bother you too much.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the most recent movie in the Transformer franchise you'll probably enjoy this one too. I was curious to see it but now that I have I'll probably not watch it again.

B0086DBE62|3.0|Here we have yet another version of the classic children's tale of Snow White. I don't have a clue why there have been such a remarkable number of movies about Snow White recently.<br /><br />There were some funny moments in the movie but they didn't completely compensate for the greater abundance of ordinary moments. There were also some new and clever plot twists that caught me by surprise but not enough to make me want to watch this particular rendition of Snow White again.<br /><br />The real focus of the movie is the evil stepmother who is played by Julia Roberts; Snow White, played by Lilly Collins attempts to regain her throne and restore the kingdom which had suffered under the evil queen. Some of the most creative moments involved the seven dwarfs and their income producing activities. The special effects were all satisfactory and made their contribution to the progress of the story.<br /><br />This movie should be non-threatening to most children and is rated PG. I will probably not watch it again.

0385523912|5.0|This is an extraordinary book, nonfiction that reads like a novel, a study of a handful of defectors from North Korea whose intertwined experiences present a compelling picture of life among the less-privileged classes (which is almost everyone) in the Kims' workers paradise.  Ms. Demick has a novelist's eye and, fortunately, a gift for understatement; this is a book in which several people sit by helplessly while their loved ones literally starve to death.  May all three of the Kims, including the new one if he doesn't get off his overfed ass and start to make things right, roast in whatever hell is handiest for what they've done to the helpless and innocent among the millions of people they've misgoverned.  I came away from the book enraged at the North Korean power structure but awestruck by the strength of character, the initiative, and the seer courage of the survivors whose accounts Ms. Demick presents.  This joins Leslie Chang's \\"Factory Girls\\" on my shelf of first-rate, up-close studies of poor, everyday Asian people coping with the difficult lives they've been assigned--and, sometimes, transcending them.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I liked it very much. It leaves many openings for future movies. Robert Downey Jr is perfect person to play Stark.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|After reading the first one, I was hooked enough to want to read the second one.  Eva and Gideon are picking up where they left off.  Both have a violent past of sexual abuse, and the story is based upon two broken people trying to rise above their pasts and find a healthy and fulfilling relationship.  The sex scenes are pretty hot and not overwhelming (as in, they don't appear on every other page).  The two are in therapy together and doing their best to forge a relationship based upon something besides sex, though the sex is, of course, mind blowing.  About halfway through, Gideon distances himself from Eva and begins spending his time with his ex-fiance Corinne.  It destroys Eva and the only explanation that she can get out of him is \\"Trust me.\\"  When you find out why he did this in the end, it is dramatic and delicious at the same time.<br /><br />What I like about this story that is not in 50 Shades of Gray is that Eva, the female lead, has as much of a past and is running from the same demons that Gideon is.  She is a stronger character and could stand on her own, without Gideon.  Ana Steele's character, the female lead in 50 Shades of Gray, is developed entirely in terms of Christian Gray.  It seems unfair to continually compare the Crossfire series to the 50 Shades series, but there are just too many similarities to not draw the comparison.  If you have read 50 Shades, your mind will automatically be drawn back to it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty solid series, good writing, intriguing characters and a good story.  I'll definitely come back for the third installment.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This story travels along fast and unravels in unexpected ways.  Every time I read a John Grisham story I can't put it down until I'm done.  This one, even though it was all fiction, it was just as entertaining.  I like the way the character Malcolm was developed throughout the book and how we don't really find out how smart he is until the end.

B008SVS0K0|3.0|I understand this album is getting rave reviews, and that's all well and good. I am glad most everyone likes it. I, however, am not a fan of the tone change. The band may be developing a deeper and more mature sound, but at the same time they are leaving behind what initially attracted me to them - a unique and rousing punk energy that in short supply these days, at least on the outskirts of the main stream.
B00622BF40|4.0|This is a tongue-in-cheek cinderella story which contains one of the loveliest dance sequences I can remember.  Anytime the two stars are on screen dancing together the film more than holds your interest. One has to wade through a ditzy plot to get to them but they are worth it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham is always a good, fast read. I didn't care as much for this one, though, because it was too far-fetched. Don't spend full price for it...either borrow it from a friend or go to the library.

0143116177|5.0|This is a fascinating book about money and the history of its management. By following the financial history, Ferguson is portraying human history. Everything is dictated by money -- conquests and wars to politics and policy to welfare. The book takes you on a journey from the origins of money to today's extremely complicated financial instruments. Bubbles and busts are nothing new and have happened throughout history. The causes are examined by the author in a way as to not lose the lay person. You will to get to know why stocks are so liquid and why bond markets have far reaching influence on everyone. You will understand the difference between inflation and hyperinflation, and the reasons for currency pegs and monetary expansion. People, like the Rothschilds and Soros, who understood the workings have not only risen to the top of the society but also shaped policy. Large-scale trade between the west and China in the 19th century involving selling opium produced in India resulted in wars in the name of free trade. It is yet to be seen as to what the 21st century financial relationship between the West and China, Chimerica, will result in.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed reading this book and will be part of my library. My next step is to explore other works of this author.

B006H5120E|5.0|The movie was as good as the original movie, however 3D made it pretty realistic. Instead of seeing the movie, it felt like i was living it. However the outside of the screen effects where more limited then i hoped. there are several parts where 3D out of the screen would have been a huge add and wow factor. they do add some good 3d out of screen spots, but not many. Overall the 3D effects where a huge plus for me.

B007EE4XKI|5.0|This is the first book of a three part series that will bring about the new Next Generation. The return of Data, the death of a senior officer, and Picard thinking about retirement are just a few of the major events in book one. After all the action and surprises from book one, I'm counting the days until book two is released. If you're a TNG fan this book and series is a must read.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Slow to start,hang in there, but heart racing to the end!Waiting to see the movie . Hope it lives up to the book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was astounded by the first book, but the second swept me away in it's gripping pages of insane misfortune. The terrifing story seems to revel in making your stomach and heart ache. The genius Susanne Collins has one of those gifts ,the rare kind, where you cry and scream if something doesn't go your way. The story itself was a spider web of tales and misfortunes coming together to form a truly depressing but astoudingly brilliant story  the times of light and happiness that we see in the book are sacred and we must cling to them. The dictionary defines depression as a hollow place I define it as Catching fire. Now this review may be harsh or maybe make you not want to read the book please don't do something that idiotic. I did not believe that Susanne Collins could top The Hunger Games I may have been the most mistaken person in the world. Not only did she top it she put a cherry on top. Susanne Collins how you have so much writing talent I will never know, I do know however that The Hunger Games triology has altered my entire outlook on life. Thank you
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|If you've liked her past few albums, she won't disappoint you with this one. She is a very versatile artist and she gives Pop/R&B/a little Alternative/a little Techno-ish variety on this one. Rihanna isn't a progressive artist, so I am not looking for her to have a progressive album. If you want that, I suggest you look at another artist, lol! This album is fun and it is similar to the new direction of music that she has been putting out. I like it and I say try it for yourself!!
B009DKCBM8|5.0|The music of Pill is phenomenal and the very best from NY and CH in a long long time and longingly awaited.  I won't review the songs here, other than to say that they are well written and performed.  Don't let the length of some of the songs deter you because despite their recorded length they are the best tracks and only one word comes to mind to describe - EPIC.<br /><br />As to the Blu ray, I do have some trouble with my LG player actually playing it due to a disc error.  But, wiping the disc down and the center hole usually insures playability.  Once the disc is recognized it plays without error and the audio is fantastic - Linear PCM stereo 24 bit 192 kHz stereo.  All 8 songs sound fantastic and are accompanied by video clips.  The clips are interesting as they shift from what appears to be old time video footage to cool kaleidoscope effects during the solo breaks.  My favorite video accompanies \\"She's Always Dancing\\", it must be seen to be believed.  If those are really women from the 50's then build me a time machine and order me a mail order girl.<br /><br />The 3 bonus tracks include 2 alternate mixes of the title track and the 37 minute \\"Horse Back\\" album length song that was available as a stream from Neil's site back in Jan 2012.  It includes some cool jams and about halfway through the boys play a decent version of \\"Cortez the Killer\\".  The video takes you on a tour of every nook and cranny of the recording studio.<br /><br />I didn't find any Easter eggs, but I am horrible at looking and give up quickly.<br /><br />I am enjoying the music and the videos, but highly recommend the music as it is the best from NY and CH since \\"Ragged Glory\\".  Enjoy!<br /><br />Update 11/30/12 - I found out more info about the video clips for the She's Always Dancing video.  The clips are really from the 40's and are public domain.  The first clip is called Male Order and is similar in theme to Neil's song Samole and Hold.  The next clip is called At Your Service.  You can watch the original videos at Gags and Gals.n watch the original videos at Gags and Gals.

B009AMALGM|2.0|Very weak entry it seems like the series is starting to wind up on the quality like all horror movies are doing now.<br />paranormal activity 1 and 2 were by far my favorites the third one was ok not as scary but still held its own<br />this one is a very teen based film which is by far not always a bad thing but the roles i didn't feel the need to care about and the boyfriend role was annoying<br />and i heard a fifth entry will be coming out... no comment but i hope it's better than this one!
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I found myself enjoying the MAJORITY of the songs on this album.  Chino's voice seems well rested and has the tone and vibe of earlier albums.  I'm glad to see them put together such a great group of tracks.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|I love this movie. You can read all the serious, intellectual reviews that you want, but I just want to say how absorbed in the story I was, and how I am absolutely obsessed with the movie.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|This app is adobe photoshop.  If you have ever used photoshop express for ios and android u were prolly diappointed with how basic the app was.  This app, photoshop touch is not like that.  This app does alot of the basic photoshop tasks that the desktop version does. including using layers.  If you are a photoshop user then you know that google images is very helpful when using layers in pictures.  This app has a built in google images search and also has a built in facebook photo browser too.  The interface is pretty as well.  It looks similar to the iphoto app on the ipad except i think this app is much more professonial and has more depth than ios's iphoto app.  5 STARS!!!!!

B006JPS1OM|3.0|I played this game on my Kindle.  If you enjoy a cool storyline and finding objects you'll love this game. I on the other hand have come to love hidden object games that's more hands on. where you search through different scenes to find out where certain objects belong. These kind of games really make me feel like I'm apart of the game.
B0043X1FOK|5.0|This is a great movie for the family. Funfilled, clean comedy, action packed. My grandkids have watched this movie over & over again. They dont seem to tire of it. We all just love it. Its a wonderful movie for any age group.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I always love reading accounts of people saying they had an after life experience. This one is especially good because the author was highly trained in scientific methods and felt everything could be explained that way. It appears to be from the heart and is attempting to let all of us know there really is a heaven. Excellent!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the books,  it is really detailed in the sexual acts in the beginning but I loved the story.  Couldn't put the book down, it keeps you wondering what's going to happen next!  It's a good read!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Well written and interesting.  Enjoyed learning the meaning of flowers too.  Would recommend this book to others. You find yourself rooting for main character.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is the best of the three books.  After about half the book it finally got interesting enough for me to not want to put the book down.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Led Zeppelin at their finest. I saw them 5 times in the early 70's and have the Concert pics to prove it. This blew me away.
030758836X|3.0|Librarything kept recommending this book to me.  I put myself on the lengthy waiting list at the library and rejoiced when it turned up.  It is a well-written, fast-paced page turner, but I didn't like any of the characters much. I caught on to twists quickly and I found the ending completely unbelievable. I think I would have enjoyed this book more if I was younger and a bit more gullible. Kate Atkinson, who is one of my favorite authors, wrote a very positive blurb for the back cover. I love her writing, but disagree with her review of Gone Girl.  If you are under 30 and want a fast, suspenseful read- go for it.
B002RSU9PY|5.0|I've watched Rear Window numerous times; it's one of my all time favorite Hitchcock movies! After watching an episode of Person of Interest (S1, E11, Super), which features a homage to this film, I just had to watch Rear Window again to look for similarities. It’s a classic and timeless!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|But this book really brought it home...the vatican in the 1400s was like Hollywood today. It would make a good movie, but H'wood would never make it and if they did it would suck.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Excellent well detailed without the normal punch, but with his usual meticulous planning, it is an excellent read. Overcoming obstacles and institutions is his milleu and few do it better, great read, Michael
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I just read a post from another reviewer, asking why all the comparisons between the new Aerosmith cd and the new KISS cd.  I wondered the same thing until I read an article where Steven Tyler said something to the effect that KISS was a \\"cartoon band\\" and Paul Stanley lobbed back.  Both Aero and KISS promised a return to their classic sound for their new releases.  I'm a huge Aerosmith fan and just a passing KISS fan but because of the debate, bought the new KISS cd just to see what all the fuss was about.  I had pre-ordered the special edition of the  Aerosmith cd months ago and just picked up the KISS cd yesterday.  To lay my biases bare, I'm a an AERO fan from way back.  Saw them live in '75, '76 and '77.  I'm also not stuck in the past expecting another ROCKS.  Don't even want one.  I put Pump up with their classic releases and am one of the few fans from the 70s who also thinks Get A Grip, Nine Live and especially Just Push Play are very good (if not excellent) and horribly underrated Aerosmith cds.  I have no problem with ballads and love pop music.  I also think Aerosmith in any form are a better, more talented band than KISS.<br /><br />Having said all that, here are the facts as I see them...  Kiss's \\"Monster\\" cd blows away \\"Music From Another Dimension\\"!!!  Yes, it's compressed all to hell, but in terms of what was promised, the new KISS sounds like the follow up to \\"Love Gun\\".  Simply put, it sounds like KISS should sound and delivers solid trax in the vein of their classic era; and as promised... no ballads, no outside writers, no guests... just classic KISS.  Tyler and Perry brought on the comparisons themselves by bringing in Douglas and saying this would be a return to their classic Toys / ROCKS era sound.  Make no mistake, it is not, in any way, shape or form.  I have to agree with many of the comments on amazon that this cd does have way too many ballads but the real problem is, they aren't good ones.  I have no problem with Amazing, or What It Takes or Hole In My Soul or Fly Away From Here.  In fact, I love all those songs.  The ballads on this CD just don't measure up.  If you're gonna do 'em, then do 'em right, and more importantly, don't advertise to your long time fan base that your gonna make a return to your classic sound, only to not do anything even close.  The title track from Nine Lives, Young Lust (and Eat The Rich for that matter) are much closer to Toys In The Attic than anything on this cd.  \\"Street Jesus\\" is kind of reminiscent of \\"Rats In The Cellar\\" but otherwise, I hear nothing that reminds me of classic era Aerosmith at all.  I actually have songs on this cd I HATE!  \\"Oasis In The Night\\" (from the bonus disc) is so bad I will never play it again.  As for the main cd, \\"Freedom Fighter\\" is one of my least fav Aerosmith songs of all time and the song everyone seems to like \\"Oh Yeah\\" is the biggest Stones rip off I've ever heard. Back in the day, Aerosmith were accused of sounding too much like the Stones, and I was always put off by those comments as they were totally unfounded, but this is blatant.<br /><br />So why the three stars?  I still love Aerosmith!  I love the groove (it's still there somewhere), I love Steven's voice, Joey's drums and Brad's swagger.  I do have a handful of favorites off this cd:  \\"Another Last Goodbye\\", \\"Beautiful\\" (the only song with that soaring classic Aerosmith chorus that I was longing for), \\"Legendary Child\\", \\"Street Jesus\\", Luv XXX and yes the ballad \\"Tell Me\\" are the beginnings of a good Aerosmith cd, somewhere in between the classic era and the present.  I wanted to like \\"Out Go The Lights\\" but I don't like when Steven drops out and is replaced by the female bg vocalists.  Again, it reminds me too much of the Stones and not at all of Aerosmith.  This track has a killer groove and nothing else.  Really needed an editor.  Lover Alot is overrated IMHO.  Where are the great Aerosmith melodies?  \\"We All Fall Down\\" is not good my friends and \\"Can't Stop Lovin'You\\" (while not a bad pop song) belongs on a Carrie Underwood solo cd, not an Aerosmith cd that's for damn sure!  For all the crap people give \\"Just Push Play\\" give me \\"Jaded\\" everyday and twice on Sunday in terms of a well written song.  That melody is to die for, and there's nothing... I repeat NOTHING that strong anywhere on this cd!<br /><br />Still, it's Aerosmith and any Aerosmith is better than none at all.<br />Hopefully, we'll get a better disc next time around.  Just, please don't take another 11 years to do it!!!
B0099G3I96|5.0|This really is the best album one could imagine ND producing after all these years...and that's saying a lot. As good as Rock Steady, which is their finest moment. It is more solid from beginning to end than anything--yes, anything--they have ever done. An astonishing achievement, really.
B000I9U75G|1.0|This is big G on hollywood.  Its not the same in any sense of the the classic G movies.  Im actually glad he looks like a deformed T-rex/iguana, it makes it that much easier to dismiss this as a GODZILLA movie.  Its entertaining on a Jurassic park level, but this is no GODZILLA movie in the slightest.
B007OAAK0O|4.0|In this video the concert in New York's Central Park was scheduled for a Thursday evening in the summer of 1983. The concert began in clear weather and, according to radio commentary, was attended by a crowd of 800,000- said to be the largest in the history of the park. Diana Ross first appeared in a beautiful bright orange body suit that fit tightly- a leotard. She then added a cape that fluttered in the strong wind which rushed in seemingly out of nowhere and followed quickly by a heavy down pour. The thunderstorm forced the show to end. If the first day's performances actually lasted 45 minutes we have about 15 minutes only of that at the beginning of this DVD, including TV news video clips and commentary about the event. Miss Ross kept her promise to the crowd to return the next day. Friday brought bright sunshine throughout.<br /><br />Of the many concert DVDs that I own this is the one about which I can state emphatically that much of the audio is out of sync with the video. It does get better towards the end (or is it rather that I adjusted to it?) but if you've watched TV with the audio muted while you played another thing (a music CD, for example) you did that for a reason- your attention was divided. Watching this DVD will similarly divide your attention between audio and video; it is distracting.<br /><br />Considering the age of the original material that was just released on DVD the picture quality is quite impressive. Diana put on a very good show and the DVD gives us 25 chapters of it. The camera focused mostly on Miss Ross but also on the large crowd. Band and any background singers were hidden from view until the very end.<br /><br />The original two channel audio was well distributed into all seven loud speakers of my sound system even if it did not sound as crisply as DTS audio does- (I am yet to find a Shout Factory concert DVD with DTS audio). This is a concert that cries out for release as a blue-ray disk with audio flaws corrected. Here is an assignment for Eagle Rock Entertainment.assignment for Eagle Rock Entertainment.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead is a very good show. The show not only combines a great mix of action and drama but it also adds tragedy in a way that keeps you on edge.  If gripping shows are what you want than this show will cut your circulation off it has so much grip.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Purchased this product to help light the front door way for people coming in the evening. Gives off enough light to not have to fumble in the dark with keys or a tiny flashlight. Not a warm light by any stretch of the imagination, very white and staid, but all it has to do is be on for a minute or too anyway. Fairly sensitive motion detector, could sense someone walking in the street 20 feet away. It's been working lovely for a couple months now, very satisfied with this purchase.

I have read X-Men comics for over thirty years.  I have collected many, many crossovers.  And unfortunately this series started on probably the most suspenseful note and ended the most pitifully of any miniseries I have read: the crossover starts promisingly, but stumbles in the middle and falls completely flat at the end.<br /><br />This disappointing story coupled with poor binding make this a hard collection to recommend.  The binding is glued.  The center of the book makes some of the art hard to see and totally interrupts any 2-page spreads. It seems like the digital content is offered as compensation for cheap binding. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of digital comics (and I absolutely loathe Augmented Reality feature).<br /><br />Finally even the collectors out there will be put off by this collection. Rather than weaving the story into a seamless narrative, Avengers vs X-Men 0-12 and AvX 1-6 are separated.  They are not collected in their chronological order. So the first half of this graphic novel is a pretty sloppy story.  And the second half only carries as much interest as a 'Marvel vs Capcom' or Mortal Kombat series: battles are kind of interesting if you ever wondered who would win.  But also kind of disappointing in that 1) half the time the X-Men are Phoenix possessed and 2) now we *know* who wins.  I think the joy of pondering 'who would win' is the ensuing debate.  Now we know... so there is no point in debating it any longer.<br /><br />The only thing collectors should enjoy here is the print inclusion previously digital-only \\"Infinite\\" episodes.  Whatever benefit found in the inclusion of these episodes is offset by the failure to publish the AR (Augmented Reality) materials.  Transparencies bound in the appropriate pages would have served this purpose perfectly.  Instead readers must have a smart phone and the free app.  As a reader of X-Men for decades, it saddens me that tomorrow's collectors will in all likelihood forever have incomplete comics.  How long will the AR app be supported? How long will Marvel host the AR data? What if Marvel is sold (again)? What happens when technology changes?  Imagine the comic book experience if the early X-Men from 1960s required a particular brand of decoder ring or x-ray glasses to get the complete comic.<br /><br />This series only redeeming features are some good battle scenes (but there are also a lot bad ones).<br /><br />*************SPOILERS BELOW*****************<br /><br />If a story ever jumped the shark in the Marvelverse this is it.  Captain America armed with SHIELD comes to Utopia to arrest Hope: great set up for a story.  Unfortunately the dramatic tension from the beginning of this miniseries is the highpoint of this collection.  There are 3 major failings with the story.<br /><br />1. This is the worst script anyone has ever given Wolverine.  Wolverine does tortured and conflicted really well. Wolverine does loyal to a fault really well.  But in this series Wolverine seems to have limited compunctions about betraying his family. Just awful.<br /><br />2. Even if you could forgive Wolverine for becoming a school teacher, there are more fundamental problems.  We learn that the Phoenix force has origins in the beginning of the universe: at the moment of the big bang when existence and nothingness were moments apart (cool!).  We also learn that Tony Stark can spend a long weekend and improvise a device to splinter a primal universal force (sigh).<br /><br />3. A splintered Phoenix force occupies Cyclops, Emma, Namor, Colossus, and Magik. They all become absurdly pompous. And then they become Dark Phoenix evil.  Yes, I get that power corrupts and that absolute power...  (yawn).  Long story short, the Avengers arrest Cyclops.  Somehow Cyclops is more responsible for his Phoenix possessed actions than the other X-Men.  (blah).<br /><br />Sorry folks, this is a grab for young readers who aren't familiar with these characters.  It was a huge disappointment for this reader.  And insult was added to injury by the cheap binding.y all become absurdly pompous. And then they become Dark Phoenix evil.  Yes, I get that power corrupts and that absolute power...  (yawn).

0743270754|5.0|Since its publication Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography of Lincoln has rightly become regarded as a modern classic. It is an exquisitely written account of Lincoln's life from his birth in poverty in Kentucky, through a period in child slavery, to self education and success as a lawyer, politician and President during the worst constitutional crisis in US history, to his death in the Petersen boarding house in Washington DC.<br /><br />Tolstoy described Lincoln as a \\"humanitarian as broad as the world\\" and Kearns Goodwin's approach to demonstrating the truth of this judgement is to focus on the relationships between Lincoln and his cabinet ministers, particularly Seward, his Secretary of State, Stanton his Secretary of War, Chase his Treasury Secretary, and to a lesser extent Welles his Navy Secretary, Bates his Attorney General and Blair his Postmaster General. Seward, Chase, and Bates were Lincoln's principle rivals for the Republican nomination in 1860 and it was unprecedented for a President to bring such rivals into his \\"political family\\" as Lincoln did. But, such was the crisis that the nation was facing with the threat of secession from the slave states in response to the election of even a \\"moderate\\" anti-slavery candidate such as Lincoln, Lincoln felt that he had to have the most capable men for his cabinet. That some of them, particularly Chase, felt that Lincoln was an unworthy candidate and unqualified to be President added to the challenge that Lincoln faced.<br /><br />Lincoln's genius as a visionary, writer and speaker are well understood and well demonstrated in this biography. The book details his evolving thinking on the issue of slavery from a \\"moderate\\" anti-slavery position to an increasingly radical one as a result of contact the struggle itself and with the likes of Fredrick Douglass and the ordinary black soldiers who were giving their lives to defend the Union: \\"There have been men base enough to propose to me to return to slavery the black warriors of Port Hudson and Olustee, and thus win the respect of the masters they fought. Should I do so, I should deserve to be damned in time and eternity\\", he said at one stage.<br /><br />In addition Kearns Goodwin book illustrates Lincoln's managerial genius, arguing convincingly that it emerged from his enormous decency and magnanimity, and that it was fundamental in ensuring that such a disparate group acted together in the national interest in time of an unprecedented national crisis.<br /><br />Lincoln's lovely gift of humour and intense like-ability shine through the biography and consequently the devastating tragedy of his assassination still resonates down the centuries. This book is a fitting tribute to the greatest figure of the 19th century and one of the greatest figures of all world history.arriors of Port Hudson and Olustee, and thus win the respect of the masters they fought.

B009AZZEU2|5.0|First off, this album is NOT merely an exercise in nostaglia. This IS the Soundgarden that fans know and love and will remember clearly. But personally, I cannot remember a &#34;comeback&#34; that has been more welcome and justified. In a day an age when there is very little real &#34;music&#34; being made out there, Soundgarden roars back, as vital, if not more, today than they ever were. This is a much needed example and specimen of real people, writing real songs, playing real instruments, and creating something far and well beyond the stagnant &#34;product&#34; that currently passes for music. Breathtaking and brilliant, this record reminds us what it should be all about, and what it should be now. Soundgarden is dead, long live Soundgarden!

Normally I would be upset that I missed such an amazing game, but from what I understand this is the definitive version of the game and I can see why. There are many reviews, but mine will be kind of short because I will compare it's best features to other games.<br /><br />First off, the visuals look great. Like World of Warcraft, the art style keeps the game from looking dated. The fighting is turn based and if you like Final Fantasy games, you'll be right at home. The game constantly gives you decisions to make that can affect the story kind of like Mass Effect, so you will most likely want to play through again even if it take you 50 to 100 hours. The sound is exceptional. Vita cartridges are tiny and it is amazing to hear so much voice acting crammed in the game. They also have the catchiest J Pop music i have ever heard in a game. Finally, I loved Shenmue on the Dreamcast and have wanted a remake for the longest. This game has many of the elements I loved. You get to explore the city and shops, get part time jobs, there is a lot of social interaction, and there is active time, date, and weather.<br /><br />Bottom line, get this game! If JRPG's like Final Fantasy were still mainstream in the U.S., this would be a Vita seller for sure. It is quite possibly the best RPG I have ever played, but I haven't gotten all the way through to make that decision. It's just incredible!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great cover.  This is how I remember Avatar from the big screen.  This is where I got hooked on 3d.<br /><br />Thank you
B004LWZW24|2.0|I wanted to like it, being a fan of Saw, but no go. This was bad Hollywood horror filmmaking. Just endless scenes, took itself too seriously. and not enough scares by a long shot.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works fine for me. Its nice to know how much battery I have. This gives you an idea of how many more hours you have doing many different activities. Useful app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|worth the free price.  I got this app while I was in a hurry &amp; 3 months later I'm still using it on daily basis.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is so much fun and easy to play hour's on end.  the cards are very readable - no strain on your eyes.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|it is made good and the handles are good. It survived 6 weeks in the most brutal conditions and came out good as new. the blade holds an edge very well and the knife as a hole will serve you well.
B006H5120E|1.0|It does not play on my LG 3D Blue Ray Player.  It tells me that the disc (all four discs) is not compattable with this player.  The player is three months old.  All the other discs that i have plays fine.  Is there anything that i can do to rectify this?
B000T5O48U|5.0|Great 25th Anniversary edition for a pretty good horror flick. One of the better King horrors. Great scary stuff and the dog should definitely have had an Oscar.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Awsome game lots of armors you have to put alot of time into it to get better armor and stuff
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love this ap.  I like that they can actually play each other on their seperate kindles.  My son is 13 and my daughter is 10, so they hardly ever play together.  They are usually arguing over something silly.  This game brings them together. Makes for much nicer car rides.  I also enjoy the fact that they have to think a little to play.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is an excellent quality movie and everyone should purchase!! It arrived promptly and in excellent condition and we are all enjoying this wonderful movie!!
B004UID2LC|3.0|its like a regular youtube but it gets frozen and you cant get out of it and when you play music it dosent play
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I especially enjoyed the duet with Donny Osmond, \\"This Is the Moment\\"---very fine!<br /><br />--And \\"Music of the Night\\" with Michael Crawford--Outstanding.<br />He must have sung the song hundreds and hundreds of times, but I think this is the best. His voice is deeper and richer, and the duet is s.e.n.s.u.a.l!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson's Stormlight Archive is easily one of the most engaging new fantasy series.  I've always been a big fan of series that don't spend overly much time explaining things, and that is definitely the case with this.  You pick things up as you read through the novel.  Don't be intimidated by the sheer mass of things (rockbuds? what the heck is a rockbud? etc.) that you will encounter. Sanderson provides exactly enough explanation so the reader is capable of building the world in his own mind.<br /><br />One of the very best things about this book is that, while I expect the series to be fairly long, I still felt like the book actually resolved itself.  Obviously many questions are left unanswered, but there is enough material in the book to inspire TONS of discussion about the possible impact of certain events or revelations, and about what will happen to certain characters, but as a single volume it is still very well its own story.<br /><br />All in all, I would highly recommend this book (and have done so to all of my friends).
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I came across this show a little bit ago. I wasn't sure if it would be worth watching. I mean there are a ton of Sherlock inspired shows(House, Bones, etc) But I really like it. Johnny Lee Miller does an excellent job without coming off as too much. I wasn't sure about a female Watson (Lucy Liu) but i think it works and makes the shows dynamic better. I'd say if you were thinking about it give it a chance, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|1.0|the apple and all other possiple versions have<br />.5 my friend hacked his kindle fire by accident and got it. until we get. 5 I will never rate this. 5
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have been playng for a couple weeks ... its a cute and fun game! grt to pass the time
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have not been through all the DVD's in this set as of yet. I see one or two several times to get the history, then compare to other historical documents and old VHS tapes on the particular subject matter I am researching. As for what I have seen thus far, this is exceptional information. I do recommend to any, who want to get a close view of events and even documented motives of those who would lead such encounters. This is so far a very accurate work, my hat is off to the editors and film crew of this study, from my perspective.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I've had so many friends tell me that if I like this genre, the this was a must read.  Honestly, I want to kick myself to taking so long to finally read this book.  Great book! Excellent read, never lost interest as I normally do when reading a book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!  Every time I was doing something else, I wished I was reading instead.  So many great twists throughout the entire thing and I loved how the story alternated between Nick and Amy's viewpoints.  I had initially downloaded the sample to my kindle, read a few pages, then decided it was a little too dark for me to read on my honeymoon since it opens with a fairly new married couple who are obviously not doing well in their relationship.  However, a few weeks later a friend of mine told me she thought I would really like it so I decided to read on further.  She was right.  Fantastic twists, great format for the story, wonderful writing.  Such a great book.
B000L3CHC0|3.0|I really liked the watch, and but the band was too small for my wrist. I wish that a larger band, and or at least extensions, we're available.
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this movie.  The story just kept me on the edge of my seat.  I cant wait to watch Part 2.
B00A77II0U|5.0|keeps you engaged with various mini-games and clue finding. great graphics. not just your average hidden object game.  great game for the Halloween season.
B009NOVCTM|2.0|Time for The Stones to hang it up. Grrr! is yet ANOTHER hits package of songs any true Stones fan already has. Do they really need the money ? Speaking of that, their shows in Newark are priced form $160 to $600. If this doesn't let the fans know they're in it for the money, what does? They have become a parody of themselves and should have retired in style years ago at the top of their game. Thanks for the memories.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I hate this it wont download this is so stupid dont waste ur money on it<br />I cant beloved this happened don't get it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like it but the kids love it. it is hard at times but it it was two easy then it would not be as fun.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Lots of cute fun. Great for any age and gender. Very addictive. Only downside is the cost on purchasing coins and points, but still fun.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I was reading the negative reviews & was surprised to see people saying this is a scary movie with no story line... I loved this movie for the fact that it shows my 3 year old she doesn't need to be a perfect girl to be a princess. I absolutely loved the rough around the edges approach Disney & Pixar took with this. I'm by no means a violent person, but the \\"violence\\" that was depicted in the film was kid-friendly enough. My 3 year old hasn't shown any interest in becoming a killer of bears or anything unusual. To note- we live by a plant-based diet & definitely don't recommend the unnecessary killing of animals. I also liked that there was a real relationship depicted between Merida & her mother. It's not always an agreeable & happy time in real families & this showed how, while much more magical, there are always issues between family members because they are different personalities. I also appreciated that she was in the stable taking care of her horse showing that, while she's a princess, she still has responsibilities to tend to. I highly recommend this movie:)
B00992CF6W|5.0|bye minecraft because there is great blokes like Tnt cobblestone sand dirt flowers mushrooms shuffles pickaxes axes grass pictures portles
0547884591|1.0|I quite liked \\"The Four Hour Work Week\\" and was intrigued by the idea of this book. Unfortunately, the book is just a collection of random thoughts about kickboxing, tango, chess, science etc. Tim Ferris knows a little about each one of these topics, but his knowledge seems to be very superficial. I can only judge one topic (I have a PhD in slavic linguistics) and Mr. Ferriss is just plain wrong one many of his theories, derived mainly from his personal experience only. Why does Tim want to write about each one of these topics? Why not be an editor and use multiple authors to talk about what they know best?<br /><br />And why does he feel the need to fake the ratings for his book? Over 50 five star reviews pop up the same day the book is published, almost at the same time, by reviewers who didn't review any other book.
B009E3EY38|5.0|What can I say! This was simply something to watch and take in and then watch again! Celebration Day is a fitting end for a band and its music that will forever be timeless for so many of us. Standouts for me were GTBT, Ramble On, and in my mind the best live version of Kashmir. All four members turn in a great performance and this blows the previous Zep reunions and even the Plant Page collboration away by miles. Hats off to whoever filmed and recorded this wonderful concert. I doubt we will see them together again but just watch this over and over and its easy to understand why Led Zeppelin will be loved for generations well past my time. Jason your father would be so proud of you. Jonesy you are the ultimate all around complete muscian. Percy you may not have your high range anymore but in many ways your timeless voice still conveys the emotion and passion that so many continie to emulate. Finally, Pagey your mantra riffs and fingerprint guitar solos forever make you the ultimate guitar player. Ahmet, they did do it and somewhere you, Bonzo, and Peter must be very proud. I know I am! :)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I really think this is a great game! I keep asking my mom to download it. I just googled it and sounds great!!!
0547884591|5.0|One of the best books I have bought in a long time. 4-Hour Chef is about more than just cooking. Primarily, it's about learning and creating roadmaps for learning anything. It is full of good information, and it is the one cookbook where you need to read every page to get the most out of it.<br /><br />It is huge, but the most important lessons are deceptively simple. The real meat is in the introduction and the first section. Here you will find a goldmine of information, easily worth the price of the book by itself. Below are some of the things I have enjoyed most so far:<br /><br />* One page cooking cheat sheet. Excellent example of condensing complex info to one page, most bang for the buck. Also see the four hour body summary.<br /><br />* Meta-learning section is very good.<br /><br />* How to shoot a three pointer appendix is great. I play basketball at least 4-5 hours a week and have done so for 15 years. Reading this section improved my shot instantly, and working on the form here has continued to improve my game. Great, concise example of conveying complex information in readable, learnable format.<br /><br />* The memory, or encoding section, is good but would have liked to see some other book recommendations. Memory is one of my favorite subjects and a five page treatment just barely scratches the surface. Below are some other book recommendations for memory if you want to learn other methods.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1569246297 Your Memory : How It Works and How to Improve It]] - Practical and theoretical, a good starting point.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345304233 The Memory Book]] - Practical only, but excellent introduction.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004Q9JQGA Moonwalking with Einstein]] - Excellent memoir, first got me interested in memory. If you aren't sure if you want to commit the time to use your memory effectively, read this first.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1933184175 Memorize the Faith! (and Most Anything Else): Using the Methods of the Great Catholic Medieval Memory Masters]] - Very practical, great instruction on using the loci method.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1118275195 Train Your Brain For Success: Read Smarter, Remember More, and Break Your Own Records]] - Some unique memory methods here that I have not found elsewhere. Great information, especially body-loci method.<br /><br />Bottom line: Buy this book. To paraphrase Ryan Holiday, \\"If you don't have copy of this book, you are an idiot.\\"<br /><br />PS - To address all of the noise on the reviews about five star ratings and how soon they came out . . . if you complained about this, you don't know how the book industry works. I own a small publishing company. It is standard practice to give early copies to those who you believe will offer positive reviews. After all, they are your fans or interested in the book in some way or they wouldn't receive a copy. When Amazon allows reviews for any product, everything is fair game. Many have a review written but don't post it until Amazon allows it. There is nothing strange about getting multiple five star reviews the day a book comes out. . . . in fact, if an author has done their job, its what should happen.<br /><br />* 11/20/2012<br /><br />First Impressions: This book looks great. If you like books, do yourself a favor and pick this up. It's a great design and Tim Ferris and his publisher did not pull any punches. It's a great looking book.<br /><br />After flipping through the book and reading a few sections, I am excited to read this book and learn how to cook. The method may not be for everyone, but the layout of this book is perfect for me. Can't wait to get started and work my way through it. The bonus sections are just as interesting to me as well, and the learning method that is explained in the first section is the real gold in the book for me.<br /><br />Two other things to note:<br />One, the size of this book is daunting. It's huge, complicated looking, and full of information. Take your time and read the Table of Contents - youwill see that it is carefully organized and laid out to be the most helpful, even though it is massive.<br /><br />Second, my wife opened before I did and looked through it. Her impression is \\"That's a man's cookbook, I would never use it.\\" Probably a lot of truth in that.will see that it is carefully organized and laid out to be the most helpful, even though it is massive.<br /><br />Second, my wife opened before I did and looked through it.

0345803485|4.0|Note to self: Must buy new tie for hubby for Christmas...<br /><br />The girlish response to Mr. Grey is very appropriate given her experience.  Thank goodness there is two more books...at least we can exploit this relationship.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|its taken hours to download its still not done!I don't know if its my Internet,because its known to be crapy at times, its 21% downloaded and wont go any further. and the worst thing is,I cant stop it! would not refer this app to any one!
0671027344|4.0|This book spoke to me through my high school years. Though it's been a bit of time, Stephen Chbosky captures the nuances of adolescence through Charlie. He is me. Maybe he's all of us. Or, at least part of all of us. Charlie is intentionally set up as a more modern--and maybe more confusedly wayward--Holden Caulfield. Young and bright, but disenchanted by those around him. The ones he can see right through. Then he meets the right people, falls into an unrequited love, and life just goes.<br /><br />It invokes the early 90s. Music and literature and learning. It's all here. There is a bit of melodrama, maybe some stereotypes, but isn't that what growing up entails? Isn't that real life? His problems and troubles may not be mine, but we all have them, we all have something that pushes us against the wall or away from it.<br /><br />It's a quick read and it's worth it. Either you're in it now, you will be, or you were. Remember those that are different and those you weren't quite sure about. Everyone has a story.<br /><br />--- ---<br /><br />\\"we accept the love we think we deserve\\" [the \\"famous\\" line] (24)<br /><br />\\"Zen is a day like this when you are part of the air and remember things\\" (43)<br /><br />\\"I look at the field, and I think about the boy who just made the touchdown. I think that these are the glory days for that boy, and this moment will just be another story someday because all the people who make touchdowns and home runs will become somebody's dad. And when his children look at his yearbook photograph, they will think that their dad was rugged and handsome and looked a lot happier that they are.\\" (53)<br /><br />\\"every person has to live for his or her own life and then make the choice to share it with other people\\" (169)<br /><br />\\"I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.\\" (211)

B000N2HBSO|5.0|Received this just before the current Presidential election.<br />How uncanny history is at repeating it's self. Then it was the Whigs who became Republicans.<br />Problems then are the same today, and they weren't fixed then either.<br />A really good book that makes you feel you are right there at the time it is written.<br />History buffs will enjoy this, just as the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; is showing in theaters.<br />Lincoln was a special man and this book helps explain what a great man he was.<br />Enjoy this interesting book on our history, I did.
0345803507|4.0|Not the best written book, kinda tired of the same old vanilla, but none-the-less; I can't put this thing down until I am done!
B0086700CM|5.0|It's a great game. It's addictive, challenging, and fun. I definetly recommend it! It's good not only for young teenagers but also for adults.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I am soooooo disapointed in this book. I started reading it, got so bored with it I read another book instead.<br />Picked it up again and just can't get into it. It does not read like a John Grisham book. I don't know what happened to him. It's like bla bla bla. bla bla bla. I couldn't wait to get it done so I could delete it from my kindle. Really disapointed in this book. Really.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I cannot say that there is a Sophie Kinsella book that I don't love!  I relate to the characters, laugh out loud and find them impossible to put down!  This book was no different!  I loved everything about it!  My only gripe is I wish she would write faster!  I cannot wait for her next books to be published so that I can love them too!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|good game and decent mystery, not very scary. only glitched up on me once. it wouldn't acknowledge my tapping of an item.
0345803485|2.0|Typically I am not into hype especially with books until my friends started calling and raving about this great book. Being an avid reader who is particular about how she spends her money for books, given that is my addiction, I refused to be sucked in and searched for where I could borrow. Scheduled for an overseas trip and a long flight I decided that I should purchase one paper back along with my Kindle if the battery on my kindle fails me. UNFORTUNATELY, I ended up buying this book.<br />Seriously, what is the hype about? This is just a plain BDSM erotica book, and you can get even juicier ones for way cheaper price. I may have enjoyed it like any other erotica if it wasn't so plain using the author's words for description \\"Vanilla\\".
0345803493|4.0|The only reason I bought this book was because I couldn't put the first one down.  Now after reading this one, I want to finish the trilogy.  I am not an avid reader, but this book has brought me back to the reading scene.  I am half done with book 3 and not really sure what I want to read after this, but I need to find something...<br /><br />And I bet whatever movie they try to create from this will be just as trashy, but a must see anyway ;)  Besides, we all need a night out with the girls.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Challenging Angry Birds game that has you flying in orbit trying to get the pigs.  Gauge your orbit just right or you'll just orbit in circles right off your mark.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My son told me about this book, so I ordered it to my kindle. I could not put this book down.<br />I spent the whole day on the couch till I finished it. I hear Jeff Bridges is going to play one<br />of the characters in the book. Reading the book first will really help you follow the movie so much<br />more. I can't say enough about this book. GOOD READ.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|... and I'm not talking actors.  I loved the movie to begin with- it's one of the few I've seen multiple times.  I think it is the most epic Romantic period piece ever, and it is fairly closely based on a true story, which makes it even more awesome.  I really enjoyed all the special features on the disc, and legitimately learned some new things.  For me, the extras are reason enough to purchase this.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|After enjoying the Shadow of the Wind so much, I chose another book by Ruiz Zafon and was not disappointed.<br />Beautiful writing and excellent translation. Probably not as enjoyable for those who have not read the first book,<br />but still fascinating.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Just really started to use this, even though I have had it a while.  I just got and update for it yesterday.  I really like them and started to use it as a diary.  I think it is going to be great to put down in writing things in my life right at the moment they happen since I will have it with me every day.  I wont miss writing down those things I might forget to write down later.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is my new favorite. It's really a logic puzzle that gets more complex as you go along. If you're looking for an action game, this isn't it. But if you want to have fun exercising some brain cells, I recommend Trainyard.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|This latest edition of Angry Birds is different, but in a good way.  Your birds have light-sabers that can cut through just about anything and slow-motion birds which slow down at first then break just about any barrier.  Then you have birds that also shoot laser blasts-  but be aware as the pigs have laser blasts of their own.  It's definately a challenging game even at the beginning stages- at least until you get the hang of it.
B00000J2PH|5.0|No idea if it's the best, and all the best; but this works for me, in my simple collection.<br /><br />She really is someone to enjoy.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book! From the very beginning I was intrigued by the main character and wanted to know what happened or should I say what choices she made each day. I liked this strong willed young girl and how she had her principals although you don't know where they were formed. I loved the &#34;language of flowers&#34; as people came to her as someone to help them in their life. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to get lost in a great read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This allows me to not only keep track of some favorite sites, but to keep photos that jog my memory on some really cool ideas they gave me without having to page through multiple sites before finding what I want.  I can also just keep a link of a photo, whether for an idea or appreciating the photo itself.  I have found many things browsing other members links as well as getting to pin my own favorite web pages.
B003WUYP56|5.0|Everyone who cares about science, education and the future of our country should read this book. Dr. Smolin explains in very lucid terms the fundamental questions remaining to be answered in foundational physics and gives an equally articulate overview of recent theories.  The last section of the book gives an honest and courageous analysis of the pervasive culture in academia that no longer nurtures the most able and creative members of our species. While this has had profound effects on progress in physics, it is by no means limited to this discipline.  Squelching the creativity of the gifted child all too often and sadly starts in preschool and doesn't improve as the years go by.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|\\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Set on an island off the coast of New England in the 1960s, as a young boy and girl fall in love they are moved to run away together. Various factions of the town mobilize to search for them and the town is turned upside down -- which might not be such a bad thing.<br /><br />The cast led by Bruce Willis (as Captain Sharp), Edward Norton (as Scout Master Randall Ward), Bill Murray (as Walt Bishop), Frances McDormand (as Laura Bishop), Tilda Swinton (as Social Services), Jared Gilman (as Sam), Kara Hayward (as Suzy), Jason Schwartzman (as Cousin Ben) & Bob Balaban (as The Narrator) is brilliant. The directing by Wes Anderson (who also wrote the story & screenplay & produced the film, as well) is brilliant. The story & screenplay by Anderson & Roman Coppola is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Alexandre Desplat is brilliant. The cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is brilliant. The film editing by Andrew Weisblum is brilliant. The casting by Douglas Aibel is brilliant. The production design by Adam Stockhausen is brilliant. The art direction by Gerald Sullivan is brilliant. The set decoration by Kris Moran, set dressings by Shadya H. Ballug, Steve Brennan, Jason Case, Jessica Case, Jared Hartley, Kevin C. Lang, Erik Malkovich, Brian McKenzie, Nancy A. Pavia & John Ryder, set designs by Jeremy Woodward is brilliant. The costume design by Kasia Walicka-Maimone is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by John Ruggieri is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Dan Schrecker & Gene Warren III is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Paul Marini is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a terrific film that is well-made and well-done (as well as well-crafted). Wes Anderson has made one of his best movies of his career, if not, his best movie yet. This is also a film that has a terrific cast of stars that will keep you entertained. This is also one of the best films of the year and sure be remembered come Oscar season.
B005HV6YO8|1.0|This is not the 4 CD or 5 CD set! It's complete BS and Amazon will not accept returns! DECEPTIVE!<br /><br />How do you get 25 years of Sting in only 7 songs on a CD? You advertise it next to the box set, so us idiots would even buy the damn thing!<br /><br />I didn't even open it! I have it for sale, unopened, on eBay! So, go there to buy it, if you really want such a thing!<br /><br /> Even a 5 CD set is no good overview of Sting, and mostly The Police! But 5 CD's would be a good start.

1609611543|2.0|Despite the title, \\"Wheat Belly,\\" the book actually advocates the low glycemic index diet that is already well established and well-researched in many other books. Chapter after chapter is filled with research villainizing wheat, although you can't help but notice little statements that hedge the bet about how other carbohydrates are \\"almost\\" or \\"just\\" as bad, and warnings that substitutions don't actually help. Then the actual diet eliminates not just wheat, but wheat, sugar, corn, most fruits, condiments, substitute flours and restricts potatoes and rice.<br /><br />While the health benefits of this diet are well documented, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended) to take aim at one product because it sounds new and revolutionary (and relatively simple), but then tell you at the end that the health benefit requires a much different approach. And one that isn't new at all.
B009DT98RK|5.0|This is a very good Blu-ray! Both visually and sound it's spot on.<br />It was nice to see him reunite with his favorite 1954 black Les Paul classic<br />after 32 years. This guitar was a gift from Humble Pie days played exclusively Rock On and Rocking the Fillmore albums.<br />The only thing Frampton has lost is his hair! lol<br />His band is top notch with a great drummer.<br />There is a reason why Frampton would make any list of  the top 150 guitarists.<br />The only offputting thing about this BR is the cheesy cardboard jewell case.<br />That and the person who rated it as a 2 because there was only one disk in a 2 part DVD.<br />Honestly what has that got to do with the performance.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|it arrived yay! I have an itunes purchase on my ipod and finally the cd - disc was beautiful - awesome artwork and poster.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I don't know what I expected in a movie about one of our most beloved Presidents who happens to be a vampire hunter, but this was a pleasant surprise. It was a history lesson with a twist. Watching \\"Abraham Hunter: Vampire Hunter\\" was like seeing \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\" for the first time......a fascinating movie that was totally unexpected but greatly appreciated. I loved the way the writers wove bits of history (i.e., slavery, the death of his son, and the Civil War) with a possible premise that included slavery being beneficial for not only Southerners, but for vampires, seeing that they were using them for food. The movie literally shows the evolution of Abraham Lincoln from a young boy bent on revenge (vampires killed his mother) to a young man with political aspirations, into a man fighting to end slavery for several reasons, but none more important than preventing vampires for taking over the world. (Apparently slavery allows the vamps to feed without regard for the consequences). Regardless, as Lincoln's political career culminates in a presidency, we see Lincoln facing everything from the death of his son (again history with a twist) to betrayal by a friend. I definitely recommend this movie for those who love action, decent acting, great special effects and a movie soaked in history. After all, what could be better than an \\"ax\\" wielding President?
B003U6BE8I|5.0|[[ASIN:B003HARV3Y Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief]] I have watched this one a few times and still is not<br />boring. the younger generation and some of us older folks should be enjoying this movie.the magi affects and actors are wonderfull

B009CPRYG2|5.0|The voice talent, peter weller, was sufficient.  The movie was straight from the graphic novel.  It did it justice. If you like your comicbook movies without a re-do to a significant plot point...then this is it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is my new favorite book. John Green is an amazingly talented writer, and this book proves it. There are so many memorable lines in this book, and the characters are amazing. This book made me laugh, cry, and want to read it again.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Even though this is a fantasy novel, the element of &#34;magic&#34; is sprinkled teasingly thin. The effect is one that makes you feel as if this may be historical fiction. The reality of the political workings of war and jockeying for power are not sugar coated in the least. It does no good to root for a character in this story, because they are just as subject to a brutal end as those you deem the villain. For that reason, I enjoyed the book immensely. My curiosity at which way the story was going to turn was piqued often. My only dislike was that some of the scenes were so graphic that I could not shake them from my conscious for a few days.  Not for the squeamish.

B000002OTL|5.0|Most of my reviews have discussed either books, movies (DVDs) or products. This will be my first review of a movie soundtrack CD. And boy what a doozie it is!<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that this movie is a fantastic movie. However, in my opinion for a movie to be great, it must also have great music. Either incidental music or thematic music or music from multiple genres creating a great overall soundtrack. That is what occurred here. I bought this CD back in 1995, right after I'd seen the movie in the theatres, and I can tell you I was dazzled by the storyline as well as the music. For the CD, everything has been formatted perfectly.<br /><br />Buy this CD and you will not be disappointed. My favorite scene stealer comes from: \\"Bring out the gimp.\\" \\"But the gimp's sleeping,\\" a man says. \\"Well I'll guess you'll have to wake him up now won't you?\\" Small snippetts from scenes in the movie add to the richness of the CD, as well as exhibit interest to any fellow unlucky enough to have not seen the film. Ironically, the song that was originally intended for the scene (I Forget What Song It Was) was nixed because the songwriter did not like the subject matter of the scene. Too bad, had he agreed, his song would have found new life and been immortalized forever. I'm review #88 for this CD.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the Worlds was really good.  It's too bad we have to wait another year for the third and final installment.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I can't believe they actually got it right?  The plot was decent.  The cast was well suited for the movie, but I would suggest seeing Thor, Iron Man 1 and 2 (although I don't like 2), the Capt America movie and Hulk before you see this as it just allows you to fully appreciate the buildup to as why you should be fully embracing this movie.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|it was not up to john Grisham's writing.  Did not make me not want to put it down.  He can do much better

B009P5S11G|5.0|With its blend of Modern R&B/Pop beats and mature lyrics, Unapologetic has me simply blown away!  I've been a fan of Rihanna's since she first hit the scene in 2005 and with each album there is growth and improvement with each one.  I'll say Unapologetic is as close to being my favorite Ri Ri album since Good Girl Gone Bad -- mainly because it has a more of an R&B vibe than her last few albums.<br /><br />She and Chris Brown, are incredible paying homage to one Michael Jackson 'Nobody's Business' as it pertains to their on-and-off-again rocky relationship.  Chris Brown really does a good job with the notes on the tracks.  'Fresh Off The Runaway' is Rihanna simply showing off here, this track is really street aiming at her vanity and success all in swoop and the same can be said for 'Pour It Up' as she gets on her Soulja Boy level.  'Get It Over With' is  a song I could play over and over again without question, it's so mellow and chill with its touch of swag and chiefa references.  'Love Song' I see a lot of lovers playing this track for the one they love on those intimate nights, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />'Half Of Me' is a fabulous song exposing Rihanna's insecurities and how those might judge her under the microscope as an entertainer.  Rihanna also goes back to her dancehall roots some with 'No Love Allowed' that bares in slight comparison to 'Man Down' from Loud.  'Love Without Tragedy' starts off great as it seems like she's once again touching base with she and Chris's relationship again, I love the piano rhythm that remains me of 'Where does Broken Hearts Go' by Ms. Whitney Houston.  Diamonds completely delivers as it's one of her first singles from this album.<br /><br />In terms of flaws on the album, there aren't many.  However, as a person who keeps it 100% and loves me some Rihanna to offer constructive criticism, 'Stay' -- I wish I could had liked.  Rihanna still isn't pulling me in good enough to sing those slow, balladry songs as I'd like, yet she's improving compared to other albums she's attempted.<br /><br />In closing all I have to say is: BUY THIS ALBUM!  If you a Rihanna fan or supporter you'll probably enjoy this one.<br /><br />Rating 4.5/5et she's improving compared to other albums she's attempted.<br /><br />In closing all I have to say is: BUY THIS ALBUM!  If you a Rihanna fan or supporter you'll probably enjoy this one.<br /><br />Rating 4.5/5

The only thing I think is bad about this is the fact that I loved a lot of the bonus scenes and wish they had been added into the theatrical cut. I was also hoping for a director's cut or extended edition.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows on television right now. Almost makes me consider getting cable again but prefer watching commercial free.

Stop writing books so I can get to sleep on time. :)<br /><br />My first sf was Gibson's Neuromancer in the late 80's. and almost as soon as I finished his masterpiece, I began searching for more. Something as immersive in environment and character. Something that would haunt my thoughts day or night, and would not let me go. Your Wool Omnibus is that something!<br /><br />Thank you, truly THANK YOU, for writing Wool.<br /><br />Now, it's time to finally sleep......

B005S9EK1S|5.0|This movie is just as good as the book. A good movie for me is one that I csn watch many times and not become bored. This is one of those for my collection. The choices of actors are great and believable. The story is sentimental and sweet, the way I like my love stories!

Unlike the flaurecent light, led light is much closer to natural lights so my eyes are not getting as tired as they did with the flaurecent baulbs. The only problem that I had was that one of the baulbs was broken, but I did nit have the time to send it back and get a new one.

0887307280|5.0|Best book I have ever read on running a small business the most efficient way. Great tips on figuring out your best role within your own business, and how to improve the process. The book is written about fictional characters to explain the concepts in a fluid way. I enjoyed it, and even though published years ago, all the info still applies today.

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I have not read these books but I've heard so much about them that I've wanted to see this.  It was suspenseful, sad, funny, and rewarding entertainment.  I'm going to keep watching this franchise.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|It exceeded my expectations. It had great CG and a sense of humor in the most unexpected places. The story line flowed like silk.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept me on my toes wondering what's next I couldn't put it downnnn I can't wait to read the second one!
B009YU6FJM|4.0|The Deftones are always excellent.<br /><br />However, with that being said I honestly haven't been THIS impressed with an album of their's since White Pony's release. There is something happening on Koi No Yokan that hasn't appeared in a while. I'm still having trouble pin pointing what that is exactly, but there is just an emotion and intensity to this album that some of the more recent releases haven't quite reached.<br /><br />A couple of the high points on the album are, first, Chino's voice has never been better, whether he is fired up or using clean vocals he is in full form here. Another point is Carpenter really brings his part to the table here, his guitar riffs/lines are at their catchiest and most hypnotic since the early 2000's.<br /><br />I would say the album is a healthy mix of Around the fur and Saturday Night Wrist.<br /><br />A solid work from these guys, up there with their best.<br /><br />UPDATE: Having listened to the album a number of times now, I think I now consider this my favorite Deftones album!

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I thought it was going to be yet another jewel Qwest game that I got sick of long before Android devices even came out but I think the name of the title &amp; pictures really caught my eye. Of course as you can see from the pictures it is like the jewel quest games where you switch the 2 objects between their spaces to line up objects but there's something about this game that makes it not so boring. I guess you could say it's jewel quest with hidden objects that you have to find that goes along with the nice story &amp; each world level has it's own story descriptions that are interesting. The graphics are beautiful &amp; I love the background music. The game starts out easy &amp; slowly gets harder at a decent pace that doesn't stay so easy that it's boring nor does it get so hard to fast that makes it frustrating but you may have to try the harder levels more than once &amp; it's a good idea to save your magic charms for the harder levels.  I noticed another game by the same name but it's by a different developer that looks like the same exact thing but don't get fooled, you can tell the developer didn't put as much skill or time into their version of this game, it really looks terrible after playing this one.  One thing that I can say it's that I was surprised the game itself was so big but after seeing hire much detail was put into it I guess I shouldn't be to surprised. Sorry about the long review I just wanted to express how surprised I was at how this game turned out. I how it helps anyone who it's interested.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Great soundtrack to a great movie.  The first couple times you listen to the Riff off track it throws you off because it is so different from the movie. Also very sad that Titanium wasn't on the cd. Other than that great cd and wonderful and speedy delivery.
0446580848|2.0|I'm a DeMille fan, but I found the Panther boreing. It is slow and predictable and John Corey's incessent wisecracking and banter wore thin after about fifty pages. The book has 567 pages, 500 of which were setup and only the last 60 or so were action.
1594201927|5.0|Niall Ferguson is a captivating story teller, and he makes sure the tales he tells are based upon documented history. And then, he links all of his stories together and leads us through the planet's modern history of commerce from its improbably beginnings in Europe to the very hare to predict future that lies before us. Entertaining and educational.

0679882820|3.0|It's ok, but nothing great. My child enjoys more the pictures than rhymes. The thing that I really like about this book is the format: convenient for babies and toddlers to hold in their hands.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I fell for the water cooler hype and finally broke down and rented this.  Within 10 minutes I was wondering if I accidently rented a different film.  Sadly... I was not impressed with the acting nor the dance segments. Either I must have had higher expectations for my movie experience, or the women at my office saw a completely different film.  I suggest you save your money and watch the trailer... you will see just as much without prolonging the agony of sitting through a poorly made film.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever!  After like 2 months after begging for it I finally got it.  Download this awesome game.  I think this game is perfect for people who like to build, or who like games with zombies and stuff like that.  If you're not sure if you're going to like this game download the demo first.  Thank you for reading my review.  I'm so sorry if this was not helpful.

I kept waiting for it to get funny and interesting. Thought it ended poorly. Boring, tired actors swearing alot. Great if you like to be reminded how lame salespeople act in the office.

0670026182|5.0|I can't begin to convey the total esthetic and culinary delight that this book is. I've been following Katie's blog, and have been swooning at her incredibly original and endlessly inventive creations. There is no other food stylist OR photographer as good as her -- and I work in the industry. Usually it would take 2 geniuses to create work of this caliber -- an incredible stylist and a great photographer. The fact that Katie can play both roles, when in fact she's a graphic designer by training, is a testament to her enormous genius and talent. My favorite photograph is of the Carrot cakes with cointreau-soaked sultanas --  cupcakes on a cake stand with a long precious drool of syrup juuuust about to drop off the edge of the cake stand. Photo perfection.<br /><br />The design is also immaculate; attention has been paid to the tiniest detail -- recipes are numbered and categorized; the typefaces are beautifully organic and reminiscent of recipe cards that one has had and used for years -- scans of old checkered paper back several of the recipe pages, giving a warm, homey feel to the book as if we're being let in on a long-kept family secret.<br /><br />The recipes are also thoroughly enthralling... They range from fairly easy (Blood Orange, Mango and Peach Granita) to more involved but very rewarding (Roast Pork with Apple, Apricot and Pistachio Stuffing). Needless to say, the photographs make me want to lick the pages AND give me the desire to try all the recipes, though -- pray God -- not all at once.<br /><br />As an art director I often buy cookbooks with no intention of cooking, just for the esthetic delight. This is definitely THE book of any I own or have seen, that offers the MOST culinary / kitchen-y rapture to the eye. It doesn't get any better than this for food photography. Get it while you can. Even if you're feeling lazy, you'll be seduced to try these recipes before you can stop yourself.
030759565X|5.0|All I can say is, wow. The photography is clean and nice, exactly the style you come to like from her blog, and she has all those little narratives in every recipe that tells you exactly why this recipe is worth your/her time, and how it came to be. Peeling off the outer paper flap reveals a breathtakingly beautiful cover, and personally I prefer the inner cover more than the outer one.. Great recipes, a beautiful book.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Definitely worth reading...I have tried it for 3 months now and have lost ten pounds and a rash that I couldnt get rid of for seven years.  I am amazed at how little I miss the foods that I once lived on.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I read the first two so I had to read this one -- more of the same.  Its probably great for another age group -- I'm 45-50, minivan Mom so its just not my thing.  But I will finish it to see what happens!  I wish Gale had a bigger part in the series.<br /><br />This book, BTW, is not for preadolesence (its for 13 and over).  (Did I spell that right?!)
B001AQO3QA|5.0|the only complaint I have is how you take the blu rays out of each slot, I get scarred the disc will get scratched when taking the movie in and out of the case, it's not like the ordinary Blu Ray Case where you just pop up the disc.  thats my only complaint other then that the movies are great and the case has cool designs on it.
B009B50QOU|4.0|I've got all of Green Day's studio albums and this is right in the middle in terms of overall song quality.  I personally like Green Day's more pop friendly turns (Warning) and this album is more in line with that as opposed to their Rock Opera turn they've taken recently.  I enjoyed Nuclear Family and Let Yourself Go the most.
1401235417|5.0|This is the reason to be excited for the New 52, this hands down is true story telling for our Dark Knight and by far my favorite Batman comic<br /><br />I've been collecting as many Batman graphic novels that my paychecks would allow and after being somewhat not interested in the New 52 , that all changed after reading this issue. The new story line does nothing but justice to Batman, and literally adds a new breath of fresh air into the Batman story arks. For the longest time I thought nothing could be the Long Halloween, Dark Victory, Haunted Knight , serious but this holds up to the classics.<br /><br />The writing is brilliantly done, the artwork is well defined, dark and like a fast exciting  roller coaster ride all the way to the end, which has made waiting for VOL 2 nearly impossible..If your a Batman fan , this by far is one piece of the collection you can not pass up
B007SGLZP8|4.0|True to John Grisham form,  this book is hard to put down! Great story..definitely recommend to every reader! I never pass up on his novels and have read them all!
B005COO1X6|3.0|I will preface this review by saying I am not a Stephen King fan.  I do not dislike King but I, by no means, am a big fan of his.  So please read this review with that in mind.  If you are a big Stephen King fan then your feelings may be different.  I review this simply as a fan of short fiction.<br /><br />This Kindle Single is a short horror story/sci-fi tale of a boy asleep at an abandoned rest stop and a mystery unfolding at the entrance to that rest stop (Mile Post 81).  It is the story of several car loads of people (and individuals) who stop to investigate that mystery.  There is a lot of death but not excessively gory.  I was not blown away by the ending but the story itself kept me interested.  This short story is well worth the price and will appeal to both horror fans and science fiction fans.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|What most fans forget about collections such as this is that they are not the target demographic for it. Save for the inclusion of the &#34;okay&#34;, &#34;Never Give Up' and the new duet version of &#34;I Look to You&#34;, this collection is targeted at the mainstream consumer who may only have her debut and &#34;The Bodyguard&#34; in their collection.<br /><br />After the perplexing release of her first double album greatest hits, the mainstream fan, unfamiliar with the club mixes, did not have a straight ahead collection of the radio friendly, mass marketed hits. In this era of downloading, the more hardcore fan has the ability to purchase the two &#34;new&#34; songs from the Mp3 store.<br /><br />Complimented to the recent CBS Grammy special, &#34;We'll Always Love You&#34;, the sales of this version should increase exponentially after it airs. Even the cover shot, is one familiar to the hardcore fan.<br /><br />If Diana Ross as a solo artists held the Queen of Pop/Soul crossover from the 70s through the mid-80s, she passed on her throne to Whitney from the mid-80s through the 90s. Both ladies held their throne for at least 15 years (with Diana banking another 10 years from her days as lead of the Supremes). History may well see Beyonce taking over the crown from the millennium to 2012. (Madonna fans must lick their wounds because though she had the occasional exposure at R&B, she never dominated both the pop and R&B charts the way diana and Whitney did through their respective eras. To add injury to misery, both Whitney and Diana achieved enough success on the silver screen, that madonna must only envy). The runner-ups Mariah and Janet have had successful careers, though not as widespread and consistent over the pop, R&B and Adult Contemporary charts. Diana would also formidable success in jazz and even classical (with The Two Tenors) while Whitney can boast the best selling gospel album. Mariah, Janet nor Madonna have yet to expand their horizons beyond pop and soul.<br /><br />Everyone has their Whitney favorites with mine being &#34;Saving All My Love For You&#34;, &#34;I'm Every Woman&#34;, &#34;I'm Your Baby Tonight&#34; and &#34;I Will Always Love You&#34;. In another era, RCA/Sony (which ironically has a portion of Diana's domestic catalog) could expect to sell tonnage through the holiday season. But in the era of downloads and iPods, Greatest Hits collections are much harder to predict. She probably won't get a lot of AirPlay on &#34;Never Give Up&#34; or the R. Kelly &#34;I Look to You&#34; duet.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|bought with Kindle.  Fit perfectly and does a nice job protecting.  Has been durable after about 6 months of use and I thought it might now wear out but its been great.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|Excellent, smart, witty. A fantastic addition to the Discworld books. I have all of them and I read them again and again and always enjoy them.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a sweetheart of a movie that touches one's heart no matter what age. It's a love story between two, just barely into their teens, young boy and girl. It's a bit like Romeo and Juliette and also involves family and their  young  fellow contemporaries. There's nothing like your first love, especially when you're a teen, you just never forget it. Of course the fun also comes from seeing how the grownups handle it. Ace actors like Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray and Edward Norton give wonderfully touching performances as the befuddled adults. It's one of the best coming of age movies in recent times.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am a big fan of halfbrick games - I have about 20 of them on my kindle. And just when I thought that their games couldn't get any better, I was proved wrong. There are many different costumes and jetpacks to choose from, and many different fun levels to play. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes to have fun (:
B008YKRRH2|1.0|I'm a huge fan of Otto Klemperer.  I own so many Klemperer recordings I've long lost count.  In my book, he is one of the five greatest conductors of all time.  And there is no composer whose music means more to me than the one I consider the greatest of them all, Anton Bruckner.  It's hard for me still, after all these years, to believe that any human being could conceive such a vision, and then successfully execute it, as Bruckner did.  Bruckner demonstrates such creativity and genius in the process.  His musical achievements are, in my opinion, the greatest of all composers.  I consider Bruckner to be without peers.<br /><br />So, Klemperer + Bruckner = Nirvana, right?  If only it were so.  Unfortunately, having heard most of these recordings, I have to say that Otto Klemperer, as brilliant as he is, just doesn't *get* Bruckner.  If, as Hans-Hubert Schonzeler said, \\"Bruckner's music is in reality one gigantic arch which starts on Earth amidst suffering humanity, travels up to the Heavens to the very throne of grace, and returns with a message of peace,\\" Klemperer's version doesn't generally leave earth, and doesn't bring much of a sense of peace or catharsis (instead, it mostly brings relief that it's over).  As much as I wish it so, I don't hear an \\"other-worldly element\\" in Klemperer's Bruckner--it stays earthbound.  Bruckner symphonies without the spiritual dimension is kind of like Beethoven's Pastoral re-envisioned as a trip to Wal-Mart.  It just doesn't work.<br /><br />A number of these recordings are considered legendary, particularly the 6th.  For the life of me, I have no idea why that particular recording is so well regarded in so many quarters.  It seems to me that Klemperer misses the 6th by a mile.  In some of the most magical spiritual moments of the 6th, such as the coda to the first movement, the second movement, and parts of the last movement, I just hear notes.  Bruckner's 5th in Klemperer's hands is an unsmiling, severe, sonic blast of titanicstrength, yet without the vulnerability, yearning, and re-birth.  While Klemperer's 5th can't help but to make an impression if only through decibels, in the end, it's an empty exercise compared to what conductors like Karajan, Jochum, and Celibidache bring to this symphony (and to Bruckner in general).<br /><br />If you are considering this set without knowing Bruckner's music very well, I would not recommend starting here.  The easy first choice of where to start is:  Karajan's stunning box set of Bruckner Symphonies #1-9 [[ASIN:B001DCQI8W Bruckner: 9 Symphonies [Box Set]]].  Herbert von Karajan is everything in Bruckner that Klemperer is not.  Many consider Karajan the greatest Bruckner conductor of all, and I am definitely among that group.  With the exception of Bruckner's radical 1st symphony, which is not convincingly done in Karajan's set (Jochum's recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, from his first complete Bruckner cycle on DG, is the one to get), every single other recording in Karajan's cycle is outstanding and at the very top of the list of the greatest recordings of that particular symphony.  And further, the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic has to be heard to be believed--arguably it's the greatest orchestral playing you'll ever hear, in any works.<br /><br />I could not imagine not being able to go without hearing Klemperer's Beethoven, Wagner, and selected works by other composers (Klemperer's Mahler is certainly very well regarded, but I'm not the biggest Mahler fan myself).  But Klemperer unfortunately does not bring to Bruckner the insights for which he is so well regarded with many other composers.  Klemperer simply does not *get* Bruckner.  There's no crime in that, because many great conductors don't get Bruckner either.  But there are many who do, and you'll be much happier listening to Karajan, Jochum, Giulini, Celidibache, Skrowaczewski, etc., when it comes to Bruckner.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Totally addicted to Downton Abbey.  Absolutely love this series - Watched the whole thing in 5 days - five stars
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|Inductive charging isn't some new technology, but it just makes sense for a device like the Magic Mouse. Plopping the mouse on the charging pad once a week is totally painless and feels very futuristic. I do have one complaint though, and it's that the battery in the pack doesn't last all that long. I can make it a week with moderate usage, but I find that a bit low. Other than that, extremely solid product, especially for the $34 I paid for it at the time of this review.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use; love the large buttons. Better than the one on my cell or the one on my laptop.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I've played my share of tablet games and I have enjoyed final fantasy 3 a lot. This game is worth a look over. I've played most of the final fantasy games since the 1980's. I like how the beginning starts and builds up during the course of the game. The class system could be done better, but that's personal opinion not fact. Hope your a fan of the final fantasy series, because I believe that's the type of motivation you need to play this game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Classic John Grisham, a page turner that keeps you guessing until the end.  I read it and now I am rereading it because I missed some connections at the first. It is even better the second read.  I have read all his books and this is a good one.

B009YU6FJM|3.0|Having listened to the full album a few times I think I've gotten into the point where I could do a review without a knee jerk reaction. The album spans just over 50 minutes with 11 tracks so there's quite a bit of music with several longer than average tracks which is cool. In regards to the songs themselves I hate to say it but I feel an overall \\"samey\\" tone throughout the album. For the most part you get a cooing whispering Chino that gets a bit overdone/used. This reminded me of Saturday Night Wrist where the band went on a softer tone but the tracks varied enough to keep your senses going up and down. One of the biggest downsides to the album is there aren't really any \\"go to\\" tracks. What I mean by that is I usually pick up some songs throughout an album I always head to due to the overall tune of the song, perhaps a certain spot or rhythm section that makes the track awesome. For Koi No Yokan I only have this \\"go to\\" sense for Leathers and Entombed. I do like how in Goon Squad it sounds like Chino's sneezing in an echo loop ha. Overall though most of the songs seem to just go on a bit too long with a low energy whispery samey feel. Not a bad album but more or less a filler; perhaps my least favorite album by the Deftones.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Everyone knows the outcome of the raid to get UBL, but almost no one knows the type of man and the years of grueling training  that went into making the mission a complete success. This book, despite the known outcome, is suspenseful and riveting.  That takes a special writer and a special story, and this book combines both.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just angry birds. The best way to waste time.  I really like the Kindle Fire.  I've had it a week.
0393327655|3.0|There is much in this book that I agree with.  His main point is that religion's truth claims should be as open to discussion as any other truth claims that humans interact with.  We should not place a critical discussion of religion on the shelf, simply because it is religion.  Human progress comes by way of critical discussion and investigation.  Religion should not get a pass in this regard.  To discuss honor killings, genital mutilation, and the killing of noncombatants without looking at the religious truth claims that motivate such immorality is to talk in a vacuum.<br /><br />I particularly like chapters three and four.  Chapter three is entitled, \\"In the Shadow of God.\\"  He lays out a brief history of how Christians mistreated and tortured Jews and so-called witches.  There really is much more that could be said about these two topics, especially the shameful way that Christians treated Jews throughout history.  Chapter four is entitled, \\"The Trouble with Islam.  I appreciate the blunt language he uses in describing the crimes perpetrated by those who claim Islam as their faith.  He shows that it is the truth claims of that faith that motivate immoral behavior, as opposed to other alleged factors.  It is logical that many of the Islamic faith act that way, given what their holy book says.  He lists many passages in the Koran that justify what we in the West would consider unethical behavior.  Of course, we in the West can criticize religious truth claims.  Anyone in the Muslim world would fear for his or her life if they were to question the Koran.<br /><br />I was surprised that he thinks there is some scientific evidence for psychic phenomena.  He says, \\"There also seems to be a body of data attesting to the reality of psychic phenomena, much of which has been ignored by mainstream science.\\"  I find myself wondering if Michael Shermer, Daniel Dennett, and Richard Dawkins would disagree with Harris on this topic.<br /><br />I cringe at the idea of torture.He lays out an argument that it might be necessary at times.  Do we really want to have people whose main function is to torture another person?  Torture is very personal.  Harris imagines that we can get around this dilemma by developing a pill that would torture someone; yet, it would look like he or she was sleeping.  When the person woke up, he would be so frightened about going through that experience again that he would spill his guts.  He euphemistically calls it a \\"truth pill.\\"  I'd rather see us spend time and effort in developing a real truth pill that would cause someone to speak the truth without torturing his mind, or his body, in the process. It seems to me the latter suggestion is more in line with a humanistic approach to life. As our scientific understanding of how the brain functions increases, such a goal doesn't seem so farfetched. If we can perfect humane ways of getting information, is that not more in line with our Western democratic values?<br /><br />The book is okay, but there are better books out there.  I think Christopher Hitchens's book entitled, \\"God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything,\\" and Richard Dawkins's book entitled, \\"The God Delusion\\" are much better.  However, they approach the irrationality of religion from somewhat different angles than Harris does in this book.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Most excellente! A real sleeper Sci-Fi hidden at just $1.99. Nice acting by relatively unknown actors, good sound track, good filming, good but limited CGI. Well worth more.<br />No special clips during or after the credits.

I Connected with Peter's emotion and spirituality, couldn't believe his over the top behavior, and felt bad for him during the reunion tours due to Gene and Paul's financial control.  This book seems VERY honest and love it or hate it, this is a fun read and a great new perspective on the KISS years with the original lineup.  I enjoyed this book a lot and learned a ton about Peter.  Thank you Peter for the wonderful book!
B009X01C64|5.0|I have 3 covers and this is by far my favorite. It was hard to get the Kindle in the plastic holder at first but then I got it in and it will hold even if I throw it across the room,not that I would. In the land scape position there are three notches to get just the right angle for you. You can also rotate it, so it stands up in the portrait position.<br />Things to keep in mind. You want to make sure the plastic holder is rotated in the right position before you put the Kindle in. You want to make sure the opening for the speakers line up but that also, the USB port for charging is going to be on the outside so you can close the case when you are charging. I didn't have it lined up correctly and at first I though it was a design flaw, until I realized I could rotate the holder all the way around.<br />It is a nice soft leather, with an elastic band to hold the case closed. These features make it the best one I've seen yet, very sturdy and versatile and nice looking.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I was slightly disappointed with the film. The could have done so much more with it. All the funny parts were shown on the trailer which was sad. I guess I might have expected too much from the main character. A lot of blood with not a whole lot of fun.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|It was a good comedy. Typical laughs. I wouldn't rent it again but it is fun to watch once. Good for a group movie. Follows the same as prior movies in this &#34;series&#34;
1743117094|5.0|Fifty years ago, Laurel witnessed a horrible tragedy. Her beloved mother stabbed a man who entered their farmhouse yard and killed him. Laurel knew her mother intended to kill the man, but she couldn't believe it until now.<br /><br />Fifty years later, Laurel's mother is dying. Now Laurel wants to know what really happened all those years ago and most of all why. She begins a quest and enlists her brother Gerry, who was a baby at the time, to find why her mother killed the intruder.<br /><br />The story is told through several characters. Laurel tell the story in the present, but interspersed with that we have stories from her mother and her mother's friends from WWII. It is a credit to the author's talent that she is able to weave the time periods together and keep the reader anxious for more.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys mystery and romance. The book is well researched and gives an accurate picture of the hardship faced by ordinary people in Great Britain during the blitz. At first I didn't like moving back and forth between the time periods. It seemed to slow the action. I wanted to know why the murder occurred. However, the back and forth movement became rhythmic and gave me a chance to know the characters. Once in they flow, I found it an excellent way to tell the story.<br /><br />I reviewed this book for Net Galley.

B008GXHOFW|1.0|We downloaded this directly from the Kindle Fire and knew about the additional memory required... but my goodness, this game is a HUGE memory hog and we have to delete quite a few apps from it in order for it to be fully downloaded.
B009VB97EY|5.0|This gets pretty deeP. Magic mike was hot and steamy. The dance was awesome. It was a bit mature at times.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|The book is well written and I think that events such as these during the war should never be forgotten.
B004NSVF7C|4.0|The reviewers who rate this low often say it is too long for the material, and they have a valid point, but I enjoyed it. Gilkey, the subject of the book, reminds me of many other criminals I dealt with in my years in the FBI, rationalizing his thievery, so that part wasn't very surprising. I did find the book to be a fascinating peek into the world of rare book collectors. Good nonfiction teaches you something you didn't know before, and this succeeds handsomely at that. The lack of care against theft by so many book sellers also didn't surprise me, although I always feel sympathy for crime victims. Book collectors as portrayed here remind me of geocachers I know, or even some shopaholics of my acquaintance, whose primary characteristic is a drive to acquire more and more of something, whether it be kitsch or cache finds. For most it is a harmless, or even constructive, pastime, but the Gilkeys of the world are just so obsessed they cross the line of morals and law.<br /><br />I listened to this on CD. The reader's pleasant voice and reading style were very nice and the book did not require constant attention, which made it ideal for an audiobook in the car. I found it amusing that at one point the author mentions that during her interview with Gilkey he often used a large and sophisticated vocabulary, but mispronounced some words, indicating he was widely read but grew up around people who weren't; then the reader mispronounced some of the words in the book (e.g., ogle, nucleic acid, mischievous). Still, readers of most audiobooks are worse in this regard; I'll never understand why directors don't make them re-read the sections with such errors. This reader was above average.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Took me while to get into it and it got off to a slow start. Overall a good follow up to the first one and A must read if you liked book one.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|After catching their MTV series, I decided to watch the movie and I must say it did not disappoint. You were able to feel Nev's different emotions right along with him, from what seemed like feelings of falling in love to his heartbreak.<br /><br />This movie had a lot of twist and turns that you will enjoy.

B008TTPQXA|3.0|At least that is what Eben Alexander is convinced of in his fascinating book.However as a brain surgeon he seemed to lose his objectivity in assessing his out of body experience and supposed visit to the heavenly realms while in a coma.

0761171703|5.0|Truly captures the spirit of dance in very un-convectional places, with room to spare in this great collection of images.
B003PDQEBS|5.0|This movie is visually stunning and a great adaptation of the book! Colin Firth is extraordinary, as always. As is Julianne Moore. Tom Ford did a great job as a director and screenwriter. Slightly differences from the book, but doesn't change the tone of the story at all
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love Kaley Cuoco ( and Jim Parsons). I never get tired of watching the show, it's always fun to watch.  It's comedy anyone can relate to. I hope they never stop making new episodes.
B007URCTOG|5.0|Just as good as the notebook. I cried for both. This is a total romance chick flick. Must watch alone because you may cry.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book really gave me an insight into another world... one I am not familiar with but because of the story line, I could relate to it.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|My family and I loved this movie, great movie for the children! Highly recommend!!!! We've watched it over and over again. Sharing it with my nieces now as well.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I couldn't wait to get it in my hands, on my kindle. Downloaded at midnight the day it came out!<br />I couldnt guess the ending, nor the twists and turns. I loved it! Now waiting for the next one! Thanks John!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was a strange story. Lots of medical stuff discussed. His experience with heaven seemed exhausting. I didn't understand the whole process.
B007NVJ7NU|4.0|A cinematic psychedelic trip that takes you on an other-worldly experience. Edgy, violent, and surreal ... turn the lights out and let this movie take you away -

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven brought me comfort in my time of grief.  Dr. Alexander does a wonderful job of explaining his NDE and reminds the reader that science does not explain everything.  He is living proof of that,
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very well written - kept the reader unaware of various \\"motivations\\" until the final scenes were revealed. Great tale, which I consider one of Grishams best. Kept me glued to the Kindle for a couple of days.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Since I can not remember what this is about, I don't think it was that good. It was not memorable.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have to say I was waiting for a novel like that for a while, forget about story telling skills, we all know Grisham is excellent at that, but I was waiting for somehow a plot, some legal thriller, a bit of court-room thriller. Although this isn't one of Grisham's better ones, but it is different, and I loved it, loved reading it, loved the surprises, and the details.Of course, like in a,, thrillers and movies of this kind, there are quite some stretches and what I think are plot holes. But it's part of the thrill really.
B00873I4R8|3.0|Just received this blu-ray steelbook in the mail, and it's only 1 disc in the book, and it's the pg-13 version. but enjoying the artwork for this steelbook though. also, the rating given is for the steelbook only having 1 disc only, unlike the blu-ray extended cut with both the pg-13 and r ratings.
1451638450|5.0|Finally, Ivan gets his own book! Ivan Vorpatril is the cousin of major Bujold hero, Miles Vorkosigan, often pulled unwillingly into Miles's dangerous schemes. In Ivan's last appearance, in *A Civil Campaign*, he surprised himself and others by showing heroic qualities.<br /><br />Ivan has carefully avoided marriage for many years by avoiding long-term relationships. However, at age 35, with his short-term relationships growing less frequent and less fun, he thinks maybe it would be time to settle down. But the pool of suitable women has dried up and now marriage seems to be avoiding him. His duties as staff officer to an Admiral take him to the planet Komarr. Byerly Vorrutyer is working there as an undercover agent for Imperial Security (ImpSec) and shows up one night with a request for Ivan to check up on a young woman who might be in danger. He wants Ivan to ask her out so she won't be home when a kidnap attempt is rumored to be taking place.<br /><br />Ivan flirts with the woman and asks her out; but instead gets stunned and tied to a chair in the woman's apartment -- when the kidnappers indeed show up. The young woman, nicknamed \\"Tej,\\" turns out to be a very important person indeed and determined to get away from being very important, since \\"very important\\" and \\"soon to be dead\\" appear to be equivalent labels.<br /><br />Bujold has experimented with many science fiction forms and genre combinations in her series, with her own twists. Her early novels were often space adventures. *Memory* was a detective story with the murder being slowly in progress; it was also a story about surviving near death and becoming a real adult. *A Civil Campaign* was a drawing-room comedy-romance filled with witty dialogue. *Captain Vorpatril's Alliance* is a romance caper, with Ivan taking the Cary Grant role (EARLY Cary Grant, handsome but confused). As always with Bujold, the plot is twisty and the dialogue and writing are witty. You are pretty sure how the story will turn out; but it gets there in clever and unexpected ways.<br /><br />Bujold writes her books with an attempt to give them the ability to be read as stand-alones. You can see that in this book as she gives enough background to Ivan's family and life to balance the current story. However, I have read all of the Vorkosigan books at least twice and can no longer tell if a reader new to the series would appreciate these later volumes. If you have already gotten into the series, you'll enjoy this one. If not, I recommend as starting points the collections *Young Miles* (the first two novels about Miles, with a prize winning short story) or *Cordelia's Honor* (the two novels about Miles's parents). Each collection includes novels which have won the Hugo Award for best novel. Bujold is probably the best writer of character in science fiction and one of the best writers of character in any genre.t it gets there in clever and unexpected ways.<br /><br />Bujold writes her books with an attempt to give them the ability to be read as stand-alones.

B0096HID5M|5.0|We bought this one. Great music, love the 80s theme. Good actors. Good outfits. The best I have seen in a while.
1439181780|5.0|In the same line, this book show how the attraction's law works through the power of love. Gives lots of inspiration.
B009D5VNLS|2.0|There was not a particular aspect of the movie that was particularly disappointing. It was just weak all around. The animation was good, but the storyline and character development was shallow and predictable. It was like watching a high quality Saturday morning cartoon episode. Plus the message for children was not exactly exemplary: while your defiant spirit gets you in trouble, it can also get you out of it. Hmmm... dunno about that.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This is one of those movies that you have to see more than once to catch the things you missed the first time around.  The concepts are interesting, but you have to pay attention so you don't get lost.  It is similar to Memento and the Matrix in that you have to follow a different way of thinking throughout the movie to get the full impact.  In this case, you are in a dream world, and in fact...dreams within dreams.  And, \\"dream rules\\" apply and \\"dream time\\" slows down at the different dream levels.  I found this really intriguing and fun to watch.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|Best ever. Great music. Great actors. Overall great movie. Totally recommend this to anyone that likes music and a pretty clean movie
1451673442|5.0|Althought I already knew about the &#34;The Secret&#34; Series, this book is the most practical for incorporating the attraction law in your life with easy step by step guide to make it an habit.

B005K17RU0|5.0|App keeps me up to date with accurate weather forecast. Never had any problems with this app as long as I stay connected to the Internet. Even worked great when traveling using free wi-fi from state to state. No complaints on this app and would definitely recommend to friends and others interested in any weather apps.
B0073PZIYI|5.0|This is a great sci-fi. I love the futuristic idea of this movie. Justin is a great actor. Overall good.
030758836X|1.0|The book kept my attention at first. I think the only reason I finished it was because I had spent the money to buy it. I found the two main characters completely irredeemable, especially the wife.  It's hard for me to get into a book if I can't find some way to relate to the characters, and these 2 were nothing but liars, cheaters and totally self involved. I kept hoping the wife would end up in jail at the end of the book but she didn't.  I found the ending to be toally unsatisfactory, like watching someone commit more than one crime and go on living their lives without consequence, while those people all around them suffered. I would not recommend this book to anybody, I absolutely hated it.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Was better than I thought. I had no expectations going into the movie.  Don't pass this over if you're worried about it being lame.
B004KD5TQI|4.0|As the movie looks and plays a lot like a long music video, I thought I would check out the soundtrack.  There are some great covers, sung by movie cast members, and a couple of good original songs too. Edgy dance music - fun to drive to as well. Highlights include the cover of Sweet Dreams and the medley I Want it All/We Will Rock You. I like Love is the Drug as well as the cover of White Rabit -(for a better version of White Rabit get the cover by Collide). This is a strong soundtrack album - I find myself ofter dissappointed by soundtracks but this flows well as an album and is a great companion to the film.
B00845PV16|4.0|If you liked the first one you will like this. Same style and same story line. Great effects. Very sci-fi.

1400069289|5.0|I had read plenty of books on habit, change and self improvement. This is definitely one of the best which I would recommend, particularly for those who are aware of the need to change their habit for good but in lack of the means to carry on. It is so entertainingly written and well organized that I am sure most people even those with little knowledge on psychology or weak will power/self-discipline can benefit from it. The cue-routine-reward loop premise on building/replacing a habit is so simple and practical. In short, a must read!<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.<br />If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group. Belief is essential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people. Pg93<br />Once Bowman established a few core routines in Phelps's life, all the other habits - his diet and practice schedules, the stretching and sleep routines -seemed to fall into place on their own. At the core of why those habits were so effective, why they acted as keystone habits, was something known within academic literature as a \\"small win\\". ...\\"Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win. Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach. Pg112<br />Willpower isn't just a skill. It's a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there's less power left over for other thing. Pg137<br />As their willpower muscles strengthened, good habits seemed to spill over into other parts of their lives....People get better at regulating their impulses. They learn how to distract themselves from temptations. And once you've gotten into that willpower groove, your brain is practiced at helping you focus on a goal. Pg139<br />We are not in the coffee business serving people. We are in the people business serving coffee. - Howard Behar, former president of Starbucks pg141<br />Starbucks taught their employees how to handle moments of adversity by giving them willpower habit loops...One of the system they use is called LATTE method. Listen to customer. Acknowledge their complaint. Take action by solving the problem. Thank them, and then Explain why the problem occurred. Pg145<br />When people are asked to do something that takes self-control, if they think they are doing it for personal reasons- if they feel like it's a choice or something they enjoy because it helps someone else-it's much less taxing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, if they're just following orders, their willpower muscles get tired much faster. Pg151g you focus on a goal.

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Another stellar addition to Sanderson's cosmere, with a magic system that is well thought out and very engaging. It's not just cool; it carries with it philosophical implications for the characters, who are impressively round for such a short narrative. Any fan of Sanderson, unique magic systems, or Asian-influenced fantasy would do well to pick it up. Oh, and if you are an Elantris fan, keep an eye out for some Easter eggs. Excellent read.

0762777931|3.0|I get the vocabulary and the marketing angle here....it's like Skinny Bitch but on a perky, self-love level rather than self-hate.  But I'm 27 and talk pretty vulgar and even I was thrown off by \\"titties\\".  Just hard to take seriously in a book that covers serious topics.<br /><br />I really am not into the juicing despite the popularity craze and health benefits of it. The time spent juicing and the money put into both a decent juicer and a weekly purchase of the entire produce aisle is just too much.  If however, I were suffering from an illness then I'd would definitely consider it.  Shots of wheat grass juice sounds fantastic but again the time and money just aren't feasible unless there's something like illness that would make the sacrifice worthwhile.  You can have an outstandingly healthy, disease-preventing diet without the juicing...to me the juicing is more of a pricey  high quality supplement.  I prefer to make green smoothies and/or just eat my veggies in their whole form.<br /><br />I read the part about the 21-day cleanse and almost passed out from stress. lol  That's quite a to-do list.  Though I won't knock it entirely because these would be great things to introduce more gradually.  There would be no serenity in my life whatsoever if I had to chase around that to-do list for 21 days.<br /><br />But I do think this is a good \\"beginner\\" book for girls a bit younger than me and even females my age or older that haven't been exposed to information like this (I didn't include males just because it's not marketed towards them).  Nothing in the book was really new for me; it really does seem more like an all around healthy lifestyle \\"starter book\\".  I tend to disagree with their calling it a \\"diet\\" but being a marketing gal myself, I know that calling something a diet or saying that it will help you lose weight will certainly bring in more interested people and therefore more cash.<br /><br />So overall advice, if you're already privy to the vegan lifestyle, have already done your nutrition research, know the benefits of yoga, etc. you don't need this book.  If you're new to all that great stuff, then this book is perfect.e, have already done your nutrition research, know the benefits of yoga, etc. you don't need this book.

0425263908|1.0|Poor story quality, poor story line, poor writing.  Saw way too much similarity in places that mimiced 50 Shades, but the author could have worked around them and took another track.  Looks like she just had to get those phrases and topics in her book.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|It still has the same birds,but it doesn't have the pigs in it any more (at least at the beginning I don't know about the rest). You are freeing birds from cages,instead of trying to get you eggs back from the piggies. I guess it's okay,but I don't think it's worth paying for.

I only became a hater with all albums after this.<br />This particular album has no target audience-in the sense of the age group per se. Many great songs,few sucky ones.<br />She used to be good. Now she sings songs to 13 year old screaming fangirls about breakups and adolescent forms of unrequited love.<br />Track by track:<br />Tim McGraw-can't remember this one(and I own the actual CD)<br />Picture to Burn-LOOOOOOOOOOVEEEE it. Just don't like the fact that it will-inevitably- get stuck in my head for days on end after one listen.<br />Teardrops on my guitar-Beautiful song. Worth its \\"hit\\" status.<br />Place in this world-Every girls anthem.Lets face it. Isn't this what we're all trying to do? If we aren't we have.Or maybe we're going to sometime in the future.<br />Cold as you-Perfect breakup song. Its objective make that particular male feel like crap.Make us females cry our eyes out.<br />The Outside/Tied Together with a smile/Stay Beautiful-can't remember these(and I own the actual CD)<br />Should've said no-the equivalent message of Carrie Underwood's \\"Last Name\\" in my opinion.<br />Mary's song(oh my my my)-can't remember this one(and I own the actual CD)<br />Our Song-The one song on this entire album that I actually don't like.Cute but...don't like it.<br />Can't remember any of the songs after that.<br /><br />Have some of her newer songs on my ipod...BUT they're all covers.<br />All in all, I'm just another potential fan that she lost when she recorded the rest of her albums.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|The movie is extremely insane and sick. I only recommend it for people who like really extreme horror. Three college guys go to Europe and stay at a hostel in Slovakia where they are kidnapped and tortured. That pretty much says enough. And another thing. I don't know what EvilAngel007 mean't that this does happen, but the movie is made up. Eli Roth saw a Thai website that said you could shoot a villager in the head for 10,000 dollars. He said he didn't know if it's real or not. That inspired him to make the movie. There is no international murder market. That's for sure.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another solid Grisham Novel. Racketeer is a good read for a holiday weekend. Grisham is a consistently good writer of legal thrillers.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is the opposite of Angry Birds. You are helping the pigs (or should I say bad piggies) get map pieces that lead to the eggs. In the levels,you build machines to help the piggies get though courses. You may be traveling by air or land. This app is pretty good. Get it if you like building and problem solving.
B007HO392S|5.0|No. I don't live under a rock. This is just the first album of her's that I actually bought. I downloaded other tracks and was given some by a friend(off her music collection). This doesn't disappoint. Its a \\"Carnival Ride\\" ;) of fun and feeling.<br />So here's my track by track for you guys.<br /><br />Good Girl-Not my favorite. It was when it was a single but I rarely choose to not skip it these days. 2/5<br />Blown Away-in one word-overused as it may be-EPIC!!!!5/5 Definitely one of my faves.<br />Two Black Cadillacs-Wasn't initially a favorite. But it grew on me very quickly. An interesting tale of a man and his two ladies.4/5<br />See You Again-Memorable. 5/5<br />Do You Think About Me-Good but often skipped. 3/5.<br />Forever Changed-Good but often skipped. 3/5.<br />Nobody Ever Told You-Feeling down?This will cheer you up in a jiffy(though the peanut butter probably would too :))<br />5/5<br />One Way Ticket-Awesome fun/party/travel track. 4/5<br />Thank God For Hometowns-Pops up on my Ipod a lot. Not so memorable to others but still...4/5<br />Good In Goodbye-4/5<br />Leave Love Alone-\\"I just can't leave love alone. HEY!!!\\" Catchy,fun country song. Liable to get stuck in your head...I guarantee it. 4/5<br />Cupid's Got A Shotgun-Fun song. Good imagery.Did I mention fun?Yes. Will get stuck in your head,too. 4/5<br />Wine After Whiskey-Sad,breakup song.Gotta love it,though. \\"Wine after whiskey. It went from do anything for ya babe, to you don't even miss me\\" 5/5<br />Who are You-Definitely a love song.Semi-religious but not in an overly noticeable way. Another fave. 5/5<br />In Short: BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!<br /><br />Other albums(quick reviews):<br />Some hearts-Songs I know and love:Wasted,Don't Forget to remember me,Some Hearts, Jesus take the wheel,The Night Before (Life Goes On), Lessons Learned, Before he cheats, Starts With Goodbye, I just can't live a lie,We're Young And Beautiful(Shocking I don't own this,right??there's only 4 tracks I'm not familiar with)<br />Carnival Ride-Songs i know and Love:So Small,Just A Dream,Crazy Dreams,I Know You Won't,You Won't Find This, I told you so,The More Boys I Meet,Twisted. Don't really care for:All-American Girl,Last name(used to but it was a phase that too easily passed). And I don't know the rest.<br />Play on-Songs I know and Love:Quitter,Change,Undo it,Someday When I Stop Loving You,Songs like this,Temporary Home,Unapologize(an ALL TIME fave),What can I say(another ALL TIME fave). Okay songs:Cowboy Casanova,Mama's Song,Look At Me. Don't really know the rest.<br />Other of my songs:Hark the herald angels sing(She sings it REAALLY well)<br /><br />End of review.<br />Hope it helps you out a bit.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The first half of this novel tended to be slow-unlike previous Grisham writings.  The plot was little convoluted, hard to follow.  However, once I reached the second half, I couldn't stop reading.  I didn't want the story to stop! Overall, a great read-just persevere past the beginning.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|GREAT cast Looks like it deserves the attention it has been getting.<br />I will watch more episodes.  I recommend this.
B005HSL626|3.0|It's really fun at first,but after awile it get super boring. I got a high score of about 300 and then it was at the back of my Kindle Fire so I deleted it.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|Perfect fit lidle keeps it light weight feel  if it came with a holder for my stylus ***** hands down
B009AJDDQU|3.0|I've watched this movie several times and still can't understand the connection to the alien series.  This is a movie I'd relegated to background noise for those of us who need it.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The storyline took a long time to develop and in numerous ways it seemed like 90% involved the past and just how the leading character was wrongly convicted by an inept FBI . The general concept was don't trust the federal government or the police; hasn't the following been done a thousand times?<br /><br />What really should have been thrilling with the uncovering of the secrets it really wasn't that exciting or gratifying. Maybe it couldhave help if I connected with a character in the book. The climax ended up being clumsy and tried to be challenging, but wound up feeling unfinished.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is very fun and addictive. You are being chased bye evil monkeys though a twisting and turning temple. It's all about timing and accuracy. If you like action and adventure get this app.
B00A3OT34M|5.0|Really enjoy Pitbull's latest effort, but as I was listening to it I noticed words being censored.  I then discovered the uncensored MP3 for $2 more. I guess freedom of speech isn't free---it cost $2 more on Amazon.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I bought this for my 15 year old grandson and he and his 4 younger brothers all said they really enjoyed it. I get most of their birthday gifts at Amazon.com and they are always very thrilled.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Nevertheless, I gave it 3 stars since i didn't appreciate the great deal of profanity and graphic erotic descriptions which i believed were 85% of the time totally pointless for the story. I'm a smart person who enjoys a good story, but i just don't appreciate reading offensive things which were written with no purpose and therefore don't strengthen or improve understanding of the story plot. I am not saying saying that characters should always be wonderful folks and say great things. I simply don't see the purpose in further polluting readers' thoughts for no reason. It's absolutely possible to detail topics like adultery, rape, etc., without graphically explaining each step of it. The truth is, it requires far more energy and skill to make it work using this method.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00A9I264G Life of Faith]]
B005EGXTEE|5.0|read this before i saw the movie and loved it<br />every should read and then see the movie again<br />was awesome, highly recommended
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I won't be providing another long-winded review of a great ending to a great trilogy. I thought it important though to let everyone know that the Digital Copy for this film does NOT include iTunes - it is strictly Ultraviolet, which is a code word for we'll let you watch the film digitally... as long as we control the how you do part. That is enough for me to pass on this version and spend the same money on the boxed trilogy (and sell my individual copies of the first two films).
8866130931|2.0|I have been using Moleskine planners for several years, and always loved how they perfectly fit my needs - month outlines at the front and weekly pages mixed with blank pages for to-do lists, etc, for each week.  They seem to have re-designed this planner this year (2013), though, as it no longer has the monthly outlines at the front of the planner.  I've loved this planner in the past because it allows me to both look at the month at a glance, and write more detailed plans, and am very disappointed at the loss of this feature.  I would consider returning the planner, but I actually already exchanged the monthly planner that I ordered on accident (thinking it was what I had in the past).<br /><br />Additionally, the pages seem to have gotten thinner over the years which allows almost any pens I use to fade through to the other side.  I haven't yet decided if I'll even stick with this journal through 2013, or see if a friend wants it and look for something that better suits my needs and is higher quality.  Overall, I'm very disappointed in the changes that Moleskine has made.  I think that this will be the last planner I buy from them, unless they return to their older format and quality.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|By the time I saw this as a Netflix rental I'd read plenty of comments about it, many of them negative. Prometheus is a beautiful-looking movie, as good as any I've seen. The story, while basically a prequel to the Alien movies, is so full of illogical behavior by the characters in order to move along it is pathetic. You can see the nuggets of a good sci-fi tale here and there but eventually the movie is beat to death by an unrelenting bunch of smart people doing stupid things and getting killed by their idiocy. The 'oh duh' moments go on and on until all you can do is watch and wonder what the next blockhead is going to say or do. You have to wonder how it was released like this. Its really too bad. Its worth a look just for the visual splendor but there's no intelligent life on board the Prometheus.
B0091REZMW|5.0|i love this game. It is great ,entertaining ,addictive ,and fun I am sure you will love it. I loved it
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|It's a nice game with good graphics and story, but I'm frustrated that I have to pay $4.99 to unlock the full version.  I would have liked to have known that up-front before I started playing. $4.99 is kind of a hefty price for a game app and, since that info was buried, I feel like the company was trying to put one over on me. Not real happy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is to hard for little ones,  but fun to waste time while waiting for an appointment.  To many ads that little ones can hit. Games cost to much to unlock and some games to hard to manipulate.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is like the best calculator app there is my son use it for math equations that he need help with when I don't have time the only thing is if u need it to work some kind of science problem or some other thing I suggest buying the $0.99 version because the free version dose not have that kind of calculator. But in other words this is a good calculator app for math homework.
0761171703|5.0|Unique images of classical Dance with urban and rural America as it's back drop.  Jordan Matter's photography beautifully places stage craft into the street.  Great gift for any lover of dance, travel or good photography.
B006FYHTFO|3.0|The score is not nearly as good or coherent as the score from the first movie, but there are a few tracks worth picking up (\\"Die Forelle\\" and \\"To the Opera!\\"). It's not a bad score, I guess, it's just not as good as the first.
0345803493|5.0|Enjpyed entire series. Heard rumors there was too much vioence, but the games that were done in the &#34;playroom&#34; were consentual & much less violent that I expected. And the plot is great, moves fast, Loved the characters & the say they navigate and mesh their 2 opposite personalities to a perfect couple. Both so completely in love & can't believe how lucky they are to have the other. Very romanticbut with subplot that has elements of intrigue. Wish there were books 4, 5, & 6.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love it being based on the extreme wealthy. Acting is great, good twists to the story along the way, love the characters.
1416550550|5.0|I read this for book club and was surprised at how much I liked it.  Normally I lean toward books with a story that stays in chronological order, but once I got used to this one jumping around from past to present and country to country, I was able to really get into it.  I was weeping like a baby by the end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a nice app.  It has good functionality and is very easy to use.  I like the ability to recall my previous entries.
0345803507|5.0|Has great story line. Had heard a few people talk about how violet it is, but I read very few scenes where there was any extras in the &#34;playroom&#34; and non that were non consentual. Tastefully done.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book was very well written and very detailed concerning the science of his story.  I would have liked more detail about his actual heaven experience.
B0088X7YU0|4.0|I had alot of doubts about this because 1st its an animation movie, 2nd, starship troopers has gone down hill after the 1st one.<br />the 1st one is my favorite but this one just came in 2nd place. BY FAR MUCH BETTER THAN THE 2nd and 3rd.<br />The acting is actually very good, and the characters aren't flat but very unique. unlike the 2nd and 3rd there is alot of action and combat in this one and it sticks to the story line of the series. only thing im not a fan of is the change of uniforms and it could use some more of the federation politics in it. Just one thing i really wanted to see was the \\"Would you like to know more\\" (just something the die hard fans love).<br /><br />But i dont want to say anything about the story so i dont ruin it. But if your a fan of Starship troopers you will like this movie but it might not fully satisfy you and you might feel some more storyline is needed (you will see when you watch it)<br />If you have never seen any of the movies you will not enjoy this movie for the story since it completely relies on you knowing what Starship troopers is all about.<br /><br />Over all this is a 4 out of 5 but definitely the ranks 2nd among the starship troopers movies.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I've really enjoyed this game, and it's been a joy to play on my Kindle HD. Can't wait for the sequel.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|I like that I can write notes by hand and it keeps track of them.  However, I am not sure it is really worth $3.
0399245030|5.0|This is a sweet story with great illustrations. It made my husband and I both say &#34;Awww&#34; out loud when we read it.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|this show sends my bad boy fever in to overdrive. They picked a great cast. I love all the twist and turns.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I was shocked to see this movie doesn't get higher ratings as a movie. All 4 of my boys love it and its a great &#34;family&#34; holiday movie!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Book was an easy, entertaining read!  Enjoyed the interaction between the main characters, and the humor imposed by some of the football references.  Couldn't help but see the actors in the book characters. It helped because I like both people cast in the lead roles. Like I said, I'm looking forward to the movie now that I've read the book. I'm looking forward to see how they play some of the situations on screen.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I found it necessary to install this app on my kindle and it seems to work great. So far, I'm very satisfied!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this game sucks because after 1 day u have to buy the game booooo! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! because THIS GAME SUCKS SOOOO MUCH SO DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Not sure how much fun this game would be, I can't get past the second screen.  Crashes every time! Stupid.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I think it is too much for a simple game.  I wouldn't huh a full version but will finish out the free trial
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book. Loved this book more than 50 shades of Grey! It makes for some great reading!If you like 50 shades you will love this book even more.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|It would be really hard to pick out a favorite song from this album, especially as most of these are songs I've been hearing since I was a kid, and that have really helped define my appreciation for music. The new tracks are both enjoyable - \\"Gloom And Doom\\" written by Mick Jagger and \\"One More Shot\\" written by Keith Richards. I really like the almost time machine quality you get listening to these albums like listening to chunks of The Rolling Stones' career. I don't really have any complaints on this album. It is what it is - not new music besides the two new tracks, but instead a compilation/retrospective/greatest hits that spans the entire 50 year career of The Rolling Stones. The standard 50 track version of the album is absolutely worth the money, even though I bought \\"Forty Licks\\" a few years back. The 80 track version with all the extras I'm sure would be worthwhile for some of the hardcore Stones fans, but personally it is a little steep for me. The one major complaint is the cd-case design...what idiot marketing/packaging designer decided it was smart to have the cd-opening at the top so it can fall out if carry the cd-case downward??...as I did when opening the package! Most of the other cases open on the side so this won't happen.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Interesting read. Never is it told enough about the sacrifice of the men and women and most but not least the families of what they endure. Thank you to all the men and women that have made the ultimate sacrifice.... Semper Fi!!!!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|It's been a while since I got to play hunt and peck.  This looks like it will be fun.  Haven't had it long, so haven't looked at it too closely, but it seems like there are a lot of options to customize your playing.  Haven't read music in over 30 years so it should be interesting.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This really had promise in the beginning. It was obvious there was an Alien prequel factor but the visuals were great and the atmosphere almost like 2001 a Space Odessy for a while. Then when the bad guys show up it took a turn for the worst and degenerated into a monster chase with way too much re-use of the same devices employed in several films in the Aliens franchise. Damn shame really, it could have been great if the vision had held, if some of the mystery had held...and, if the last creature had been less obvious
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really fun app so stop hating you haters its flipping awesome so buy it its worth the money
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Right up the alley of refreshingly new music. Will definitely find a spot among my and many others favorites. Hope to hear more like this.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  The pace was good the story was compelling and the characters were well written.  I would highly recommend it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Omg I am a giagntic fan or the Mlpfim because are so flipping amazing and when this app came out I literally blew my top amazing must play!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very good book.  Predictable ending but Enjoyable and quick read.  Would recommend it.  There is even some humor in it.
0062127241|5.0|This book by Pete Townsend moved me it is honest and sincere, and will help others like me who have been on similar journeys.....Everyone who shares their personal story helps to validate the pain of others, this book represents a tiny grain of sand upon which Mr. Townsend will build an entire beach of successes..... thank you so much, one is never alone
B004LROUNG|4.0|good story line with a great deal of twists and turns to keep you interested.not quite the ending you expect
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I have been using this for a couple of years, now. I use it a little bit out of my phone. But, I plan to use it a lot more form my new tablet that is on the way.<br />The interface is simple and works very well. What else could you ask for?
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Despicable Me is a very hilarious movie.  I can not wait until the second movie comes out next year.  This movie keeps you laughning
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|seriously?  Rovio has outdone themselves yet AGAIN!  Bad Piggies is a strategic app that is well put together. The object of the game is to create a vehicle that will safley move the pig to a peice of the map that leads to the angry bird's eggs.the only glitch is that once you own a mechanic, with out using real money, the game doesn't allow you to use it. otherwise,  bad piggies is an outstanding game.
B008602KQI|4.0|The quality of course is great, great sound, amazing picture but...<br />Come on! The movie needed more violence! Part of what made the books<br />so great was the detail involved in the killing. Also, there were<br />a few \\"changes\\" from the book to the movie like how prim got the<br />mockingjay pin, but it always happens. All in all a great movie,<br />plus... Jennifer Lawrence! ;) I hope they do a little better<br />with the sequel, that way my review can change to a 5 star.
B0081BU42O|3.0|Enjoyable but not my favorite Culture novel, kind of dragged a bit in parts for me. In comparison to his other Culture novels I felt this one was amongst the weaker.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie was rented on a whim.  But I am glad I rented it because it turned out to be a great movie.  I cant wait until part 2 comes out
B005EGXTL2|5.0|These books are amazing it's hard to count how many times I cried. I've just finished the last one and I'm just about to start them again
B002RSDW80|4.0|I own this movie and enjoy it, but I have to admit I often fast forward through the \\"Julie\\" part.  I would have much preferred a full biography of Julia Child.  That is not the fault of Amy Adams, who does a marvelous job for the part of Julie.  But what interests me is Julia, not Julie, and Meryl Streep owns the part.  I give 5 stars to the Julia part and a generous 2 stars to the Julie part of the story.
0316226424|5.0|Loved the final book.  For those who think Bella didn't evolve, she is willing to die to bring her baby into this world and her strength to see this through was what finally endeared her to me.  I loved her ability as a vampire to shield others and absolutely loved the showdown with the Vulturi.  For those who cannot abide happy endings to bad for you.  Go read game of thrones and you will get your share of misery.  In conclusion best book of series for me by far.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Right up there with Grisham's other novels. Didn't want to put it down! The Racketeer rocks.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|I saw this movie several years ago and then it just seemed to disappear. I was recently looking for it because I wanted it for family movie night. I found it at the best price, as usual, on Amazon and bought it. I got the rental along with the purchase so we were able to watch it before I got the actual DVD. Thanks Amazon Prime and Amazon for all the wonderful things you do and all your great sellers!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was written with a unique style, as far as incorporating the past events with present day happenings. The character development was done well. As a reader, you wanted to keep reading to see what was happening and how the past had affected those actions. I loved the flower names and their meanings and the importance in the character's lives. I look forward to more books by this author.
B000T433CO|4.0|I'm a dude who kinda really actually enjoys this movie. There's some stuff I'm not super fond of, but overall- I really like it. One of my favorite chick flix.
B0091THRCU|2.0|Great case, fits perfect love the pull and clasp.  Ok done with the positives because the one negative is pretty big.  The stiching started coming undone at around a month of use.  As of today month and 4 days there is a large hole forming along where the stiching has pulled.  Really sorry that this case did not work well because it truely was nice.
1469984202|5.0|Don't ask,just buy,yes it is that good..best in fact I have read in many a year...must highly recommend to all..
B007OWRBJK|2.0|This book first of all is painfully long and drawn out with very technical music jargon related to electronics. I didn't understand much of this, and I have played in bands and love the WHO! Very little is done with Pete's personal life whch was rich with marital discord, and unfaithfullness,also childhood abuse that remains somewhat mysterious This is where the reader feels for Pete, but again this is brief.We learn nothing about his wife of many yrs., or his current partner who sort of appears in the book. It hurts to feel as though Pete is a real egomaniac.  . His drug and alcohol use is lenghly and described in \\"In and outs\\" of rehab without elaboration. Truely we learn his love for Roger and the sea... and his son. Little is said of his daughters who really were not in the Rocker's life much at all it seems.His charity work was impressive,and his talent fantastic, but we still don't know what makes Pete, Pete.
B008KE3960|5.0|Highly recommended. Very addictive. Fun fun fun. Able to play for free or if you want to progress more quickly you can spend cash for weapon upgrades.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a wonderful book, simultaneously about books, and secrets, about technology (all those young Googlers!) and ancientness, about the exciting new and the conservative old.  And it has a wealth of amazing and memorable characters, places, ideas, and things, but it's also modest about itself.  Read it!
B004P5ONZO|4.0|All I knew about Halo before reading this was the game title and platform. It's a good read and I<br />didn't feel as if there was missing information - it stands on its own. Not all game books achieve<br />that; I'm looking forward to reading Nylund's other Halo books now. The characters have depth in<br />this book and the Spartan program history unfolds at a perfect pace. Definitely find an edition with<br />the adjunct material.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Beautiful, funny, and soulful.  Visually a work of art.  Classic.  I would like to add this movie to my collection.  Loved it!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|John Corey appealed to readers who enjoyed DeMille' story telling and Corey's wry wit and smart alec comebacks.unfortunately, DeMille was not able to resist the temptation to resort to a formula to assure fans got plenty of what they like, at the expense of art.  The result was a decent story that could and should have been told in half the pages the author stretched it to.  Every page, I am not exaggerating, every page was crammed with, not only Corey's spoken wisecracks, but also his &#34;entertaining&#34; wiseass thoughts.  I was ready to punch the guy after the first 30 pages.  A real dissappointment from one of my most dependable authors.
0375869026|5.0|I do not call this a children's book only! I call it a \\"book for ALL ages\\"! I am 80 yrs old and consider it one of the most endearing books of the year. I will give it to my children and grandchildren and many friends! Thanks to the author and here's to many more of this calibur!!! It is truly a WONDER!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|One of the BEST Mitch Rapp books yet. Very timely with regards to Pakistan. Mr. Flynn is spot on once again.
B00961ZGQC|5.0|I still have a soft spot for pop tunes and this one does not dissapoint.  Carly, give us more like it.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Implemented this book across the organization and looking to find ways to implement it.  Very useful and well written.  Noted some case companies have since suffered financial problems.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|I have one word.......BORING!!!  Great actors, slow boring story.  I was very disappointed with such a great cast, I could not get into this movie at all.
B009E2WX3W|5.0|I hadn't listened to an album from start to finish in a long time...until I ordered this.  The remastered sound was great, and the music itself took me back to a happy place in my past.  If you remember this album, you'll understand.  If you're new to it, give it a try.  He is a very talented and gifted musical voice!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I love the irritable pickled Harry Hole. He seems to have super-human abilities to stay alive, beat up bad guys and detect nuances.<br /><br />I found this novel to be the most disturbingly realistic picture of alcoholism's cruel allure outside of nonfiction accounts I have read.Add to that the heroin addictions and you have a completely different \\"detective\\" novel.I have recommended it to readers who don't read \\"cop stories\\" because it's much more complex than who-dun-it.<br /><br />And I can't remember if I've ever wept copiously at the end of a crime novel. This was my favorite read among the fall crop of literary fiction.
B007T99ENE|3.0|The action is slow and nothing much happens. A lot of content is based on discussing other books which seems like a bit of a filler rather than substance. Having said that the style of writing is good and flows easily. I felt it needed substance; the little twist at the end wasn't enough.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|my son is only 2 and 1/5 but he loves doing these puzzles. he likes the mixture of trains, planes, and boats.
0061906220|5.0|Young children want to hear this story over and over again!  It's fun to listen to the author read to story on you tube.  My children have this book practically memorized!
B003ES5ZPK|3.0|I bought this assuming it would do 360 but it does not.  Just FYI if someone is looking for that.
B003LXSY60|4.0|I decided to buy this as my first Black Keys album after waiting so long to grab one. I was so indecisive as to which to start with but this was definitely worth it. I usually start with a band's first cd but I just can't stop jamming to this one. Totally recommend!!!
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|Stumbled upon this author and love her books. This is my favorite book by Kinsella so far, fun easy read.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Okay up front, the true shock value was set on Alien, Aliens 2 & 3 - after that.., the others are simply great story telling. Prometheus (for me) was a fairly outstanding movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Need to read.  I couldn't stop.  After reading 50 shades of gray this book kept my attention and was worth it.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Kinsella is so fantastic, love her leading characters. This is such a modern day fairy tale book and truly loved it!
B006VJMZXY|5.0|best book i have read in a long time i could not put it down philippa gregory is one of mt favorit s
B008458O3S|4.0|Trainyard is an entertaining diversion. I have enjoyed playing but after the recent update to Jellybean 4.2 on my Nexus 7 I only receive an error about unfortunately having to close immediatly after opening. I reinstalled, but no change.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very interesting and enlightening. Reads as vignetts of his experiences and thoughts.<br />I was hooked once i got started, it moves along rapidly and is hard to put down.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I am what is termed a \\"Pentaholic\\".  I have been following these guys since they formed for the Sing Off show which they won.  Then the family was able to go to one of their very first live shows and have loved all their YouTube videos, Tweets and online updates.  Their first EP album was fabulous (if too short) and now this Christmas EP has amazing arrangements of holiday classics.  I can't imagine anyone not liking it.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I saw Led Zep 3 times live in the 70s , the Page & Plant tour live twice and now this last re-union show DVD<br />and it awesome , love it .
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a nice collection of mini games. There are a lot of ways to earn points. Its great for a time filler
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I had this app on my android phone based on recommendations from many online reviews.  I was very pleased to see that it was available through the Amazon app store for my Kindle Fire since I was familiar with it and it has support for rooted devices as well.  I highly recommend this app as one that should be on any android device.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|five outta ten. seems like maybe a rookie / firstime author wrote it, kinda laves subject occasionally. there ARE good points however, and i will re-post when done..
B009SCRERI|5.0|Love this movie.  Watched it with my granddaughter and she loved it.  Have to say 1st animated movie I've seen since I was a little girl that I got that feeling of wonderment I experienced all those years ago.
B0091QS88K|3.0|This is a great game for children, wish they would make a more sophisticated version for teens/adults!  I love the actual cooking (cutting/frying) and that you can tilt the screen to move the butter around in the pan.
0783230079|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it. Now I can watch it anytime I like. Plus I love the music as well.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Another beautiful addition to the already beautiful collection of Taylor Swift records. She is definitely not slowing down her quality of hits anytime soon.
B0090X4HES|5.0|Great album I still jam this everyday a month later! This one of those special albums that comes every few years
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Both of my boys love this movie! If you don't already have get it now! Our family absolutely loves it!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I reviewed this blaster for my new blog: [...] My purpose is to give unbiased, impartial reviews of popular toys on the market. This is the Nerf: N-Strike Elite: Hail-Fire Blaster. This blaster comes armed with 4 Quick Reload clips and 24 Elite darts. The darts are fired with the help of a acceleration motor, which propels the darts to up to 75 feet. 4 AA batteries are required (but not included).<br />I had a great time with this blaster (as did the kids) and I can honestly say it is a LOT of fun. For kids under age 8, the blaster is a little heavy and awkward and hard to shoot, but for those 8 and up, it is easy to use. The only problem I encountered was with the acceleration trigger, as that It did not work on occasion. I learned that this problem was often caused by the advance handle and rotating clip mechanism being out of sync. Though there were a few times when the problem couldn't be resolved without some tinkering. Due to the extreme range, I suggest using the gun indoors. If used outdoors, be prepared for endless searching for missing darts! Indoors we set up targets (such as paper cups and plates) against the wall and fired at them, or, the kids just chased each other around the house! Either way...be prepared for some searching. For more information, including pics, check out my blog at [...]
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have to say this collection is simply great!! far beyond my expectations. The packing is just gorgeous, in a book format, with great pictures and that, simply perfect. Each disc contains two version of the movies, the original untouched, and the remastered version with new scenes, which I didn't know, and that's also a fantastic plus. The quality of the original version is what it should be, no so great, not so bad, just like an old movie, and about the remaster, I like the fact that still preserve that old look like, but looks definitely better. Nothing to say about the sound, which is great, but I haven't tested properly yet.<br /><br />The only disgusting thing about this collection is that requires and update of your player due to new AACS keys or something like that, wich sucks of curse, but hey, is not that bad anyway. I use two blu ray software players (totalmedia and powerdvd) and both of them, after the update, where able to play it without problems.<br /><br />Another thing that I liked about this version, is that you only have one short f@@@@n fbi warnning that, of curse, you cannot jump, and then you go right to the movie, unlike other blu rays were you have like one minute of crap that you have to brook.<br /><br />So, great collection, totally worth the money (especially 20 bucks that is what I paid)
B007KZY1YY|5.0|First book is sudden, this one is romance. I would recommend this to women AND to men without a doubt
B008RA3X5E|5.0|To me this is by far the best and coolest clock app at Amazon. Great looking, organized, and has the weather. Love it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game keeps me happy<br /><br />that's a good thing<br /> for me<br />the game makes you buy energy though<br /><br />that's jot fun
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I am such a big fish lover! The game is long an entertaining. Best app I ever bought.  I highley recommend this game for anyone who loves a good ghost story. I also would love to point out that the big fish computer games are fun too!
B0053O89IS|2.0|If you only care about having the 7th season episodes, then it's fine.  But considering the season was cut in half and the extras were pathetic, Fox should have charged only half the normal price for a season.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews. App works great. It has sq root and % buttons. If you need something more advanced then go pay for something better. I do agree with the reviewer who has an issue with the size. Other than that, it's worth the $0.00.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I didn't want to make this review. When a CD or DVD/Bluray from our favorit group o musician appears everybody runs to set 5 stars saying that the disc is wonderful. This is not objetive. If you check the discography of every group in Amazon you can see that every one of the disc has between 3,5 and 5 stars. Everything is OK for fans. But this is not the case, There are many differences (in terms of quality) between different records, even when they are from our favorits musicians.<br />I use to review only the discs that I don't like too much, because I think is unnecessary to add my vote to the pleyade of good reviews. But this is a exception. This Bluray is simply amazing. A fantastic outcome from Steven Wilson.<br />I have to recognize that I was going bored with the last proyects of Wilson. The new double Porcupine Tree CD, the Live Octane Twisted, is terrible, bad sound, bad picture, bored concert... but this one is fantastic.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I found this book hard to follow.  I was constantly having to look up the meaning of various words (many of which are not in the Kindle dictionary).  Might just be me...There are a lot of parallel tracks to follow in this book.  Went to see the movie thinking it would be easier to track on, but found it almost as confusing as the book.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|Unlucky me.  These pressings are incredibly noisy.  Shame on EMI for picking Rainbo, or whoever they're called.  I just processed a return for a refund-I don't want to take the chance of getting another lemon based on what others have experienced.<br /><br />I ordered the EU set from Amazon.co.uk. It ended up costing me $73.00 more, but if I get good pressings, it will be worth it. I just hope I don't get warped records like some people in England have complained about.
1575666286|3.0|I research this stuff for a living right now.. Years have been spent getting information... I have looked at this against research and I have found substantial current and legitimate scientific evidence that some of what is claimed is, in fact, possible. Although, I caution readers, that some do not turn around and it needs to be stressed. The cases that continue into progression are there, but without an actual study from legitimate institutions, an accurate turn around number is not available.  I am sad to say, more conclusive studies are needed on mechanism and effectiveness before everyone can soundly buy onto it.. Some research has been done to show other affective foods. Yes, please eat healthy. It can work for some. I encourage you to do your own research.
1451629184|5.0|Heart felt story. It's a horrible thing there are sick people out in the world like this. Must read again and again.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Ok, so We al loved it so much we purchased the move after renting it.  We watched it 8 times while we had it rented.  Very funny.  Great laugh for kids and adults as well.  Danny DeVito a total crack up.  Don't miss this one.  Great gift for the holidays and fun for the whole family to watch while spending time together.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Terminator 3-Rise of the Machines(released July/03)stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator,Nick Stahl as John Connor,Claire Danes as Kate Brewster,Kristanna Loken as T-X,David Andrews as Lieutenant General,and others.It is a rather ambitious film that has alot to tell,which is its main drawback.The first two by Cameron kept it simple and straightforward,which were its virtues.However,this one features the best S/FX of any of the Terminators,and as such reaches a level on a par with the first.<br />The story finds John Connor 10 years later from the last,a loner and continually on the move.His mother has died,thinking they had averted a global conflict with the machines.However,this is a Terminator movie and that is not to be.This time Ah-nold \\"beams\\" back into 2004 ,as does another advanced T-X model with enhanced capabilities.To add to that,it is female in form.She has been sent back not only to terminate John but his closest lieutenants and she sets about doing just that with the usual terminator proficiency.Ah-nold coincidentally finds John caged in a vet hospital by one of its employees Kate,who it turns out knows John and will become his closest associate in the future,not to mention his wife.At the same time the T-X has also arrived and is terrorizing the pair.John and Kate who,with Ah-nolds assistance,manage to escape.<br />They head to a memorial park where Sarahs body is supposedly interred.Ah-nold smashes the wall and pulls out the casket,inside of which is filled to the brim with weaponry,to which Ah-nold helps himself.It seems the USAF took over the Cyberdine systems research and now has the Skynet system up and running.Unbeknownst to the trio however,all satellite systems are starting to shut down.And the USAF are at a loss to explain the virus which seems to have invaded their computer systems and others around the world.The so called virus,is the Skynet system's own plant so the USAF would have to eventually let it take over control of every system in order to \\"repair\\" it.The USAF thinks it can control it,but Skynet has become too self aware by now and when Skynet is finally given control,it institutes the war of the machines against mankind by launching preemptive nuclear strikes around the world.<br />The trio come to the conclusion they must stop the Skynet system at all costs.At that they are ultimately unsuccessful,but they are directed to an underground facility north of the central one. There it is hoped that they will be able to stop Skynet once and for all.John and Kate fly a Cessna to the location and while attempting to gain access they witness the arrival of the T-X.Ah-nold arrives shortly thereafter and holds off the T-X until the pair can reach the underground facility.It turns out what they thought was their salvation and access to stopping Skynet was no such thing.They were sent to an underground location designed to protect officials from nuclear fallout;a survival bunker.They can do nothing but sit back and wait.After a while they start to receive radio messages from civil defense authorities across the country,and they realize there is now hope of humanity rising back up and fighting the machines.<br />It is an ambitious films with alot of nice moments such as the massive crane chase through the L.A.streets, with Ah-nold dangling on the end of it.There are funny moments such as when near the end the T-X arrives at the underground shelter ahead of Ah-nold in a  normal sized chopper.Then shortly after Ah-nold arrives,but his is the size of a Sikorsky.There are two or three times when Ah-nold tries to come out with some snappy comebacks,as from the last movies,which are now iconic sayings.Ah-nold says\\"Talk to the hand\\" and\\"She'll be baaack\\",referring to the T-X.None of them have the same memorable punch as the others did in the first two movies,and have been quickly forgotten.The film has much too much detail to tell and should have been kept on a straightforward line like the previous two;so it lost a little bit of ground there with my ratings.However what really gives this movies its' chutzpah,are the improved S/FX,far superior than the first two.It would be neat to see what they could do today with Ah-nold in a new Terminator film.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1.Extras abound in this two disc collection.There is commentary by all the main stars,a gag reel,featurettes on every aspect of the films making,both major and minor,right down to the video game and figurine off shoots.<br />All in all a nice return to the Terminator franchise.Ah-nold is on game,but the film just gets a little too busy and even Ah-nolds comeback lines don't pack the same punch as before.However the incredible improvement in technology helps hide alot of the films flaws.4 solid stars.so it lost a little bit of ground there with my ratings.However what really gives this movies its' chutzpah,are the improved S/FX,far superior than the first two.It would be neat to see what they could do today with Ah-nold in a new Terminator film.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1.Extras abound in this two disc collection.There is commentary by all the main stars,a gag reel,featurettes on every aspect of the films making,both major and minor,right down to the video game and figurine off shoots.<br />All in all a nice return to the Terminator franchise.Ah-nold is on game,but the film just gets a little too busy and even Ah-nolds comeback lines don't pack the same punch as before.However the incredible improvement in technology helps hide alot of the films flaws.4 solid stars.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Great movie.  Lot's of action scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Our whole family loved it so much we rented it 2 times, then bought the movie.
B009JNXK88|5.0|Really fun retro gaming. Reminds me of the good old days of video gaming. A whole bunch of fun. And it plays really smooth.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good book, was surprised that there is another one. Would of been good ending just the way it was. Will get her new one in May.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|Great read!<br />Made me think in a different manner about my \\"knee jerk\\" decisions. Trust them a little more and don't analyze things so much.<br />Gladwell was a little long-winded in some points, but overall was well written.<br />Would recommend for everyone of any age.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|I loved this watch for the month that it worked. It was exactly what I wanted until it broke. I would tel you to buy this item but it BROKE!!!! now I'm having to go through the tooth-pulling process of getting it repaired or replaced.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I like this series, it's a step away from my norm.  I did have some trouble keeping up with all the new tributes, but then again, they weren't around long....  I purchased the Mocking Jay even before I completed Catching Fire. I'm sad it's over!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|A very enjoyable album which shows off P2s writing and performing talents. When I buy a full album, I often only really enjoy a few songs, but even on the first and second listening, I've truly enjoyed nearly all of the songs.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed P2 on AI last year, hearing him sing his own songs is even better.<br /><br />And if you aren't tapping your toes to Gone, Gone, Gone......you're really missing out!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The author has taken quite a bit of review grumpiness but I liked it.  It's not the &#34;happily ever after&#34; type story that would have warranted a hearts and flowers ending....
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I've seen this movie three times and for the life of me I can't figure out what the heck it is about this movie that I enjoy so much. Is it the determination to live, the least likely people to survive do, the animals, the look of the film? Whatever it is I enjoy this movie enough to buy it.
0425263916|5.0|Expectations met and then some!  Just the right amount of &#34;the good stuff&#34; mixed with the &#34;real life stuff&#34; and the love story!  I love Sylvia Day's style of writing.  I can hardly wait for Entwined!!!!
B004GJDQT8|2.0|The ont size is unnaccepable.For people with bad eyes you need a magnifying glass.Make it more tablet HD ready. Thank you. Will change my score when its done.
0345803485|1.0|i am very uphappy with what i received i thought i was getting all three books that is what a trilogy is and what did i receive but the first book only. you deceived me even in the pictures it shows all three books.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|Was a Christmas gift but was a great movie.  I would say any girl would love to watch this movie :).
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Hero talks  too much about nothing.  Ending was disappointing and predictable .  Hero thinks he is funny and smart and ubbelievable
B009GESJH2|1.0|The only things worse than the sexist, right-wing idiocy, and moronic \\"patriotism\\" of Kid Rick are the people that actually listen to this guy. Stop, it is only making you more stupid.
B0002TT36G|2.0|I bought this item to put some trading cards in, and I've used Ultra Pro ever since I was a little kid so I knew I was getting a quality product. The binder itself is very sturdy and well made, but I am returning it as what I received does not match the picture. The picture shows \\"Collector's Album\\" which I liked since it is very general for whatever type of card you want to put in there.<br /><br />What I received however, said \\"Baseball\\" on it in big, bold letters. If I was putting baseball cards in it, I guess this wouldn't be a big deal. But either way, I did not get what I was expecting to or what I had paid for. If you don't care what it says on the binder, this is a great item, but if you do care, you may not want to order this.
B009E2WX3W|5.0|25 years already and still the best. if you are a fan of the best music, you should have this in your collection.<br />What an artist.<br />Totally recommended.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was gooooooooooooooooooooooood g d h h d u g j f h d b f h f b ..
B004KWVDWI|5.0|It had been years since I watched this film. Steve McQueen was one of my dad's favorite actors and it's easy to see why. Papillon is a great film that has stood the test of time and it gets a night transfer to blu-ray. The packaging is excellent, as I really like the &#34;book&#34; style case. The movie is sharp and clear and the details really shine through. Buy it!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett excelled again with this book. The amount of research that went into this effort was great . The characters were so believable. Hated to see the book end. This was a great book.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|Fun game. Good graphics. Controls work. No stupid permissions. Definitely worth it if you are into bike or motorcycle trials.
B0013F1D02|5.0|i ve seen this film in cine to be honest its one of the best film i ve seen in my life.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham needs to stick with fiction writing, his non-fiction books are garbage; he is very good at story-telling though! I do recommend this book.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Better than I had originally assumed it would be. Had some actors that I like so thought I'd give it a try. Was pleased to find it was actually quite good. I do feel, however, that there are some loose ends with the ending. Maybe they were keeping it open to the possibility of a sequel? Maybe not. Over all good though!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story takes several interesting twists and turns that keep you guessing as you go along.  A through and good read.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Mitch Albom does it again... produces another light, quick, enjoyable read with a nice message for our world. I hope you check it out!
B003AYMZO2|5.0|i am obsessed with this show.  i started watching season 1 about 2 weeks ago and am already finished with season 3. so many twists and turns and so much suspense.  i love it.  this season was my favorite so far.
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|This is currently my favorite CD in my collection!<br />The first time I listened to it, I wasn't exactly ecstatic about all of the songs in the album, but after listening to each a few times, I LOVE them all! Very catchy tunes, and definitely MIKA-quality songs.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|This is all about what if? then we discover just how bad that question can turn out. This movie was allot of fun with a few twists and turns but with enough reality T.V. which I detest to make this seem almost plausable from it's unprofessional mundane approach to super powered young people. Some how this odd combination just works.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is gorgeously written, and is one of my favorites.<br />It is a very relatable book, and can be enjoyed by a variety of audiences.<br />A few sexual themes, but nothing incredibly over-the-top.<br />I finished it in a day because I loved it so much!<br />Ten times better than the movie, for sure.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|One of the funniest, cutest movies ever for kids and adults alike.I have watched it over and over with my grandson.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book, kept thinking it would get better but it did not.kept kicking myself for paying 14.95 for it.
B00004RYZT|5.0|Rammstein does it again with another great concert. Their songs live are as good as on CD.They don't stop between songs and bs with the audience, so you get non stop powerhouse music! The CD and DVD are great!
B007ORVC36|1.0|Thank you Amazon for hosting this entirely impossible to watch LOW QUALITY stream. Now i will continue stealing this program as I have for the prior 4 seasons. F AMC and Amazon
B000003RCY|5.0|Even though this was their first album, it has some great songs it. Their sound has remained consistent, a lot because they have never had a change in group members.
B004LROUNG|5.0|One of Grishams  had a hard time putting this one down.hope to see more of David Zinc in future books
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Inspiring and believable.  Comforting. I'm not good with words, but this book confirms what I have always believed.  I will recommend it to my friends and family.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|First off I could go off about the price, because I had no idea how much it cost when I promised my daughter one.  But It is up to you whether the value justifies the price.  What I will talk about is product as if price was no object.  So you can take that and decide for yourself.  This is a fun way to do the advent calendar for any Lego enthusiast.  If you have a child that collects Lego sets this will excite him or her each day each slot is opened.  Nothing in this set makes anything huge.  But how could they be they have to fit in little slot.  But acts as a nice accessory set to lego play time.  This would the equivalent to buying a mega pack of Barbie cloths for someone's Barbie collection. From the Sith Santa to the ships.  This will make you child happy every opening.  We bought our as a reward chart.  So when it came down to having a clean living room or kids bed room we just couldn't put a price on that.  We split it up over several different choirs and we after felt satisfied with our purchase.  Now that the calender is empty our oldest child has been cleaning up after herself better.  Which was our main goal.  The novelty value is there. It just depends on what you feel personally that novelty is worth
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Ive never played Minecraft but this game sucks!! I couldn't figure out how to play it even when I looked at the directions ( witch there was barely of )!!!!!!! Do NOT get this app it sucks! I only enjoyed the part when I hit a wolf and its pack mauled.me...... But the game still ducks.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I remember playing Oregon trail when I was kid. this is an awesome twist on the old game and my kids love playing it too.
B0086700CM|4.0|This app is just a fun time burner that requires a bit of your attention.  Glad it was a freebie.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is very good. the graphics are good. wish there were more levels and special skills as well as weapons. overall very good especially for a free game.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|The BBC series Sherlock proved Doyle's character could translate to current times and reach new audiences.  Elementary proves the same thing in New York.  Sherlock Holmes has always been a nuanced and layered character and Johnny Lee Miller is very good at keeping him interesting.  Lucy Liu stuns and gives Watson more depth than the character has ever had before. Great fun and enjoyable.
B002APU580|5.0|After enjoying the Lizzie Bennet diaries on youtube (an updated version of this popular story), I just had to find out what would happen next since I don't have the book. I really enjoy seeing the actor who plays Darcy. We get to see him fall in lo, lov, love with her and see why because in all appearances she is nice to him. The actors/actresses in this film are phenomenal. The soundtrack is amazing and this film is a favorite that I even enjoy playing in the background while doing other things. I highly recommend watching it!
B009GEDP26|5.0|Odds were pretty much against the show when the principles gave in to their romantic attraction for each other as it's been the death of more than one popular show in the past. However, exceptional scripts by writers who not only know their craft, they love their characters--and actors who return the love with quality performances every episode--have added dimension and depth, enhancing a great show and exceeding the hopeful expectations of its fan base.
075666733X|4.0|I gave this 4 out 5 stars cause I am not really into the human body stuff, though the detail is great once again and text also.  If you are a medical student I would recommend this great book, or if not it is still a super coffee table book.  I liked the sections they had on how the body works.  I have not tried the DVD yet.

034580404X|4.0|I read Fifty Shades trilogy many times. I liked it a lot but only gave it 4 stars because some of the story lines ended to quickly. Almost like the author ran out of steam. I still read it many times. I'd be embarrassed to say how many times I've read it.  I really liked the characters of Christian Gray and Ana Steel. I had heard of bondage and S&M before but I really didn't have any idea just what it was. To say the least I was shocked. Never knew it was so involved in so many different ways. Ana sure got used to a lot of it. My concerns now are the cast choices. The author went into great detail about the looks of the characters. Most of the cast don't come close. Also the rumors about making only one movie instead of three. Impossible without making it to long. Very bad idea. Seems like the author doesn't know what shes doing. I can get past some of the bad writing but not a bad movie. One of the worst casting choices is the girl playing Mia. Another is the character of Jose and Dr Grey. I am losing I interest in the movie. Of course who knows when it will actually come out. Glad Charlie dropped out. Career breaker for him.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I have seen lots of people compare this series to the Twilight series, but since I haven't read that series, I have an unbiased opinion.<br />Grace has a fascination with wolves. This fascination leads to life changing events, love, and unanswered questions. I enjoyed this book immensely. The story line wasn't too deep, and it was an enjoyable read.

1936608618|5.0|Fully comprehensive, simple, easy to follow guide to running, cycling, and swimming methods - like nothing I've seen to date.  A must read for anyone that wants to improve their form and performance.  It includes how to deal with and prevent injuries.  The weight training is something that the endurance world is missing, building explosive power and enduring strength.  The nutrition chapters not only tell you what to eat but why.

B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle is one of my favorite shows on TV, and I am very pleased to have all the seasons in my collection of DVDs.<br />I've gotten the rest of the family hooked on this series, too. It's a delightful show, and I don't have to worry about the content being unsuitable for the younger ones. Also, I like watching the DVDs because there are no commercials!!!
0446580848|5.0|Like many others here. I stumbled on my first Nelson DeMille book, when :\\"the Lion\\" came out, I love mystery and intrigue, and  John le Carré used to be a favorite. I Loved ! the Lion ! and from there, I went back and read every Nelson DeMille book I could get my hands on (16) and just finished The Panther. His John Corey character is one of my favorites, but all his books are well written.<br /><br />The Panther Brings the John Corey character back. I love how DeMille Develops his plot, and makes nice bite size chucks to read, and of course with John Corey and Kate (the perfect marriage), it has me laughing while I read. Lots of action, and wondering what will happen next. With this series I dont want it to end...<br /><br />His Books have all been great, I just wish we could find someone who could transfer what is in DeMilles books, to the big screen. The Generals daughter was a good effort, but nothing compares to the books.<br /><br />I am always looking forward to his next book!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are so tight.  I will argue for these headphones against beats any day.  They are not plastic, well built, and most importantly have better, cleaner sound.  I bought these headphones looking for a comfortable set - all my previous ones would hurt my ears if I had them on for a long time.  No question that these are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn.  I would most definitely recommend these to anyone who asked.

0307730697|2.0|I have the utmost respect for our military, and truly believe that each and every member deserves a solid pat on the back for their sacrifice.<br /><br />I also believe that Adam Brown was a man that separated himself from the pack through his sheer determination and inner drive.<br /><br />That said, I got lost somewhere around his sixth or seventh relapse with crack cocaine. Everyone has their demons, but to have your left hand say \\"this guy was the best\\" while your right hand says \\"whoopsie, there he goes again dragging his family, friends and brothers-in-arms through the s*** of his substance abuse\\" just made me scratch my head. Maybe I just have zero patience for substance abusers. Maybe I should've looked past his indiscretions and thought \\"even the mightiest sometimes fall.\\" But over and over and over again? I don't get it.<br /><br />Honestly, the one thing that stuck with me about Adam Brown was the story about wearing his life-jacket while with friends because his mom told him to.
0545425115|4.0|As a young adults' novel, this first book of a trilogy lays bare the brutality of human nature in a dystopian world - disturbing because the setting is at once recognisable (in a futuristic nation Panem, North America) and alien (where children from each of the twelve districts are offered as \\"tributes\\" to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games, as a reminder of the rebellion against the Capitol), which adds to the horror of the events depicted.<br /><br />That the protagonist, Katniss is a typical (if feisty and resourceful) teenager battling both hormones and affairs of the heart in the midst of a more life-threatening reality-gameshow-gone-macabre arena where she has to kill 23 other teenage \\"tributes\\" in order to stay alive, immediately sets this work apart from other teen novels. The premise is not entirely new though, and reminiscent of Japanese cult novel \\"Battle Royale\\" (also made into a movie), published some 10 years before \\"The Hunger Games\\". In the earlier work, a class of senior high school students are whisked to a remote island to battle to the death as a practical way of addressing the problem of teenage delinquency.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" captivates because Collins does not shy away from addressing larger issues like poverty, war and tyranny, while making something as morbid as the Games seem probable within our culture of fascination with violence and spectacle. A sobering read.
1936608618|5.0|This is a true innovator in the endurance world. An absolute must for athletes and coaches unscared of trying new ideas.<br />-The content is written very well (I will be able to dip in and out of each section with ease).<br />-There are quality pictures showing the reader exactly what the author means (in this case a picture shows a thousand words X20!).<br />-This explains the full package an endurance athlete needs (skill, mechanics, intensity then volume, restoration, mobilization, strength, conditioning, nutrition, hydration) which makes it worth it's weight in gold.<br /><br />I recommend every coach read this and get their athletes to read it too.

0547884591|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moGXEGUAWUSH2V]]Do not let the size of Tim's latest book deter you.  Yes it's as big as an encyclopedia but it's also as useful and structured as such.  In fact, like his last book, it's more a reference that you can jump to the parts that interest you most.<br /><br />All of Tim's books have been inspirations for me.  The 4Hwork week inspired me to start my business, the 4hourBody was a major inspiration behind the program inside this book [[ASIN:B0093DO7MM Train Your Taste To Trim Your Waist: A Simple Method To Love the Food That Loves You Back]] and now Tim's latest book is an amazing tribute to food, life and learning.<br /><br />As a health, fitness and nutritional expert, I have found myself disagreeing with certain aspects of Tim's methods (or explanations) of them in the past, but for the most part I love his approach to experimentation, life and bio-hacking and determining what works best for you.<br /><br />First, what I disliked:  The name of the book.  It's actually misleading.  Although innovative recipes and methods of cooking seem to comprise the majority of the content, there are a lot of non-cooking related topics that are equally as useful.  A more apt title might be The 4-Hour Jack of All Trades With A Specialization In Cooking Cool Stuff.  Ok I know that's a terrible title, but the book conveys so much more than cooking.<br /><br />I'm a huge learning-addict, so the \\"Meta Learning\\" chapter was what I jumped to first.  That's a smart idea because there's a lot to \\"digest\\" in this book.<br /><br />Next, I jumped to the Sexy Steak chapter because that had one of the most alluring names obviously.<br /><br />Now, I'm a big proponent of Juicing Vegetables...but I have to admit, a good grass fed steak is an awesome treat and I look forward to using Tim's recipe...including the Pine Pollen...which for reasons I won't be discussing on this review is already on order :)  (read the book to understand why.)<br /><br />How to use this book for maximum effectiveness?  Keep it handy in your kitchen or coffee table.  Flip to it when you're bored or want to try something new.<br /><br />Most importantly, try out the recipes, learn something new and give life a new flavor.  After all, that's what I think Tim's work is really  about...adding spice to life and finding new, exciting ways to live it.<br /><br />I look forward to finishing your book Tim...or most of it at least.  (And no, I don't regret having bought the physical book for 4x the cost of the kindle, because I might need to use it as a survival weapon)mum effectiveness?

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is an excellent choice for after market cooling. I am relatively new to the game of overclocking rigs but have found this cooler to be much more capable than my last cooler (don't remember the name but it had a big Z on it). One thing I noticed is that at idle the biggest factor to how cool your CPU will be is ambient room temps. If your room is hot then don't expect your CPU to be all that cool (found this out after 3 different coolers used). However, if you have a relatively cool room like maybe &#34;room temp&#34; +- 2° C then this cooler will work wonders for when the pushing gets tough. My overclocked 3.6ghz q9650 stays under 65° C while stress testing for half an hour with prime95. I can and have pushed my cpu to 4.0 ghz but I don't need the added heat in my room and higher electricity bill. All in all this is a great cooler.
0547884591|5.0|In the past (4hr Body/Workweek) Tim has helped me gain muscle, lose weight, master travel, and reclaim precious time.<br /><br />Yes, this book is called \\"The 4-Hour Chef\\", but really (IMHO) one of the most valuable sections of the book teaches you how to rapidly master anything, one of Tim's trademark skills.<br /><br />In other chapters you'll learn how to cook anything (and when I say anything, there is a section on cooking tasty squirrels), forage, hunt, and much more. This book is a fun read, non-intimidating, and you'll walk away with a bunch of new skills to impress your friends with.<br /><br />Enjoy! More greatness from Mr. Ferriss, congrats Tim!

I have to say Amazon has come up with a great product here. The three different size tips was a very nice surprise.<br /><br />I would recommend this product for anyone needing a stylus for a touch screen.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|I'm not sure how the whole religious exploration that made up the beginning of the book tied in.  I guess it's purpose was to demonstrate the strength of faith.  The middle of the book was dedicated to the main character's, Pi's, hellish ordeal as the lone human survivor of a shipwreck which is made even more arduous by his companion, a 450-lb. Bengal tiger.  Although everyday is fraught with challenges for Pi, it was also fraught with monotony.  The life of a castaway in the middle of the Pacific Ocean lacks variety and so did this book.  The ending was the only interesting part as it made me question the power of the mind and the spirit's will to survive.
B001B51B9M|5.0|Be warned that The Music Man is my all-time favorite movie. This review is really about the quality of the Blu-Ray disc. My husband and I were both blown away by the richness in color and the fine details we noticed e.g. clothing details, and clarity of background items. The movie just jumps off the screen. We have a new Samsung 55 inch TV and this movie is just overwhelming! Combined with the nostalgia, cast and super score, one just can't complain at all about this presentation. I'm sure other aficionados will also appreciate it as well. I would recommend that younger folks also take a look see....a break from all of those super special effects is worth it. Kick back and enjoy one of the greatest movies ever made!

B009A9BF5G|3.0|With this being their first major concert video release in almost ten years, I was expecting greatness.  I was disappointed.  The blu ray disc would not play on one of my machines that is three years old, but it did play on another that is one year old.  The crappy video and audio production could not disguise the fact that it's a recording of one of the greatest rock bands of their generation.  As such, this DVD will probably be good enough for their millions of fans around the world.  Sadly, on the global scale of concert videos, it's pretty poor.  The video editing is junk, with just a bunch of quick takes of the flashiest particular moment, and no artistry.  The audio quality is okay, but not exceptional.  For comparison, I would consider the audio quality on John Mayer's \\"Where the Light Is\\" to be exceptional.  This DVD doesn't even come close to that.  So for die hard Coldplay fans, might as well go ahead and buy it.  It's a documentary of a great band at the height of their musical powers.  If you're not an avid Coldplay fan, this set isn't likely to turn you into one.  The thirty dollars would be better spent on three of their audio CD's - doesn't matter which, that's up to your personal taste.  X&Y was my favorite.
1402217722|3.0|While I have been a fan of Georgette Heyer since the mid-1960's, I can honestly say I did not enjoy this book very much as the main character, Horatia, is just too immature, silly, and plain annoying. I found myself wondering over and over again why the Earl would put up with her. Perhaps my dislike comes from listening to the audio version of the book, I don't know.  Over the years I have read many of Heyer's books and know she is a wonderful author, but I doubt I would've liked this character even when I was a teenager like Horatia. Like another reviewer said: Read this one for the hero(the Earl of Rule)!

0060555661|5.0|This investment book is written by Benjamin Graham, originally written by 50 years ago. He taught Warren Buffett. During the reading, I was really enjoyed the investment and financial ideas sharing by the Author. The central Idea that I got from this book is that an Index Stock Fund outperforms other equity funds on a historical basis. And sometimes it outperforms active investing too.  For each chapter if the reading, I could easily caught up the mainly important and useful concepts.<br /><br />I believe I learnt a lot though this book. For example, Investing promises Safety of Principal and an adequate return by thoroughly analyzing investment opportunities. Investing may be contrasted to Speculating. Speculation includes any activity that unduly risks principal. The Investor and Inflation states that there is no close time connection between inflationary conditions and the movement of common stock earnings and prices. Stocks are not a guarantee against inflation. The investor must never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past. This includes the corollaries such as forecasters who argue that stocks have returned an annual average of 7% after inflation ever since 1802. Besides The defensive investor is one who does not want much risk and does not want to work very hard, make a lot of decisions.  As previously stated, the defensive investor's portfolio should consist of no less than 25% high grade bonds and no less than 25% large stocks. Common Stocks offer protection against inflation and provide a better than average return to investors.  This higher return results from a combination of the dividend yield and the reinvestment of earnings (undistributed profits), which increases value. The argument for common stocks--they offer a considerable degree of protection against inflation and a higher average return to investors over the years. These two benefits of common stock investments are lost if too high a price is paid. Rules for common stock investment are that there should be adequate but not excessive diversification, each company should be large, prominent and conservatively financed are each company should have a long record of continuous dividend payments, [Zweig suggests 10 years continuous payments, or maybe even 20.] and investor should limit the price paid to not more than 25 times average earnings for the past 7 years and not more than 20 times the last 12 month period. The Enterprising Investor does all the work he does to obtain a slightly better investment result. Growth Stock approach means every investor would like to select the stocks of companies that will do better than the average over a period of years. Investment funds have tended to do better than the average individual investor. Funds have generally done no better than common stocks as a whole (and the cost of the funds hits their performance for the investor). Zweig said most funds underperform the market, overcharge their investors, create tax headaches and suffer erratic swings in performance. \\"Buying funds based purely on their past performance is one of the stupidest things and investor can do.\\" There are five determinative factors to determine the price for an investment. First is to general long term prospect. Second is to quality of management. Third is to financial strength and capital structure. Fourth is to dividend record. Fifth is current dividend rate. Two investment approaches are investment by prediction is a fool's errand, and investment by protection is best -- protection from overpaying for a stock and overconfidence in your own judgment on quality of stock. The goal is consider possibilities and means for the investor to make individual selections which are likely to prove profitable--above average. The Graham-Newman method is about description of various value investment concepts such as arbitrages, hedges, purchase of companies for less that net current asset value, secondary companies etc.  It is better for mostinvestors to just focus on companies with low P/E multiples. This is a message Graham continuously repeats throughout the book. Zweig does a good job of summarizing this: \\"If you buy a stock purely because its price has been going up - instead of asking whether the underlying company's value is increasing. Graham is a big supporter of shareholder activism, urging shareholders to demand explanations for poor results, and to support the removal of poor managers. Many shareholders fail to be active enough, but Graham says this is alright, because a new mechanism has been created to do the same thing. Graham is referring to the market for corporate control.  Companies with poor management may have poor valuations, which make them targets for acquisition. This is good for investors who will see a control premium added to their share price upon acquisition. For the last concept, \\"Confronted with the challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto, MARGIN OF SAFETY.\\" Not overpaying for a security just because it is the latest market darling. Key points are buying good companies that are undervalued, diversifying across multiple companies and industries, having a portfolio that is both bonds and stocks and reviewing the allocation at regular intervals , having the courage to buy even when the market is saying something else, having the courage to ignore the daily market fluctuations and hold on to the investment until the underlying fundamentals change, and recognizing that it is better to be safe and careful than to take risks in an effort to earn above-average returns.<br />After I read this book, I have more knowledge about the investment about the common stocks and how the compare between the inflation and investment. I'm glad I read the book. It gave me perspective on how the market works, though I'll still stick with diversity over value, especially since I invest almost entirely in funds. He did not have to scare me off onindividual stocks, but he did convince me to do more homework and to try to be more business. Besides, It is very useful for us. We can know how much interest can beat the inflation. Then we can choose how much money we can put in the portfolio and the save in the bank account. And I would really recommend this book to the future potential reader. I believe this book will impress you.

B009D5VNLS|4.0|I wish I could say I got to see most of it, or even half of it.  For me, it is a pet peeve, when movies are made to be seen in total darkness (i.e.. in a theater.)  Such movies do not translate well in a home environment ..... unless watched without any lights on, and with black-out curtains.<br /><br />I do not always sit, inactive, on a couch to watch TV.  I like to watch movies while working on crafts, or other activities in my home office.  Turning off all the lights sort of inhibits my ability to multi-task in this way.<br /><br />I've grown to expect bad lighting in live action movies, but with animation........?  That's just poor crafting on the part of the artists and producers.<br /><br />Wise up, people (movie creators)!  If you intend to rake in extra revenue in after-theater sales of DVD's and Blue-Ray, at least make them viewable.  I turned off every light in my room, so I wouldn't be watching the bookcase reflection from behind me, and craft light on my desk; and I STILL ended up just listening to the dialogue while staring at my own face reflected from my monitor (Amazon Instant Video.)  I certainly don't want to pay to see a movie, and get the dubious pleasure of watching my annoyed self squinting/straining to see what was happening, on screen.<br /><br />Mine is a review of the 'product', not the story or acting (voices.)  In the review instructions, Amazon states, \\"Reviews must contain at least 20 words about the PRODUCT.\\"  Don't get me wrong, I thought the story was very sweet, and had an enlightened, but not illuminated, message (earning my 4 stars.) To be fair, I did not want to bring down the average for the overall rating, just because I was not watching in an ideal setting.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and now own the Blu-ray. This is a great movie and sheds some light on how the Aliens came to be and also opened up a whole new question. Who are they? If you love the Aliens and love the whole idea of where/why are we from/here. This is a must see...................
0316187216|5.0|The Bloody Nine has fast become my favorite Fantasy character, but he is, by no means, Abercrombie's only brilliant creation.  Every one of his character's erupts raw, unflinching honesty.  Abercrombie is a true artist who just happens to have graced the Fantasy Fiction Genre with his tallent.  This level of character development and story telling is hard to find in any genre.  It should be noted that this book is fit only for mature readers... in every sense.  There are (#1)no set formulas followed, (#2)no cliches, (#3)no pulling of punches, (#4)no happy endings, (#5)no sappy love interests, (#6)no good guys, (#7)no bad guys, (#8)no glossing over the very human flaws of each character, and of course (#9)no lack of blood.  Now... if only he could write faster.

B0039TD7RC|5.0|I love this set of cds it captures the true Rolling Stones I like.  The bluesy gutsy music.  It is worth the buy if you are a true Stones fan and remember their early days.  GREAT
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Very cute movie. The whole family enjoyed watching it. Would definitely recommend it if you are a Dr Seuss fan.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I like the case just fine, especially for the money, but the screen protector doesn't fit the 4s well.  There is almost, but not quite enough space for the front camera hole and the bottom home button holes to both line up.  One of them will be off.  In my case the front camera hole was blocking the camera view and you could see a shaded area on the screen where it was blocked.  Even without it the case is a good buy.  Will have to wait and see if it yellows as some have said.

B007EJ6S92|5.0|No mere mortal words can give it justice beside to say its up there with the best like Cradle of Filth, and Dimmu Borgir ! That should be Enough said ! Done and Dusted ! ; )<br /><br />Will Deffinitely keep on buying their records, and will allso now start trying to get hold of their previous ones as well in case its as good or close to it<br /><br />No bad track I can think of at all, but I must say I would like future records to be a bit longer than just like about 40 minutes ? Makes me feel a bit cheated out of my hard earned money. However the quality of what Is there makes up for it ; )

B0041KVW2K|1.0|A September 27 posting by the Beatles on their Facebook page indicates that this box set is limited to 50,000 worldwide.<br />Furthermore, at the Beatles online UK store, the box set is being marketed as \\" limited to 50,000 copies worldwide.\\" HOWEVER, when you go to the USA store the box set is being marketed as being  \\"limited to 64,000 copies worldwide.\\"<br />The Beatles pulled this scam with the mono cd box set.  I paid for that one at a premium because I thought I had a limited window of time with which to purchase.  Soon after the price plummeted - doesn't appear if it was ever \\"limited.\\"<br />Is this box set really limited or an unlimited production - we'll never know because they keep changing the numbers.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|As a creative development advisor who works with profoundly original and highly introverted artists, writers, directors and innovators, and as born introvert, I was delighted to come across, Quiet, Susan Cain's excellent book.  As a self-professed introvert, Cain explores the lives, challenges and contributions of introverts living in an extroverted society with candor and color, wisely blending research findings, personal anecdotes, and in the latter part of the book micro-scenarios that explore problems and solutions with which introverts and their extroverted partners must contend.  Her even tone, careful explication of research findings, and her analysis of the inner world and expressive challenges faced by introverts, mirror her illustrations of the means by which introverts can speak up with confidence and power in negotiations, sales situations and public fora.  In this important sense, she demonstrates subtly, as she puts it, \\"The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking\\"<br /><br />As the author of [[ASIN:B008MQANA6 Intentional Practice & The Art of Finding Natural Audience: A Framework for Artists and Professionals (Intentional Practice in the Arts and the Professions)]], a short book  that helps introverted artists and professionals negotiate the waters between the Scylla of dysfunctional diffidence and the Charybdis of shameless self-promotion, I much appreciated the pitch and tone of Cain's discussion of how introverts can find ways to express their ideas in public, and build the relationships they need in order to thrive in their work.  Her thoughts on these matters and the basic framework she provides offer sensible means by which introverts can engage the world without burning out.<br /><br />The value of Cain's simple and practical advice cannot be overestimated.  Introverts struggle mightily with identity issues, and a capable author who validates their struggle, and encourages them neither to hide, nor to ape extrovert values, but totake practical steps to meet the world in a way that is sensible and rewarding to them, is terribly important.  That said, the author does not acknowledge or explore the profound pain and difficulty that comes with the choice to venture out, to be seen, and to be heard, nor does she speak to the means by which introverts can come to grips with and surmount the challenges of meeting the tasks she has set for them.  I see this less as a defect of the book and more as an opportunity to open a dialogue about the means by which introverts can confidently come to engage, enlighten and enjoy those around them.  Cain beautifully illustrates what it is like for a gifted introvert to arrive at this place with her closing story about her grandfather, the Rabbi in Brooklyn, and her family life gathering to read together.  In many ways, I wish the she had begun the book with this warm and loving tale.  Well done and well worth reading.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|i really enjoyed enigmatis. I couldn't  put  it down. Waiting patiently for Engimatis 2!<br />Engimatis is a must have game!
B005LAII08|4.0|Impressive at Brave was on the big screen, there's something intensely dazzling to see it in Blu-ray. The almost infinite details fill every millimeter of the home screen.<br /><br />Brave is a sweeping epic tale, but it's also an intimate examination of mother/daughter relationship. Although I enjoyed the film and saw it twice in theaters, as a dad and husband, I found the scene in which Merida gives her mother something to ingest that could be extremely harmful or fateful, is kind of difficult to take. Merida then snaps into denial of wrongdoing, which pushes more than a few buttons.<br /><br />But I'm not a Mom or a daughter. When I saw the film with two sets of each, they resoundingly loved the film with absolutely no reservations. Being mothers of teen daughters, they each agreed that of course, the girl would be driven to risk anything to make her mother change, not considering the consequences and, yes, not owning up to it.<br /><br />How Merida does face the impact of her actions, the fate of the kingdom, and her parental issues, is the heart of Brave, and what you must experience from beginning to end. Few films, animated or not, take a character through such a character arc in such a plausible, believable way. The Brady Bunch this ain't.<br /><br />The magnificent score by Patrick Doyle is as epic as the film, and the voice cast is ideal. Pains were taken to make things as authentic as possible, as evidenced by the bonus features.<br /><br />And what a feast of bonus features there are, at least on the Blu-ray. The DVD does contain the audio commentary (thank you!) and two short films, but depending on which Blu-ray set you choose, you get a lot of cool stuff.<br /><br />Basically the 3-disc \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" includes everything that the 5-disc Disney/Pixar's Brave: The Ultimate Collector's Edition does except for a Blu-ray 3-D disc and a digital download disc.<br /><br />Here's are the bonus features:<br /><br />DISC ONE / FEATURE FILM<br /><br /> * Audio Commentary<br /><br /> * Short Films<br />  1.

B004J4WN0I|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a lot.  I particularly enjoyed the relation with the dog.  But I must admit that I like the Harry Dresden series better.  I am giving this 4 stars because I would be willing to buy the next one in the series.

B008UFUOH6|5.0|I was not familiar with Tracey Thorn.  I bought this album on a whim.  It was a good whim.<br /><br />This record is the perfect antidote when you are going crazy from hyperactive, twinkly, jingly Christmas music.  It's like taking a short vacation to a quiet place.  Tracey's voice is warm and soothing, the arrangements are understated and perfect. I particularly like the instrumentation on River.  Someone decided a few years ago that this was a Christmas song, and now everyone has it on their holiday album.  It's not an easy song to sing, and some artists fail to connect with the emotion of the song.  Thorn hits just the right note of ruefulness, and the simple French horns in the background are poignant.<br /><br />The song choices are uniformly excellent.  Most of the songs are not well known, although they have been recorded by other artists.  The two original compositions, Joy and the title track, are little gems.  Really, I am so thrilled with this album and so excited to discover Tracey Thorn's other music.  Highly recommended.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I know I am way out of the popular view of this book.  It is way up on the best seller list, but I found it very boring and stopped reading half way in the book.  It was just talk, talk, talk.  Maybe the second half would have been very good, but I will never know.  I have so many other great books to read, I just don't waste time on duds, and , sorry, folks, this one was a dud to me.

B008QTV3X0|4.0|A friend of mine mentioned that I should check this show out. Didn't really expect much, but what I found was an excellent mix of action and drama that really sucks you in. Some of the issues surrounding Carrier are a bit far-fetched, but they lend an overall dimension to this show that is hard to argue with. The middle part of the season was a little slow at times, but it picked up in the end and really through some curve balls. All in all a very worthwhile show!
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I ordered this book after hearing that the movie was complex and hard to follow.  Turns out it's simply following the style of the book.  Story line was very hard to follow and not all that captivating.  Sorry I spent the money on this one.

0790729628|2.0|As of this writing, according to votes awarded, \\"The Most Helpful Review\\" on Amazon.com for this movie is by a person - Steffan Piper - who claims this is the greatest movie ever made. I feel exactly the same way about Walt Disney's production of \\"Pinocchio\\" - in my opinion, \\"Pinocchio\\" is the greatest movie ever made; it's just that it may take a few centuries for the world to fully appreciate it, as with this classic, \\"Blade Runner\\".

B0087ITC56|5.0|Chances are you will not see this film as your in-flight movie the next time you fly the friendly skies. And for good reason, too. The opening sequence includes perhaps the most hair-raising plane crash scene ever, so spectacular that even if you know what to expect, that won't prevent you from crushing your popcorn box from the tension of it. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />At the wheel of the stricken jet is Captain William \\"Whip\\" Whitaker (Denzel Washington) who pulls off a landing only less miraculous than the real life exploit of Chesley Sullenberger who landed his own craft in the Hudson River in 2009, losing not a soul aboard. There is one major difference however. Whitaker is both drunk and stoned when he is piloting the craft although his condition is not the reason the airliner malfunctions.<br /><br />It is the twin truth, acknowledged by all involved (including the viewer,) that Whitaker is both a self-centered alcoholic AND the only pilot with the chops that could have saved the 96 passengers on Flight 227. However, six others perished, including a crew member with whom he was having a fling with, and so the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is called in to investigate.<br /><br />Despite his heroics, Whitaker is under suspicion for the high level of alcohol found in his system and the two empty vodka bottles retrieved from the airliner's trash compartment. It having been a non-beverage service flight, only the crew is suspect although we had seen Whip empty them into an orange juice container right before the airplane lost control.<br /><br />As Whitaker waits for the NTSB hearing that will either clear his name or place him in prison for manslaughter, the audience is torn between sympathy and revulsion. Sympathy because he did indeed save the plane and revulsion because he is a classic addict, living a life encumbered by lies and excuses.<br /><br />What transpires at the hearing and the night before is the watershed moment of both the movie and the life of Whip Whitaker.  The subsequent ending, based on what transpires, contains an ambiguity that is both justified and satisfying.<br /><br />Washington is flawless here, his acting abilities never put to better use. He is ably aided by John Goodman (as a jolly scenery-stealing drug pusher), Don Cheadle as his hard-pressed lawyer and a sweet turn by Kelly Reilly as the waif-like heroin addict who is Whitaker's moral conscience. Melissa Leo appears at the finale in a somewhat muted role as the main NTSB investigator.<br /><br />In conclusion, there are many movies out this holiday season. \\"Flight\\" is worth the hype as long as you aren't about to board an airliner to spend Christmas with your far-off relatives.shed moment of both the movie and the life of Whip Whitaker.

B009E3EYS8|5.0|The Zeppelin 'one and off' was the most brilliant move in rock and roll history, it even felt like Peter Grant organized it. Jason Bonham is 'dead' on and Page is loose. Plant is amazingly strong and Jones still has the touch. It's a moment that will never be repeated. And yes, Zeppelin are the master marketeers of the past 50 years, it's the music that won't be silent.

B004H1YH66|5.0|I loved the original Conan soundtrack.  The sweeping highs, quiet lows, the gentle, mournful quality of Wifeing.  The soaring Civilisation theme.  The score brought the Hyborian Age alive, on the screen.<br /><br />This Extended Soundtrack includes all the music from Conan the Barbarian.  I loved it even more.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour, buy this soundtrack.  Immerse yourself in it.  Travel to the Hyborian Age, with Conan and company.

0547884591|5.0|What is a \\"Keeper\\" (in books that is...) A keeper is a book you read once, maybe twice, then put it in a drawer, on a bookcase, or in the kitchen and pull it out to refer to often...<br /><br />Most books you read once, maybe twice if they're real good, then you donate them, throw them in the recycle bin, or give 'em to a buddy. Tim Ferriss's \\"The 4-Hour Chef\\" is not one of those books. After savoring the content, and re-reading numerous times...you'll find yourself going back to it over and over. It's a rarity in books but Tim hits it on the head in this book!<br /><br />The book is THICK, 672 pages to be exact. At Amazon's $21 dollar price, it's only .03 cents a page! Whaaat!!...see, it is a bargain..<br /><br />Did I say it's indexed, with the little color tabbies built into the pages.....<br /><br />This folks is a MUST buy, in fact I'm buying several more copies for Xmas gifts, be nice to me and I might buy you a copy...or not... :)<br /><br />Tim Ferriss had a monumental task in topping his other books (The 4-Hour Body & The 4-Hour Workday) when writing this book, but he did, he knocked it outta the park.<br /><br />Congrats Tim!

B007IX383I|5.0|I am a newcomer to Anathema. A friend of mine recommended them to me. On a whim, I picked up Weather Systems and We're Here Because We're Here. I now feel like I owe my friend a great debt of gratitude for introducing me to Anathema. I like We're Here Because We're Here a lot, but Weather Systems absolutely blew me away!<br /><br />As an album, Weather Systems is soaring and atmospheric in sound. Yet, most of the songs seem to build and build into a great climax. The songs on the album flow together very well to give the album the feel of a complete work of art. This isn't really an album where I will be able to pick out my favorite songs and talk about them individually, this album is meant to be listened to straight through from beginning to end. Musically, Weather Systems has many layers of instrumentation, creating a real depth to the music. Both Vincent Cavanagh and Lee Douglas deliver incredibly beautiful vocal performances throughout the album.<br /><br />I read a few negative reviews on here that complained that the songs were too boring or too pop-oriented, which to me seem to be complaints that are at odds with each other. I'll concede that the songs on Weather Systems tend not to have big catchy choruses and strong hooks. If that is what you're looking for, then yes, maybe you might consider the music to be boring. Weather Systems is more about immersing yourself in the mood that music creates rather than giving you something to sing along to or nod your head to. As for the complaint about sounding too poppy, I do not get that at all. Perhaps the album is \\"poppy\\" in that it is very well produced and sounds crystal clear. However, the main component of pop music is the strong hook, which as I stated before is absent from this album. There is honestly not a single song on this album that I could see being a radio hit. Again, this album is about mood and the experience of listening, not hit singles.<br /><br />Weather Systems is an album that I can get lost in while listening to it. To me, this album is a piece of perfection. This sits in my top 3 albums of the year so far, along with Rush's Clockwork Angels and Our Lady Peace's Curve. Anyone who is a fan of bands like Porcupine Tree, Marillion, or Pink Floyd should give this album a listen.<br /><br />-KCin while listening to it. To me, this album is a piece of perfection.

B002KGEORM|5.0|Got to own the season because it was a tremendous sophomore effort. This show broke records for FX and it will entertain for years.
1476712042|5.0|I read this book in two days! It was interesting from beginning to end. Travis and Abby are best friends in college but their feelings turn into something more eventually. Abby hoped Travis would change his playboy style and fall for her, but when he does she worries too much about how they would turn out in the end so she pushes him away. They are back and forth like this through the whole book and I was asking myself \\"why wont they ever tell each other how they feel instead of going through all this trouble?\\" it kind of is a disaster how so much crazy, fun, and romantic things can happen all at once with them. Bottom line is I love this book!! Read it!
B000002U82|5.0|You have to own this because these few songs ARE the fall to sleep album of the century. CLASSIC ROCK!
B007L6VR12|5.0|The sign of a true auteur is that their style becomes their artistic strength. I'm a fan of Wes Anderson's style, certainly--he had me at \\"Rushmore\\", a movie that touched me by reminding me just how joyous it was to have the boundless but immature ambition of my youth. But as much as I love his quirks, they've never before congealed into the cohesive artistic vision that \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" presents. In the manner that Woody Allen made many great urbane comedies before his cinematic skills (and collaborators) finally caught up with his ambitions, Anderson has made quirky, fun movies that have indulged and defined his peculiar aesthetic. But \\"Moonlight Kingdom\\" puts him in rare air indeed, where his creation is not merely quirky by nature--but damned if it isn't quirkiness distilled to its very essence--no longer the color, but the actual substance of his art.<br /><br />Masters like Fellini, Altman, Hitchcock, and Scorcese produce their greatest films not by inhibiting their visions, but indulging them--the more Fellini is being Fellini, the more exciting his creation. I think making his first animated film, \\"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\\", liberated Wes Anderson's artistic muse--and now that it's been unleashed on the medium of live action, his weirdness becomes even more weird, and all the more wonderful. This film is more Wes Andersonesque than any of his previous films, relentlessly so. But the plot, the cast, the music, the sets, and the scenery are all in tune this time--in the same manner that the Gershwin music, luscious black-and-white cinematography, and iconic New York landscape contributed so mightily to Woody Allen's masterpiece.<br /><br />It seems that the more Wes Anderson is himself, the greater his movies become. I dearly hope he can continue to make movies of this artistic standard--because I'm very excited by both his vision, and his fidelity to it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The writer does a good job of portraying characters in this book.  It is a very detailed description of the events and I would recommend it to others.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This one of the most exciting books I've ever read. The movie totally failed compared to the book. I think anyone who enjoes a good murder mystery will like this book. It covers a long past dissapearance of a family member and an interesting connection to the person who solves the mystery.
0857202278|5.0|This IS great and I've only completed 2 cd's with 3 yet to listen to.  I'm really loving the presentation and I've listened to a variety of audio presentations. I copied the cd's and transfered to my cell phone to have the ability to listen w/headphones while waiting for appointments, etc.<br />The message IS not new and most of us have had 'exposure' or awakening to the Power. The message has been presented by different people throughout the ages.  This IS a very simplistic version towards the wisdom of the Power. Difficult to achieve and the mastery IS as I understand 'living your best life' by remaining in the consciousness of the present moment.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I chose this rating because this book provided meaningful scientific evidence that eased by heart and mind after the loss of a loved one.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I have read every book this author has written thus far , I am particularly fond of the way she inserts a twist in the endings of her stories .Iam hopeful that she intends writing many more
B000V4UFZK|5.0|It's an old movie, but really well done. Also excellent digital restoring and remastering, along with excellent sound. Some of the dialogue and scenes have become common Clich&eacute;s now with over use, but they were groundbreaking at the time. It was entertaining and gripping, the only thing missing was a John Williams scoring, which drives the theme and mood of all of Spielberg movies. (Goldsmith's scoring was okay.)
B003B02O14|1.0|I can't say I hate it...I am a big John Grisham fan but after reading the first chapter, I was not drawn in so I sent it back and exchanged it for another book.  Still a Grisham fan.  Maybe it just didn't suit my mood at that time.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really loved watching this bbc series on my Kindle fire. I love Amazon 'prime'. I get bored and never watch tv. But, for some reason I can watch all these terrific shows on my Kindle.  I cant wait to see more!!
B0085FS5XG|4.0|This is a little more aggressive than the last release (Formation...), but still along those lines with the modern thrash approach and the style of vocals Chuck is utilizing. I like the extra aggression and am enjoying this CD. The only throw-away song is the the ballad (Cold Embrace). I don't think Chuck can pull off ballads -- just doesn't work.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I got the first one for free and really enjoyed it...but, one day all the radio stations from my area were gone and in thier place was stations from Knoxville. Since it was a freebee I though that maybe if I purchased the Pro that I would be able to get more from my area. I was wrong again.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book in the series started slow....stayed slow....and ended even more slowly.  The writing style and form stay true to GRR Martin's previous books but just fails to move the storyline forward at a managable pace.  I found myself, many times, just plain uninterested in picking up the book to continue reading.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great ending to the best trilogy! I'm in love with the hunger games now I don't think anything can match it! The intensity and passion these books give!
B006LSZECO|4.0|is that everyone has a match. For better, or for worse. I loved the plot of this book. It took me a bit to get in the groove of it, but once it hit me, I was hooked. My favorite character was \\"Go\\". Her lines were priceless. I would text my fiance a quote of the day from the book, mostly from her. I actually listened to the book, which I bought because I didn't correctly cancel my audio membership and had free credits. I really enjoyed the narrators (one male, one female). It added, for me, another demention to the book. A bit of authenticity to the man and woman perspectives. Read it, listen to it ... either way, buy it and enjoy!
B008KE3960|4.0|just ok if u like it they will come. a lot like a lot of other games. nothing new. like atc
068987474X|5.0|Hard to read it but it's dead on. It needs to be a life lesson handbook that is required reading for all teens.
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|I had preordered this and after a month of delays, I cancelled that preorder. Once I saw the device was actually in stock, I decided to order it again.<br /><br />Now I have not tried this controller out with any game that natively supports HID android controllers. The reason this device was chosen was for its ability to map to touch controls. I knew going in this would require the Nyko app. First when downloading the app on to my Nexus 7 (JB 4.2), it clearly stated that the app is in Beta. Slightly concerning but I continued on. I figured the first thing to try would be basic mapping for a game which only uses 1 tap, anywhere on the screen for all gameplay (SkiSafari). After spending 30 minutes trying to figure out how to assign an on screen tap to any button of the controller, I did some searching online. Come to find out, this Nyko App DOES NOT yet support mapping touch controls.<br /><br />So the big selling feature of the device, differentiating it from the competition, that is clearly listed on the product description and product packaging, hasn't been done yet. Poorly played Nyko, returning device and will wait for another vendor to release a product that performs as marketed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am loving this game.  When are you going to add to it?  I have so many coins and all the boards are complteted.  Need more levels/games please!  I  am addicted.
0061726834|2.0|Ok this is probably going to get my flogged!  I am giving this book 2 stars.  (looks around for the hate)  I am so sorry I tried soooo hard to love this book.  But, in the end I found myself skimming just to finish it.  I do have book two and will be reading it soon.  But, this one is just a book that you want to take your time with and read.  It isnt something you will get through fast. It could have been cut down in pages.  NOW I want to say that the author knows how to write!  That is for sure!!!  Its just that this book was very slow and I am a lover of a story that grabs me and keeps me going until the last page.  I did read part of book 2 and it seems it is a little better.  So I guess well see.<br /><br />Purchased it myself!
B0001I562I|5.0|The Flight of the Navigator is a classic, right up there with Galaxy Quest (Tim Allen), great for all ages, a family party, of kids over-night.  I never get tired of this movie.

B005FMZWD8|5.0|It's the large display on blue background that made me buy the watch, It was even nicer when I physically got it.  I was afraid it would have been too bulky but it's just the right size for me.  It's definitely an eye catcher and I got lots of compliments on it.  Beautiful watch, especially for the price, you can't go wrong.
B0083EW97W|5.0|John Mayer has a great voice and great music very easy to listen to if you like Jack Johnson or Dave Matthews you should like John Mayer.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I've read the pros and cons about the album and have collected their material from the start and agree the production was far better with Jack Douglas behind the boards but what really is a joke on this is the Carry Underpants duet. I remember at a halftime show on the Super Bowl Aerosmith performed with Britney Spears doing some of their classic tracks, what a joke and thought they learned! Anyway, got this one as well as all the other formats of this just for the collection & was not impressed it took this long for a Aerosmith release! Also have to wonder, WHY Steven Tyler even did \\"American Idol\\". He really was too nice all the time on that show and seems he is still too nice on this one. Well, I gave it a \\"3\\" but this is not as good as \\"Done With Mirrors\\" in my opinion. Please guys, get it together & produce a album like you guys use to do.<br />Drop by my site sometime at \\"JudeMac Forever\\" for a visit.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I love The music and vocals. First time I remember hearing this was on the movie &#34;I am Number Four&#34; the song was &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34;. I purchased &#34;Adele 21&#34; and love the album.
B009B0L324|5.0|I have had the DVD for some time now and even burned my own CD's of this show to listen to, simply excellent. I am a big fan of Bon Scott and bet if he saw this he would have approved. Check out the DVD of this one as well. You might just see and hear that over this CD only set. Anyway, if your a hardcore fan or just a fan of Rock n Roll, you'll love this one. This one does NOT disappoint.<br />Drop by my website at \\"JudeMac Forever\\" & see what I have been up too sometime.

Based on previous experience with his customer service last year, when my book hasn't arrived yet (Standard International Shipping, 30days or less) I tried to ask his assistant where the F is my book despite knowing that it will take long because of the shipping method. After a day, I got the copy, Overnight Expressed. MOthereffing outstanding team and customer service you got. He got my loyalty there.<br /><br />4.

B007EDYN36|4.0|Makeup to Breakup was a very interesting book and easy to read.  Gave the legendary band a different persona bringing me of feeling of really knowing the band.
B00354YA4U|2.0|An interesting story but too wordy.  Moved slowly to begin with, then took off like a run away train at the end. This was my first Ian McEwan book and may be my last.....
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I'm not even quite sure why I purchased this book but it was a surprisingly delightful read - a refreshing look at life - and a pleasant reminder that while we cannot change the past, we can in fact walk away from it - not run - but walk - into a much brighter and forgiving future. Also if we take the time to occasionally get rid of all of our \\"stuff\\" - we may be quite surprised to find out who we've become underneath it all.
0439023513|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect given the number of negative reviews.  For me, it was a lot like Saving Private Ryan at the end, either you got it or you didn't.  This book trilogy ends the same way, 2 tyrants killed with a single arrow so Mission Accomplished, but then survivors have to pick up the pieces that are left and life somehow goes on, but never quite the same way as previously, with memories both good and bad fading.....even if nightmares are occasionally present.  I didn't get the feeling of hopelessness at the end that so many other reviews mentioned.  To me, it wasn't hopelessness that filled the ending but the knowing and sacrifice that comes with answering the call of fate so that the future is better for those who follow.  Its certainly not a fairy tale ending, but a very realistic one.  Katniss and Peeta both live on, maybe not perfectly but well enough considering the circumstances that originally placed them together......certainly better than they could have expected at the start of the games.  The line at the end \\"My children, who play in a graveyard.  How can I tell them about that world without frightening them to death\\" and \\"But one day I'll have to explain about my nightmares.  Why they came.  Why they won't ever really go away.\\" is appropriate for anyone who has seen too much of the bad side of human nature.  Also, as a vet, I appreciated the reality that Suzanne Collins gave the ending and the importance of passing on history.  Having them ride off into the sunset on white horse would have just ruined it for me.<br /><br />I starting reading these books because I liked the 'Games movie, a very original story.  That being said, I had extreme misgivings about this author because the one Twilight movie I saw was so incredibly bad, but it appears that the author is pretty good and we can blame those repeated catastrophes on Hollyweird.  Good job Suzanne Collins!  I can only hope the next two movies are half as good as your books!

B009VB9VKY|1.0|it was awful.  we watch amazon videos all of the time.  pissed i didn't get a refund of the rental.<br /><br />the movie itself was fun...but couldn't watch it all at once (because it kept cutting out, i had to stop and start several times)
0316228532|5.0|Huge JK Rowling fan, have read and reread all of the HP books.  I knew this was going to be different and loved it for being so different!<br /><br />It is adult fiction and as such has adult language and sex scenes - but they do play an important role in the story line.<br /><br />Character development was fantastic and all of the separate stories really do come together to give a single picture of Pagford.  While I did have a guess as to what would happen in the end, I was still pleased with the way it all came together.<br /><br />The reviews seemed really mixed on this one. The negative reviews seem more about the the book not meeting preconceived notions of the reader.  If you go in with an open mind, I think there can be a lot of entertainment value in this book.
B0077ZNCE2|4.0|I have to say i'm not a big fan of Twilight.  I have seen all of the Swilight Saga so far.  This one is pretty good, way better then the last.  Yet this movie was still boring to me.  I'm hoping the Twilight that was just released is full of action.
0156027321|3.0|I really enjoyed the opening chapters of the book. They are very evocative of India and a bright and vibrant world.  There are many questions posed and explored and I was thoroughly engaged.<br />The problem for me came as the plot developed and the family move from India. From that point on I became rather switched off, I'm afraid, and my energy and enthusiasm for the book declined.<br />There's a wonderful ending (10 out of 10) that made the slog worthwhile, but I did think it was a book of 2 very different halves.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys create music that is different and varied, and unlike anything you've heard before.  It is a combination of incredible talent, creative genius, and a whole lot of fun.

B008XNZMOU|1.0|Taylor Swift, to paraphrase Simon Cowell on William Hung, can't sing. She \\"talks\\" her way though in a monotone style with lyrics that sound like they should be in a high school soap opera. Red is no exception and, quite frankly, I am amazed at how long this \\"gig\\" has lasted. What I object to most--and she's not the only one--is the commercialization of country music by fluff artist who are not singing country music , but are perverting the genre. I mean, can you imagine George Jones or Merle Haggard singing with this gal? Taylor Swift needs to get the heck out of country and go with Britney and all the other bubble gum artists and, then, hopefully fade away like, to name a couple Debbie Gibson and Tiffany. Avoid this album and, for that matter Ms. Swift's \\"music\\" like the plague. When we lose Merle, George and rest, whose gonna fill their shoes?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good read. I have 2 kids and don't plan to have more...  this book may just do it!! ha!! l
B0085RQLXK|3.0|Talk about a yin and yang \\"comeback album.\\"<br /><br />On the plus side, producer Jack Douglas (Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic, Rocks, Draw the Line) is on board. And the band, when in classic Aerosmith mode (as on the opener \\"Luv XXX\\") can still deliver the goods.<br /><br />On the downside, the loathsome \\"outside songwriter\\" hacks are back: Diane Warren (\\"We All Fall Down\\"), Desmond Child (\\"Another Last Goodbye\\") and Jim Vallance (\\"Legendary Child\\"). The Warren song is syrupy slop, as is the Child song, but at least Vallance song rocks, in a Bryan Adams kind of way. You're almost waiting for Tyler to croon about how he got his first real six string at the five and dime. Why is it SO IMPOSSIBLE for these guys to go into a room somewhere and crank out a dozen or so Tyler/Perry/Whitford tracks?<br /><br />It's not the idea that every Aerosmith song needs to rock the paint off the walls. After all, we all loved \\"Dream On,\\" \\"Seasons Of Wither,\\" \\"Home Tonight,\\" and other \\"ballad\\" tracks back in their glory days, right?<br /><br />The objection I have to the outsiders is that they're hacks. That's it, songwriting hacks \\"crafting\\" lightweight pop pap that is radio airwave-friendly. That said, this album is still about 1000 times better than [[ASIN:B000059Z83 Just Push Play]], an album so truly loathsome that at any time following its release you could get seemingly endless used copies on Amazon for under a buck.<br /><br />There's been a lot of grousing about the Carrie Underwood track, but what can I say? It's much, much better than the aforementioned tracks penned by Warren and Child, and it does in fact have a nice \\"classic Aerosmith\\" sound...well, maybe until Carrie takes her first lead vocal. But it's STILL not the worst track on the album.<br /><br />It's not easy being an Aerosmith fan, especially when I count the hours I've spent driving around in my car listening to [[ASIN:B0000029AS Rocks]]. I think we'd all like the band to deliver a new album that just sends it flying out of the park like THAT one did, right? And I don't mean rubber-stamping past glories...look at how many times Neil Young has had a wobbly album or two and came roaring back with something like this year's [[ASIN:B00979CS50 Psychedelic Pill]]?<br /><br />Songs like \\"Lover Alot\\" have that old Toxic Twins swagger, but good grief, they go from that one right into the Diane Warren song.<br /><br />THREE stars. Not FOUR, not FIVE, but THREE. I'm not saying this is a BAD album, I'm just saying they can do BETTER, because they've already DONE better. When you've been GREAT, \\"good\\" just ain't good ENOUGH.<br /><br />If they can deal with the inter-band squabbling and personal dramas for another few years, and LOSE the hacks, JUST LOSE THEM, maybe they still have a five-sar album left in them. Maybe not. But in an age where the American Music Awards name Justin Bieber the \\"Performer of the Year,\\" a three star Aerosmith album is better than no Aerosmith album at all...right?

B009AZZEU2|5.0|I have now listened to this disc for almost 2 solid days and it is definitely growing on me.  King Animal is a new take on the success of a band that I still consider to be one of the greatest.  Cornell shows that he still has the vocals to do true rock music.  Kim Thayil shows that he has only grown in his talents to create an atmosphere for Cornell to deploy his vocals in.  As usual, Cameron and Shepherd round out the sound almost seamlessly to create a true animal that reigns as king.  The sound of this disc picks up almost exactly where Down on the Upside left off.  With more refined sound and a more lumbering presence, King Animal presents itself as a threat to current rock.  This disc breathes new life into a rock scene that (in my opinion) has become somewhat dull and not very innovative.  For any Soundgarden fan that likes the sound from Superunknown or Down on the Upside, this is the next step in  the evolution of one of the greatest bands in rock. I would highly suggest giving this new sound great consideration to add to the volumes of music that you enjoy.  Enjoy!<br /><br />*****Update*****<br /><br />I am still listening to this disc after about 3 months.  I have noticed a bit more of the nuances that this piece of work delivers.  Here is a brief break down of the songs and how I rate them.<br />1) Been Away Too Long ~ This song was the first single release off of the disc to see air time.  The song itself has the feel of earlier work, while not as heavy and more upbeat tempo.  I rate it 3/5.<br />2) Non-State Actor ~ This is an obvious slight to corporate America.  While the song itself takes off like a locomotive, it does change up beats several times.  This is a heavier song but unlike any previous work singularly.  It is more an amalgamation of several different bodies of work.  This song has had some air time in my listening area, so you may have already heard it.  I rate it 4.5/5.<br />3) By Crooked Steps ~ Both lyrically and musically, this is probably one of the best songs off of the disc.  This song has a mix of heavy Soundgarden riffs, echoing vocal effects, and the almost otherworldly guitar playing of Thayil.  Cornell uses his voice to seduce and scream in various parts of this song which helps to inflect the lyrics of the song.  What can I say other than it is very well put together and played very tightly.  I rate it 5/5.<br />4) A Thousand Days Before ~ This is a rare glimpse of a lighter track from Soundgarden.  I like what they have done with this song by fusing several different sounds together and pulling from different soundscapes to conjure a very likeable song.  While this is lighter, it is not decaf.  It still contains some heavy riffs that help create contrast.  I rate it 4.5/5.<br />5) Blood on the Valley Floor ~ This song has a much darker and grungy feel to it.  It is possibly the heaviest song on the disc.  Cornell's vocals are almost serpentine at points and the song lends itself back to a space and time between Badmotorfinger and Superunknown.  I give it 4/5.<br />6) Bones of Birds ~ Cornell has already said this song was written with his children in mind.  It is a more mature Soundgarden song, a bit more slow tempo, and not for everyone.  I personally like it though.  I give it 4/5.<br />7) Taree ~ This song sounds like it is from Down on the Upside.  While not upbeat, it is not sedate.  The song itself is then a more melancholy sound for the band.  Not for all, but I have caught myself going to it in particular.  I rate it 4/5.<br />8) Attrition ~ This song has a more muddied almost punk sound.  A slight side step from what Soundgarden is used to producing.  It is a nice change of pace for some fresh sound, though not my favorite song.  I rate it 3.5/5.<br />9) Black Saturday ~ This song is another lighter track where the band branches out to use differing sounds that create a lighter sound.  This is almost the antithesis of a Black Hole Sun in that while it is a lighter sound, thelyrics are anything but.  This is a play on words of a different sort.  While I am not sure if that is what they were going for, it almost feels like an Arabic third cousin (because of the sound itself).  I rate it 4.5/5.<br />10) Halfway There ~ While many have blasted this song for sounding like something off of Cornell's solo discs in the first half of the song, it is meant to be more of a retrospective track in my opinion.  I suggest you at least give it a listen and see what you think.  I rate it 4/5.<br />11) Worse Dreams ~ This song starts with a more lumbering bass riff with almost dreamlike guitar in many areas.  It crescendos to a sound more reminiscent of Down on the Upside.  It seems to me more of a mishmash of a bad dream and nightmare feeling to in by the end.  I rate it 3.5/5<br />12) Eyelid's Mouth ~ It starts with a calm cool bass riff that pops into a more powerful guitar riff to match.  Cornell's voice soars then dives several times in this song into the chorus.  While it is not my favorite song, it does play with some sounds that give it a good feel and I do find myself skipping to it at times.  I rate it 4/5.<br />13) Rowing ~ I read some who trash this song.  In my honest opinion they did not give it the chance and could not look past what the song accomplishes.  This is one of the most unique songs I have heard in a while, and I am proud that Soundgarden took this leap.  The song sounds like an old slave song that has been given a radical facelift.  It starts with a much more modern sound than what we are used to hearing from the band.  It almost sounds sad at times, then picks up and slams into you with the more traditional sound that Soundgarden grunge sound.  All the while, Cornell is pouring his heart into the song (sad, somber, frustrated, and angry at times).  I really like what they have done with this song to say the least.  I rate it 5/5.<br /><br />Over all I like the fact that the band is not locked into a sound or style.  I reallylike that this band has evolved over time and continues to do so.  As far as come backs go, this is not a bad start at all.  I only hope that their next disc is as good if not better!
B00026WUBE|5.0|... this would be a huge album. Of course you could say that about many Dylan albums not considered part of the Dylan-Canon. Pretend, while listening to the album if you can, that these songs were put together on one recording by another band -- any band. That band would soon be gracing the cover of Rolling Stone, playing main stages at the summer festivals, and you'd be bragging that you heard them first.<br /><br />I consider myself a pretty big Dylan fan, but admit I had no idea this album existed. Just one of those lost albums between the masterpieces book-ending a historic career. I heard about it this week while watching a documentary about David Geffen. He evidently convinced Dylan and The Band to tour in 1974 (?), but first to cut an album together to tour behind.<br /><br />This is the result. It's a beautiful, flawed, human piece of music. It is cold outside now, and listening to it I yearn for a campfire, the stars, good folks around me with good music playing. It's that kind of album. It ebbs and flows, winds like a river, with foot-stomps and sad country ballads, harmonicas and strings, an outdoor concert with blankets on the lawn. It is not Bob as philosopher-poet; it is Bob as music man, surrounded by music men, all among the best of their generation. It feels live, raw, which is as it should be.<br /><br />I'm adding this to my Dylan collection. Glad I found it. I'm not a \\"Bob-can-do-no-wrong\\" fanatic. I've forgone many of his albums. But this is a great find for me. I can't believe I never knew about it.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|I really don't have anything to say that other reviewers haven't already said, but I'll highlight-<br /><br />1)This album is the spiritual sequel to Black Halo. It sounds more like Kamelot than either ghost opera or Poetry for the Poison/<br /><br />2)Tommy is a perfect replacement for Khan. He is at least as good a singer and performer, and he stays true to the sound of the band while also staying true to his own unique sound.<br /><br />If you like Kamelot, its perfect, if you like metal with a fantastic singer, you'll love it, and Kamelot has retaken its position as literally the best metal band.

Very detailed descriptions of everything from embroidery on clothing to covers of \\"The Quibbler\\" (which I'd love to slice out of my library copy, but promise I won't!

B008I34YYY|4.0|This is a tough one. I don't know if I've ever seen anyone go to these lengths and spend this much money on a movie with this content.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. A Sarah Palin  (albeit with a Southern accent) type President of the United States is up for reelection. She sends a manned shuttle to the moon which is supposed to be a big p.r. boost being that one of the astronauts is black. When they get to the dark side they find that some WWII Nazis have a secret base and are ready to launch an attack on earth and conquer the entire planet. The black guy is captured, turned into a white guy via an albino drug and sent back with the new Nazi commander to spearhead the assault. Plots and mayhem ensue as the whole thing plays out.<br /><br />Yes this is a \\"B\\" movie but it has \\"A\\" sensibilities in all departments. The film makers didn't cheap out anywhere. The script is way better than it had to be. It sported some nice turns and didn't telegraph where it was going. The production design, costumes, special effects and music were all nearly as good as big studio releases. The acting, though not Academy Award grade, was much better than it would have been had this been made in the 80s. Udo Kier was on hand but I didn't recognize anyone else.<br /><br />This is riotous fun but it plumbs some deeper depths and landed some solid jabs at things that bordered on uncomfortable. There were huge pokes at North Korea, America's relations with the rest of the world, the selling of a President and much more. That one of the assault space ships is named the George W. Bush has to be making some people squirm in their seats. And the ending must be seen to be believed. Not the sweet, upbeat ending one might imagine.<br /><br />Again I have to wonder why the film makers went to such great lengths to put this together, but my hat's off to them. They did a sweet job and made this the best \\"B+\\" or \\"A-\\" movie ever. It almost reads like a vest pocket version of \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\" This needs to be seen by a wide audience. It's better than it had to be and I hope I see these folks handle a lot more projects.

B009HSUTB6|4.0|This may be THE seminal pop album of the 1980's that dares to branch out well beyond pop. The reissue is long overdue and while the remastering is not particularly revelatory (except maybe on more advanced systems audiophiles love to drop too much money on) it does bring a measure of clarity to an album that was already very well-produced and engineered.<br /><br />The live tracks are the complete concert of what was known as the P.O.V. video that cut out many tracks of the full show and had questionable audio mastering (but hey, many us of originally owned it on VHS - mine was on....gulp....BETAmax). However this audio is a complete remix and remastering and is the entire Athens show. This version of Gabriel's band, including the ever-present Tony Levin on bass and David Rhodes on guitar along with keyboardist David Sancious and the incomparable Manú Katché on drums, is a living, breathing machine. They give the &#34;So&#34; material eloquent renderings but it is the older Gabriel material that is rebuilt in this new band's image of proto-techno-world-jazz-rock. Gems like &#34;Games Without Frontiers&#34;, &#34;No Self Control&#34; and &#34;Lay Your Hands On Me&#34; overflow with energy and creative arranging that allow each musician to show off their muscle within the matrix of an insanely-talented band led by a fearless leader.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Having read and enjoyed the first two of Rowling's Harry Potter books, I was curious to find out how well she would do with The Casual Vacancy. It took me a little while to read because the adult characters were so over-the-top snobby, vicious, and petty that they quickly bored me. What I enjoyed most was reading from the point of view of the teenagers, especially Krystal Weedon and Andrew \\"Arf\\" Price, who lived in less than ideal homes.<br /><br />I felt that Rowling did a great job in portraying what it is like for kids to grow up with an abusive parent or one who has a serious drug problem. I also liked the character, Kay Bawden, a social worker who was temporarily assigned to the Weedon case. If it weren't for these characters, I probably would have archived the book. They are the reason why I give this book four stars instead of three.<br /><br />That said, I'm interested in seeing what she writes next. This was her first venture away from the megahit HP series, and it was better than I had expected.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Townshend leaves (seemingly) no sex, drug and alcohol-soaked stone unturned. While we may have heard plenty of crazy tales like this before (books on Keith Moon make Townshend's life seem Puritan by comparison) Townshend talks directly and frankly on how these excesses wove themselves into his creative life and personal life, as well as on the possible origin of self-destruction set in the abuse he suffered as a child. The angst of Townshend and his wife trying to keep a thirty-year marriage going that could have ended way earlier than it did keep an underlying tension running throughout the narrative. It is hard to listen to a rock star talk about how many times he set his own life on fire and not run out of the house, but his tales of survival and how it fuels his creativity and compassion for others effectively show the depth and range of emotion Townshend is capable of. However he does not tell the reader this for oh-woe-is-me sympathy, but to simply say &#34;this is my life, take it or leave it then bleep off&#34;.<br /><br />Throughout all the binges and sex-capades Townshend keeps it centered on the important thing - the music. His revelations on the mindset and ideas that made up masterworks like &#34;Tommy&#34;, &#34;Who's Next&#34;, &#34;Quadrophenia&#34; and quality solo work like &#34;White City&#34; and &#34;Psychoderelict&#34; could read like a college course on the creative musical mind. His affection and respect for his Who-mates, despite past tales by others of a-typical rock-band egotistical strife, is genuine, even heart-breaking. Townshend never pretends to have it all figured out, but shows his humanity through his own trail-and-error life that has left a trail of both creative beauty and personal wreckage.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|This is a pleasant recording.  I usually think of Eric Clapton's voice as serviceable, but he sounds good here, and the guitar work is certainly secure and pleasing.  But this is the blues . . . and you want something a bit more raw.  This is too polished.  It's not that it lacks energy, but the energy seems directed at the presentation rather than the substance.  I think that isn't all that uncommon with \\"tribute albums,\\" of which this is an example.  I mean, is Tony Bennett's \\"Perfectly Frank\\" all that good?  Sure, it's \\"well done,\\" but is that enough?  Some reviewers complain about Clapton's selection from Johnson's material, and I don't know enough about the Johnson corpus to evaluate that criticism, but I'm guessing that whatever he had chosen would have got this tasteful and rather restrained treatment.  Don't get me wrong -- this is very listenable, and when I say it's tasteful, I don't mean that it's inappropriately reverential.  But if you've heard Muddy Waters or Son House, or even B. B. King, what's missing is pretty clear.
B000VWSI8S|4.0|My only complaint is: why is/was there not more? Just set this going and put it on endless repeat and maybe it will seem/feel more complete. Sublime playing from both Picassos of jazz.
B0041KVXLK|4.0|The editorial description of the challenge of bringing Sgt Pepper into the 21st century shows the painstaking detail and care to one of the best albums of all time. Those who buy this will be euphoric in the results. All this time later, the smallest details come out with striking affect which were never heard before. The bonus additions of the cardboard cutouts and extras inserted into the bi-fold album jacket is a great addition. So why not five stars? As I thought, the biggest challenge to perfection was to accurately do \\"Sgt Pepper's Inner Groove\\" where a hidden track is imbedded into a groove closest to the record's label which is supposed to loop over and over. This was likely made before the days of the automatic needle return. EMI unfortunately has put the inner groove so close to the album's center that if the auto-return get activated, you'll never hear it. Not that the one revolution (Revolution #1?) is a necessity to appreciate the album, but you do miss out on the complete Sgt Pepper experience. Still, almost certainly a must buy.
B009EA3JDM|5.0|Brilliant! I couldn't put this book down. It's laugh out loud funny, but it also has meaning and makes you tear up in parts. I recommend this to anyone. Chris Colfer is a genius!
0670022950|5.0|Finally, intelligent optimists can come out of hiding, thanks to Steven Pinker's 832 pp on how, believe it or not, things are actually getting better. With an enthralling  wealth of statistics, research, sources and carefully reasoned arguments (and, no, calling those things enthralling is not an oxymoron in this context) as well as entertaining flashes of humor, Pinker demolishes both the \\"We're going to hell in a handbasket because we have no morals or discipline any more; we need more prisons and guns!\\" argument and the \\"We're going to hell in a handbasket because civilization has corrupted the innate goodness of primitive peoples; we need more freedom from social constraints!\\" argument. Actually, he demonstrates with thoughtful thoroughness that every kind of violence is at its lowest level ever in human history.<br />  I hesitated to read this book for quite a while, because I knew that in order to make his argument, he would have to describe in nauseating detail the things people used to do to each other, minorities, women, children and animals as a matter of course in history, as indeed he does (his chapter on violence in the Bible is a tour de force). But then he moves on rather endearingly to attribute the humanitarian revolution to intellectual advances that expanded human knowledge and empathy -- the printing press, the Enlightenment, the novel, the digital age.  It is refreshing to hear a modern academic, even as he lays out the problems of authoritarian regimes, valuing courtesy and self-control, what Norbert Elias calls \\"The Civilizing Process.\\"  This is a brilliant, solidly argued and hugely important book.
B009EA3JDM|5.0|By Christine Hallett<br />Format: Kindle<br /><br />I have just finished this book, I found I couldn't put it down.  This is the story of a person who refuses to give up on his dreams no matter what life throws at him.  A book that is hilarious in parts, as well as sad, I loved the characters.<br /><br />It is a great insight into a young person's life, dreams and disappointments. This was a book that showed the strength of a young man who against many odds did not give up on his dreams, even when he felt most vulnerable and in turn he learnt more about himself and about the dreams and flaws of others and in this it gave him a greater perspective on life.<br /><br />Chris can I say, don't ever stop writing, you are an incredible young man, who will go so far.  You are such an inspiration to so many for just being yourself and I feel there is nothing that will stop you achieving whatever you wish to do in your life.<br /><br />Kindest regards,<br />Chris Hallett

0812975219|4.0|Fools of Randomness, by Nassim Taleb, was a very engaging and enjoyable read. Although difficult to keep track of sometimes due to its esoteric subject matter, it is nonetheless a must read if you are, like me, taking a newfound interest in the field of finance and investments. I started reading this book not knowing what to expect, but was very pleasantly surprised by the philosophical and reflective nature of the book.<br /><br />The author has a sarcastic, sometimes scathing, style of writing, and does not take particularly kindly to people that do not display his particular brand of financial theory. He does have a very tongue-in-cheek approach throughout the book, and the book often relies on irony to make a strong point.<br /><br />The author has numerous allegorical references to Greek mythology, which is both interesting and fascinating at the same time. At one point in the book he argues that the heroes of legend had the exact same genetic makeup as modern man, since the time period that separates us from the Greek legends is ephemeral indeed when compared to the time it takes on a genetic scale for significant changes. He argues that this is the reason why the heroes in these legends often display the same qualities, as well as the same pitfalls, that modern man is wont to show. In addition to this the author also uses contemporary examples regularly, often citing (as well as blaming) the modern \\"sound-byte\\" media culture for the degeneration of sound financial practices. He also regularly references fictional examples that seem to be an amalgamation of the many people the author has met in his life as a trader, and display humorous and often ironic characteristic that serve as both literary and humor devices within the structure of the book.<br /><br />Throughout the book the main point that the author makes is that success for the most part a product of the inherent randomness that is so intrinsic to these financial systems. He repeatedly references thevarious cognitive biases that humans tend to display, including survivor bias. This essentially means that we are more likely to view a concept or method as successful and correct if we consider an incorrect sample, that is, a sample of the winners only. By not considering the numerous losers that the method may have spawned, we ignore a vital piece of information that significantly skews our perception on success and failure.<br /><br />The book often takes a very abstract and philosophical take on the subject matter. I was definitely not expecting that when I first opened the book, but it is very marked throughout the book, that the author is a philosopher at heart, and a trader only by profession.<br /><br />This book not only introduced me to a new way of thinking about risk taking, it also gave me an entirely new perspective on probability. The author mentions Monte Carlo generators, which I found extremely fascinating - being an avid appreciator of technology myself. I was fully aware of the perverse use of modern computers within the field of finance, but I thought this was limited to communication and forecasting for the most part. The fact that a computer can be used to generate otherwise impossible situations, to gain a better understanding of the actual probabilities involved in financial markets, was very surprising and interesting. In general the book redefined how I look at probability, since I realized throughout that I was prone to showing many of the logical fallacies and cognitive biases that the author tries so hard to present, and warns us against.<br /><br />The author often relies on fictional/real examples to better illustrate his points, which I found very helpful. While he takes a more serious approach when dealing with real examples, he often takes a very humorous approach when setting up his fictional entities. A particularly pertinent example of this is the stubbornly risk evasive trader, Nero, who is initially dissatisfied and jealous ofhis more high flying, risk taking (and in his opinion, undeserving) neighbor, the high yield bond trader, John. Eventually, though, Nero is vindicated in his application of well thought out, low risk investing practices when he emerges with the best financial situation after weathering a market storm that John is unable to survive.<br />Somewhat ironically the author laments that when Nero finally decides to take a risk, in the form of getting a flying license, he gets killed in a freak helicopter crash. This is the perfect example of the irony that the author uses as a literary device throughout the book.  The author also introduces human emotions throughout the book, as well as how the interact with our decisions. He purports that we are sometimes slaves of our emotions, but that that is not always a bad thing, since you can potentially leverage these exact emotions to make greater financial gains.<br /><br />In summary, I thought this book was a very interesting read, and I would recommend it as a must read for anyone that is just getting their feet wet in the field of finance. Through personal experience I am aware that this field can seem very broad and very confusing at first, and this book is definitely a useful tool is acquainting yourself not just with how financial concepts work, but also how the people involved within these markets think and act. This personal perspective provided by the book is very unique, and therefore greatly appreciated. I would recommend looking up some of the concepts discussed in the book if you are unfamiliar with them, as I was, since learning about them before reading the book will give you better insight into the points that the author is actually trying to make. In addition to that I would also recommend giving the book a second read after you finish, since I picked up on a lot of new information on my second run through the book, owing to my familiarity with the author's writing style, as well as the interconnectivity of the different parts of the book.

0307720950|5.0|My favorite Chris Anderson book will apparently always be the \\"latest\\" Chris Anderson book -- he keeps topping himself. [[ASIN:B004ASOVWQ The Long Tail]] blew me away, [[ASIN:B0043RT912 Free: How Today's Smartest Businesses Profit by Giving Something for Nothing]] sparked new ideas, and now his most recent work [[ASIN:0307720950 Makers: The New Industrial Revolution]] has me thinking about the steps that follow idea generation -- turning a concept into a physical product.<br /><br />I didn't know much about the Maker movement. I'm familiar with Etsy. I know what a 3D printer is, and that they are becoming more and more affordable. What I didn't think about was the context in which Anderson puts these technologies.  His assertion that the current state of desktop 3D printers is approximately where Apple was when it issued its first Laser Writer can't help but cause you to think forward a dozen years to imagine where the tech will be at that time.<br /><br />There is a great amount of information on the variety of uses 3D printing can be put to, and after reading this book the idea of cloning doesn't seem all that far fetched -- but I don't think the scientists will be growing clones in a lab, I think they'll be PRINTING them.<br /><br />Think that sounds crazy?<br />Read the book and see if you don't end up agreeing with me!

B009E3EXMU|5.0|Sound 99% near perfection!!!!!.<br /><br />Positive notes:<br />There were notable improvements in voice (via re-master, of course)I mean  we´ve all  heard  and seen  the bootlegged  material and  the improvements  are  OBVIOUS.<br /><br />If anyone has improved over time his skill with the instrument is JIMMY PAGE.<br /><br />John Paul Jones played the role of a \\"good shepherd\\" was always attentive to the rest of the band. He stood SIDEWAYS  left stage and he was always looking as if caring for their classmates.(or trying to soak on the energy of the moment)ha ha ha.<br /><br />Robert Plant ...... Who else will notice the passage of time?, and obviously has lost a large percentage of his voice (with technological aids, it passes)<br /><br />Jason Bohnam. He inherited his father's ability. Perhaps the only flaw is the sound of BASS DRUM (could have used a bigger one)<br /><br />Negative Note :<br />They cut the part where Jason has his singing seven seconds of glory right before MISTY MOUNTAIN he was asked to sing a little bit and he sung:<br /><br />\\"AWWWWWW HHAAAAAAA, I Can't Quit You Baby!!\\"<br /><br />A fair tribute to John Pat and little Jason with  a family anecdote by  Bobby, but missed those seconds in which<br /><br />Jason had his own vocal solo.<br /><br />MOBY DICK? No, they  did not  even  attempted  to  play  it, a fair note of respect for THE MASTER<br /><br />The CONCERT: Excellent choice of songs, do I miss any? Yeah .. missed like 80 songs!!!!!.<br /><br />STAGE: Concerts  nowadays are  a bunch of elaborate stes,  gigantic architectural figures,  mirrors,  and .. stuff!!!!<br /><br />Good  old  Rock n´Roll band needs no elaborate sets, screens,  flashes and  stuff...<br /><br /> A PALLET IS ENOUGH!!!!.<br /><br />The screen behind them, I would have preferred a smaller screen. Although the videos were very good some tributes to \\"The Song Remains The Same concert\\" as They also showed the screen split in two with the  GIBSON DOUBLE NECK GS.<br />And some more tricks that we´ve all gotta see.<br /><br />The videos accompanying each song:  Good, all good, but which takes the prize as the best?  the video of KASHMIR!!!!. Definitely the best!!!!!!!.<br /><br />songs: (very long detail all)<br />GOOD TIMES BAD TIMES:  The band was obviously  nervous at the beggining, but they  settled inmediately<br /><br />RAMBLE ON: (in my opinion the only weak song of the concert.)<br /><br />IN MY TIME OF DYING: extraordinary, perfect, 101%<br /><br />DAZED AND CONFUSED: magnificent, elegant.<br /><br />STAIRWAY  TO  HEAVEN:  The only one in which not even the technological aids saved Plant's voice.<br /><br />KASHMIR...... kashmir The best version I've seen / heard.<br /><br />Encores.<br /><br />WHOLE LOTTA LOVE:<br /> SPECTACULAR!! Just a phrase serves to describe this GREAT song \\"Shake for me girl, I wanna be your back door man\\" HAH HAH HAH!!!!<br /><br />Encore 2<br /><br />ROCK N´ ROLL:<br />HIGH LEVELS OF ENERGY ALL THE WAY Not teh best  guitar parts but It was good to see old friends of John, reveling in Jason's ability at the very end of the show . A tribute to  dad  by Jason right at the end and in my opinion the spirit of John was prowling the stage throughout the concert, but it was the very end when he came to stage to be with his  fellas , his accomplices, his BROTHERS.<br /><br />LONG LIVE ROCK N´ ROLL!!!!!! This concert is a testament of  waht  ROCK N¨ROLL  is all  about.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|I've allways loved this movie, I have it on DVD and I've seen it like 10 times, but now in 3D I must say, I just love how it looks, way better, I even notice a couple details that I never saw on the DVD. It's worth it.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This game Sucks... it is senseless,  you need a mechanic for every board...not knocking you if you enjoy this game...not for me.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I would give this book 10 Stars!  It presents a mirror for us to look back at ourselves and see the prejudices we all contain.  You feel like you are right there hearing the author tell his story, and become a part of the journey.  What a lovely book, not just for certain religious faiths, but for all of the world and faiths.  This one will not go on the shelf or in a bin; I will definately be reading it again.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I love The Good Wife. It is scandalous, funny, sad, shocking, you name it. I enjoy seeing what legal maneuvers they are going to try next.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|This is a neat game where you must build a contraption to get a pig to a certain place. However, it has one HUGE flaw. The app automatically tries to keep the pig centered on the screen, which means that the whole screen scrolls and jiggles as the contraption moves across hills and bumps. If you are the slightest bit prone to motion sickness, this app will make you want to throw up after about about 5 minutes of using it.
0525958002|5.0|Ive been anticipating the release of John Taylor's In The Pleasure Groove ever since I heard of its conception...and it did not dissappoint! Ive been a Duran Duran fan for 30+ years and boy what memories this book conjures up! John writes with an ease and clarity that made this a Pleasure to read!
0812981448|5.0|Brilliant company.  Brilliant guy.  Brilliant book.  If you are looking to start up an organization, I highly recommend this book.

B001GF7WRW|2.0|Wanted a smaller, lighter, more comfortable set of over the ear phones for home use to replace a very old pair of Radio Shack Nova 40's. Read all the reviews and eagerly ordered these, only to be disappointed. The sound quality is good, but no better than the twenty dollar Novas. The comfort of these phones is terrible. My ears did not fit entirely within the pad, so as a result, the phones pinned my ears against my head, and with a fair amount of pressure, so I could not wear them for more than a few minutes. Returned them and bought instead a pair of Koss PortaPro's which I am much happier with.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it its just that you have to get point's to get a game a lot of them need lots of points

B0063GORYU|4.0|love it, keeps me occupied for hours. wish i had found it sooner. have it on my kindle and my phone
B00395ZYVS|4.0|The book held my interest.  The characters were well developed and the story brought the Indian culture to life.  It dealt with the hopes and dreams people have in life for themselves and their families.  It explores the meaning of family and how the role of family affects one's life.  I read this for my book club and would reccommend it for an easy and worthwhile read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is masterful at his craft and this is no exception.<br />Written in the first person, you are really taken down the path toward the unknown and then Bang. Didn't see that coming.

B009RI4ZKC|5.0|i had to watch this more than once to get it. because it's different, which is rare and delightful. I recommend this movie
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Recommend it to just about anyone and it is way better than the movie. Six more words are required yes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading the third book in which the author took the time to tie up loose ends around the plot and characters....but I ask \\"How could Katniss refuse to take on the mockingjay role?\\"  She was the linchpin in the rebel revolt....and let's face it we all have a little Katniss inside of us.  I love the trilogy and highly recommend the whole series.
0061733199|5.0|I like the book a lot.  It has a lot of usefull info in it and is tucked in my car at all times in case I need it.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I'm not a big Woody Allen fan, but I quite enjoyed this one. Woody Allen's typical neurotic role is played by Owen Wilson and he's not as annoying as Allen usually is. Good to watch the movie to see how Allen weaves the several literary reference to express his theme.

B005CWRB44|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />Best micro-sized LED light on the market, based on my<br />research of more than 150 different lights across at least<br />half a dozen dominant brands. For a keychain carry it's ideal.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The twist head is probably necessary to keep the light<br />small. I much prefer a rear end clicky switch, esp. for lights<br />that have more than one lumen level.<br /><br />I wish the tolerances were a bit tighter. When the light is in<br />OFF postion there is a gap of 1/8 of an inch. Not bad. But it<br />does offer a chance for that 1/8 gap to get clogged with grit/pocket debris.<br /><br />People complain the batteries are pricey. I bought a package of 12 that<br />are brand new, expiration date is 2022, from a reputable merchant on a well<br />known auction website - you know which one. Cost per battery is about $3. To me<br />that's perfectly acceptable.<br /><br />I own several great flashlights, mostly tactical lights<br />chosen for strength, durability, compact size, super high<br />illumination capability, and no unnecessary bells and whistles.<br />While a couple of my favorite palm-length LED lights are made<br />by PELICAN, a great manufacturer, when it comes to compact<br />keychain-sized constant carry lights, I have found none that<br />compete with FENIX. The E15 140 Lumens is no exception.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read so glad that I read it! I was amazed at how the whole series came together! I recommend the series to anyone!
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|W love it. It has a great message to all kids and makes them laugh. Imporrtant messages about self confidence.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Love, love, love this CD.  The songs are fun, hot, and soulful.  I especially love, \\"Gone, Gone, Gone,\\" \\"Get Up Get Down,\\" and \\"Drive Me.\\"  \\"Home\\" of course was already spectacular.  I espeically love and respect that he wrote most of the songs himself.  Oh, and his remake of \\"wicked Game\\" is so sexy, if it's possible for that song to get any sexier! So glad Phillip is getting the success he deserves.  He is such a talented artist.  I have loved him since his first audition on AI and knew he could/should win.  Kind of off topic, but I've also met him, and he is such a nice, funny, genuine guy.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|Arrived safely without damage.  Easy to assemble.  It does have it's own amp so does not work well with a component system - sound too distorted.  Once we discovered it had its own amp and we connected it directly to the speakers the sound was very good.  We have not tried the vinyl to mp3 conversion yet so cannot attest to that function.  Would buy again.
B0094M1C5W|3.0|Remake of a great movie; Johnny Depp and Angie are both talented actors, but unfortunately the necessary chemistry between  the two just wasn't there.
141659521X|4.0|As all the Mitch Rapp character books Vince Flynn combines high intensity action as well as great sub plots.  Although I loved the book I was a little disappointed the way it ends so quickly.  In the book there are several sub plots going on and then in the last few -pages everything gets wrapped up --in my mind way to quickly.  I think there was enough substance to support a more thorough discussion of how intertwined bad guys were brought to justice.  It almost seemed like the writer decided the story should end and zap zap zap it was over.  Having said thatI will eagerly await Flynns next book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Although the amazon kindle fire has a lot of cool free apps I think they should add a minecraft pocket edition lite. Now that is something I think every one should like.
B00917IQFY|5.0|I have only heard one song on the radio....so no review but it just stuns me that these men are thought so little of that the songs from this release are not listed. The Titles of their songs ALONE are better than most of the dreck that passes for music these days...I remember those five night stands at The Ritz N.Y.C. in the 80's...You always delivered the goods in the wee hours...No more of that now but carry on laddees ...Yer as good as any ...and better than most...GP just a quick elbow in the side...what say you have a go at Struck By Lightning with the old firm? The fans will win in the end. Bless your lumbago, Dave.

B009H7SCMA|5.0|'Gabriella' by Alan Hardy combines cricket, class warfare, comedy and erotica in a literary adventure quite unlike any other.<br /><br />Gabriella, the head girl at St Swithins Public School, is adored by all. Tall, blond, curvaceous and lovely, her effect on men is a constant in life; man and boy alike can be counted upon to fall about themselves in tented-trousers worship at even the merest glimpse of her well-bred fanny.<br /><br />That is, until she meets Jim, the handsome cricketer and class combatant. Strong and proud, Jim's arrogant glares tear through Gabriella as effectively as his bowling tears through St Swithins' batting line-up. He soon has St Swithins teetering on the edge of an unprecedented grammar-school defeat. And so, it is up to Gabriella to don the pads, grab a bat, stuff a protector down into the old G-string there, and save the day...<br /><br />'Gabriella' is a ripping read, provoking mile-wide grins from start to finish. It offers a wicked insight into the chasmic separation of classes in countryside England as well as an effective education on the finest game in the world. Every upper- and lower-class parody is in attendance, from Gabriella's rich and twittish parents, to Jim's own whimsically empty-headed parents, and everyone inbetween. My favourite character was Chivers, the unerringly faithful butler with the ability to materialise on command, ever-ready with a glass of tipple and a vial of cocaine to help Gabriella come to grips with what, possibly, might may very well be... love?<br /><br />Howzat, sir??? Five stars!
0345803485|1.0|I wish I could say it as succinctly as some of the other reviewers, but I am simply stunned at how inaccurately, how poorly, this book is written, and how disgusted I am that I spent even one cent on it. I can't even force myself to finish the first book. It does not even rate ONE star, but I can't leave a review without being forced to mark at least one of them<br /><br />PLEASE Save yourself the misery of this series - and save your money for something better.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it ok there are a lot of pop up all the time!!!!!!!<br />cant stand those they make me angry pew!
1575666286|2.0|This therapy is using a diet very high in potassium- including foods rich in potassium and supplements. If you have kidney disease high levels of potassium could be dangerous. Too much potassium in a normal person is potentially fatal. This diet and the therapy is akin to treating your body like a sponge, that absorbs nutrients, supplements, and then purges it all out, over and over. If you are looking for an alternative to cancer treatment try Dr. Burzinski. I believe Netflix has a documentary about his history of treating and curing cancers. I had no idea what this book was about. I was looking for a good vegetarian diet since I have kidney disease.
B0036EH3U2|2.0|The first season was passable, but it spiralled rapidly downhill, and I have never made it past season 3.  I have no idea how this show got so popular.  The portrayal of artificial intelligence is inept at best, the constant religious references are juvenile, the technology is ridiculous (they have FTL drives, but their fuel is refined on a 19th-century conveyor belt by people who, with fifty of them standing around, can't come up with a reason NOT to stick your hand in the big heavy machine??), the characters are almost universally unlikeable, and the constant pro-union/socialism preaching is just plain irritating.  And of course, there is the fact that the show expects you to develop emotional sympathy for the Cylons, who are by definition inanimate objects.<br /><br />It isn't even really a re-make of Battlestar Galactica (although it tries to throw a bone to fans of the old series in Season 3); most of the parts of it that work are ripped off of Babylon 5 (especially watch the battles in the first couple of episodes; you will literally see B5's \\"self-defense grid\\" come online).<br /><br />I would simply have rated it one star, but if you just want some mindless sci-fi action, it does have decent special effects.  And Olmos' performance does carry the show for the first season.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Stan Lee does it very well. The 3D was very cool as well. After I saw it at the theater I could not wait to buy it once it came out on DVD.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Prometheus was an excellent movie. The entire family enjoyed the movie. It was well-written and action packed.  I highly recommend the movie.

B007HGPBRC|5.0|This is the very touching last publication from the great Christopher Hitchens. His insights reveal his sharp mind, even in his last days.<br /><br />You will be missed, Hitch!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book from John Grisham is fiction at it's best. Fabulous plotting has you gripped from the beginning to the very end. The best fictional read I have had in the last year. can't wait for his next book, hence the five Star rating from me.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Great deal here. For 20.00, I got a Blu-Ray, DVD and a bonus movie. Great movie too. I purchased it sight-unseen because I love Pixar's work but also it's just great reference (I'm a 3D artist too). The hair and water sims in this movie are mind-boggling. Great story too, of course. I totally recognized Kelly MacDonald's voice from Boardwalk Empire.
0307887448|4.0|Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is an immersive, coagulated soup of nostalgia and pop-culture reference that sticks in your pores, gets under your fingernails and dampens your hair. It's a tribute to a decade of excess and overload when everyman technology was on the cusp of finding real traction. These things are where the novel is boldly, reverentially, tediously exceptional. As a teenager in the 80's, I found great joy and remembrance in the mention of John Hughes' films, archaic (now) video games like Tempest and Defender and Space Invaders, and music from Rush and others, and the way that these elements were not only woven into the fabric of the story, but were critical to its progression. The dystopian future created in RPO is intriguing and insightful, if not exactly original, and the fact that it's biggest prize hinges on regressing by several decades is clearly where its strength lies. Wade is a nerd for the ages. His only real life is in his fake online persona residing in The Oasis, future's creative next step from World of Warcraft. The book revolves around Wade and his fellow gunters battling cyber villains in cyber space for a cyber prize that will translate to real money in the real world where neither he, nor his friends, spend any real time. It is here that the novel stumbles for me, and the reason I cannot give it highest marks. Cline's dialogue and passion are absolutely evident when he regales us with his expert knowledge of Pac-Man or obscure movie references, but these same traits are woefully unbalanced when he tries to generate the effect with action sequences and dialogue. A lot of the action happens off-line (no pun I swear) and is retold in a retrospective monologue by Wade. It works within the context of the story, but the residual taste leaves my bibliographic meter a little flat. The weakest part of the book is the direct interaction between characters. Often the exchanges are stunted and generate no real emotional connection to the reader. When I finished the book, I couldn't figure out if this was by design. I don't think it was, but if so, Cline is more brilliant that I gave him credit for. After all, in a world where people spend more time being cyber renditions of themselves, maybe direct exchanges between actual other humans would be clunky and unfulfilling. Ultimately, this book is salvaged and elevated by its exceptionally well-researched and communicated nostalgia. It was good enough to bring this well above the average.ader.

0307346617|5.0|I started off with the audio book on this, and got the printed book later on, just for the record.<br /><br />The audio book is fantastic.  A full cast, with Max Brooks as the \\"interviewer\\" and various well-respected, well-known actors playing the \\"interviewees\\" throughout.  It's as \\"real\\" as you're ever likely to get in this sort of topic.<br /><br />The written book includes large sections not present in the audio book.  I actually recommend getting both, as a result.  You'll then read the \\"missing\\" sections, with the character from the audio book \\"speaking\\" in your head.<br /><br />The one complaint I've seen from people is that the writing style doesn't clearly set apart various characters.  But...  that's because it's not supposed to, really.  Each character has their own voice, and that voice is something you'll best get from the audio book.  I never experienced this at all, and nobody I know who has listened to the audio book has said so, either.  Alan Alda doesn't sound, or speak, anything like Henry Rollins, or Mark Hamill, or Jurgen Prochnow, or any of the others, after all... and the delivery is half the \\"sell\\" here.<br /><br />The most interesting part is that this is not, really, a \\"Zombie\\" book at all.  Like the best \\"zombie\\" stories, it's really a story about PEOPLE.  The zombies merely serve as set-dressing for the drama which these various people experienced.  Some of the best vignettes in this collection of stories don't even directly involve zombies.  (Without giving away spoilers, the one involving a South African man with an identity crisis is a great example of that.)<br /><br />The stories are universally very, very human.  A female pilot, stranded after her \\"relief aircraft\\" breaks up in mid-air... or the story of a woman who was a young girl, evacuated to the \\"frozen north,\\" during the first days of the crisis.  Or Alan Alda's bit, which is all about how they restructured the economy to create a working system to help \\"win the war,\\" and on and on.  Henry Rollins' bit, playing T. Sean, the \\"mercenary,\\" also has little if anything to do with actual zombies... but is far, far more horrifying as a result, and utterly plausible, I hate to say, if ANY \\"pandemic\\" were to occur.<br /><br />This is just excellent storytelling, in a very creative style.  The \\"set dressing\\" for every story is \\"the zombie apocalypse\\" but every story is about the person, not the situation.<br /><br />A woman I know, who finds \\"horror\\" stories to be, well... \\"horrifying\\"...  actually liked this, and liked it a lot.<br /><br />A definite \\"don't miss,\\" but while you'll still enjoy it if you're a \\"zombie fan\\" type...  I can imagine zombie fans being disappointed by how little direct \\"horror\\" there is in this, while the \\"non-horror fan\\" will find a LOT to like in this book.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Have not read Grisham in a while but needed something to read and this looked interesting.<br />As I said, a bit slow at the beginning. Did not realize till I was about 1/3 through it that it was much more complicated then I thought...........then did something I have never, ever done...........went back and started from the beginning again. Great character development and without giving anything away........very clever and involved story ..........really did not remember any of his other books being this subtle and surprising..............you need to really pay attention but it's worth it.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham with good detail, and sly twists.  Who says the little guy can't win (In the end).<br />Worth the money.

B000000XBC|5.0|We loved getting this CD.  In the process of moving we lost this CD and because it was so old, did not think we could replace it, so we were delighted to find it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The only thing that spoils Grisham's latest effort is his tendency repeatedly to jab the federal government.  The villain du jour is the FBI, whose oppressive tactics have landed an (apparently) innocent man in a country club prison.  But he's found a way to get out.  He knows who offed a federal judge and his mistress at a remote cabin, and he'll reveal all--for a price.  I won't spoil it for you by telling you how it turns out--except to say that you'll find it done with several neat twists.  The underlying hypocrisy of the book is its negative portrayal of all federal officials, including the late judge, while the actions of the protagonist are made to seem heroic and somehow justified.  Flexible morality, to put it mildly.

B005IQZB14|4.0|Ms Strayeds story is a compelling presentation of a fairly unusual and non-traditional family and its apparent impact on her and her family.  Cheryl does an outstanding job of describing her quest to walk the trail and the challenges it presents and it also describes the phenonmenal inner strength of character as well as her surprizingly significant physical strength.  I found her story one of a clearly intelligent lady going through a wide range of human feelings and experiences.  Her clear honesty related to her feelings was most interesting and the way in which she dealt with them put you right by her side. If you don't share at least some of her experiences as you read her story you might miss the story behind the story. The PCH is a beautiful and challenging experience, but I have never seen it as presented by Cheryl with her dealing with her problems and challenges.  Very interesting, fun at times, painfull at times, challenging and ultimately a great story about conquering lifes roadblocks and overcoming them on the road to a better life and a better person......congrats Ms Strayed
B009AP2G26|5.0|I love the music, the characters, the writing, and the cast. They are incredibly talented young actors, and the show continues to please!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Although just a hair beneath the incredulous perfection of Season I, Season V of Mad Men is a reminder of the utter quality reaked by this series, in all senses: acting, period accuracy, costume, production and, most importantly, writing.  Instead of crumbling-- instead of any internal deterioration, which is unfortunately so common in successful TV series-- the story lines in Season V became progressively more riveting, as if it were simply a collection of scripts to be woven into the unparalleled brilliance of Season I.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This is the best combination of writing, acting, and interesting. The characters are charming in all their idiosyncrasies. Love this show! It's one of the best on TV!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Beatles fan here from when I was a kid in the 80's... I worked at a record store and saved every nickel to buy one LP per week. I loved the idea of having a 12\\" record in my hands with large artwork to boot!<br />Opening up the album, taking it out of the sleeve to see the glistening, black, vinyl.... Then checking out the label.. And eventually, putting it on the turntable.... The excitement I got from the into to Sgt Pepper can't be duplicated.  I love this box, mine came with NO issues at all. I played the discs and thought it was produced very well. I WILL go out and get the Mono set when that comes out as well.<br /><br />What I would like to see: A vinyl box set of the USA pressings.... Mono & Stereo....  But I guess we can't have everything we want, now can we?<br /><br />Apple?
B000JMKOI2|5.0|If you're looking for a novel with a linear story, A to B plot, and a fulfilling resolution, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Bukowski flourishes in his decadent and depraved journey, wandering between jobs and drinking himself into oblivion. His alter ego, Henry Chinaski, seeks to satisfy his primal urges with women and drinking, while putting as little effort into empty part-time jobs he picks up. This isn't a story of love or overcoming difficulty, and the protagonist doesn't end up in any different circumstance than the one he began in.<br /><br />His visceral writing and unforgiving description of his debauchery, ranging from getting crabs to sleeping with multiple women on a boat, is actually very vulnerable and shows that Bukowski has no fear of self-deprecation.
B001IF252M|5.0|This adapter is just like the one that you can get at the Apple store (in-person or online), and not having to pay sales tax on it is always nice! I haven't had any problems with it since I got it a few months ago.
B008PE9GSA|3.0|I was very excited to check out the latest from that little old band from Texas. The Jeremiah Weed commercials sure pimp it up enough. I've been a die hard ZZ Top fan since high school, in the 70's, and am a member of 'the Club' so this hurts a little to say; I don't like this album. It honestly sounds like some guys trying too hard to sound like ZZ Top. There are a couple, perhaps three, tracks that have something to them, but the rest of it sounds like unused filler from some other unreleased album. The lyrics are parodied lines of old Blues cliches, and the licks are largely weak and disjointed. I could say more, but I'd just be beating a dead horse. Get back to the old stuff guys, you've gotten into somebody else's Kool Aid.
B00136S0NE|5.0|I love this soundtrack (the movie is great, too)! It has a good mix of amusing, silly, and sincere songs and the vocals are awesome.  This album is perfect for anyone who likes more folksy music that you won't hear anywhere else.
0316228532|4.0|Since I'm such a fan of the Harry Potter series, I was expecting great things from this book.  However, it's not that exciting to read, and I am fully able to put it down and not pick it back up for several hours, if not days!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This is a popular apps so I wont get into detail to discuss what it does.  I like the game but have no patience to keep playing it. I play it once a while.  Price is fair though. Ir worth the money.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have never been a Cornwell fan and Bone Bed did not change my view. The agonizing flow of details presented in the text may be of interest to laymen but for me, a person familiar with the autopsy procedure, the step by step descriptions became tiresome. I expected the good Doctor to take time out to describe brushing her teeth. Also, authors should steer away from details having to do with firearms unless they have taken an NRA course. They need to know that pistols do not have &#34;clips&#34; ,they have &#34;magazines&#34;. This work reminds me of the almost good movie that was just fifteen minutes too long. Hollywood and authors seem to want to be sure that their fans (readers) always get their money's worth.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is very addicting. But there is so much to do and not enough energy to do it. I really enjoy playing and got it FREE!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|with limited energy you can only do so much unless you have money to invest. it's good the energy is limited or I will spend way too much time here cause as it is I spend enough time here. at least it tells you when energy is up. I haven't had to update so I haven't had that glitch to face yet. I am good at uninstalling so that I will do,theonly thing that gets me is the stupid &quot;cloud&quot;  on kindle fire that will remnd me of what I hate
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A lot of the games remind me of games I played as A kid. Pretty cool to see them on one app.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The cast looked good, but the seedy storyline left me not wanting more.  Sorry; I was really hoping for something better.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|The app itself is pretty neat & interesting. However after I signed on to my account the nice sleek facebook format on my tablet changed into a clunky ugly phone-styled format that wont go away even after I uninstalled the app. Has this happened to anyone else?
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is another well done animated movie - great color!  I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it may be a bit too intense (scary) in places for the little ones.
B00992CF6W|1.0|hay I hats this game it gave everyone update accept kindle fire I hats who eve gave people that update. for ipAd ipod stupid.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My granddaughter and I watched this movie together.  It is beautifully done, with an appealing cast of characters.  I absolutely loved this movie!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham tells a good mystery with a twist to the end.  The good guys don't always win, or do they?  Well written and an easy read.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|It was a trip down memory lane, but a little corny.  What a bunch of colorful characters!  Glad we've moved on, though.
098555780X|5.0|love it, always use too, did what i needed to do and doing more!!! AWESOME, dont really have nothing bad to say about this product!!!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I didn't read the book, so just watched the movie.  There may have been some things from the book that would have helped fill in the blanks.  It was certainly not boring to watch, just generally not our type of movie.
0385342063|5.0|Love Sophie Kinsella books. If you like Sophie Kinsella books you need to read this one. Easy entertaining read. Would recommend to others. Ships in a timely manner.
B00846TTDG|4.0|It is an action packed movie and will definitely keep you on edge.  You'll be cheering for the good guys.
B004QL7K8E|5.0|Really good movie much more funny than I thought it would be but loved every minute of it, it was used whe I got it but still worked like new just like they said it would be
B0089ZEEYG|5.0|Down the hatch is a fun game that involves you flying down trying to ea ad many of them as you can.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I found this book fascinating since it written from the head( or was) of the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Program within the Counterintelligence Division.  I haven't had a chance to ry all the techniques he used to get strangers to talk to him and open up about their personal life.  Well worth the read.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|My sister loves Clawdeen and this playset is her new favorite toy.  The design and build quality are pretty good, about what anybody would expect from MH dolls or accesories.
B00866H7SS|3.0|More sophisticated than 50 shades of grey. Very unchallenging and I did not like the passivity of the female lead.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I just recently started watching Castle and I am really enjoying it.  The premise sounds stupid but it is surprisingly smart and entertaining.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|While I enjoyed this book, I am not sure that I could read all of the many installments of this series.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I love it! but it gets too hard. I think that the mean things that try to eat you are also so cute! I think the whole game is so cute! THIS GAME IS WORTH IT!!!!
B008GVD6D8|3.0|More sophisticated than shades of grey, but I did not appreciate her subservient and passive relationship with her leading man.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is a very fun game-the colors and art animation are very cool.  everything moves so fast I cant watch the action at bottom of screen ...that's only because I'm not the best gamer!  This app is well worth 99cents!  I wish people wouldn't rate an app by it's poor performance on their equipment.  That. is their problem, not the apps.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I really tried to read this book, but I could not bear how awful each of the characters were and how awful they were to each other - they deserved every awful thing that happened to them. I stopped reading it. Life is too short to read awful books like this
B004XQO90O|4.0|This was a very exciting movie my family and I really enjoyed it.  Its a movie I could watch more than once.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|While the beginning of the book was a bit slow to get going - I enjoyed his more reflective sections in the later half of the book
B0086DBE62|2.0|This movie was disappointing--it was boring, tedious, not funny, not as clever as is pretended to be. The only reason I wanted to watch it was to see the costumes, which were very inventive and beautiful, but could not sustain my interest throughout.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Best bridge building app I have found!  Great graphics,  Good challenges and I really like the 3d  bridges.  Very addicting.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|This is my second build Ive made. For the money i spent for this desktop I would have purchased one for at least 700.00 for this all i can say is amd this new apu is rock solid. amd a10-5800 plays games right out of the box. I have a gigabyte f2 motherboard and a 500 watt power supply  8 gigs of kick ass ram also a 6670 gigabyte graphics card. I dont think that i will have to build another computer for a long time thank you amd
B007TMON8M|5.0|Fun variety of puzzles!  Good balance of challenging puzzles without needing to spend a lot of time to figure out the solutions.  Would like a user created puzzle option with online  sharing.
0062060562|4.0|A good read about a woman savagedly beaten and surviving with terrible amnesia.  Well written.  A real page turner.  Full of the unexpected.  The ending was perfect ....allowing the reader to surmise.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I took my kids to the see this when it was first released, and enjoyed it equally as a rental.  My husband watched it with the kids and found the humor to be appropriate for kids and enjoyable for adults.  Steve Carell was great in this movie!
B009HXG9UQ|2.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a great movie. The artistry and precision of the scenes constructed by Wes Anderson have always been fantastic. The low quality of the image in the streaming Amazon video were disappointing and distracted from the movie significantly. I won't likely make future purchases.
0547884591|5.0|It baffles me how excited I am to have this book in my hands - Just arrived home and it was sitting on my porch waiting for me from Amazon. :) Tim Ferriss' last two books changed my life:<br /><br />4 Hour Work-Week - completely renovated my mind and thought paradigms, and is the single most valuable business book I have ever read.<br /><br />4 Hour Body - completely revolutionized how I thought about the human body, I did the slow carb diet and lost a total of 20 pounds in 7 weeks, then did Occam's Protocol and gained 5-7 pounds of muscle in 6 weeks which helped me keep the fat off.<br /><br />4 Hour Chef - I want to learn how Tim learns, this man cannot go wrong in my books and I've watched videos of him cooking using the microwave, so I'm excited to see how he's progressed.
