B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World examines the atrocities of fascism across the globe with a fresh perspective. This is not the average tale of the Jewish massacre; it reaches far into the depths of every human soul requiring the reader to search for answers where there are no good solutions.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This was very easy to hook up. App for my iPad and off to the races. Biggest issue is that it really just works with YouTube and Netflix. So it does not transmit everything from your tablet or smart phone to the TV.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|This millennium in his albums (if not some side projects) Elton has been intent on re-establishing himself as a musical artist to be taken seriously, rather than a declining purveyor of plastic pop and inconsistent albums. He has made good progress; with The Diving Board he has arrived. That is not to say it will suit all Elton fans. Amid the exciting buzz of praise, there have been some dissenting voices. But my own doubts when underwhelmed by first impressions of lead single Home Again and a live version of upbeat Mexican Vacation have been well and truly laid to rest.<br /><br />Don't expect an album full of spectacular tracks, catchy pop, instant classic singles or a return to hard-driving 70s rock. Pared back to central piano-bass-drum trio, with elegant shafts of colour from cellos and horn, The Diving Board's strength comes from its cohesive mix of consistent pleasures- striking piano music, Elton in fine voice and tracks that grow, unfolding their beauty with repeated listens.<br /><br />The Diving Board is a labour of love, which gathers r&b, gospel, jazz and classical influences, with sumptuous and tender ballads, a few upbeat numbers and three brief improvised \\"Dream\\" piano interludes. It may remind at times of the early Elton John and Tumbleweed Connection albums, Blue Moves, Songs from the West Coast and even (superior) hints of Lestat, or what that musical might have been. Yet while it's familiar it's also bold and intriguing- a tremendous cumulative experience for me, rounded off by a sublime title track, that lifted me to places Elton's music hasn't taken me since Captain Fantastic.<br /><br />Yes, this is the Elton album I've waited 38 long years for. It's deep, warm, dark, rich and wonderful.<br /><br />My wife also loves the album and we hope you do too.
B00CSYRHG6|4.0|There is a clear difference between this and his previous work (Tales of the Earthsea). The story is vibrant, interesting, yet won't release the entire story until the end of the movie. The animations are clearly better than the predecessor, so are the cinematography and soundtrack are masterful. I was itching to buy this movie for the past 2 years, however waiting for it gave me the English subs and a saving in 30 bucks + free blue-ray. Don't ever complain about US DVD prices, they are expensive in Japan. The Subtitles were pretty descent, however I prefer watching it with Japanese audio. Recently, Hayao Miyazaki announced that his most recent release is his final work (The wind rises), however I'm having a good feeling knowing that his son will continue Studio Ghibli's reputation.

I can push YouTube to my Xbox over a wifi connection<br /><br />If you have a Computer that is connected to wifi you can push YouTube to this and control any YouTube with several remotes found on an Android Phone or Tablet.<br /><br />Don't waste your money and purchase this when you can ALWAYS do the same thing different ways.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Cannot believe this was a best selling novel.  Where are the morals of our country.  Too much! Don't bother! Just hype!
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was great... until the end. Or should I say the lack of. Love the twists in the story, but the ending was a major disappointment. It was incredulous, hard to believe. No likable characters. Justice has not been served. Questions not answered. The psychotic got away with murder. The whole ending was a joke. Did not appreciate the lack of effort on the author's part in trying to close up this dramatic story.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Based on reviews on various websites- this was supposed to stream anything opened in a chrome browser to TV, which is not happening at all!Apparently google has blocked this feature since late august!I am disappointed as I am again restricted to Youtube and netflix...which anyway are available directly on my smart TV! I will still keep it only because it's cheap and I am hoping goggle eventually will come up with something cool.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. I use it to relax when I'm stressed, to concentrate when have to study, or (my favorite) to fall asleep when I have a bout of insomnia. I think the binaural beats are awesome, and they really work. I love all the different sound combinations I can make, and that I can save them to my favorites list. The timer is a great feature too! There are so many things I like about this app, it is definitely in my to ten favorite apps.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I have been playing this game now for a few months straight. When it first came out there some issues and I stopped playing it. Now those things are fixed and this is a must play game. The storyline rocks and the player vs player is great.

B006PIXKVW|5.0|I liked it so much that I bought it.  Very Dickensian, this film will tug at you heart strings..  Don't forget your facial tissues, ladies.  Excellent, believable cast, while the storyline is both dated and predictable.  Well worth the time you'll spend watching it.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this app. I have a deposit I have to prepare weekly, and I pull up this app on my kindle fire. It's way better than any calculators I have at home...the big screen is perfect.

B005XN31LY|4.0|OUAT is one of my very favorite TV shows. It's a great spin on classic stories that I grew up reading and watching. I've loved this show since it's premiere and I can't wait until it's new season on my birthday the 29th. It feels like they're giving me a great birthday present!
0307271609|4.0|Jung Chang's biography of Empress Dowager Cixi (Tzu Hsi)is an ambitious project, as the author attempts to cover the entire life of the empress. It became clear from reading the book that Cixi's life and times were so complex that one single volume can't do her (or China) justice.<br /><br />This book is not an academic history, but a popular history/biography that will appeal to a wide audience. Even if you know nothing about early modern China -- and especially if you don't -- this would be a good first read. Many things happened during Cixi's lifetime: the Opium Wars, the introduction of the railroad and photography, ending foot binding, and Cixi's attempts at forming a Chinese parliament. I found the writing style to be clear.<br /><br />Chang's book answered a lot of questions for me. I am a graduate history student, but my forte is not China. However, I do know something about the Boxer Rebellion and the Opium Wars and the issues with Europeans forcing their way into China. Chang showed me these things from a different vantage point, which was refreshing and gave me some insight into what the Chinese thought about the Europeans. But Chang stopped short of moralizing and presented the history in a pretty straightforward manner.<br /><br />Cixi's life was one of intrigue and power plays, both inside and outside of the Forbidden City. In the early to mid 1800s, China was being influenced by European technology and philosophy. What Chang paints is a complex portrait of how Cixi and other Chinese potentates adopted or adapted or rejected modernization. Cixi comes across as a level-headed, yet strong-willed woman who tried to put the needs of her country first.<br /><br />I have not read very much about the empress before, so I had no particular image in mind when I read this book, but other reviewers noted that Cixi is often depicted as cruel and backward. Chung also mentions that Cixi was not a favorite of Mao or other more recent Chinese politicians, who essentially conducted a smear campaign on Cixi. Whether that was to serve a political or sexist agenda, though, I leave for others to decide. In the end though, Cixi was human, and not all of her decisions worked out well. Cixi died just a few years before World War I.<br /><br />My review copy was a proof that included photographs but no captions, and no bibliography or index. So, I can't remark on them except to say that I missed them!lly conducted a smear campaign on Cixi. Whether that was to serve a political or sexist agenda, though, I leave for others to decide.

B004YCKJSS|5.0|I love this movie Matt Dillon is so HOT in this movie! I also LOVE the plot of this Movie!!!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Its very violent and gory and the unique story arc for this version had some potential, but there is almost no character development in this one. In fact, I don't think Dredd ever takes his helmet off. The fact that the movie didn't rely on cheap CGI and silly affects for most of it actually makes this better than I think it would have been if there had been more CGI affects. The movie feels more raw, almost like it could have been made in the late 1980's rather than recently. It also had a good soundtrack that fit the style of the movie. Its not one I would listen to outside of watching the movie, but it really helped to set the tone of the film. It provided an emotional element that was not provided by the characters. If you're up late one night and can't find anything else to watch, then give this one a try.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner has quickly become one of my favorite novels, and Dashner one of my favorite novelists. The story had my engaged and anxious and excited the entire time. I felt like I was in Glade, and when I broke to sleep for a couple hours, I dreamtI was in the Glade and woke talking Glader lingo.<br />It was an amazing novel that I've gotten many of my friends to read and I'd tell many others to read.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|Bummer alert: This movie accomplishes NOTHING, right when stuff is about to happen, the movie is over. Dwarves, Hobbits and Wizards, oh my!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Suspenseful, good characters, and no violence--yay!  I loved it!  Rarely can you find a good suspenseful movie without violence and not oversexualized.  Check it out!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a cute game for ALL ages. And who doesn't like Minions!? My only complaint is that my kids spend my bananas
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|The ending could have been better. Overall, the movie was good.  It was easy to stay with it as the movie progressed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Perfectly addicting. Great storyline, well acted, and very entertaining. I highly recommended 'Downton Abby' to anyone who loves a good drama.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Easy and relaxing. Just challenging enough to keep you interested. Beautiful scenery, great graphics, fun puzzles to figure out. Wish it went on longer.
0307165485|5.0|I had this book when I was a little girl. I remember it being tattered and torn, but I loved it. It has been great rediscovering this book, and my son loves it as well. So many stories and cute pictures; it will never get old!
B00CKOQC9C|4.0|I really liked the idea of short stories that connect to tell a story. It's well written, does not bore you with fillers, and makes you think over some aspects of our current society.
B005PK553C|5.0|Crazy great story. Could have done without some of the more awkward scenes (you know the ones I'm talking about if you watched it- kitchen @ night, etc), but over all 5 stars. It's great when a show gets you so involved that you really get sad when a characters story ends.<br /><br />I do want to say I was not a fan of Season 2, Asylum, & quit watching it as it was just too depressing for me. I could not relate to the characters & there were too many sad things going on. I am looking forward to this season's Coven. The cast is amazing & the story looks a lot more similar in tone to the first.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|This is my favorite film which Barbara Streisand stars in.  Omar Sharif is delightful as the male lead, too.  Music, costumes and acting are fantastic.  Great plot, delicious film.  It's a classic musical.
B00EV6T6DQ|5.0|It's a complex coming of age story about a high school junior who discovers a love that she cannot understand, and it shows how freaking difficult it is to understand your emotions when you're teenager. So as a teenager myself I could really relate to it. Regardless of your orientation, you will find this book interesting. It makes a point about love, relationships, and society, without being preachy since its a graphic novel. Great read!
B00563M11M|3.0|I enjoyed meeting the country folk and I felt for the goblins. And time spent with commander vimes is never time wasted.  Not my favourite terry pratchett but a good read nonetheless.

B002QRWJA4|5.0|If you haven't been able to view this show live, this film is a beautiful version of it.  Directed by Joel Schumacher, it stars a lovely Emmy Rossum as Christine and Gerard Butler - an interesting choice - as the Phantom.  Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the music, and helped in the production of this. Interesting that Anne Hathaway was considered for the lead of Christine, but couldn't make the movie at the time and Hugh Jackman was considered for the Phantom role.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, but wonder if there might be more passion and tension if you saw it live.  Still worth viewing as a movie until then. 4.5 stars.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|This product is fair, it's something you'll most likely to find at the Dollartree if it was available here in the states.

PLEASE FIX &amp; I'LL 5 STAR!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I know this got some bad reviews, but it is so much better than expected. Good entertaining story line, sure its sci-fi, but I really enjoyed it.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|Well, just as I suspected, Book 2 was just as fantastic as Book 1. With Book 2, you get to explore, a little more in depth, the relationship of Clary & Luke, Clary & Jace, Alec & Mangus, and well you get the picture.<br /><br />\\"City of Ashes\\" takes Clary a little further down the proverbial rabbit hole as she learns more about her family's history of being a Shadowhunter; her ability to read, understand and even create runes; and dealing with the very mounting hatred for her father Valentine. As I don't like to give spoilers, All I can say is that if you loved/liked Book 1, Book 2 will be not disappoint you.<br /><br />The thing I love the best about this series thus far, (I'm currently on Book 3), is the intricacies of young love, good v. evil and fantasy v. reality. As you're reading, you can't help but get lost in the characters lives and emotions. When this happens, you know you're in for a long night cause you find that you can't put the book down for even one second.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that I am true fan of the series and I can't wait to see where this road ends. Well enough about Book 2, time to get back to Book 3, \\"City of Glass.\\"<br /><br />Happy Reading Everyone!!

B007H7XJD4|5.0|very epic, very well done. The role of thesseus in the movie is significant, and makes the character very enigmatic, along with all the characters following thesseus. For reasons I cant say to avoid spoiling the movie there are certain occurences in the movie involving the gods that make up for the way the movie ends, and I just think that the movie in that sense is umpredictable, and thus has much suspense. Lots of gore, I have to admit. But its all good, and I would definitely watch it again for sure.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Loved this book, actually loved all 3 books! Lookin forward to reading some more of her books and I'm not a book person!!!

0143124544|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the books I've read by Jojo Moyes.  This is a very good book - a real page-turner!  I didn't like the ending, though.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is worth 6 stars but there are only 5 above. This show has drama, comedy, and suspense all in one. I'm not very big on shows that involve court and things like that, but this show doesn't focus on that aspect very much. The cases have quite a bit of depth and  more happens within the law firm than in court. All and all a must see even if it's only one episode.
B004D2A04M|5.0|I always carry a AA flashlight, but previous holders often needed two hands to return the light to th e holster. This holster, after adjustment and a brief break in period, allows retrieval and placement of the light with one hand.<br /><br />Plus it rotates on the belt, so I can light it and aim it forward for hands free lighting operations. This does NOT work as nice as it sounds because shirt tails, my phone case and any jacket tend to block much of the light, and even contortioning the body cannot get the light aimed where needed, BUT it does come in handy in total darkness, providing just enough light to see where you are stepping.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|My son recommended, said it would not be what I expected. He was right, it is more of a discussion on many social problems and ills.  Really interesting.
0553801473|2.0|I ordered this book and the series for my son as part of his Birthday gift. He is 15 and an avid reader and wanted to give this series a try. He says it is an excellent Book but how is my son suppose to finish it if several chapters are missing. He is terribly  disappointed. I am out $15 + because I will have to replace it for him. As it takes time getting through a series he just disovered the publishing mistake now. So I can no longer return it. Really upset by this.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Overall a great storyline: exciting, unexpected twists and turns but not so much that you become confused.  The only thing I dislike about this show is that characters can't seem to keep it in their pants.  If you can get past that, it's a great show with excellent acting that is worth watching.<br /><br />P.S. The last episode is a great transition to the next season and included several unexpected twists.  Good luck guessing what happens - I didn't see it coming.
1490313370|4.0|Great observations about the new on-line business potential that savvy citizens can utilize to scale up a business.<br /><br />Perhaps too much personal reflection and social angst shared.<br /><br />Clever money back guarantee pitch.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a scavenger hunt like puzzle game. Find items to help solve the puzzles in each room. It's bit confusing at first but I was able get the hang of it in no time. Overall it is fun and simple to play but it needs a but more... like more background music, item names and descriptions. I couldn't tell what some items were at first. Other than that it's a good game. Something fun for kids too.

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Cher's new outing, long awaited, titled \\"Closer to the truth\\" has the veteran singer spreading her wings from power ballads, fervent disco and a few selected hybrid pop/rock/country songs.The songs range from straight on heart felt ballads to sexy disco romps.Somehow it all works!Cher has landed and other younger singers can learn a thing or two about entertainment.<br />Cher responds to her varied material with earnest involvement. She proves that her voice is unique and as relevant as in her early days.Her recent solo of \\"I hope you find it\\" on \\"Letterman\\" found Cher giving a performance to watch again!<br />This outing finds the Cher in terrific vocal form, expounding with energy not normally observed in a woman in her age group. Ironically the first cut \\"Woman's world\\", does not live up to several of the other cuts. It is strong, well sung but the body of the song is just less fleshed out than the refrain.<br />\\"My love\\" is one of my favorites. It has a lovely romantic intro that spills into a retro Euro-disco anthem.<br />Cher sounds tender, passionate and sonically right!Her voice sails and moves through this danceable paen to love.<br />The other dance number that captures the siren at her most expressive is, \\"Take it like a man\\". Cher displays fervent aplomb and rock authority on the refrain with\\" balls to the wall\\"!. Jake Shears of the Scissor sisters is in there somewhere, but he is pretty much buried in effect.<br />One of Cher's best qualities from her early years to now is the ability to skip musical genres and ride those changes with ease and sureness. She does this here, with the myriad of songs she has conveyed.<br />She covers a Miley Cyrus song, \\"I hope you find it\\" with a maturity and womanly wisdom, about letting go of love with love. \\"I walk alone\\" is probably the most innovative piece. Pink gave Cher the song Gaga didn't! \\"Lie to me\\" also bares Cher's way with a country-laden pop ballad. The refrain rocks with a rhythm that is catchy and rock feisty.<br />\\"Sirens\\" has  a post-apocalyptic serenity. Cher shows her ability to transform her emotional tonality to a subject that takes us into another dimension of loss pain and human fragility. I can see the devastation and silence.<br />All in all the album is a great one for the songstress and deserves some true recognition. Cher is always Cher, and her energy and contemporary persona shine through the superficial and the deep. In short the star is irreplaceable. She is a national treasure.eisty.<br />\\"Sirens\\" has  a post-apocalyptic serenity.

And like I told Mr. Rollins  he just needs to write faster !! Great book by a great storyteller. I recommend reading all his books if you like action adventure mixed with science an technology.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|Okay, so when I was considering buying this Trilogy set, I had already known for sure that I wanted to own the movies. But for DVD, I wasn't sure how good this edition would be. One of the things that bugged me a little was that most of the reviews here is for the Blu-ray version, which includes bonus content in film and artwork. As a young guy who isn't crazy about comics or comicbook movies, but who still loves Christopher Nolan's original approach to the Batman franchise, I knew I only needed the DVD edition, and that'd be good enough for me. But for the listed price? I wanted to be sure it would be WORTH it. You guys out there, reading this review...you know what I mean. You hate getting ripped off with the purchase of a DVD when you are forced to get Blu-ray to get the REAL good stuff.<br /> But have no worries. This set is good enough for you if you're like me: like the movies, want above average packaging, and a little bit of fancy artwork that sets it apart from regular DVDs. As mentioned above, this DVD edition only comes with the three movies and no special features, except for BATMAN BEGINS (which is like the regular, individual DVD edition, where this \\"special feature\\" is simply a trailer of the actual movie, lol). So yeah, don't be fooled. But the box is wonderfully done: pleasant feeling texture, a fantastic 3D holographic cover showcasing the three movie wallpapers (yes! it isn't only on the Blu-ray edition!), on the back it has the Dark Knight bat-symbol in black with a dark grey backround; when you open the flaps, your eyes are greeted by the three movies with awesome disc cover work: each disc has the Bat symbol, but with the correlating theme for that movie. It's nice, because it looks like a Trilogy, like it should.<br /> The inside of the box has nice artwork. You know, behind the plastic part that holds the discs in those kinda sets? Real nice. It is the Bat symbol like on the cover of the box, blown up in proportion. In the inside flaps, it has a wide panel view of Batman on the \\"Batpod\\", as seen in The Dark Knight. One last detail that might be of interest to some of you guys out there: each disc now has the new \\"DC Comics\\" logo; this is pretty cool, because separately, only The Dark Knight Rises dvd has this new DC logo, which makes the other two not quite matching.<br /> And one last thing: in case ya'll are wondering, on this DVD edition (I don't know about the Blu-ray edition), when you play each movie on the computer or tv, everything plays exactly like the normal DVDs. Basically, it doesn't come with a \\"special\\" version of the Main Menu or anything. But trust me, as a DVD user, I was totally satisfied.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Was excited to get this...after 4 months it stopped working customer service was horrible to deal with after weeks of emailing they finally sent me a new but I had to send mine in first for them to review it.<br /><br />Pros: you can use it while your away from the house bc it's on your iPhone (when it works)<br /><br />Cons: doesn't work half the time you have to continue to reset it for it to pick up your internet signal<br /><br />At night the picture goes in and out..flashing from the picture of the baby to a black screen<br /><br />You can set it on alert bc it would keep you up all night long, continually alerts with any humidity and climate changes (everyone ac kicks on it comes on)<br /><br />I never write bad reviews I just wish I would have known before dropping over 200 ;(

0783225725|5.0|I find myself watching this film every time it's on.  There's something about &#34;the man with no name&#34; that appeals to the Eastwood fan like none of his other characters.  Perhaps it's his air of mystery; perhaps it's the fact that he always prevails against the bad guys - so unlike what happens in real life.  At any rate, Eastwood fans will already know this, but if you've only seen his most recent work, you'll want to watch this one to see him at the height of his western career.  And for &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; fans, Billy Curtis plays an important role in this film (bit of trivia:  Billy Curtis was the only person to play Mayor McCheese for McDonald's - the character was retired after his death in 1989).
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|So, we bought this, as we have been without cable for over a year. We use Nexflix via gaming consoles, but, that is only on one TV. I bought this, as a solution to this issue. The device is dead simple to use. The controls on you phone, tablet, or laptop, are rudimentary: play, pause, rewind 10 minutes, or stop. Thats it. I have heard rumors of someone making an app more like a traditional controller, and that would be great. But, as to this device, it works quite well!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Bought this for the wife since she had it on VHS for the kids and saw it was finally making its way to DVD.
B00DJZR46G|2.0|I've listened to this several times through, but it doesn't bear repeated listening. Yes it is back to his older style but where that had pizzazz and excitement this just doesn't. I'm glad Elton enjoyed making this but I didn't enjoy listening to it.

B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I'd been wanting this game since Rovio started promoting it on the Angry Birds FB page, but the $2.99 price kept me from trying it.  Eventually my 4 year old saw the ad on Angry Birds so I was excited to use him as an excuse to buy it. He loves it and I love it. First game he sits down and problem solves without getting mad. The game is very well done and the characters are great! No glitches on my android-based Nabi. I want more levels though!
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I read this book in the early 1970s. the prose style suited me best. I enjoyed the change over time of the characters as they worked hard using new strategy after new strategy to survive and help each other. My interest in the story was heightened by new knowledge of rabbit behavior.<br /><br />Summer reading by one of my grandchildren gave me the open opportunity to read the book again. What a joy to revisit with her, locations in the the story where I traveled. I could share those experiences and explain some elements of the story that made little sense if the reader had not traveled to the British Isles.<br /><br />What a joy!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The ending was a total surprise and the characters were very well developed so that I could see all sides of the various problems.  It was one I had trouble leaving to do other things.

B006M7JCC2|1.0|I read the entire book but found myself skim reading toward the end.  If you are a Christian believing in Heaven then it would be difficult to connect with this book.  I also think criminals should pay for their crimes and I didn't find that when she spoke of fear causing their actions and to just let them be. I thought the eastern religions were very influential in her thinking.

B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|When The Hardest Working Man In Music has a new idea, everyone should pay attention. Warren Haynes has built a career on organizing jams for charity (this December will be the 25th Christmas Jam in Asheville, North Carolina) and for adding his guitar to many established bands (Phil Lesh and friends, The Dead, Dave Matthews among many others).As the leader of Gov't. Mule, Haynes has taken on a very different project: a new album of eleven original tracks, with a second disc featuring different guest vocalists with the Mule supporting them.<br /><br />The album opener, \\"World Boss\\" is typical rocking Mule, but an unexpected chord structure makes the listener take special notice. Great rhythm guitar featured here, due mainly to keyboardist Danny Louis' expanded role as multi-instrumentalist. This track, with the opening line  \\"Have you heard the news\\" reminds one of \\"Bad Man Walking\\" from \\"Deja Voodoo\\" (Hey! can I tell you a little story?\\"). Warren Haynes demands your attention.<br /><br />\\"Whisper In Your Soul\\" has the sound of early Mule (think \\"Temporary Saint\\" from the first album). Drummer Matt Abts is featured on this track, and the inventive bass of  newest member Jorgen Carlsson is equal to that of his predecessors. In fact, one of the highlights of this album is it's SPACE. This is a muscular band that never overplays; each member manages to be heard without crowding the other players.<br /><br />\\"Captured\\" is a showcase for the soulful vocals of Haynes. Being such a virtuoso on guitar, it's hard to remember that his first love starting out was singing. This sounds like a love letter to his wife. Louis' electric piano plays wonderful counterpoint to Haynes' fretwork, and Haynes wrote a cool line that threw me: \\"Never thought I'd love someone more than I love myself\\".<br /><br />\\"Scared To Live\\" is a Reggae flavored number that works. I know that the \\"Mighty<br />High\\" thing wasn't for everybody, but this Haynes/Louis song flows thanks to Louis' keyboards and the masterful drumming of Abts. \\"Stoop So Low\\" is a good old fashioned take on a problematic woman, and the tune contains some great angry lyrics (\\"Remember that time down in Mexico? I knew right then and there I should have let you go\\"). After a few similar verses, the band plays an ascending riff, then doubles the pace for a guitar and organ workout with Delaney and Bonnie inspired vocals by Alecia Chakour and Nigel Hall.<br /><br />\\"Funny Little Tragedy\\" is the best kiss-off since Dylan's \\"Idiot Wind\\". Haynes has featured Louis over the years, but here he is downright encouraging to Louis on guitar. Haynes Announces \\"Danny Louis!\\" right before Louis plays a brief but tasteful solo. A second guitar increases the scope of the newer songs.<br /><br />\\"Bring On The Music\\" is atypical for the Mule. This is a song of optimism, although it has a feeling of foreboding just before Haynes plays an extended solo, one of his best on record. I've read where Haynes' playing here is a tribute to Paul Kosoff. Perhaps, but to my ears this sounds like the Warren Haynes that played with the masterful Dickey Betts; in fact, he channels Betts right before the end of the song which ends slowly, each musician adding a small flourish at the end. It's as if they don't want the song to end.<br /><br />The second disc also starts off with \\"World Boss\\". Ben Harper was born to sing this song; add some world class harp from Charlie Musselwhite and this track would be right at home on the recent Harper/Musselwhite collaboration \\"Get Up!\\". \\"Funny Little Tragedy\\"-I never imagined Elvis Costello with the mule, but hey-it works! Just looking at Costello's recent pairings (The Roots, Allen Toussaint ) one shouldn't be surprised. Costello obviously plays well with others. He also introduces Danny Louis before the guitar solo.<br /><br />This is the track that kills! \\"Stoop So Low\\" features the great Dr. John, and you know we're in for a treat from the get-go when he starts the number with a devious little chuckle. The good Doc only gets better through the years, offering that special brand of voodoo only he do so well. You'll crack up when Doc growls softly \\"How can you stoop so mother f-----g low?\\" right before Haynes and company jam in a very jazzy fashion-very different from the Mule's version.<br /><br />Toots Hibbert (another ubiquitous musician) brings authenticity to \\"Scared To Live\\". Carlsson and Abts drive this track with more organ and electric piano from Louis. \\"Bring On The Music\\" features Ty Taylor of the great young band Vintage Trouble. Taylor's phrasing is very similar to Haynes'. Although this track is over three minutes shorter than the first disc's version, it's a highlight of the album.<br /><br />\\"Forsaken Savior\\" features Dave Matthews at the mic, and I did a double take when I first heard it. This does not sound like the Matthews we're all familiar with. Here he sounds earnest and very direct.I actually prefer the guitar solo here to the one on the first disc. \\"When The World Gets Small\\" features one of the most unique singers of all time, Steve Winwood. One of his trademarks is to deliver some passages quietly, then rise in volume when you're \\"leaning in\\" to listen. Choosing Winwood to close out the disc was a smart decision on Haynes' part.<br /><br />The concept of having guest vocalists record a companion disc on a new release is a great one . I don't believe this has been done before, at least not in the spirit of Gov't Mule's \\"Shout!\\". Think of the possibilities-Terry Hanck adding his sax and singing to a Rod Piazza project, or Selwyn Birchwood contributing to a Buddy Guy release. Hope the labels are paying attention.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is addictive. It never gets boring and has many levels unlike many other free and even games you have to pay for.

B001DHXT6G|4.0|I think most people know what they are buying when the buy this TV series.  However the only thing I did not get is why the shows where not in order on the disk.  Made it a big pain if you wanted to watch all the shows in order.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I was a bit worried when I bought two of these to use in a backpacking trip since I originally wanted to go solar. I thought I would've just been able to get a one and a half charge for my iPhone 4S so I bought two. To my surprise I was able to get two full charges and one half charge from one of these to my iPhone and vever needed the other one for use for the 3 days I was out hiking.<br /><br />This thing works great and charges the phone pretty fast as well (using the 2amp usb connection). I thought this was such a great item for the price that I've gotten some for my niece that is doing a cross country backpacking trip.<br /><br />I had seen some complaints about the sturdiness of the battery but mine seem pretty solidly built and from what I can tell only if you mishandled it really bad would you have a problem with it breaking. the connectors also were solid build.<br /><br />I highly recommend this battery pack for use since it's the best bang for your buck!<br /><br />Seb

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|looks like the one star reviews just don't like cher period----the cd contains a mix of dance tracks and ballards. two of the songs were written for cher by the one and only PINK! this cd will get you up and moving and the words are heartfelt and lets face it- chers voice is as strong as ever......check out \\"RED\\" and \\"I WALK alone\\" YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
0425220931|5.0|This book changed my entire life and approach towards music, not only did it solidify the spirituality I've experienced with music but it also showed the importance of living and experiencing music in its entirety. I recommend this book for every musician out there who is looking for organic &#34;down-to-earth&#34; guidance.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I used to love this app but now it wont let me download anything it keeps saying error cannot download marked videos
B003ZW0MS0|1.0|Buddy Guy lays down fine guitar work on this, and it'll send shivers down your spine.  But the record has the sound you'll often hear on newly produced vinyl: thin and scratchy.  Listen to some of the LPs from over 40 years ago and you'll hear the difference: deep bass, full sound and clarity without any scratchiness.  Its like the album was cut superficially (don't buy the BS about '180 gram', which you'll often see touted on the label.)  As I've said before (but have stubbornly bought more new records anyway!), I'm swearing off buying new LPs.  Buy the CD of this one.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is fantastic, i use it to wake up for school everyday, and customizability (if thats a word) is remarkable. A truly fantastic app.

B009UNGYHG|5.0|I can't say enough good things about Plantronics product quality and company quality.  These headsets are built to last and they are so easy to use with great call quality.

B00DQVSTCG|1.0|We just openend up the Blu-Ray version of Madonna's MDNA tour that I purchased on its release date after hearing about all the problems folks have been having with it and a possible recall.  I also encountered the horrible audio that everyone else is complaining about, as well as the menu not responding easily.  I'm so used to Madonna's music sounding crisp and heavy of bass, not so here.  I hope there is a remedy for those of us that already purchased this product as it is truly defective.

0308102282|5.0|I read this book back in the late 70s when it first came out.  At the time I had some difficulties applying it to my life as it was definitely an out-of-the-ordinary approach to life back then.  But I always held on to a lot of advice given in this book -- perhaps without even realizing it.  Recently, I decided to re-read it.  As I was reading, I realized that I had, in fact, applied it to my life -- very slowly along the way.  But it was also obvious to me as I was reading Dr. Dyer's &#34;words of wisdom&#34; that even society as a whole had changed in attitude and acceptance of those who may be different in ANY way - including ourselves.  To this day Dr. Dyer is giving us words to live by and I have never turned him off and I feel I am a better person because of that. The words in this book are as true today as they were then.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Buy it.  That's all I can say.  I wouldn't rate my own kids record with 5 stars but Rodriquez is fantastic
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|the Movie itself is what you 'd expect.<br /><br />The DVD had a huge crack in it when delivered, the case was not cracked.  Amazon did fine with the return but I had to run out to Target to get a replacement since it was for a gift.  Target did honor the Amazon price so that was a win.

B00E66QPCG|3.0|This book is for all the readers who want a successful trader to share a specific, quantified system, well, here you go. The book shares a day trading strategy based primarily on trading the futures market for the benefit of leverage but can also be used for stocks and ETFs. He uses bollinger bands, MACD, and ADR for a intra-day trend trading strategy. He explains that this system requires a daily trend to be profitable and shoots for a 1:1.5 risk/reward ratio so it is profitable even if 50% of the trades are losers. It becomes much more profitable with a 60% win rate, Many new traders do not understand that the key to profitable trading is simple bigger wins than losses. The author uses profit targets to close his winning trades and generally only gets one signal to trade per day on average. This would be a good book for those that have the basics of day trading down and want a specific strategy, and even if you do not use his it could give you ideas for building and creating your own.

B00DJ80VMM|5.0|This is a fantastic album...all of us DT fans have been eagerly awaiting new music from our prog metal gods.  This album hits all the notes we expect from DT - hard-edged metal sound, melodic interludes/ballads, and prog epics!  I am thrilled they included an instrumental (False Awakening Suite) and they have indicated in their making-of videos that this will be the new concert opening music that plays behind the animated sequences before they come on stage.  The lyrical content of this album is top-notch - better than ever actually.  The topics range from the enemies we create within ourselves to the big questions in life.  I am continually amazed at the creativity, musicianship, and emotion in their music.  This album is a must-have!!

B00ABXA1HI|2.0|...'cause the function seems useful, but the process seems flawed at best, vulnerable at worst. This application requires registering all my participating devices in \\"The Cloud\\". I'm not sure I want to do that if only for reasons of security. Secondly, other reviewers clearly state this app works only on a very localized LAN. For me, that's not a problem, but then why am I needing \\"The Cloud\\"?<br /><br />I'm a bit paranoid and not a big fan of \\"The Cloud\\". I can see its advantages - sharing made easy. But there's always a presumption that internet is present and my devices are working and secure. It's near common knowledge that public Wi-Fi is the most unsecured medium exploited. Yet without it, how do I access all my stuff in \\"The Cloud\\"? To me, it seems more like \\"The Blob\\".

B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Excellent pinball graphics that will, no doubt appeal to the pinball fan. The ability to change views is a nice feature. The physics and dynamics of the ball action is the best I've ever seen. The Star Wars cuts are a nice touch - something not found in real-world pinball. Given that it's a \\"Lucas\\" product, I can't help thinking this is why it's so superior. I have yet to see one of their applications that wasn't.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was excited to get this but disappointed.<br />It was easy to set up.<br />However, it doesn't work to stream the net from my Android devices. It only works with Netflix, YouTube and Play. There was an app which you could use to stream the internet or local content from Android but this was sabotaged by the latest update to the device.<br />It does work (kind-of) from the Chrome browser on PCs but I found that it didn't work very well, frequently stopped and stuttered (yes, my LAN is reliable for everything else.)<br />My impression is that this is very much a &#34;beta&#34; device. Maybe in the future it will be better but not really ready for prime time.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started this quest in the silo and could not stop reading until I finished every line.  Such an amazing trip to take.  My imagination ran wild going up and down the spiral staircase with each character.  Totally worth the investment in time to take this magnificent journey.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|I'm not sure how useful this tool really is but it works as promised and it seems stable on the Kindle (not to mention it's free). Marking on a photo or other graphic helps put a finer point on an information document. I like the immediacy of calling the photo or camera though the Kindle Fire camera doesn't make it easy to capture anything that isn't directly in front of its screen. Getting the other graphics into this app has me a bit confused but I'm sure I'll catch on. On the whole, I like it. Time will tell how much use I get out of it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was suggested at our last book club meeting and I decided to read it.  It didn't take me long to finish it as I couldn't put it down.  I don't normally like stories that go back and forth between two different characters, but this was different.  This gives psycho a whole new meaning.  Sometimes you have to wonder where an author comes up with the ideas.  Great book!
B001QJUX24|5.0|I was six years old when I saw this film with my parents during its initial release. Needless to say it left a lasting impression with me. The Searchers is one of \\"the Duke's\\" finest performances in the prime of a great acting career and is well worth a place in any DVD library. The action and realism are a bit dated compared to today's standards but was state of the art for the mid-1950's. Yet, the scenery, filming locations, and cinematography are timeless. The only real issue I have with the film is the use of anachronistic weapons depicted for the historical period. The film is supposed to take place from 1868 thru 1873. However, most of the weaponry shown in the film was from a later time period. Throughout the film the main characters use 1873 Colt Army or shorter barrel versions of the same pistol, and the Winchester lever action rifles look like the 1892 version. Perhaps I'm just being \\"picky\\", but it seems to me at best the pistols of the period would have been a 1860 Colt or 1858 Remington conversion from cap and ball to cartridge, and the Winchesters would have been the 1866 model. Yet, the historical inaccuracy does not diminish the fact that this film is one of the great definitive westerns.  I also highly recommend the book by Alan LeMay which has a much better ending than the film (no spoiler intended), however the film is a very good adaptation. Watch the film and then read the book and you will not be disappointed.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|You could put Seasons of Your Day on shuffle with other Mazzy Star albums and have no idea there is a 17 year gap between them.  Amazing how they were able to bring it all back.  Hope's voice has not changed a bit - the most mesmerizing, mystical and enchanting of them all.  Roback's guitar work is as passionate as ever.  I have always considered their music to be \\"dreamy acid folk\\" as it always seems to uplift the soul in a raw acoustic form - no matter how slow or rhythmic it moves.  Highlights include: California (amazing amazing song you need to listen closely to), Lay Myself Down, and Sparrow.  Cannot wait to see them live at the Fillmore in November!  Check their site for tour dates across the country - limited dates and in small venues but that is exactly what makes them so great.  It's all about the music.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I've now learned how to download with this.  That part is quite easy, so the app is great for that.<br /><br />The only thing I haven't yet figured out is how to get the videos downloaded into the phone from the the Downloader.

B00F5F5WU8|2.0|I am reading the reviews here and wondering if I am listening to the same album. First off Drake's voice from an R&B perspective is horrible. Secondly the production on this album is suspect at best. It seems life a force edginess that doesn't really mesh well from an album perspective. Lyrically I will give it a 3 out of 5 as its the same bars, punch lines and \\"everybody hating on me\\" theme. So again maybe I am not up to date, but album of the year is probably a bad joke at best or a rapid decline of the hip hop standard. This isn't much better than Wayne's last album. J-Cole's album and even Jigga's were light years ahead of this album. I would even take Wale's joint. Sorry no soup for Drake on this. Same album as the last one in my opinion.

B0055QYKQO|5.0|Wonderfully made .. black .. deep and plenty of metal where needed ..  Heat sinks are wonderful ..  This needs to be put in a PC with a glass panel so you can see how nice it is. Give it a blue or red glow with a cold cathode and you are set.<br /><br />Great driver support for Win 8 or 7.
1451695195|1.0|There is a scientific and physiological explanation for near-death experiences.  It relates to the production of DMT, or Dimethyltryptamine.<br /><br />DMT is naturally produced in the human body by the pineal gland.<br />In laboratory settings, administering DMT to volunteers consistently resulted in \\"tunnels of light\\", conversations with other beings, and other major characteristics of the near-death experience.  It is theorized that under extreme stress, such as realizing you might be about to die, the pineal gland kicks out an extra high does of DMT, which results in the near-death experience.<br /><br />In summary, near-death experience comes from an organic molecule produced by your brain, and not from any sort of religion, God, or afterlife.<br /><br />For an excellent book on this topic, read: DMT: The Spirit Molecule, by Rick Strassman.<br /><br />(DMT is the principal component in the consumption of ayahuasca, an indigenous hallucinogenic plant of South America.  The ayahuasca is brewed together with a leaf that contains DMT, and the resulting concoction is consumed ritually.)<br /><br />This book posits this intriguing idea, as written by an Amazon reviewer:<br />\\"Near death experiences have often been used to support religious teachings. Perhaps the reverse should be considered. Religion was invented to explain the strange phenomena experienced due to an excess release of DMT in the body.\\"
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Lady Antebellum is a great group and this was the first album I purchased and it made me love the group.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|When A Dramatic Turn of Events was released, I and many other people were pleasantly surprised at the well-executed trip back to their roots. Not knowing what to expect of this album, I was slightly skeptical after hearing the two singles, \\"The Enemy Inside\\" (Heavy, technical and fast paced) and \\"Along for the Ride\\" (Slow proggy ballad). But that skepticism quickly changed to joy the moment I popped the CD in my stereo and pressed play.<br /><br />The album opens with a short instrumental score that emits shades of Six Degrees. Brilliantly composed and a great way to start off such an epic album. (4/5)<br /><br />It then moves on to \\"The Enemy Inside\\" which is a song that most people would probably expect out of Dream Theater. It is clearly influenced by their own more modern style of progressive metal. (4/5)<br /><br />After \\"The Enemy Inside\\" comes \\"The Looking Glass\\". At first listen of that Rush-influenced, Images and Words style intro, I could not wipe the smile off my face.  This is also the first song where Myung's bass is very prevalent and noticeable. That is a quality that has been lacking in recent years for Dream Theater. (5/5)<br /><br />\\"Enigma Machine\\" is Dream Theater's first stand alone instrumental to appear on an LP in 10 years (Train of Thought). In between that span of time, they released a single titled \\"Raw Dog\\" for God of War 3. \\"Enigma Machine\\" starts off with a mellow intro but gives you the hint that something big is coming, and sure enough you get blasted with some Petrucci punches seconds later. This is not their best instrumental by any means but it fits the album well. What I enjoyed the most are the flashes of Erotomania. (5/5)<br /><br />The intro of \\"The Bigger Picture\\" makes it seem as if it is going to be a carbon copy of \\"Outcry\\" from A Dramatic Turn of Events, but that soon disappears as James LaBrie starts singing along with a beautiful Rudess piano piece. Afterwards one of the most catchy choruses of the album ensues. Althoughthis is one of the more generic songs on the album, it surprises first listeners with quite the epic outro. (4/5)<br /><br />Behind the Veil is one of my personal favorites on the album. The intro sounds like something out of an epic video game or movie followed by one of the heaviest and richest Petrucci licks of Dream Theater history. LaBrie also outdoes himself in this particular piece, mixing vocal styles from many eras of the band. (5/5)<br /><br />\\"Surrender to Reason\\" is  the second song on the album that immediately gives you a Rush/Images and Word vibe. Throughout the song, there are prog licks galore accompanied by another brilliant LaBrie performance. My personal favorite part of the song is the absolutely monstrous and blistering instrumental section about 4 minutes in. A slick Myung bassline and a brilliant solo by Petrucci. I just wish it lasted longer. (5/5)<br /><br />\\"Along for the Ride\\" was the second single they released after \\"The Enemy Inside\\". It is a simple (by Dream Theater standards) prog ballad with flashes of good, but for the most part it is fairly generic. The lyrics are quite moving to anyone trying to relate though. (4/5)<br /><br />Finally, the song we have all been waiting for since it was announced. The next Dream Theater epic. \\"Illumination Theory\\" starts with an epic orchestral/rock theme that recurs later in the song through a full blown orchestral score. Soon followed by probably my new favorite Petrucci riff of all time. I just could not refrain from head banging at first listen. After the introduction to the themes (Paradoxe de la Lumiere Noire) of the song comes the first vocal section of the song (Live, Die, Kill). Afterwards comes the brilliant orchestral score  with REAL strings nonetheless. It is quite a moving piece. Soon afterwards comes my favorite part of the song and the album. When the orchestral score subsides, the listener gets surprised by some drum n' bass followed by some EXPLOSIVE James LaBrie vocals. He hitssome notes I had no idea he was even capable of hitting anymore at this point in this career. Next comes the first full blown instrumental section of the song with flashes of ELP. Also one of the intro theme riffs is refrained at this point underneath Petrucci and Rudess solos. After the outro the song seems as if it may have ended prematurely to some listeners, but there is about 30 seconds of silence until we get the closure we need. An absolutely enlightening and beautiful piano and guitar score that fades out to end off the album. (6/5)<br /><br />Overall I personally thing this is Dream Theaters best work BY FAR since Scenes from a Memory. It has bits of inspiration from every Dream Theater era and even from some other bands. It is easily more innovative and original than anything they have done since Octavarium. I do not take sides in the Portnoy vs Mangini flame war, but this album absolutely proves that Dream Theater can move on just fine without Portnoy. The only \\"bad\\" thing about this album to me is the production and mix of Mangini's kit. His snare sounds horrendous at times. I guess that is one thing Portnoy probably does better than Mangini. Overall I easily score this album a 5 out of 5. Absolutely brilliant, and if you have not bought it or listened to it yet, I highly recommend it.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I love Lady Antebellum.  They are one of my favorite groups and this album is very easy to listen to.
B00EDPFJA4|3.0|Okay, so I used to be a big fan of Drake, but now I think he's just okay. There are much better rappers out there. However i'm just gonna review the album and not compare Drake to other artists. I heard several people say it was gonna sound a lot different, but honestly I think it sounds way too much like Take Care. There are the soulful R&B songs that I (And a lot of women) enjoy. Then there are the \\"rap\\" songs that I have to admit are terrible. If it wasn't for his R&B side which shows up often, I would probably hate Drake.<br /><br />Lyrics)- His R&B side isn't particularly romantic, he sure sounds dreamy but his lyrics are cheesy. \\"When we f***, I just wanna f***\\" or \\"I just want some he*d in a comfortable bed\\" is just a few of many examples. The very first song has a huge overuse of the word \\"N***a\\" which is also found throughout the album. He also says \\"P***y\\" too much. And somehow, girls love this crap. He is capable of being meaningful, I happen to like the song \\"Connect\\". Now don't even get me started with the lyrical content with his rapping. It's just garbage, maybe slightly better than Lil Wayne but that's about it. His monotone is droney and boring. His lyrics are crap with frequent use of the words I mention before, and his flows suck.<br /><br />Instrumentals) - I've always been a fan of Drake's beats. This album is a little boring instrumentally however. Take Care had some good beats, and backgrounds. The beat in the single \\"Take Care\\" was great. But in Nothing Was The Same, his beats really lack. The drums are pretty tense, but the backgrounds are too light. Pound Cake may have the best instrumentals and I love that Jay-Z verse. However the rest of the album is not his best lyrically or instrumentally.<br /><br />Personal Opinion) - I think it's okay, I sure sound like I'm ripping it but I did enjoy a handful of songs. I liked \\"From Time\\", \\"Connect\\", \\"Hold On We're Going Home\\" \\"Too Much\\", and \\"Pound Cake\\". I hated \\"Started From the Bottom\\" and \\"Worst Behavior\\". All the other songs we're above average but weren't all that great.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Decent R&B in some songs<br />Decent Beats<br /><br />Cons:<br />Way too much like Take Care<br />Weak instrumentals besides the beats<br />Lyrics<br />Flows<br /><br />Rate 1/10: 7.2
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|It is fun to play and not complicated.  I like that it has a choice of levels.  A nice way to keep in touch with friends.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The language barrier in some sections take some getting used to but a beautiful story evolves that captures the imagination.
B0097AQEOK|4.0|This is a very nice set of Joni Mitchell albums that trace her development as a musician from her early days as a folk music through her period as a rock artist and finally ending up in her jazz phase.  Those who insist on only one genre of music will not like this set as it does include several genres of music.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellant as is the packaging.  However, as others have stated, the miniaturized LP covers are a difficult read.<br /><br />The only album in this set that I question is \\"Mingus.\\"  It contains only six musical tracks with the remainder being filled with very noisy recordings of the artists talking with each other.  The atmosphere is that of a noisy cocktail party.  It simply not what I want to hear as I am playing my music.  For normal play, I deleted those talk fest tracks.<br /><br />Even with the problems with the Minggus album, this set is well worth the $37 I paid for it and Joni is certainly worth a listen.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I rented this expecting a typical zombie movie with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. Very action oriented. Good story line. I would watch it again.
0143122916|5.0|this book combines the right amount of history of north korea with his personal journey to freedom. if you like reading books about experiences that are unusual or extraordinary, this is a great read for you.
B000I9VZJ8|4.0|Appreciate this film more after watching it with my 7yr old son. He loved it! His laugh made me enjoy it!
B000BKHL1K|4.0|Looks really nice in the kitchen with my stainless steel appliances. I might have gone overboard but I actually went out to buy wine bottles that matched the color scheme of my kitchen. But it looks great!!!<br /><br />It's very sturdy and I lucked out with studs in the location exactly where I wanted to display the wall mount. Not sure if it was necessary. I think on a dry wall you just need screws along with plastic anchors and you might be ok.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|Dope case.  Everyone loves it when I take it out.  They wonder what phone I have and often mistake it for the Galaxy S4 or something... Very official case.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I tried this game expecting it to fail like all the others but was pleasantly surprised. Good game other then three potions for life.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Took my Kindle Fire from nearly full (both apps and documents) to 3/4 and 1/2. Turns out  the apps were using the internal doc storage. Did a great job and took about 5 minutes.
B001CDWFPC|3.0|You cannot get directly to the table of contents. You have to go to the beginning and then scroll through the introductory material to get to the table of contents.
B006S086AM|3.0|this is a funny movie.  it's dumb, because it's supposed to be.  it's surprisingly forgettable considering the caliber of actors in it, but worth checking out.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|An amazing cd!!! Got this for my sister and she can't get enough if it, great deal if you like the doors.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very easy read and such a great story. If you are a dog lover, you will love this book. Very happy with purchase
1598561634|4.0|It really a good book but smaller than I would like. I am getting older and eyes are not as good. I wanted a larger text, but like the content and footnote references, so I am keeping it.
B004ZH66XO|1.0|Was fun at first but crashed on Samsung galaxy S4. if that can not run it what can. Should be able to fix it. The only thing that I will add is I didn't have the same ask to buy stuff problem.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|loved it.. ya gotta be a fan to enjoy it now i finally watched the whole thing start to finish!
B00000JNO1|5.0|Not a bad song on the entire album! Great music for road travel. So if your travelling, this cd is a must!

B00005RIKI|5.0|Everyone in the universe needs to own this southern rock &#34;masterpiece&#34;!  Granted we have all heard these songs a &#34;zillion times&#34;, but the fact that all these top tunes are on one album is just amazing!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|i have not read this version yet but i love the story.  i would not have chosen it if i had to pay.  sometimes i find the classics hard to follow.
B00DXP7L88|3.0|The show should  have ended three seasons ago. It's so hard to believe that this was once my favorite show. This season was much better than the last season, and I'm pleased with the ending-karma eventually catches up with you.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Just recently got into this show.  Awesome! This is an excellent season, great episodes and some serious cliff hangers!!!! Cant wait for the new season.

0345525558|5.0|Great read!!!  A wonderful gift for anyone who loves gardens and flowers.<br />One of the best books I've read in a while.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|this movie is the best so much love and hate and betrayal its crazy how things end up , i just love it
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|Modern Sci-Fi tends to be action mixed with aliens.  Traditional Sci-Fi and Sci-Fi books in general do a much better job of making the story more about the human element.<br /><br />After Earth is more in this spirit.  Its less about aliens and awesome technology and more about human character and spirit.  I feel that this movie is more like Oblivion and Moon... Its not so flashy and a bit understated but rather more about characterization and transformation.<br /><br />In After Earth the protagonist grows and we as the audience grow with him.  I think this is one of the best Sci-Fi films of the year.  I wish it got more love.  I feel that Will Smith played an understated more reserved character that can be off putting for some people but in actuality makes for a better story...<br /><br />In any event, if you are a fan of Sci-Fi and Sci-Fi books then you will really like this movie.
B009AMANBA|5.0|DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN'S GREAT WORK, BUT IS ENTERTAINING NONE THE LESS. SHOULD HAVE SWEPT THE OSCARS.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|Usually I can follow stories such as this one quite well.  Persuasion has characters who are related to each other and it is hard to keep track of who is who.  If this were made into a movie, I'd probably be able to follow it better.  I had a hard time reading this.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|ALICE KEARNS GOODWIN AT HER VERY BEST. SHE MAKES YOU FEEL LINCOLN'S PAIN, INSECURITY, AND GREATNESS. SHE IS TRULY A GREAT AUTHOR AND LADY.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Great history of rock music; a little more technical than I could keep up with but really enjoyed all the backstories.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This Movie Rocks From Beginning To The End. I Can't Wait For The Next Movie!!! Live Long And Prosper STAR TREK!!!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|What a great movie - spiritual without hitting you over the head with it.  And nice twist at the end that I did not expect. Truly enjoyed this movie, very well done.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This is a very goods movie.  I have not seen the newer version, but I really thought that this version was very cool.  I recommend it.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|Although not the worst movie ever, it does not live up to the hype. Many back stories were left untold. I have not read the book and still feel it is lacking in content.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I would recommend this book. It kept my interest and had a surprising ending. Not predictable which is a plus.
0307405095|5.0|Beautiful book, it came just as it was described. This is my first Martha Stewart book and it made me want more.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|A quick read, first half much better than second half. Drug dealers good guys, FBI bad guys, I expect more from Grisham
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I have this paper book but just listed to it on my Kindle audio option. It was truly an emotional experience! &#34;Sledghammer&#34; tells this story  like no other. It is a masterpiece. Reading it would be fine but listening to it was beyond anything I expected!<br /><br />I wanted to recommend the audio book to all my friends but for some reason it is no longer available on Amazon or from their audio book subsidiary.<br /><br />I served with the USMC on Okinawa after WWII and was stationed at Bishagawa, and had also been to virtually all the other locations Sledge talks of, which made it especially meaningful to me. I had also later spent several years in the 5th Marines. As far as I am concerned this is the definitive Pacific WWII story and I am sure the reason it was the principal input to the HBO special The Pacific!
B00A0ABQLM|3.0|i am very happy with this product it has made traveling with a tablet much easier. it does kinda slow down the internet but it is still usable
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Although I was looking forward to the last book of the series, it just wasn't as good , It was well written I just did not care for the story line, it was vague and fell flat, no  real emotion.
B00C2IGQBA|5.0|I remember owning the VHS version as a kid and in the back of it from some reviewer said \\"Movie of the decade\\". I also have the DVD 2 disc 20th anniversary version and I decided to pick this movie here on amazon when it was on sale $11.99<br /><br />I will never forget those awesome memories watching this masterpiece many times with popcorn and kitkat bars on other nights at home. I don't even read comic books after all these years.<br /><br />As many have claimed here, the steelbook does not fully close and does not contain an intro booklet. Minor flaw. I still like the design of the steelbook and felt it was negligible to deduct a star in this small flaw. Hence the 4.5 star rating.<br /><br />The film transfer is above average. Solid work, better than many film transfers that were recently released like Total Recall:Mind bending edition (1990)where it shows tons of grain to the picture. To my eyes here this 1989 bluray transfer is great picture quality watching on my 2013 Panasonic plasma screen.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book broke my heart. It was cheesy at times, but that shouldn't discount it's truth. I hate it when others ruin stories for me, so I'm obviously not going to say anything specific. Only that, I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|The cable didn't work on my bose when I tried to hook it up to my cell but that's my fault, I prpbably oredered the wrong one.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am so addicted to this game.  I have to force myself to putting down in which always  my kindle 's battery.  I am definitely trying to do the goals but trying to beat my friends is a plus.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I liked everything about this book , one of the best works from Stephen King I've ever read. He really captured the feel of being in the mid-20th century really well.
B007WPM7SO|5.0|Great wartime movie cinephotography was beautiful.  Wonderful love story, captured the era perfectly. Eddie Redmayne at his best, up and coming actor.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|One of the best games I came across so far, it is very addictive and the graphics is excellent. Try it you will love it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The game has a nice smooth storyline... though I haven't finished yet... I am so intrigued with how things will unravel... a game that's hard to put down... if you're looking for an action packed game that gives you a bit of rpg... then look no further... this is the game for you... enjoy
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book kept your interest the entire time.It was a little hard to follow in the beginning when it kept jumping from people to people.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was one of the best books I had ever read, the intelligence level of these children was amazing. Thank you Orson Scott Card. This book I will cherish forever.

B0084670FU|4.0|Great movie. It reminds me the movie Crash in the way that it ties all the characters in throughout the duration.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have done 5 of the experiments and have really enjoyed everyone of them, it was so surprising how they all proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that you really can manifest what you want and improve your life. I have recommended it to all my friends.

B008CP93S0|4.0|Not a huge Aniston fan, but she's funny enough in this flick. Paul Rudd, of course, is the one to watch...he's awesome. Quirky little movie but it has enough meat to keep you interested and laughing throughout!
B009D3CTVS|5.0|In computer technology, cheaper is often better.  When it comes to USB-MIDI adapters, my unpleasant experiences have taught me that this is NOT the case.  Cheap cables invariably cause problems ranging from not working at all, to high latency, to mysterious dropping of information (particularly SysEx messages, which the cheap cables always seem to drop even if they otherwise work).<br /><br />This adapter costs more, but it actually works correctly.  You won't spend hours trying to pin down mysterious behavior only to determine that, once again, it's a dodgy cable.  You'll just have a proper MIDI connection to your equipment.<br /><br />In terms of compatibility, I am using this on Mac OS X 10.8.5 with no problem--the Roland driver installed properly and works fine.  This model also works with an iPad, but you'll need an extra connector.  For the older dock connector iPads, it's the Apple Camera Connection kit; I'm not sure what the analogous device is for the newer Lightning connector models.  Roland does suggest using the cable with a powered USB hub instead of directly connected to the iPad.  I've not experimented with this enough to know if it's a big issue or just a concern with battery usage (as the iPad would power the Roland adapter in a direct connection).
B008D36INE|2.0|Slow-moving and depressing...Hiddleston and Weitz are great actors, but there's not a whole lot here to let them shine. I'd recommend something else.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|Zoolander is one of those special films that's pure comedic entertainment.  If you're looking for a strong plot line, look elsewhere.  Be prepared to laugh, though, and each time you watch it you'll laugh at something you didn't notice before. It truly gets funnier with multiple viewings....<br /><br />Kick back and simply enjoy!
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|Well-written film for adults and teens about growing up and dealing with the real world...and falling flat. Wonderful character interaction and fun.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I really liked the idea behind this and really enjoyed the first of the series.  She is a bit brief and the writing is a bit bland, but the story is pretty inspiring... if you like your typical love triangle inspiring.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is amazing. Every minute keeps you on the edge of your seat in a truly topical cat & mouse game/unlikely love story.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|While there is no DVD menu option to play the Grateful Days documentary, the files are indeed on the retail DVD.<br /><br />Use a PC to explore and you will find them. They are playable.<br /><br />Grateful indeed.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Ever wonder what a man who has to sleep in an iron lung does all day? What he experiences? What he goes through to live some semblance of a normal life? This is it...and somehow, it's more fun than you could imagine. Helen Hunt, John Hawkes and William H Macy all give really great performances in this film.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love this game! Addictive and I love how I can see my friends' progress  so I know what score to beat!! Costumes are pretty pricey and I agree  that I wish it was easier to earn coins. Other than that, it's still fun to play.
B0086213XW|4.0|Very accurate portrayal of what can happen in a &#34;good&#34; marriage when one person starts hitting some mental roadblocks. Michelle Williams takes us on a very human ride down married love & lust...Seth plays her husband along for the ride. It's incredibly powerful, but if you think this is going to be a really funny comedy because Rogen is in it...well, it's not. Still great, though.
B005HSL626|5.0|Honestly, there isn't much more I can say about this game, my children and I both love it. I highly recommend that it becomes a part of your library.
B0088TG252|5.0|Lots of action and intrigue in this...I like how Denzel is teaming up with some other names to share a decent 2-man story. Reynolds impresses and holds his own. Lots of twists to keep you interested.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The writing, action, story is just awesome!! Plus it's hands down the best movie with THE HULK! Finally it actually looked like he was actually in the scene. Must get how is there ever going to be something better than Blue Ray?
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Downloaded it on a whim -- never read anything by her before......but she's now a new favorite.  I could not put this book down -- read it in 3 days.....and the ending was amazing.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Worked perfectly with &#34;The Last of Us&#34;. Only at one stage did it not work with one joystick function. Easy to set up. Perfect for the PC gamer that is not used to the play station controller.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|First of all, I enjoyed _The Hunger Games_ quite a bit and for a long time was on the lookout for books with dystopian themes to satisfy my lust for futuristic settings and terrifying alternate realities. And I'd been through a lot of duds before I picked up The Maze Runner.<br /><br />Which, while I believe it would qualify as a dystopian novel, didn't satisfy that lust in the way that I had hoped, mainly because this book couldn't be much more different from the aforementioned series except in as much as the main characters are teenagers.<br /><br />I absolutely loved _The Maze Runner_, which I found to be a memorable novel that so far has haunted me and, I'll admit, given me nightmares. And I'm a thirty-four year old woman!<br /><br />This book has received five stars from me because Amazon makes star ratings personal. Five stars means that I loved this book. And because I did, I've rated it five stars.<br /><br />But there are some problems with the novel that I feel need to be addressed for those who are looking for something to read. It's only fair to tell you I loved _The Maze Runner_, was thrilled by _The Scorch Trials_ and detested _The Death Cure_.<br /><br />To start with, the language is very jarring. You'll get used to it as you progress through the trilogy but there were moments I didn't feel that it was worth it to keep trying. By the time the series was over I found myself using phrases like \\"shuck it\\" in my own everyday language. You get used to it, but it's not comfortable in the beginning, and may keep the reader off-pace with the book even as the series progresses. Whatever reason Dashner felt this was a good idea, he needs to rethink his position on trying to be Shakespearean: He isn't, by any stretch of the imagination. We should leave the invention of new words to The Bard.<br /><br />None of the characters were particularly well-developed, and I found it odd how easy it was to dislike Teresa, and in retrospect, Alby.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This story was different from what you see on the bookstore shelf currently. It provided insight into a world most of us never truly understand. The story is beautiful.
0385738757|3.0|After finishing [[ASIN:0385737955 The Maze Runner ]] I was ready to dive into _The Scorch Trials_ with both feet, eager to find out what came next with W.I.C.K.E.D. and the Gladers. Practically quivering with anticipation and salivating for the action, I dove right in and was quite pleased when this book started out very well, with a lot of action.<br /><br />And then enter \\"rat man.\\" Excuse me while I have to take a moment.<br /><br />Moment taken.<br /><br />This man is so unpleasant that I don't even love to hate him. He's so casual about what he's doing to these boys who have already been through hell to get out of the maze that it turns my stomach. And then? Then he sets them loose in the Scorch.<br /><br />We still don't have any answers. In fact, we have a bunch more questions than we had when we started. And as time goes on, we're just going to have more of them, like why there are signs all over the city in the Scorch that say something about Thomas.<br /><br />That never bears explaining in Dashner's book. Maybe [[ASIN:0385742886 The Kill Order]] explains it. If it does, I'll never find out because I'm not going to read it. Not after [[ASIN:0385738781 The Death Cure]]. Sorry, can't be bothered with it any more. You lost me, Mr. Dashner.<br /><br />Somehow I could swallow the grievers. I could get the beetleblades. Granted, I didn't get how what appeared to otherwise be an organic creature could have blades sticking out of it all over the place, but okay. I understand.<br /><br />But there are a lot of things I don't understand.<br /><br />Such as why the boys keep getting told that things are going to get tougher for them (when nothing could be worse than the maze).<br /><br />Such as why there has to be a betrayer.<br /><br />Such as why the boys were still being killed off artificially if this is a test of survival (and it is).<br /><br />Some of the most gruesome parts of this book are entirely contrived and make literally no sense whatsoever. Dashner loses the thread of his story line too often, and it's only a sign of things to come in the last of the books.<br /><br />But, ahem.<br /><br />I loved it. I really did. I want to give this book five stars because I loved it. It had the same atmospheric wonderment as is predecessor. I even liked the Cranks. I loved this book enough that I finished it in one day and picked up the last book in the trilogy within five minutes.<br /><br />And that's why I can't give this book five stars. I think it would be too misleading, too indicative of the quality of [[ASIN:0385738781 The Death Cure]]. I wouldn't want to do that to you.<br /><br />As I said in my review of [[ASIN:0385737955 The Maze Runner]], if you're a completionist these books aren't for you.

B002WIDRM6|3.0|Like so many albums you buy...there are a couple of good songs and the rest are just mediocre....wouldn't buy another of their cds.
B004JN1CW4|1.0|What is it about young adult novels and love triangles? I'm a thirty-something who reads young adult fiction because it's usually quick and easy, not to mention popular, but why on earth does it always have to have a love triangle in it? For the love of God, can we get through one YA series without some kind of mess?<br /><br />I didn't expect this from Dashner. Honestly, I must be dumb because I didn't see it coming in [[ASIN:0385738765 The Scorch Trials]]. Boy was I stupid. The moment Brenda was introduced, I should have guessed it.<br /><br />And the love triangle cannot, under any circumstances, make up for the slow story movement. It cannot make up for the fact that this book creates more questions and gives no answers. It cannot make up for the fact that by this point the killing of random characters no longer makes sense.<br /><br />Thomas is sixteen (or so). He ought to be highly sexed, but he's not. Moreover, boys at that age fall in and out of love pretty much as readily as girls do, just in different ways. We don't feel that with Thomas, so for the love of all things holy, just forget the romance altogether! If you can't pull it off, don't bother. Besides, if you're writing for boys (and you are, Mr. Dashner, writing for boys), the romance is sort of superfluous. Girls who have gotten this far would have kept reading without the romance. They would have been more eager to keep reading if they had a good story to follow.<br /><br />Once more Dashner seems to have forgotten where he was going with certain story lines and simply dropped them instead of picking them up and weaving them in.<br /><br />An analogy for you, Mr. Dashner:<br /><br />I'm a knitter. When I finish a piece that I've been working on, I weave in the ends where I've started or ended the work. If I don't, the entire piece may unravel. Your writing is like that.<br /><br />If you lose the thread of your plot, nix the bait you set on revision. Your editor should have pressed you to do this. Why s/he didn't, I don't know.<br /><br />Dashner has tons of potential. I absolutely loved [[ASIN:0385737955 The Maze Runner]]. You tell a great story and this series was SO unique, unlike anything I've ever read before. I want more like [[ASIN:0385737955 The Maze Runner]] (though better characterization would be good). Not everything needs to be a series. Trilogies are popular, but the first two books could have been made into a single book and reached a conclusion without following through to the conclusion they did.<br /><br />This was not a good way to conclude a series.

B00E8B1358|5.0|This movie was a good action type, with a good story, and good special effects.<br />Good fights. The typical action movie were you sit, turn off your brain, eat popcorn, and enjoy the pictures
B00BWL99L2|4.0|Some of the songs don't benefit from having multiple versions on the same album (and the Casio keyboard caught my ear a touch too often in a couple of those less-than-perfect versions).  Still, I really enjoyed having the variety.  Feint, for instance, has a completely different feel in its album version versus the more stripped down &#34;extra&#34; piano version.  They are both great.  If you are a fan of Epica (like me) who never got around to investing in/burning the CDs of their first albums to get them on your MP3 player (like me), I definitely recommend this album.  It's not their best (for me, that's Divine Conspiracy), but it is worth the investment at least.
B000T433CO|5.0|This movie makes me feel good.  It elicits emotion and has much charm.  The children Olivia and Sophie are darling.  The English countryside is beautiful. And that's why I gave it five stars.[[ASIN:B008Y7J1Y2 The Holiday [HD]]]

0744014956|3.0|Pros<br />-Looks great<br /><br />-I love the hardcover<br /><br />-Covers all the BASIC information about the game<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-There's very little in depth information about the game.<br /><br />-There's no mention of online at all.<br /><br />-It only list the trophies/achievements on two-halfs of a page and then gives a small single sentence note on how to obtain them and nothing more. It simply tells you what you need to do but not how to do it.<br /><br />-There's no real mention of the stock market or how to use it. There is a small mention of the stock market at the beginning of  the Lester assassination missions but it says pretty much the same thing Lester says in game and talks about the construction company. No other missions within this section have any other tips as to what company's to invest in. There's is no other mention of the stock market anywhere else in this guide that i have found.<br /><br />Thoughts<br /><br />The guide just feels very lacking to me. I completed the entire story without even looking in the guide and I am only just now going through it and reading the walkthrough's as I replay the missions in order to achieve a gold medal. And for the most part the guide as been of no help what so ever. Occasionally ill come across a tip or something mentioned in the guide that will help me attain a higher score but those are few and far between.<br /><br />The only section of this guide that is actually helpful is the miscellaneous section. This part of the guide shows the locations of the spaceship parts, letter scraps, stunt jumps, aerial challenges, submarine parts, hidden packages, etc most if not all are needed for 100% completion.<br /><br />All in all, it is a decent strategy guide, but could be SO much better. but then again maybe I was just expecting too much from a $20 guide.

B00DG86ARK|5.0|Universal is a concert recording by the British band Anathema, released in 2013 on K Scope records. The concert was shot in support of the band's Weather Systems album at the Ancient Theater of Phillipopolis, Bulgaria on the 22nd of September featuring the Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra. The concert was shot while the band were in support of their Weather Systems album from 2012 and their setlist draws heavily from both it, and the previous two full-length studio albums We're Here Because We're Here and A Natural Disaster.<br /><br />The performance is of a very high quality, delivering equally well on the energetic sections of songs, and the shimmering, beautiful quiet sections. The astounding vocal trio of Vincent Cavanagh, Daniel Cavanagh and Lee Douglas, both blend and then contrast their vocal styles to great effect, the rest of the musicians deliver everything with both precision and passion and the Orchestra provide color and texture, really filling out the sound.<br /><br />The mixing job is pretty much perfect and all the instruments are arguably balanced as well as they would be on a studio album, with only the added humanity felt in the vocal and drumming performances giving away that it's a live affair.<br /><br />The visuals are great, with a tasteful stage show in the beautiful ancient theater, a subtle light show and the Orchestra to draw your eye when the band aren't moving much. The camera work and editing is slow and musician-friendly, letting you get a good look at what people are playing rather than zooming frantically from one shot to another every second.<br /><br />The track listing for the main show is as follows: `Untouchable Parts 1&2,' `Thin Air,' `Dreaming Light,' `Lightning Song,' `The Storm Before The Calm,' `Everything,' `A Simple Mistake,' `The Beginning And The End,' `Universal,'  `Closer,' `A Natural Disaster,' `Deep,' `One Last Goodbye,' `Flying,' `Fragile Dreams,' `Panic,' `Emotional Winter/Wings Of God,' `Internal Landscapes' `Fragile Dreams (Reprise)'<br /><br />The bonus feature included is a set of five tracks taken from the stripped down, A Night At The Union Chapel concert, the track listing for which is as follows: `Kingdom' `Thin Air' `Angels Walk Among Us' `A Natural Disaster' `Fragile Dreams.' This feature is similarly well recorded, mixed and edited and no simple throw-away. There are some tracks repeated from the main feature, but their alternative, more unplugged (not completely, but close) style makes it worth having both versions.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray comes in a slim case with a booklet full of photos and the credits. The visuals are NTSC. The main menu only features play and track selection options, and there are no alternative audio (or subtitle) options which may upset some viewers, however I personally was incredibly happy with the audio provided as standard. There are other editions available, for example on Burning Shed  with more extensive features, such as a CD of the audio, but as a cheap and simple version of the main concert, this edition certainly delivers it.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this well made and well performed, good looking and good sounding Blu-Ray Anathema concert, and as long as you like the band and don't have an issue with the lack of audio options, or the setlist, then I highly recommend picking up a copy.agile Dreams (Reprise)'<br /><br />The bonus feature included is a set of five tracks taken from the stripped down, A Night At The Union Chapel concert, the track listing for which is as follows: `Kingdom' `Thin Air' `Angels Walk Among Us' `A Natural Disaster' `Fragile Dreams.'

B0013TXA5Y|3.0|As I understand it, this is the first book this author wrote and published. The story is engaging as a whole, but this is not a work to really dive into - it's just something to read quickly and pass the time. It's reads very much like a freshman novel effort, but a decent one. I'll read the rest of the series as my wife has already completed them and assures me that Cassandra Clare's writing improves throughout.<br />Strongest elements: the mythology and unseen world the author creates.<br />Weakest elements: character development and motivation - it's obvious throughout this first book that the characters are only doing things together because the author wants them together, there is very little otherwise in terms of character or even plot devices to keep them hanging around one another. As a whole they're rude, snotty, and overwhelmingly self-centered. Frankly, it's hard to care about what happens to any of them because none of them are truly likeable people.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love all aspects except the ads. Fun to play and entertaining. Just loose the ads and you may have a customer for life.
B000VHXD7O|3.0|This movie could have been very interesting and moving had it not been done with or by Cage as it was all about him.  Sure, there were references to the amazing contributions of the Navajo tribe but they were all secondary to Cage's character.  Just look at the cover of the DVD and what do you see?; a Navajo hard at work on a microphone while being shot at or maybe...Nicolas Cage?  This movie had the look and feel of a made for TV movie and was a big letdown.  I would really love to see the story of the Navajo &#34;wind talkers&#34; told with some respect and honesty for those who served in that regard.

B00DIMXTBO|5.0|Warning, possible spoilers for Outview, the first book in the series. If you haven't read it yet, I'd recommend starting with Outview (The Inner Movement) Book 1.<br /><br />Nate and his brother Dustin find themselves in \\"Outin,\\" a dimension outside our world and our perception of time, after the rather explosive ending of the first book. The place of secrets to be learnt, the possibilities to be discovered, and \\"too much to believe\\" for the uninitiated.<br /><br />\\"I'm Nathan Ryder, I'm sixteen, I'm from Ashland, Oregon, it's October--,\\" Nate keeps repeating to himself, not fully believing it anymore. As we'll see from later in the book, he is and he isn't.<br /><br /> The Ryder brothers are on the run. Agent Fitts, the primary antagonist from the first book, is replaced with a more sinister figure, Luther Storch, director of Lightyear, the mysterious government organization that is using psychics and their powers for nefarious, self-serving purposes.<br /><br />Spencer, the most prominent mystic and Nate's teacher in using the \\"soul abilities\\", still plays an important role, but more mystics step forward to teach and guide Nate and his friends in this novel.<br /><br />Nate learns, finds allies, visits places and times, has girl problems. He is still the teenager from the first book, but he is no longer a child. He is a hope for many, a threat to the powerful few, but all he really wants is to protect the ones he loves. Which might present a problem. Is it worth sacrificing a few to save thousands? Perhaps, but for Nate it is not so simple--those few are the people he treasures most.<br /><br />This book makes good use of both problem-oriented and character-driven plot devices. For example, Dustin, as some of the more perceptive readers might have expected from the first book, is not exactly getting  along with Nate and some of his friends. Linh and Amber have their own issues to deal with; and the problems these two need to sort out between themselves are not so easily solved.<br /><br />There is more adventure in this second book of The Inner Movement series; some of it will make the reader change perception of the characters. The changes in Linh were a bit of a revelation for me. The atmosphere is more intense, \\"war-zone mentality\\" influences the actions and choices of the main heroes.<br /><br />Still, the book remains true to its main message: spiritual development and awakening. The revelations about the nature of time and space get deeper and more profound. Any reader who is into New Age philosophy will drink \\"Outin\\" like water to satisfy their thirst for the eclectic. For a casual Sci-Fi reader, this book is an awesomely trippy journey through what might be possible.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Products sets up very fast and easy to my network, as soon as you try to use the chromecast app on a youtube or similar video it freezes the TV, loads for 45sec and then plays 10s of the video.. loads for another 45sec and so on. Did not deliver on what it was advertised to do so i'm giving it 1 star and hoping they figure it out next time.<br /><br />I have a degree in networking so it's not my setup or hardware, it just isn't able to receive the amount of data in real time when streaming from the web.
B007P2DQJI|1.0|Battery held charge less that my old original battery did and now, after 30 days of usage, battery wont<br />even boot the phone so Im using the old battery again ... Really disappointing ... It really makes me wonder<br />how sellers like this even sell their stuff on Amazon. Just my 2 cents ...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game, it's easy to understand, the graphics are amazing and I don't get tired of playing it.
B0089MXRII|5.0|I wish Julia Gousseva could write about my childhood here in the US, so I could see it in the way she has described her own. To be able to recall the details is one thing, to be able to write them with such care and meaning is another, and to be able to do both . . . is a true talent. In Twelve Months of a Soviet Childhood: Short Stories author Julia Gousseva transports us behind the iron curtain to a time of innocence in the life of a young girl. Gousseva has given us a vibrant portrayal of what it was really like, and it was not as different or awful as one might think (at least for a child or from their perspective).<br /><br />I like how she took us through a \\"typical\\" year of a Soviet childhood - each story takes place in a different month. The Author Notes, which introduce each story, are perfect, they tell us just enough to set the scene and even teach a bit. The length of each tale is great, allowing for brief reads or allowing us to run through many months at once. The author leads us right into these memories, so that we are splashing in the fountain at Gorky Park, enjoying the party at the Kremlin, having conversations with Babushka (and the other relatives), the other Julia, going to the country, adventures in school, etc. I can't wait to share these stories with my young son. It makes me want to collect similar books about growing up in other countries. In the meantime start with this one, it's charming.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I rate this series because I found interest in it.I seem to get more information on what is really a dictionary and if we can get the real meaning of the word.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Do watch this if you have never seen this. This one movie will help you let go of ancient nonsense.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|The game is challenging at first.  Once you get the hang of it, not so much..  After you finish all the levels, it gets harder by adding pieces you can't do anything with.  During the game if you get to a point where there are no moves, it tells you then shuffles the board...nice.  Except that after you get to the more challenging levels it tells you you have no moves when you do... .. VERY frustrating when you have gone to the trouble to set up 4 or more in a row or clearing an area.<br />Beautiful graphics &amp;story.
B00AEBB9SM|5.0|Jim Carrey does a great job as a man stuck in a fake world. I highly recommend Truman Show .

B00AQ71FLK|5.0|It's definitely the best android Moba game.. Great graphics, good heroes, wide choice and great game overall. It's worth your time.

0307352153|5.0|This book has some wonderful strengths regarding why people should take the time to better understand why Introverts can balance the strengths of Extroverts. There is quite a bit of research backing up the author's arguments although the author does appear rather biased.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the history behind the changes toward the tipping point of Extroverts and Introverts and think it should be required reading for anyone under the age of 50 to understand how our country has changed.<br /><br />Great insights and thoughts about the differences of each broad personality types and the power of harnessing both in all aspects of life.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Fun to go back and watch this series from the beginning. Better than what most shows are producing today. Well worth the time, effort, and money!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|A friend recommended this book and I'm glad she did! After reading this I'm very glad that I have my freedom.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Bored to death. Couldn't get into it at all.  I think this film had potential to be good but you cant have a bad story line and add in Brad Pitt and try to have a successful movie.
B00DQVSTCG|3.0|A few days ago, I received my copy of the MDNA TOUR Blu-ray, shipped all the way from the US to BKK, Thailand. I was so worried after reading all the negative reviews regarding the teachnical problem of the release and prayed that I would have received a perfect copy but no.. mine has the same problem - defective audio as others mentioned. I decided to buy a dvd copy release here in Thailand. Unfortunately, the same problem!! So, to confirm the 5.1 DTS/HD DTS doesn't work. Now it's quite clear that it's global issue.<br />Regarding the video content, at first my US Blu-ray copy looked very bad too on my HD TV. I was so disappointed that nothing seemed to work well but after reading the following statement from Interscope, I tried to set my TV display to \\"Normal Mode\\" and put all the enchanement & extra picture control options to off or low. Then the picture quality seems to pop up as it should - sharp, clear, no grains, realistic color and definitely up to 1080p HD resolution. There are some scences that have extra filters and movie-effect grains but they're all intentional and artistic choice.<br />Finally, I'm happy with picture at least. I wouldn't send back copy for exchange but sometime later I'd just buy myself a new copy when a proper release is due in the future.<br />For the concert itself... 5 Stars all the way. Words can not describe this amazing experience!!

B0081336FO|5.0|I thought Season I was very good.  Well Season II is excellent.  All three episodes holds you at the end of your seat.  The most entertaining show I have ever watched.  I have Seasons I and II over 4 times.  I just can't get enough.  I have been waiting for Season III.  It is addictive.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|This is the first book I've read by John Scalzi.  I'd been wanting to for quite a while, because I've read blog posts of his, and I enjoyed his poses from fantasy novel covers along with Jim Hines.  So, I was really excited to finally get around to reading something of his.<br /><br />When I initially began this book, I think I became infatuated with it.  I'd just come off another book that was really heavy, so the humor and silliness in this was exactly what I needed.  I found it a pure delight to read, often laughing out loud and having to explain myself to those around me.  I found Dahl likable right away.  His back story was interesting.  I enjoyed his flirtation with Duvall.  I found the other ensigns promising as well.<br /><br />The problem was that they weren't really developed very far beyond that.  Their names were often confusing, because the author did not bother to avoid using names that began with the same letter.  Duvall and Dahl, Hanson and Hester.  And unfortunately, while they had what I considered to be promising back stories, their personalities weren't really distinct at all.<br /><br />Characters are a really important factor to me in reading, so this, overall, left me feeling disappointed.  But still, the book did make me laugh, and that's worth something.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfectly, but only work with YouTube and Netflix.  The part I love is now I can watch YouTube on my big TV set.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|... Way better then my old keyboard On my Samsung,  made me enjoy texting on the screen.  I highly recomend it.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|So far the reviews have been a little skewed. I am not predisposed to comment on the value of a movie because of the use of African-Americans as one reviewer did. I am not sure that matters unless there is an actual context. Actors are actors... like humans are humans... Will Smith has an incredible amount of potential as an actor (not because of his ethnicity but because of his presence and skill)and his best work has yet to be seen. I do not feel he has become self actualized yet (Kurt G derivation of the term)... and so his best performances are ahead of him... just my opinion. One review suggested there may have been a use of Jaden Smith for the wrong reasons (rich daddy)... however... there was also a primary theme in this movie to show the bond of father and son and the coming of age story... so desperately lost on the current generation. So the real bond between Will and Jaden was leveraged in this movie and I found Jaden's performance more innocent and genuine than immature as suggested.<br /><br />As a pure Sci-fi with good CGI and an engaging storyline... this movie is a 4 and you will not be disappointed (despite all of the box office bomb reviews where people expect far more out of sci-fi than it is able to deliver). For the story-line it is a little predictable but still relatively unique. A father with a legendary ability to suppress emotions has been almost the savior of the human race against alien adversaries. His son is training to walk in his shoes (no surprises there), but of course they are big shoes to fill. On a trip planned to be an opportunity for them to get closer and bond... an accident causes a crash on a planet that goes back to human origins for this timeline... namely earth. Only it is a new and further 'evolved' earth (if you are so inclined to believe in this). It is a very harsh environment and the son is required to become a man in this very hostile environment while trying to save both himself and his father who is injured. Classic triumph of the spirit stuff here!!!<br /><br />A good sci-fi with a good story and a good message. Leave it at that people! Don't go looking for more where there is nothing else to find!!! Dramatic sequences and some scary images, so mind the kids with this one. Most viewers will not be disappointed. Unless of course they require a little more to assist them in their suspension of disbelief.
B00AZ3027I|5.0|This is literally the only Disney film that my little guy (4) likes. Loves, actually. The first day he watched this, he made me replay it five times. That itself was very unusual as he's not one to sit and watch tv for long periods of time despite the fact that he doesn't get to watch tv every day.<br /><br />Now he loves watching it while wearing his little Peter Pan costume from the Disney store. He acts scenes out and repeats the dialogue.<br />So adorable!!<br /><br />The quality wasn't perfect; the sound was pretty low. You just have to turn it up a lot and remember to turn it down before switching to another channel/app.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book.  Very entertaining!.  Great read - I read it before my grandson!  Reminded me of grade school.
B0041CGP02|5.0|I'm so enjoying these 2 CDs.  It is nice to have my favorites together and didn't realize how much I missed hearing them.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|This movie was very enjoyable and threw a couple curve balls in there. It is one I would definitely watch at least once a year and I would recommend it to anyone interested in an action film.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great and the minions are adorable.  It is a great all ages game!  My kids are 21, 19 and 10 and all have a blast playing Minion Rush.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like the game. it reminds me of those games at arcades. it's good practice for those games. and it can tend to want you to achieve more considering you have to get the bonus coins and get the prizes.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|excellent and what else can you say ' Johnny Depp&#34;..... :)

B00DNDR29I|5.0|I have been anticipating Janelle Moneae new music for months, I still play her earlier recordings, They didn't disappoint and her new cd doesn't disappoint either. I never write a review, I like the listener to make their own decision whether they like it or not, This is the best CD I bought this year, There are no bad track. All the songs make you feel better about your day. The lyrics are on point, very thought provoking, The music makes you want to dance or hold the person near and dear to you...I must have for any music fan! Janelle Monae, It was worth the wait...
034580404X|5.0|This set is complete and a great gift for fans since they have all three books at the same time

B0056TYT66|5.0|I'm planning on adding a SSD to my system and got the USB 3 as well. The install was easy. I would recommend a clean install of the OS after installation, however it was perfectly fine on the existing OS. Windows 7.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Boy,  was I looking forward to the release of this cd . For months, I heard that Elton had gone back to rewrite and re-record songs in the studio. And I wondered what the outcome would be. And I must say I love the product.Of course it's not Madman across the water or Captain Fantastic. It doesn't have to sound like classic Elton.How can it after so many years?.His range has changed, his style has evolved and so has the pop world.I deem it preposterous to expect it to sound like 70's Elton.Otherwise,it  is unique.And, does it exude creativity.He has taken a chance and i applaud him for that. When i play it, i  hear gospel, blues, country, and pure pop/rock.It is 2013 ELTON!My favorite songs are Voyeur, Home Again and Oscar Wilde gets out. Buy it!
1878424319|5.0|This is a book I've had for many years and refer to it many times when I'm at odds with either my own behavior or someone elses behavior.  It's really one of the best books I've ever read and makes so much sense.  Most of all it teaches you not to take someones bad behavior personally  they own the problem not you!!!!  Love it and keep buying it for a gift for people I care about.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book has changed my life. Its very profound yet easy to read and apply to your life. Its a must read!
B007A4SDCG|1.0|Very disappointing purchase.  Can't say read because didn't read more than a bit.  Book lost me when it implied that a woman's cancer went into remission because she started writing.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|I own the special edition that has both the U.S. theatrical release and the director's cut extended release.  This story is one in a million - certainly one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />The story-telling is exquisite.  Acting, direction, screenplay, cinematography are all superb.  The sound track is magnificent - certainly one of the best ever from Ennio Morricone (he has scored hundreds of films)!<br /><br />I won't get into the story or the plot, as there are many other reviews that describe it much better than I could.<br /><br />But I will say this:  I like the theatrical version better than the extended version.  This is a case where less is more, and where not knowing is better than knowing - at least from my storytellers point of view.  Just know that both versions are exceptional, and that my preference for the theatrical version is my own bias.<br /><br />Put this at the top of your list. . . .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really good. Definitely recommend this to people. Great fun very child friendly good for kids age 7 to 12. Play this all the time.
B007SGM084|5.0|Best books ever!!! I was glad I could purchase all 3 books all in one package! Would highly recommend reading!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|If you like the dumb ways to die video you will love this game,but even if you don't like it or haven't seen the video you will still like it.This game is very addicting but I have 1 question and 1 complaint,how do you beat the level with the plane and in the level with the moose you have to press with 3 or more fingers at a time and on kindle fire you can't use 3 fingers at a time.Other than that the game is AWESOME!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I just love this game! It's a great game for people who love running games! The minions are very cute when they bonk into something, ending the game. My only complaint is that you have to be connected to a wifi otherwise you will either not be able to play the game or you get killed easily.
B0083GQVOC|5.0|For a Movie that was made based off of a novel, this one has to be one of the best; Especially because it is such a hard story to capture with it being all about the inner thoughts and feelings of the main character (mother). Definitely worth watching after you have read the book, or if you are looking for a dark but really interesting movie to watch.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Lost my last copy when I moved. Panicked and when straight to amazon and ordered a new copy. Love this movie.
B002OSXDAU|3.0|Bought the Fountainhead for book club and am having a hard time staying interested in it.  Not very into political and religious innuendoes and will ignore them as I read.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Love the game. I do not like the fact that when you get more advanced you have to get 3 friends to send you something or spend money. Tired of having to spend money to play a game.
030758836X|4.0|Was a book I couldn't put down once I started.  Didn't really care about the characters (either one), as other people mentioned to me as well.  A very suprising ending!  All in all, a good read!
0316201561|5.0|I bought this book awhile ago since I was a big fan of Chris Colfer and this book seemed to be getting a lot of attention, so i started to read it soon after i bought it and i have to say i was sucked right into it from the beginning. The story line is wonderful and its amazing how Chris put so many fairy tales into this book and how they come together in one world and on top of that make sense. I`m over 18 years old and i have to say i very much enjoyed this book and even laughed out loud at times. I`d recommend this book to anyone who has a good imagination and just loves the concept of fairy tales.
1781162646|3.0|I don't know, maybe it's just me.  I thought this was a bit boring for S.K.  I stopped reading him for awhile and started again with this book.  I'll probably get back to him again, loved the JFK one (can't remember the name right now).

B004FRX0MY|1.0|Like all music players for smartphones, the music stops when the user gets a text or call. Immediately on resuming the music track, the volume is up FULL BLAST for a second until returning to previous levels. So... imagine you're listening to your music on your earbuds, you hear a beep to announce that you have a text, and immediately you are BLASTED with a music track. Damaging, poorly programmed and a stupid bug that any QA team should have spotted.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This book was not what I expected at all. It made me think. My son really enjoyed the book as well. I really liked this book.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this mouse simply on the reviews alone and so far it hasn't disappointed. It certainly has been a massive upgrade over my previous wireless mouse. It fits comfortably in my hand and the materials feel reasonably good for this price point. The scroll wheel serves as a middle mouse button and it actually works well. My previous mouse also had a combined wheel and middle button but I swear the people who designed it never actually used it for a middle click button. I would try to click and instead it would scroll up or down or sideways - anything but actually doing what I wanted it to. I'm a huge middle clicker and so I ended up changing some of the xml files to make another button serve as a middle click button. In contrast to that, the Anker 8000 just works. I can scroll and middle click easily with the same button without any issues.<br /><br />I think an often overlooked aspect of mice is the accompanying driver / control software. The latest Anker software weighs in at a svelte 6.5 MB compared to 78 MB for my previous mouse, much of what seemed like bloat. I used to experience \\"sticking\\" and lag with the old mouse and never really determined if it was due to wireless or software issues. All I know is that there is no sticking or lag with the Anker 8000. The Anker software also allows me to assign a wide range of functions to any button without having to mess with xml files to remap buttons. I love the quick profile switcher and it works flawlessly between gaming and desktop work.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a great product, a great value and would definitely recommend it.
B001UEBHYS|4.0|The movie is centered on the lives of three primary characters with the two brothers at the focal point.  The youngest brother, Jamal, has just finished his first day of taping for India's version of \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire.\\"  He has been detained by police and tortured in order to discover how he has cheated on the game show as no kid from the slum such as himself should know all of the answers thus far to the questions.  As the movie progresses it cuts between scenes of the current time with him in the police station and scenes of himself as he ages from childhood through early adulthood.  The second story line to the movie is Jamal's love for Latika.  It shows his dedication to finding and saving the girl that he feels a deep connection with.  Without directly comparing the two, I would dare say that it is similar to the Forrest Gump/Jenny connection where the boy fawns for the girl throughout life and even with nearly insurmountable odds; the two finally find love in each other's arms.<br /><br />This was not one of those generic mega blockbuster titles where the background stories of the characters are left out and the time is filled with high dollar CGI effects and A-list stars. I felt that the movie gave a true identity to each of the main characters along with a majority of the supporting actors.  The movie was well written and masterfully intertwined the emotions of growing up in the slums with nothing but despair around and the glorious feeling of love and thus the journey in pursuit of.<br /><br />Religion did not play a major role in this movie yet it touched on it enough to show that strife is found between people of different beliefs.  The brothers were presumed to have lost their mother at a young age due her Muslim faith; it is presumed that she died at the hands of the Hindu's.  A portion of the movie includes the Taj Mahal and shows the reverence that people even internationally hold for this holy place.  The young street beggars at times express their blessing upon those who toss them charity.<br /><br />Overall this is a great one to watch when you want a break from the typical movie.  It will probably surprise you and leave you with a positive feeling at the end of the roller coaster emotional ride.press their blessing upon those who toss them charity.<br /><br />Overall this is a great one to watch when you want a break from the typical movie.

B00CEF014E|5.0|(Note: I was given this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not effect my review in any way.)<br />I<br />Immediately after you start to read this book you can tell the book has some surprises just from the way it starts. After about 3 chapters into the book, the main character Dana started to seem like a very familiar character. As of I had met her before. As I kept reading I started to realize that she had somewhat of a close resemblance to another character I know from a show. The fact that she resembled this character made me want to keep reading this book. The more I read, the more interesting the book became.<br /><br />This book has a few crazy twists that really just make you want to keep reading it to see what's going to happen. Now I'm not much of a reader (Per Say). For some reason I just couldn't help but to keep reading. The plot of this book is surprisingly detailed for such a short book. I'm a big fan of a good twist. Something that makes you think one thing and then takes a completely different turn. This one wasn't as big as you would expect or maybe it was just because I saw it coming. But none the less a good one. If you just visualize it all in your head this book will blow your mind.<br /><br />Meet The Main Characters:<br />+ Dana = The Main Character<br />+ Zoe = Dana's Sister<br />+ Tyler = Dana's boyfriend<br />+ The rest are mostly support characters.<br /><br />As the book goes on you start to asking yourself a few questions.<br />- Is Tyler real?...<br />- Is Dana going insane?...<br />- Did she make all of this up?...<br />- What is really going on here?...<br /><br />The twists that happen here are some that I know you will enjoy. If I wouldn't have received this book for free to review it. I would've most definitely bought it for sure. No doubt in my mind if you enjoy a good thriller, you will enjoy this one. I would recommend this book to anyone that love a good short read, wants to pass the time, or just wants a few exciting twists.<br /><br />(Finally Note: Writing a review about a book without giving away any spoilers can be pretty hard.

B008JFUN6E|2.0|In 2009, out of the scrapped Halo movie, first-time director Neill Blomkamp shocked the world with District 9, a very unique film about extraterrestrial refugees stuck in contemporary South Africa. It currently holds a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, citing its unique story (a rarity in films these days), excellent acting, writing, and (despite its modest budget) special effects. Naturally, expectations were high for his follow up, Elysium. After viewing Blomkamp's second film, one wonders whether he was pressed for time, because it plays out like a first draft in need of heavy revision.<br /><br />In the year 2154, the ultra wealthy live on Elysium, a utopian space station where crime, sickness, and war are nonexistent. Everyone else is stuck on an overpopulated, impoverished earth. One man, however, has the means to change all of that and bring equality to the two worlds.<br /><br />There isn't a singular flaw that can be attributed to Elysium's catastrophic failure, but \\"absolutely no character development\\" is towards the top of the list. Our protagonist, Max (played by Matt Damon) is an ex-con who's trying to stay on the \\"straight and narrow\\". It's difficult to care about him because he is essentially a cardboard cutout, like every character in this movie. The squalor the earthlings live in is portrayed with excellent, stark imagery, but viewers need more than imagery to stay invested in the \\"good\\" characters and their plight. \\"Why should we root for Max? What makes him so special?\\" It's unfortunate that Blomkamp doesn't answer these questions.<br /><br />Some of the characters are an extreme hindrance to the success of the film. Jodie Foster plays Delacourt, Elysium's cruel, scheming Secretary of Defense who has a penchant for poor acting including, but not limited to, cringe-inducing lines unbecoming of a two-time academy award winning actress. Kruger (played by Sharlto Copley of District 9 fame) is meant to be a fun-to-watch villain, but Delacourt's personal mercenary has an incredibly obnoxious, pseudo-French/cockney accent that would be hilarious in a Monty Python movie, but it's distracting and less than intimidating in this one. The actors are not entirely to blame; it's difficult for a good actor/actress to perform well when given poor lines.<br /><br />The environments, spaceships, robots, and weapons are a visual treat, as expected. The action scenes have inventive elements, but they are too few and far between, often relying heavily on slow-motion. Ultimately, the film lacks character development and substance, both of which are essential for the kind of story Blomkamp is trying to tell.<br /><br />Considering how great District 9 was, and the enormous potential Elysium had, it's obvious Blomkamp has some great ideas; it's just a matter of allowing them to develop. 4/10
B004I4H8QS|5.0|I would highly recommend this album to anyone who wants to listen to exceptional music, coupled with great lyrics!<br /><br />Highest rating!!!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I missed out on that whole era of Brad Pitt Americana - you know, Brad Pitt fishing, Brad Pitt aging in reverse, blah blah, it's sort of this vague shadow of him taking over for Robert Redford minus the essential Sydney Pollack.<br /><br />The zombies were okay but not as exciting and shocking as The Walking Dead and the timing of WWZ's release fills the gap between a very good Season 3 and the yet to premiere Season 4.  And on its own, this is a filler movie that acts as a prequel, kind of the boring Pilot episode that prepares for the far more awesome ACTUAL war described in the better book [[ASIN:B00DU7BDXS World War Z An Oral History of the Zombie War by Brooks, Max [Three Rivers Press,2007] [Paperback]]].<br /><br />I won't be purchasing this film.  I couldn't even watch it a second time when I rented it on cable so I'm glad I didn't pay to see it on the big screen.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I have read all of Adichie's books and I stand in awe of how each book sets her above an other author I have ever read. She stepped out of her comfort zone with this book, from the beginning you feel everything the main characters feel. I knew when I read Purple Hibiscus I had found my favorite author. All your books have been a true pleasure. CARRY GO ADICHIE!!!!!!!
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|but this movie was great, from the casting, to the script, to the execution of the story, nothing was as expected and the extended edition was just awesome.  dont bother with the theatrical other then the compare to how the extended was better.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I was lucky enough to get the uber hot 17 track cd from japan, but its basically the same as the US bound target edition.<br /><br />This is the album of the year for me, needless to say her finest hours come from the ballads in this album. From Sirens onwards you can't help but be impressed. All with a super cool confidence. Cher doesn't have to try, on this album she just is. Irrespective of her past or her future, this album will hit you hard, and you won't realise you have fallen until you on the ground. Its that good.<br /><br />Have fun.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This is an amazing book and I would recommend it if you liked the hunger games! A must read totally!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I really liked this book at the beginning but then it just turned into the same old thing over and over again. I may have just hit a lull in the book, but I haven't finished it because I hit a lull. I might feel differently at the end of the book but about half way through I am bored.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Fairway is tons of fun, a new twist on solitaire with engaging  graphics and amusing &quot;commentary&quot;. Hours of fun, you can opt to purchase golf bucks but not necessary to advance. Works flawlessly on my KFHD 8.9&quot;.

B00D8HNR5W|5.0|As for fans of NiN, I would highly recommend approaching Hesitation Marks with the mind-set of a new listener who had never heard any of the artists previous material that way there are no expectations to cloud one's enjoyment of this truly awesome album.<br /><br />P.S I cannot praise the merits of any one individual track since every song is an exercise in pure greatness, originality and genius.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I like this game a lot but I wish the hints didn't cost a lot of coins. Otherwise I like this game.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I like the way the author changes views after a few chapters going from present to past through out the book. Although this makes it a little hard to follow, it does enhance the story line better and keeps you in mind of the similarities between characters lives. Her descriptions of characters, places and events bring all the readers senses into play. You can actually see, hear, smell, taste and feel what each character is going through.<br />This story brings history to life. If you have an ancestor who lived the orphan train experience, but left no record of their own personal story, this story will help open your eyes and help you understand what they might have also experienced as a child.<br />Overall a very good account and interesting reading.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I grew up with the original star trec series and I think this was done very well the cast is so good and the twist on the story makes it fresh I hope they keep making them it brought me back as a fan
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this game is good for almost any age group. it caneven help kids learn. the concept is simple enough yet can be as much of a chalkwnge as you want. you create groups of 3 or more diamonds at a time by color.  the more you link the more you score. it timed and its one of those how many can you score in a min. you can get bonus stuff by just earnimg high score coins thru game play. its quick and pause able. it also keeps your brain thinking to pay attn to the colors abd patterns as they drop
B008PUF3VS|4.0|The book was amazing, but i thought it was a little bit short. My family have read it and everyone liked it a lot.
0345803450|2.0|Although McEwan writes beautifully, I found this story to be dull and plodding and seemingly both pointless and implausible. So I got to page 229 and gave up. Then I read a review that mentioned a twist at the end. So I resumed reading and made it to the end. It certainly does have a twist at the end. But it's one that made me groan and left me feeling cheated as McEwan manages to break all the rules on novel writing. He's used the same 'twist' (trick) before. It's unfair because its not really a plot twist, it's more of a writing trick. Now when I read his work I'm going to have to check the ending first to make sure he's not going to pull the rug from under my feet after I've invested in reading the whole novel.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I would like it more if we got to pick any character for ourselves and I beat the game to quick
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This really opened my eyes on the true meaning of guarding your thoughts.  The experiments proved our connection to the universe and others.  Even if you doubt for a minute,  allow yourself to be &#34;gullible&#34; enough to believe in the experiments and you will be amazed!  Just when I thought I wouldn't see my experiments come to fruition,  I told myself &#34;just be patient and trust&#34; and it was like magic.  My first 2 experiments completed within 24hrs vs the allotted 48hrs.  Try it!  It's truly changed my way of thinking.  I now am able to quickly shift my thoughts from negative to positive the moment I sense myself drifting into darkness because I now understand with much more clarity how self manifestation happens.  I'd rather manifest good than bad.  Totally worth the time.  And very very fun!
B001MKQS4O|4.0|Great movie. Interesting story. Makes me want to read the book. As weird as PSH is, he played a great role in the film.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The multi layered story is fascinating.  It is a quick read and keeps you engaged the whole time.  This isn't great literature but it is worth the read

B00ANAC32U|4.0|I had a similar one from another vendor, but the two parts of the bumper were glued together.  The week spot for this was where the rubber part went over the top of the micro-usb port.  it would catch ever so slightly on various items and eventually just began to peel apart.  The way the OEM bumper is set up, the rubber part is the main piece, and the decorative metal trim wraps around it.  This set up doesnt allow the two to become separated, which should allows for a much longer life of the bumper.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love Pinterest, but it needs to be changed back to the old version. I loved it and it was perfect until it was updated. It constantly crashes and freezes, and you used to be able to pin stuff on the last board you've pinned on, now you have to scroll through every single time. It also works bring up the description box after you selected a board, so if you pinned to the wrong board you can easily go back and change it.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|To start, \\"The Diving Board\\" is a great success and very much worth a purchase (in \\"deluxe\\" long-form if possible). To expand, since \\"Songs From the West Coast\\" at the turn of the millennium, Elton John has moved in an encouraging direction with his studio album output. His work between 1976 and 2000 was, depending on where one might cherry-pick: mediocre, brilliant, crassly commercial, directionless, or uneven. The highs were actually still as high as during the first seven years of his career, but the lows were much lower indeed. More significantly, the lesser work popped up at a much more alarming rate during this long stretch.<br /><br />The aforementioned direction Elton John now is taking has led to efforts that almost completely remove those lows from his offerings. \\"Peachtree Road\\" was as uneven as they've come in the last twelve years, and it was still, at least, a decent album overall with some specifically fine tracks. His material in the new millennium has continued to trend toward fully-realized work with notable consistency and craftsmanship. Elton John has used each album as a vehicle to rekindle or reconnect with a past sound lost since his peak commercial and artistic years. While he has succeeded marvelously at bringing back a sense of excellence and quality, he has, until now, not done much more artistically than seek to recreate a sound he already had created.<br /><br />Now, however, with \\"The Diving Board\\", he has taken that next step that so many fans and critics have been waiting for. The new album is just as adventurous and risky as \\"Blue Moves\\", but, one would could argue, lacks even one track that could be considered a dud. To extend the metaphor from above, the highs on this album never reach the heights of his greatest songs, but, there are also no lows. \\"The Diving Board\\" is unpredictable, amusing, understated, learned, and even, nearly, avant-garde! A few listens through will reveal the hooks for which Elton John is so deservedly famous; the first time through will not be enough in this case. Patience will reward the listener though; his best songs have always been those that take a while to hum because they are complicated enough that once you have them, they don't annoy you two days later (like with most hook-driven pop material). Elton John has finally taken his new consistency and moved it forward without trying to capitalize on taking it back (even if the marketing for this album is unsurprisingly claiming otherwise). \\"Rolling Stone\\" gave this album four stars out of five, which, on their rating scale, translates to \\"excellent\\". I would tend to concur. However, Amazon's four star review translates to \\"like\\"; its five star review to \\"love\\". On this rating scale, I am more in the five-star camp (hence my choice). Still, though this album is probably his greatest work since Ford was president, he does have it in him to take this renaissance to an even more brilliant level. I very sincerely hope he continues in this direction. One or two more albums like this, along with his work after \\"The Road to El Dorado\\", would lead to a strong case that Elton John as an album auteur may be a greater artist now than he ever actually was before.

1781161313|5.0|Its a great book to have in your ALINES stuff! Gives you all the nuts-and-bolts details about Colonial Marine weaponry, vehicles and uniforms. I myself am not a big fan of weapons and minute details, but for this I can make an exception! The book has very little to no reference to Alien 3, which I appreciate tremedously since I hate the third movie so very much. An attempt is made to understand what happend to the marines on LV-426 and with the alien attacks, which is interesting. There is some interesting things about the Sulaco I found fascinating, like the ship having been in a docking accident pror to the last mission. If you like James Cameron's movie and the marines, you will love this, too!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Listening to the Album the first time I had no comment. We can all agree that this album is different than any other effort DT has put. It needs a few spins to get it into your system and once it's there you cannot get it out.<br /><br />-False Awakening Suite is a strong Introduction musically intense.<br />-The Enemy Inside is probably the heavist song DT has ever made in their career.My Personal Favorite.<br />-Enigma Machine is the instrumental of this album the more you listen the more u love it<br />-Illumination theory is the reason why we all Love DT in the first place, this is a ride we all should enjoy.<br /><br />Generally speaking, this album is different, but in a good way. Needs a few spins to get it sucked in, and once it is sucked you cannot unlove it.<br />General Notes, Mangini is a Beast and his drumming is memorable. John Myung's touch is clear and the bass is great.

1609611543|5.0|This book is an eye-opener for sure!  Now, keep in mind it's quite strict, if you've got serious health issues pay attention.  If not, take what he says (which is backed up by many many documented scientific studies) as good advice, but in my opinion, don't give up all your comfortable habits, just modify.  I do LOVE wheat, as most of us do, hey that's our culture of eating!!!  I have been eating it in EVERY meal, and for snacks!  Whole grains are &#34;good for you&#34;, right?  By avoiding wheat for this month, I've learned about many other alternatives which are delicious and filling.  I have not lost 10-20 pounds as he predicted.  I do not feel any different.  But the lesson for me was we as a society eat far too much of one thing, and that can't be o.k.!  The gluten-free &#34;fad&#34; in every grocery store and restaurant will help you experience alternatives like never before.  But as the author states over and over, don't just substitute rice/corn/potato flour products for the wheat you are used to.  Get out of your habits and embrace vegetables, fruits, nuts and all the other marvelous food choices we have.  Loved the book, will give it to my friends.

B009AMANH4|4.0|i I really like this movie. it was done tastefully they weren't trying to dress it up and make it more than it was. This is one of the darkest time in our history and may issue from this time are still here today. But it was done very tastefully and didn't have a lot of stuff added to it to make it better.

B00B4804KS|5.0|If you're not a fan or just don't care about 3D, then move on.<br />However, if you actually enjoy 3D, you MUST buy the Jurassic Park 3D Blu-ray.<br /><br />Not only has the movie been digitally remastered but they also added layers to scenes to make the 3D effects enhanced.<br />When it rains, it's all around. When a tree breaks apart, splinters fly in your face.<br />The sound is amazing too.<br /><br />Jurassic Park originally looked like a perfect candidate for 3D.<br />Spielberg even said the original looked like it was meant to be 3D.<br /><br />Jurassic Park doesn't HAVE to be seen in 3D but you get sucked into the movie more.<br />You feel as if you become an actual visitor.<br />It's really like watching the movie for the first time again.<br /><br />I watched the 3D version twice when it was delivered.<br />I highly recommend this to everyone's 3D Blu-ray collection.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Decades after fleeing the horrors of the Overlook Hotel, Danny Torrance and a psychic girl band join forces to banish an evil entity that seeks to steal their very souls.<br /><br />Two years after he and his mother WENDY fled the Overlook Hotel after the accident that killed his father, Danny walks into the bathroom of the small apartment he shares with his mother and sees Mrs. Massey, the dead woman he first saw in room 217 of the hotel. He tells his mother not to go into the bathroom and then clams up. Concerned, she calls Dick Halloran, the man whose \\"powerful hunch\\" caused him to turn up at the Overlook in time to save her and Danny.<br /><br />Like Danny, Dick has \\"the shining,\\" and he teaches Danny a technique for literally locking the horrors away in his mind. That trick works for the visitations but not for the memories and in the present, Danny is a just-barely-functioning alcoholic haunted by a crime he committed years ago, stealing money from a party-loving single mother named Deenie.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in another part of the country, a group that calls itself the TRUE KNOT is making its nomadic way toward New York where they intend to feed on the spiritual \\"steam\\" given off by those who have the Shining, a steam that is released at their death. The cult's leader, a dangerous beauty called Rose, knows that something horrible is going to happen in New York and promises everyone a feast.<br /><br />At the same time, a young girl named Abra is growing up, and as the story unfolds, the trajectories of these three characters are about to cross. By the time Abra's a teenager, Danny is working at a hospice where he is called \\"Doctor Sleep\\" because he has the knack for helping the patients die. Rose is aware of both Danny and Abra and knows they both have abundant steam.<br /><br />This is the long-awaited sequel to Stephen King's novel THE SHINING and although it's not absolutely necessary to be familiar with the earlier book, it helps. On the other hand, readers who are TOO familiar with King's work may find this book is a little ... familiar. (In particular, the Teenytown segment of the book will remind King's fans of parts of JOYLAND and it's likely this book and JOYLAND were written at mostly the same time.) Also the grown-up Danny Torrance has a lot in common with the hero of THE DEAD ZONE, particularly in the way he can intuit so much from a simple touch. Not only that, but in concept the True Knot remind us a lot of the vampiric aliens in Tobe Hooper's LIFEFORCE and the silvery mist of STEAM is not unlike the cloud of life force that the aliens use to replenish themselves in that movie. (And of course, Dan's team reminds us a bit of the team of children/adults who go after the evil that is Pennywise in the novel/movie IT.)<br /><br />King is the KING of character creation, and the steps he takes to establish the three main characters go back to all their childhoods. The way Abra and Danny connect is through Danny's imaginary friend Tony (readers of THE SHINING will remember Tony) and it makes perfect sense that the two can connect psychically. Abra's talent is INTENSE and she shows up on Rose's radar almost from the moment of her birth. Rose and looks forward to plucking Abra's steam, but she tells her consort, Crow Daddy, that she'll let her \\"ripen\\" a bit longer. (All the members of the True Knot have names they call themselves among themselves and then what they call \\"rube names\\" for dealing with ordinary people.)<br /><br />The idea of the nomadic band of the True Knot is intriguing. They're like gypsy \\"travelers\\" as they move from town to town except that they have tremendous financial resources (almost a billion) stashed away in caches of diamonds and art and bonds and so forth. Rose is a bit like Randall Flagg, the villain in THE STAND in the way she calls followers to her band and the way she wants to take their \\"steam\\" the way Randall took souls. King incorporates 9/11 into the story in a way that's incredibly chilling, and he uses it to show Abra's talent in a way that makes sense but also horrifies us. (Abra's father's reaction to her powers is complicated and also realistic.)<br /><br />There are some incredibly moving moments in this story, particularly when Dan is helping one of the \\"guests\\" at the hospice die. (Those scenes are almost signature Stephen King scenes and after all this time, he's really, really, really good at them.) But the narrative here is extremely episodic and as with THE STAND, it follows a couple of people on parallel tracks for a LONG time. Once we get to the meat of the story and the final confrontation draws hear, the pace of the story picks up and the plot becomes more important. Still, as the saying goes, it's not the destination that's important, it's the journey. Readers will find the journey rewarding.edibly chilling, and he uses it to show Abra's talent in a way that makes sense but also horrifies us.

B009YQJ322|5.0|I was bored and watched a random movie on Netflix and was really surprised that this turned out to be one of my favorite action movies.  The slow motion scenes were overdone, but now that I have this on dvd I can just fast forward those parts.  I was really surprised that Dredd was played by Karl Urban.  He seems to completely transform himself in every movie.

B00ACP3OOM|5.0|This is brilliant. I had a Sony one before that had to go into my ears, but one of the earpieces kept slipping out, no matter what size I used, or even tucked under a swim hat. So I could only ever hear through one earpiece. Really frustrating.<br />This is so easy to wear and so comfortable that you forget you have it on. I thought the bit that clips onto the back strap would be heavy and I would notice it, but I am not aware of it at all when I am swimming. I haven't been using earplugs and I find that the quality of sound is excellent. It is not the same as having earpieces in and there is no point pretending that it is, but it is still amazing underwater sound that I can swim along to for an hour of front crawl every day. I have just been fitted for some earplugs and that may well make the sound better, but I am delighted with it as it is and am only getting the plugs to keep water out of my ears.<br />I really recommend this product to anyone who swims a lot - particularly if you have your head under the water a lot.

B00BMEF6IO|4.0|The Cd is a definite must have. Ever track is so good. The only negative is that the seller didn't do a very good job of protecting it when shipping. The case is not only cracked in more than one spot but it's broken. As soon as you open it, the whole thing breaks off. As someone who actually likes to keep my cases in perfect condition that really bothers me. Luckily the Cd wasn't damaged in any way.

B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Dream Theater has been a favorite band of mine since Images and Words.  Since then I have managed to get every release that has come out and even hunted down their first album prior to Labrie and even their Majesty stuff.  With that being said, I am a fan of DT and have eagerly awaited their new release with Mangini being fully involved this time.  And by no means did they disappoint.  Since Portnoy's departure, it seems that DT's music and writing creativity has become cohesive again and looks like they have a creative flow that keeps getting better.  I was worried when Portnoy left at the time, thinking this might be it for DT, but lucky for all us fans, that hasn't happened.  Don't get me wrong, I liked Portnoy with the band but I do feel that he kind of gave the band a raw deal with his hopping out of the band to go to what he thinks is his next gig with Avenged Sevenfold, only to get kicked out and then almost beg to come back.  I bet he does want to come back now after a Grammy nomination.<br /><br />DT is one of the few bands that I have seen in concert that sound as good live if not better than their albums.  They always bring a musical majesty to their concerts that leave you blown away.  With that being said, this album does a great job at bringing that awe-inspired feeling like I get when I watch them live.<br /><br />The album starts off the \\"False Awakening Suite,\\"  which is a reminder of the \\"Overture\\" opening in the Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  There may be other prog metal bands that blend guitar riffs, drums and keyboards but no one does it better than DT.<br /><br />The songs `Behind the Veil,' `The Looking Glass' and `Along for the Ride' all give you moments to remind you of where DT was influenced.  Close you eyes and you can almost hear the sound of Rush coming through your speakers.  These songs have their own uniqueness and instantly drew me into the album.<br /><br />The album surprisingly features tunes that could be heard playing on rock radio, but that isn't a knock on the album as the song have great lyrics and catchy melodies.  If you think that the band is forgetting what made them great in years past then listen to the single, `The Enemy Inside,' which give you a crash course on the band and llisten to the epic 22 minute Illumination Theory which will remind you of what DT is all about.<br /><br />Illumination theory like other epics that DT has created in years past is broken down into parts: i. Paradoxe de la Lumi&egrave;re Noire, ii. Live, Die, Kill, iii. The Embracing Circle, iv. The Pursuit of Truth, v. Surrender, Trust & Passion.  For the fans like me that love these epic songs, Illumination theory brings you a jam-packed with a head-spinning mix of quiet interludes, face melting jams and, courtesy of bassist Myung and Mangini, rhythmic magic.  An almost album within an album.  Then, as simply as it began, it ends - quiet and peacefully making me sit back and go wow and ask for more.  DT always pushes its creativity into something new and they don't disappoint here but they also at the same time bring you something familiar like that comfortable couch you have had since college.  The band also seems to be expanding their appeal with catchy melodies and lyrics as well.  Like the song from my favorite song on the album says, \\"I believe I am along for the ride\\"  and I say hell yea, I am just enjoying the scenery.<br /><br />From top to bottom, this is a great album.  DT seems to be moving from the Portnoy era and creating a legacy on their own that is distinct yet still what we have all come to know and love as DT.  Is a grammy nod in the card for this album? I don't know, and frankly that doesn't make or break DT but it would be a great way for the band to say Take that Portnoy.  Hmm, wait, now that I think of it, they may have just done exactly that.<br /><br />Forget all my rambling already, buy the album, you won't be disappointed.ck radio, but that isn't a knock on the album as the song have great lyrics and catchy melodies.

B009AP2G26|2.0|Weakest season yet. The new kids are just not interesting to me. The only compelling new person, Joe, is barely used. All of it felt redundant and not fresh, except for a few rare moments. Songs weaker as well. Not sure how they are going to succeed with 5th season, especially without the wonderful and much missed Cory Monteith.

B00DJZR46G|4.0|As a musician Elton John is best remembered for his many memorable singles spanning from the early 1970s to the present.  He is not often associated with consistent and memorable albums bar a few.  While some of his albums have been truly memorable, most have not been arranged by a common theme and often are a grab bag of songs of varying quality.  You can't really blame Elton for that as he's not the lyricist...that's Bernie Taupin...and he has to work with the material he's handed.  Many of his albums are completely enjoyable and some of the non-single album tracks have become fan favorites you'll hear in concert.  As of late Elton's output has deliberately slowed down, focusing on quality rather than quantity and some of his recent albums have been quite good and reflective of that emphasis.  It's hard to believe it's been almost seven years since his last solo outing on [[ASIN:B000H7JDVI The Captain and the Kid]] and in that time he did a staggeringly great album with longtime friend Leon Russell [[ASIN:B003TWP5JC The Union]], and here Elton again taps producer T-Bone Burnett to helm.  It is Burnett who made the audacious suggestion to ditch his usual backing band and return to the piano, bass and drums format from his earliest albums; a daring and stripped down approach for an artist whose mantra could easily be \\"more is more!\\"  But the approach initially yielded somewhat unsatisfying results for Elton, a demanding perfectionist, which resulted in producing new songs, revamping the tracks to fit a theme.  Well...after all that fussing and twiddling we're left with the final product...so how is it?<br /><br />The answer is gorgeous and a bit muddled, thematic but uneven.  The songs here are quite good and grow with repeated listening, but the sequencing is a bit odd and haphazard as some tracks harmonize better together than others.  Nothing here is going to scream [[ASIN:B000001EG8 Empty Sky]] but you'll hear faint echoes of \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\" and other eras in Elton's past.  But overall \\"The Diving Board is a brave step forward into the unknown, something the lyrics touch on intermittently.  \\"The Diving Board\\" opens with \\"Oceans Away\\", a gorgeous piano opening, solo voice and piano and very poignant lyrics about aging.  Stripped down to the bare essentials, it's an insight into how to survive and thrive in life, transitions, how we have to give up what we leave behind.  At once profound and deep, it's easily the best track on the album.  \\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out\\" is as much about Oscar Wilde as it is resisting conformity, speaking truth to power, and being who you are.  Subject matter appropriate for Elton at this stage of his life.  At this point it seems \\"The Diving Board\\" is hitting its stride, touching on subjects of identity and place when it shifts into \\"A Town Called Jubilee\\" and \\"The Ballad of Blind Tom\\", but of which would sound right on [[ASIN:B000001EG4 Tumbleweed Connection]] but 40 years on they're a bit too corn pone and stereotypical for latter-day Elton and it just doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the tracks.  Granted they would have sounded great on [[ASIN:B003TWP5JC The Union]] but here they're jarring and discordant.<br /><br />\\"My Quicksand\\" is more in keeping with the bulk of the tracks, pointing out how bipolar the album is.  This is another standout track that is quite lovely and looking back on his life. \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\" points to the type of filler you typically get on some of Elton's albums.  A nice song but forgettable.  \\"Voyeur\\" was initially supposed to be the title track for this album, another nice introspective track that fits thematically as does \\"Home Again\\", the leadoff single, and \\"Take This Dirty Water.\\"  Harkening back to his earliest albums \\"Dream #2\\" is a beautiful and brief musical interlude blending into \\"The New Fever Waltz\\" a track very reminiscent of \\"Oceans Away\\" with more musings on life; another great track.  \\"Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight)\\", thesecond single is a bit of honkytonk that wouldn't have been out of place on his album with Leon Russell.  Not a bad song at all, far closer to \\"A Town\\" and \\"Ballad of Blind Tom\\" which points out the scattershot nature of the album. Some tracks sound more similar to others and others should have been left out entirely as the dissimilarities in tracks can be at times jarring and will make listeners question \\"what is this albums supposed to be?\\"  \\"Dream #3\\" is a faster tempo interlude designed as an intro for \\"The Diving Board.\\"  The title track is a nice compromise between some of the faster tempo songs and slower ballads and again features some great piano work.  Elton is again looking back on his life and the chances and risks he took...a nice coda for a thoroughly enjoyable album.  Is it as good as some of his recent ones, like [[ASIN:B000H7JDVI The Captain and the Kid]], [[ASIN:B00061X95Q Peachtree Road]] and [[ASIN:B00005NZDW Songs from the West Coast]]?  Yes and no.  It is undeniably different than those albums and also not as strong.  Some of the tracks here would have been best omitted for better consistency.  Without his normal backing band Elton still sounds great and is pushing the envelope exploring ground not previously  attempted in quite a while.  To a large degree he succeeds, creating an intimate and personal album not really done since [[ASIN:B0000089F2 The One]] or [[ASIN:B000001EDN Made In England]].  This is a high risk/potentially high reward album for Elton and if I were a betting man, I would bet this is going to succeed!second single is a bit of honkytonk that wouldn't have been out of place on his album with Leon Russell.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|First off, this is a very great sharpener. It got my dulled half-serrated Gerber back to working condition, possibly even better than when I first purchased it. I used it on all my kitchen knives to give them back their sharp edges, etc etc (insert good notes here).<br /><br />However, I overused it to the point where the carbide sharpener no longer gives a straight cutting edge but a flawed edge (some minor bumps), and in some of my newer knives it even dulled the blades a bit. Basically you'd want to keep this knife for the purpose it was made for, which was using it to sharpen your survival knife outdoors when a more sturdy sharpener is unavailable.<br /><br />...Also, it's not too sturdy, you have to monkey grip a small part of the sharpener while you do your thang, and you risk possibly cutting yourself in the process.

This book moves the characters through their grief and tragedy with often humorous displays of humanity. Making you feel like they want you to be happy because life just wouldnt be right any other way.<br /><br />I had laughter and tears and regrets from this book.

B00EDPFJA4|5.0|i was afraid of this cd since there was so much trash put out this summer, namely yeezus and the million copies of jay z's hour long commercial for tom ford that samsung still hasn't been able to give away yet. big sean, j cole, those were decent but nothing has come out like we had the last few summers.  it's been pretty weak overall in hip hop.  also, i wasn't as impressed with \\"take care\\" like a lot of drake fans were. i only like half the songs on there.  so while i had high hopes, i really had low expectations.<br /><br />then i got the leak of this last week and right away i was underwhelmed. no club bangers, no radio hits, basically nothing that i'm used to hearing from this dude.  but after 2-3 listens when i was about to say forget it and stash this one away and move on to the next, i found myself rapping a lot of his lyrics to myself and singing the hooks like in the shower or toilet or whateve lol.<br /><br />now i can't stop listening. i get it i get it i get it i get it. this is just too good.<br /><br />he goes HARD on some of these tracks. \\"too much\\" made me pull over in my ride while driving. the stuff that he's saying is ridic. and the track with jay z on it, jay's verse is better than anything on MCHG, although i feel drake's verse is way better.  his content is on point in this cd.  he doesn't have any token featured artists like nikki or wayne.  birdman is on there for like half a minute and a classic jay verse. that's really it besides some backup and hook singers.<br /><br />40, or like drake says \\"scorsese\\" really does bring it as well, beats wise.  none of them are truly catchy at first and i agree with another poster that it does sound like dude was trying to be edgy with the beats.  i felt that way while listening, like he's trying too hard to do something different production wise.  at the same time though, i appreciate the mostly dark and non-in-your-face backgrounds cause all the drums hit nice, and it makes it easier to really feel someof drizzy's long verses which take somewhat of an effort to comprehend at times.  drake really establishes himself as a top rapper on this cd, not just a guy who can make amazing pop hits like most people think of him as.<br /><br />very happy this cd is on repeat i just wish it came for the summertime.

B00EDK1LP6|4.0|\\"Pacific Rim\\" has become one of my favorite movies in recent memory, a thrilling blockbuster sci-fi smash-fest that nonetheless manages to have well-rounded characters and a strong heart beneath it's iron-and-titanium exterior.  I fell in love with the film and its world, and eagerly await its DVD release date.  I even splurged on its art book (which has sadly been backordered until December), and when I received the soundtrack as a gift from a friend I was rather stupidly excited.  Movie music is a great way to relive one's favorite moments from a film, and I wanted to be able to indulge in some of my favorite movie moments even when away from the screen.<br /><br />The \\"Pacific Rim\\" soundtrack may not be as memorable and iconic as John William's work, nor is it quite as gripping and emotionally charged as the \\"Transformers\\" musical score.  But it's still a fun and epic collection in its own right.<br /><br />Composed by the man behind the \\"Iron Man\\" score, the soundtrack of this film is a fusion of orchestral music and guitar/electronica elements, similar to the aforementioned \\"Iron Man.\\"  It has it's own epic riff, a six-note motif that crops up throughout the soundtrack and always seems to be an indication of something big going down (quite similar to how \\"The Imperial March\\" always meant bad news in the \\"Star Wars\\" movies).  And it's not afraid to experiment with different styles for different situations, and to come up with its own tone and themes to suit different characters.<br /><br />Favorite tracks include:<br /><br />\\"Pacific Rim\\" -- definitely the main theme and the most well-known of the film, this is an epic number that pops up thematically throughout the soundtrack.<br /><br />\\"Cancelling the Apocalypse\\" -- surprisingly low-key, but a good thoughtful number that underscores a serious moment of the film.<br /><br />\\"2500 Tons of Awesome\\" and \\"Call Me Newt\\" -- quirky but fun numbers that befit one of the more comedic characters of the film<br /><br />\\"Double Event\\" and \\"Category 5\\" -- definite \\"bad news\\" numbers, these are reminiscent of the soundtracks of the old Godzilla and other giant monster movies.  The homage is quite fitting.<br /><br />\\"Hannibal Chau\\" -- this number has an exotic, oriental flare, and has a slightly darker undertone befitting one of the more sinister characters of the film.<br /><br />While not the best movie soundtrack I've ever had the pleasure of hearing, the \\"Pacific Rim\\" soundtrack is still epic and exciting, and a nice blend of traditional orchestra and electronic instrumentation, quite fitting for the film's blend of mechanical titan vs. organic monster action.  If you liked the \\"Transformers\\" or \\"Iron Man\\" scores, you need to give \\"Pacific Rim\\" a listen.  You won't regret it.Double Event\\" and \\"Category 5\\" -- definite \\"bad news\\" numbers, these are reminiscent of the soundtracks of the old Godzilla and other giant monster movies.

I've even got some of my friends who don't care for electronic music hooked on this album. I've probably played this front to back at least 50 times—and I see no signs of stopping soon.

B00D7OXUIK|3.0|I was fortunate enough to get this disc a day in advance of its official release when I was starting a week of holiday. I have had time to listen to it all at least twice.<br /><br />If you are looking for this music with the keyboard part played on piano, there are not many choices. The reason is that it does not seem to work well --- compare to the Goldberg Variations, a piece that seems to bloom on every keyboard instrument and in arrangements for non-keyboard instruments.<br /><br />These two discs contain the six sonatas for violin and keyboard accompaniment, and they are presented here in the usual order, numerically increasing in the BWV catalog, and b, A, E, c, f, G by keys. Liner notes are the usual almost non-existent ECM fare, with only tracks, timings and few beautiful photographs of the recording sessions.<br /><br />The out-of-print Mela Tenenbaum & Richard Kapp collaboration on ESS.A.Y is the only piano and violin version in my collection, and I have had it since its issue. I bought it primarily to have contrast in my collection, and to see how this music endured the transition to modern performance. The consensus opinion of many reviewers has been \\"no so well,\\" although the reasons have to do with many things other than the transition from harpsichord to piano.<br /><br />A discussion of the sound is a good place to start. Makarski and Jarrett are LOUD, and that is not a good thing to say about music that is somewhat starved for dynamic range in almost all performances that have made it to the recording stage. I was originally concerned that the piano / violin balance might tilt to the keyboard, but if that was also your concern you have no need of further worry.<br /><br />Unusually for ECM, the recording contains no sense of the vast space shown in the photos of the venue. The recording is airless and clinical, a particularly abrasive characteristic during the intimate moments of the music. In the fast movements, Makarski and Jarrett just pound it out so hard that the sound seems to come directly from the speakers. I was disappointed by the recording, and it is even worse on headphones.<br /><br />For performance, a comparison with Tenenbaum and Kapp seems to be a logical beginning. At this point, we enter the dreaded mixed bag of characteristics. Makarski plays more \\"accurately\\" than does Tenenbaum, and Jarrett is as accurate as anyone, regardless of what he is playing. But Makarski's instrument is harsh in its sound, and it is always at the front of the duo.<br /><br />Specifics? Listen to the opening of the A major sonata (Track 5 on Disc 1). This is a reverie of Bach's, and it is played at a typical and acceptable tempo. As the next movement begins, we get the change only in tempo; the volume level is constant. The closest that we get to sensitive interplay between the instruments comes in the third movement, but even here the whole performance sounds like two teachers attempting to explain to good students how the pieces should be played. The finale is over with quickly, and it is exhausting nonetheless. With only a few bars of exceptions here and there, the piece is unconvincing and I believe people other than me will feel nothing.<br /><br />The alternatives are many. By the measures of completeness, nuance and (for the most part) sound, get Podger and Pinnock on Channel Classics. The balance, the interweaving of the two instruments, the dynamics ... they are all wonderful. I once said that harpsichords should be gathered into a big pile and burned, but this recording is one of a few that cause me to hold back. The problem with the sound will only be noticed by those of us with 20Hz extension.<br /><br />If you are looking for something beautiful and different where completeness is not required, the 2011 recording by St. John and Langlamet is astonishing in its aural satisfaction and subtlety. Arrangements of the b and E sonatas are performed, along with arrangements of the g, b, and part of the E flatsonatas for flute and harpsichord.sonatas for flute and harpsichord.

B00F57VFXO|5.0|Step back in time ... Jan 1, 1945, the setting is London, wartorn and weary from the bombings and destruction of World War II.  Everyone is suffering, rich or poor, from the deprivation.  This book opens with Ian Fleming living with Ann Charteris O'Neill, who was recently widowed and retained her husband's lavish suite at the Dorchester.  He's not comfortable living in her suite, but the war must come to an end before he can move on.  Ian Fleming, in reality, was deeply involved in the war as a Lieutenant Commander, Codename 17F. He was the personal assistant to Rear Admiral John Godfrey, Director of Naval Intelligence of the Royal Navy.  Ian is called to a special meeting of the major war strategists, referred to as \\"The Boys,\\" comprising John Godfrey, Lewis Blake, Gilbert Hargreaves, Hugh Drake, and Dilly Knox. The topic is Parsifal, where an underground society (comprised of bankers, big business officials) lead by Wolfgang Krupp, Colonel Martin Zeiss, and Captain Franz Stransky, who are seeking to bring down Adolph Hitler and replace him with Zeiss or Stransky.  Ian's mission is to travel to Cairo and bring back Peter Ugarte, who is Krupp's right-hand man.  Ugarte has fled to Cairo with Maria Lustbaden, who is Krupp's fiancee.  There are many historical facts enhanced by fictional accounts as Ian Fleming pursues his mission to completeness.  Author Damian Stevenson has started a series of historical fiction stories where James Bond creator, Ian Fleming, is the true hero based on his real service in Naval British Intelligence during the 1940's.  Stevenson craftily combines fact with exciting, high-action fiction and has done intensive research to reveal Ian Fleming's true involvement in Naval Intelligence where he developed some most imaginative operations during the war.  I personally believe the ultimate achievement in Stevenson's writing of this series about Ian Fleming will result in major motion pictures depicting him as the true hero behind James Bond.

B009GEPPYC|5.0|This is the most entertaining movie I have watched in a long time.  Sometimes it is just a relaxing couple of hours to sit back and be entertained!  And this movie does just that.  Not only the music which is just one song after another of fantastic rock and roll but the characters in the movie I thought were a perfect fit for there individual rolls.  (Just my opinion) But let me say this to the ladies who might read this review.  If you ever liked or disliked Tom Cruise this movie will absolutely change your mind.  He is the most sexy man alive as far as I am concerned and up until I saw this movie, I never gave much thought to how I felt about his past movies and of course the things we read about his real life.  I know he is not a Rock God, but man oh man he sure ROCKED MY WORLD!!!  I will never look at him the same again. And I think anyone who watches this will agree he just blows you completely away. And as far as his singing goes, well you have to hear it to believe it, that is if you can stop just looking at how unbelievably sexy he is on stage and off. Awesome job Tom.  BRAVO  Mrs. Stoy Hughes

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I bought the book after binge watching the season 1 on Netflix. I enjoyed both mediums but certainly preferred the book. She gives a funny and chilling account of our nations prison and justice system. I would hope this book brings the cruel and antiquated treatment, statue of limitations and federal minimums into question. I found the lag of 10 years that passed and she was still prosecuted (not to mention all the time before her actual jail sentence) a complete waste of tax payer dollars. Good read especially if you cant wait for season 2!

6304698798|5.0|One of those films that stands to define a genre, `The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is a well-known and well respected Western from 1967 that has an all-star cast and a tightly woven plot that unites Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach with auteur director Sergio Leone.  With lush backgrounds and commanding performances (Wallach is especially strong here), `The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is a film you won't soon forget.  Despite being part of a trilogy, this film stands tall on its own and has become a staple in the genre.  Greed, revenge, murder and gold have never glistened so brightly!
B006RXPUR2|5.0|On the amazon side though, I had to buy both the SD and HD versions. I could not play the HD version even with current Samsung laptop and TV combination.

B00AEFXUL2|1.0|What I think surprised me most of all with `El Dorado' was how dull it all seemed despite all that was going on in the film.  It is filled with action and vengeance and yet it all feels so passive, so pedestrian.  Despite an all-star cast (I'm not the biggest fan of John Wayne, but James Caan and Robert Mitchum were almost always top notch) the film just feels so underwhelming.  The plot revolves around turf wars so-to-speak between rival ranchers, and Wayne, Mitchum and Caan join forces so that justice will prevail.  At a relaxed and generalized pace, the film plods along and tries to rouse interest but ultimately feels like a lukewarm variation of another film.  When you factor in the quality Westerns that were made in the 50's and 60's, and even the other Westerns made by Howard Hawks himself, you have to cringe a little to think that this was Hawks send off to the genre (he made one other film, three years later).

B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|Brandon Sanderson is one of the few writers whose name alone will sell a book unseen to me. I've enjoyed everything of his I've read up until STEELHEART. It just doesn't measure up to his previous works. It's something of a confused mess.<br /><br />The book is listed as a Young Adult novel. That's typically considered ages 16-25. The violence here is on a par with the darkest bits of the Mistborn books, and it's just generally... ugly. If your 10 year old reads at high school level, probably best to hold off until the mid-teen years, IMO. There is no sex nor any profanity, though the \\"substitute swears\\" (\\"sparks,\\" \\"slontze,\\" etc.) are annoying and awkward, as well as almost never explained.<br /><br />The characters in STEELHEART lack any depth. At most, they're a collection of accents and tics. At least, they're either bland good guys or scenery-chewing villains (and sometimes both). David, the narrator, is portrayed as the only character with half a brain, as he continually spots what the team of experienced Epic-killers constantly miss. One character in particular is an awful mishmash - a mix of Southern*/Scottish/other-nationalities-hinted-at who is both serious, committed lawman and goofy clown. I'd bet minor amounts of money that he was originally two characters in the first draft jammed together in later drafts. The character was so poorly written that I suspected he was an obvious mole, but, no, he appears to have been just inconsistently written throughout.<br /><br />I don't recall if this is Sanderson's first novel-length attempt at first person writing, but it feels derivative - almost like a bad ripoff of Jim Butcher. Clumsy joking about bad similes** doesn't make using them any better. Awkward breaking of the fourth wall to point out lots of exposition doesn't come across as clever; it comes across as awkward breaking of the fourth wall.<br /><br />The book does redeem itself a little in its final third, featuring some interesting action and a plot twist that wasn't quite set up as well as it could have been. All in all, though, it's very disappointing and eminently skip-able. Here's to hoping Sanderson saved the possible awesomeness that could have been in this novel for WORDS OF RADIANCE.<br /><br />=========<br /><br />* Note to Brandon: \\"Y'all\\" is the plural of \\"you\\" (short for \\"you all\\"). No one from Nashville uses it as the singular. It's like nails on the chalkboard to anyone who's spent more than an hour in the South (Atlanta's airport doesn't count). If you're going to write a Southerner, please get your writing help from somewhere more authentic than Chris Claremont's Rogue from the X-Men. This alone deducts a star from this review.<br /><br />** Note to Brandon: Similes use \\"like\\"; metaphors don't. As a teacher of writing, you should know this.<br /><br />[EDIT: Had slipped my mind that the Alcatraz books are first person. Breaking the fourth wall there wasn't a big deal. Breaking the fourth wall in a more serious, less goofy story flops. Jasper Fforde can get away with it; it doesn't work in this novel.]

B008HK3XU4|4.0|Positives: love the color and the strap that secures it closed when you need it to be.<br />Drawbacks: If you have it installed so that the camera is at the top when you have it propped open, it prevents you from plugging in the charger and closing the cover.

I've only had it about a month and I'm concerned that it may start giving out instead of propping my tablet up like it did when it was new.  It would also be nice if somehow it would allow you to prop it up vertically, so I just use a stand.  I'm also hoping that the plastic parts the tablet clicks into hold it securely over a long period of time.

B00DYWKPAQ|3.0|I'm a huge fan of KOL's sound on their first two albums, and I really like their third (Because of the Times) as well. Their fourth (Only By the Night) was a mixed bag. Some really bad songs and a few good ones (such as Closer and Crawl). Their fifth didn't really do anything for me. This album doesn't find KOL expanding on their sound much, but it's got some decent songs, and it's not such a sell out album like Only By the Night was. I don't find any of the songs to be offensively bad. \\"Rock City\\" and \\"Don't Matter\\" are in my opinion the best songs on the album. Though, too many songs on the album take the easy road and don't offer anything new. There's a lack of energy on this album (or just too many slower songs). I'd definitely like to hear KOL get more aggressive and experimental with their music. Maybe the next album...<br /><br />This album has a dynamic range of 7 (not very good, but probably slightly above the average for mainstream releases). Like usual, the busier songs suffer from a lack of dynamic range. The drums and guitar get buried at times. I've heard worse, though. If you're not familiar with dynamic range, I'd suggest checking out this article: cdmasteringservices(dot)com/dynamicrange.htm<br /><br />Is this review helpful or not? Let me know what you think in the comments.

B00DJZR46G|3.0|I loved Elton's early work...lyrics and vocal skill. This album has weaker lyrics and the vocal quality if befitting of the age. It is not bad but not great. I suspect if you really love Elton John then you will love this album for I believe it is a supreme effort on his part to sing from a new era and fans will really appreciate this new phase. I have artists I feel this way about and they may get lower ratings on their albums but as with anyone you love you see through the faults and to the heart. So my rating is for the general public and represents my own critical evaluation of lyric and vocals.<br /><br />I wish I did not jump on buying this before release based on emotion and hope as I would not have added it to my collection...not because it is not good but because it is not a album I would listen to repeatedly.

B00DJZR46G|5.0|The Diving Board is not Elton John's \\"first record\\" since The Captain and the Kid in 2006.  He released a CD called The Union with Leon Russell  - produced by T Bone Burnett - just three years ago. Although it was not a \\"solo\\" Elton John effort, it was as much an Elton John album as anything else he's released in his career, even if he shared top billing with his hero and mentor of 40-plus years ago. EJ co-wrote and played piano on almost all of the songs, and sang lead or backing vocals on all but one track.<br /><br />As for The Diving Board, it was controversial before anyone had heard a note.  Some fans were apoplectic that Elton's excellent and versatile touring band, headed by longtime EJ guitarist Davey Johnstone, was left off the new work.  Fans furiously pointed fingers at T Bone Burnett, the producer on this, his second project with the Rocket Man.  \\"Burnett is a musical tyrant!\\" protested some Elton John devotees on social media sites.  \\"He is a bad, bad man who doesn't understand Elton's music!\\"  I'm paraphrasing, but you get the idea.<br /><br />The truth is that T Bone Burnett deserves a medal for drawing out the real Elton John on this recording.  Burnett told Elton before they started that he'd like to see the Pinner native go back to basics. Not just back to basic rock, or back to organic music without synths and click-tracks, but a piano-bass-drums set-up, like Elton's touring band of 1970-71, which featured Nigel Olsson on drums and Dee Murray on bass.  Burnett attended one of Elton's historic Troubadour concerts in Los Angeles the week of August 25, 1970, the series of shows which made EJ a star, as they say, overnight.  As Elton enthusiasts know, his trio floored jaded, music industry heavies.  Elton, with his voice and piano in the forefront, amazed his audience without special effects or gimmicks.  He didn't even dress up (much) for this gig. With Nigel and Dee, he simply brought his songs to life through ingenious musicianship, and the sort of breast-beating vigor he still summons today, at age 66.<br /><br />So T Bone Burnett now gives us the real Elton, the unadorned Elton, the barely accompanied Elton, the Elton who has not an unmusical cell in his body. His lyricist of 46 years, Bernie Taupin (who now prefers to be known as a \\"storyteller\\"), once remarked, \\"Elton is the most musical person I've ever met.  It vibrates from him.\\"  And those vibrations sent tremors that shook the recording studio; T Bone welcomed them, nurtured them, captured them - in analog - and now it is our privilege to let them settle into our generally unmusical lives, bringing us joy, tears and plenty of tingly moments.<br /><br />Elton has played piano on all of his albums, with the exception of the Complete Thom Bell Sessions (released in 1989 but dating from 1977) and the unfortunate 1979 disco release, Victim of Love. He has titillated us, made us laugh, got us dancing, or made us mourn with that piano.  But compared to The Diving Board, Elton's other albums seem almost devoid of piano, seem like aural adaptations of the \\"Where's Waldo\\" game:<br /><br />\\"Where's Elton?\\"<br /><br />Past producers, including, occasionally, Elton himself, have more often than not treated his piano as just part of the band.  An electric guitar or saxophone solo was perhaps likelier than a piano interlude in the middle of any given recording.  Sometimes, even when you knew the piano was there, it was barely audible.<br /><br />Elton chose noted bass guitarist Raphael Saadiq for the Diving Board sessions. Jay Bellerose on drums, who played on The Union, completes the trio.  Other instruments enter the recording unobtrusively, like a garnish or brush of color.  Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser, the two members of 2Cellos, who have toured with Elton as well as on their own, make their strings purr in spots.  For a couple of songs, the twang of a pedal steel hovers shyly in the air.  Horns slide in warmly a few times.  Backing vocalists join here and there.  Otherwise, it's just Elton and the keys.<br /><br />It's evident on The Diving Board that T Bone pushed or encouraged Elton to be, in the recording studio, what he is onstage - a master of keyboard improvisation, a vocal powerhouse.  Burnett gives us the Elton of the deep, lower register, that sexy lower register heard only sparingly on latter-day recordings.  On The Diving Board, it dominates, especially on \\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out,\\" \\"My Quicksand,\\" \\"Home Again\\" and the title track, \\"The Diving Board.\\"<br /><br />Taupin has come through with possibly the most exciting set of lyrics - or stories - he's handed Elton in many years, if not ever.  There is a knowingness in Taupin's words, from having actually lived life, that is missing from much of his most famous word-paintings, since, as a young man, he was largely writing not from life, but from books and his mind's eye. With his increased insight come lines and imagery of special elegance.<br /><br />Peeling away the layers that have hidden Elton's genius in varying degrees for far too long, T Bone gives us the complete music man, as close to unvarnished as possible, as Captain Fantastic animates Taupin's words in an Elton John album like no other, the least commercial of his career, and the most daring.<br /><br />Now we turn to the songs.<br /><br />Oceans Away:  This track, a gorgeously elegiac album-opener, featuring just piano and voice, is a vastly superior update of Tumbleweed Connection's \\"Talking Old Soldiers\\" (1971).  In \\"Oceans Away,\\" Taupin seems to have spent real time with nonagenarian World War Two vets reminiscing about \\"those that flew, those that fell, the ones that had to stay, beneath a little wooden cross, oceans away.\\"<br /><br />Oscar Wilde Gets Out:  The noted 19th century Irish writer - his most familiar work being The Picture of Dorian Grey - who was imprisoned in England for being gay and, just a few years after his release, died in Paris, young (only 46), miserable and destitute, comes alive in this dramatic track.  Elton's music takes several gut-wrenching turns, leaving the listener emotionally spent by the end.  On this and several other tracks, Funk Brother Jack Ashford's percussion block, most famously heard in Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On,\\" comes through, as lonely and haunting as the echoing clank of a prisoner's ball and chain.<br /><br />A Town Called Jubilee:  What is this song about? A farm family made homeless by foreclosure, moving to a better place, a new town serving as their \\"jubilee\\"? Or have they passed to the Great Beyond? It's hard to say. But the rustic setting, a junk-filled yard, auctioneers playing cards, and an old black dog are gently swept along in Elton's pleasing tide of jazzy, gospel chord progressions, with a bit of bluegrass guitar politely asserting itself in the background.<br /><br />The Ballad of Blind Tom:  This tells the true story of Blind Tom Wiggins, a sightless, autistic African-American, first a slave and then barely free, who brought fame to himself and fortune to his one-time owner as a piano-playing wizard, entertaining VIPs across America and Europe.  \\"I may be an idiot/I may be a savant/I didn't choose this life for me/But it's somethin' that I want.\\"  Elton's driving, classically-tinged playing suggests a performance by Blind Tom himself.<br /><br />Dream # 1:  The first of three brief, piano instrumentals, which Elton improvised in one take, this serves, wittingly or not, as the perfect outro to \\"Blind Tom,\\" with its clever integration of antebellum melodicism and Jim Crow-era ragtime.<br /><br />My Quicksand:  An unlucky person laments getting sucked into a life-draining relationship.  \\"My quicksand/Welcome to my final stand/I went to Paris once/I thought I had a plan/I woke up with an accent/I wound up in quicksand.\\"  Elton sings theatrically, but in a 1950s torch song sort of way. He is wry, regretful, a nearly-willing victim. A smoky, jazz piano break, caressed by Jay Bellerose's intimatedrum brush, is the romantic slow dance.  But descending chords emulate the fatal scene in which the protagonist is swallowed whole.<br /><br />Can't Stay Alone Tonight:  This is the best country song the John/Taupin songwriting team has ever composed.  In its witty sophistication and friendly, down-home imagery, it outdoes `em all:  \\"Country Comfort,\\"  \\"Texan Love Song,\\"  \\"Dixie Lily,\\"  \\"Turn the Lights Out When You Leave.\\"  They are all plebeian efforts next to this one.  Toby Keith, George Strait, take note. You could learn a thing or two. \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\" makes you want to get out your cowboy boots and ten-gallon hat, even if you don't have any, and find the nearest country dance hall, even if you don't live near one.  \\"Things have to change/And they might,\\" Elton sings brightly over his rollicking country piano licks.  And you believe it.<br /><br />Voyeur:  This is the cream of a very abundant crop, the song worth the CD purchase price all by itself.  You wouldn't think that a mid-tempo ballad about voyeurism would literally grab you by the collar, shake you up and leave you sprawling in a strangely seductive back alley, but that's what this song does. Is it about a pervert who gets his jollies sneaking glimpses of embracing lovers through a keyhole or from behind a curtain? Is it about government spying? Either way, you'll love every minute of it, every titillating melodic turn.  Have a warm compress handy if you need calming afterward.<br /><br />Home Again:  The moving first radio single from the album, it is a mini-epic, a five-minute cinematic, anguished longing for home, for the past, for whatever it is that makes one feel that need to return to one's roots.  It's sad - thus, bluesy - and Elton's sweeping piano chords wash the song in symphonic tones.  \\"We all dream of leaving/But wind up in the end/Spending all our time trying to get back home again.\\"<br /><br />Take This Dirty Water:  The simplest song of the bunch, it's an infectious, straight-up African-American gospel ditty with cheerful, staccato expressions on the blacks-and-whites, a churchy, muscle-flexing lead vocal and a mischievous back-up chorus of oo-hoos, all of which put a broad smile on your face well before the end.<br /><br />Dream # 2:  Elton's second instrumental, slightly longer than the first, full of classical introspection, forms the perfect introduction to the next song.<br /><br />The New Fever Waltz:  Some may notice a faint resemblance here to \\"Grandma's Song\\" in Elton's West End theatrical smash, Billy Elliot: The Musical, but it's really a gripping update of \\"Where To Now, St. Peter?\\" the fan favorite from Tumbleweed Connection.  Instead of taking a \\"blue canoe\\" to the world beyond this mortal coil, as do the U.S. Civil War dead in \\"St. Peter,\\" we join a World War One cavalry soldier, dying from the flu or some other untreatable infection in that pre-penicillin age (\\"I was shaking with a fever/When the last good horse went down\\").  He glides from this life in graceful waltz steps (\\"Shaking with a fever/Before the white flag flew/And the ballroom opened up to us and the dancers danced on through\\").  It's impossible not to tear up.<br /><br />Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight):  After the consummated tragedy of \\"The New Fever Waltz,\\" one gladly joins Elton on a fierce, blues-inflected boogie-woogie kick through a pending societal shift.  Whether referring to young, would-be beneficiaries of the DREAM Act (the U.S. immigration bill languishing in Congress), or Occupy Wall Street activists, or a procession of Wide-Awakes during the 1860 presidential campaign, \\"Mexican Vacation\\" gives EJ a chance to showcase some of the rockingest chops and bluesiest growling ever to reverberate off the walls of a recording studio.<br /><br />Dream # 3:  This is the longest of the three instrumentals, and the most illuminating, as EJ veers into Keith Jarrett territory.  Elton isn't known for playing abstract jazz, but listen to this and you'll think that's what he's been doing all of his life.  Drummer Jay Bellerose taps a clever counterpoint to EJ's spontaneous musings.<br /><br />The Diving Board:  This is some song, this title track, bursting with feeling, a misty mix-up of jazz, blues and country, and somewhat of a \\"prequel\\" to the 1976 John/Taupin jazz ballad, \\"Idol,\\" from Blue Moves.  In interviews, Elton has said that \\"The Diving Board\\" is about young stars - like Justin Bieber and Lindsay Lohan - who struggle with newfound, mind-boggling fame.  \\"Sink or swim/I can't recall who said that to me/When I was 16 and full of the world and its noise.\\"  Elton's powerful vocal, a bit Tony Bennett, a bit Frank Sinatra, tops anything else he's ever recorded in his very long, very accomplished career.<br /><br />So there you have it.  I would give this album more than five stars if I could!drum brush, is the romantic slow dance.

B009NY43NY|4.0|**SPOILERS**<br />My title says it all. The last installment in the Sookie Stackhouse/SVM series has come to an end and I think that overall it, like the entire series was well done and very entertaining. Is the SVM series 'great literature'? Absolutely not, but has it been fun and engaging? Absolutely yes.<br /><br />I am aware of, and slightly appalled by the blow back from those who are unhappy (that's putting it mildly) that our heroine Sookie didn't end up with who some in the SVM fan base thought she should. I was pretty sure by the end of book 11 that Eric would not be in her continuing future, but that said, I was a bit surprised by who she actually did choose in the final installment. It might not make perfect sense for the Eric 'shippers' among Charlaine Harris' readers, but in retrospect, for SOOKIE it made perfect sense.  I just wish Ms. Harris' writing of the climatic scene hadn't felt so rushed, making it clear that the author was really ready for this series to be concluded.<br /><br />Vitriolic critics have accused Charlaine Harris of not understanding her fan base. I think CH set out to write a story about a small town, unsophisticated young woman grappling with an extraordinary ability. For me, the focus of the SVM novels has ALWAYS been Sookie. Sookie and the world in which she lives is populated by creatures and characters that are products of Ms. Harris' vision, acting in a setting that is of her creation, with a story arc that is a product of her creativity and imagination. At the very least, I think it is disingenuous to demand that she write anything other than her idea of what Sookie's choices should be and have the series resolution be anything other than what she envisioned that it should be. Does that mean that readers have to like it? No, but they should at least respect the author's work even if they don't agree with her choices.<br /><br />So, I say thank you Ms. Harris for a fun, imaginative series that has kept me entertained since 2006. While I'll miss Sookie, it has been a great ride.006. While I'll miss Sookie, it has been a great ride.

B00ESY77LO|4.0|I liked that the movie stayed very close to the original book, and the original movie as well,but the music threw me off.I expected it to stick closer to period music, not Jay-Z. That cut through the mist of the beauty of the 20's every time I heard it, and it really had no place there.  Otherwise, the movie is beautifully done. By the end of the movie, I felt DiCaprio really looked like Robert Redford (or at least had the air of Redford).Well casted, well told, beautiful cinematography, horrible music choices.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|easy set up.  plug and play and enjoy.  can't beat it for the price.  get it before their all gone.
B0064NTZKI|5.0|Following the progression of his views on life through his personal experiences, writing, and film.  Even though lengthy.... I found it totally fascinating !
1400052181|5.0|I had gotten this from the library and knew I had to have a copy for my doctor which he will get on the 8th at my visit.  I already made plans to donate my body in the hope it will help find a cure for this oral cancer I got from no doubt, my smoking.  This book was even better than the large print from the library because  it was easier to handle and had color photos.<br />Anyone interested in the history of Baltimore and the poor health care in the 1950's would find it interesting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really enjoy this game. it took me a minute to figure out exactly what I was supposed to do, but once i got the hang of it I have been addicted.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I wanted to watch a comedy and was talked into Warm Bodies, it wasn't bad but not so much a comedy. It has an interesting take on the zombie genre which was refreshing. Most of the comedy was seen in the trailers though. Decent love story with unique story line definitely saved it from the lack of comedy for me.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|You don't have to be macho macho to be a cop, truly strong men are compassionate, caring and God loving. This is an amazing story of strength, love, brotherhood, and of God changing the lives of ordinary men. Everything doesn't turn out perfectly, but everything is for God's glory.
B004M8AL6E|5.0|This story truely is one of my favorites. This is just the beginning of an awesome story about some true american cowboys. I deff recommend watching and buying this one to keep on the files.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I play over and over helps to keep my brain working<br />this is one of my favorite games because it always changes I'm older and I'll and some days bedridden so it's great to keep brain active I only play arcade version
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Just love this album. So gentle and tranquil. Agnetha's voice is wonderfully familiar, but not trying to recreate the ABBA sound at all. Far more her own style. Very sweet. A favourite already.
0316789720|5.0|I ordered this for my 6 year old son and he has been drawing for hours at a time.. He loves this and we've already placed an order for 2 more books from Ed Emberley  This is a great book and I would highly recommend it!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have spent a lot of time on this app already because it is very hard to .put down. It makes learning a language fun! It is definitely more interesting than my French class was. I will definitely be telling my friends about this. You can't beat the price either.

031250926X|5.0|My almost two year old grandson absolutely loves this book.  After reading it one time, he was chiming in with the words.
B005TBWN0K|2.0|In the older you could do it, I don't understand why on this I can't, that is a sadness :(
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wish there were 15 books instead of 3!! Loved it. I just couldn't put them down. Can't wait for the movie!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's fun for the fact that it give you spin tokens that give u power up`s that save u and make it easier
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Nick if you're reading this I'm sorry. I love most of your books and your movies, but this one really dragged. I had this book on my Kindle for three months and finally decided to \\"try\\" and finish it. Did I? No, I couldn't.<br /><br />The story took too long to unfold and I usually get emotional about Nick's stories, but I felt no connection to this one. No romance, no boo-hoos, no I'm sorry I love you baby, nothing. I liked the characters of Alex and Katie, but there was no real chemistry and it was predictable. Some of the scenes were like watching The Brady Bunch, very typical of teenagers' relationships with their parents. Child hates parents for going on vacation or moving, parents get upset and tries to please the confused troubled teen.<br /><br />Sorry, but this just didn't do it for me. No sparks just fumes that rocked me to sleep like a baby.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|First off, I listen to all genres of music.  But I only purchase hip hop albums if they are truly good.  I remember when Drake went from being a Degrassi character to a so called rapper.  Many thought he was gonna be a Nickelodeon type rapper that wouldn't be taken seriously at first.  How often does an actor become a successful rapper?  Well his debut album \\"Thank Me Later\\" proved many wrong.  It was one of the best rap albums of 2010.  His sing-rap style isn't original, but he makes it sound so new and fresh.  His voice is a trademark now.  Then he released the highly anticipated \\"Take Care\\", which was a step up from his debut, but kept the same vibe thanks to continued help from producer \\"40\\".  That album was great, but I admit I got a little tired of some of the songs.  After the very good \\"Take Care\\" it was debatable whether this was Drakes peak or just the beginning of a long career.  \\"Nothing Was The Same\\" is the answer.  This might be Drakes new peak.  Not only is he the biggest rapper not named \\"Eminem\\" or \\"Kanye West\\", but he is very introspective in his lyrics.  The long awaited album was well worth the wait.  Here is a track by track review.<br /><br />1. Tuscan Leather:  The album starts up with a Kanye/Passion Pit type sample of Whitney Houston.  There is no real hook or chorus.  This is pure rapping for nearly 6 minutes.  But it still sounds radio friendly at the same time as stated in the lyrics.  The song picks up the beat more 2 minutes in turning into a club track.  Then it comes back to down tempo toward the end relaxing you then fading out with a sample of \\"When Seasons Change\\".  Perfect song to listen to while driving around a city like Miami!  This is one of my favorite Drake songs. 10/10<br />2. Furthest Thing:  This song expands more on the production style \\"40\\" is known for with Drake.  Very relaxing beat with Drakes sing rap style.  2 and a half minutes into the song it turns into an irresistible old school hip hop song with beats that will again remind you of older Kanye material!  Great song for guys to listen to while thinking of that 'ex'!  10/10<br />3. Started From The Bottom:  I used to hate this song when it came out as the lead single months before the album even had a title.  I almost gave up on Drake when this song first came out.  Like most people it was because Drakes 'bottom' was still pretty good.  But now I love the song!  Its my jam.  Still not one of Drakes best songs, but still really catchy.  It latches onto you and grows on you like a parasite.  A really catchy song parasite.  The chorus will be stuck in your head I promise.  9.5/10<br />4. Wu-Tang Forever:  Many hardcore Wu-Tang Clan fans hated on this song violently when it leaked online.  They thought it ruined a classic Wu-Tang song.  At first I just thought it was okay.  But like most great songs it really grew on me.  The \\"Its Yourz\\" sample sounds perfectly placed in the song.  Drake shows off some of his fast rap style among his sexual lyrics for women.  Great song to listen to with that special girl around.  9/10<br />5. Own It: Very explicit sexual song but never profane.  Its a sweet song again to play around that special girl.  Typical soft Drake song done well.  Drake does show off more of his superior rapping abilities over more atmospheric \\"40\\" instrumentals, something very common in this album. 9/10<br />6. Worst Behavior:  I'm getting redundant, but there is another slight Kanye sounding sample in this song.  Very well done!  The chorus is really explicit, but wow its infectious!  I'm sure many will find this a great song to work out to.  Drake is angriest he's ever sounded in this song, and I love it!  9.5/10<br />7. From Time:  The song starts off with a peaceful beat and piano riff!  Jhene Aiko gives a great singing performance in this song.  I never heard of her prior to this, but wow her voice is beautiful.  After the very peaceful hook, Drake again shows off his very quick rapping style with very personal lyrics.  The best type of lyrics for a rapper!  Just sit back and let this track sink in.  Light some candles if you need to.  Best line in the song \\"She said I'd never be as big as Trey Songz/Boy was she wrong!\\"  10/10<br />8. Hold On, We're Going On:  This song.  I don't care how corny it is!  This song is golden.  This is Drakes best poppy song since \\"Find Your Love\\" and its even better than that song in my opinion.  Great backing vocals from the newly discovered \\"Mijad Jordan\\" as well!  This song really makes you wanna just save a girl from something negative in her life and just hold her hand.  10/10<br />9. Connect: A new sound for Drake musically.  Close to the 3 minute mark the song starts to sound futuristic a bit before turning down tempo again, something Drake songs are now known for!  Though again there isn't a real hook to this song, its Drakes trademark delivery that sticks with you!  9.5/10<br />10. The Language: Musically this sounds like it could've been included in Kanyes \\"Yeezus\\".  Yeah, another Kanye comparison.  The chorus reminds me of Drakes appearance in the 2 Chainz song \\"No Lie\\".  But this is better of course.  Honestly, Birdman ruins the ending of the song a bit for me.  9/10<br />11. 305 To My City:  The guest vocals from Detail remind me of The Weeknds breakthrough appearance on Drakes \\"Take Care\\".  But this is again, better!  Very atmospheric song with more great lyrics.  The sample reminds me of something Timbaland would make.  Drake is a good rapper \\"I get it!\\", you'll get it after listening to this song.  9.5/10<br />12. Too Much:  Very personal and emotional song.  Sampha provides some very beautiful vocals for the hook.  Kudos again to \\"40\\" for providing a beautiful beat.  The lyrics are just great.  Great storytelling song about life and family.  10/10<br />13. Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music:  I will say it again, another instrumental comparable to Kanye!  The song starts with a narrative and the song takes off with a great great great instrumental.  The main sample is from an Ellie Goulding song and it goes beautifully with Drake and Jay Zs rapping.  There is also another perfectly placed Wu Tang sample in the mix!  Jay Z provides a great guest appearance, certainly better than his recent albums material!  Then suddenly the song changes pace into what sounds like a completely new song over 4 minutes in.  This is probably the \\"Paris Morton Music\\" portion of the song.  The piano is so beautiful as it glides around in the background of Drakes lyrics.  7 minutes long, but it goes by so fast.  I wish this wouldn't end.  Great track to end this new hip hop classic.  10/10<br /><br />So this is arguably Drakes best album so far.  This might even be one of best rap albums of 2013.  It's almost in the league of the critically acclaimed, but also hated \\"Yeezus\\" from Kanye West.  This album really is a step up for Drake.  It will be very difficult for him to top this near hip hop masterpiece.  I think Drake is the only rapper on YMCMB worth listening to.  He is definitely the best and most talented of the bunch.  This could gain Drake his first Album of The Year Grammy nod, hopefully.  Drake went from a rapper many thought would fall off quick, to possibly the biggest rapper of the 2010s decade.  This is a very mature and well executed rap album.  The album gets better with each listen, like most great albums.  You will discover new things in the songs each time I promise.  Other rappers of today can learn a thing or two from this album.  This is real music.  Even if you don't normally like rap, this album could win you over if you give it a chance.  New Hip Hop Classic.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|One of the few things to come out on TV that was actually WORTH watching. Brown Coats of the world UNITE!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have never had a better app than thisit allows you to. do so many tho.h's than most apps have its ammazing get this app!!!!!!!!!!
B00DQVST76|1.0|I found the following announcement about the MDNA recall on the Yahoo main page:<br /><br />From Interscope:<br />Dear customer, we are aware of the poor sound quality and the visual aspects of the MDNA blue-ray disc. Do not adjust your equipment or call a service technician, the problem is being addressed accordingly. The dancers and musicians have been terminated, and Madonna will be getting further facelifts and singing lessons.
B00AVFO41K|2.0|This is a color match puzzle game.  The PROs; Unique, challenging, functions well on Kindle Fire.  The CONs; No way to win (make as much progress as possible before your inevitable demise), controls are wonky, sound is not great, gets extremely frustrating very fast, not much staying power, not a good time killer, repetative.  I recommend this for puzzle game fans age 10+ that are looking for an extreme challenge in a simple form.
B000066I6N|4.0|delivered as promised in very good shape. big zeppelin/plant fan so cd was a welcome addition to my collection, enjoyed it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is one of the many carnival games I have tried on my Kindle Fire.  I love drop and push coin games and this version of it is great too.  My friend and I wasted plenty of allowance on these as children.  This one is fun, kills time without consuming your day, has plenty of content and is extremely simple.  The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the same thing that keeps all GameCircus LLC games from a 5 star.  It's pushy.  It forces constant advertisements down your throat, while begging for you to pay out of pocket for more play.  This alone is bad, but it goes after you RELENTLESSLY!  Even so, I like the game and recommend it to age 5+ fans of simple play and wait games molded after the old carnival favorites.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|I loved it.  What can I say.  I love it, I love it, good quality Iove it (is that 20 yet?)  Ilove it I love it, I love it.
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|This is a puzzle game I guess.  You bounce monkeys upward in an attempt to collect Gems and Bananas.  The game concept is a failure, as it didn't yield much joy or entertainment, and, as much a fan as I am of monkeys, natures jesters, the sound was annoying.  The touch response was lagging.  I did give this game two stars instead of one for its crisp, colorful graphics and excellent functioning on  my Kindle Fire.  I would have to recommend this game to age 4-10 fans of simple puzzle games and/or monkeys.
0670026603|5.0|This book is so, so good.  I appreciated the storyline.  The characters were absorbing and the ultimate issue was very profound.  I wanted it to go on, but I knew it ended where it needed to.  I really loved it.<br />I read a lot of books.  (My husband tells people I \\"eat\\" them.)  This is the best book I've read in a very long time.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|This is a checkers game.  You try to remove enemy pieces by jumping over them.  The game has decent graphics, functions well on Kindle Fire, has multiple settings and does what you would expect a checkers game to do.  It lost a star because, for charging a dollar, it doesn't offer anything to set it aside from playing any other checkers games.  I recommend it to age 6+ fans of board games.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The new version (0.7.5 alpha)must have just been released since yesterday evening because now my son and I are no longer able to play \\"local server multiplayer\\". Yes, both kindles are set to \\"on\\" for this feature to work, and both are connected to our wifi network. He is heartbroken because now we can no longer build together in one world.  My advice to the developers is to check to see what you're going to mess up before you \\"fix\\" things.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|This is a boxing game.  You control a monkey that you can customize then engage in a boxing match against another monkey.  The graphics and animations are good, the sound is ok, the game is fun, it works great on my Kindle Fire.  The content is enough to give it something extra, and who doesn't love natures jesters?  Plus, you can enhance your monkey by winning matches.  The only downside to this game is that it promotes micro-transactions and I despise those things in a paid game.  Especially a $3 game.  I recommend this game for age 8+ fans of boxing, sports games and/or monkeys.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This bag seemed like a really good deal.  However, within just a year, and with only moderate use, the seams stared to come apart. One of the straps is also coming off where it is sewn to the bag. It lasted about a year. Maybe that's OK for the price paid, but I won't be buying another. I'll pay a little more for a better quality bag that hopefully will last a lot longer. Do not buy this bag if you need a very rugged camera bag, or want one that will last for years. I would not trust this bag to protect gear in a demanding situation. But, for a casual user who just needs a bag to keep the dust off their camera, it may be OK.
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|The purpose of this puzzle game is for you to place fans and other equipment strategically before releasing the kings airships, in hopes that your design guides them safely around mountains and into an exit.  The game has ok graphics, decent gameplay and acceptable content. The cons are that the sound is a bit annoying, the fun fades very swiftly and there are a few levels where the set up required to succeed is so hidden and complex that you end up more angry at the game instead of entertained by it.  Overall, it's worth a try and I recommend it for age 8+ fans of complex engineering puzzle games.
B00009AOBI|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies and I am so glad I found it and bought it here on amazon for a awesome price. thanks so much.
B0095MVOMC|2.0|This is a hidden item game.  In this one, you are tasked at finding numbers hidden within photos.  It has good artwork and is a unique twist on the genre that has flooded Amazon Market.  Unfortunately, that ends the PROs.  The CONs are much more numerous.  The numbers are not very well hidden, making the challenge almost non existent.  The sound is unbearable at best.  The reaction to touch is laggy and often takes multiple tries to respond.  If you tap an already found number it glows as if it were new, making it hard to distinguish which are already found.  Lastly, I was forced to stop playing after a few levels because one number was off screen on my Kindle Fire.  No matter what I tried I could not complete the level due to this issue.  In the end, I would recommend this game to fans of hidden object games age 5+ who would rather seek numbers than items, and have a big enough screen not to suffer the issues I did.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Amazing book, poetic message including many worthwhile life lessons, easy read. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to understand more about how God fits into our lives!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|When this app decides to work for my Kindle Fire, it does what it needs to do at an acceptable level.  It isn't spectacular, but it gets the job done when it decides to.  I recommend it to anyone having trouble with certain youtube videos in their browser as a possible functioning alternative, but it shouldn't be relied on as the soul source for youtube videos.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Disappointed- it was a disappointment maybe because I have read the book and had high expectations. Leonardo Dicaprio was worth it as he is sexy- but I won't recommend again!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is short and simple, as all instructional texts should be.  It gives very precise and extremely helpful tips and tricks designed to aide you, not in storytelling, but in building your book specifically for the Kindle audience.  I was already contemplating writing my own book for Kindle readers, after reading a different book on the subject, but this book sold it for me.  It is informative without being confusing and very easy to navigate.  I recommend it for anyone considering to write a book for the Kindle, whether as a one time thing, a fun hobby, or a new career attempt.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The whole series was good however the final book seemed rushed.  The story line seemed to be jumping ahead to get to the end.  The series was almost like a movie trilogy when the first movie is great, the second ok, and the third you were glad when it was over.  Too much redundancy and a lack of new creativity.
1932907009|1.0|Please, please, please do not buy this book.  It is seen as an absolute joke by the professional screenwriting community and is a complete waste of your time and money.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|Funny and entertaining while very sad and thought provoking at the same time.  It serves as a  stark reminder of what happened to millions of Jews in WWII that should not be forgotten.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Very captivating could not put down! Loved every second of the book. Read all 3 in 2 weeks! Highly recommend!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I want to play unlimited not to be dependent on scratches. They are trying to force you to pay money for tokens. Technically, the game isn't free.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Love the show - the cast/characters - story lines - best show - make you laugh/think and cry - thanks to all involved.
B000002L5I|5.0|very good have not heard much from him in several years kind  of hard to top this cd kind like Frampton comes alive
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I was worried that this would be too CGI, too Brad Pitt, or too blockbuster for me; I was wrong.  This is a very enjoyable zombie thriller that I have watched twice.  The details heard from newscasters in the backgrounds of some scenes tie in to the book, but mostly this movie stands on it's own. Glad I watched.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|he is the best cant believe everyone doesn't have a copy this guy is a superstar way beyond your expecttations
0894803123|5.0|The recipes in this book are easy and the end result is amazingly delicious!  My favorite is the French Vanilla!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a great book and hard to put down. Gives quite the education on slavery and life in the early 1800's. Highly recommended!
B00D6DVSAE|3.0|The Last Ship is the soundtrack to a forthcoming play of the same name and its origins were formed in Sting's fantastic 1991 release The Soul Cages.  Given it is, in essence, a musical score, it may be unfair to simply review The Last Ship as a Sting solo album. Nonetheless, that what I am going to do, as  I, and I suspect many fans, will purchase this album less as a score and more as a Sting album.<br /><br />Having said that, your reception of The Last Ship is likely to be the result of your expectations - If you're expecting  80s Sting (i.e., Dream of the Blue Turtles, Nothing Like the Sun), you will certainly be disappointed.  There are a few songs consistent with some 90s Sting (Brand New Day, Ten Summoner's Tales, Soul Cages, Mercury Falling), but even then, you may be left wanting. Not surprisingly, The Last Ship, is most consistent with latter day eclectic Sting.<br /><br /> The best tracks, such as the excellent \\"And Yet,\\" \\"Practical Arrangement,\\" and \\"I Love Her But She Loves Someone Else\\" could have come from nearly any point in Sting's career.  Overall, however, the album is alienating, varying, as it does, between traditional English folk and shanty songs (\\"Language of Birds,\\" \\"Ballad of the Great Eastern\\") and more theatrical songs  (such as \\"The Night the Pugilist Learned to Dance;\\" my least favorite track, \\"What Have We Got;\\" and \\"So to Speak\\"). Sting's choice to deliver some of the songs in a Geordie accent does not help to make the songs any more accessible to fans of his older music. The bonus tracks on the Deluxe Editions are generally of the more theatrical nature, which is not surprising given the fact they were drawn from the reportedly more than 40 tunes available for the stage version of The Last Ship.<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not you like this album, you have to respect Sting's eclectism and nonchalance about the commercialism of his music - certainly even the best tracks on The Last Ship have no chance of radio airplay. Sting has always been an adventurous sort - sometimes his excursions into different genres have produced great stuff (e.g., his jazz influenced Dream of the Blue Turtles and Bring on the Night), but not always (the classically influenced Songs From the Labyrinth).  However, respect doesn't necessarily translate to repeated plays of an album like The Last Ship and if you are a fan of Sting's more traditional rock or jazz influenced work, you're likely to be bored by this album.
B003Q6D2B4|2.0|Didn't like the movie, couldn't follow the storyline well.  I do like the actors though, which was why I bought it.
0345537998|5.0|Tuff is a sort of everyman who comes into possession of a starship which is equipped with biological engineering technology. He attempts to use his newly acquired powers for good, but what does that mean? He also loves cats. A nice short story collection of starship adventures.
0783226888|5.0|I love this movie!  There was a lot of action, and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  I thought the actors worked well together also.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie for the whole family, would recommend to anyone. The minions are hilarious! Definitely will watch again and again
B007REV4T8|2.0|I gave it 2 stars because it wasn't what I expected at all.  There was action in it, but it didn't really hold my attention well.  You might like it more than I did though if you are a die hard fan of James Bond movies.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I used to watch Netflix on a larger screen from time to time. But now I watch it on the larger TV screen ALL the time. No more hooking my laptop to the TV, setting up screen viewing mode and keeping my laptop plugged into an outlet while streaming. I don't quite understand how Chromecast does it, but I can pull up Netflix on my phone for hours and it doesn't effect the battery life. Fabulous! And I have a nifty remote control in my hand (my phone). Keep in mind, it's a remote control I can use to text and browse the web while I adjust the volume and pause whatever I'm watching. Chromecast is simple, priced at an affordable $35 and works like magic. I can't wait to see what Google does next with this line of technology.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I keep reading the negative reviews about this movie and the vast majority of them come from not really understanding what is going on and the frustration born (reborn?) from this. I nearly had the same reaction when I first saw it...what in the name of the Gods Green Earth is going on here? A bunch of stories involving the same souls over and over again in some karmic mobius loop that seems disjointed and so full of loose ends that you could dedicate your entire life making Calder-like mobiles out of them just to entertain yourself. What rubbish! That is, until you realize the movie and its narratives are moving too fast across your perceptual apparati to take them all in one lone viewing.<br /><br />I understood this having read some novels and seen some flicks that did this very thing, mostly in the surreal vein, that if you don't slow it down, or store some of it on your cognitive workbench first, enough for a second or third viewing, that its little gems of insight and wonder will be lost forever in your befuddlement, confusion and chaos. No wonder so many people hated this flick. It's not for everyone. But it is for those who know that patience sometimes pays off in spades, and taking your time to view this a second or third time, where you can stitch the time elements together and know that they DO make a whole, and then eventually savoring the way the stories intertwine in a clear,skillful and seamless fashion, past, present, future, present, future, past, future, present, past, etc.,no bumps, just smooth transition after transition, is just a marvellous way to do cinema and to present reality, or multiple realities, in one venue. I mean, I haven't even begun to talk about the multitude of metaphysical and spiritual themes like love and freedom, freedom and love together as the elixer for our own self-imposed enslavement and suffering, the ingredients changing our direction because the things and the soul forces we set up before us, or even in the future, time being no barrier here, are interminably linked to us and move us because we choose (karma) to be such a part of it. And the terrible cruelties that our technologies can create, much more fearsome in the future than in the past, precisely because of the maturity of our souls have not caught up with the technologies that use them, or use us as the case maybe. On and on.<br /><br />Yea, one can go on and on about this. Just a damn good sci-fi movie that is not afraid to leap into the internal landscapes of what makes us human, like the best sci-fi of a Herbert or a LeGuin or a Zelanzy does.
B00D8HNR2K|2.0|Some okay songs, nothing that will blow your socks off. Almost disappointed with this if not for a few songs that you grow to like. After Everything was released, I had a feeling this wasn't going to be a superb album.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|A great deal at its current $7 price on blu-ray.  This movie is so over the top in its cartoon violence, pacing, effects and gun-play that one just has to shut off upper brain functions and enjoy the ride.  I originally saw this about the same time as the Crank movies which I similarly got a kick out of.  In short a marksman protects a baby w/ the help of a lactating hooker from hit men for a gun manufacturer trying to stop a bone marrow harvesting senator who would put them out of business. Got that? Laugh!  The blu-ray picture quality is terrific and there's a nice layer of filmic grain throughout, details are very sharp.  I imagine these actors all had fun w/ this film, Giamatti chews scenery and glowers menacingly as the chunky assassin whose gunfights are periodically interrupted by phone calls from his nagging wife. Monica Bellucci continues to radiate, such a beautiful woman.  Definitely recommended popcorn movie. 4/5.

0307887898|5.0|Lean Startup is a well-written book with a lot of fresh ideas and thinking about start-ups and entrepreneurship. Eric Ries, author of the book, has had a fair share of start-up experience and in his last start-up (IMVU) experimented with a lot of non-standard ways of managing start-ups influenced by Steve Blank and the Toyota Production System (or lean and hence Lean Startup).<br /><br />The book is divided in 3 parts which roughly map to 'phases' of start-ups: 1) vision, 2) steer, and 3) accelerate. Each of these parts is divided in 4 chapters each simply named with one word such as \\"Test\\" or \\"Measure\\" (not incredibly descriptive).<br /><br />The first part is called Vision and defines Lean Start-up and its influences. It explains how start-ups are about validated learning and how the optimization of start-ups needs to be about how fast they go through the build-measure-learn cycle. When starting a new product, the first thing you need to get is feedback on the product, so it is important to get a Minimum Viable Product out as quickly as possible as learning about how to use the product is a lot more powerful than research or asking customers.<br /><br />The second part continues with the Minimum Viable Product and the learning. The learning we'll need to get from the product is whether our business assumptions (leap-of-faith assumptions) were in fact correct. Start-ups need to change their accounting system to measure their progress in validated learning. When there is enough learning, they can check their leap-of-faith assumption and make the decision to pivot (change a bit in one direction) or persevere (continue).<br /><br />The last part (accelerate) first covers small batches, one of the basic concepts behind lean start-up and then explores the different \\"engine of growth\\" that companies have and stress to focus on one of these. After that it gives Eric's perspective on building lasting companies that continue to improve. The author shared his adaptation of the five why technique. It ends with some general discussion about innovation in larger companies.<br /><br />The epilogue contains a surprisingly positive perspective on the principled of scientific management from Fredrick Taylor.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the book quite a lot, especially the first 2 parts. The way the author has weaved a bunch of concepts together into one holistic framework is quite nice and very concrete. It is not easy to manage your company the way the author suggests as it requires a lot of discipline and introspection (both lacking in many companies). But the Lean Startup moves us away from the black art of startups and creates an interesting structure, or at least perspective, to starting up new ventures.

B005S9ELM6|3.0|This may have been a Ben Affleck film, but veteran actors Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman steal the show for me.<br /><br />The movie kept me at the edge of my seat and I clapped at the end when they pulled it off.<br /><br />The film contains some very disturbing historical news references of violence in the Middle East.  The brutality is taken from real-world events and clips.<br /><br />This film is based on real events, and is not for the faint of heart.  It will frighten you, thrill you, and make you stand on the edge of your seat.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Installation and configuration were trouble-free.<br />I use Netflix and Youtube, but since I live in Ecuador Google Play Movies is not available here.<br />Netflix and Youtube satisfy my entertaiment needs, so Chromecast is all I need in my TV.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|I was immediately attracted to this movie because it had an incredible line up of action favorites.<br /><br />I thought wow look at all these dynamic actors who have entertained us for years with high action dramas.<br /><br />I knew for sure I would enjoy this movie although I hadn't seen the first movie in the series.<br /><br />The plot is rather nonexistent and the actors appear to toy with the audience and each other.  The movie was more of a spoof on the actors former successful films than a real action film.<br /><br />You will often hear either the actor himself or his counterparts repeat infamous lines from their prior films.<br /><br />I don't know how many times we had to hear, \\"I'll be back or I'll be back again\\" throughout this movie.  Then there are the crude references about Rambo--there goes the fantasy.  There are many such instances as these throughout the movie.<br /><br />I also felt that the dialogue was rather condescending and sarcastic towards the audience.  \\"Oh, dying so soon!  I haven't gotten my monies worth yet.\\"  What a cheap shot at the audience.<br /><br />Sure the audience expects quality entertainment for their money.  I don't know about you but spending $40 on something you're not sure you'll enjoy does not thrill me.  You roll the dice and maybe you'll get your monies worth or maybe waste your hard earned money on a dud--the nerve and how arrogant.<br /><br />Glad I rented it rather than spending money to see it in the theater.  It was worth the $1.25 I spent at the vending machine.
B0049PNOS2|5.0|An excellent concert  Live.  Very good presentation of songs with great musicians and back-up singers . Almost every song performed were ones I had hoped to hear.. Eros is a very good songwriter and singer. Many of the ballads  are very moving and speak  of his  life experences.  I highly recommend  either the CD or DVD  which has 1 or 2 more songs and additional material.
1612680011|3.0|This is a paperback book written by Robert T. Kiyosaki and published by Plata Publishing in 2011.  The book contains 252 pages of palpable self promotion that is rather rhetorical in nature--spoken like a true salesman.<br /><br />The book also contains some sixteen pages of sales and advertisements of the author's other publications and a few from his friends.<br /><br />This an interesting take of a successfully entrepreneur's life.  It reads rather like an autobiographical sketch of his childhood and the persons who influenced him the most.<br /><br />The author also criticizes the American education system for not providing what he describes as a 'financial education'.  Actually, that is not what the 'free' public education system was designed to provide.<br /><br />Public education is designed to insure that all Americans receive a fair and complete education so as to be able to exercise their freedom to pursue higher goals beyond public education--read, write, problem solve, perform mathematical calculations, think, and create.  My Dad and family never expected public education, that was designed for the masses, to go beyond what it was designed to do.<br /><br />This is what a carefully chosen institute of higher education is designed to provide, and this is also where parental guidance comes into play.<br /><br />I began learning about the land acquisition success of my family when I was but 3 years old.  I always wondered why we always owned so much land that other people lived on while other families owned just one house.  It's how we made our living, and my Grandmother was the brain behind this premise.  We are now just carrying the torch.  Her two sisters also were magnificent examples.  Her daughter, my 80 year old aunt, has been a fiercely independent business woman by implementing what she calls the land baron mentality that she learned from her mother and aunts.<br /><br />When I was about 5 years old, I went with my Dad to collect rents.  Although he also held down 2 full time jobs (corporate janitor and landscaping), I knew that rent collection was a very important part of my Dad's life.  He didn't just collect rent for the properties my Grandmother owned, but he also collected for my Aunt's properties as well.<br /><br />Hence, the acquisition of real property feels as natural to me as owning a closet full of shoes is for most woman.  I once heard an elderly man state, &#34;Don't invest in things that depreciate (clothing, cars, and material things that have no real value), but rather invest in things that appreciate (land, commodities, businesses, precious metals, and precious stones).&#34;  I took this to heart because tit reminded me so much of my family.<br /><br />The comparisons the author makes between his rich Dad (uneducated) and his poor Dad (educated) strike me as somewhat narrow.  It rather suggests that education is a hindrance to obtaining assets and financial freedom.  But rather consider that his parent my have been someone who may not have had vision or fortitude--not a risk taker and fearful of setbacks.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily blame the American education system for this obvious personality flaw.  My siblings and I grew up in the same household listening to the same mantras, but not everyone made the decision to follow the template.<br /><br />My Dad gave me a financial education and financial alternatives beyond just merely having a j-o-b.<br /><br />If you are looking for information or a guide to how to achieve success in this particular instance, you will not find it in this publication.  I actually didn't learn anything beyond what my Grandmother, Great Aunts, Dad, and my Aunt taught me about obtaining wealth and becoming independent of the rat race.<br /><br />I was hoping to learn something new and fascinating from this very successful person. My family has been in the land acquisition business for centuries and that is how they've survived and flourished.  They have bought, sold, rented, and flipped real estate prior to my birth.  Many of my siblings and relatives continue to carry the torch.<br /><br />It's a nice read if you like autobiographies, but other than that it lacks genuine insightfulness and any real information that could actual translated into true systematic action.

B000NDMRCS|5.0|I am typically not a Dennis Quaid fan, but I truly enjoyed the father-son dynamics of this movie.<br /><br />The driven paleoclimatologist (weather scientist) Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) devotes his life to crusading for environmental change while trying to rear a responsible son, Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhall,) with character.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhall gives a truly outstanding performance as the understanding, but somewhat neglected son of a brilliant scientist.<br /><br />Sela Ward plays Quaid's equally driven wife Dr. Lucy Hall.  Although her performance is somewhat small, she is superior. Her character is so well developed that she brings a whole new dynamic to the film--I can relate.<br /><br />This is a father-son bonding movie at its best.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the film's all encompassing global message that we are all connected and actually live on one planet despite our belief to the contrary.  There are so many  heightened consciousness lessons in this film.<br /><br />Here are just a few:<br /><br />Money wont save you when the world is in a crisis.<br />Race is superficial, human is what matters.<br />Make disaster preparations for your animals.<br />No one has greater love than to give their life in behalf of their friend.<br />Environmental friendly is human friendly.<br />Third-world?  What!<br /><br />I flipped over the the final speech by the new President/former VP:<br /><br />\\"These past few days have left us all with a profound sense of humility in the face of nature's destructive power. For years, we operated under the belief that we could continue consuming our planet's natural resources, without consequence. We were wrong. I was wrong. The fact that my first address to you comes from a consulate on foreign soil is a testament to our changed reality. Not only Americans, but people all around the globe have become guests in the nations we once called 'the third world'. In our time of need they have taken us in and sheltered us, and I am deeply grateful for their hospitality. ... For days now, we have despaired about the fate of the people who are trapped in the North. Today, there is cause for hope. Only a few hours ago, I received word that a small group of people survived in New York City, against all odds and in the face of tremendous adversity. I've ordered an immediate search-and-rescue mission to bring them home- and to look for more survivors.\\"<br /><br />We need more films that raise our consciousness and promote genuine character.  Superb!

B0076DEJMO|5.0|[E-BOOK VERSION]<br /><br />This is a fantastic book; realistic characters, engaging dialogue, intriguing plot, & unpredictable ends. Just like Mr. Abercrombie's other novels. My only complaints is the editing, which at least one other reviewer mentioned.<br /><br />Error #1 - The use of single-quotes rather than double-quotes throughout the whole book, with 2 exceptions of where single-quotes should have been used but double-quotes were used instead.<br /><br />Error #2 - About half of the time (maybe a little less), the beginning quote was missing, leaving only the end quote, leaving you to re-read that part again. Difficult to understand if a character was seeing or thinking something, or actually speaking.<br /><br />Error #3 - Throughout the book there were multiple characters speaking inside a single paragraph, leaving you to re-read that paragraph again to understand who is saying what.<br /><br />Despite these errors, this book still deserves a 5/5. A book should be judged on the content, not the editor.<br /><br />As a side-note, I have read Joe Abercrombie's other books via e-book format - Best Served Cold, & The Heroes - and did not experience these errors. The author's First Law trilogy I've read paperback, so unable to gave feedback on the e-book editing done with those 3 books.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Followed the Catching Fire storyline extremely well and continued to be an interesting second in line with the trilogy story.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|To be fair to the director it's hard to top the Epic Saga of LOTR Trilogy, and anyone who has read the Book would likely expect a lighter and less epic adventure then the Lord of the Rings.  Still I was expecting a series movie with a decent story and great dialog.  Unfortunately this film is greatly dumbed down.  The Trolls are dumber, the action scenes are very cliche, and the introduction of the BROWN WIZARD is real shift from what was an amazing Saga, to a Cartoonish Spinoff.  This Film reminded me so much of Star Wars the Phantom Menace. When George Lucus produced the Prequels, they really seemed to be cheap imitations of what was once original and mesmerizing.  They had amazing Special Effects and Stunning Computer Graphics, but the character lines were cheesy, the storyline dull and unoriginal, action scenes were punctuated by long drawn out awkward scenes, and of coarse Jar Jar Binks.  The Hobbit bears many of the same shortcomings.  The dialogue is not that great, there many long drawn out scenes punctuated by action scenes that come across as more comical and childish then serious.  Worst of all is that Jar Jar Binks-like character, The Brown Wizzard, No offense to Mr. Binks, he's the man if your a kid, but cartoonish characters don't belong in classic epics made for adults. They belong in Pixir or Disney movies for young kids who don't care about dialog or plot but just want to see something witty with some action scenes. The scene of The Brown Wizzard flying through the forest on a sled pulled by deer was a real turnoff for me, and made me think I was watching a children's movie. This film is great if your Eleven, or Seven, or even 14, but if your 25 and older and enjoy serious movies with a complex plot and well written scenes, then you may be in for an Unexpected Travesty.

1595141715|2.0|I thought the book might be good and for a penny it was okay. Bad bad book i give it two stars for the creativity, however it was just a girl who blamed everyone else for the reason why she took her life, because nobody cared enough to help her when the clay did try to she ended up pushing him away, and every time he made eye contact with  her at the school after the night they shared a kissed together she'd always looked away. She gave up on herself because she felt everyone else had given up at her, yes she had to listen to someone be raped when she could of stopped it, yes people are fakes, liars in high school, but thats not the end of it. She saw a solution to her current problem, she wanted to end what she was feeling and not fight it any longer when in truth it does get better after high school, even if nobody is there to help. I went through the same thing, failed an attempted, but i surived and i managed to get on with my life.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|Enough has been said to provide plenty of summaries, historical accuracy, religious prejudice and Mel Gibson's personality faults and traits.  I am only concerned with the quality of the transfer of this film's audio and video from Standard Def to Blu Ray.  Here goes.<br /><br />VIDEO....<br />  The transfer to Blu Ray is excellent.  Film grain is not noticeable anywhere and details in the many dark or shadow areas are clearly discernible.  Colors are rich and accurate with no false color grading that I could tell.  Most of the lighting used in the film was shot with fairly warm tones and, even though this films takes place in the mid East, you do not get that golden, overly bright color grading that you see in many of the war and espionage films that take place in the middle East i.e. The Green Zone, Jarhead, The Kingdom and many others.  At no time did I see any  artifacting or aliasing throughout the film.  The film is letterboxed with bars on top and bottom but that doesn't bother me.  Mbps rate tends to average in the lower to mid twenties.<br /><br />AUDIO...<br />  On Blu Ray you get a lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 audio codec that, though I was reading the English subtitles, provided for clean and transparent sound.  While there is some directional use of foley fx to the front sides, both the front and rear surrounds are primarily used for ambient crowd noise.  However, they used them well and the audio was definitely immersive in many scenes.  There are a great number of language subtitles to choose from and there is no English dubbing as Mr. Gibson had intended.<br /><br />EXTRAS...<br />  While I did not own the Standard Def version, I had seen it a couple of times and it appeared pretty clean to me at the time. Thus, I do not think that this film was wholly remastered for Blu Ray but I do believe that they reformatted it from a very clean mother master.  This is a 2 disc set, I watched the theatrical release.  The other version is supposed to have been edited for kids to see without being exposed to the many scenes of extreme violence and torture.  Other extras include 2 deleted scenes that come without any subtitles but I had no problem getting the gist of what the characters were saying.  The other extras surely came on the Standard Definition release as they were all in a 4:3 aspect ration.  These extras were interviews with Mel Gibson and cast regarding the writing, directing and acting within the film.  Basically, it is one long extra that has been cut into several sub chapters regarding the film.  One extra, which I did try, was a fact pop up which came on during the playing of the movie.  I was expecting historical facts or opinions but the pop ups were either biblical quotations or facts about the lighting, sets, or studio where scenes were shot.  Disappointed in that.<br /><br />All in all, while this is not a film I will watch frequently, the transfer to Blu Ray does deserve the 5 stars I gave it for its clean video and lossless audio.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of a film's transfer and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase as well as any number of my other reviews might.<br />Thanks for reading.or kids to see without being exposed to the many scenes of extreme violence and torture.

B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I went into Dredd with no expectations and surprisingly had a blast watching it. If you're in the mood for a fun, dumb and visually entertaining movie Dredd is an excellent choice. Great musical score as well.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|Good story, well told, well acted.  Wonderful scenery. I really liked that the mothers situation after the accident was there but not right up front in the story.  It really was about the family.
B00340ESIS|4.0|This book is written very clearly and is perfect for the beginner screenwriter. I had read several screenwriting books and taken a few classes before I read this, so there wasn't a ton of new information for me. However, this book is all the rage in Hollywood and the terms it creates (from &#34;Save the Cat&#34; to &#34;Mumbo Jumbo&#34;) get used a lot. It's worth reading (even if you feel you know your stuff) so that you know what other writers/managers/producers are talking about when they reference it.<br /><br />It's a quick and enjoyable read with good tips. It's not the only way to write a screenplay, but it will give you a beat sheet that has proven successful again and again. Just remember that not every story can or should fit into that mold.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|I can't wait to burn this album and listen to their new music! I hope it is different from their previous albums.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Avengers is full of action and humor.  The bonus features give some interesting background to the making of the movie and some of the back stories of the main characters.  The blu ray discs arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B00BGI08GG|3.0|In terms of the show itself, the episodes are hit and miss. It does try to emulate the Nolan Batman franchise in it's dark and gritty tone. A lot of the dialogue is overly hammed up and can be pretty on the nose. The writers would do well to punch it up and try to make things a bit more witty. Even jokes or funny scenes tend to fall a bit flat because it's difficult to tell whether or not the characters are being serious. That being said, the overall plot is well written and most of the acting is pretty damn good, especially given the aforementioned dialogue with which they have to work. It's well shot and the action scenes are well choreographed. Depending on the episode, the show does suffer from Hollywood's obsession with putting the camera really close to the action when and shaking it so that it's impossible to tell what's going on. That's something I really hope they refrain from in season two.<br /><br />I watched the entire season on regular network TV and couldn't help but think that the show looked really awful. I didn't know why. It was shot on an Arri Alexa, which is the same camera really fantastic looking movies like \\"The Avengers\\" or \\"Skyfall\\" were shot on. It's becoming an industry standard for television. The show should have looked much better. Fortunately, it does improve tremendously on Blu-Ray. A lot of finer details become visible. Oliver's bow has all sorts of markings and symbols on it which were practically invisible when watching the show on the CW. I'm watching on the same TV but things are so much clearer.<br /><br />My last note about the Blu-Ray itself is the lack of special features. There are a couple of nice featurettes but they aren't particularly long. Given the fact that the show is drawing from a ridiculously large amount of source material, some more background info and behind the scenes would be nice. Also, there aren't any episode commentaries. This just seems a little lazy. Times have changed. We have DVR's and Amazon InstantVideo and Hulu Plus. We can get the entire series no problem. If someone is going to shell out the extra money for the discs, I think there should be a bit of real extra content.

B004PGNB1K|4.0|Interesting characters, unexpected plot twists (refreshing in the usually scripted fantasy genre), it rollicks along. All in all, a great read.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoy the game, play everyday.  The number called is so frustrating, because the round is over instantaneously.  No time to act on that last number which I feel is not right at all
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|-Noteworthy Tracks<br />  -Own It<br />  -Worst Behavior<br />  -From Time (Ft. Jhene Aiko)<br />  -Come Thru<br /><br />  Nothing was the same, where to begin?  I would probably start with saying that in my opinion drakes best album thus far. Never been a huge huge fan of drake only really like a few cuts off marvins room,  Often listen to old school rap but still respect the new cats that deserve it.  This album strays away from the marvins room feel but still brings great raps over unique beats.  Most of the songs give meaning and tell a story not just money money money diamond talk.  Waiting for vinyl drop to add to my collection
0345529057|4.0|Loving the story. It's gonna be a while before I'm through them all. Then I'll watch the series. A few months from now
0143118757|5.0|It was easy, fast and convenient. I strongly recommend to anyone. It was a pretty interesting experience and the book is in perfect shape.
B000003S5G|5.0|I had this one in CD when it came out but I lost it and now I´m glad that i could found this vinyl edition. Sounds really great
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|The first new Star Trek, taken in a new direction is great !!! THIS WILL BLOW YOUR MIND !!! An Absolute MUST HAVE !!!!<br />Excellent in all ways.... ' Better buckle up....it is one heck of a ride '...... !!!!!!
B00F35B8F8|4.0|The movie kept to the original script within reason.  As an old Trekkie from the original series from the 60's, I thought it held close enough to the original to keep the interests of those of us who saw the original series.  Definitely a good movie.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Really enjoyed this new direction for Star Trek. Gene would be proud, I'm sure ! Quality - Excellent, Extra's Fantastic - price and delivery - OUTSTANDING !!!
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|This review is for the free version.  Very nicely done implementation of backgammon, with fast and elegant interface, nice user controls, and good documentation.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the computer opponent seems to follow a flawed strategy with its end game in that it doesn't try to get its pieces off the board as soon as possible.  Also it seems slow to double when the game is winning and quick to accept doubles when I'm winning.  All in all, it's just challenging enough for me to make it interesting at level 5.<br /><br />As for the random dice generator, I don't agree that the computer cheats, but it doesn't seem to have a true uniform distribution (where each of the six sides of each die is equally likely).  In one of my first dozen games it gave me the same roll three turns in a row, and it does seem to roll an awful lot of doubles.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE collection !! Quality is excellent and the extra interviews / commentaries are very well done ! I am really happy with the product, price, and delivery !!!! Amazon.com is THEE WAY TO GO !!! Keep up the good work Amazon !! (-:)
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|I saw this at an Ipic theater and was totally blown away.  Dream Theater has produced a number of excellent DVD releases and this one is no exception.<br /><br />Although part of this rating is for the excellent picture and sound from the theater the camera work is exceptional.  John and Jordan are masters of technique and this film does the best of any release of showing what they do.  Mangini is really fun to watch and his speed is truly amazing.  John fills the bottom at a level consistent with everybody else in the band.  On the ballads James is excellent and he is pretty good on the faster stuff.<br /><br />The real strength of this is showing this band is incredibly tight while they are all playing individual parts that are extremely difficult.<br /><br />If you are a fan you have probably already decided to buy this.  If you are on the fence get it, you won't be disappointed.
B00C8RCI80|5.0|I can't say enough about the quality of this movie ! On ALL LEVELS !!! Like ' Star Wars ' and it's unconventional presentation - out of order in ' time line '.... This movie really is a wonderfull addition to the X_MEN movies. WELL DONE !!!!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Given the number of good zombie films and TV shows around, together with the pedigree of the source material that World War Z is based upon, I was expecting something really great. Sadly, this is a lazy, messy, cobbled together effort that at best might keep you entertained on a plane for two hours. It's really frustrating since there could have been a classic film in here and instead all the rewrites and budget overruns shine through.<br /><br />Basically, World War Z is one is the least engaging big blockbuster flicks in a while and ditches absolutely everything that made the book so hard to put down. The film is in such a hurry to get into the action that we hardly learn anything about the hero (apart from 'all he does is make pancakes' according to his daughter) and it rapidly dives into an absurd survivalist flick that's a generic rehash of everything we've seen before. It's a story that suffers from having too few significant characters (staggering, given the breadth of the book) and hopes that Pitt can carry the weight of the film all by himself.<br /><br />The plot lurches from one insanely bad situation to another with increasingly ludicrous coincidences that save Brad Pitt and leave every else as zombie fodder. In between surviving car and planes crashes, we're taken on a global tour connected by the flimsiest of evidence (\\"there was an memo with the word 'zombie'!\\" - seriously). Nothing Brad says makes much sense either - he advises that keeping moving is the most important strategy in a disaster, yet everyone he makes move then dies. There are completely out of place characters such as the armed druggie in the pharmacy who helps with meds and the indistinguishable WHO doctors listed in the credits WHO Doctor 1, 2, 3, etc. And while most action films escalate the tension, WWZ does the opposite with a banale finale that might have passed in one of the first episodes of a TV show but not a major film.<br /><br />WWZ is yet another big budget cinematic disappointment this year - I'd recommend checking out the book instead.pointment this year - I'd recommend checking out the book instead.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Oblivion is all that a sci fi fan may expect. Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, and all the crew did a fantastic job !!!! It's also a movie for those who like multi layered plots and several twists that end up in a most interesting conclusion !!! VERY WELL DONE !!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Nice clean interface. Very easy to use. Alarm starts out soft and slowly increases in volume. Snooze 10 min.  Well worth it. Great for travel. Several ways to display.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Super CD but the Target Deluxe version has all 3 bonus studio tracks plus 3 live bonus tracks.  For $14.99 you will be buying his best CD in decades.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Very easy to use.  Sometimes it will tell you a cleaning is required. I like that. No ads either.<br />I have it on all my devices.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is compelling. You think you are reading basically a fantasy adventure story, with a realistic bent. At the end, you get more of a philosophical twist. This was a quick read, I used whispersync to listen and read the book on Kindle. I ended up reading 2/3 of it because I did not want to put it down.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This book was simply amazing! I can't wait until the movie comes out! This is so sad. It makes you think about what you do to others.
0345525558|3.0|Too long but the information on flowers is worth the reading.  Good story, some good twists and turns,just too drawn out.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Lyrical, percussive, haunting.<br /><br />Many forget that industrial music originated as mechanical, dischordant dance music.  This album will remind you of those origins.<br /><br />This might be a quieter album than might have been expected.  There are blues influences; maybe some Peter Gabriel and Depeche Mode in there, too.<br /><br />I am sure the light show when I get to see them in October will be exquisite.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|A very fun, light, uplifting period piece. Nice to watch good programming that doesn't have all the sex and violence of today's programming. Too bad it ended after only three seasons.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I loved this movie as well as did when I first watch it years ago. I hope they come out with a third movie.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|REALLY SHOW HER SINING ABILITY.  YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE VIDEO ALSO.  BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES, IT MAKES YOU WANT TO DANCE!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I was surprised. The game is really pretty. It looks great on my kindle fire. But I really like it because it follows a story line. And you can play light side or dark side.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this app.  7 year old grandson and I had fun together figuring out each level.  Can't wait for more levels.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I've been a fan of Dream Theater since I walked into Tower Records back in the day - and listened to like 30 seconds of every song on Awake.  So - I went DT crazy - bought Images and Words - and their very first - When Dream and Day Unite.  Then of course A Change of Seasons - awesome!<br /><br />I wasn't much of a fan for Falling Into Infinity - but fell in love with every note and the story of Scenes from a Memory.<br /><br />Then came Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  I took my woman to that show in LA - and she was hooked!<br /><br />Train of Thought was awesome - metal for metal's sake!<br /><br />Octavarium was an awesome ride!<br /><br />Now - Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds and Silver Linings - I just felt like they were writing songs that were too monumental - and were losing themselves to writing long dramatic pieces - and the short tight nit killer tunes that caught the listener by surprise were lacking.<br /><br />A Dramatic Turn of Events came out - and wow!  Talk about a title of an album true to what was happening in their life musically.  You could feel the excitement coming off of that album.<br /><br />Now - I'm listening to the self-titled Dream Theater and I'm at Surrender to Reason.  Just downloaded thru Amazon - and I've been transported back to Images and Words and Awake.  The songs are much tighter and are mind blowing!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I dig Portnoy - but I think his leaving the band was what they needed to get back to their roots!<br /><br />So far - this album rules!<br /><br />Can't wait for the live Blu-Ray later in November - so I can see that crazy Mangini do his drum solo again.  Saw them here in San Diego - and that man is a machine when it comes to the drums.  The drum solo he pulled off was insane!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|easy to read, fun to read, active tense passage and super apprehendable. especially if you are one of those people at a crosspoint in life or is stuck in the downslope in life, this book is your best guideline.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I picked this up at an airport on a long trip to help save battery life on my electronic devices. Despite being dead tired, I found the book completely engaging and when I got home, I forced myself to savor it and not finish it too quickly. Then I bought the Kindle version so I could carry it around with me.<br /><br />The novel was translated from Spanish, and it carries the lyricism of language and thought that's characteristic of so much good Spanish writing. (There's a little flavor of Gabriel Garcia Marquez.) It's not quite Magical Realism, but an air of the supernatural hovers over the plot. It was a great blend of family saga, mystery, narratives within narratives, the wonder and preciousness of books, determination of character, and beautiful insight into human nature. The plot is complex, the characters memorable and Zafon writes gorgeously.<br /><br />I don't know that I would rank it among the classics, because I don't think it's that kind of book. It's more along the level of Robert Harris, perhaps, or Stieg Larsson...only cast along the line of Spanish romanticism. It's a page-turner illustrating the complexities of human relationships and emotions during a sparer, bygone era.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|this Star Trek was full of action and was just plain good if you are a trekkie or not. Awesome!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love it. It was a great Price and it is great to watch u tube on my tv. Very easy to set up. You can watch Netflix too.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|Purchased this when it first came out, but lost my copy somewhere (probably loaned it to someone who didn't return it).  Saw &#34;Step Up Revolution&#34; on a movie channel a while ago and remembered how much I enjoyed the first one (the 2 sequels do not measure up to Channing Tatum and Jenna DeWan), so I purchased another.  Love watching it and the dancing, although somewhat out of my era, is amazing.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun ad relaxing game. enjoy playing everday!!  I have several friends that  have start playing thi game as much as me..
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Please add more levels I've been waiting and looking ever since world 13 came out... love the game!!! I hope you buy it
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Chances are if you are reading this review, you have read far, and I'm sure I won't tell you anything that you haven't figured out by now, but here is my two-cents worth:<br /><br />I just received these phones today (9/24/2013) and I have been using them for about 6 hours as of the time of this review. I am very impressed with these Sony's. The sound reproduction is excellent, and there is no distortion at high volumes. The lows are there as they were intended, and the mids and highs are crystal clear. It is also worth noting that they are fairly comfortable. They warm my ears a little bit, but nothing bad. Otherwise once you have them adjusted, you can hardly tell that they are on.<br /><br />I consider myself a bit of an audiophile, and I enjoy good sounding music. These 7506's are the first that I looked at, followed by the V6's. These isn't much of a difference for the \\"average\\" listener, but the V6's do offer more on the low end and are a little more \\"warm\\" in that regard. The 7506's are sharper. Overall, I prefer the 7506 more, and they are really just a newer version of the V6. At the time I purchased these, the 7506 was about $15-$20 cheaper, so based on what I heard testing, I went with these. If you are debating the 7506 vs. the V6, I would go with whatever is cheaper at the time. For under $100, these are arguably the BEST you can buy.<br /><br />If you are wondering about all of the \\"break-in\\" stuff, I personally don't believe in it, but everyone has their own opinion. To \\"break-in\\" any headphone, I just use them how I normally intend to use them. Overtime, you can pick out minor differences with listening time, but that is just your ears getting used to the sound. Break-in or not is up to you, again I don't believe in 100 or more hours of breaking-in with special tracks, just use them how you will use them.<br /><br />I use these on my computer, Sony CD burner, iPod classic, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, as well as my old LXI series stereo from Sears with a separate amp and EQ. The best sound comes from either the CD burner or the stereo, but those have more power output compared to a computer or iPod. However, these headphones also work well when powered by a computer or iPod. However, if you are using these with MP3's or others of the like, you MUST make sure that you have a good quality file. 128kbps is the MINIMUM! If you have the room, go for 320kbps MP3 or a \\"lossless\\" file. These phones will ruin a poor quality file. The best way is to either rip a CD in 320 or lossless or buy high-quality MP3. I don't encourage illegally downloading music, but if you do, that's your choice. Just make sure it is a good, large file or you will regret it.<br /><br />Well, I think that should finish my review. I hope you found it helpful and if there are any other questions I haven't answered, ask me.eparate amp and EQ.

B00F8L2VO4|4.0|the app looks super effective and I love how it teaches but is there ever going to be any other languages like Japanese??
B0085TKAW6|4.0|A great story continuing the lives of those in the first novel facing the problems and dangers of World War 2. Having lived through this period, the events described in the book  were real to me and brought back many memories both pleasant and sad of those years  and I again felt the impact on my family which lost a son and brother in the war in the Pacific.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It is like being transported back in time, except the graphics are much better. Good job. Funny thing, just watched Wargames last night.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Almost perfect. The iPad does work as a remote control, but is not as easy to start and stop playing a video as Chrome makes it sound. But it all does work.
B00138CYD4|5.0|This is an enjoyable album and just flowed very well. I really like it. You can't go wrong with Santana!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Very interesting storyline and good special effects.  This is a very entertaining movie and one I would consider buying for my collection, as I would probably want to watch it again.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I enjoy reading things that stretch my imagination but this missed the mark in my opinion. It just didn't work for me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is talented. I've read 3 of his books and love them all. He tells entertaining stories while making you think about serious realities. His books are quick reads but are good for any age.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Never a dull moment with very good special effects.  Definitely worth watching if you're after action.<br />The 3 is because I'm not a Thor fan.  Also, Natalie Portman's part was a bit goofy in this movie.<br />Anthony Hopkins was fantastic, as always.
B009GED1IY|5.0|I saw the play first, and loved it.  So I was a little apprehensive about the movie.  I was wrong.  This movie is so much fun.  It is full of cheesy goodness.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|Provides a wholistic view of the war including events leading to it. Maybe examples of heroism by individual soldiers/officers would have added some charm. Overall balanced and gives a sense of perspective.
B001MM28JG|5.0|This movie is so much fun.  As a lifelong Star Trek fan, I love the way it makes fun of the recognized patterns from the show (ensign expendable, killer monsters, tag lines).
B003NS2T9G|4.0|I have enjoyed this production.  Lots of fun and the writing is exceptional.  I enjoyed the character development and it is refreshing to see a successful professional life and a successful personal life even it borders on the fantastical.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The best book I have read in a long time I loved every single minute of it. John Greene is extremely talented.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it several time since.  It is quirky, funny, and has a lot of great stars in it.  This is a must have in my movie library.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a very interesting book with parallel stories that all come together at different time periods as well as the book conclusion..  The writer was creative in doing so. While simplistic at times, the plot was very engaging and produced lots of fodder for discussion about relationships.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is I found the conclusion a little on the dark side...
1780721676|5.0|The book is exactly as I expected it to be.  Although it was pre-owned, it was in like-new condition.  Thank you.
B00E9ZAT4Y|5.0|Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Mary Poppins on Blue Ray.  Had been waiting soooooooo long for this!! I am pre-ordering right now.  Thank you Disney, for FINALLY releasing this. I guess they are waiting for 50th Anniversary.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This is a Great movie. Classic horror is the best. Movie arrived on time. I'm glad the disk didn't come cracked
B00EQNYOYU|4.0|&#34;Hesitation Marks&#34; is an album that feels every bit like a NIN album. Trent Reznor doesn't reach for the lofty, ambitious heights of previous albums like The Downward Spiral and The Fragile, but he doesn't offer up cookie-cutter, formulaic industrial tunes either. On each song, you can feel the unique songwriting style, the often infectious melodies, and the excellent production that Reznor has become known for, and you'll find at least a couple of songs that you'll be humming to yourself later.<br /><br />The overall sound feels like a cross between the debut NIN album &#34;Pretty Hate Machine&#34; and the veteran album &#34;With Teeth&#34;. Each song definitely has a mechanical flavor to it, notably in the percussive background and synthesized instruments. In the past twenty-five or so years, however, Reznor has become an expert at layering voices and sounds to create a powerful effect, or a contemplative quietness, or really whatever he wants to convey.<br /><br />In some ways this album sounds less forceful than others, a bit more restrained, and that may not be everyone's cup of tea. Reznor is a bit less aggressive and a bit more melodic in Hesitation Marks than he has been in the past, perhaps drawing influence from his own work with his new band How To Destroy Angels. This album, however, has the same excellent songwriting as any other album he's made in the past ten years, and the familiar and undeniable NIN style. Hesitation Marks acts as an excellent reintroduction to Nine Inch Nails, and hopefully a sign of more great music to come.
B003E2UQMS|4.0|I enjoyed, the characters were brilliantly depicted.  I saw the movie and felt the characterization was lost completely in the film.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like this app much better than other g5 apps because you don't have to pay to play. Although it can help you advance more quickly, it is not necessary. So far I haven't paid for anything and besides waiting for a while between game sessions, it's a fun game to play continually.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed both characters and the history which I was not aware of.  I did think that perhaps the stories had a little bit too much silver lining but then while not realistic, always appreciated.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is an awesome game I think u should by it :):):) please by awesome game for children it cool and so fun
B009C7JS14|5.0|i love the detail information i get plus it never crashes on me!  i also like how i can also have a clock on it so whenever i set it down, i can have my clock on
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|This app is a lot of fun, and it starts off as free. You can purchase power ups but the game is enjoyable enough without them. The cue is a little sensitive, but I think you can adjust that in the options. I would like to get a more personalized avatar, but don't know how???
B009HUB40Y|2.0|I love jewel and matching games. This is sort of the same with different special powered gems. But EXTREMELY annoying in repeating between every game board to rate, purchase more lives, sign in through Facebook or post to your status. Maybe with the rating done we can skip that part now!
B0042J6VUS|1.0|does not even fit nokia lumia 521 with a thin case. DO NOT BUY. It is a waste of money and will only collect dust in your home
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I love stories that take place in other countries, esp when the author does a good job of capturing regional accents in how she writes quotes. it really gives the characters a voice.  There is an unexpected turn, which is always welcome.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Practical ideas with just the right amount of inspiration. This is a wonderful (and quick) read for any artist who needs a swift kick in the pants to get moving, or a pat on the shoulder and a kind word to &#34;keep up the good work.&#34;
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Just wish there were more than  three seasons. The characters and setting were just so much fun to get to know and enjoy.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|I saw this in theater, now I own it because I love zombie films, especially block buster films. They did a great job on CGI, and special effects. The acting was good, some of the writing was subpar but overall good entertainment. OH,  it not at all true to the book.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I can't believe this movie is as old as it is... I remember when it first came out. I have so many fond childhood memories associated with this film. Even now that I'm older and better able to understand the story, it remains just as sweet and lovely as when it first came out. Ever After is the only Cinderella story I truly love and identify with. It meshes all the traditional aspects of the classic fairy-tale with history, realism, and whimsy.<br /><br />Some of my favorite aspects (but not limited to): Leonardo da Vinci as fairy godmother, Marguerite's legs flying up over her head, the portrayal of Prince Henry as a floundering young man who is inspired by the woman he loves, gentle humor, and the wicked stepmother/ step sister getting their comeuppance.<br /><br />Watch it and enjoy it! :)
B00D2K40WY|3.0|I bought the full version and then everything had gotten deleted! And when I tried to get it again ,because it had said I wouldn't have to pay, it made me pay twice as much!
0385292244|5.0|An epic historical, but not history, tale of 17th Century Japan. Clavell immerses you in the world Blackthorne finds himself marooned in so that you sense his isolation. As always, the author's use of the native language, cadences & slang add authenticty and spice to the dialogue,
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I love the Iron Man movies and this one great for me.  I did watch some of the extra content and I did like that as well...
B005CX53RU|5.0|Works great.  Cannot beat a Bluetooth device with replaceable batteries.  The two \\"ends\\" shown are for the curve of the different headphones that this is compatible with.  Both ends are included, and easy to install.  This can charge outside of the headphones.<br /><br />Update: I have moved this same battery from an MM 450-X to a new MM 550-X (changing the molding cap using the included spares), and it is still in rotation.  I'd say it's still 80% as effective as when it was new.  VERY happy with this.

1594202273|3.0|This book is about U.S. efforts to ensure that nuclear weapons aren't detonated by accident or any other unauthorized means. Most of the events depicted took place a long time ago. Thousands of nuclear warheads still sit atop U.S. and Russian missiles, with hundreds more in India, China, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea, Great Britain, and France.<br /><br />Schlosser's book begins with the story of how a dropped wrench pierced a fuel tank in an underground Titan II missile armed with a 9 megaton weapon and located near Damascus, Ark. where it was being repaired 9/18/80. This story continues ad nauseam spread over several hundred pages with an agonizing level of detail until the propellant explodes, ejecting the warhead and into a ditch 200 yards away. Other incidents are similarly detailed.<br /><br />The 'good news' is that there have been no accidental or unauthorized nuclear explosions, we and the Russians now have fewer missiles than before, and undoubtedly safety precautions have improved considerably. Better yet, American missiles are no longer preprogrammed to hit their targets - thus, if fired off accidentally, its default system would send it into the ocean (hopefully). The 'bad news' is that the Damascus incident wasn't the worst - only one person was killed there, previously an accidental fire in another Arkansas silo killed 53 working on upgrading the missile's blast resistance. Worse yet, between 1965 and 1961, 12 airborne nuclear warheads were accidentally lost or damaged. Worst of all, nobody knows how vulnerable today's missiles are to cyber warfare.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, I like all the scene changes that came with the upgrade. Minions are really funny not to mention cute.
B0000AUHPK|1.0|I had pretty high expectations when I started watching this version of the famous story,especially given the impressive cast.<br />I'm afraid I could not take to Juliette Binoche (otherwise a great actress) and her rendition of a poor English/French accent.<br />I just can't cope with a French Cathy. Couldn't they find an English one? BOOOOOOO!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fab game very additive I would and have recommended to friends to play give it a try you won't put it down
B005HJWWW8|4.0|took a 40 hr training course (over 4 months) and the presentation volume was really low.  all other application volumes where fine.  i even when turn up it all the way, but was not loud enough to focus.  tried ear buds and headphones.  so i go this and it worked out great. I still ued the headphones, but did the job.  rechargable and volume control.  a little more expensive than i would have liked.
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|This album is for lovers of smooth sounds and artistic lyrics. This was recommended to me from previous purchased music and I was pleasantly surprised when I previewed it. I bought it as soon as possible. The sound is very different from anyone out there. Guys, If you are hanging out with a significant other, this is the record that you want to play... Trust me.

B000001E7V|5.0|Oh, how I wish Tricky had stayed right here.  This album creates a great mood.  Also, Allison Goldfrapp is featured on Pumpkin.  Her haunting vocals alone are worth the price of the entire work.

0765325950|5.0|So, the final book. Book 14! Some of the books from the series were a little slow (in my opinion). This one, as was to be expected, has action from page 1. Relevant action. No fillers. Everything is important to the end of the battle. Just as Thom Merrilin is looking for the right words to describe the battle, so am I. The only word that comes to mind is EPIC. Cried like a baby in some parts, couldn't help it. More than happy with the way it ends. Won't give it away...  So, if you're a Wheel of Time fan and you still have not purchased the book, what are you waiting for???  - I don't usually write reviews; this time, I had to.
B00F91H15W|1.0|Supposedly based on a true story, but there couldn't possibly be people this shallow and stupid in the world. I also can't believe celebrities don't have massive security at their homes when they are gone. The same thing happens over and over, so it was a relief when they finally got caught and the end was in sight. Pretty useless movie.
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Cher has been around so long that she has managed to record just about every genre of music out there. On \\"Closer To The Truth\\", her 26th album, she does two of the styles she has had the most success with, techno/dance and big power ballads. I am not a fan of the dance material, didn't like her previous album at all, and never liked \\"Believe\\" the song or the album. I much prefer her 70's-80's material. So if you're a fan of the dance \\"Believe\\" like material you will probably find much to like here, if you like her ballads, there are a few songs that stand out. Having said all of that, I don't care for the first three songs at all. They are all dance songs and basically just fluff. \\"My Love\\" (track 3) isn't really a dance track, but it wouldn't have sounded out of place on Madonna's \\"Ray Of Light\\" album. \\"Dressed To Kill\\" (the name of her upcoming tour) isn't a bad song, but her vocals on the verses have been so electronically altered that she sounds robotic. For me the album gets good starting with \\"I Walk Alone\\", this is still somewhat a danceable, but still sort of in the pop/rock area that she does so well. I really like \\"Sirens\\" and \\"Favorite Scars\\". The big ballad though is \\"I Hope You Find It\\" which is actually a cover of a song Miley Cyrus recorded first, Cher does it as only she can. \\"Lie To Me\\" is the other big ballad which is almost a country song.<br /> If you get the deluxe edition you get three bonus tracks, \\"I Don't Have To Sleep To Dream\\", \\"Pride\\" and from \\"Burlesque\\", \\"You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me\\". For me the album is a mixed bag, the ballads are great, the dance tracks are just thumping rhythms with forgettable lyrics. Finally the album cover, Cher has long said she always wanted to be a blonde like her mom and sister. On her last album she donned a blonde wig as well. So once again she is blonde on this cover, this time in a classic Playboy pose. It's ironic that the title of this album is \\"Closer To The Truth\\" when the album photos couldn't be further from the truth.<br /><br /> UPDATE: I've upped my stars by one. The bonus tracks on the Target edition make this album that much better. Particularly \\"Will You Wait For Me\\". I will say that since my original review, first impression, this album has grown on me. Still not crazy over the first two tracks, but after that it's a pretty decent album.
140006922X|4.0|An insightful look into this author's conceptualization of Jesus the man - through good research and application of cultural differences -  set appropriately in his times. I'm an avid student of theology, and this fits right into my genre. Jesus was arguably (?) the most influential person in our history. The bible doesn't adequately portray his amazing life, and the attributations made to him post-facto / post mortem do more to undermine him than support him. A very worthwhile read, IMO.

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|With headphones secure I sat down to listen to the new Dream Theater album.  In 1992 DT changed my musical landscape forever when I heard Images & Words.  For over 20 years now I've followed this great band on their truly progressive journey.  Reaching highs with 1999's SFOAM to, IMHO, lows of 2009's BL&SL (I should note a low for these guys is what mere mortals consider stellar) to the floor dropping out with founding drummer MP's departure a year later.  Two years ago the band I loved bounced back from what could have been a career ending injury with the, gets better every time I listen to it, ADTOE.  Illusions broken.<br /><br />Now, 24 years since WDADU came out, I clicked play on 2013's Dream Theater.  This album feels like the band hit the reset button.  Don't get me wrong, all of the things I love about DT are here.  The crunchy and soaring guitar of John Petrucci, the unstoppable grove of John Myung, the cinematic and morphing wizardry of Jordan Rudess and his many keyboard and iPad apps, the almost robotic and precise drumming of \\"the new guy\\" Mike Mangini and on top of that the soulful and elegant vocals of James Labrie.  Sometimes his voice can turn people off, similar to Geddy Lee in irritation of Rush, but James delivers on this disc.<br /><br />I say reset as this is not a continuation of the last album.  No, this sounds like the guys all sat in the studio together, talked about what they each wanted from this effort and worked to achieve it.  Gone are some of the long interludes on previous outings.  I love it when DT jam for 5 or 10 minutes showcasing the talents of these amazing musicians but this album seems more refined in that area.  DT is sometimes criticized for over the top bombast vs. thought out songwriting.  I would say they have the perfect balance here.<br /><br />I won't break down each song here, many others will take care of that.  What I will do is say the band I discovered so long ago is alive and well in the 21st century.  A seemingly renewed sense of purpose.  I write this on the day the album came out and after just one listen, I can say this is my album of the year.  I look forward to many more listens and looking forward to enjoying this delicious piece of chocolate cake.ly renewed sense of purpose.

B009K6DKTS|5.0|A very interesting read from Taleb building on his previous two books Fololed by Randomness and The Black Swan. Clearly challenges you to think differently and not to take research in various fields too seriously
B0053TMP24|4.0|It was a great book and a I had a great time reading it. I fouls the only negative thing was that the mythology seemed off.
B00F1BFRA6|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 4 is very good. I came across this quite by accident. I can't say enough about it. The stories are good and the acting is good. I found that the production values really add a lot too. I love it!<br /><br />One thing I like is the eye for detail. They try to get everything right for the period and the year this drama takes place. They obviously do a lot of research on the production and art design.

B00915G6MG|5.0|MH, what else is there to say?  NCIS is the best television show on TV.  A proven winner who just keeps on winning.  The characters are deliciously interwoven, the plots are varied; but the action is always there, without the bloody gory details some shows find necessary to display.<br />Absolutely my favorite, and Amazon keeps me current with all seasons.

B00B83ROPC|5.0|Blade Runner is one of my favourite films of all time. I re-watch every few months and it's a great watch every time I see it. I love everything about it. The story is interesting and the cast fill their roles superbly. Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer in particular stand out. The only downbeat for me on this front was Leon, but that wasn't a big deal.<br /><br />The world itself looks great on blu-ray and is still a visual treat. The future world feels authentic and the details pull you in, the opening shot of the city is simply wonderful. All through the film there are little details that add style and interest. It also blends high tech future, with grim reality that is still full of life.<br /><br />The film's soundtrack is amazing, it suits the film perfectly, it's worth picking up for that alone.<br /><br />I think it's safe to say that I love this film and if you haven't seen it yet then you owe it to yourself to do so.

0385743564|3.0|I consider Brandon Sanderson one of my very favorite authors. Anything he writes automatically goes on my wishlist, and I've enjoyed every book of his I've read. With Steelheart, however, there was a time where I wasn't even sure if I would be able to rate this book three stars at the end. This book doesn't live up to the other Sanderson novels I've read, the first in three other series (The Stormlight Archive, Alcatraz, and Mistborn). Of course, I'm sure different sorts of readers may like this one better, but I'm left rather disappointed, probably due to my exceedingly high expectations.<br /><br />As ever, where Brandon Sanderson shines is in the world building. Sanderson has a real knack for creating unique worlds that run on different principles, following that logic through. This world, while not as disparate as his epic fantasies, compels the imagination. Superhero stories have always held a fascination for me, and, with the Epics, Sanderson has done something wholly new, to my experience anyway, with that concept. The Epics are villains, every last one of them, proving the old adage that absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br /><br />That premise may suggest to you, and rightly so, that Steelheart gets rather dark. This is not a world of brave, unparalleled heroism, of good triumphing over evil. Even the good guys have dark secrets and motivations. Take, for example, the main character, David. He's a fairly average teen, except for that whole thing where he's dedicated his life to avenging his father, with the single-minded devotion of Inigo Montoya.<br /><br />Steelheart, the titular villain, rules over a Newcago, a Chicago made of steel where the sun literally doesn't shine. Steelheart and his cronies, including Nightwielder who blocks the sun from the city, keep systems going and food available to the people, in exchange for utter domination. Epics, these super-powered individuals, can do anything to any person without recrimination; the government of the US limps along in some areas of the Fractured States, but the Epics truly have free reign. It's a horrific picture, rather like humanity has begun involving and Magneto's crew have subjugated everyone, and there are no X-Men.<br /><br />Sanderson also proves himself a skilled plotter once again. In every novel, Sanderson always manages to surprise me with something, if not with an actual twist then with exactly how something worked, even if I had it generally figured out. That always makes his books that extra bit of exciting to read.<br /><br />However, the character-building in Steelheart really left me wanting so much more. In his other novels, I've found his characters almost immediately compelling, not just the main characters, but the supporting ones as well. With Steelheart, I didn't much care for a single character. The Reckoners, a team of humans killing Epics to prove it can be done and that fighting back is possible, should be a quirky bunch with all the personality of the crew of the Firefly. Sadly, though they're quirky, none of them really coalesced into feeling real and their witty banter was seriously lacking.<br /><br />Many of the problems lie in the narrator, David. He alternates between an encyclopedic knowledge of weaponry and Epics and mindless devotion to his cause of killing Steelheart and drooling over Megan. He instaloves all over the place on this girl because she's super hot and can fight. Wow, what a solid foundation for a relationship. As far as I can tell, Sanderson's pushing this ship, but he's got a lot of work to do to make that happen, because they have no chemistry: David's a kid with pathetic puppy love and Megan's...I don't really know.<br /><br />Anyway, David. Not only do I not found David to be a particularly interesting character, his narration is frequently annoying. Idiosyncracies help build realistic characters, but, in this case, I feel like David was given one idiosyncracy and sent on his way like the work was done. That idiosyncracy: making really ridiculous metaphors constantly, like:<br /><br />\\"He had a smile like a parrotfish, which I've always assumed look like parrots, though I've never actually seen either.\\"<br /><br />What incredibly useful narration there, David! You have just managed to tell the reader nothing on several levels. Congratulations! There are many such instances, and it's made into a running gag throughout the book, but it's one that failed to make me laugh; the only response it provoked from me was eye-rolling. I can imagine this working from a character who isn't otherwise so deadly serious, but it didn't fit the rest of David's characterization.<br /><br />Then there's the Southern Scot, who embodies every stereotype of American Southerners and the Scottish, down to a monologue on the bagpipes that is TOTALLY plot-relevant (SARCASM). This guy, Cody, threw me out of the book every time he referred to individuals as \\"y'all\\" and groups as \\"all y'all.\\" I've been informed that some southerners do use \\"y'all\\" this way, but it makes my eye twitch because \\"y'all\\" is an abbreviation of \\"YOU ALL.\\" IT IS PLURAL. Also, why is this necessary? As with David's quirk, I feel like the weaknesses of the characterization are largely shortcuts taken to add humor to the novel and make them seem more real and quirky. Sadly, this backfired big time.<br /><br />Though this is thus far my least favorite of Sanderson's works, he can still world build like few other authors. The Reckoners series will be a good choice for fans of supervillains and world building. More character-focused readers, like myself, may struggle with this one.at idiosyncracy: making really ridiculous metaphors constantly, like:<br /><br />\\"He had a smile like a parrotfish, which I've always assumed look like parrots, though I've never actually seen either.\\"<br /><br />What incredibly useful narration there, David!

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Love the fact that this movie &#34;continues&#34; the characterizations of the original Star Trek crew.  Great writing.  Great performances. Great idea.  Star Trek 2009 brings much of the original Star Trek to &#34;a whole new world&#34; audience.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game. got it on all of my devices. would love even more if you had some of the same updates for the kindle that you did for the android phones. like the speed play, and other such things. prefer it on the larger screen. thanks, and please keep going.  can't wait to see the next disease come out

B0025KW29U|5.0|If you are a Neil Patrick Harris fan (and really, who isn't?), then you MUST own this! It's a quirky, sarcastic, hilarious musical... and it's the brain child of all 3 Whedon brothers. What more could you ask for?!
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|This is such a beautiful collection of songs...each just show casing Celine's incredible talent. Her voice goes from being so beautifully soft and warm to certain portions where you obviously know the power of Celine's voice ( without waking up baby!) starting with the amazing title track, just about every other song brings tears to your eyes.<br /><br />My lil' one always falls asleep as I received the mp3 version to play on my phone via Amazon cloud along with the purchase of the CD ( which I've kept in the car).<br /><br />The only negative I can say- the music is so soothing that it will make parents want to leave the piles of chores and nap along with baby to this beautiful album.

B00C061HZY|5.0|This album is not the Daft Punk we know and love. Oh...sadly it is not. However, this is the album of a experienced and more refined Daft Punk, who has learned how to cater to its audiences needs. While there are a couple tracks on the album that I felt were &#34;iffy&#34; and on first play didn't care for much such as &#34;Touch&#34;, &#34;Motherboard&#34;, and &#34;Contact&#34; I bought the LP and as a result I am forced to listen to the tracks during the records play through. With that being said... with each play through they have begun to grow on me more and more and the album as a whole has really begun to round itself out.<br /><br />The top tracks in my opinion are &#34;Give Life Back to Music&#34;, &#34;Lose Yourself to Dance&#34;, &#34;Get Lucky&#34;, and &#34;Fragments of Time&#34;.<br /><br />If you buy this album with the intent of listening to something similar to what Daft Punk released during their &#34;Discovery&#34; and &#34;Homework&#34; years you will sorely be disappointed. There is no comparison you can make with this album and their earlier work. If you must have a basis of comparison for this album think of 70s disco mixed with a modern techno synthesized flair. That's the best way I can describe it and I'm loving it even more each time I play it through.<br /><br />Now on to the album itself. It came to me in perfect shape and is a piece of art in itself with a couple of goodies stashed in the sleeve. The records themselves looked extremely clean when I opened the album but I cleaned them with RCA D+ just in case there was some mold release compounds still on the record's surface. The sound was excellent as would be expected for a LP record. Now I just gotta keep the record as clean as possible to try to avoid the inevitable pops that come with age. The MP3 copy of the record was downloaded onto my ITunes without trouble.
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|A good basic game, but the lack of clear level progression makes it hard to get a real sense of progress. I like the idea, but I don't feel very accomplished for playing.

1250030951|5.0|Calling all Muggles, Mundanes, Twilighters, Trekkies, Jedis, Hobbits, and... [insert your fandom here]: Rainbow Rowell has written a book with YOUR name on it... and it is called FANGIRL. (Or you can mentally rename it FANBOY, if that feels more appropriate).<br /><br />Not really being one who has ever fallen so far into a fandom beyond attending midnight launch parties for the final three Harry Potter novels (sans costume, the final book while pregnant), even I found myself connecting with the main character, Cath, and her love for all things Simon Snow. Although I have never been one to write fan fiction, I have loved something enough to draw fan art on the occasion. Perhaps those are (arguably) almost the same thing? Regardless, I've never seriously obsessed over a franchise... If you have been there and you have done that when it comes to extreme fandom and fan fiction, FANGIRL may very well be your gospel.<br /><br />Beyond the basic premise, as well as the incredibly creative Simon Snow \\"fan fiction\\" excerpts staggered throughout the novel, FANGIRL also involves a much deeper story. FANGIRL is as much about family, friends, growing up and discovering oneself as it is about the wonderful world of fanaticism. It's also about building trust, trust in yourself and trust in others. Cath has been burned in her life; she has a mother who left her and a father who may or may not be falling apart mentally. Many kids experience some sort of \\"life crisis\\" when it comes time to leave for college. Cath's life crisis has arrived at full force, and she's not quite sure if she's ready to face it.<br /><br />A bit of an anti-social internet sensation, Cath is an online fan fiction writer who has never really done anything for herself. Well, sure her love for Simon Snow and every action she takes as a fan of the series is kind of like \\"doing something for herself\\" - since being a fan is what she wants to do... But she's always had her sister by her side when it comes to school, and at home she's only ever thought of her father. Remove the father figure and remove the sister, and what does Cath have left? What do any of us actually \\"have\\" when we first venture out into the world and must give some thought to our futures? The exploration of many \\"life altering\\" questions are handled brilliantly in Rainbow's FANGIRL.<br /><br />There's a bit of romance involving a young college boy who will make you want to simultaneously pinch as well as slap his cheeks. Here, too, is a kid who needs to figure out his priorities in life. I found the growth of the character, Levi, to be just as engrossing as that of the growth of Cath (or as he calls her, \\"Cather\\"). Ugh, but if he didn't make one or two mistakes that seriously made me want to wring his neck... Thank goodness he redeemed himself and was just plain adorable.<br /><br />Although it gets a bit choppy at times when it comes to the progression of time over the duration of the school year and, subsequently, the novel, FANGIRL will hook the reader from the very beginning and not let go until the end. You will cheer for Cath, want to hold her hand at times, fall in love with her writing (which has an ironic twist to it in the end) and become proud of her as she grows. It's worth mentioning that FANGIRL has a very polished and wrapped up ending. If you like that sort of thing, this may be an added bonus for you after Eleanor & Park.<br /><br />FANGIRL is sure to please current fans of her books, as well as draw in potential new readers.<br /><br />A must-read of 2013., and at home she's only ever thought of her father.

B00C7DGQ9C|5.0|This movie was so action packed and the cast was absolutely perfect. I was hanging on the edge of my seat the whole time
B0017JG2PA|5.0|WOW!!! As soon as I put this record on I was hooked. This album is amazing. This has got to be in the top 5 best blues albums of all time. Texas Flood is probably the best song on here. Great stuff, A must for any collection.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I heard one of their songs on YouTube so I decided to buy the CD and I love it....Radioactive rules
0385340990|5.0|Wonderfully written book of letters from fictitious characters to the main character in the book that made up the story.  All based on researched authentic history of that time when the Germans invaded Guernsey Island.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of book from the era of WWII and the struggle it was for the islanders to survive along with the German soldiers.  A real look into the mood and tone and emotions of that time in world history!  The story line was and plot was easy to follow and a delight!  This was a book selected for our Book Club to read one month recently and bring our reviews back to the next meeting! Sheri DeLoach
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|I ordered this movie on my Kindle and I absolutely love this movie. 2 thumbs up! I highly recommend this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is looking at life that I would not have known. I am glad that this show also restorations of the castle and bring tourist dollars to the area.
B00ECLU346|3.0|Did not like it at all, some funny moments but spread out. I'll probably watch it again so I feel like I got my money worth.
0375869026|5.0|I work as a school administrator and this book was exceptionally enlightening.  I loved the realistic conversations and the student point of view.  Loved the recognition of how important a person's soul is vs. their physical characteristics.  Beautiful book for a variety of ages..
0061900656|4.0|It's good for a basics big brother book. It talks about the things babies can and cannot do, how big brothers can help, etc. It's fun to read now and again but my 3 y/o doesn't pick it off the shelf like others.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|This is most imaginative in plot, casting and dialogue!  Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman are not jut good they are great, as is the entire cast of this wonderful production.  This is a film to view again and again.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Re-reading it now for the 4th time.  Thank you Max Brooks for such a well written novel that is nothing like the movie...
B00AEBB8H4|5.0|The excitement, the drama, the lighting and cinematography and just brilliant.  The total production values are of a kind that one rarely encounters now days.  There is a plot!  There is clever dialogue!  There is beauty!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Even though I have already published my books, this Kindle book was still useful because I gained new insights. Read.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|I know every type in this film.  The accompanist, the crazed Director, The wounded Tenor,  The Soprano who can't stop talking about her curtain calls.  The Mezzo who is losing her wits.  I know them all and love them.  This is a must have in your collection of films.
B00138GZAC|5.0|I have always enjoyed Sade's cool, smooth, jazzy style. Very relaxing music.....I play it while I'm on the computer and the time flies by. I recommend this highly !
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I so loved this book with its dry humour and wit, that I found it hard to put down.  But luckily, I took it on holiday with me so was mostly able to read without interruption.  The characters were so well drawn,  with the protagonist so unaware of his wonderful qualities.
B005544V6A|5.0|I like the characters and story lines.  actors are all very attractive, specially the females.  Luis Litt is the most interesting of the bunch.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|It is a really good game except for the fact that every time I try and quit one game the whole game crashes.
B0073COMUW|5.0|And very low/no heat. I installed three of these in my enclosed kitchen fixture. Much brighter than I anticipated. We love the bright withe light. It does take a little getting used to as common bulbs have a slight yellow tint to them. These are great and I will buy more.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|I am going to be honest, after his great effort into Take Care I was a little nervous about this album. I didn't know if he still had it in him to deliver another great album. Well Drake proved me wrong. The production on this album is just superb, every beat just hits you. Drake's lyrical performance is always on par with his stories about females, his background, and his long comings. Nothing Was The Same is an album where you can listen to from start to finish without skipping a track. Drake keeps revolutionizing as an Artist (Not Rapper). If you all still consider Drake a rapper you really need to reconsider. He is far from that. Drake is a true Artist.<br /><br />My Top 5<br /><br />1. Tuscan Leather<br />2. Own It<br />3. Pound Cake<br />4. Wu-Tang Forever<br />5. The Language<br /><br />Honorable Mention - 305 To My City
B00F3HPELK|5.0|I was waiting so long for an album to come that would include the hits on the EPs out there, like Killin'It, Alive, etc, so this was a must grab for me. If by any chance you haven't heard them, just give them a try, you will be instantly hooked!
B007XHWROK|1.0|I am going to sue Mr. Bieber after this atrocity. One play through this album and my Doctor subscribed me to anti depressants and had me on suicide watch. Next time I'll just put a cheese grater to my face instead of listening to this dookie.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Oh my goodness, so much emotion. Anger that children could be treated that way, elation at the surprise ending... please read this book. You won't regret it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a pretty good basic game that even plays well on my little generic android tablet. I keep having to redownload the appstore to play my amazon apps, but at least this one runs well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoy it :) can't wait to read the rest. I would recommend you reading this book. I hope you enjoy.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy setup and it just works, cant beat the price either 35 bucks is a good deal thinking about buying another one.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Sorry, but I don't really like reviews, but it was one of the better ones of the series for me.
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|If I am lucky, I can locate a video on You Tube. I would not recommend this for Kindle Fire.
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|Upon my initial listening to this album it was tough to gauge if this is a collection of songs which would stay with me over time. I look at Dream Theater as everything before 'Train of Thought' (An album that i love) and everything after 'Train of Thought'. From 'Octavarium' onward, the band's songs seem to have often been plagued by riffs that hang on too long, bad lyrics, and a lack of feeling. This capped itself off with what could easily be the bands worst album in 'Black Clouds' and the resulting departure of Mike Portnoy. To their credit however, each album had a couple of great tracks, and Systematic Chaos in particular was very strong throughout.    With this, the bands newest and self titled Album, i still long for the raw passionate riffs of old. There is nothing here that remotely resembles the deeply authentic sounds of any song from their masterpiece 'Awake' album, nor does it include any of the wild time signatures and tempo changes of 'Scenes from a Memory'. I still long for the muddy emotion of 'Misunderstood', or a story as real as 'Take away my pain' or 'Scarred'. One thing in particular that has bothered me in recent years with Dream Theater's lyrics is that they have descended into the vague, or at times simply a story without much impact. Their older works have a much sharper edge that way, and it always bled into the music. The reality is, if you were to hear the Awake demos from 1994 and hear the level of raw passion in '6:00' and 'Caught in a Web' from those tapes, or the live stuff from 1997, and then listen to this, it is simply several levels below.    Perhaps it is just the natural process which most bands fall to over the course of time. It is difficult to find the raw passion of the first time forever. If you take a look at old videos from the bands 'Images' or 'Work in Progress' tours, you see real stage energy. As the years wear on, their movements become less and less until eventually it is gone almost completely. So then, here is acollection of very good songs, but none of which really have the raw strength of what came before.    At this point it may seem that this is then a bad album, but that is not the case. This new offering from Dream Theater is without doubt, strong as anything they have put out in recent years. There is less tedium in the riffs than 'Constant Motion', as the chord progressions are generally bright and exciting. Another real high point is the bass work by Myung, which is arguably among the best of his career. Technically the music is sound. The guitar work is especially crisp with good differentiation between sound and silence. It never falls into that noodling trap of cramming too many notes into a small space. There is character to the solos, although they never really reach the melodic heights of 'Take the Time'. James in particular has been growing ever stronger on vocals in recent years. While he has still never, and may never again reach the pinnacle of his power as he did in 1997, the most recent 'Dramatic Turn of Events' tour saw him at his best since 2004, and probably a little bit stronger still. This renaissance in James' vocals shows in the album work. It is strong throughout.    To further expand upon this point in a new paragraph i am writing now a year after my original review, the trend of better live performance has continued throughout 2014. James is undeniably delivering some of the better performances of his career lately. I find that Mangini has a good skill for holding the drum tempo down slightly, giving Petrucci the time to crisply land his notes. Whatever the opinion on the 'better overall' drummer is not an argument i intend to make here. Simply it seems that Mangini does an excellent job of defining the down beat. The trickle down effect has empowered Petrucci, but it would not be unreasonable to think that it is also empowering James.     The album mix is generally strong, although perhaps a bit louder than i would prefer. I am personally of mind that a good sound system can make the music loud. Also, most users will add their own EQ to the mix, and so the master should peak below the threshold. Still, it is far from the muddled mess that turned one of Dream Theater's finest collections of songs (Falling into Infinity) into a product that sounded as though it was by far their worst. The final product represents them very well, and the song structure translates extremely well onto stage.    There is not a weak track on this album, although 'The Looking Glass' and 'Enigma Machine' are easily the best, both elevating to a slightly higher level than the rest. Thankfully the band has chosen to perform both on stage and they sound great. 'Illumination Theory' is one that never grabbed me on the album, but i have come to appreciate it more in show. It is still not decidedly the best of their 20 minute songs though. I wish that we could hear more of this album live, in particular 'Surrender to Reason'. Trying to find a proper review score for this album on the whole is difficult. The swath of 5 star ratings to come is expected and understandable. Then, on the other hand, I am certain that there is no song in this collection that is even as remotely as brilliant as 'Scarred', 'Learning to Live', 'Take away my pain', 'Ones who help to set the sun', the whole 'Six Degrees' album, or 'Fatal Tragedy' among so many others. There is simply nothing here that reaches that level of songwriting. The longer i let this album sit in my mind, which is now well over a year, the more it fades away from my memory. Their stage performance in the years 2013/2014 do not though. It is worth making that important distinction.    This collection is worth investing in, and as a singer, i crave an instrumental copy to sing on. It just leaves me wanting so much more. It is completely sound on a technical level, but is missing songs that evolve and morph into something greater, when the rawness of a story like 'Scarred' fuels the music.It would be near impossible to simply walk out the front door of your house in the morning and make that story happen, and perhaps in that way, Dream Theater is damned. As a long time fan however, i hope that this competent release is just another stepping stone in an upward trend. I also love how Mangini's particular talents have changed the band. This is a band that feels as though it is on the way up as opposed to down. It is simply that until the final barrier is breached beyond technical excellence to raw emotion, their new studio cuts will continue to fade from mind. Therefore, the final verdict is three stars out of five.
1616550414|5.0|I really love this book. I bought it for a friends birthday, and it is definitely worth the money. I had to open it because it looked like there was a huge scratch on the front cover, (it was just the plastic, thank goodness)so i got to read it a little bit before I gave it to him lol. For all the fans out there frustrated that a lot of things in the game series have been confusing, this is the perfect book! It explains the timelines and explains a lot. There is also concept art for most of the games and also a comic at the end to kind of add more explanation to the beginning of skyward sword if i'm correct. This is a very large book, in both size and content.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like it!  As others have said, it's easy to use and gives you the info that matter most without having to flip through a bunch of menus.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very exciting game one of the best puzzle games out today that causes you to think.  Not difficult at all it just forces you to think outside the box or quit...hahaha
B001UEBHYS|4.0|Slumdog Millionaire is a fantastic movie! It is about a young man, Jamal, who goes on the hit show in India, \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\\", in hopes that his long, lost love, Latika, is watching. Jamal is an uneducated boy from the slums so the country is shocked when he makes it all the way to the final question. Then, the show runs out of time and on his way out Jamal is taken and interrogated by authorities. They are convinced that he has to be cheating and demand answers. Jamal begins to explain how he knew all the answers and tells about how each question is a unique memory to him. His older brother, Salim, and him considered themselves the \\"two musketeers\\" when they were younger, and were rather mischievous. After witnessing their mother being killed in an anti-Muslim raid, they escape the city, Mumbai, meeting Latika, a young girl orphaned in the raid also. Salim is resistant on letting her hang around, but Jamal insists that she become part of their group. The threesome runs into a local gangster who provides poor children with food and shelter but exploits them by making them beg and sing for money. The gangsters are about to make Jamal blind (because blind singers earn more) when Salim grabs him and they run away. Jamal and Salim jump on a passing train with Latika close behind them but Salim lets go of her hand. From then on, Jamal is compelled to find her and make it up to her. Salim falls in with a local gang while Jamal lives a more honest life, working as an assistant at a call center. He rescues Latika a couple times but always ends up losing her. In the end he wins the money and the girl. It's such as sweet movie.<br /><br />I was hesitant about seeing this movie when it first came out because it didn't look like it would be good from the previews. However, I decided to watch it when I saw it on the required movie list for my World Religion class. The whole time I was watching it I kept thinking, \\"I should have watched this sooner!\\" This movie ties in pretty well with the World Religions class. There is portrayal of the Indian caste system, which we have learned about, and the Hindu god, Lord Rama. Even though it was listed under the \\"Hindu\\" section of the list, I found it to be rather anti-Hindu. Jamal and Salim are Muslims and are victims of a raid led by the Hindus. Also, there is no mention of Karma, a large part of the Hindu religion. In fact the focus of the movie is on destiny or a divine plan, instead of Karma, which is commonly found in Christianity. There seemed to be links to multiple religions in this movie and therefore I think it relates pretty well to our class, where we are learning about multiple religions. Overall, it was a great movie. It sparked every emotion and kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series of episodes is fantastic.  Ive watched them multiple times and enjoyed them each time.  The eye witness interviews at the beginning of the episodes give each one a sense of realism throughout it that other WWII videos just dont offer.
B005PTYOTE|4.0|So, back to the missions. At first I was not impressed with these movies because they turned Phelps into a bad guy. Which really pissed me off, cause I was a fan of the series. But then I watched them again recently and realized they really were pretty good, and a lot more like the series then I remembered.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Gameloft is now forcing you to pay for tokens.  No scratch offs after 45 minutes.  A free app that makes you pay a minimum of $2 every three games?  Horrible.
B00428ZRFE|2.0|When I first recieved my package I was really exited to only open it and find out that the CD case was broken both outside and in. The CD was slightly damaged aswell and to top it of the CD came in poor package. Love the CD but unsatisfied with how it arrived.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game, makes me crazy sometimes but I love to play this game! It's gone through its growing pains, some changes take getting used to, but overall I still love the game! Would recommend to everyone that loves bingo!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love tower defense games and this one is my all time favorite, it is much better than the new btd battles
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the best series that I have ever read!  This Triology was amazingly descriptive and the details made you feel like you were actually participating in the Hunger Games. I think me reading this series in a little over 1 week when I work full-time speaks to how good it was 😄. Highly recommended!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I like this app. It is a lil calming when I play it. I enjoy the different horses and games it has. All though it needs to have other games to play other than the 3 or 4 it has. The horses are pretty though.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Being able to stream the four seasons of LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD was worth the price of amazon prime for one year!  Good quality family shows are not the norm in today's world.  During Christmas break two of my grandchildren who are in their teens plan to start watching the series. I gave the WIND AT YOUR BACK series to them last year & they loved it.  I understand the DVD 's from LARK RISE...... don't work in the United States so a subscription to amazon prime will give them the opportunity to enjoy this beautiful series.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Pleasurable, and fast paced read. This is a could be (should be) book.  Don't expect a movie, but enjoy a good book.

B00915G6MG|5.0|I hope you can answer a question for me.  I am buying movies now to give someone at Christmas.  So the movies will not be open till then.  If something is wrong when the movies are open in December can I still return the bad ones for refund or exchange?

B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Asphalt 8 airborne really lives up to its name especially since u are in the air most of the time it will take a lot of space on your kindle but it is worth it considering the beautiful landscapes and gorgeous graphics the tilt controls can be a little tricky at times but I am sure they will fix that in an update
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was hooked from the first chapter. Great writing, perfect pacing, and overall a terrific story. Still thinking about it a month after finishing it. That's the mark of a great book. A cut above the run-of-the-mill suspense novel. Quality work. Looking forward to reading more by Flynn.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Sometimes hard to follow the technical aspects and keep them in perspective to the story line. Overall it's a fun, fast paced read.
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|I can't find a reason to dislike this song. It's so sweet and tender, makes me feel full of life.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|It's the perfect backpack for middle/high schoolers.  It's really well built; it survived a whole school year of heavy use without any wear and tear!  Its multi-size compartments are capable of holding text books, folders, tablet, calculators, and bottled water.  The zippers are strong and easy to slide.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Awesome in most every way. keep the updates coming guys. Great game yet again. The telepod thing is marketing genius. And I'm sure it does not hurt the bottom line.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I really, really, like this audio CD. Hugh is not the best singer in the world, but he can (and does) play some good jazz. Am ready for his next release!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I think that this app is very helpful if you want to learn a new language. It is really helping me to learn Spanish. but it can be used for many languages. best language learning app I have found so far
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Starts off a little slow but then gets going at warp speed.  Great action with a little humor mixed in.  What starship captain wouldn't want Scottie on their crew.  Kahn was an interesting character in this one.  Hope to see more of him.  All around good one to watch.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I like it very much and I loved the Color.  It did exactly what I wanted it to do.  But the outside casing started peeling in a month that's my only complaint.
B00DYEBM2Y|5.0|There had been something missing from my life for the last 17 years, I just realized it is Mazzy Star. After listening to the first three albums on heavy rotation during that time, and embracing Hope Sandoval and the Warm Inventions, I have always felt forlorn that there was not more.<br /><br />But right now I am spinning Seasons Of Your Day on glorious 180 gram purple vinyl, and it is like the band has not skipped a beat. Atmospheric, but in a way that only Mazzy Star seems to be able to master. It is what we would come to expect from theses guys: sultry vocals, sparse, mixed with full arrangements, and competent song writing. It is wonderful. And the guitar interplay on Spoon (with the late Bert Jansch) is superb. You can really tell how much maturation that Hope has gone through in the last decade and a half, but that is in no way a bad thing.<br /><br />What you will find on this album is much more typical of the music on She Hangs Brightly, but with a down home, almost country feel. But there is no doubt in my mind that it is well worth the purchase, just for the last two songs alone. Flying Low is a fantastic way to end the album.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />The vinyl is mostly clean, with some rough patches of surface noise at the outro of side 2 and a slight warp bump on the intro to side 3. But all in all, I am very happy with pressing.
0345529057|5.0|Watching the show led me to the books. ASoIaF is such a pleasure to read, and makes me enjoy the great work of the actors in the show even more. Martin's epic fantasy will go down as one of the greats. Will note this is not the pinnacle of &#34;high literature&#34;, yet it is one hell of a ride.
B00DJZR46G|4.0|I think this is a good Elton John album, although probably not a great one.<br /><br />I think Elton's great strength as a songwriter has always been his ability to create a great tune with genuinely interesting and often original structures and harmonic backing. There are songs here which really do fall into that category - Oceans Away, My Quicksand and Home Again, for example. Oscar Wilde Gets Out, too, is a fine and genuinely passionate polemic about Wilde's mistreatment with very strong lyrics and which stands with Elton's best work. However, there are some which don't really shine after repeated listening for me - Dream #1 and Voyeur among them. They are perfectly OK but seem a little ordinary to my ears. And although My Quicksand is a really good song, it gets a bit self-indulgent (that \\"joke\\" Grieg quotation gets very wearing after a couple of hearings, for example) and would have been better if it were a minute shorter.<br /><br />Bernie Taupin's lyrics are still very good (I don't think he gets the credit he deserves as a fine lyricist) and the production is great. It's generally reasonably restrained which works very well with the songs here, and Elton's voice sounds good. He may not be able to belt it out as he did 40 years ago, but he's still a fine singer and can put a song across brilliantly, and it's good to see that he can still make a good album. Fans like me who have followed Elton John down the decades may not be set on fire but they certainly won't be disappointed.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|It was amazing! I can't believe I went this long without it! I would recommend this DVD to any fan of Daria.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|This movie was really good! We enjoyed every minute of it and were happy we could order it through amazon video before it was released in stores.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All I can say is &#34;Poor Peeta&#34;! Like many fans, I didn't read the series until the release of the movie. Needless to say, the movie did not do the book justice. I'm looking forward to reading more from Suzanne Collins.
B00957T6X6|4.0|So far this book it very hard to put down.  Great Characters and imagination! Makes you wonder how life was during that time.
0375869026|5.0|I like how the book is written in sections, each by a different character's perspective. I like the social issues this book deals with.
B00EDPFJA4|2.0|I believe this album's reviews will be split between the people who prefer his RnB/lyrical songs and the ones who like his rap/flow songs. I'm from the first category and have been disapointed with this album. I know he's not the best singer of all, but I enjoyed his mix of singing and rapping. There's usually one or two songs like that which I really love on his albums, but not on this one. They're all «meh» to me. I do like his rap, but even on that side this albums is lackluster to me. Maybe he wanted to change a bit, but I'd have prefered he'd grow out of his \\"Few believed in me, started from the bottom, now I got money...'' lyrics. Anyways, just my opinion...
B00DJZR46G|4.0|To listen to Elton John on \\"The Diving Board\\" is almost like listening to Elton Verite.  Producer T-Bone Burnett, as he and Elton were finishing up work on the Elton/Leon Russell collaboration \\"The Union,\\" reminded Elton that the first time Burnett saw him play, it was the legendary lives shows on Elton's first visit to Los Angeles. As a trio, Elton, a bassist and a drummer. Why, Burnette asked, have you never recorded in the fashion of those early lives shows, where you drew everyone's attentions as musicians?<br /><br />That is the seed of \\"The Diving Board.\\"  With just drums and bass, most of the songs are built on Elton's piano figures. With a touch of guitars here, a backup choir there, but mostly just the core players, Elton crafts some of the stateliest songs since his debut or \\"Tumbleweed Connection.\\"  Some may mistake the seriousness of the music for Elton being somber, but titles like \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight,\\" \\"Home Again\\" or the smoky title song prove to be anything but.<br /><br />\\"I Hung out with the old folks, in the hope that I'd get wise,\\" Elton sings at the beginning of \\"The Diving Board's\\" \\"Oceans Away,\\" about the families he and Bernie grew up around following WWII. It's just Elton and his keyboards for the beginning of the album. It brings the focus all back on Elton and that piano. There are even three instrumental interludes to let Elton stretch out between a few of the songs to remind listeners just how much of a talent Elton has been, before and after the outfits and crazy glasses. He remains an exceptional singer and instrumentalist.<br /><br />That is, as has been for many years (excluding a few breaks) with the invaluable assistance of lyricist Bernie Taupin.  Drawing on his experiences of his own past, Bernie brought Elton a collection of lyrics that are mature in nature but broad in scope. When they question the life of Oscar Wilde (in \\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out\\"), it resonates with Elton as a gay man who is free to live the life denied Wilde, who was essentially deported from England for being gay and then died broke and destitute in Paris. But it's an upbeat tune, reminding us that trailblazers sometimes are the first ones knocked down before others can take the journey that others have laid down for us to follow.<br /><br />From his beginnings to now, Elton's ongoing journey's there on \\"The Diving Board,\\" and it's still as good as many of us earlier fans remember it to be.

B003P2WO5E|4.0|Pretty good story but I'm not sure I'm sold on the format this author has used. The bouncing back and forth (ie: five years ago - ten years ago -  then back to the main story line) seem to interrupt the flow of the tale,  Perhaps that say's more about MY linear thinking style than the way the author presents his material. ???<br /><br />I am about half way through anad it is still a question weather I'll buy into the next book.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|If you like dystopian-style novels, then these are the books for you. Very good for teenagers who are going through that &#34;awkward&#34; stage in life: they want to be pretty, have everyone love them and be popular. Gives a very good view of accepting who you are and not what society says you should be, subtlety.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|A well deserved Emmy to Michael Douglas. I have never been a MD fan, but I am now! An absolutely fantastic performance. Matt Damon is great as always. I didn't ever recognize Debbie Reynolds. She was wonderful as Liberace's mother. I though Rob Lowe was hilarious as the plastic surgeon who looked like he'd been pulled a little too much himself.  A sordid look at a man with many skeletons in his closet. Maybe I'm not old enough, but how could anyone have thought Liberace was straight?
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Movie differs slightly from the book, but it can stand alone.  The flashbacks really help with the character development and make the plot more understandable.  The movie keeps your interest throughout.  I really enjoyed and would recommend this movie.
0743270754|5.0|I bought this book for my husband who loves history.  He LOVED this book.  Basically I said &#34;good-bye&#34; to him as I handed it to him and then said &#34;hello&#34; to him after he finished it.  He never put it down.  Whenever I asked him how he liked it, he just sighed, &#34;It's fabulous&#34;.  He said that the description of Lincoln's personality could not have been better.  He also loved &#34;the early years&#34; when Lincoln was young and getting started on his political career.  I'm not the fan of history that my husband is, but he says I must read the first 30 pages.  Then if I don't like it, I can stop reading.  He's betting I won't be able to put it down either.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book kept me reading it until the end!  I have recommend it to my friends.<br />The writing is excellent and the detail and descriptions were so well  presented that it was  hard to put down.

B00026WU9Q|5.0|It was during the Newport Folk Festival that Bob Dylan brought the electric guitar into his music and it was during the recording of his album \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" that he brought it into the recording studio. It was a very controversial move in Dylan's career that he moved away from folk music into rock, really folk rock, and many fans were upset by the move. To me it seemed like a natural move artistically which would lead to some of his most creative music. Case in point would be the album \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" which finds Dylan playing a collection of songs that some would be classified as folk and the rest as rock. It is a collection that not only totally works but would become one of Dylan's best albums created during his career. The first part of the album is the more rock sounding part with songs like \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" to \\"Maggie's Farm\\" to \\"Outlaw Blues\\" among the better ones though they are all good. The second part of the record finds Dylan going back to his folk beginnings with just him, his guitar and harmonica. \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", \\"Gates Of Eden\\" and \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" are not only some of the best songs here but I think represents some of the absolutely best song lyrics Dylan has ever written especially \\"It's Alright Ma\\" with some of the most vitriolic lyrics written since \\"Masters Of War\\". All in all this is like two albums in one with the two different sounds and feel to the songs. Then again this album came out as Dylan was bringing a change to his music going from acoustic to electric and it seems fitting that \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" have the combination of the two sounds on it as he was making the transition. This is certainly an album anyone who calls themselves a fan of Dylan has to have in their collection. Even for the most casual fan this is a must have record.
B009RX85N0|5.0|And never ever needs to end. I am very much addicted. Especially for a disney fan like me, who was raised on the classic cartoons-to see the same characters now in a more adult context is phenomenal.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Provided decent viewing entertainment; not Oscar worthy; may be given consideration for graphics.<br /><br />There's an underlying story to what is projected onto the screen.  Lots of symbolism. I'll leave that up to you to determine.<br /><br />It was OK.
B00D2PIUAM|5.0|Love this band. They keep delivering that feeling that it is hard to explain. Thanks Placebo, very few bands make me feel like you do (only two actually). I cant wait to see you live soon.

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Love everything about this album. This band is out of this world. The only thing I do not like about Dream Theater is that it makes all other bands I like sound bad. Its not fair to them. Poor rookies.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This first novel is the beginning of a heroic fiction novel that is truly different. All of the 7 books in the series average about 4.5 or so in my ratings and I like the series a lot. I can almost see myself as the young teen, wanting so much to belong and make a difference. Most people will like this line of books (she has many vampire books also). I did forget to say that on kindle the 7 books together came to about the same price as the new Lee Child. I love Lee Child's Reacher novels but the value and intertainment this series gave me was at least 3 or 4 of the Reacher novels...  《;¤}.....shu.  ADDED: Volume 1-3 and 4-6 are now $6 each bundles so it is even a better deal than before...they are also coming to the ninth book in the series. I read reviews saying the first book is young adult or earlier writing. At age 61 and 47 years of scifi/fantasy reading, I did not find it so but I have noticed effort by the writer bringing more adult subjects as the series has progressed.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|good minigames ok stroyline. just seemed to end. good long game. the graphics were goodbut does not magnify very well. a little pricey
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Good story line but the acting looked a bit forced at times. I enjoyed it with my kids. I would read the book series.
0553801473|3.0|I don't know if I enjoyed this book because I disliked `A Feast for Crows' so immensely, or because it was actually decent. Or perhaps it is neither. I was able to enjoy this book for what it was because I read `A Cavil on Chronology', a brief from Martin in the beginning of the book that says there will be another to follow. With this knowledge I did not expect any resolution - I was just along for the ride.<br /><br />That being said, Martin is long-winded. If you're going to read the series, it just comes with the territory. Accepting this, I still can't get past the feeling that he wastes a lot of the reader's time with chapters that ultimately prove to be unimportant (which is why I found myself skimming over a good bit of AFFC). But hey, if you're writing a money-making series, wouldn't you want to drag out the story over as many books as possible? Guess he learned a thing or two from Robert Jordan.<br /><br />Some of the character's conflicts, however, simply don't make sense. For example, when Stannis offers Jon Snow a lordship at Winterfell, Jon struggles with the decision. Even after he declines the offer, he laments what could have been. What I don't get is how Jon ever believed Stannis had the power and authority to offer such a prize, when he was fully aware of how few in the realm supported Stannis' cause. On the subject of power and support, how could the people of the iron islands be so delusional as to think they had any chance of conquering and ruling Westeros? I mean, what the hell? And what's with Tyrion? In the first three books we come to know him as a sharp, witty, and ultimately honorable man. Then suddenly he is a kinslayer who wants to murder a few other relatives and is riddled with wretched thoughts. It's like he turned into Cersei.<br /><br />It was nice to get back in touch with some characters, and there was at least a mention of Rickon, who seemed to have fallen off the face of planet. I found myself wondering, `What's the main idea of this series?' The answer seems to be: Rule Westeros (though with the way things are going, it won't be much of a prize when all is said and done). The first book endears us to the Starks, so we're going to root for them, right? Yet their position in the kingdom, as it stands now, is tenuous at best. Has Daenerys become the character we are now supposed to hope `wins'? At this point, I'm not sure what outcome I'm supposed to be hoping for based on how Martin has set up and developed the story. And that's one of my big problems with him as a writer, at least with regard to `A Song of Ice and Fire'.<br /><br />The series is interesting enough to keep me reading, though if we have another volume like AFFC I'll be pretty wroth. I acknowledge why he broke up the last two books the way he did, but I'm not sure it was the best story-telling strategy. Also, if you have to explain the screwed up timeline before a reader dives in, then perhaps you might want to re-think things. Plus it would move the story along more seamlessly if we didn't have to keep jumping back and forth in time, and we wouldn't have to wait as long to see what our favorite characters are up to. There's no telling how he will choose to divvy up the story lines in the next book, but here's hoping it is a more blended effort.(less) [edit]
B00CL0J99K|2.0|It's a hard watch after the avengers. story is very cliche and has a low grade script. studio cash out flick, will probably upset you like the dark night rises. i didnt like it much but rent it first before you buy if you havent seen it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. I usually get on it from my phone but I have found that using it on my Kindle is so much nicer when I am trying to make something and would like to be able to read the instructions. The BEST feature about having Pinterest on my Kindle is that when I am in Pinterest it doesn't time out. So when I am elbow deep in glue or food I don't have to poke the screen so that it doesn't shut off. It will eventually I suppose but I haven't had it time out on me yet. That way I don't run the battery down when I would prefer my Kindle to time out on other stuff. A Pinterest addict should not go with out this app.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Great CD. Great rock/roll and blues all together in a 2 CD set. Great guitar sounds and great vocals together.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this to give to my son in 11 years when he graduates.

I am sort of behind already since he is a 2nd grader but I can go back and get some of those signatures I am sure.<br /><br />Oh the Places You'll Go has such a great message especially for a young'n about to embark on their lives after high school. This is the perfect graduation book and I am excited to fill it with messages from the people that helped set him up for his trip in the world!!

B002BLZ6GE|5.0|for those of us who have no experience repairing our guitars. This book contains the only instruction I have ever found on guitar wiring that doesn't require a two year degree from ITT to understand. He makes it simple and that makes it worth the price of admission alone, but the other chapters are just as good. Dan Erlewine remains the standard by which everyone else in this business is judged. They are either as good as him, or not. No one is better.

B0030T1NAO|5.0|Some months ago I watched and reviewed season 1 of this amazing show. Took a while to get to season 2 as I've been paying loads of games lately, but now that I've completed season 2 I gotta say it's every bit as good as season 1, if not a bit moreso. Someone else in one of these reviews mentioned character development. That among many other things is a real strong point for season 2, I agree. Even the bad guys got great character development. Tuco is particular resonates as one of the greater psycho characters I've seen in a television show.<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT for Breaking Bad and for the video game Rage!!!!] Speaking of Tuco, I played Rage a year or so ago and was delighted to stumble across Tucos grill sitting on a shelf in the Sherrif's office! Twas funny as all get-out.[SPOILER OVER]<br /><br />Anyway, many people have said many things on this title already so I will wrap this up by saying if you loved season 1 season 2 is an easy win for you. Enjoy it!

(amazon actually made me give it something so I gave a one)I can't even believe I am wasting time writing this review. Do not make the mistake I made by reading this book.  I hated it! The whole thing, the whole idea of it.  I only stuck with it because my friend recommended it and said it was her top 5. I disagree.  It is a tragedy, and nothing good came of it for me.

1440503257|2.0|Is that the author isn't British. The food, even most of the non-muggle food in Rowlings books, are steeped British culinary tradition. They're British classics, or variations thereof. And while you obviously don't need to be a Brit to enjoy them, you do need to at the very least have spent a decent amount of time here to really understand them. Dinah Bucholz doesn't seem to even be familiar with a lot of them outside of references is Harry Potter. Highly disappointing.<br /><br />Bottom line, you're much better off looking up any foods from the books that you want to try. The classics should be easy to find in books, though you may need to get a specifically British cookbook, and there are lots of much better recipes for the wizarding foods dotted around the internet.

B000J1AGQI|5.0|The need for a movie to simplify and proceed at a fast pace forces the film maker to make choices regarding &#34;the truth&#34; versus the depiction of it.  Having seen the movie, then read the book and then once again viewed the movie now several years later I found the film maker's choices to be good ones.  It captures the essence of the leader, of the events and of the terrible cost of that particular war--perhaps of all wars.<br /><br />One particular element that tends to be ignored or glossed over in many war movies is that of the interactions among the families of the soldiers/sailors, who in many ways are fighting &#34;wars&#34; of their own -- family finances, family health, job pressures and isolation.  Without spending a lot of screen time on it, the movie provides a realistic look at that often unmentioned aspect of the totality of the conflict; and it also shows that the spouses of the officers have responsibilities that in many ways mimic the responsibilities of the officers themselves.<br /><br />A final comment on realistic elements -- ceremony is an important part of military life.  The ceremonies (of several types) are only briefly depicted, and not all of them involve more than two people; but again even the brief clips provide the viewer a sense of what a soldier (or sailor, Marine, airman) experience in the totality of preparing for and heading off to the war-fighting effort.
B00EF1PKJQ|4.0|Sarah's 3 albums are evenly-spaced 2 years apart (2009; 2011; 2013) and show remarkable progress from one to the next, and none more so than between #2 Follow Me Down and this latest release, recorded during her final semester at the New England Conservatory. Her foundation in acoustic bluegrass roots that was so prominent in her debut Song Up in Her Head four years ago is more of a distant echo of the past on Build Me Up From Bones. The songwriting is more sophisticated, the lyrical content more mature and personal, the singing more polished, and the music composition much more adventurous, diving into eclectic blends of folk, jazz, love ballads and even a light touch of neo-psychedelia.<br /><br /> Sarah made her name as a young mandolin prodigy and astounding vocalist with a musical sensibility far beyond her years. On this collection of 9 originals and 2 covers, she fulfills the early promise of her teenage years. The \\"bluegrass wunderkind\\" label has been relegated to the attic trunk - this is a fully-realized work of a grown woman with an old soul and 4 years of advanced musical education at a prestigious school that is tailored to help nurture geniuses in the field. By all accounts, NEC has served Sarah well. She has left her proverbial \\"comfort zone\\" behind.<br /><br />  A word of caution: people expecting a bare-bones, stripped-down rustic sound centered around a banjo or mandolin (akin to her debut record) will get fewer examples of that on this record. Sarah's mando is featured here on just 1 track (Joanna Newsom's 'Book of Right On') and her clawhammer banjo only on 'Fuel the Fire.' The rest of the album is dominated by her preferred instruments: the Fletcher Brock octave-mandolin, and her acoustic guitar. Much has been said of the project emphasizing her live concert trio configuration (Alex Hargreaves on fiddle; Nat Smith on cello), and that is true on 6 of the 11 songs. The other 5 make extensive use of session musicians and electric instruments, including Jerry Douglas on Dobro, Kenny Malone on percussion, Chris Thile on mandolin and Dan Dugmore on pedal steel and electric guitars. Also, as on her 2 other albums, guest vocalists appear on harmony, as well as overdubbed multi-tracks by Sarah herself. With the exception of the Dylan cover 'Simple Twist of Fate' (using only Sarah's voice and Nat's cello plucked like a bass), the album makes good use of the studio's tools to flesh-out the songs beyond the minimalist trio setup. Producer Gary Paczosa even indulges in employing audio special-FX on some tracks like 'Fuel the Fire' and 'Rearrange the Art' that couldn't be reproduced live without a soundboard equipped with ProTools. In fact, the latter track, which closes out the album, has a slightly late-60's psychedelic vibe coupled with jazzy Bela Fleck banjo stylings that showcases how far Jarosz's musical palette has expanded since 2009. If her sophomore album Follow Me Down was her Rubber Soul, this album is her Revolver, with a similar broad range of genres and influences that pulls the listener in to territories with fresh musical visions, showing Sarah's journey is taking her towards new horizons.<br /><br /> Ms. Jarosz is well on her way to establishing herself as a bona-fide original, creating a recognizable, idiosyncratic style drawn from numerous sources and forged into her own unique artistic identity.
0143113100|4.0|A little too anecdotal, but definitely worth the time to read.  I'm going to be looking for ways to challenge my brain!
B00F35BV64|3.0|While this is a very well-made movie, it had all the soul and vision of a paint-by-numbers kit. It looked like Star Trek but it didn't feel like it to me. Still, it's hardly the worst Star Trek film ever made, as some of the original TV show's fans have proclaimed. But there were scenes so hollow they made me wince, and (as in the last movie) the iconic characters are sometimes so far off the mark that no alternate-timeline fig leaf can excuse it. Star Trek was always about the potential of humanity, but this movie seemed barely touched by human hands.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|You couldn't ask for more.  Even the one-liners were exceptional.  This is real movie magic.  The most entertaining film I've seen in a very long while.  But then, I like anchovies on my pizza and you probably don't.

B00AKL1XPU|3.0|The graphics and sound effects are nice, and the game play appears go be fun. I think it will probably have the same issues as Ice Age, you will at some point have to spend money to really get into the game further than the initial beginning because the game makes it pretty close to impossible to get the bought currency by simply playing.
B000C20VPA|5.0|When watching this film you are taken into a world where greed reigns supreme.  It's all about money.  The dollar, dollar bills.  And, unfortunately, when money is your GOD some unsavory characters always make their way into the equation.  Robert DeNiro takes on the role of \\"Ace Rothstein\\" and truly when you see his potrayal you cannot think of anyone else playing this character.  Ace is hard working and very head-strong about what he wants and how he views Las Vegas.  He is controlling.  He is dapper.  He is logical.  And most importantly he doesn't want Joe Pesci's \\"Nicky\\" coming to town and ruining the empire that the mobsters have allowed him to run.  Joe Pesci is amazing.  And the only actor I know that can go toe to toe with Bobby D any day of the week.  I like watching the scene in the desert where Pesci lays into Deniro like no other.  This movie gives you such an interesting story and such a powerful dynamic between it's cast of actors.  Sharon Stone makes you sympathize with what she deals with being Ace's woman.  And you can't blame her for her actions when Ace knows full well how he met her and where she comes from.  Marty Scorcese does it yet again aligning a good story and quality players.  He probably could've filmed this blindfolded, but then again all of his boys are in it and that wouldn't have been any fun.  A good film that I recommend highly.

0307271609|5.0|This is a vivid and insightful examination of the life and times of the Chinese Dowager Empress Cixi.  Cixi is a much neglected and often maligned ruler; she has often been portrayed as a cruel, ugly caricature of the sinister Asian.  Much of that depiction comes directly from outright lies created by her enemies, some of which was only fairly recently revealed through archived documents.  The real Cixi was a genius who passionately and devotedly lived for her country and her dynasty at an especially turbulent time when the old traditional China was being bombarded by what the Chinese saw as an invasion of Western technology, aggression and greed.<br /><br />How many people today know that the Opium Wars were started by Great Britain to allow them to sell illegal opium from their empire in India to what they regarded as lowly and backward Chinese?  Other countries simply believed they had the right to take over chunks of China as they pleased.  Japan was especially aggressive and belligerent.<br /><br />As the Emperor and his advisors retreated further into the past and tradition, Cixi recognized that burying their heads in the sand would lead to disaster for China.  As a woman and with a rank of fourth concubine, Cixi had no power and no influence.  However, she was not only the mother of the Emperor's only son, but also a dear friend of the Empress, and the two, after the Emperor's death, pulled off a very slick and bloodless coup.  The Empress assumed the administrative chores, while Cixi became responsible for determining policy.<br /><br />Cixi filled her role from behind a screen as a female could not appear in the audience chamber.  She also had to enter the Palace through the back door as females were unworthy of the front door.  (When I visited the Forbidden City, I very much enjoyed the knowledge that I was walking in through the central axis, forbidden to women during the imperial period.)<br /><br />Cixi strove not only to maintain and defend China, but also to find the good that the West had to offer and apply it to China.  She brought technology such as railroads and telegraphs to China, as well as restructuring the education system.  She outlawed foot binding and championed women's rights and women's education.  (In one great scene, Cixi stopped an opera performance over lyrics degrading to women.)  She also planned a literacy campaign that would lead to an informed populace, with the ultimate goal being a constitutional monarchy.<br /><br />Cixi did make mistakes.  As the author, who greatly admires Cixi, states, Cixi was a giant, not a saint.<br /><br />This is a marvelous book.  The author has managed to cover about a hundred years of Chinese history, full of unfamiliar names of people and places, and make it clear, vibrant and absolutely thrilling.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Chinese, world or women's history.  I wish I could give it more than five stars.also to find the good that the West had to offer and apply it to China.

She also planned a literacy campaign that would lead to an informed populace, with the ultimate goal being a constitutional monarchy.<br /><br />Cixi did make mistakes.  As the author, who greatly admires Cixi, states, Cixi was a giant, not a saint.<br /><br />This is a marvelous book.  The author has managed to cover about a hundred years of Chinese history, full of unfamiliar names of people and places, and make it clear, vibrant and absolutely thrilling.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Chinese, world or women's history.  I wish I could give it more than five stars.
B00D1QBQ2G|5.0|Franco Fagioli has been one of the leading countertenors of the new generation for a few years now, ever since winning the prestigious Neue Stimmen competition in Germany in 2003. Recently though, with recordings like [[ASIN:B008R9QAY6 Vinci: Artaserse]] and now [[ASIN:B00DNVWS4Y Steffani: Stabat Mater]] as well as some sensational stage performances, his career has taken a dramatic new trajectory. This album from the French label Naïve catches Fagioli riding a wave of dazzling showmanship backed by an astounding technique beyond the dreams of most mortals.<br /><br />Fittingly, Fagioli has chosen here to reflect the theatricality and swagger, as well as the extravagant virtuosity of Gaetano Majorano, a compatriot of the more well-known Farinelli. The impressive 76 page booklet is full of anecdotes about his outrageous behaviour, both on and off stage, for Caffarelli, as he re-named himself, was quite the prima donna. He used various techniques to unnerve other soloists onstage lest they steal his limelight, and he wasn't averse to challenging those who crossed his path to a duel. (In the London of 1738 however, he met his match in Handel, who was well used to dealing with big egos. On the pretext of concern that Caffarelli may forget his lines in Faramondo, Handel accompanied on the harpsichord playing every note of his aria, as one might with an inexperienced and nervous singer. Presumably Caffarelli was suitably chastened.)<br /><br />Interestingly, on this CD Handel is conspicuous by his absence. The recital begins with a couple of arias for Medarse from Hasse's Siroe, the first showcasing Fagioli's Bartoli-like intensity in depicting the drama of a storm, the second designed to exhibit an equally important strand of technique, that of holding the long flowing line. And so we move through the repertoire of Caffarelli, each aria highlighting aspects of that extraordinary range and technical ability; from roulades to chromatic runs, Fagioli and Il Pomo d'Oro reflect the glamour and excitement which must have prevailed in an opera house at the appearance of these superstars.<br /><br />The booklet which accompanies the CD manages to be both scholarly and amusing, the richly reproduced illustrations giving a compelling glimpse into the life of this castrato assoluto.ect the glamour and excitement which must have prevailed in an opera house at the appearance of these superstars.<br /><br />The booklet which accompanies the CD manages to be both scholarly and amusing, the richly reproduced illustrations giving a compelling glimpse into the life of this castrato assoluto.

B009H75B2E|5.0|The Scottish Dunedin Consort has often been lauded for its fresh, transparent textures and beautifully proportioned and balanced sound, and following critical acclaim for their Baroque vocal releases, such as [[ASIN:B001355OUW Matthew Passion (Final Performing Version, c. 1742)]], [[ASIN:B000K2Q7PK Handel: Messiah (Dublin Version, 1742)]]) and most recently [[ASIN:B009G7WUOM Bach: John Passion]], they've produced what's to be hoped is a curtain-raiser to more recordings of the orchestral works.<br /><br />In the booklet notes John Butt observes that though the six concertos are highly structured, they are, paradoxically 'among the most carefree, joyous and spontaneous works that Bach ever produced'. Butt is able to create broad washes of colour which, combined with an energy generated from within the textural detail, drives the music onward with an effortlessness and inevitability. This fluidity is striking, possibly because many recent recordings of late have instead focused on producing a more rustic and even jagged sound. The flowing elegance here seems to bring out the French influence, and indeed the temperament which the ensemble have adopted is that of the French Court at the time, the low A-392. This in itself has a knock-on effect in slightly slowing the pace and thereby increasing the articulation of the instruments. It also adds a wonderfully warm glow.<br /><br />The idea of the opposing forces of 'disputation' and 'agreement' within the form of the concerto seem to have been a consideration in this recording, and certainly Butt could be said to to have achieved a truly euphonious result. The instrumental colours of the soloists in the Dunedin Consort are beguiling, at times dazzling, but always as part of the larger picture. Altogether the impression is of a fresh insight into works which we all thought we knew so well.

B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|For the past year, buzz about Scottish synthpop band Chvrches has been steadily growing. From appearances at major festivals like SXSW to touring alongside bands like Depeche Mode and Passion Pit, Chvrches have been doing their best to stand out in a sea of synth pop. And on their debut, \\"The Bones of What You Believe\\"--they do in fact stand out in the best of ways. Accessible and fun yet with an underlying aggression and angst paired with strong beats and a full bodied vocal, Chvrches has created an album that many established pop stars don't seem to be capable of making.<br /><br />Lead vocalist Lauren Mayberry deserves much of the credit for the success of this album. A lot of similar bands have girl vocals that are thin and whimsical, but Lauren has a fuller sound, better range and an uncanny skill at building layers of drama and emotion through tiny tone changes. She can casually get away with quite dark lyrics at times and still have the music sound very danceable and light given her sweet clear tone. Just like how it took me several plays of Foster the People's \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" to actually realize what they were singing about as the lyrics and bouncy tone are quite incongruous, Lauren's music has several similar moments though not to that extreme. Her lyrics have an intelligence and layer of complexity that is unusual, which may or may not be related to the fact that Lauren is highly educated with a full law degree as well as Masters in journalism.<br /><br />Musically, this album doesn't exactly break new ground but when playing the album through--the songs thankfully do stand out from each other which I find is my most common problem with synth based music. It's also more refreshingly straightforward than similar bands like Purity Ring. And yet-with Lauren's vocals--it still has the ability to stomp out major anthems for intense highs. \\"Recover\\" is mind numbingly catchy with a chorus that's going to wreak havoc with your subconscious. \\"Science/Visions\\" has a very ethereal almost movie score quality to it which is very interesting. \\"Gun\\" was just featured on the FIFA 14 soundtrack and suitably shiny and bright.<br /><br />Finally, if you happen to have a chance to see them live--do so. While they are naturally high energy with an infectious enthusiasm---they're also hilarious and self deprecatingly genuine. In short--though not musically brilliant, this album has so much going for it just entices and draws you in. It's like a will-o-the-wisp ghostly shining on a dark moor at night. You just can't help yourself but to follow. And dance.<br /><br />For fans of bands like Passion Pit, M83, The Naked and Famous, Purity Ring and Kate Boy.a very ethereal almost movie score quality to it which is very interesting. \\"Gun\\" was just featured on the FIFA 14 soundtrack and suitably shiny and bright.<br /><br />Finally, if you happen to have a chance to see them live--do so.

B003O86FMW|5.0|this book is so amazing! reading for the second time! It's the best series that I have ever read! I love it!
B00F5BON8O|5.0|It was Sarah's cover of the The Decemberists' \\"Shankill Butchers\\" off of her 2009 debut when she was just 18, that first put her on my radar. Haunting with incredible technical skill on both the banjo and the mandolin--she was incredibly exciting and yet collectively both her debut and follow up record fell flat for me. Quite frankly, it always just felt like she didn't have much to say which in my eyes is one of the worst things in the traditional folk world. It can't just sound good--it needs to be torn from your soul. This is where all that changes.<br /><br />\\"Mile on the Moon\\" has a crooning country atmosphere with an electric guitar giving it a little edge. Album title track \\"Build Me Up from Bones\\" is an early album standout and is a great example of how accessible Sarah can make traditional instruments sound. Soft and lilting with picked cello and fiddle notes, its refreshingly genuine and heartfelt. Sarah's take on Bob Dylan's \\"Simply Twist of Fate\\" is subtle with extremely minimal instrumentation--but sounds like its an original Jarosz song as she so completely owns it. Her other cover, \\"Book of Right-On\\" by Joanna Newsom is actually one of the album's few low points as it doesn't sound that different from the original as well as lacks Joanna's stunning quirk.<br /><br />This album was produced by longtime collaborator, Gary Paczosa (Alison Krauss, Dolly Parton) and also features a few guests spots with Chris Thile, Aoife O'Donovan, and Darrell Scott--but perhaps for the first time--the focus is consistently on Sarah and her band of two, Nathaniel Smith, and Alex Hargreaves. The music sounds more organic like it was all recorded together and less like it was just Sarah's parts with the rest dubbed. Her songwriting maturity is also on full display. Her use of second and third person has been replaced by Sarah finally being an integral part of the story.  And finally, I think the third thing which sets this album apart is the more expansive tone.  In the midst of finishing this album, Sarah graduated with honors from the extremely prestigious New England Conservatory--and I think everything she was exposed to there enabled her to both more more confident in her sound as well as branch out a bit.<br /><br />Sarah is part of a very exciting movement of young people who love traditional folk music yet understand how to frame it within a more modern melodic palette. Highly recommend. For fans of bands/artists like Gillian Welch, Valerie June, Nickel Creek.st of finishing this album, Sarah graduated with honors from the extremely prestigious New England Conservatory--and I think everything she was exposed to there enabled her to both more more confident in her sound as well as branch out a bit.<br /><br />Sarah is part of a very exciting movement of young people who love traditional folk music yet understand how to frame it within a more modern melodic palette.

B00FA5MU58|4.0|It has been about 20 years since Metallica has released a proper live album.  Yes, you can get copies of any show they play through their website, however the soundboard recordings sound a lot different than this well mixed live album that is coming out in support of their new movie.<br /><br />The classic Metallica opening of Ennio Morricone's \\"The Ecstasy of Gold\\" is here, complete with building insanity of the crowd \\"singing\\" along to the instrumental.  With the introduction over, Metallica proceeds to launch into Creeping Death and slam through a 15 song set with deeper cuts than you would imagine off a live album, especially one supporting a movie.  \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" is played along with the epic \\"And Justice for all.\\"<br /><br />Metallica sounds invigorated through the entire show, every song seemingly louder and faster than the last.  Hetfield's voice, which can be shaky at times during live shows is strong throughout the album.  And if that has been done through post production it doesn't show.  It just sounds like he is putting on the show of a lifetime.<br /><br />There are some odd choices in the set list.  It's almost shocking not to see crowd favorites like Seek and Destroy or Sad but True on the album as they both seem like vital pieces of a Live Metallica experience.  What is there is great however and there is the added benefit of hearing new versions of songs that are not often played.<br /><br />As a pure value proposition, it is hard to argue for 9.99 you aren't getting a lot of bang for your buck, especially if you like or have even had a passing interest in Metallica.
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|It felt more like a James Bond movie than a Star Trek. Producers of this movie need to have a little more respect for intelligence of viewers.

B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim is the best movie by far from the 2013 summer crop, is a no brainer pure fun slug-fest of monsters and giant robots that makes you want to be a kid again and believe in the simplicity of the fight between good and evil. It makes you believe in all the things we could do if we stick together as humans. This is a movie i was dreaming with for almost my entire life, since those magic Friday afternoons watching Mazinger Z in local channel for in Puerto Rico. Guillermo del Toro made a lot of people very happy, i know many to the point of tears. He transformed our childhood memories into heavy metal reality, and all of us who love sci-fi, anime, and fantasy are forever in debt to him and all the crew who made this film possible. Is the movie perfect? Well, no. To me there is only one perfect film, is call The Empire Strikes Back, perhaps you have heard of it. But the movie perfectly blends the mecha and monster genre from Japan. Part Mazinger Z(actually a lot), part Evangelion and part Gundam, add a little of Godzilla, some Gamera, add some drops of King Kong, and even a hint of Independence Day and you get Pacific Rim. Is a beautifully made film, the production values could not be higher, everything look and feels real, from the light, reflections, transparencies to the actually volume and weight of both monsters and machines. Is a dream. so I believe you should watch it, without preconceptions and take it for what it is, a high tech fantasy for that part of us that can still dream and be wondered. I went with my wife and son who is now four. We enjoy  every minute of it. In that scene when Gipsy Danger(the main robot) turns on that turbine in its elbow and punched that monster we all screamed -Puno Atomico!!!(atomic punch)from our Mazinger days. My kid asked me with a smile that i will never forget- Daddy is that Mazinger? I said- No baby, but is a very close friend. Thanks Mr. Del Toro and team, thanks from the bottom of my heart.
