B004LWZWGK|5.0|Fulfilling conclusion to the trilogy. It was the best of the three films  by Director Nolan. A film you can watch again and again.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The story was interesting, and the puzzles were challenging. I really like the option to change the level of play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent purchase. Thanks for the quick shipment and wonderful service for this book. My daughters love reading this series of books.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|this a great movie it keeps you on the edge of your seat,I GOT IT JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The cd shipped in perfect condition and before promised delivery date.  This indie band makes original heartfelt lyrics, has a simple tune, and is way better than I could have expected in concert.  I can't wait for their next album to come out.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book I read it in 2 days it was so good to read! I posted this on a Thursday.
159562015X|1.0|The entire book is a further description on what your personality test finds out about you. The code in the back of this book to take the test on the website was missing...therefore...the book was pointless and I had to go buy a new book from our local bookstore. As an fyi for anyone buying this book...be sure the code is available and unused in the back or, better yet, buy brand new from the store
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Thank the stars above for &#34;the Rock&#34;<br />it is encouraging to see a young guy, well my age to, that is proud of his country, and out there being vocal. plus the cd is awesome.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|There are some contradictions with the story line between the bulk of the movie and the end, but overall, I do like this movie a lot. Acting is great and the premise of the story is interesting and fairly original. I really enjoy Denzel Washington's movies a lot, so if you are a fan of his, you will likely love this movie as well.
B0059GVB5I|5.0|What else can be said, one of the best movies ever made about &#34;the Brook&#34;<br />Brooklyn is a great place to live and work, i should know i have done both.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I am a frequent fantasy reader, and this book captured me from the start to the end. I have read some of the other customer's reviews, and though I agree with some things, I really enjoyed Graceling.<br />The concept of the Graces is very interesting, the heroine is well created (sometimes too good to be true, but its the hero) and what I liked the most was the way Cashore handled romance. I liked the descriptions, not too specific but detailed enough to feel connected with the situation.<br />I found the end of the book coming too fast at me (I liked it so much I didn't want it to end) and also a bit uneventful, I mean, it brings no closure to the story and it really leaves you hanging. But it also invites you to read the sequel - prequel.<br />I was eager to know more about Katsa & Co, and I enjoyed the way everything is told from Katsa's POV.<br /><br />Overall, I totally recommend this book. I loved it!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love the music.  It is great if you want to wallow in melancholy for a little while.  It will pick you up and comfort you a bit.  I like to listen to is while I am doing other things.  She has a great voice, very mellow.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The hits just keep coming. Drama at every turn and doesn't seem to let up. I know the next book won't let me down.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I expected it to be funny, it was just dumb.  The story line just fell apart and continued to get more ridiculous as the film went on. We  would have not continued to watch it, had I not paid $3.99 for it!
B004W1GCQO|4.0|Good show for Season 1, but just might not like where the story is heading.  Easy to rent from Amazon and streaming.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game was great I really enjoyed the story line and the plot was well thought out and very nice graphics
0425263908|2.0|OK, WHERE DO I BEGIN...IF YOU READ 50 SHADES AND WERE GLAD WHEN IT WAS FINALLY OVER DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.  IF YOUR LUSTING AFTER MORE SEX GO AHEAD AND READ THIS ONE.  WEAK STORY, WEAK CHARACTERS, OKAY SEX SCENES. REALLY THE FIRST TWO WERE GOOD THEN AFTER THAT I WAS LIKE..OH NO NOT AGAIN...CAN'T THESE PEOPLE FIND ANYTHING ELSE INTERESTING IN THEIR LIFE OR ANYTHING BETTER TO TALK ABOUT.  IT GOT OLD QUICK.  AND NO WOMAN WANTS A MAN TO TALK TO THEM DURING SEX LIKE THAT...I GUESS THE WRITER WAS TRYING TO INCORPORATE A MALE DOMINATING THEME AS IN 50 SHADES, BUT IT JUST CAME OFF ALL WRONG HERE UNLIKE 50. I REALLY WISH I HAD NOT BOUGHT THE SEQUEL AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE I WILL NOT BE READING IT.  BOTTOM LINE, BORING.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A amazing book for some good laughs. Jeff Kinney always makes the best books for people of all age.  Bob
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|hope to read more of the group if its possible. any geek would love this book and the story wkthin
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|...else, even if you're Meryl Streep, he won't be happy! THIS is the gist of the movie. Roll end credits. Fade.    How do movies like this get made? Think of the number of hands scripts must pass before they get the green light. How did this become a movie?!    I physically felt ill for these two actors in some scenes. Surely they knew it was a flop, but being the consummate pros they are, the only thing to do is make the best of it. I can just hear them thinking, \\"The wrap will come. Just keep going.\\"    The one saving grace here is that Connecticut has some beautiful charming towns. If only this had been a documentary about those towns---THAT would have been enjoyable.    Folks don't waste your time with this one. If a friend offers it, make something up before it touches your hand, and don't take it! You will thank this reviewer for stopping you from throwing away 90 precious minutes of your life.
0756405890|5.0|Patrick did an amazing job with this novel. No plot holes, it's not typical or cleche fantasy, and it's simply beautiful to read. It breaks my heart because it sets the bar of greatness so high that I fear it may not be reached.
B005LAII1C|2.0|This flick starts off with a lot of hope. Mark Wahlberg has done enough successful dramas to make any comedic appearance a must see. He did not disappoint--he was serious enough here to reach the end with no criticism. Sure enough this guy has matured to the point where he can play practically anything and do it WELL.<br /><br />Ted? Well, having been a fan of The Family Guy in its early days, it is apparent that Seth MacFarlane's comedic mind probably stopped growing sometime in his Junior year at College. Ted IS Peter Griffin morphed into a computer-generated teddy bear. Nothing less. Nothing more.<br /><br />Had MacFarlane spent a few more days tweaking the jokes, the bear might have remained loveable as it was in the first five minutes of the movie. Settling for the sophomoric though made watching Ted a slow journey from laughter to intense dislike. By the end of the movie I thought it so apropos that Ted's soul was shredded into cotton balls and lifeless cloth that for a minute, the shock of seeing the bear resurrected totally destroyed my belief in karma.<br /><br />This movie gets two stars only because ZERO stars isn't offered to reviewers and because Mark Wahlberg hung in there to the end. Oh, and the girlfriend...what's her name?...oh, LORI! I hope Mila Kunis received a nice paycheck plus a bonus for being sucked into this sorted affair. I'll give her the other star.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Great movie, love the action and wow the star power.  If you liked the first movie then you'll definitely be a fan of the second.
B007D5DUBG|5.0|Taylor delivers again her unique classic hard rock sound.  If you liked Light Me Up, you'll like this EP as well.  There are three new songs and two live versons from Light Me Up.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|kids movie using adults language, really disappointed<br />They had a smart idea but could not came up with a good scenario
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|what can i say but i laughed my ass off. hard to think of a more enjoyable teddy bear ever
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love all three movies.  There was nothing wrong with any of the discs.  I would recommend this triology to everyone.  Everything was great.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I really liked the colorized version. It was very well done.<br /><br />Since it also has the B&W version, you cah have your cake and eat it too!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to win and simple enough that you can teach youth to play.  Moves fast and copletion can be done automatically or manually.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|The colorized version is very well done. Plus you have the B&W version it that floats your boat.<br /><br />It is nice to have both.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very fun game to play you will learn how to jump over trains and you have to collect coin so you can buy new things

B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|A really talented writer brings a very personal view to his travel through Australia. Easy to read with lots of explorations of out-of the-way places that I nw have on my &#34;must see&#34; list.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I gave this gift as a Christmas present to my husband, who is very much into lord of the rings, harry potter, magic the gathering & fantasy in general. He opened the wrapping paper & the box it comes in, that says the company name is very well presentable. He knew right away it was going to be something amazing. It's very well sealed, I couldn't take a peek before wrapping it. Also the box that cases the wand looks just like the harry potter wand box shop in the movies. However it is not made of any wood, it is all metal. He loves his new source of power over the tv! This was a great buy!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Nice twist at the end. Makes you think.I would recommend this book to anybody. Easy to read and realistic fiction.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|you think you won't like it but you will ,its awesomeness so cool  U WILL LOOOOVVVVVE IT take it from me I'm on level 6
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a fabulous book. I could  not put it down! I can't wait to start the next book in the series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Didn't like the end but loved the book.I would have wanted more action but the ending made some sense an  fit what had happened .this series is definitely something that people should read. Sometimes there is no good an  bad but somethings may never  change.the only thing that changes is the fact that you know the truth and what you do with the truth.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game works great and has no running problems. I also love that my kids love it and there are no bad or evil images to worry about.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it, great story it had me wanting more !!! Bedspread this year I can't wait for the movie
B007TNS6JI|4.0|aside from really having to buy the usual extras that these games require,  the action, graphics and  overall game are really better then most so called free games.
B0059XTU1S|4.0|So finally, we have the film that should have come out first.  Like so many readers, I was introduced to The Lord of the Rings by way of The Hobbit.  But when I finally read The Lord of the Rings it was a real shock - the multiple plot threads, factions, names, territories, languages, etc. made it difficult for me to follow.  With The Hobbit I had a simple point of view, a character I could relate to, and a variety of monsters and wizards that were alternately amusing and terrifying.  It's ironic then, that where \\"The Lord of the Rings'\\" depth made it fertile ground for a movie, \\"The Hobbit's\\" simplicity makes it more of a challenge to translate onto the big screen.<br /><br />Part of the problem is simply that \\"The Hobbit\\" movie came after \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  Although the characters are similar, they are not the same - the imposing Gandalf (Ian McKellen) we knew from the trilogy is a pipe-smoking goofball here who winces when his boss Saruman (Christopher Lee) appears.  Saruman is less imperious and more cranky; Elrond (Hugo weaving) more talkative and less imperious; and the dwarves are transformed from dour warriors to brawling roustabouts. This isn't necessarily out of sync with the spirit of the book - it's just that \\"The Hobbit\\" was written for a different audience, before the One Ring became more than just Gollum's (Andy Serkis) precious.<br /><br />There are numerous attempts to integrate \\"The Hobbit\\" into \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy that feel forced.  The rise of the Necromancer (Sauron) is grafted on to Radagast the Brown's (Sylvester McCoy) appearance, who is such a bizarre character that he feels like he invaded \\"The Hobbit\\" from another film.  And that film is Peter Jackson's repertoire of other films.  It's easy to forget that Jackson was a producer for \\"Bad Taste\\" and \\"The Frighteners.\\"  Jackson is now unfettered and can do pretty much whatever he wants, and if that means he wants to put a character with bird poop on his head riding a bunny sleigh, then by golly that's what he's gonna do! For fans accustomed the stentorian tone of the trilogy, Radagast will be quite a shock.<br /><br />Still, Jackson on a bad day is still head-and-shoulders above many other filmmakers, and his attention to detail will thrill fans of the series that are just happy just to revisit Middle-Earth. Sure, the monsters talk more, but their pedigree from the trilogy is evident in their flawless animation. There's enough goblins, orcs, and trolls to fill a Dungeons & Dragons dungeon.<br /><br />Gollum is the bright light here. It's clear Smaug is being saved for another film, the dwarves are too numerous to flesh them out as characters, and Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is just finding his furry footing. But the surprises that made \\"The Hobbit\\" so memorable have all been spoiled by the series that would come afterward: the ring's powers, Gollum's appearance, the magic tricks Gandalf pulls (turns out you just have to whisper to moths to summon eagles).  As so many fans have asked of the Star Wars series...would the movie franchise make sense if it was watched in chronological order?  Should it?<br /><br />The answer, unfortunately, is moot - \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy came first, and all \\"The Hobbit\\" can do, like Bilbo, is struggle to keep up.sleigh, then by golly that's what he's gonna do!

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game because wen you diy it makes you laugh and it is so funny you can not speek
B0034G4P80|5.0|We liked this movie as well or better than the Avengers.  The visuals of Asgard are stunning if you have a big screen tv, and Anthony Hopkins (Odin) and Tom Middleston (Loki) are great, as are all the other actors.
B001EN71CW|5.0|The menus are much better than on the DVD, the conversion to HD looks great. The only downside is that the extra features on the Blu-Ray are the same as were published on the DVD box set.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first 75 pages or so grabbed my attention and held it. Past that point, it was pretty obvious what had happened to the wife; I was mostly reading along to fill in details and get to the finish. Finish it did...but with a whimper, not a bang.<br /><br />The story is well-written and entertaining, but the author left 'way too much to do in the last third of the book. I think she was so busy resolving all the loose ends that logic--and a satisfying ending--kinda flew out the window. I found myself editing and rewriting even as I was reading, never a great sign. I think a good editor might have kept her on track and helped her to develop a better conclusion.<br /><br />That said, I'm glad I read it, I enjoyed all but the last 30 pages or so, and I want to read Ms. Flynn's next book. She's a potentially great author; I'm hoping her fourth book is the charm.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|When I first heard Kesha come on the radio, I was a hater. She was trashy. Shallow and a hot mess. I was so pset that I literally thought others were stupid for liking her. Then luckily I stopped caring about her as a rapper and I learned to appreciate the fun, in your face rap/electronic style she had to offer to the world.<br /><br />I'm not even giving enough credit when I say, Kesha's Warrior, is just amazing. This girl sings like the entire human race's existence depends on it and rocks out like we all have dreamed of. She sounds like a rock star on this album! The album has tons of diversity. From slow heartfelt poppy songs to the classic party your ass off synth beats.  Warrior is a great intro to the album although at first I thought eh, I now catch myself rocking out to it and singing every word. Then Die Young, starts and I realize why life is worth living like its gonna end. I hear that song and I literally just start having a blast no matter where I am or what the situation. After that we hear C'mon and I fall in love with it every single time I hear it. How can one girl find so many different ways to say the same thing?! I don't know but I hope she keeps doing it. We Are, is such an awesome song I can't wait to the song hits the radio so people know just how pumped up a song can make you feel. I actually love the entire cd. From front to back. If your ever feeling down or you just need a pick me up, this cd is for you. It's great when you want to let loose and just live in the moment being silly. I can't help but smile every time Kesha commands that I \\"put my mother f****** phones up\\"<br /><br />Buy this cd. Buy it again for your friends and pass around this amazing album. You money couldn't be better spent.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Ted is about a cuddly cute teddy bear that isn't cuddly or cute, or even remotely interesting. I got the big joke in the trailer--a fluffy teddy bear that's into cussing, hookers and a toke or three--and kinda expected the movie to expand on the theme and take it somewhere.<br /><br />It didn't, or at least it didn't in the first 20 minutes, so I switched to something else. Maybe it got better after that, but by then I could have cared less about any of the actors, especially Ted. Think \\"Fred Flintstone with a mouth and a wicked hangover,\\" and you've pretty much nailed the teddy bear and his movie.<br /><br />I did get a kick out of the southie (Boston) accents, made me homesick. But that's about it.
0143034901|1.0|Not my cup of tea,but a book club recommended read. Very dark and repetitive plots. Mysterious and has the patina of Spain.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A friend recommended the series and I got the book.  She was absolute right.  It does grab you and leaves you wondering how it is going to develop.
0446693804|5.0|I read The Notebook, The Last Song and A message in the bottle. I love them all. And I also really like A walk to remember. Will continue to read more novels by Nicholas Sparks!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Couldn't wait to get this book after finishing the first one.  I'm looking forward to the third one.  The series should be a required read on why to avoid a war if at all possible.  In this case, it wasn't avoidable.
B008OTTRXU|3.0|I like &#34;Call me maybe&#34;. And I also like other songs by Carly like &#34;Good time&#34;, &#34;Tug of war&#34;. Her voice is great. But this album is not what I expected. I was hoping more songs like &#34;Good time&#34; but it ends up with those songs, which both melody and lyrics are not good.
0547884591|5.0|Time Ferriss, is one of the most amazing people on the planet. The book, as many of his projects does, emphasizes the simplicity in (for this topic) cooking. The book is also laced (and Time could not have done it any other way) with diet and nutritional support that is true to the Tim Ferris 4-HR. Body book of his. I got it, first by preordering on my Kindle but realized I needed the hard copy in my library and am glad I ordered the second book because of the color coding sections that make it a very handy \\"go to\\" book for Cooking. I should also mention, if you love this book, and you will, you should read his first two books.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I love One Direction!!! And this album is much higher than what I expected. All those songs are so great. I can't compare Take Me Home with Up All Night, because both are perfect! There is a little more guitar in this album. And I love it!
0062060562|4.0|I highly recommend this book. It's a creative and thrilling story, about the life of a woman who suffers short-term amnesia. Everyday, when she wakes up, she doesn't know where she is and what happened the day before. Her memory is good for long-term situations (when she was a teenager or a child, for example), but does not work on the day-to-day. This is the context for an exciting psychological thriller. Yes, the first pages feel a little bit slow and the ending might feel a little bit rushed, but overall this is a great book. I read it in 3 days, and I was not planning for it (not even close to it). At a time, there just no way to put it down. Highly recommended.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I was disappointed as the antagonist was just annoying! He shouted...a lot! I loved 1 and 2 and was hoping for the same in 3. I would suggest you rent it first before purchasing this one. Good luck!
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This will help you fine tune your talents and better understand yourself. All around good read. Definitely recommend-- regardless of where you are in your career.
B00004THAY|5.0|These two are by far the best. When I play it, it puts me in a great mood. I loved reading the booklet on how they ended up playing together
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Totally boring...Took if off the Kindle as it just wasted space and was not going to play it.  Would not repurchase.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I hate that I spent good money on this book, the author has to be in middle school, and have little to no life. I can't believe it was was hyped so much. Can't be adults reading it.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's just ok.  Skill level is elementary and I don't really play it, but keep it on my Kindle in case I get bored with the other games.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This collection of poems written by anonymous cats is a wonderful and sometimes hilarious, sometimes chilling glimpse into the feline world.  Highly recommended!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I picked up and read this book in two days, it was so gripping. I felt the characters and story were much deeper than in the first book, and while Katniss is pretty whiney, the rest of the characters are great. The story flows quickly and there's a ton of action. Good read.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Thanks for downloading this book! Not! You wish that I was thankful! As if! I'm not happy because it sucks!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie is not worth all the hype. There were a few funny parts but past that its just not really worth spending any money to see.
B0051OZ564|3.0|While this is a dark, graphic movie, filled with scantily clad young women in peril, it turned out to be anti-climatic, as the story line played out. I good one time watch.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I like this movie and play it through Amazon Instant video is just great.<br />I fully recommend it, worth it.
1451627289|5.0|Purchased this as a gift.  Received quickly and was packaged appropriately as not to scratch the cover.  The book looked great.
1614270198|5.0|Had this book years ago & lost track of it, then FINALLY got around to adding it back to my library. This book gives GREAT insight on not only the power of the subconscious mind but on how to use &#34;practical, working&#34; applications & techniques to improve any situation. Glad I got it back in my arsenal!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Optics and options are good but completely blocks my screen; preventing me from  viewing the time and all incoming calls and texts.
B007EECSFA|5.0|It took me a while to really get involved with this novel and its characters, but once I did I could not put it down!  This is a lovely story surrounded by a great mystery.  I highly recommend this book.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|Glad i did not go to the Movies to see it. It's more of a Made for TV movie.  The characters are a bit over top and unrealistic making it funny. It was a good way to kill 2 hours on a rainy cold night.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Excellent mindbender, relaxer and oasis of calm to use for zoning out during a stressful moment. My children will even sit quietly to watch me play and to play it themselves.  Ahhhh quiet moments...
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|Great read which kept me enthralled until the last page. Incredible story. Love the way her books jump between past and present.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved this book. I had fun while reading it and always had a hard time putting it down. I just wanted to find out what happened next.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I'm only thirteen, yet I read this in three days. I chose this rating because I enjoyed reading this book. It intrigued me due to the fact that it seems like something I myself would write. Half the time I was reading this I was able to guess the probability of what would happen next. Not because of common sense, just because it is literally very similar to my writing, as I mentioned before. To sum it down, I just plainly LOVED this book:)
B001AQO3QA|5.0|She apparently never saw all the Special Editions. This was her favorite Xmas gift because of the extra scenes! Yay!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book drew me in immediately. It has been quite a while since I have been so consumed in a book and its characters like this one. I laughed and cried and felt like I was living every moment with them. Now that I am finished and emotionally drained from it I need a nice chapter break but I can't wait to go back a read it again.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Great way to fall asleep & stay asleep. Lots of sounds to choose from and being able to combine sounds as well as being able to choose how long you want it to play (even continuously) makes it very easy to fall back to sleep again if woken. Better than any sleeping pill & a lot less expensive.
B009A87Z6U|4.0|all the above movies are very very good and enjoyed by seeing them. I sincerely recomend these movies to others
B00846REIS|5.0|These are amazing books!! i hope to find more like them! This one i love just as much as fifty shades but I see in this one how much more the characters seem to fit.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie because I love comedies and Marky Mark... however I actually couldn't finish watching this. It had a lot of potential but it lacked originality. I heard that children who watched it without their parents permission (because it has a lot of adult content) really loved it. If you like repetitive fart jokes and enjoyed the American Pie movies, this is the film for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books have made me want to go out and read a ton more like them. I love romance books thats hot and steamy which is why i enjoyed twlight so much! But these too it up a level.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|If you like the other Ice Age movies you will probably be able to make it through this one too.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Didn't want it to end!! cant wait for the 3rd one! It is similar to Fifty Shades but has a whole different feel in it that i Love!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent show...love the series great suspense... streaming on amazon was alittle slow so that was difficult to watch, lost the last 2 minutes of the show.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books once you start you have to read them all as fast as you can. You cant help but want to see what happens between the two. I fell in love with the characters!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I think this game is wonderful. Not only do I enjoy it, but so do my 11 year old daughters. Great game
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is for sure one of my favorites, even though i have them all on my kindle, I'd like to have hard copies too!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great combo that includes a small art work pamphlet. Blu-ray is the way to go to watch this epic trilogy, I would recommend this to all.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this whole series i cant wait for the rest of the movies to come out. I fell in love with the relationships between the 3 characters.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Have this app on my iPhone so downloaded to my fire too. Great game & easy to operate settings. The pop up adds are horrible but I don't know if that is the game makers fault so I gave it 5 stars. I really don't understand why the adds are there, cause they don't make me want to buy the items, they make me NOT want to buy them!!!! Good game!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Actioned packed and I love the relationship with her and Gale. I was hopeing they would end up together the whole time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love pinterest....I have got ideas for my house, dinner, crafts, and even some ideas for my daughters wedding!!<br /><br />I'm on pinterest as much as I'm on Facebook!!!!!<br /><br />Love, love it!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Another great one i couldn't put down, I couldn't wait to find out how it ended to get to the thirs one.
B0082RX1P4|5.0|If you want an entertaining narrative interspersed with a unique perspective on company culture and customer service, this book is it!<br />  Tony Hsieh breaks the book into three sections:<br />-The first deals with Hsieh's early life, starting businesses as a kid (not unlike Warren Buffet's childhood); his academic career and first job out of college, culminating in the sale of his first successful startup-LinkExchange; and his initial attempts to become a venture capitalist.<br />-The second outlines his concentration of effort in making Zappos a very successful company, starting with near zero sales in 1999 and growing the company to over $1B by 2008.<br />-The third section describes their \\"investor realignment\\", culminating in the company being acquired by Amazon.<br />  However, THE REAL STORY is how this organization developed a unique company-culture that strives for genuine, meaningful relationships with its vendors, employees, and customers.  Its closing challenge is to consider what \\"true happiness\\" is and how organizations can make a difference in helping fulfill that goal.  This book is a very fast read, and I would recommend it for anyone leading a team and wondering how culture can make a difference in a company's performance.
B0060AY85C|5.0|Have always been a fan of Toni Morrison. Had this book less than a week and over halfway done already. Another masterpiece by a literary legend.
1476712042|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  In fact, I have read it twice!  I am looking forward to reading \\"Walking Disaster\\" from his point of view.
B003O86FMW|5.0|LOVE this book!! It is such a good book. So intense, and don't have a clue what is gonna happen. EVERYBODY should read this book they'll love it! Just make sure you read the first one lol
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Child's has kept his pace with this story. Teacher carries his audience along at a blazing speed. Top score.<br />Recommended for anyone who can stand the pounding pace.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|This movie was adorable. I loved it. Got me through my boyfriend's dentist appointment lol. It wasn't what I was ecpecting it to be but was still good and would watch it again.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I thought this is great game! I got it on my laptop and I couldnt stop playing it! For all of you who don't know~ unlocking the game won't unlock the door the the managers office. You have to figure out how to open it.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|My teenage daughter asked to see this. Great movie. Some tense times, but worth it in the end. Good mother & Daughter bonding movie
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love pinterest. Lots of useful info and DIY projects!!! I am an assistant teacher and have used some pinterest projects.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a must see, for all ....guys, single, married, to-dads, gals, moms, single women, christian. A Truly Family show!!
B000YHG72E|4.0|Although not a blockbuster, the movie was entertaining and fun to watch.  Good clean movie for kids to watch and enjoy.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|My husband loved this movie! It was action packed and interesting. Not boring for any of the family. Must see
B0086700CM|3.0|I said ok because after a few days the game wouldn't let me tilt and it was driving me nuts. This game is fun and all but there are many things wrong with the whole thing. Please get it but be careful. Hahaha
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Was unable to see the movie when it first came out. Was glad to have seen it on Amazon Prime. Will be purchasing the movie.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|she can sing, and if she can't, its more interesting then the other s*** that's out there, so shut up and enjoy something different for once people, everything else out there sounds the same, at least she's creative, jesus
B0096PAA6E|1.0|I have been waiting for this release for almost a year.When I finally got to listen to it I tought something was wrong with my speakers.It sounded so foggy that the recording must have taken place in the Fernando Valley.Was there a sound ingeneer on site?This is inexcusable.Gary Clark deserves better and one expects better from Gary Clark....
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|Fincher pulls off the conceit of aging backwards like no other director could have by being confident in pulling it off straight forward and changing the original story a little with a great script by Eric Roth
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This was a lot of fun.  Anyone who likes Pictionary will like this.  the only thing I don't like is that I can't seem to find a score between my opponant and me.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|all the songs are great and they get better and more interesting the more you listen to them, they grow on you and then you can't stop listening
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Loved this movie.  Tongue-in-cheek view of the eighties rock scene.  Tom Cruise can really sing!  Highly recommend if you like rock music.
B000L212HC|5.0|he can do no wrong and will always make classic after classic, 8 and counting people, buy this stuff okay
1452110581|4.0|Very cute book.  A few poems aren't for young children, but all of the others are very funny, if you know cats.  The book came on time and in good condition.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|this is a great collection and Springsteen adds the full out body of musicality that the songs deserve, but the Seeger originals are classic too for the stripped down music lovers
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|I bought this based on the great reviews but compared to most of the other games I've played, this was a complete waste of time! I have no idea what those people are talking about!!<br /><br />The graphics are mediocre, there is absolutely no story (which I wouldn't even care about if the rest was good), the response time is slow when you tap on something and there are no help/tips or guidance aside from some simple text. Even in the 15 mins I played this there is no interaction with another character or anything \\"moving\\".<br /><br />There are too many better games out there so don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />I played this on my Kindle Fire
B001L5SXQG|5.0|if you get this, get the deluxe, because the sessions video is a can't miss and the music video song is not on the album and is a very interesting Johnny Cash-like tone poem only Springsteen could replicate
0375432302|5.0|I am overwhelmed by this remarkable novel that totally blew me away, with its richly detailed narrative and intricate plot. Sat on the edge of my seat in suspense throughout this has to be one of the finest mysteries ever written, with the author adding such realism (via facts and atmospheric elements) as to bring the story to life. Fascinating, intriguing and so interesting this absorbing book is one that captures your interest as you loose yourself within the most intense, dramatic and momentous mystery of all-time. Wow! This extraordinarily brainy thriller is just perfection itself and which not since reading Harry Potter by JK Rowling, have I been swept away by this breathless chase and compelling tale. Lies and deception amidst truth shrouded in secrets and secrecy where intrigue and menace mingle; the enigma that is piled on secrets and stacked on riddles will have you guessing until the very last page. This amazing, astonishing tale was so full of fascinating detail that I just could not get enough of Dan Brown; hence I can now honestly say that I am a ardent fan.<br /><br />Harvard Professor Robert Langdon one night receives an urgent phone call whilst he is staying in Paris; stating that the elderly curator (Jacques Sauni&eacute;r&egrave;) of the Louvre has been brutally murdered inside the museum in the Grand gallery. Alongside the body the police have found some baffling codes and as Langdon together with renowned Cryptologist Sophie Neveu, try to decipher them and uncover the message that the Professor was trying to give other secrets are being hidden from them both... As they sort through the bizarre riddles they are stunned to find that it leads them to the works of Leonardo Da Vinci - suggesting the answer to a mystery that stretches deep into the vault of history itself. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine code and quickly assemble the pieces of the puzzle, a stunning historical truth will be lost forever.<br /><br />This fast-paced, action packed story is one that never looses momentum with the chase never letting up until all the pieces of the puzzle are found. The entire concept is just pure genius and which is so exceedingly clever, and a masterful achievement by an author whose writing has exceeded all expectations for a wide-readership. Facts within the book include:<br /><br />*The Priory of Sion - A European secret society founded in 1099, which is a real organization. In 1975 Paris's Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale discovered parchments known as Les Dossiers secrets, identifying numerous members of the Priory of Sion, including Sir Isaac Newton, Sandro Botticelli, Victor Hugo and Leonardo Da Vinci.<br />The Vatican prelature known as Opus Dei is a deeply devout Catholic sect that has been the topic of recent controversy due to reports of brain-washing, coercion and a dangerous practice known as `Corporal Mortification'. Opus Dei has just completed construction of a $47 million national headquarters at 243 Lexington Avenue in New York City.<br /><br />*All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals within this novel are accurate.<br /><br />The Bishop Aringarosa and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; the albino Silas are two characters whom really stand-out within this novel of good VS evil, propelling the exciting plot on as you plunge head-first into a most thrilling tale. Murder, lies and secrecy envelop you as you follow Robert Langdon and Sophie on their quest to expose the truth beneath all the camouflage and out into the open. I never thought that I would be so deeply moved by a graphic, explicit and at times horrific thriller that was bloodthirsty and driven by ambitious men who in the name of God took the liberty of concealing one of the greatest secrets of all-time. Dan Brown's masterpiece is truly epic, mind-blowing and totally spectacular therefore I cannot enthuse enough about it nor praise it more highly - as this is not a genre that I would read often. Mind games are played as you unravel the past which cleverly merges into the present, linking us to our past in such a way that is astonishing and awe-inspiring. If you are looking for adventure, danger, twists & turns and those moments that send chills down your spine then this is a must-read!!!vel the past which cleverly merges into the present, linking us to our past in such a way that is astonishing and awe-inspiring. If you are looking for adventure, danger, twists & turns and those moments that send chills down your spine then this is a must-read!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game works great.  My only problem with the game is you have to git rid of  the pop up advertisements before you can play.  Sooo frustrating.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|The Blue-ray disc had a portion of the movie where the sound cut off completely. I have returned the product for a refund.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This movie is another good throwback to the action movies of the 80's.  All of the big stars of that time get their due here, and all get some pretty funny lines.<br /><br />The story is a little weak and none of the acting will win any awards, but as long as you know what to expect going in, you should have a good time.
0062124293|4.0|I felt a little silly reading this book in public because of the look of the cover art and title. It's so distinctly &#34;I'm a girls' book for girls!&#34; looking... which is really disappointing because it's a fun read and made me think about gender in a slightly new way.<br /><br />It also acted an introduction to some gender thinkers and writings that I should have already explored.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie is very good.  You just don't want to overthink the time travel mechanism, as you can easily see some plot holes.  This movie is all about the story, and does a great job of making you care about as well as dislike both versions of the Protagonist.
B003L77GRY|5.0|This blu-ray disc allow you enjoy this great serie. Also, the quality is the best. In my opinion, this season is one of the best.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Fun movie. Do not like the interaction of the so called cool crowd. I did like the pirate. Choice of voices on new characters are questionable.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|As much as I love Johnny Depp, and as much as Depp throws himself into this movie, it just still kinda sucks. I also love Eva Green -- A LOT but that also doesn't help.  The script just sucks, plain and simple.  The plot sucks.  A limp, lifeless movie.
1416987118|5.0|The book captivated my 2 year old and 6 year old grandchildren! Abby told me it was her favorite book!!!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I knew this would be a diamond in the rough, but I had no idea just how awesome this movie would be.  Oh-so-funny, even my husband loved it (the commentators were his favorites, of course, but I saw him tapping his foot along with the songs, too!). :)<br /><br />Definitely recommend this to anyone with any sort of musical bone in their body, or for anyone who can appreciate a good comedy that occasionally veers off into the realm of toilet humor.  Loads of laughs!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I liked the movie, what was a bonus, is the song that played at the end of the film.  Florence & the Machine - Breathe of Life.  I ended up purchasing that song and a couple of others from the group.  Would recommend watching the movie just to see the end and be able to watch that with this song.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|a great film. Glad to have it. Service was excellent and I'd order again. Rarely watch movies over and even more unusual to purchase one! Worth the price. :)
0062124293|3.0|I resisted reading this book for as long as I could (about 12 months in the end), as seeing every other woman on the subway reading this book put me off. However, my friends insisted that far from being a cliche-ridden \\"new woman\\", self-help guide, it was funny and inspiring. They were right, in part. How to be a Woman sets out to be the new-feminist voice of a generation; to deal with the big issues (well bigg-ish) that make their way into modern women´s lives (well those in the global north at least): botox, marriage, children, abortions, clothes, strippers, etc, etc. I applaud Moran for her energy and efforts in being a new voice for young feminism, women´s equality needs new and brave voices like her. However, I felt that she did end up relying on cliches, her determination to be \\"hip\\" and to make feminism \\"cool\\" meant that she underestimated the readers intelligence in large part, and presented an odd anti-feminist revisionist vision of women´s role in recent history (claiming that women have not made an impact in music until the 2000s - Billy Holiday!, Janis Joplin!, Violeta Parra! Mercedes Sosa!  Cesaria Evora!) and even more worryingly that they have made little impact in human history - how completely mad! So it is worth a read, but a cautionary one.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Just loved this book. It was really interesting. Loved the characters in the book. Can't wait to read the next book.
B0095R64AO|4.0|This was a great movie, although it was quite long.  It was even more funny than we expected, Emily Blunt is fantastic!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so fun and awesome I don't Like the energy though and that's my review. GET IT NOW
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I used to be a HUGE fan of the Resident Evil movies, until they started adding 3D effects.  This movie and the prior were both horrible.  Too much time was taken to make &#34;cool 3D scenes&#34; and not enough time was taken to develop a plot or the characters.  How dissapointing.
B00005JLEU|5.0|it brings out your inner child and wonder about the other world. From a person who studies the philosophies and theosophy knowledge. It paints the picture of what can in the ethiric planes (dream world) or other dimensions. having a back ground in pagan wiccan studies and lore, they say don't eat anything from the fairy realm because you will get stuck there, and can't find your way back. Just my thoughts about it. Wonderful movie though. I also would suggest to have the audio in English, and the litteral Japanese translation subtitles to compare what the thoughts of the movie is. Chihiro is so soft spoken in the Japanese language, and very loud and annoying in the english version because of culture. Westerners are considered loud and obnoxious in modest Asian countries.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|I was already familiar with the starch solution and Dr. McDougall.  I also was already a vegan, but vegan does not neccessarily mean healthy.  After all potato chips and oreos are vegan.  Now as I am reaching 60 I am determined to have a &#34;healthly&#34; golden years experience.  It isn't easy.  If you are serious, really serious, about improving your quality of living 100 percent and don't want to live your golden year fat and out  of shape and want to feel great, then this is the program that can get you there.  You won't be hungrey, you will feel wonderful as you norious your body.  It will be a drastic change for some, but it is worth it as you can reverse hearth disease, get rid of diabetes and lower you cholestrol.  If you think you and your family are worth the effort, than this is the solution for you.
0312965788|5.0|This was a book that I had never read but heard lots about.  It's very good and anyone who is a animal lover and loves 'slice of life' books will enjoy it!
1405881186|4.0|Great dictionary. Able to provide various versions of the pronunciation (both british and american pronunciation). slightly bulky to carry around.
0061733199|5.0|This is a great book, it really goes over different areas. Some information is common knowledge but still a great book.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I loved this book.  The A&E series got me interested in this author.  I will be getting the rest of the series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! Not much more I can say! I am addicted to it! Great app also! Cannot get enough
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I loved the humor and the songs that were mashed together.  There were some drawn out parts in the movie.Storyline could have gone a little faster, but it was alright.
B00136Q4P0|4.0|Great tracks selected for this album, I'm glad this is the one I chose to purchase from Amazon MP3 download
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|For me, there are too many games to understand. It is also confusing to me to figure out the stages. I have difficulty directing the sling.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Mahjong deluxe good brain exercise and a lot of fun, easy to play and understand.<br />Requires good eye and brain coodination
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I love reading this book. It is a page turner. Once you start reading, you are anxious to know what's coming next. The story line is good. They got married in a drunken state without knowing much about each other. They both has good body chemistry but at least  she took the time to know him before starting a sexual relationship.  Very good.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|One if the best books I have read in a while. I liked it so much I read it twice. Abby and Travis are two flawed people who were lucky enough to find each other.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|This game takes the puzzling aspects of Bejeweled and adds a flair of fantasy battling.<br /><br />Connect 3+ of the same symbol and you deal damage/gain power in order to defeat your opponent.<br /><br />The game is mostly on rails, with an option to play either the story or random battles. I remember enjoying the Xbox version when it came out back in the day, and it plays almost exactly the same.<br /><br />Worth a few bucks.
009193768X|5.0|I had just been to London for my first and probably only time and was completely unaware of Fortnum & Mason up until walking into the duty-free shop in Heathrow airport. There I found their products and some rose biscuits that were to-die-for. Wanting to reproduce them (since shipping from there would unfortunately be rather extravagant), stumbled upon this book with a key recipe. Multiple recipes look absolutely scrumptious and I'm looking forward to trying them. The book is not just recipes, in the beginning there is actually a history of tea that is a pretty interesting read! Nice illustrations and photos in this book - it's well put together. Nice little book that would make a cute gift for anyone enthusiastic about tea.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Was really off key. A totally formulaic film. Insert rite of passage, college accapella culture- into fist pumping underdog scenario.
B009PAETCG|3.0|This game has very nice graphics, but the premise -- hitting a target in a soccer net -- gets old after a while. This company's American football field goal game is better.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|you get to go on quests. you can find objects like paper and keys. there r many tools to use like fire and snow freeze!! this game is great!!
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|The homie T.I. easily dropped the top album of 2012. It's not everyday that a rap album goes hard from start to finish, but trouble man conquers that feat!
B0081J95TE|5.0|Another great album by Garbage!! Its almost like they never took a break!! Reminds me of when i was in high school and college, great music and great times!!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great game play and excellent graphics! story line was pretty good as well. No time to get bored playing this game...lots of things to do. Overall a great game just wish it could have been longer.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such an awesome book! I definitely recommend it! I wish I could find a guy like Holder! I'm going to have to read another one of her books.
B000002GYR|5.0|Several great songs. Fantastic first album. Great insight to tom waits beginnings. Would definitely sugest for the music lover in your life.
B00993FEUK|1.0|This movie was horrible. I don't even know where to begin. In the first 15 mins they have talked about \\"violence and sexuality.\\" Then it just got worse from there. There was virtually no story line and my 6 year old was scared of the movie so he hid his eyes in my jacket. Then toward the end they reference homosexuality. I don't care what your race, creed, gender, sexual preference etc. etc is but don't put that kind of junk in a kids movie..
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I found this book to be fairly unsatisfying. While it was well written I didn't seem to leave it feeling any differently. The whole time I was waiting for a significant story . But it was just a diary stopped.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is fun and very addictive for both me and my 6 yr old son. I like that he can skip levels that are too hard for him.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Not bad, still leaves option for another movie.  Never followed the videao game but seems liek there shoud be an end soon.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The whole series was great. If you watch the show you should read the books. My only problem is where George left me with book 5. Please finish the series soon. I have a lot of questions about numerous characters...where is you know who...what happened to ?..is blank dead or alive? Why did they stab him? Are you going to execute that biatch soon? So much going on...need answers asap!
B006X5L6VS|1.0|this app. sucks.  I want my money back.<br />I wanted one that you just point at the sky and the objects appear with their names. this is mot the one for that.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I picked this game for my 5 year old to play on the kindle fire. After about 30 minutes of getting familiar with the game, she thinks its great.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Ok story,The Grey wasn't what I thought it would be,disapointed.  I usually really like  Liam Neesom films. Kept waiting for something to happen.  Enough depressing things in the world, don't need to watch a movie that is depressing too!
B0016OMFNY|4.0|I bought this as a gift and they loved it. I don't know the music but based on their reaction, it's great!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am a avid book reader and when I heard of this book i thought it was just like most adult romance books, it just had random sex in it. However, this book had a very good plot line and pulls the reader in!
B001NPJGL0|4.0|Ya its a little small and a tad flimsy feeling but for the price it rocks! It works super. My only concern is if I drop it I think the plastic will crack...its that kind of brittle hard plastic. Other than that its a nice tool. The buttons and readout work very well. And because it was inexpensive I use this thing everywhere.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was not as good as the first one, it took me a little longer to get through it. Still love the characters to had to finish it!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I enjoyed this book for his mix of mystery, history and romance. The book is well written with a story line that keeps you reading.
B001EN71CW|5.0|The series arrived quickly and at a great price. My husband and I have loved the series. Truly a great buy!!
B001EC3JME|4.0|I ordered this for a Maglite XL  only because the Maglite XL holster is no longer being sold.  Too bad.<br />This is a little big for this size flashlight and it doesn't fit as securely as id like. but it is made well and it would be ideal for a slightly larger light.  I may just use it with my larger flashlights. ultra handy and excellent price.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|What started as something disjointed and oddly paced quickly became a masterwork thriller. Unbelievable occurrences coalesce into an amazing book that fittingly and satisfactorily concluded the Esterhazy trilogy. Well done and so worth a read. Now to wait for Special Agent Pendergast's next adventure. Here's hoping we don't have to wait too long.
B009FB3W3W|5.0|Unlike many modern vinyl releases, this release sounds very clear with practically no digital compression. Tracking is silent as well. Overall, A fantastic album on a fantastic format in fantastic quality. What more could you ask for?
B00622B3MY|1.0|This movie should come with a warning label especially as the original \\"Cars\\" was actually a G movie.  This has an enhanced interrogation to death scene.  Lots of guns shooting, death rays, a bomb and killing (is the fate of the cars hit with the same death ray used to murder the spy ambiguous?).  Loads of violence, but little charm or character development.  If the characters were the same and Disney didn't keep the Pixar label, then you'd never suspect it had any relation to the original cars movie.  After \\"Cars\\" I let my 4 yr. old see \\"Cars 2\\" without first screening it - huge mistake.
B000002UB2|5.0|What can I say - its the Beatles, its Abbey Road, Its Vinyl.  It should be self explanatory.  Enjoy the ride
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|It amazes me how well it really works on a tablet. I wasn't expecting Photoshop, that's not why I got a tablet. But for quick fun finger painting type of artwork, it's just amazing.
B0073U2F12|4.0|I really like this movie. I thought the concept was imaginative. I can't wait until part two comes out. I especially liked the aliens but could not understand how they fit in such a small vehicle.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is one of the best written and most original games I've ever seen on a mobile device. Bravo! I can only say that it is a necessary addiction (pun intended) to your mobile game collection. The game plays like a work of art. The last time I have seen a game this artful and beautiful was Okami for the PS2 (still the best console ever made and until you've played Dragon Quest 8, Final Fantasy X or Shadow of the Colossus or even Devil May Cry (any of them) and Silent Hill (1 and 2 especially), the list is ridiculously long for amazing games for that console... in fact I must also mention any of the \\"Tales\\" series of Japanese RPGs, or any Japanese RPGs for that matter ... then don't argue with me lol). Nothing on mobile can touch the PS2, yet. However, this game plays very much like a PS2 game, it has that originality and fun factor that was and still is so dominant on that console and that's why this game so amazing. I cannot recommend it enough. It really is epic and it really is genius.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I really did enjoy this film. What a great cast, although I don't feel that all were used as well as they could have been. Example- Frances McDormand just needed more to work with. Edward Norton was outstanding as the tense and challenged scout leader. I have never been overly impressed by Norton, but he nailed it with this movie role.<br /><br />The storyline of the movie is amusing, fast moving, sweet, nostalgic, and filled with great sense of the period. It is not hollywood style with the typical unrealistic stretch of sensibility. It tells a story and it tells it well.<br /><br />I would enjoy watching this movie again! I am still chuckling from it!
B007FJFDXS|5.0|4 stars for the game alone but the company itself raises this to a 5 star review and I'll explain why please keep reading.<br /><br />Please correct me if I'm wrong because I cannot find the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the finger swiping to move the cube. I much prefer to use the swipe, not virtual stick (man I hate those) it makes the game more funfor me, but the sensitivity of it is way off and I would like to be able to adjust it. Allow us to do that and this game becomes 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Then, add plug-in joystick support for Android Honeycomb and above (support which is built into the operating system), please? Let me plug in my PS2 controller or my wired xbox controller into my tablet and you got yourself 5 stars all the way. I can already do it with lots of other games and it works really really really well. Allow me to do it with this game and I will love it and rave about it and tell everyone I know about it. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />The game is great it just needs some minor work on the controls.<br /><br />I also got other versions through Humble Bundle and that is another thing that is really awesome and I am grateful that you guys participate in that because it helps charity. Hmmm... You know what? Because of that I'm going to go ahead and give this review 5 stars instead of 4 but it really is my hope that you will read this review and think about what I'm saying.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|If you read this before seeing Les Mis on stage or in the recently released movie, it will be a much richer experience. Already watched the movie? Read it anyway. Same story, but so rich in detail of the characters and their circumstance, complemented by the history surrounding it. This is not a book to race through, so if you are in a hurry, you will be frustrated. It is thought provoking and philosophical as well as an expertly written book. It is all that and written in a beautiful way way not seen today. Like a fine wine, it needs to be savored slowly and deliciously.<br /><br />As many books as I have read, I never managed to read Les Miserables until now. I was too busy, too involved in other things. But, if you have the opportunity, seize it! You will be well rewarded by a literary experience of the best kind. I read with my Merriam-Webster app on my iPhone at the ready for those words that have fallen out of use over the ages. I will whip out some of those recovered vocabulary items to amaze and befuddle my friends. Touche'!
B005U9REU0|1.0|I remember enjoying Labyrinth as a preteen and thinking it had some mystical charm. Watching it again as a 42 year old proved to be the longest, most ludicrous, incoherent waste of 80 minutes I wish I had back. It's just awful.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|It was very interesting, and, of course, with this outstanding cast, well acted. But, something seemed to be missing. It wasn't the acting, I can tell you that. It was uneven - passages were enthalling only to stall out later. Some scenes and turns in the story seemed rushed. Yet, others were very satisfying. It is funny, poignant, interesting in its colorful setting (although it seemed limited in the variety of locations). But, there are some sad moments, too. All in all, it is a little like real life - a -mixed bag. Be forewarned,there are emotional issues of aging, financial stress, and death.<br /><br />Watching it with the knowledge that it isn't a perfect movie allows it to be an entertaining and worthwhile movie. I would watch it again.
B0001US62I|5.0|Saw this controversial film when it first came out and to watch it again 25+ years later ... it's still riveting. With Alan Parker directing talent like Rourke, DeNiro, Bonet, etc., mix in the supernatural, voo-doo, and consummate evil and set it in New Orleans ... well, how could it miss??!! Glad to have it in my collection.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|While it is always a pleasure to watch Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones do what they do best, Hope Springs disappoints. Meryl, as usual, disappears into character- always amazing. TL Jones was very good, nice to see in a more restrained role. But, the screenplay does not deliver. It is predictable and bland. Save your money for some of Streep's and Jones' better venues
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Takes all the Beatles #1 hits and puts this on one CD. Who could ask for more?? I especially enjoy singing along with it whenever I'm traveling or even just running errands around town. Wonderful music!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I give this dictionary 1 star because it didn't have the word I was looking for!!!And the word I was looking for was the word only I could pronounce!!!
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Given as part of a birthday gift for a true Jaws fan. He was thrilled to receive it and now hosts Jaws film nights.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|When I was younger I used to watch my grandma play FarmVille and now I can play it......WITH MY LITTLE PONY!I absolutely love the game even though I'm only on level 12....but still my leveling up stuff sucks except on Skylanders.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|The best DVD/CD of the year, in my estimation. Excellent compositions, a stunningly good band, and brilliant playing all around.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have now found one of my all time favorite books. Colleen Hoover is an amazing storyteller, her written words feel so real that they fly off the page and bring you into the book. All I can really say is wow wow wow. I have read her other books and so loved them too, but this one really blew me away. I laughed and cried and held my breath and said OH S*** so many times during the reading of this book.<br />I read a lot and after a bit,I seem to forget the ones I read, but this one will stay with me like like all the words to all the songs in my favorite movie Grease.<br />When you read this book have time, because you will not put it down and make sure you have a box of tissue near by.<br />Enjoy!!
B009SSGBOE|5.0|The next best thing to a new Steely Dan album. As usual, the compositions, playing, and production are perfect. Funky, too!
B009JBWOU0|4.0|Arrived on time. After viewing the Dark Knight movie, the 23 yr. old , and the 51 yr. old males did not like the movie.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Storyline was interesting, puzzles were good, hidden objects portion was fairly easy. I thought that the graphics were very good, and weren't too \\"cartoony\\" like most games of this type. All-in-all, I enjoyed the game, I just wish that it was a little more challenging.
B0032Y0OH0|5.0|great work. it works on time every thing good does what it says good price good for a gift<br />easy install
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My 4 year old had managed to win all the trophies, had a ton of coins and prizes, a high multiplier, and so on. She loves this game and plays daily. She got on it yesterday and all her accomplishments were gone. She really cried. She had no more of the characters she had earned and she worked hard to get all of them. You guys really need to fix this resetting problem.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book, excellently written.  Hazel reminds me a little of Juno, kind of a wise-ass, she had me chuckling a few times despite thd subject mattter.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I used it on my 16g Nexus 7.  It's perfect since I need more space on my tablet. I highly recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I have a. Problem with the plan will nôt work so I won't give this a very rating<br />Would like to know how to fix this
B0027MJU00|5.0|So this book was definitely a good read! Gillian Flynn does it again with Dark Places.. it lagged a little in the beginning but as always Flynn grabs you. I love that I can never get the right story as to what is going to happen. Thumbs up for not being predictable.
B007P6VM04|4.0|Love the show and the music in the show, so very glad to have a copy of the cd. Love the music!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|The color and sturdiness of this Kindle Fire cover make me even happier to use my Kindle.  I like that I can prop the Kindle up in landscape mode if I don't feel like holding it.<br />The cover protects the screen, with easy access.<br />Months later:  I still love my Kindle cover.  It would be nice to be able to prop it up in portrait mode, but I realize that it's one or the other and accept that.  A good item.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a very good book the ending was pretty  ideal in this situation but I think other people would love to see what's in store for katniss
B007UXT6T6|2.0|loved first and third in this series, this one not so much. predictable and ridiculous at times. humor attempts were just that, attempts, and the plot was disjointed. Forgettable.
B009KHCLIS|5.0|I've watched the entire series in order up to Season Seven on NetFlix, and am now watching Season Eight on here... I honestly can't live without it. These characters feel like- no- they are part of my life now. This show always cheers me up, and occasionally leaves me feeling down, but it's always that weak, happy kind of sadness. It's hard to describe. Suffice to say, I love the show, and I don't know what I'll do when it ends.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Pudding Monsters is super fun. It's really adorable and kind of addicting! There are 3 sets of about 24 levels, each set  with its own cute theme. This game, while being entertaining and fun, challenges your brain in cool ways! Updates are said to be coming soon! Get this app!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Filthy, yet intriguing.  Shame on me, but I will read the next two.  This book tells story of innocent woman loving her \\"Dom\\".
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have this app on my kindle fire.  When you start scrolling down the news feed, it doesn't load very many past posts.  The font gets abnormal and then it will no longer allow me to scroll down any more.  I would end up just using the web browser to view fb on my kindle instead.<br /><br />I uninstalled the app.
B009SBSQOO|5.0|If you are a Pablo Alborán fan, I think you will love this album. The songs are great and he is a fantastic singer. Well done!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Tap, tap and the music videos appeared in my Kindle.  It was fast and easy, with no glitches.  I have only used it twice, but feel like an expert.
1401922732|5.0|This cards are so meaningful l!!!...<br />I absolutely love them!! A must have!!!! &#60;3<br />You will never regret getting them,
B0063IH60K|4.0|Well built app. Works great with a few options. Lots of fun, plus it's free! I recommend this to any solitare fan.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|You all not only make it so very simple to watch a movie, but also very lucrative.  I saved almost $5 by watching it through Amazon rather than AT&T.  You all rock!
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|I am an adult and love the ice age movies!  Great for kids!  Highly entertaining and would recommend to all.
1419705849|3.0|This book was kind of not as funny as I expected it to be. As I got to the end in this book, it just wasn't very funny anymore.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book grabbed me from the start and I couldn't put it down.  It was very graphic and violent, but in a natural, circle of life way.
B000059QYB|5.0|Billy idol made great music. He was a rocker in the 1980's and 1990's. This album has all his big hits.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The beginning seems unrealistic but crazier things have happened in Vegas. Short, sweet, and cute love story. You hope for it to work out differently than they planned and the whole time I found myself screaming for them to both open their eyes and look at what was in front of them.<br /><br />Over all very good book in my opinion. I love a book that I can get through in a day. It wasn't really a short story but depending on how fast you read, it was a great quick read.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Being a film maker myself, I can not praise Django Unchained enough. A book could be written on every element I loved about this movie and why I loved it. The acting is award worthy across the board. The music is beautiful, clever, and odd (in a very good way). However I must worn the faint of heart, Quentin Tarantino is an artist and his favorite medium is gore. So if your not down with blood, be warned. However blood and gore are not his only specialties. Quentin Tarantino certainly stretches his dialogue muscles throughout the entire film. Each scene is filled to the brim with an expansive and cleverly used vocabulary. The director and actors have also managed to keep a perfect balance between the gruesome and scarring history behind slavery and an extremely new and hilarious take on the dark time period. The film truly hits you hard with rough images, but repays you with an extraordinary sense of well timed humor. And if the movie doesn't repay in comedy, it repays with some of the most awesome, intense, kick-ass, and gruesome shoot outs you've ever experienced. I've watched the movie twice now and the three HUGE shoot outs in the film never cease to get me all pumped up. It's almost impossible to not stand up in your seat fist pumping and yelling, \\"Get those white guys!\\" and I'm caucasian myself. There is so much more to be said, however I will leave you to experience the rest. This is every film aficionado's dream. If you love an Oscar worthy film that makes you feel like a cheering football super fan every time a gun is on screen, this is your movie. I also strongly recommend checking out Quentin Tarantino's other work. It's all outstanding if not better than Django Unchained. I honestly hope you enjoy the film and fall in love like I have.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|World Of Goo is an interesting puzzle based game. I've played it previously on a console and it handles just as well on the DROID operating system. Highly Recommend
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game my brother has it on ipad and he let me play that is when I became addicted when it came out on kindle I immediently down loaded it. I reccomend this game to anybody.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started off slow then I couldn't put it down. Not real crazy about the end - wish something would have happened to Amy - something bad!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Lana's music is a wonderful mix of dirty and elegant. Soft, bluesy vocals capture the sophisticated side of your heart while the occasional dirty line plays to the little bit of naughty in all of us. It's hard to classify her sound but if you like it you'll be listening to her songs on repeat.
B000B589JI|1.0|The canister leaks big time.  Whatever the canister is attached to becomes a torch by way of the lighter fluid leaking out of the canister and on to whatever.
1419707663|4.0|I bought these for my grandson for Christmas hoping to read with him.  He took them home.  First time he took a book home!  Must be really good.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like it but they could have made it a little more harder. I mean you just kind of move around a little line
B005C9YZIM|5.0|I bought this dvd set as a gift on Amazon after looking around at local stores.  Not only was this price the best, it was also the only place that I could find the 6-disc special edition set! It turned out to be a great holiday gift! Thank you Amazon!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This movie is a retelling of the John Steinbeck book, telling the hardships of people who have lost everything and are trying to survive. A reminder for those of us who do not know what the United States was like before govenment programs to assist those who are in greatest need.
1926778537|5.0|Darksiders is back with another great game and equally great accompanying art. The Art of Darksiders 2 is divided into Key Visuals (Artwork), Characters & Enemies, Weapons, Locations, CG models, Storyboards, some commentary on art development, and Key Visuals (CG). It's a bit thinner than the first book, but the binding has improved (thank God). In my opinion, the layout is more organized and even. The first artbook was more scattered and left blank space between the small thumbnails.<br /><br />Despite this, I highly recommend both artbooks if you love the game or video game art in general. There are lots of wickedly good drawings on every page. I'm very pleased with the quality and quantity. :)
034537410X|4.0|fantastic guide book. summarizing many different techniques in logical order to learn how to induce lucid dreams. i only wish some chapters had more scientific or at least theoretical explanations of why certain techniques are supposed to be helpful, maybe a little more content about the science of lucid dreams. otherwise, great book, well written, helpful.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is fun and addictive!  My nieces love it, and so do I.  It makes you think and is definitely a fun twist on an already popular game!
B000AM6MKU|5.0|very good product, very cut train and good dvd. I've receive it quickly. it's a good gift for kid and
B000OXHRRC|5.0|What a Great, feel-good story. Made me want to move to southern France...<br />A realistic, fun, modern-day love story.<br />- I recommend to all...
1936719118|5.0|I bought 10 copies to give to board and committee members of my organization. Only takes about an hour to read. Makes many really great points about what to consider when reevaluating how and why you are doing what you do.
1599290634|4.0|I've been buying this series every Christmas for my husband, so it was nice to find what he wanted once again. My only concern is that in the past the books have been shrink wrapped and this year it wasn't. It appears to be new, just not pristine.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was the best diary of wimpy kid book I ever read in  my life I'm gonna read so many times
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I discovered Rodriguez on a piece 60 Minutes did on him recently. Afterward I googled and Amazon'd him, found the album and bought it. Amazing singer/songwriter. I would recommend this album (and have) to any music lover. I actually enjoy the reaction other people have when &#34;they&#34; discover Rodriguez for the first time.
B003INBOEM|5.0|Great dam movie!  I have now watched all three Ip Man movies and cannot get enough.  Would recommend to any kung fu fan.
B007FRHZ4A|2.0|As most of the reviews have noted, the building blocks included in this game are nearly impossible to use in creating most of the cards.  We got so fed up and found some \\"jenga\\" blocks to use in place of the longer pieces.  It is not an exact match but with a little improvisions it works pretty well.  And it is actually a really fun game now that we can construct the buildings on the cards.  I actually called the company to notify them of our frustrations.  It makes me wonder if they even tested this before producing this one. Hopefully they will revise this and go back to the original building blocks.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|For some reason I just picked this out of the air to read.  Now that I've read on of the Jack Reachers Novels I am going to read them all.  Of course it helps to know that a movie is coming out about him.
B005LAII12|5.0|My husband really wanted this movies for christmas and thanks to you I was able to have it wrapped on christmas morning.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again Vince Flynn keeps you involved - I have been reading him ever since he began this series and he never disappoints.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Very easy to use and gives all the information you need to choose a wifi link. Actually it gives more information than I totally understand (for you hard core geeks out there) but the basics are first up and easy to interpret (graphs and a meter).
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|As long as you consider that a talking teddy bear is the supporting actor and it's rated R it's a fun movie.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Always wonderful to read a classic!<br />I never tire if reading this book, movies are great, book is always better.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This was an awesome film for fans of the Halo video game franchise.  Acting was so so, and cgi could have been better in a couple spots but for a under the table halo movie it's highly recommended.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|JACK REACHER<br />Tom Cruise, Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins, and others, including Werner Herzog and Robert Duvall<br /><br />I saw Jack Reacher this weekend. I went mostly out of curiosity:  I've read every Reacher novel written by Lee Child (some of them bought through Amazon) and loved them.<br /><br />I knew Child's Reacher and Cruise's would be different animals. Child's Reacher is 6' 5\\", between 210 and 250 pounds in different books, and has a 50\\" chest. Cruise is 5' 7\\" and probably weighs, stripped down, between 140 and 150 pounds. Even as fighters (which is one of the things Jack Reacher has to do every so often), they'd fight differently -radically differently--because there's no way a 150 pound, 5' 7\\" tall man could do some of the things an oversized behemoth like the original Reacher does. And though neat, like an ex-military man would be, Lee Child's Reacher is always a little scruffy: he buys his clothes one set at a time, throwing away the old ones, because he doesn't like to travel encumbered, and until then, he washes them out in the sink of whatever motel room he's staying in. Tom Cruise's Reacher exhibits the same behavior as Child's Reacher in this regard, but Cruise's Reacher always looks neat, just as Tom Cruise does himself.<br /><br />Enough carping on appearance. The critical question is how well does Cruise do as Reacher, and the answer is `okay.' Not great, not even near it, but okay, not a total embarrassment.<br /><br />Nor is the movie a total embarrassment. There is a good fight near the beginning when five local thugs take on Reacher to teach him a lesson. It's kind of comical watching little Tom Cruise mouth some of Reacher's words about how this is their last chance to get off without damage and how five to one odds are really three to one odds, because the last two will run away when they see what Reacher does to the first three, but the fight itself is swift, brutal, and most essential in a Reacher story, efficient. There is no waste effort, and avoiding waste effort is essential to the Reacher persona: he doesn't indulge in histrionics, he always uses the most direct efficient and quickest way to success in combat, like a good soldier would.<br /><br />What a shame then there's a second big fight because the movie butchers it. Reacher has come to the showdown against the bad guys. He's already warned one -a Russian sniper- that if he sees him again, he's going to hand him his lunch barehanded. So what happens? He gets the drop on the bad guy and is pointing an assault rifle right at his chest at close to zero range.  So Reacher/Cruise throws away his gun and rakes on the baddie mano a mano, in one of those generic fights we've seen in hundreds of other movies. There's also a car chase -what action movie would be complete without one?--that is boringly generic. We've seen it all too many times for it to be exciting except in the most mechanical, evanescent way.<br /><br />That's a problem with the whole movie. It's a generic action film. Some of Reacher's tics have been inserted -he doesn't talk a lot, he washes his clothes out in the sink and buys new ones and throws away the old ones when he's done with them, he has near eidetic memory, and most of the time you just know he's been in army for years by the way he acts--but behind it all, eliminate the tics and this could just as easily be Ethan Hawke, sans disguises and trickery, in any of the increasingly boring Mission Impossible movies that have kept Cruise a star.<br /><br />What's best in the movie? Old pros Werner Herzog and Robert Duvall milk their roles for all they are worthy and succeed in making them believable and enjoyable to watch.  Richard Jenkins does a good, not great job, as Good Lawyer Rosamund Pike's father (he's the D.A.).<br /><br />The Lee Childs novel that this movie was taken from (One Shot) was crisply plotted and everything Reacher does in it is thought out and efficient. This movie is just messy. Not horrible butnot good either. Thus okay, no better than that.<br /><br />One other complaint: Cruise is starting to look old for this kind of movie. His body is still buff, but, as it was in the last Mission Impossible movie when he was on the outside of the Burj al Khalifa in Dubai with his shirt off, his muscles look like old muscles now, and his face is puffy in closeups. Cruise has shown in previous movies that he's a modestly competent actor. He needs to begin stretching himself before he winds up playing opposite Sly, Arnold, Bruce and Jean Claude in one of those retread Old Heroes movies.<br /><br />Lee Child says he likes Cruise as Reacher, but then Lee Child sold Cruise's production company the character franchise for the movies and I doubt he did it purely out of a conviction that Cruise was the perfect Reacher. Besides, Child used to work in advertising and we all know ad men occasionally bend the truth.not good either.

B0087YYHZU|4.0|excellent Bluraying of such an old wonderful movie. Good pictures and fine sound..Better than old video or DVD copies. makes a new look of an old movie so good!
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run the best game that I ever played and I play it everyday with bro and sis and we have a good time
B009OYSFDM|5.0|good story line, I never followed the comic so it was all new to me and I wasn't biased one way or another. Great fight scenes where the hero (almost) always wins...<br /><br />it's got my vote.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Amazing book I like this better than the hunger games. It was the best book I've read because the maze runner
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Yet again another brilliant book by Colleen Hoover. I am so blown away by her books it's unreal. I hope she has lots more books to be released soon!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book!!! I could not put it down. Can not wait to read the next book. I would get it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's interesting to watch how this household adjust from vintage to modern times.  I love the attempts of power plays by the various character for their individual reasons.  I have not seen &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34;, however I enjoy that the two &#34;families&#34; periodically overlap.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Informative and interesting.  Liked the deep background and association with Jobs.  Clearly he was an innovative genius with a passion, more than a passion for details.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I really love it. I can fit all the cables in it, barely. The next version needs a bigger screen.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I got this app for my kindle fire and when I don't have anything to do, I play it and so far I haven't had any problems. I love it!

B00AMBH70S|3.0|it was ok. kinda slow. the jason bourne ones were better, minimum words requirement on this is stupid. you're welcome
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie, It was so funny and cant wait to see It again and show all my friends. But to much of the h word=hell.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|shouldn't the stars be enough. do these s****y comments actually help with anything. its a funny movie i gave it 4 stars stop sending s****y emails asking me to rate it.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The best recording of Les Miserables is in my humble opinion: [[ASIN:B0027P2ZWC Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert]].  Simply amazing talent and a great recording.  The original Broadway recording suffers from terrible audio (I think only a few principals were miked, and then they probably had mikes at the front of the stage for the rest; even in songs featuring two or three singers, one sounds far away - in a few songs it's almost to faint to be heard).  But both of these are complete recordings.  I have the 25th Anniversary on order, so I will compare that as well.<br /><br />There are 20 songs and they range from about a minute or so up to the amazing 6 minute epilogue.  Highlights (personally) are Hathaway's 'I Dreamed a Dream', Barks' 'On My Own', and the entire casts' version of 'One Day More'.  There are also some of the funnier songs included, those sung by Cohen and Bonham Carter.<br /><br />The songs are the actual songs from the film, nothing is a re-recorded version.  So yes, in 'I Dreamed a Dream' you get the Hathaway choking up at times.  I respect her version all the more because so many on the stage love to just belt that one out, yet Hathaway puts a lot of emotion into it.  Neither way is better really.  I like it both ways.<br /><br />I purchased the mp3 album for $5 as part of a special deal Amazon offered.  Well worth every penny.  It's not complete, it's not the best, but it's a great album and well worth owning if you liked the movie.  And seriously Russel Crowe, good effort, but Hugh Jackman owned it.  But this selection of highlights only captures a whisper of the magic of seeing the film.  I recommend picking this up if you have seen the movie and enjoyed it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|sad to see it end but what a ride ups downs love sex relationships, compromise,hard to put into words  read it!!!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is an awesome time management game. If you played any of the diner dash games you will enjoy cooking dash. I am so happy I can play on my kindle fire. Like I said this game is awesome.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Lots of twists and turns. Found myself crying at times and laughing out loud at others. Very interesting glimpse into one of Ireland's shameful practices.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|love this series a real inspiration for mature married women, married over 26 yrs,great read would recommend highly!!!! great book
0316227706|4.0|This book is full of great photography of my favorite subject! The only thing that would have made it better is to include a Boxer.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Use every day multiple times a day.  Easy access to email and makes for ongoing updates.  Great relief from the iPhone.
B0020M99LC|5.0|The more I watch Daniel Craig as Bond, the more I really and truly LOVE this guy. I am old school Sean Conneryesque about this character and hated some of the replacements as being just not Bond ENOUGH. Craig is all that and something different. He doesn't have that smooth quality, he is more feral... more dangerous and yet just as irresistible. It just keeps getting better each time. Seeing Bond actually in love, and his bitterness afterwards makes you see the man behind the gun, and how they carry it over from this movie to the next... and then the next... never leaving that raw experience behind, is perfection.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We received this DVD on time and in perfect condition.  We've all thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Being from Ireland, we love the scenery of Scotland and their accents...hard to believe it's animated!!  I would recommend this DVD to our friends. Thank you!
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Daniel Craig brings his own twist to James Bond, and the look into how 007 started out, along with the merest glimpse of a soft white underbelly, makes the character all Craig's own from this point on. It's darker, more feral, and yet more vulnerable all at the same time. Superb choice in the new Bond, and a delightfully twisted plot!
B005HV6Y84|5.0|My girl love this movie, as she paid for it. She have view this movie over 20 times<br />from the time it arrived. I think she is possed over this movie. I like the movie very much, but not viewing it once a week as she does.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I gave this advent calendar to my friends 9 year old boy and he loved it!  Each time I came to visit he showed me all the new pieces with a lot of enthusiasm.  Perfect gift :)
0689815816|5.0|Nice little book.  Very popular in preschool and among the deaf community due to its repetition.  My grandson loves it.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I I I I I have to figure out how to pull it up, and listen to it : (
0307383415|5.0|Haven't read it yet, but the book was in good condition.  I'm sure it will be a great collector's item some day.  Might explain why our nation is in the poor condition it is today.
B008AT71WI|4.0|I've been a fan of the \\"theatrical version\\" for as long as I can remember.  When I saw the Director's Cut available on Amazon, I ordered it right away.  I just got done watching the Director's Cut version and I am stunned by what I saw.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />During the last 10 minutes of the film, the movie goes from being a humorous musical to a bunch of killer plants destroying the world.  It's easy to see why they changed the ending for the final version.  The end of the Director's Cut is a complete joke and ruins the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I understand that Frank Oz is a puppeteer and so surely he has a slight bias towards puppets, so it's understandable why he would want to see them take over the planet.  But that's no way to write a movie.<br /><br />Not to mention killing off Seymour and Audrey.  The hero ALWAYS survives.  That's movie 101.  I thought everyone knew that.<br /><br />Overall, I give this blu-ray 4 stars because it still has the better theatrical version so at least I have a choice of which one to watch.
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|I really like all the Halo games and have wanted to see a movie like this for a long time.
B003YCIE68|5.0|We had this movie on a vcr tape, but wanted to watch it again.  Not sure if we could find it, I went to Amazon.com to do a search.  Lo and behold, it was available on a CD in HD.  Ordered it in time to watch again before Christmas this year.  The whole family will love this movie.  It's wonderful.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|A classic album made better with all the extras and never before love concerts a must for any rage fan
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I got this for free when it was the free app of the day and it is now my favorite game app. I'd buy it at full price for sure
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is great to have so many options to play!  The games are great, some are easier than others so you get a good assortment.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started this book, I thought it would just be another sappy, predictable romance novel. But shortly into the book Hoover kept my attention by foreshadowing that it wasn't going to be your typical fairy tale because that doesn't happen to real people in real life (something that frequently angers me with books and movies - so predictable!). Halfway through the book, I couldn't put it down until I was finished with it. Hoover touches on difficult and touchy subjects with the appropriate style. The way she portrays the issues, as well as the emotional connections between characters, is real and is to be commended. This book is a wonderful read, and is highly recommended for readers young and old.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Very cute and adorable.  Very clean for a Harlequin book of this nature.<br />Positively Romatic and what every girl dreams of.
030758836X|5.0|I ordered this book because it was one of the top sellers and I was between books. I was not dissapointed. This book got me hooked fast and is an easy read the whole way through.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so addicting.I love it.my friend had it on her phone and had me play it.it is kinda like temple run.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband but after listening, want it for myself. These guys have an amazing sound. every song is good.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Gregg sounds great, better than ever really. T Bone put an old school mix to it that can take you back 80 years. It sounds like a classic and takes the greatest blues singer of our time maybe ever to a level of a Ray Charles and wil stamp Greggs place in music as high as anyone. I live in the Low Country and this really gets the Swamp Water running thru my veins.The best solo work of his life. Its a 12 out of 10
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three books in 5 days i loved these books and i wish they would do another one. i found it awesome at the end that el james went from christians perspective i hope they bring back a fourth book all in christians view or how there life is now with two kids. i just can't explain how much i enjoyed these books i couldn't put them down. i loved everything from christians sweet romantic gestures to there adorable emails back and fourth to one another and their desire and passion and love for one another. these are beautifully written books and you wont be disappointed. Laters Baby :)
B00723NWJE|5.0|Outstanding work as always from Ms Jones. She moved in a differnt direction just like The Fall and does a fantastic job of hagging it all out over the line.She is such a great musican and could sing the phone book and make it sound great.<br /><br />Norah will you marry me ?
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This is how the film should have been at the theatre; it doesn't make sense in the shortened original version.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun puzzles and a good story. not too hard, not too easy. will get more games from developer. graphics were awesome on the cut scenes.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very addictive game and very fun every day I end up playing for at least two or more hours at a time over all nice game
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Sly had a great idea when he decided to do this project. Putting action stars together before they became to old was great. Most of the time when you get a lot of big name actors together, the movie is usually not that great. But the Expendables was worth the money.<br />  This movie is fun to watch. Graphic at times, but funny most of the time. The Old Guys seem to just have fun.<br /><br />  Enjoy.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Loved it but has.  Couple of language/sexual problems. And talks about a lot of nude things. But otherwise great book!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put this down best<br />So gripping<br />Heart wrenching I learn so much about the characters<br />You feel the emotions and intense through it all like y poo u were really their to
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game kept me interested enough to want to continue on after the free version expired.  All in all it was entertaining and kept me busy for a few hours.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I really enjoy the series.  It's a good story with interesting characters that you can't get enough of.  I definitely recommend this series to anyone that just enjoys good reading.
B004EPZ02A|1.0|Supposedly filmed with home movie equipment in 1988, all the scenes are in wide screen format. I'd say that ruins the whole premise starting with the very first frame. \\"A new level of terror\\" is the hype on the cover of the movie. If it is a new level, it is a new LOW level - this film did not have even a moment of \\"terror\\". On the back, of the cover is more hype: \\"the last 15 minutes will mess you up for life.\\" Seriously? I confess, this movie was given to me. I didn't pay a dime for it. Yet, somehow I still feel ripped off! I did invest an hour and a half of my life in watching it, and I want my time back. Watching a C-Span session of congress will provide much more terror than this poor excuse for a movie. It is another haunted house movie, with nothing new, nothing original, nothing interesting and nothing the least bit frightening. The most frightening thing about this movie is that someone profited off of it - there is some real terror for you. This is the second movie review I have written in my 54 years of life. I love movies - I can't get enough of them. The fact that I am sitting here writing this is proof positive that this is up there with the worst movies ever made. Do yourself a favor - do anything else for an hour and a half, other than watching this horrific excuse for a movie. I am actually angry. I thought that at some point, something of interest would happen. I feel like a sucker for having seen this. Those who gave this a rating higher than 1 have apparently never seen a decent film before.
0812981448|5.0|I recommend everyone to read this book if you are planning to have your own business in the future. This is a great book to get idea.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a cute book that had me hooked! It was an easy read but fun to read as well. I did not want to put it down. Did not like how it ended, I wish it would have continued!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Really like that there r different levels and 6 different ones to chose from . HE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THE TILES R SO SIMILAR
B004SBQGHS|4.0|It is a fun but frustrating game.  As you move up the ladder to higher levels, the required accuracy of shots also rises.  Without having any type of device, other than your eye, to correct the aiming point from one shot to the next, sometimes requires many re-dos of a level.  It is definitely a challenging, but fun, game
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Gives the reader an excellent feel for what the atmosphere in Europe and England was during World War II with all the tragedies and intrigue involved.
B007L6VR6M|3.0|MOONRISE KINGDOM is the latest, quirky movie by Wes Anderson.  Fans will love the story of childhood love set on a New England island called New Penzance in 1965. Sam and Suzy are 12-year olds who meet one summer. They write throughout the year and make a pact to sneak off together the next summer. Sam abandons his scout troop, and Suzy leaves her parents. The two kids meet up and share an innocent love while the entire island is looking for them.<br /><br />I've enjoyed all the Wes Anderson movies I've watched (only missed one), but I'm not an ardent fan or defender. His casts are always top notch, and this film includes Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, and Edward Norton. Fans of Anderson will find plenty to like in this quirky coming of age story.<br /><br />Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman steal the show as Sam and Suzy, two young kids who are in love. They share adventure, and a first kiss on a beach they call Moonrise Kingdom. I however, wanted to point out that I believe there is a little too much sexuality in the film concerning a 12 year old girl. I don't deny that it is realistic, or that it works in the movie. While on the beach, the two kids go swimming, stripping down to underwear. Suzy's bra shows tons of cleavage, and one shot basically shoots straight down her bra. Also, she asks the little boy to put his hand on her chest. I felt uncomfortable watching scenes on film that are usually depicted by actors at least 18 years of age.<br /><br />I went on Amazon affiliated IMDB to see other viewer's thoughts on this, and anyone who was critical of the sexuality in this movie was called every name in the book. I've never seen so much hate in my life. Fans of Anderson have every right to defend this movie. But as someone who considered watching this movie with my 11 and 9 year old kids, I'm sure glad I didn't. I'm writing this review to give a heads up to parents who may feel the same way I do. People may bash this review too, or think I'm a prude or out of touch. Trust me, I'm not. I enjoy sex and romance in a movie just as much as the next guy, I just don't want to see 12 year olds doing it.review too, or think I'm a prude or out of touch. Trust me, I'm not. I enjoy sex and romance in a movie just as much as the next guy, I just don't want to see 12 year olds doing it.
B0049VZ222|5.0|The best show I have seen in a long time. The story makes you care about everyone. Acting is a little weak in this season, but it gets better.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|not for the kids, that's for sure.....it was fun, entertaining but wow, very profane, again, just for adults who don't easily offend.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this game is awesome its the best slender man game. in the amazon store its not like the crappy. games that you can buy. and its just like the Pc version
B009X01C64|5.0|This case makes me love my Kindle that much more!!!  It fits snug and perfectly, great protection, versatile use, solid construction.  Honestly, it's absolutely perfect!  After much research on-line and searching in stores, this was the right pick!  It does add some bulk if that's an issue for others, for me I love everything about it!!  Highly recommend!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It was actually very unexpected considering everything I had heard about it, there is much more substance and story than I thought there was going to be.
B0091REZMW|4.0|like this game so far. just enough mystery for my type of gaming. thanks to the creator for doing such a good job.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Rosamund's writing is nearly lyrical even when..especially when..describing the daily mundane. Loved the letter to my sister aspect. The author genuinely captures the emotional bedrock of sisters and their older/younger dance through life. The mystery was tight and compelling, and the twist uncovered at the right moment in the book. You don't have to be a sister to read this beauty, but if you are be warned that you will feel sorely compelled to hug yours once you are finished the book.
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|I paid for this app and it was taken from my bank acct.  However I never got the app itself. First time that has ever happened.
B003ZDZ1WG|3.0|The only song I really like is &#34;If I Die Young&#34;. I didn't really like the others that much, I guess the beats just didn't catch me very well.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend and his brother. They are obsessed with this show. I like it, but apparently not nearly as much as they do, so I got the first two seasons as a little suprise for them. They freaked out. They were very excited.<br />This was a great price. The product arrived in great condition and very quickly. I am very happy with it.
B00355L2TU|3.0|First of all, let me say that this is a good, sound workout.  If you're looking for something relatively short that will get your heart rate up and works most of your muscles this is a fine program.  You could do a lot worse.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with the whole thing is the &#34;20 pounds in 30 days claim&#34;.<br /><br />I'm a 300 pound guy.  Out of shape yes, obese no.  I can still run a 30 minute 5k at my weight.  I burn about 300 calories doing this work out.  A pound of fat takes 3500 calories to burn off.  If I DIDN'T EAT FOR A MONTH I wouldn't lose 30 in a month, whether I did this program or not.  If you think you can get a 3500 calorie a day caloric deficit go for it.  But you can't.  Most people will burn about 200 calories doing this program, on top of a base rate of about 2000.  If you cut to a 1500 calorie a day diet you can expect to lose about 8 pounds in 30 days.<br /><br />Don't let the outrageous claim turn you off, it's still a good program.  Just understand that it's impossible to lose 20 pounds in 30 days without going on a hunger strike.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Found a lot of characters to keep up with, but enjoyed the read as with most of his books, will read again
B000FC10WU|5.0|I've read most of Agatha Christie's books and I haven't been disappointed with any of them! She is a great author.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|got the book for my 7th grader. The 8th grade read this book last year and they love it and so does my 7th grader. It is a very easy book but very instersing.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I like this movie for several reasons.  The actors were real life people.  The documentary style made me realize it really happened but felt like I was experiencing it on the part of Nev and Angela (the mother) who was really the fictional daughter as well. My favorite part was when she was drawing Nev and they had the conversation of &#34;truth?&#34; and why???  You could see the pain in the eyes of both of them.  Nev surprised me because he did not show anger during that conversation.  He kept it cool with his reactions.  The time he said &#34;I'll be okay&#34; touched me because you know he was hiding his true feelings.  Angela had issues of not completely going after her dance and art dreams of the past.  She found what she needed in the online relationship between her and Nev.  I saw the movie a couple of days ago and as I saw it written somewhere, &#34;it still haunts me.&#34;  No wonder she could not come clean with him on this relationship, could you if the guy looked like Nev?&#34;
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I got this app for my son's kindel and it is great. It reads to you out loud and he loves it!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|It doesn't take a master of deduction to see that Ritchie has decided to play it too safe with this sequel.
0670023329|5.0|This was a hard-to-put-down book. It was gut-wrenching to read but very illuminating about the horrible human rights in North Korea. That this camp and others like it still exists is beyond comprehension. It is especially heartrending to know that children are born into this camp and never get to leave it. No child should have to endure starvation and hard labour and NO joy for the rest of its life. The cruelty of the government in torturing people whose only 'crime' is being born into a certain family is unconscionable. The people are truly at the mercy of an evil, Satanic government.<br /><br />The book also educates the reader on the history of N. and S. Korea and the mindset of this divided population.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|&#34;Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol&#34; is sheer hurtling mechanism-and it's great silly fun. As usual with the series, the movie combines a plot line a toddler could understand with gadgets that would baffle an engineering Ph.D.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Brings back the memories of when I was a kid watching this on tv. Classic movie with classic storyline makes it stand out even in today's sitcom/movie madness.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|The movie was entertaining and was like watching an extended family guy. There was a lot of recreational drug use, some teddy bear sex, so be wary of who you watch the movie with.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this is a very good version love playing it.  would like to see more like it and we would get.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|good story fast paced  a bit too violent for my taste even if it is fantasy  it portrays such a rough world
B000J3EEBY|4.0|There are nine tracks on this album, several of which feature Middle Eastern sounds and the rest of which feature European/Celtic sounds.  To confuse things, McKennitt seeks the roots of Celtic sound through the Middle East and the Silk Road, so tunes that look like they should be Middle Eastern in sound actually have Celtic sounds to them.  Whatever the musical influences in the tunes, they are rich-sounding notes that build up stories in their lyrics and regale the ears through their hypnotic rhythms.<br /><br />There is a little booklet of liner notes included with the CD that lists out the lyrics on the album so you can follow along as McKennitt sings.  Since McKennitt's voice can be quiet at times, this booklet is a real treasure that allowed me to hear the lyrics clearly as she sang.<br /><br />If there is a theme to this collection it is \\"travel.\\" The album bounces around in time and place, visiting a number of exotic locales through its songs.  The unusual sounds of the album richly evoke distant places and lost times, recalling Western Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East.  McKennitt's haunting voice is superb at telling stories through lyrics, and you won't go wrong as you listen in to her tales.
B009H442DG|5.0|this was a gift for my sister who is a huge fan of John and Olivia, and she loved it.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I Couldn't get to the screen to start the game. I just deleted it since I didn't pay for it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was good and valadation all of my sexual most asked questions and then some.  It just went on and on and on.  It left little to the unkown.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love games with lots of levels and mini-games and things to do throughout the game. Great thing about G5 games is that they do just that. Thanks for another great game!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Totally creepy and fun.  Fast paced and keeps you thinking.  Didnt mind having to pay for full version, it was worth it.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|This movie won't disappoint! I liked every minute of it. You will want to watch it over and over again
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Looks big, put it does a great job.  Like the way it feels when I write. Not afraid that it will fall apart looks and feels strong.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is amazing. One of the funniest ive played ina while. The gameplay is amazing. Keeps my attention for hours
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is very fun and it takes awhile to play. It is worth the money for the full version.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|The movie is awesome and would recommend but be aware it has parts that are hard to digest in parts.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I can't wait for the movie coming in February!! The ending really got me. Perfect read on a rainy day!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If I didn't have risotto wouldn't have been able to pull myself away from this book. I couldn't stop but didn't want it to end.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Pi is an intelligent character with an exciting story to tell. I was constantly intrigued by his trials and triumphs. Life of Pi is not for the light hearted, but tells of the intense life-altering journey a 16-year-old is forced to endure. Truly one of the best books I have read lately! I couldn't put it down!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I enjoyed this book. To imagine a world where plastic surgery is the norm.... transforming from normal to model ... but then tally met Shah and her whole life changes. The journey to the smoke and falling in love with David. But then destroying the locket led special circumstances to their camp... the daring rescue and tally turning herself in..... what about the lesions?????? What'll become of tally??? I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
1451638450|4.0|Not up to Bujold's usual standard, but not far off.  Plot transparent and Ivan Vorpatril is no Miles.  Some good ideas especially Microborer.  I would buy anything Bujold will write.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|I purchased this for my Kindle Fire. Nice case, but not an exact fit. The case is a bit big for the Kindle Fire. Once this case needs to be replaced, I will not purchase this one again
B005FISBTO|5.0|Season 6 is one of the best yet.  Many twists and turns as always, but this season did not lag at any point.  Seemed to go by way too quickly.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its so cool I love it its addicting and fun!!!!!! you should sooo get the game so get the game if you just read this ENJOY!!!!! ITS SOO FUN SO GET IT TODAY!
0446554995|5.0|So glad to see another novel with Agent Pendergast.  Many characters from previous books show up here.  A great read.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|We purchased this for our 2-1/2 yr. grandson for Christmas and he loves it! Very good craftsmanship. Only took two people about 2 hrs. to put together and start playing! I would definitely recommend it to others!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game its so fun and it never gets boring and I think it is even better than Mario , and my favorite thing about is that you can throw acorns i would recommend this app
B008I43DYU|5.0|Love it!  This basic and scientific calculator is exactly what I need for simple and more complicated calculations.  Having it on my Kindle Fire HD is great because it goes wherever I go and I never know when I'll need it.  Will try to see if I can download it to my cell phone as well.
B005HSL626|4.0|Grandson loves playing the game.  sound effects are good.  For a free game it's good to pass the time playing
B001CTGQBK|4.0|This is a great movie that takes you back to the 50's.  Great songs,lots of laughs, and good entertainment.  Only gripe,and a small one, is some slight vulgar and unnecessary language of very young viewers.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|So dang funny.  We watched it several times.  We would watch it again if we more than 2 days.  Gett'r dun.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I bought this collection because it has all of Garth's best songs and a bonus is the DVD with videos. This is essential for any Garth Brooks fan.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Cannot wait for the Feb session to get here because we will watch the first episodes to get us ready for it.
B0016BP0PW|1.0|The film was okay until that girl started singing on the football pitch.  Awful nasal singing voice and completely ruined the song.  I quit watching while she was still singing.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|After the first two chapters, the book takes off. You are thrown into the hectic lives of the inhabitants of the Grange and Wuthering Heights. The language is beautiful, and the plot takes you on many twists and turns.
1612185495|4.0|Written in the 50's, this story can seem racist and sexist by today's standards but Bond is a man of goodwill toward good people of any race and/or sex and deadly opposition to evil genius' of any race and sex.  Dr. No thinks that he is a superior human being and destined to be one of the rulers of the world but 007 exposes the flaws in Dr. No's plans and exploits them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing! I never imagined it would end up going where it did, although it is kind of a heart wrenching journey, it is worth it.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|I have been a Jane Austen fan since I first discovered her books in my early teens, many years ago.  I have read other author's versions of life at Pemberley following the marriage of Lizzy and Darcy.  PD James has surpassed them all and I will definitely read this one again.  The bonding of the superb PD James and the sublime Jane Austen was a joy to read and I felt the familiar sadness when I read the last page.  More, please!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Great book! COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!<br /><br />This is a must read book ! It draws you in and the suspense is great!
B004X4R49Y|3.0|Well acted and interesting subject, but not quite sure why all the accolades. It was an easy, enjoyable watch but I won't be watching it again.
B001QWBM62|4.0|Have just finished using this for a couple of weeks on professional audio recordings.<br />It works very well, although it takes a bit of practice to train people to actual make the recordings as the sound check feature can lead them to think they are recording when they are not.
B004WR125O|1.0|I have talked to the Geek folks at BestBuy and to the technical support people at Onkyo.<br />No one knows how to make this thing work.<br />I just use an Apple Airport Express and plug into an audio in on the back of the NR709, sound great.
B004V5A7K8|1.0|I have already deleted this app, not what I thought it would be. not worth your time downloading it to play.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Excellent book. Like a modern age Old Man and the Sea.  The twist is that it explores multiple religions existing together in harmony.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B009DKCBM8|5.0|This Blu Ray adds absolute necessity to any Neil Young fan's home electronics set up. The music is astounding if your system is aimed at audio resolution. MP3 is crap. This album on a good system will blow your mind. The album itself is a tremendous masterwork by the Godfather of Grunge. The guy quit drugs, got his old band Crazy Horse back together, recorded a \\"folk\\" album that ROCKS (Americana), but before touring he insisted on recording brand new music that really hits deep, music that the Grunge Gods in Heaven would be moved to tears by! 80 minutes of sonic bliss. The guy rocks so hard with that guitar of his; the tone is insanely inspired. A jet engine in a hurricane never sounded so good! Even the more basic songs are very good. He does stuff here we have never seen him do before. The epic passages stretch on for over 20 minutes in the case of 2 of them. Ontario is a classic sing-along song which surely came from Neil's mind while writing his new memoir, Waging Heavy Peace. The video which accompanies the blu ray is quite fun to watch as our hero grows up and hangs out with Dad, etc. Twisted Road is a tip of the hat to Dylan and Like a Rolling Stone, and also to Roy Orbison and Sam Cooke. It is another modern classic. Ramada Inn, it is said, may be the best song he has ever written. But there are several more new classics on this 80 minute album and several more that are very good. In fact, the whole darn album is a knockout punch. Just as his recent albums have all been incredibly inspired. Le Noise, oh God, don't get me started. And they are all available on Blu Ray. Just search in Amazon. I won't review the Panasonic BDT-500 here, but it is a hell of a great audio / blurry video player. The experience I had while cranking this album up and watching the cool behind the scenes video shots and amazing visual art (walk like a GIant) was completely moving and powerful. I could feel the sound resonating with my body, filling my soul with a full sound spectrum bymy favorite living recording artist. When the hell is Experience Hendrix going to start releasing jimi's multitude of classic albums on Blu Ray audio, I wonder.
B00007KWHG|5.0|This CD shipped quickly, Frankie Valli is always a fun listen and this had all the hits that we expected.
0596805888|5.0|This is no ordinary cookbook, this is a behind the scenes cookbook with all sorts of useful and great information for any cook from beginner to expert. All in all, well worth every penny.
B004Q08BE2|5.0|A lot of people will say it is &#34;crazy,&#34; but I think it was great...I love the Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman :)
B00APUQT7I|4.0|It was cute and worth watching with the family.  I am not usually a fan of movie #2 or #3, but this was well done.
1475143389|5.0|Good, straight forward book that covers the basics of building a great body. Goes over diet, training, and supplementation. Some of the advice comes from studies that have been done and some comes from the author's experiences. He also spends time dispelling a lot of the myths we've been lead to believe from fitness magazines.<br /><br />I was planning on giving this book a 4-star rating, but I went to his website that is listed in the book and downloaded the one-year training program that he lays out and I got an automated email asking me if I have any questions...I did, so I replied and Michael responded within a day. The fact that the author makes himself available to answer anything you might be clear about make this a great value and a 5-star product in my eyes.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|loved this game when i first got it.  After hours of playing and getting to upper levels it froze, had to hard restart my Kindle game started over at beginning.  Thought this may have been a one time deal.  But it keeps either freezing, or sometimes it just goes back to the beginning when I open it up.  Its frustrating to have to start over almost every time I restart the game.
B009VB97EY|4.0|This is a good &#34;girls night&#34; movie.  Not much of a story line but easy on the eyes.  I will take it with on my next girls weekend for some giggles etc.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the app! I really like how I can change the background and pick my own picture....the same thing with the card faces.... If you love classic solitaire this is your app... It's pretty awesome and IT'S FREE!!!!!!! :D
B008602KQI|5.0|I read all three books and was very happy with the 1st movie.  they did a good job following the book.  the book was much more graphic/violent so they toned that down on the screen (I suppose to keep it pg-13).  Can't wait for the 2nd movie to come out.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|First 2 books were terrific and I can't wait to start the 3rd book!  Twists that you don't see coming.
0316098329|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to read a book about an abduction but I'm glad I did.  It was hard to put down.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|No plot. Just chases. Very little relation to prior plot lines. New elements added that had no relation to prior story, but were intended to.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Movie was alright for a few laughs... some parts really funny. At times, I wondered when the movie was going to end. Overall, not my favorite comedy.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|How asinine some of the \\"reviewers\\" are of this movie.<br /><br />Some didn't even watch the movie, but gave it 1 star. Yes thank you for your \\"review\\".<br /><br />Yes this is a violent movie. If you don't like great fight choreography, then move along. This movie makes very good use of the martial art called Silat practiced in South-East Asia. This is a niche film that caters to those that love great fight scenes from actors that actually know a martial art instead of acting like they do.<br /><br />This is a great pickup for fans of the genre and something to add to the collection if you're familiar with the director's (Gareth Evans) other movie (Merantau).
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Great! Couldn't stop reading until I finished. Classic for sure, ready for more. Stoked has penned a marvelous work of art
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Beautifully written but because of the wonderful use of words I often felt impatient to continue the story.  Much was lost on this reader in the ways of endless detail.  A really great story with a brilliant &#34;twist&#34;.  I enjoyed discussing it more than reading it, however.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was simply incredible!!! So much emotion was put into this book you can't help but fall in love with Alex, Katie, the kids and jo. this book is a must read!!!
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I have arthritis in my hands, and this stylus is just what I needed. It is easy to hold, and the nib seems to be quite durable. I am hopeful this stylus will outlast the typical short life of many others.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Do you need to get addicted to a new game? Well here's a great one! Cut the Rope-the goal is to try to get the candy in the little monster's (Omnom) mouth! You can also try to get all of the stars in a level! But watch out for spiders and other items that want the candy too! Sounds like a cool game right? It sure is! Get Cut the Rope today!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I knew I would like this movie. Or, at least I suspected. From the beginning I was surprised at how well this movie scored in my book. From writing to acting to directing this movie did not disappoint. I'm absolutely besides myself trying to figure out why a movie like Ted has a better story line than 80% of the crap Hollywood tells me I'm supposed to like (the dark knight rises im lookin at you). The humor is about what you expect form Seth&co (freakin hilarious and not for children) but it was well placed and not over used. Great movie! I was completely entertained and that's saying allot these days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow. What a journey I am speechless. On to the next book!!! I am so ready! These books are definitely addicting.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Surprised at how much I ended up liking this film. Th beginning dragged to the point I thought I might just call this one a lose. but I kept on and it paid off. while the last MIB flick seemed to be all about the schlock. This film surprised me at its character development and well thought out progression. Is it an instant classic? No of course not. Did it push the limits of technology in cinema? No! Was it a holism well made quality piece of entertainment? Yes. I can honestly recommend this movie, for the money it was just entertaining and fun to watch.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I wasn't really a Christina fan beyond what I heard on the radio, but after hearing her sing on The Voice I went and bought Stripped and Lotus. I am actually blown away by the lyrics of all the tracks on Lotus and I can hear through my speakers that she believes what she is saying/singing. I have so many favorites, but Army of Me is my new theme song. Worth every penny and I am telling anyone who will hear me to buy Lotus!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fan of the series I thought she let Christian off too easy at the beginning. Now off to read the last one. I could read these books forever.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I am very pleased with this.  I would recommend this to everyone who uses office.  You cannot beat the price - $0.00
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a really fun game.  We have it on my phone, my kindle, and on XBox360 Kinect.  It's the hardest and funnest on Kinect, but it's a great entertaining game when you're sitting waiting for something.  My 4 yr old loves to play it too.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|This is such a great movie to watch anytime, but I think watching it at Christmas time makes it extra special.  This is about love in all its various forms. I highly recommend it!
0142501123|5.0|We Love this story.  It's a super cute Read Aloud book.  It has rhyming verse, and a cute little story.  When I read it to my 4 yr old, he finishes the sentences for me because he knows it by heart!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Wish it didn't stop to make me rate it.  I'm not sure I will get to finish the game.II'll be quite upset if they try to make me pay for the 2nd half.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|My 3 year old grandson loves this game. He plays it every chance he gets. so you see even a child can play this game.
B004SBX112|5.0|Great game. Keeps my son and husband very busy. I get me time. Hope rovio keeps upgrading angry birds with different scenes and many levels. Thank u
141659521X|5.0|It is an exemplary work of fictional extrapolation of the facts that otherwise could not be be expressed politically correctly.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! Left me wanting so much more… I wanted to read about them as a new family, but over all, I loved the story!
B000B589JI|5.0|Checked it out fresh out of the package.  Filled it up with fluid, closed it up, laid it on its side and walked away for 30 minutes.  No leaks.  Had it in my pocket the remainder of the evening.  Walked around Walmart, my house, sat around, went up & down stairs...no leaks.  Day 1 and no problems.  My own issue is my own inability to get two flints in the holder.  Oh well, one is sufficient enough and I don't want to devote the time to put another in.  All in all, a good back up to have out of the house.<br /><br />UPDATE: This has been sitting in the center armrest compartment of my car for over 3 months full of Zippo fuel and it's still full. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This movie was weird. Parts were funny, parts were just disgusting and dirty. Some parts were heartwarming. I did not really like it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I heard about this show and am so happy it was available on Instant Prime! I watched the first two years of shows in two days ! like many others, I was hooked after the first 20 minutes!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Wonderful. Except they left out my favorite song! How can you have a highlights album while leaving out one of the biggest songs: \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\"
B0001ARCFA|4.0|For the price, they are pretty good.  They breathe well and don't bother me after wearing for a long time.
0345803485|1.0|I made the mistake of judging this book by it's cover. It's well done I'll give it that. Very classy looking, the title seems ambiguously mysterious. It seems like an intelligent book. I had also heard from many friends that the sex content makes it a guilty pleasure so I was like \\"Great I like sex in books!\\"  Turns out when they say guilty pleasure, they mean that reading the book makes them feel like a complete retard but they still like it. At least that's what I assume.  I honestly felt like the main character was a child. I forgot she was supposed to be an adult. It felt like I was reading some disgusting pedophillic exposition. I honestly tried to keep going because I hate not finishing books, and I hate judging books without having at least given them a full chance but after the 50th \\"My inner goddess did so and so, JEEZ!\\" I was ready to murder my friends for even pointing this monstrosity out to me.  I read fanfictions occassionally because they are horrifically written and are great for laughing at with friends when drunk. This was worse than any fanfiction I have ever encountered. And people are throwing millions at this piece of goat s*** and touting it's greatness.  Honestly, I feel kind of sick at that thought. It should have stayed unpublished, on the internet. Where it belongs.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is definitely a game worth downloading! I've had so much fun playing this game. It works your brain while trying to puzzle out each level and the little hand drawn characters are adorable.
B0095P31L6|2.0|This movie was not for kids.  There was language not suitable for kids and the story line was less than worthy even for adults.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|I got this to replace my aging N52TE gamepad. I started off with the original N52 when Belkin made it, moved to the TE when Razer bought it, and now that my TE's dying I hoped this'd be an upgrade. My opinion is it's a huge waste of money.<br /><br />To explain, let's go point by point. The gamepad itself is easily twice the size of the N52. I mean that literally, it's huge and heavy. Heavy's good, it keeps it from moving around during use but the fact is it's massive. To use it I have to turn my keyboard sideways and slide it back on my desk to make room. I don't have a small desk either, nor do I have small hands. Point 2, it has a huge number of buttons. I thought this'd be a good thing, I always wanted another couple on the Nostromo plus the Nostromo lacks an analog joystick. This has a joystick and it works great....but it's tiny and way too sensitive. The buttons on the G13 are tiny and numerous, meaning to use them you need to have super long fingers the size of knitting needles. The N52 keys are normal keyboard sized, so while they aren't huge, they're not a problem either. Also, to use all the N52's keys you just need to move your fingers. The G13 is so huge and the keys angled so badly you can't use the handrest because your hand's doing the time warp all over the thing's keyboard. I can use the N52 for hours at a time. Literally, I played through all of MW3's campaign in one sitting (Breaks for lunch and dinner) when the game came out with no hand or wrist strain. The G13 on the other hand, I had to stop using after 20 minutes because my whole forearm hurt. Lastly the software. It can do basic keymapping only. Volume controls? Nope. Mouse buttons (Wheel up/down/middle) nope. Other media or non key controls? Nope. A save icon so you can save your keymaps after modifying them? Nope, gotta click this little totally unlabeled icon in the lower left corner. The N52 software may be ugly and a kludge, but it's 10 times more capable. Top all that off with zero documentation and the quick start manual has no words. None, it's 4 pictures and there's no directions on keymapping, what all the non-game buttons do, or how to use any of it.<br /><br />I'll freely admit the G13 is built well. Tough, I love the variable lighting, the handrest is well built, but only if you're just resting your hand on it. The software is, I'll admit, easy to use for basic keymapping and making a new keymap for a new game is easy as pie. Modifying it's easy also, at least until you try to safe the modifications. The thing looks good, has some admittedly really cool capabilities with the built-in LCD, like a clock, system monitor that displays CPU and RAM use, RSS feeds (Though good luck getting one you actually want, the interface for adding one's useless) timer, and media display (Not controls, just track name and so on)<br /><br />Do I regret this purchase? Yep, bigtime. I'd been hoping to unify all my inputs (Mouse, keyboard, gamepad) under one bit of software (Logitech) since right now I'm running 3 different kinds (Logitech, Razer, Saitek) and this hunk of junk voids that plan. Would I recommend this thing to others? Unless you've got spider fingers and don't need advanced features then no, I wouldn't. Yeah the Nostromo has some glaring flaws (The D-Pad most people use for movement is 4 directions only, it's so light it skids around a bit, the software's overly complicated) but do yourself a favor and get one of those.
030758836X|4.0|Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I haven't read many thriller/mystery books, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was definitely a page turner. I enjoyed how the book was told from two perspectives, and I was very interested in how things worked out in the end...but then I get to the end and was not impressed. I don't know what I wanted to happen, but it definitely wasn't that.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Its pinterest, what can I say other than thanks for making something so addicting even easier to access now. LOL
B0095XPZBC|3.0|There is a fair amount of debate on this season - some say it is &#34;VHS quality&#34;, while others say it is &#34;perfect.&#34; It is neither - but it is inconsistent.<br /><br />You can very much tell the difference between season 2 and season 1. Season 1 was crisp and high quality. Season 2 has a lot of artifacts and fuzziness about it and worst of all - within individual episodes, it can be clear, HD quality in one shot and DVD like in the next. It is clear that CBS did a much better job with their transfer than the outsource firm. And I am not overly sensitive - you can definitely see the difference between the two. Now - it is still better than DVD quality overall and the bonus material is great.<br /><br />Season 2 is not my favorite season, as I believe Season 3 on are the best, but still enjoyable and worth it.<br /><br />Engage.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Like the claw game I am also hooked on this. I often find myself checking for extra coins to play more turns. it can be addictive.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an amazing book for people of all ages.. just read it, you will not be sorry. It is transcendental.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves action. The author is a great story teller and really makes you feel like you are there in the firefight with them. Great read!
B00932A2MC|5.0|Great movie will watch again, I think we bought the DVD, high adventure, lots of action, and a good story line
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The Marware Vibe Standing Case is g<br />treat for my grandchildremn. It is very easy to assemble and easy for my 8 and 10 year old to adjust if have too.

B004G6009U|5.0|My daughter loves this movie, I got it at a great price and it shipped fairly quickly. This is really a good family movie.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I LOVE the Scarpetta series very much. I am currently reading on my Kindle Fire but I have purchased every book to have a hard copy on hand at all times when I just want to read them again. The nicest thingI can say is that this book is BORING. I do not understand what isgoing on with Ms. Cornwell but I am begging her to STOP!! Did I really need to read in depth about this turtle..  I mean really.<br /><br />Another pet peeve of mine is Marino... I am sick of him. How she still has a relationship with the man who attempted to rape her I will never understand but that relationship dynamic is horrible. I feel like that have been having the same convo every book since that happened.<br /><br />I'm begging you Ms. Cornwell.. go back and read you first 4-5 books and bring that back. If there is another book as boring as this in the future..I'm out...
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|I got farely far in the game despite the fact that you cannot zoom in scenes, some of the things you have to find are hidden behind the item list and/ or the top menu, multiple items of the same thing but only one of them is counted as correct, 20 second losses when scrolling in the blackout scenes, and the slow dialog.<br /><br /> However, when I got to a scene where I couldn't find an item, used the hint, then pressed on said item 15 times only to lose 20seconds repeatedly and STILL not get the item, I gave up.<br /><br />  Uninstalling.<br /><br />  If you won't allow zooming at least make certain all items are IN the open space.  If you penalize random taps at least make certain there is only one of the searched for item and that the items are able to be tapped.<br /><br />Nice graphics, okay puzzles, needs work.  I don't have the patience.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put this book down! Absolutely loved it! Cancel any plans you have and grab some Kleenex. No matter your age you will not be Dissappointed

0061998494|5.0|Then book was in really good condition when  it arrived. It took a bit longer to arrive than I thought it would, but I am sure that is because a lot of packages are being delivered during the Christmas season. It DID get here before Christmas , so I was able to give it as a gift, as I intended. The person I gave it to was thrilled to receive this book. He had wanted it since it originally came out, but we could never find it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this book by chance and was hooked from page one! At my age, I don't waste time on a book whose characters do not intrigue me. It would make an excellent movie!
B007T99ENE|5.0|Clever story which maintains an interst throughout. His language flows easily and it is a pleasure to read. Can be recomended.
1589269063|5.0|Learning of these concepts has literally changed the way I look at my relationships in my family. It has helped me figure out what makes the others &#34;tick&#34; and, therefore, informed the way I interact with them and interpret their behavior with me. I could not more highly recommend this book (or audio book)!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|4 AA batteries last almost 300 flashes. Not very easy to use but once you get a hold of it, pictures just flow. Ive used it on dark places and sunny beaches and works perfectly for me.

It involves every emotion you can think of and more!  Read it!!  You'll see what I mean!  LOVED IT!!!

B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down. Has a twist in the middle. Good lesson for a cheating man. Haha totally kidding
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The overall idea of this app is good. When I got frustrated with one game, I would just play another. Most of the games are pretty fun.<br /><br />The puzzle games are fun and educational. They really make you think. The other games ( not puzzles) are not as chalenging, but nit as educational.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I heard mixed reviews about this movie... BUT IT WAS AWFUL! Don't waste your time or money... Raunchy and dumb.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I enjoyed The Bourne Legacy. It was engaging and entertaining. However, it wasn't as good as the first 3 Bourne movies - I missed seeing Matt Damon in the lead. It was a good movie and the future ones might sharpen up to the level of the first three, it just seemed as though Jeremy Renner was just not quite there yet.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|The planning and completion of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film \\"Psycho\\" is the subject of the new movie \\"Hitchcock\\", directed by Sacha Gervasi and starring Anthony Hopkins as the legendary director with Helen Mirren as his long-suffering wife Alma Reville. How much of the picture is authentic and how much fantasy can only be guessed, John McLaughlin's script cleverly imagining Hitchcock haunted by the legend of Ed Gein, author Robert Bloch's protoype for Norman Bates; but Hopkins really bears no resemblance to Hitchcock (the sly charm isn't there) and Scarlett Johansson looks nothing like his specially-billed star Janet Leigh. Because Alma was always a background presence (and her lack of recognition becomes an important plot element here), Helen Mirren's lack of resemblance is not really that essential. According to Janet Leigh in the book she wrote recalling her experience of the filming, the set of \\"Psycho\\" was light-hearted and friendly, but you would never guess that from \\"Hitchcock\\", because the mood appears to be consistently unhappy. For instance in one scene Hopkins in the role of Hitchcock mocks the talent of John Gavin, a surprising revelation considering that Gavin is still alive. Hitchcock's dismissive attitude towards Vera Miles is explained to a curious Janet Leigh: he had slated Miles to play the lead in \\"Vertigo\\" but shortly before shooting was to commence Miles got pregnant (by her then-husband, a baby-faced Tarzan), leaving Hitchcock Madeleine-less, Judy-less, and furious. Writer Joseph Stefano, designer Saul Bass, even star Anthony Perkins only appear briefly, the latter significantly naming \\"Rope\\" and \\"Strangers on a Train\\" as his two favorite Hitchcocks. And judging from this screenplay, you would never know that the Hitchcocks had a grown daughter, one who was given a small role in \\"Psycho\\": Patricia Hitchcock is never mentioned. Fans hoping for an inside look at the technical aspects of \\"Psycho\\" will probably be disappointed. The shower bath scene is handled rather perfunctorily, and it's not clear that it took up so much of the shooting schedule; there is only a brief scene of Marion Crane \\"driving\\" in front of a rear-projection screen, Hitchcock yelling insults at the character from behind camera; and the melon contest, with casaba the winner, would have been interesting but is ignored. The fact is \\"Hitchcock\\" never gets deeply involved in the production so that basically this is just a brisk, somewhat gossipy story of a classic filming.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|To pick up a Grisham book is an absolute delight and this one is no different. It has a rich plot, real people, twists and turns around every chapter and some elemental surprise on almost every page. I can readily recommend The Rackateer to anyone who likes fast paced writing that scoops the reader from page one and keeps on delivering until the final page is turned. And, it's the sort of novel that one keeps talking about to others. Yup! Highly recommended.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I'm a big M. Gladwell fan and I enjoy reading of his research. It's definitely a great read if you have kids or are considering. It's a book full of stories about successful people and failures as well to teach us to look outside the box when we judge people who are &#34;outliers&#34; in our society. Very interesting!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I'm reading and enjoying the entire series of books. Nesbo is a terrific writer and he has created a compelling character in Harry Hole. I recommend these books without qualification. One quibble...I bought a couple of the books on the basis of Amazon's listing of the order of the stories and discovered that Amazon's list is wrong. This makes a difference because there is a sequence to Harry's story. At this point, I've given up reading them in order. If anyone is interested in the order, it's as follows: The Bat, The Cockroaches, The Redbreast, Nemesis, The Devil's Star, The Redeemer, The Snowman, The Leopard, and Phantom. The English translation of The Bat was published this past October. As far as I know, The Cockroaches has not been translated into English. Amazon sells all the books, but I had to order The Redeemer through a partner and it looks The Bat is also available through another seller. There is not a Kindle edition for every book.
1400032717|5.0|This book is good reading for young mature readers as well for adult readers.<br />The purchase of this book was for my twelve year old grand daughter for Christmas, she loved it.
B005LAIIFS|3.0|It was 'ok' for me. Think I expected a bit more. Watched it with family.<br />Believe for family also was 'ok', based on reactions and laughs.<br /><br />The artwork and animation are superb. Really really good. Vibrant colors, vibrant characters, vibrant scenes,... lot going on for art and animations. Story was also good. But for me the movie misses on humor, jokes and laughs, we use to get from other movies. There are some, maybe several, but for mu just not enough, and not as good. Also, my mind couldn't stop wondering about the accent of the characters. Especially Santa's accent.<br /><br />I don't know. I wasn't so exited with this movie. I suppose that's basically because I like other animation movies more. Most of Pixar for example, but also others, prior to Guardians, a few weeks ago we saw [[ASIN:B0034G4OYA Hotel Transylvania (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]]. I liked Hotel Transylvania much more.<br />The Guardians was just 'ok' for me. But I'd say enjoy the good parts, sit back, relax enjoy the good parts, especially the artwork and animation.<br /><br />Our 8 yol liked the characters, I think he liked Sandman the most.<br />I think because Sandman seems the fun character between the guardians, while still being able to kick #ss! (battle with Pitch). He liked the scene where Sandman and Pitch were battling (me too, great animation right there). And I think also because of the glittering sparkling dust. It's kind of captivating.<br /><br />He also liked the joke of the giants coloring the robots blue, and later the eggs red, and later,...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was even better then the second one. I couldn't put it down. I'm now ready to read the third one!
B003UGLCIA|5.0|Still a classic after all these years and 40+ years later, the suspense and terror of the Exorcist movie is still alive and well...New scenes was also added which wasn't in the original theatrical release.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Looking forward to the next one in the series<br />The additional characters added a lot to the story.
B00005U122|5.0|Big fan of the Floyd music and this is the best production I have heard.  In particular the instrumentation and backing vocals are superb.  The play list is also hard to beat.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Could be WAY BETTER and property would be nice and the sea of the world is not responsible for the first place for! !!!
6305428352|3.0|Not for the jaded moviegoer, this is a touching, inspiring story, simply and well-told. However, technically, this is not a real widescreen movie, but rather, a 4:3 ratio screen with the letterboxed video in it. So, it is better watched in the old-fashioned CRT tvs where it looks really great. If it is watched on standard LCD/LED widescreens, it would have black bars top and bottom, left and right. The picture looks like it had been lovingly extracted from an old laserdisc and restored to best quality. I wait for the remastered version on Blue Ray or DVD, with real, anamorphic widescreen and maybe even DTS or PCM sound. For the offer price, heck, buy it anyway.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Wonderful folk singer.  It is too bad that so much time went by until he became well known in the US.
0375869026|5.0|Maybe it doesn't take courage to friend someone different.  Maybe it just takes character.  But to have character you need to have courage.  You need take that first step.  This book is courageous and inspiring.  Truthfully, it's no Wonder it's terrific!  :)
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Great musician and singer who unfortunately was &#34;lost&#34; to the US audience.  Now he's known and doing concerts.  How wonderful for us all.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book. We can all relate to the awkward high school years. s a quick and easy read. I will defiantly be suggesting it to my friends.
1926778537|5.0|It's a great artbook book for the game, the only thing I was expecting was more full color pin ups by Joe Madureira as in the first book.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|new update flips articles wrong when you have to leave the flipboard version and go to the website of the main article.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is a smart well-acted drama  I can't wait for Season 2 and don't know how I can watch Season 3 one week at a time
B008ODZUN2|3.0|The movie was okay, just really didn't enjoy the strangness of the story.  It left you filling the gaps as to what was going on and the ending left you thinking, so? what is she going to do now?
0385535147|1.0|Grisham admits he is a lazy writer and he sure is. I had never read any book by him but see his books everywhere, so I figured how bad could it be. Well I have my answer it is dreadful. I am reading along and it seems to make sense and all of a sudden the book launches into outer space with a nutty story.Waste of money and reflects  poorly on the american reading public if he is a best seller.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Compelling story, sprinkled with enough research results to be believable. Has pulled a fairly simple template from the noise about leadership and motivation. It looks like it ought to work.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Good writing, great acting, only wish it was PG-13 I don't like that they have to add all the R crap...
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|its so easy to get lost in this game. creepy setting and fun games! I would recommend to everyone. I hope they make a second one
B00007ELF2|5.0|I think the title of my post says it all.  You cannot go wrong with Criterion Collection.  Great directing, casting, acting, script...everything!
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|There were no surprises in the 2012 version, more of the same only better special effects. I give it a 3 out of 5 stars. Better to rent instead of buy
B00899F0G8|5.0|I am so glad for Amazon Instant Video. I started watching this on Netflix with no intentions of watching it again,  and I was hooked! To catch up on the new shows I watched them on here. Excellent video quality!!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Ive used this app for about six months now and it has lived up to what it has said it should do,which is ...download music and video in MP3 OR MP4  format from Youtube in a timely fashion.Also,you can just watch Youtube videos if you want on it in if you are on a Wifi connection<br /><br />Pros:Downloads music and video to my kindle fire fast and easy with a tap of my finger.<br /><br />Cons:Might freeze up on you once in a while ans slow down your kindle.<br /><br />Overall:A must have app for any kindle user that want free music or loves Youtube videos and wants to watch them while offline or online.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|If you're not familiar with the tale, you should be. I downloaded this for free from Amazon as a one-day gift and I really appreciated it, though I would have paid full price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i like this game because it is fun to play and it has trains and a cop and a dog
B007L6VR12|5.0|Sure, it's capital Q Quirky.  And I hope they paid Bob Balaban extra for wearing that ridiculous gnome outfit.  But if you let yourself into the universe of this movie, it's worth it.  Maybe it doesn't quite touch the heights of all time masterpieces of whimsy like \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Big Deal on Madonna Street,\\" but just the brilliant pairing of Benjamin Britten boy's choir music with the poetic goof of the imagery alone would make this film soar above average indie fare.  Alexander Desplat's score strikes the right notes, too, holding its own alongside Britten, Schubert, and Saint Saens.<br /><br />But at the core are the characters, and I bought the intense and weird love story around which everything else winds.  Think of this as Blue Lagoon starring the cast of \\"The Munsters,\\" \\"Fargo,\\"  and \\"Edward Scissorhands,\\" and you'll have the idea.  Add the overall aura of enchantment, and you have something as charming as the French music on the soundtrack.<br /><br />One of a kind-- and a brilliant gem.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Movie works like brand new. Got here fast, and wasn't too expensive. I was very happy with my purchase! Thank you, will definitely look at more of your items.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is as good as the first book, maybe better. I'd love to see this one as a movie too! I just didn't want to put it down. I can't wait to read the last book!
1401937268|2.0|I appreciate the quality of these cards, and they do tend to give accurate readings, BUT, I do not like the size of these cards at all.  They are too square making it almost impossible to shuffle with any ease.  I am used to riffling cards but with these the best you can hope for is to pull them apart to shuffle, but then groups of them fall off the bottom of the deck... All they had to do was make them the traditional Rider Waite size (narrower and taller rather than wider) and they would have been perfect.<br /><br />Another dislike I have is renaming the suits.  There is nothing wrong with wands, cups, swords and coins, so why go and alter that?  Just makes for more difficulty and I'm a seasoned Tarot reader having read cards for nearly 40 years.<br /><br />If you get these cards you'll either have to fan them out and pull the cards that way or have large hands.  Good luck.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game to play when you have a few spare minutes. It's so easy without the hassle of cards!
B003UESJHO|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Got sent to the wrong address and quickly turned around to get it to me before Xmas!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Not nearly as good as the previous Bourne. The action scenes were good, but the plots failed to intrigue me.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|The game lasted about well over 2 hours and was great fun.  I got stuck on one puzzle, but the game has a help guide built in that got me past that.  The puzzles are not too difficult to solve, and are challenging enough to keep them fun.  Performance on the kindle fire hd was great.  No crashes occurred.
B006RXPUR2|4.0|While I didn't quite buy some of the plot turns in the last half hour, I was very involved and very moved by this film - and found the characters and atmosphere brought to full, vivid life.  HIghly recommended.
B000FA57N0|1.0|I'm not technical....I wasn't aware that this HD DVD wouldn't play on a PS3....was not use to me....donated to charity.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Great band if you like the heavy or white stripes. Blues and old rock, punk roots. Will buy more of their albums I'm sure.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was good and funny I wish I could give it 10 stars<br /><br />I hope Jeff makes more great books
B00APUYN0I|5.0|A really great movie. would watch again. really. A really great movie. would watch again. really. A really great movie. would watch again. really.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Works great... keeps temps between 22 and mid 30's (C).  Installing by yourself is a little tricky, but if you read the instructions carefully and have some patience you shouldn't have a problem.  I installed it on an Asus P8Z77-V & Intel Core i7-3770 (LGA1155), and would definitely recommend it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love Quell &amp; Quell Reflect! Great way to solve problems without office politics. Been playing on Kindle Fire, iPhone &amp; other devices. All have the same great experience! More coming?
B005C0DHIK|5.0|I saw the movie while on vacation and it was just so stunning I had to get it and show my friends/
B003N0XDT4|1.0|I received one of these for Christmas and was excited to use it.  But it would not hold a charge--the battery display on the screen would flicker from empty to full like there was a bad connection.  Only worked when plugged into PC USB, would not turn on when disconnected.  Fine.  Returned to Amazon and ordered a replacement because I really wanted a portable DAC for my phone (which really wouldn't push audio too loud to my headphones).  Replacement arrives and I plug it in--no flickering battery indicator, I figured I was golden.  Nope.  This one would not hold a charge either.  After some googling I found out that this is a pretty common problem due a bad run of batteries in late 2012 models.  These should be pulled from the shelves.  I'm returning the second one and I ordered a FiiO Andes (E07K) to replace it, hopefully this one will finally work.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I left my phone in my husband's car and didn't have my alarms. I downloaded this app onto my Kindle Fire and it is PERFECT. I LOVE the nightstand feature and that you can dim it! It's the perfect alarm app with great customizations!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I rarely review things, so here goes.  If you have not started reading Kevin Hearne's Iron Druid Chronicles, you need to stop what you're doing and start reading it.  Now.  I lovey dove dove this series.  B@da** druid, modern setting, every book tackles characters from different religious and spiritual pantheons.  Kevin Hearne is laugh out loud funny.  Really funny.  Great adventure.  Legendary swords, action, great dialogue, and gods as main characters.  Just awesome.  I'm gushing.  And there's a talking dog that talks exactly the way that I imagine my dog talks to me -- of course, the dog Oberon speaks telepathically with the main character, Atticus, while I narrate out loud for my dog at home.  The spirit of the discussions are the same, though.  Anyway, I've read the whole series thus far and am still enamored with it.  Read them in order, starting with Hounded.  These e-books are worth every penny.  Alternately, if you want to kick off your new year's resolutions right and spend some quality time on the treadmill, you can also find these on audible.com.  The narrator is fantastic and you won't be disappointed there either.  Happy reading and thanks to all of you who take the time to write reviews.  As I said, I rarely write them, but I always read them.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Everyone of the kids are all joining in with this Nerf shooter - It holds a huge number of bullets and is easy to load.  Really a great neighborhood toy for all the kids.  They spend hours with them.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I just love this series and introduced it to my sister who had to have it also.  I bought this second series for her birthday.  The interaction between all the characters is so brilliant. I watch it over and over.
B005QIE5U2|5.0|Dana has a voice that is perfect for the blues.One can hear the influence of Janis Joplin, Melissa Etheridge but combined into Dana's own unique beautiful voice. She is one very powerful singer, great range, beautiful tone.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I am obsessed  with the series Supernatural! I could sit for hours watching them. The dvd was received quickly and as expected. No complaints!
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Who wouldn't want a drunken, pot-smoking, foul-mouthed, horny living teddy bear as a best friend?  Or Mila Kunis for a girlfriend.  In &#34;Ted&#34; Mark Wahlberg has both.  Lucky bastard.  The film is vulgar, tasteless, raunchy and politically incorrect.  Everything you'd expect from Seth McFarlane - and more.  And just as importantly, LESS.  Constrained by the requirements of telling an actual movie length story with real (somewhat) characters, McFarlane brings everything that *works* about &#34;Family Guy&#34; to the table while dropping the self-indulgent too-long gags and other padding that are often used to stretch a good 10 minute sketch idea into a 30 minute episode of the sitcom.  I look forward to his next film.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I am obsessed  with the series Supernatural! I could sit for hours watching them. The dvd was received quickly and as expected. No complaints!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book puts people's names on historical information and makes it very personal.  My wife and I would recommend this book as well as the first book in the series and look forward to the third book.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I am obsessed  with the series Supernatural! I could sit for hours watching them. The dvd was received quickly and as expected. No complaints!

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I am obsessed  with the series Supernatural! I could sit for hours watching them. The dvd was received quickly and as expected. No complaints!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Quite a fun game.  It's kind of like Risk meets Monopoly without the downsides (everyone isn't vying for the same property nor does it take hours to complete 1 game).  It is easy enough that you grasp the concept within the first game and you can bypass the &#34;newbie start&#34; altogether.  Definitely going to get the knights expansion soon.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved this Movie. We watched on demand over the winter break while my twins were home from college. Laugh out loud funny.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I has such high hopes for this book. I guess it was all the hype. I think 3 1/2 would bee better. This really could have been a better book with some work on her writer skills. I agree with everyone about how every time she is \\"flushing\\" or Christian is \\"quirking\\" his lip. And the sex scenes...... sigh. There was so look much repetition in this book, I found myself predicting what the characters would do next. Like I said this could have been a good one but needed some SERIOUS work on the  writing part.
B001IF252M|5.0|Used this to connect my VGA cable to my Sharp television. Worked just fine with my Macbook Pro from 2009. However, no audio. I'll be getting the wire for that. Remember to adjust the resolution in System Preferences if necessary.

B008XG1X18|5.0|It does not crash like the iPad version?  I'm using it on my kindle and works great.  The iPad version crashes every second
B003O86FMW|3.0|This review is about the Kindle formatting, not the book itself. Did anyone else's Kindle edition come up double-spaced? it is driving me crazy and the lackluster beginning to the book is not keeping me engaged enough not to be distracted by it. I keep feeling like I'm reading someone's term paper. Please make it single-spaced Amazon!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|You must be a huge fan of the Family Guy show to get through this movie let alone let out  a chuckle. Not funny at all!
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Not as entertaining as the earlier versions.  Sometimes movie producers will just throw anything together and plunk the successfull title on.  Figuring earlier viewers will again be entranced.
0393307050|5.0|First book of a great collection that my husband is absolutely in love with. I purchased this book again for his boss who really likes naval and historic novels. I particularly like this book cover that has a ship on it, as opposed to the one with the picture of Russell Crowe in reference to the movie.
B000000H57|4.0|The cover did break and fall off when I opened the CD, so I had to throw away the case. But, good thing I put everything in my own CD case. The music sound is perfect, so the CD was in fablous condition and thats all I really cared about!<br />Thank you!
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|Ana Popovic's  'Unconditional' is a killer CD. I saw her a while back and had to have it in my collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book had my heart hurting one minute and soaring the next.  It was a great story of tragic circumstances and  best of intentions that led these characters to finding themselves exactly where they are  suppose<br />d to be
B000001F6N|5.0|Too bad kids today either don't know about or can't remember this stuff. It was 'A Hard Road' to get to where we are now musically. I don't think that what passes for good music today has much to do with the roots of John Mayall. This Idol/Pop crap sucks.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. I enjoyed the movie, the story was great, I just personally think the previous movie was better. But this one is still worth a purchase. Why wouldnt you want to complete this awesome trilogy?

B0084BMUFA|5.0|When my son came home from school with exhaustive reading assignments from this book, I knew I had better follow it along with him in order to be ready with an answer when he asked.  I had read it in the past, but the questions that the teacher asked required detailed reading.  As usual, the quality of the ebook was excellent, but as was expected, his reading was based on page numbers that don't exist in the Kindle format.  However, the fact that it was portable and I could read ahead when waiting in line or had a few down minutes made it worth the purchase.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|I have tried many tuning apps for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 but I would suggest \\"Battery Doctor\\" which is a very good app for Kindle as well as my iPod touch to clean cache, kill unwanted running apps, helpful tips and statistical data as well. Very nice graphic interface as well.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Interesting read. Very good. Wish there was more to it, I didn't want it to end. Maybe a follow up?
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a good app with nice graphics and power estimates and energy consumption diagram. But I would suggest \\"Battery Doctor\\" by KS Mobile which is a very good app for Kindle as well as my iPod touch to clean cache, kill unwanted running apps, helpful tips and statistical data as well.

B008LH4YYC|5.0|This is a very good app for monitoring usage of your devics RAM and cache and clean them. I like this app for my kindle because there is no shortcut inbuild for this device to close running apps. This app helps me to do that.
B0089XH38M|5.0|This antivirus app is comparable to the avast! app in this amazon appstore! In fact, it seems that the AVG app has more protection options than the avast! antivirus app. I might as well keep this app alongside my avast app. Everyone, protecting your mobile device is very important. Remember that.

B006WQLH7G|5.0|Many might think that there is no virus currently on the Kindle Fire, but I recently downloaded an .apk file(Android apps are .apk) from the internet, it had posed as a Youtube app. When I downloaded it, and completed installing it, it took a life of its own, and started sending some(hundreds) of website requests to some Israeli website. I downloaded this avast! app, and it has been amazing. I hope everyone downloads this app. This will protect your device COMPLETELY.

B004TSXUWY|5.0|Steven Tyler hit it!  - Well hell fire save matches, f*** a duck and see what hatches.  The duck hatched a gigantic mindf***.    Short recap:  We have a woman in her forties who has a rare case of amnesia. Everytime she goes to sleep it wipes he memory clean. In the morning, when she wakes up, she doesn't remember who she, where she is, how old she is or who the person that is sleeping next to her is. Panic sets in. Then the husband have to explain to her (everyday, over and over again) who and where she is. That she had a bad accident which cost her amnesia, that it happened 20 years ago, he is her husband, they had a son, who was killed in Afghanistan when he was 19. And everyday she goes through the same emotions. First panic, then grieve, confusion and hopelessness.    As I started reading, I found the beginning quite boring. It was the same thing over and over again. Some good old doctor appears out of nowhere, telling her that they have been meeting for quite a while now and that he wants to help. He suggests to her to write a journal. The most of the story is told by her journal. At the beginning it's pretty much the same thing everyday, she wakes up, panics, then her husband goes through the same ritual explaining to her everything til she comes down. It goes on about 20% of the story. She does remember some things, or maybe it's just the pigment of her imagination. She is doubting her self. Is it memory? Or is it just something that her desperate mind making up, trying to find some answers? Which also makes a reader to doubt it, too.    When she started to remember (?) more things, it raised my suspicions about who is telling the truth and who is lying. By the time I reached 40% everyone looked suspicious and full of s***. She remembered some things that made her suspicious of the good old doctor. She confronted him. He was lying. He said he wasn't, he just wasn't telling her the whole truth, because it wasn't his place to tell. His side of the story sounded very convinsing and it made me think that her husband was lying. But why? Then, she confronted him, he wasn't happy about it. Surprised, shocked but he too had an explanation. Not only that, he had some documents and pictures to back his side of the story up. Although he was lying I kind of understood why he did it. I think I would have done it the same thing in his shoes. Two different people telling two very convincing, but very different stories. It left me totally confused.    To add it to it all, some long lost friends reappears out of nowhere, saying she is beyond happy to finaly hear from Christine. Hm...    And here where things started to get very confusing. You know one or more of them are lying, but who? Which one of them? Why, what's their agenda?    Then, Christine remembers even more thing that makes all of them look suspicious. And then, I made a conclusion that it's always the husband. I mean it have to be, right? In most cases, it's always the husband.    Reading this book was like trying to crack the da Vinci code. It was impossible to guess who did it and what their motives were. Halfway through it was impossible to put it down. More memories  resurfaced, which helped to dismiss some of the suspects. About 70% in it I felt like I had all the answers. There where still some insignificant questions unanswered, but I thought it was ok. It wasn't that important. But then I thought \\"I still have 30% to go. What now?\\"    Then, the whole hell broke loose and I realized that I didn't know even half of the story. I never saw it coming. The ending was brutal and a bit sad, but brilliant.    It was a total page turner. Disturbing but amazing story. I can't wait to read the next book from this author.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is the best book ever!!! Very heart felt, interesting and wonderful!!! I couldn't put my Kindle down!!! I recommend this boo k to any kid or adult!!!
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|I really like this game. It's like a puzzle in a way but it's a little tricky. Other than that great game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Do yourself a favor and wait until Friday before starting this book, that way you won't feel bad that you stayed up all nite reading it because you simply could not put it down. Seriously this is an awesome book, it will leave you breathless. Kudos to Colleen (I love her novels) she puts such passion into developing her characters and her story lines always seem to consume you. JUST WAIT UNTIL FRIDAY ;-P
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The presentation is nice. And I like how it keeps a memory of the last transaction. It's worth your time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I began reading this because my friends were raving about this book. I was resistant at first, but it actually a great love story. And of course the sex was exciting. Thanks, will read again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is not about &#34;Kick and punch&#34;.  This game is about building things and they can play together on 2 different devices.  I have it on 2 Galaxy 7&#34; tablets and they can watch what the other is up to.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|The trials and tribulations that the leading lady, Becky, played by Rachel McAdams, must put up with should make anyone who has worked for a living groan and laugh at the same time. Though Becky is bit too perky and her foil, the ever-grumpy and deadpan anchorman played by Harrison Ford, is a bit too grouchy, the cast and story make for an enjoyable and entertaining movie. I wasn't expecting much when I started watching, but the movie, its characters, and the writing are excellent. One of the best movies I have seen in a while. This one is not in my traditional genre, but I liked it very much and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, light-hearted comedy.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|Fun, passionate, and adventurous.  Everything I love about the author.<br />I always enjoy Lisa's work.  A great deal like Austen with spice!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I was enthralled! Just when you think you have it figured out something else or someone else is added in the mix. It was like a puzzle...must read!
B009JNXK88|5.0|Platform game with many twists. Runs fine on my devices and is great for killing time.Anyone who enjoys those games will enjoy this one,
B000BVMAJ2|4.0|Every toddler and preschooler loves animals. That being said, this is a great toy if you use as a supplement for a basic brick collection.  Other than that, the animals are a safe size for babies.
B006O3MU96|5.0|Smooth UI.<br />Good new features.<br />Runs well on most devices.<br />Good devs.<br />Game is a plat former that goes up and up(similar to the original abduction game).<br />I recommend for most people.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Very Pixar. Some amazing animation. Visually very beautiful. And while I always say if you have to distract me from the story with scenery you're story cannot be very good, the story is very good. If not a little obvious.  Great puns (both verbal and visual). Over all very good and a good family movie. Very young children or slightly sensitive viewers may not like the scenes with the bear (can be a tad violent) and many jokes can be borderline &#34;adult&#34; but not inappropriate.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I remember playing this as a kid and it brought back so many flashbacks. Smooth ui and still fun to this day. Recommend to anyone.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The grandkids love this new game fashioned after their heroes of Star Wars. Fun, but challenging at first but we are at the higher levels now.,
B009KHBDUU|5.0|Johnny Depp never fails to amaze. He plays an awesome (and very confused at times) vampire- great for the family.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This book is a must read for anyone in who has a general interest or love of information Science and  technology.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I really enjoyed the original take on one of the fairy tales I grew up with. Very action packed and engaging. Would be a great movie to watch with the family if you have older kids.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I Love it! Did not skip a song. The whole album had a flow that made you not want toskip. Rihanna is indeed the best in the game! Diamonds in the sky...
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This is a powerful peek into the future of China v. USA for geopolitical dominance. It is more a brain battle than muscle power. It highlights the vulnerability of the USA to &#34;cyber-attacks&#34;. My work in the computer field has shown me the delicate balance necessary for a network to function properly and this novel shows how much dislocation can occur with a well-placed virus. Any of you readers who have been &#34;hacked&#34; know the frustrating outcome. Jack Ryan, Jr. and his colleagues detection, analysis, and combating of the attack from China is an interesting insight into intelligence trade-craft in all of its facets.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint does it again, This well written, well acted and well directed film was a joy to watch. A great movie to watch on a lazy day with the wife.
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|I already loved Shore's Lord of the Rings soundtrack. With his Hobbit soundtrack, he's brought back all the appropriate LotR themes, such as the theme for the Hobbits as a people and the theme for the Ring and so forth, and then he has added more themes for this story in particular. The Dwarves' theme I think is particularly excellent, beginning with the truly wonderful &#34;Misty Mountains&#34; sung by the Dwarf cast themselves and expanded into orchestration with lots of rich brass instruments. Beautiful.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I loved this movie; of course I like dick and fart jokes, which this movie is full of. The shocking actions and dialogue coming from an adorable teddy bear had me rolling on the floor. This is not a movie to watch with the kids, but if you are looking for just ridiculously stupid humor you will love it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app looks and works great.  The different screens let the user know how much battery life remains for using the device for different purposes.  The app also integrates well into the interface of the kindle fire, fitting into the pull down screen.  I definitely don't regret paying a little for this great looking app!
B009329Y30|3.0|Rented this as a chick flick for the wife. While it is most definatly a chick flick, it had enough action and intriguing enough story to keep me entertained as well. While this type of movie are not my favorite, I did enjoy it.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This is a great album!  I love listening to all the songs on it.  And, I was able to get it on a great discount through Amazon MP3 on Christmas which made it even better.
B0068FZ1C8|5.0|In fact, an extraordinary film you may never have heard of before. Converted to a highly successful Broadway show, still in its 6th year running in London, it has been touring the States now for some two years. About a young lad who is forced to take boxing lessons by his macho father and older brother during the miner strike in England in the early '80's, Billy stumbles into a ballet class...and, well, you can use your own imagination to know the conflicts and emotional roller coaster ride all are invited to enjoy in the films conclusion. One of my favorite films of all times, and have seen the stage musical 60 times/plus over recent years. Every one can relate to this story, and all youngsters, parents, and teachers should see both the film and the musical.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I was very excited to read this book, being a sucker for stories about circuses, but I do believe the book is over hyped. The imagery was great, I could practically taste the caramel and feel the excitement of the black k and white circus. However, the story was a bit confusing, the characters not quite as deep, and the ending particularly weak. I highly recommend reading Water For Elephants, which is one of the best books I've ever read, as an alternative to this book.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|Love this movie, Action packed with twist and turns, I am a big Bruce Willis fan and  I was happy with this one.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I loved this movie, well worth the ticket price, and well worth owning it. This fantastic series just keeps getting better and this final installment is by far the best of them all.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Weak tea. Don't bother. The storyline is insipid and uninspired and entirely predictable. The characters are pretty standard cliches with little (if any) development during the course of the movie. The music is cloying and generic Lilith Fair derivatives. And it really has very little to do with bravery. The art direction and animation is decent but not really anything that we haven't already seen.
0316228532|4.0|Rowling is exceptional at character development, and is now showing great prowness in her ability to weave a \\"normal\\" length story.  Unfortunately she made every effort to create a cast of characters that are all somewhat or very undesirable.  I cannot say that I found any attachment or desire to get to know any of the characters any better, and feel that they all have such depressing lives, that I do not want to visit their little hamlet ever again.  Maybe that is the point Rowling was trying to get across?  Still a master, but I hope her next venture finds a more endearing cast, and less foul language as it does nothing towards the story line, only creates an unecessary distraction for the reader.  Bottom line is, any book that leaves me with this strong of a reaction, good or bad deserves at least 4 out of 5 stars!  Glad I read it, glad I'm done with it!
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|Movie was just boring and below average. Only funny parts were in the previews and it w<br />As even a little dark at times...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before i read the book and the movie does it no  justice. The connection between Katniss and Peeta is magical.
B008EDGBW6|3.0|There are a few songs I don't like because it steers away from the previous vocals Chris used. A fair amount of songs are ones I would call my favorite. However, if you are a fan this is definitely something to own.
B00488SU02|5.0|this movie will make u think about the death penalty in america. if we are going to attempt to be a united states, i don't think we can have such extreme punishments for the same crime. some years ago i went to a jail to visit a young man and he had a list of states where not to go. bad jails. he was just drifting with no concern for minor crimes. anybody watch the documentary on the bail out u see the harvard lawyers in congress saying there was nothng wrong about lying to steal the pension funds. and congress approved the bailout instead of throwing the whole bunch in jail. that is the america the young can look forward to. God have mercy on us.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Works great!! I got a couple of different of these and this one actually works really well! Happy with this!!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I had my doubts about this movie, but I really liked it. It was like watching a new version of Alien.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great!! I got a couple of different of these and this one actually works really well! Happy with this!!
B006K3796E|5.0|We bought this game for my nine year old niece who was extremely excited about getting it.  She had just beaten the junior and was on to bigger things! It turned out to be fun for the entire family.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Lightening delivery and Great product. Have purchased from them in the past and never been disappointed. Will definitely continue to come back and have been recommending to friends!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|If your going Afield, or going into get down dirty combat, this knife won't let you down!!!!Blade grind excellent,Handle scales 95 out of 100 Micarta would be better,Fit and Finish 100%,Like I said awsome, this is probably one of the top1 or 2 survival knives made! GET ONE!!!!!!!!
0307960471|5.0|Jo does it great, just as good as Stieg.  Fantastic character development, realistic story lines, grab the edge of your seat suspense.  The translation is fantastic, I wonder what it would be like in the native tongue.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Got this for my Go Pro. Works very well. Long cable, which I will have to trim at some point, but helpful if I want to put the mic farther away (i.e. auto). Battery is a bit large and on/off tiny. But I can operate it with gloves. The alligator clamp holds well enough to attach to my Chesty harness.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the wind cover is always falling off. also its too small to block wind noise above 10-15mph. Of course, it is not designed to do that (mic looks like it is designed for dictation, etc). I will get a bigger cover and probably glue it on.<br /><br />Very happy with the sound. I can't stand listening to the terrible stock mic.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Once again, the Blues has a new, fresh approach...I highly recommend the Alabama Shakes debut CD.  Every song is a keeper and a real treat for your ears.  Try it, you'll LOVE IT!
B004J64QSI|5.0|While this is not the actual play, the 25th anniversary does a good job at depicting the story line. I have been a fan well before the movie came out and grew up watching the 10th anniversary and it was cool to see some of the old cast come back again. This has to be by far the best musical and they have done an excellent job with picking great vocalists.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|This DVD is almost as good as sitting on stage for the show! The sound is amazing and the video crystal clear.  I've seen Joe live, 20 rows away, and this DVD rivals my experience.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really liked all of the characters.  The vintage dresses were absolutely beautiful.  The story line keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. It was done in good taste and did not subject the viewer to sex scenes.
B007US9NA8|5.0|A few weeks ago I wondered into a Cleveland Public Library trying to get a hold of this book. They brought me two similarly titled books by different authors. It was more of a picture book filled with scary monsters. This is NOT what body building is all about. Elegance & Proportion are two key factors, not mere SIZE. It is important I know but not to the point when you look like an over-inflated balloon. This book on the other hand is a book about art, art of sculpture, of your own body. I am half way thru the book and still am fascinated by Arnold's contribution. This is a MUST have in your personal library!
044024630X|5.0|am just in the middle of it but it's a page turner  I am looking forward to seeing the Jack Reacher movie
B000RJO578|4.0|The dvd came in on time and in good condition.  It came in a clear plastic container not the original case.  I'm still happy with it.  Velinda Kelly
B000PMLFRA|5.0|We bought it as a gift for my mother in law, but we &#34;tested&#34; it out before giving it to her.  Great quality, good price.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book. Is full of feeling and heart. It will make you cry and laugh and your heart will expand and contract more than once. Another great book by this author.
B004FOA84A|2.0|This is my first stab at a &quot;solve the mystery&quot; game and I was really enjoying it, right up until I tried to retrieve an item from the clock and it stopped working. Kind of frustrating to pay for an app, get that far into the game and be unable to finish. The graphics are decent, but it would be nice to have the option to ask for a hint. Not too impressed overall.
B0074MZSPO|4.0|Alabama Shakes is yet another discovery I made in a very fruitful year of 2012!<br /><br />Having enjoyed Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeroes, I've kinda accidentily stumbled upon this band...I gave it a try and wasn't dissapointed!<br /><br />They are a band that you'd expect to hear in a good ole coffee-shop or a jazz\blues saloon!<br /><br />They've got the groove and vibe of the 60s Motown era SOUL, Blues and Rythm & Bass!<br /><br />The sound of the instruments is very vintage and analog-ish! The vocalist has a kinda Tina Turner meets Aretha Franklin and Janis Joplin kinda voice which suits the music PERFECTLY!<br /><br />Overall I'm pretty much pleased with my purchase, despite the package was very late...<br /><br />Good quality vinyl and polygraphy, all clean and tidy mint manufactured in the USA + a nice bonus 7&#34; vinyl 45  with 3 additional extra songs and a download code!<br /><br />For a price like that, I can say it's one of my best buys!<br /><br />Give it a try, it's a new band, but trust me if you're an OLD SCHOOL SOUL, if you realy dig the 60s stuff, you will absolutely LOVE this one!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I wasn't too thrilled with the first book however after giving book two a chance I can say that buying book three was a no-brainer.
B0086700CM|4.0|fun for everyone. great on road trips and keeping the kids busy. I have the game on all electronics for them.
0394800184|5.0|I'm so glad I found this book.  I had a copy when I was younger and wanted to find a copy i could read to my newborn son.  Arrived on time, ... product as described- hardbound and colorful.
B003VWU2WA|3.0|I really do not know why I purchased this. It's fun to play with and serves as a glorified volume knob. I setup a apple script to put the computer to sleep on a long hold. It does add some nice desk appeal with the blue glow and brushed stainless look. It also has some nice weight to it and does not feel cheap. My only suggestion would have bee to make the cable flat so that it could be placed underneath a monitor stand. Overall its not a bad item to have on your desk.
B0038P59A0|5.0|It's a must see. this movie has all the elements you seek in a great movie. I would see it again.
1419705849|5.0|It was a book my daughter wanted to read.  She loves this series and was so excited when it arrived in the mail.  Thank you for a speedy transaction and delivery.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It is a really good sharpener. It works very well for different kinds of knives. I gave it to a friend of mine who is a big fan of knives. He liked it very much. I bought another one for myself.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I'm not a critic so I'm not going to judge the movie Lawless other than to say that I like it.
0920236162|3.0|It's a cute book but I am a little weary of the ending with such a young audience. I purchased this for my four year niece and she has been using the word bum since she read the end haha!<br /><br />Still cute though :)
B009X2CUYA|4.0|Another great read from Kate Morton. Interesting characters in a most unusual setting. If you are willing to suspend disbelief, you'll enjoy this yarn.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was very personable. You feel like you are right there with Charlie and want to help him and say it's ok. I really enjoyed it, and loved that it could be very relatable to any teenager facing the problems of growing up.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Well written story about an interesting character. Main characters nature brings a lot of funny, charming and compelling events in true fantasy style. Also, I really enjoy the special bond and meetings the main character shares with 'Denna'.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a game that is very addicting and mind challenging I just can't stop playing it's that much fun for me
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Well written story about an interesting character. Main characters nature brings a lot of funny, charming and compelling events in true fantasy style. Also, I really enjoy the special bond and meetings the main character shares with 'Denna'.
B004EPZ034|5.0|This movie is cute for kids.. my 3 1/2 year old has been a Chipmunks addict since age 1!  I got her this movie, with the Chipwrecked: Britney Speaks! book, coloring book, and the Chipmunks TY Beanie Babies to give to my little one for Christmas.  She's going to love watching the movie this Saturday with her TY Beanie baby chipmunks, the reading the book right before bedtime!
0345472322|5.0|I underlines 1/2  of the book and finished it in a week. I can hardly wait to use the mindsets in my classroom on dropout students. I also saw my own negative mindsets on a few important topics. The material is recent, well-researched, and written in a reader-friendly style. It should be on every parent's bookshelf. Every teacher needs a worshop on the topic of growth mindsets.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's a twisted Cinderella story  . Sexy,fun,increasingly keeps your attention. I love it, can't wait to read the other two.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|Cute movie for the holidays season. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B008QLXSG8|5.0|This book was very misleading but always interesting. I wouldn't recommend this book for sophomores because the material is mature and has more meaning behind it than a teenager can comprehend.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Not sure what I expected from a childrens book made into a movie but it was pretty good. . .
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome and extremely fun. At least, before my bro accidentally deletes my dragonvale account after a Facebook mixup.  Anyway, charge your device, go to your couch, sit down shut up and play dragonvale. Booyah.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a good book. My teacher recommended it to my 8th grade class. I think it was a great read and any middle school aged kids should read it to understand the importance of individuality and being independent. It helps teach kids when to learn to let go of things. My all time favorite book! Thank you Stephen Chbosky for writing such an amazing book!!!!
B00AA7O22U|2.0|To be fair, I have to say that we only made it through... maybe 15 minutes? But, it was all we could take. Maybe it got better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, at that time we were like \\"who even cares!\\"
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think that this book is amazing because it shows how a boys life can be rewarding or non-rewarding life could be. Which I can definitely relate to.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This felt like it was going on a bit long, but overall it was still enjoyable. Lots of &#34;uh oh&#34; moments and &#34;Jeez.... now what?&#34;<br /><br />Matt Damon even showed up! Huh? you say... LOL<br /><br />Overall another successful entry to the Bourne Legacy!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|AMAZING I LOVE IT WAS THE FIRST PLACE IN THE WORLD OF THIS YEAR AND THE FIRST PLACE IN THE PAST.ZERO AND AMAZING RACE
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I have played almost every Dash game on PC, so I was excited to get Cooking Dash for my Kindle. The game is fun and works really well with a touchscreen. The big problem is that you have to keep paying to unlock the various levels. For the price you pay for this \\"Deluxe\\" game, you get the first 5 levels plus a bonus level. You then have to pay to unlock the remaining levels. I am not sure the PC price points translate to the tablet form, since tablet games are typically less expensive. And I know I would prefer to have it laid out for me exactly what is included in the deluxe edition and the price points for the rest of the levels, so that I can decide whether it's worth it to buy.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|I think it shows how to expect the unexpected.It gives a fun and entertaining story to read at free times.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I played this game on my ipod recently and was so excited to see it available for my new Kindle, where it's even more gorgeous. The artwork is beautiful and the gameplay is lots of fun. I find that the game provides a good challenge; I am motivated to play levels several times to get the gold medal, but I never hit a level that I just can't figure out and that makes me discouraged. I hope new levels are added soon, because so far all the levels have been great!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Bones Are Forever by Kathy Reichs is similar to other of her works<br />but gives more insight to the person of Temperance Brennan.
1616614609|5.0|Card quality is high, rules are clear and game is one of the best. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys Player v. Player games.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Charges multiple devices fast. Flashlight is bright, durable and sleek design. Must have in today's age of battery sucking smartphones.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I have read all books in the Scarpetta series and feel that this is the worst one.  I had a difficult time getting into the book, with so much devoted to getting the body out of the water.  The storyline was not well connected and felt like the murderer was picked out of a hat.  His connection to Marino remains a mystery and also the motive for the murders.<br />Seemed as though the murder scene and murderer were stumbled upon by accident. Benton  and Kay' s relationship is still a mystery. And what is the status of Marino?
B0085W6II8|2.0|I bought this album last summer with high expectations. The first month of listening to this I was always waiting for myself to catch the feel of this album. By October I was still waiting and had not been able to put a five star (I Love IT) mark on any of the songs. Most were at the three star (It's OK) mark by then. IT is now the new year and I don't have any of the songs on my rotation anymore and feel that I wasted some money. I love both Squire and Hackett but this album just never connected with me. Hope it does with others.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I was so excited to see this movie since the previews makes it looks so funny. I will have to say was a little disappointed. It was funny but not the best.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This trilogy is great reading. The 2nd book is by far in my opinion the best of the three.Read them and make your own judgment.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I rated it with the 5 five stars.  The product was good.  the clarity was just the same as if I watching the original show on tv.<br />I bought it to watch at Christmas time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This third book is a fitting conclusion to this fascinating saga. While I was a little disappointed in the ending (my opinion of course) I was certainly not disappointed in the overall story. Read this trilogy!
B000L53D4O|5.0|product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game feels like the old Duke Nukem, except with a jet pack. It's very fast paced, and the graphics are stellar. Game play is smooth and crisp; controls work well and are responsive. It's the kind of game that might induce an epileptic seizure. There's so much stuff flashing and blowing up onscreen. But it is just good, clean fun. A worthy time waster that stands apart from the rest. Who doesn't wanna fly around with a jet pack?! This'll be the closest most of us will ever get. FUN!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|My Mom loved this it was fun to play the Christmas music with her. Easy for us to learn and play.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I've been hooked on Pac Man since it was originally released in arcades when I was a kid. This is one of those milestone games that changed everything when it came out. And it's definitely a classic that still holds up. I've been looking for a good Pac Man app ever since I got my tablet. And the cheap knock-offs just didn't measure up. This one is the real deal, and plays just like the arcade game. The virtual joystick works flawlessly. I may just have to buy the full version of this one. It's Pac Man; how could you NOT?! Hope Ms. Pac Man and Junior are soon to follow. App plays well on my ICS tablet, and Android 2.3 phone. The BEST is BACK!

B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is really a neat game. Basically, you're in a kitchen setting, it starts on the kitchen table, and with some one-eyed lumps of pudding on it. Your mission, is to smoosh all the jiggling pudding blobs into one big wiggly-jiggly, multi-eyed blob. It's funny to watch them shimmy and shake, and interesting to see all the different possible shapes they make when they're all smooshed together. They almost look like glistening jello cups, more than pudding. And it makes me laugh when they're all gooped together as one big blob, with multiple eyes blinking at me. Some pudding blobs have special powers, like oozing goo, or smashing blocks. Basically, you swipe your finger across the screen to send each blob hurling into the next. But be careful -- you can easily fling them right off the table and lose the round. Collect stars for extra points. The controls can be a bit glitchy, but I'm guessing it's related to the ads. The ad-free version probably plays smoother. Overall, a real fun and original game. Will definitely have fun with this one for awhile. :oD

B006O3MU96|2.0|I know this was top of the list for a long time as a &#34;must have&#34; iOS app.  I downloaded the Christmas special app for Android, and have no idea what all the fuss was about.  Graphics stink, controls are strange, and there does not appear to be a tutorial on how to play.

B002ZG98UA|4.0|Alice is back!  That's right.  Our favorite zombie-slaying heroine is back for the fourth installment of the popular Resident Evil franchise.<br /><br />The story picks up from where the last movie ended, and starts off with Alice and her \\"sisters\\" attacking the underground Umbrella facility in Tokyo.  If you will recall from the previous movie, Alice told Albert Wesker, the CEO of Umbrella, that she will be coming after them.  True to her word, Alice and her clones fight their way through the security forces and confronts Wesker.  However, Wesker escapes.  But not before activating a timed explosion that destroys the facility, and kills the clones.  Alice and Wesker fight inside the tilt-rotor.  Wesker manages to stick Alice with a syringe that neutralizes her special abilities, but in so doing, took his attention from piloting the aircraft.  The plane crashes.  We see Alice walking away from the wreckage.<br /><br />Months later, we see Alice on a plane flying towards the source of a mysterious radio signal from a group called Arcadia.  Upon landing, she is attacked by Clare Redfield.  After sorting matters and removing the controlling apparatus from Clare's chest, the two fly south towards the west coast.  Eventually arriving in what was once Los Angeles, they make a risky landing on the roof of the city penitentiary.  They join forces with the last survivors in the city.  Meanwhile, outside the prison, zombies are trying to break through the iron gates.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the movie for you.  But this is your typical RE movie.  Lots of action from the main characters.  Jovovich is fun to watch.  Lots of great stunt work.  But alas, the lickers do not make an appearance.  However, a sack-masked, axe-wielding T-103 does make an appearance and goes on a killing rampage.  The plot is fairly simple, naturally.  The focus is on the action and on MJ.  Joining Mila in this movie are series regulars Ali Larter, Boris Kodjoe, Kim Coates, and Shawn Roberts.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a serious rollercoaster ride... It has so much emotion in it and really draws you into the characters... I loved this book I was hooked and couldn't stop reading it. It transitions so well from present to memories. I definitely recommend this book.

1451695195|5.0|Loved Dr. Alexander's attempt at explaining his experience.  Words are just symbols twice removed.<br />The first thing in understanding ANYTHING, is understanding that you DON'T understand anything!<br /><br />His experience coincides with what is taught in A Course In Miracles.<br /><br />From A Course In Miracles:<br /><br />Revelation is intensely personal and cannot be meaningfully translated. That is why any attempt to describe it in words is impossible. Revelation induces only experience. Miracles, on the other hand, induce action. They are more useful now because of their interpersonal nature. In this phase of learning, working miracles is important because freedom from fear cannot be thrust upon you. Revelation is literally unspeakable because it is an experience of unspeakable love.<br /><br />To Mr. Alexander...  (words by Hazrat Inayat Khan)<br /><br />It is mentioned in the ancient scriptures that angels came with messages to the prophets of Beni Israel; but the explanation of this from the metaphysical point of view is quite different from what an ordinary person would imagine. No man on earth is capable of communicating with the angels in heaven, nor is an angel from heaven inclined to communicate with man. But in the exceptional lives of the prophets what happens is, that they rise above all the planes which keep man removed from the angelic heavens, and by doing so they are able to touch these heavens. And being charged with the ever-glowing fire of inspiration from the angelic spheres, where they come into touch with angels they descend to the plane of the earth; and it is then that their words become tongues of flame, as spoken of in the scriptures. This means that every word of theirs becomes a torch given into the hands of those who listen, to illuminate their paths through life. Specially is this so in the lives of the Great Ones who have given a divine message, a religion, to the world; their souls have never been disconnected in any way withthe angelic world; and it is this current, which linked their souls with the souls of the angels, that always kept them in contact with both heaven and earth. The soul of the prophet is therefore a link between heaven and earth; it is a medium by which God's message can be received.<br /><br />Then there are some spiritual souls who have had the experience in their lives of having been helped or warned by an angel. It is such souls who have kept a thread unbroken which they brought with them from the angelic world; they may be conscious of it or not, but there is a telegraphic wire which connects their souls with the souls of the angels, and they are conscious of having had contact with the angels.

B001HN6EF4|5.0|My husband bought these for me a long time ago, and then I saw how much my niece was into the game so I bought her a set for Christmas.  I think they are so much better than the regular deck of Uno cards.  The don't bend or tare and it does come with a ring you put your cards on so you don't lose them.  If you wanted, you really could play in the tub or swimming pool with these.  I also like to collect different playing cards and the waterproof ones are always my favorite because they are so durable. It's a must buy if you have kids and like playing this game!  This deck will last forever!

1451695195|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but must point out that proof of Heaven is found through faith in God's word, and not in the Eben's NDE story. I absolutely believe in the existence of Heaven, Hell, God, Jesus, and Angels, etc...I also firmly believe that through prayer, Eben was miraculously healed of his sudden and bizarre illness. However, he did not succeed in convincing me that his particular NDE was void of any scientific explanation. In fact, I think he should rename his book, \\"Proof of Divine Healing\\" instead of \\"Proof of Heaven\\" because he does not provide definite proof of Heaven. In the book, Eben even points out that if we are given definitive proof of Spirituality in the natural realm, this interferes with free-will. So, why did he state that he is providing proof in the title?? I don't know the answer to this question, but he certainly put together a good story about his NDE experience. He dogmatically defends the authenticity of his experience by stating that his neo-cortical region was compromised without further explanation.  The best piece of advice that is offered in the book is when Eben's son tells him to simply write out his NDE experience before looking at any of the popular literature on the subject. Unfortunately, Eben does not always follow this advice. In fact, toward the end of his book, his writing really started to fall apart, and he made at least one statement that made me seriously question the authenticity of his experience. For example, in the chapter on the enigma of conscious, he makes ridiculous statements about consciousness affecting physical measurements which have been discredited by the physical science community. In this chapter, he talks about being one with the universe, and I had to hold my nose until the end of the book. I think the most damaging statement is where he compares his NDE to experiences that he has had under the influence of hemispherical brain synchronization programs. What?? How could that possibly be true??One of the leading scientific refutations against NDEs is that they are similar to lucid dream and out-of-body states that are produced in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and programs that produce beat frequencies like hemispherical brain synchronization. I think he should have followed his son's advice, and not drifted outside of the confines of describing his own NDE experience and expertise in neuroscience. If I were the editor, I would have deleted the last few chapters of the book, and placed more emphasis on the power of prayer and the miraculous healing event.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|You can play and play even after you have won. Graphics are pretty and play is smooth. But I never got frantic with a challenging board. Also the object placement puzzle at the end of each section doesn't seem to add to your score or penalize you in any way.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|There is no excuse for the stupidity of the plot, characters, and even the action -- all acting insensibly to manufacture unconvincing drama.<br /><br />As a bonus, you get lots of aristocracy propaganda.  It is Batman written for the 1% and their fans.

030758836X|4.0|I purchased this book because it was on the Best Seller list for so long I figured it must be a good read.  It IS a clever mystery novel with twists and turns that you keep you intrigued throughout.  The book is written in chapters that alternate between the husband and wife's narratives, which makes for a compelling read. If you are expecting a \\"who dunnit\\" that ties up loose ends in the last chapter, you will not get that satisfaction from this book.  It is, however, an intriguing mind-bending study of just how far a dysfunctional marriage can go!  I recommend this novel and it sounds like a movie version is in the works, so all the more reason to read it sooner rather than later!
1612680011|1.0|This is a indeed a junk book to say the least.<br /><br />All this books talks about again and again and again is how 'you got to have financial literacy' without giving any real substance of financial literacy.<br /><br />still wondering how one could write a 200+ pages book without imparting any real substantive financial knowledge.<br /><br />If someone gifts this book to you, demand money for reading it :)

B0068FYZMK|5.0|I am a big fan of the composer Camille Saint Saens and his music, which was heavily used in this movie, drew me in.  Check out his Carnival of the Animals composition.  Also, I cant eat a ham sandwich for a couple weeks after seeing this movie.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|Lets put it this way, my wife (played Santa) and got me this wonderful item for Christmas.  I wish this came with a remote much like the Halo edition one does, never the less this item will be super useful in traveling.  Especially when I go and see the inlaws and they might want to use the TV for a while.<br /><br />My older Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 slim fit perfectly in the case.  Please note you can not put them both in at the same.  Just wanting to make sure people understand that.<br /><br />As for the screen I wish the resolution would be a bit better.  It does not beat out my 32 inch vizio but for temporary gaming on the road it will do the trick.  Also, another small down fall is that there is hardly much space for your stuff to be in the case.  I can not bring put my video game wallet and turtle beach XP300's in their. It can store a controller and all the other accessories (controller, power brick, wireless adapator-if you use the older Xbox 360 model and the cords).<br /><br />Please note the HDMI chord is in the Styrofoam not in a baggie.  At first I thought they left it out.  lol.<br /><br />Overall a great product if you will be traveling for a while.  I am wondering will TSA allow me to take it as a carry on.  Hope somebody will tell me other wise I will find out later :).<br /><br />UpDate---I did fly with it in May 25-26.  No problems with TSA.  All went well until I by accident put my feet on the case and heard a crack.  When I opened it up the controller though in the sleeve thing inside damaged the screen.  Lots of dead pixels.  It is way past it's Warrenty.  I believe it is fixable only if you know what you will be doing.

I also like this show because the characters are all unique  and bring something interesting to the show. The Big Bang Theory is in a  class all by itself  and I'm glad it is on DVD so I can get my Big Bang Theory fix whenever I want.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|I must admit that I really enjoy Dame Judi Dench in each and every show or movie from comedy to drama.  Here we see a group of older individuals looking for something in a foreign land.  And though the time they spend together at the Marigold Hotel, they all find answers.  A touching film that most adults should find satisfying.
B000J103OI|5.0|I am very happy with the movie I ordered from this seller. The movie came within a few days of placing my order. It came as stated on Amazon, and I got it for a great price.

1594488886|5.0|I happened upon this intriguing story and kept reading into the horrific exposure of a distant world.  Yet not so distant since my country has been indirectly involved throughout my lifetime, throughout movements and ages,<br />so to read is time well spent for a vivd realization of anothers' hostile environment, pain, and sacrifice. To read is to have another intimate understanding and perspective unique from our general news coverage.<br />It's well paced and written so I read on as betrayal and injustice form a vista of horror channeled upon one vivacious family and their community-suddenly declared war zone- a captive place without refuge.<br />How can they survive such terror and uncertainty?  Don't tread lightly, just persevere, through fractures and exposures until when, thankfully, ones' youthful determination comes redemption for innocence.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is a great game for free. The ads are a little of a pain, but to be expected in a free version. My only complant is that it is hard to quit playing. Definately addictive!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|John Corey's humor is funny, makes me chuckle....but DeMille ran it into the ground.  Corey's insincere thoughts, when hearing life threatening situations, made the plot less credible.
B00979CS50|1.0|As a long-time Neil Young fan, I looked forward to this album after reading others' reviews.  What a disappointment!  The best songs on it are mediocre, and the worst invite a quick move to the next track.  Throughout, the lyrics are monotonous and dumb, and the music just lopes along endlessly.  There are moments of sheer nonsense in both.  To top it all off, the 88-minute effort covers two disks, so it cost $20.  It's a gyp, and Neil Young should be ashamed of this effort.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|I've read a number of his books, and I'd like to see him go to more SHORTER chapters, like patterson
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I Absolutely love this show! At first it took me a bit to get into it, seeing as how much the level of violence there is and how graphically real a lot of it can look. I fell in love more so with the well written context of dialogue between characters and the challenges they face, which is achieved greatly with this superb cast. A definitely great buy if you're a fan of the Zombie Apocalypse genre or in for some good entertainment.

B0059XTU22|3.0|After the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I hoped and expected that director Peter Jackson would stick to the same format for The Hobbit. In some ways he does, but the feel isn't exactly the same.<br /><br />What I like about this first installment of Tolkien's first trip to Middle Earth is that the same sets are used for Hobbiton, and many of the actors return. It was also a good idea to reprise some of the music used in the previous trilogy. When I saw the familiar setting and heard the music, I was already partly won over by the movie. Unfortunately, my opinion had changed long before it finally ended.<br /><br />So why do I have mixed feelings?<br /><br />The first major problem was the decision to make this much shorter story into a trilogy. Many of the scenes felt overly long, and did not serve much purpose. I didn't have a watch or a phone with me, but it seemed as if we spent around an hour in Bilbo's house before the quest even began.<br /><br />The Hobbit is the tale of Bilbo's first adventure. After a visit from Gandalf (Ian McKellen), dwarves start showing up at his house unannounced. This unwelcome interruption of his routine is disturbing to Bilbo (Martin Freeman), as he learns that Gandalf has persuaded the dwarves that Bilbo should join their quest to retrieve their stolen gold from the dragon, Smaug. This part of the story shows the initial stages of that journey.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what The Hobbit wanted to be, or what the intended audience was. Like the books, some of the scenes involve characters breaking into song on a few occasions. I found this to be annoying rather than charming, but I am sure that some will be happy that songs were included. One of the flaws with the generally excellent previous trilogy was the use of humor. Well, The Hobbit turns that element up several notches, and most of it is incredibly stupid. The first clue was a belching scene at dinner in Bilbo's house, but the humor was relentless. The most out of place example was when one of the major villains died and had to deliver a one-liner as he expired. For me, this had the effect of completely removing any tension or drama. It was like watching a Roger Moore Bond movie set in Middle Earth.<br /><br />The choice of Freeman as Bilbo seemed odd to me, but I must admit that he did a decent job. A few of his lines were actually funny.<br /><br />I'm sorry to belabor the point, but the use of humor seemed to contradict the overall feel of the movie. Half of the speeches were too epic in tone to be taken seriously. I didn't know whether I was watching a Shakespearean production, a spoof, or an action movie. One of the people sitting behind me felt compelled to laugh at almost every line of dialogue, so the jokes obviously worked for somebody. My idea of humor would be to have Hugo Weaving saying \\"Mister Oakenshield\\" in his best Agent Smith voice, so it's probably a good thing that I didn't write the screenplay.<br /><br />It's a shame that The Hobbit doesn't seem to be up to the same standard set by Lord of the Rings. The movie's opening has been incredibly successful, and my theater was still sold out two weeks after it was released. I have to wonder how many patrons will return for the remainder of the trilogy.<br /><br />The setting is beautiful, and some of the actors return, but there are too many inconsistencies for me to give The Hobbit a passing grade. If you want to hang out in Middle Earth, watch some great special effects, and admire some enormously detailed sets, you might enjoy the movie. If you care about the books, or the characters, you may be sorely disappointed. I saw the film four hours ago and can only put faces to the names of four of the dwarves. They were thinly-drawn at best.<br /><br />This release might just persuade me to skip the other two installments in theaters. I'll borrow the Blu-rays and see if the story improves.t of place example was when one of the major villains died and had to deliver a one-liner as he expired.

I have to wonder how many patrons will return for the remainder of the trilogy.<br /><br />The setting is beautiful, and some of the actors return, but there are too many inconsistencies for me to give The Hobbit a passing grade. If you want to hang out in Middle Earth, watch some great special effects, and admire some enormously detailed sets, you might enjoy the movie. If you care about the books, or the characters, you may be sorely disappointed. I saw the film four hours ago and can only put faces to the names of four of the dwarves. They were thinly-drawn at best.<br /><br />This release might just persuade me to skip the other two installments in theaters. I'll borrow the Blu-rays and see if the story improves.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|the story is very interesting and it grabs you right from the beginning.  As it goes on the plot grabs you and leads to the suspenseful conclusion.
0439882826|3.0|This is truly a piece of art! BUT, I only gave it three stars because one of the main pop-ups was torn off. The shipping prize from my country is really high, therefore I cannot get a replacement, since I will have to pay the same prize as I paid for the book itself...
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Oddly enough, my toddler loves this one. She loves experimenting with the different sounds. You can even change the volume of each sound!
B005LAII12|5.0|Exactly as my friends described this movie. It came with both the theatrical and unrated versions on the same disc.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|Cool little moble. When i purchased it the discription said it came with 100 glow in the dark stars, it did not. So beware of the fine print.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Was extremely happy to find Paul Rodgers and  a few other great performers on this DVD. Great production and sound quality.

B00064AM6C|4.0|I've never bought a concert on DVD before. It's a decent DVD, interesting method of recording and I always love their music.
0061537969|3.0|This book got three stars because it kept my interest, but didn't surprise me or challenge any previous paradigms. The writing style was simplistic and easy to read, perhaps overlly so. The author interspersed his own preachy opinions in a few places in ways that seemed to be a poor attempt at subtlety.<br />The fact that it was a quick and easy read made up, in part, for the preachiness. Also, the overall moral was uplifting and positive.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book is amazing. One of the best books I've read by far!!!! Definitely in the top 5 truly amazing.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Recipient was very happy to receive these movies.  he loves the Bourne trilogy and will watch over and over again.
0316228532|5.0|I loved this book. The symbolism and the juxtaposition between scenes and characters makes a person think a lot. It's great.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I love this case.  It fits and works much better than the last one I had.  The kindle snaps into a hard plastic casing that holds it securely into the case.  I love that I can turn the Kindle and set it up either vertically or horizontally with ease.  This one worked out great!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Funniest show on tv. We got this for my wife for Christmas and as a family we've watched the nature first season in two weeks. It's a great tv show. My kids are teenagers and I would say its Pg-13.

B007FJFDXS|2.0|I thought it was going to be more of a puzzle, but it was not a puzzle. Yep. No puzzle.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Take some of what makes Scifi movies good and add in a dash of why Zombie movies are fun.  This is a really good series, and I am genuinely surprised I hadn't heard of it before.

B005G5PPGS|5.0|Awesome!  Wonder filled work of American literature.  Stupendous display of talent by Michael Lewis and a basis for the movie.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|For as much money as facebook has, they should be able to afford to do a decent app. This is just horrible. Nothing wants to load. When I try to refresh it tells me that I either have no Internet connection or having network errors. The only error I made was downloading this app.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Thanks<br /><br />I wished all of them are free and because it cost little much and I just read the whole book and 10 stars or I don't know
082300659X|5.0|Great book, especially for beginners but not a bad reference for experienced artists as well. The CD that comes with it has some really good tutorials!
B000KOZMUE|5.0|Compact so you can always have it available. Uses 2 AA batteries so no problems finding them. Flexible, as flash head rotates for bounce effect.<br />Sorry its discontinued.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game! It is one of the best games ever! I never would have gotten this game if it wasn't the free app of the day. I tottally recommend this game!!!!!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A really well done production.  Humorous, insightful and a pleasure to watch.<br />A cast of suberb actresses and actors, who got it right.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I have never read Polar Express and was replacing a lost one. When my  friend's son opened it , he was so overjoyed to see it again he kissed it. That says it all.
0307272702|5.0|From someone with a Masters degree in Exercise Physiology @1980 - this book goes against all the science that I pioneered, then taught, and now must disregard.  We were wrong, Traubes is right.
B00722ZHG6|5.0|This was requested by my 14 yo daughter, she was happy with it, it shipped quickly and was in good shape, new as described
B0073PPNE8|5.0|It really is a fantastic movie...it in no way glorifies war, which is refreshing. I don't even really like Nicole Kidman as an actress, but the movie is just so great...
0307405095|5.0|It was exactly what we wanted and was in the right condition.  We saw it at the library and it's pie porn, so good!
B0097UGXFK|5.0|The Hunger Games was a compelling book, and this film is a very good representation of that.<br /><br />The primary changes I observed were a switch from first to third person perspective and a compression of the Games.  The viewpoint switch deprived the audience of Katniss's inner thoughts, but had the substantial advantage of allowing direct observation to the Game Masters which Katniss wouldn't be able to observe, as well as to other scenes both in the capital and elsewhere on which the book couldn't report.  Especially for film, which is inherently more visual, this was a strong change.<br /><br />On the compression side, these changes were all well chosen, and had the book followed a chronology closer to the film, I think little would have been lost.<br /><br />In contrast I am reminded here of Running Man by Stephen King/Richard Bachmann.  There, the \\"event\\" was an extended, real-world chase.  When Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in the film, the game was brought into a compact arena and substantially compressed.  For the film, that worked much better, although it was a very different thing then what King had written.  In this case the film adheres closely to the book's events except that events are somewhat simplified and the time span tightened.<br /><br />The characters as described in the book are well represented in the film.  The acting was in general excellent.<br /><br />But perhaps the best thing about the film was how the glitzy production of the Games was brought to life.  This goes to multiple levels, from the brilliant interpretation of television host Ceasar Flickerman to the views of the game-masters at their control panel.  The naked horror of adolescents being sent to violent death is glossed over as entertainment.  The appalling odds of the Games where only one survivor is allowed represented as a fair competition.  This is reinforced by a conversation between the Game Master and the President: \\"hope is more powerful than fear\\" in controlling an oppressed people.  Strong stuff, and an example of a something enabled by the perspective change to third person.<br /><br />The slick production of the Games could easily have taken over to the point where the audience is sucked into buying this as an acceptable entertainment, but this wasn't done.  Underlying the slickness is always the harsh reality that this is a tool of oppression, of forcing an imprisoned people to have their children butcher each other.  People are capable of supporting enormous cruelty, and that is as true of contemporary movie audiences as it is of citizens of the Panem capital.  Yet the audience of the film isn't allowed to go there.<br /><br />As with almost all films made from books I enjoy, I thought it was a bit rushed and could have been longer.  But I was very pleased the action preceding the Games wasn't cheated: the book is in three parts, the first of the three before the Games and, sure enough, this was around 1/3 of the film's duration.  I had feared the film would have bypassed this portion to get straight to the action.  For example, Lord of the Rings focused heavily on the fighting, disproportionate to the books.  Here the film focused on the more important aspect.  Indeed, given the brutal theme of the fight-to-the-death games, the book substantially limited the explicit violence, and the film honored that choice.<br /><br />So if you liked the book, the film is a must-see.  If you liked the movie, you owe it to yourself to read the book.<br /><br />I gave the book 4-stars, as I thought aspects of the story seemed strained, but I think this film did an excellent job of working with the book, using good judgement in where to make changes, yet remaining remarkably loyal to the original work. I wouldn't necessarily rank this, on its own, as one of the all-time film greats, but as a representation of an important but imperfect literary work, it is remarkable.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Once I started the season, I couldn't stop watching! I am hooked and can hardly wait for season 3 to begin.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|I am a huge Beatles fan and believe that George Harrison was the most talented of them all. His musicianship really comes out in this collection. I highly recommend it!
B002XXLKHY|5.0|I love this movie.  It is just heartwarming and so funny. Will Ferrell never disappoints! And Zoe is a favorite who is sweet and has a great voice.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The only reason that I did not give this book five stars is because sometimes the romance in the novel gets a little too thick and goopy. But seriously this book gave me chills on multiple occasions and took such an unexpected turn I was entertained throughout the whole story. Hoover is  a talented author and storyteller. Hopeless is now among my top ten favorite books.
B005LAIIA8|4.0|I remember having seen Tim Burton's original short film Frankenweenie, and as a kid & even now as an adult I love it.  I own the VHS of the original short film, as it had never been formatted to DVD, and I'll always keep the VHS if nothing more than just nostalgia.  It is unclear to me if the DVD/Blu-Ray release will contain the original short film, but I am hoping that it will so that I can watch it again.<br /><br />When I first heard that Tim Burton was going to do an animated reimagining of Frankenweenie, I was excited...I have been a long time Tim Burton fan and was very intrigued to see his reimagining of his original film. Sometimes other people will venture to try and remake classics, and a lot of times they'll wind up being mediocre or not even all that good, with some exceptions of course.  However, knowing that Tim Burton would be remaking it, it'd be good.<br /><br />The movie follows the same concept...a boy who loves his dog and loses him figures out how to bring him back and does so.  However, in this extended remake, other kids catch onto this and decide to try and bring back their own pets and things go horribly wrong.  I am not going to say anything further about it for anyone who has not seen it, but things get a bit out of control in the end to say the least.<br /><br />Much as the original Frankenweenie was a great homage to Frankenstein, this reimagining is a great homage to monster movies in general.  I'd say there are parts in this that maybe might be a tad scary for kids under 5 perhaps, but that's up to the discerning parent to decide.  Beyond that though, I'd say this movie would be enjoyable to pretty much anyone, especially to anyone who enjoys monster movies, especially the classics.  I'd definitely check it out!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|the graphics are good. It did freeze up once. the free version only allows u to play a quarter of the game but $2.99 is not much to get the full version.
B0095R6OBS|4.0|In light of Tim Burton's reimagining of his classic Frankenweenie, I felt maybe I should come on here and rate the classic film.  I have no idea yet whether or not the classic short will be on the DVD/Blu-Ray of the new Frankenweenie, but either way, even though I have no VHS player, I will likely hold onto this VHS anyway...if nothing other than for nostalgia, being a Tim Burton fan & all.<br /><br />I have enjoyed Tim Burton films since I was just a kid, and this was among the first of his films I ever saw as a kid, aside from Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands.  The rest is history.  I own the general majority of his works, between DVD and Blu-Ray.  The original Frankenweenie is likely the only VHS I own, other than my wife's many classic Disney VHS tapes.<br /><br />I won't waste my time going into what this film is about, because undoubtedly you have an idea if you're familiar with the new one, or have likely read the description on this movie's page.  It is only near half an hour long, but it's an entertaining and enjoyable half hour.  An fun little homage to Frankenstein that all ages could enjoy.  If you have never seen this before, pay the small amount to watch it here on Amazon, and then of course do see the latest reimagining of it afterwards as well, if you have not already.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|co-worker got me hooked. hard to stop. very enjoyable.makes me want to scream sometines but worth it . good job
B007REV4YI|5.0|My dad and I are action, espionage, and sci-fi fans...as far as action & espionage is concerned, it has been a long standing tradition of ours to go and check out each new Bond movie when they come out, a tradition that has been in effect since the time I was a kid, back when Roger Moore was still doing Bond movies and Timothy Dalton soon took over on a couple of films.  Since that time, we have only ever missed a couple of Bond movies in the theater.<br /><br />We had gotten to see Casino Royale in the theater, which we both had agreed was pretty good...and we liked Daniel Craig as the new Bond.  We missed Quantum of Solace in the theater however, and while we both agreed that it was good, we didn't like it as well as Casino Royale, and definitely not as well as past Bond movies before it.  Upon seeing Skyfall however, both our faiths were renewed in Bond anew, and in Skyfall we both felt Daniel Craig put forth his best performance as Bond, even more so than Casino Royale we felt, which was pretty dang good itself.<br /><br />Not only were the performances by Daniel Craig, Judy Dench, and the rest of the cast stirring and enjoyable to watch, but the action in this film also shined it's best out of all 3 of the new Bond films.  On top of that, it was good to see Bond's humor and his filanderings with women return...what would Bond be without those things?  Understandably, Casino Royale was the start of a whole new franchise of Bond films, and in his beginning these kinds of appetites did not quite exist...Casino Royale was more serious, as well it should have been, and Daniel Craig shined there, and now once the Bond most know and love has returned in Skyfall, Daniel Craig is no less brilliant.<br /><br />This Bond film apparently is the highest grossing Bond film of all time according to an article I have read, and it doesn't surprise me because it is fantastic!  It is my favorite Bond film since Goldeneye...I felt that was Brosnan's best Bond film, and I really enjoyed the agent pitted against agent concept in that one, which is also probably a little bit of why I liked Skyfall too because in fact Bond is pitted against a rogue agent in this as well...who also, as it were, is completely insane...Javier Bardem plays this maddened rogue agent brilliantly too!<br /><br />If you're a Bond fan or any kind of action/espionage fan at all...you NEED to watch this Bond movie!  It is simply awesome and quite enjoyable from start to finish...it's engaging enough that it won't even seem like the 143 minute length of the movie.  A great film in the start of a new franchise of Bond films!  Bravo!joyed the agent pitted against agent concept in that one, which is also probably a little bit of why I liked Skyfall too because in fact Bond is pitted against a rogue agent in this as well...who also, as it were, is completely insane...Javier Bardem plays this maddened rogue agent brilliantly too!<br /><br />If you're a Bond fan or any kind of action/espionage fan at all...you NEED to watch this Bond movie!

B005KIQ32Q|5.0|My father purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 8-year-old son (younger than the age recommendation on the box), but we had a blast putting it together over the holidays.<br /><br />It's really impressive!  The gears and mechanisms, including a \\"functioning\\" 4-cylinder engine, rack-and-pinion steering, rear differential, and amazing gearbox for controlling the crane, are super cool!  We even kept it as a centerpiece on the dining room table all week (and played with it quite a bit).<br /><br />We estimate that it took about 15 hours to assemble, but it was something we looked forward to working on every day.  We'd find the pieces for each step and give them to my son who would put things together.  It would go a lot faster if the adults were doing the work, but my son had a blast doing his part and watching it (slowly) come together.  We all really enjoyed it!!<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars for durability.  It's not going to break, but it might come apart...it's Lego!  I wouldn't recommend smash-up derby with it.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Bruce Willis, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Jeff Daniels, and Emily Blunt (great performances by all) plus the concept of this movie is what drew me into it...and I absolutely had to get to the theater to see this after it came out.  I called up my dad, as I suspected this would be a movie he would enjoy as well (we both are big fans of action & sci-fi, and long time Bruce Willis fans), and we arranged to go out one afternoon and check this one out.<br /><br />Going into the movie, all we both really knew was that it was sci-fi and there was time travel involved...and the trailer we saw had looked good.  What we got though was more than we'd expected, and what we both agreed on was probably one of the most original films in sci-fi lately!  We both very much enjoyed this film, and of course the day it came out I purchased it, because I knew I wanted to add this gem to my collection.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about the plot and spoil anything for anyone, but the one thing I will say is that, from the best I can describe it, the movie is a combination of Time Cop, Butterfly Effect, and Firestarter/Carrie...with a little bit of Die Hard thrown in.  It is not in itself either one of those movies though, but those films definitely came to mind during the course of the movie, though albeit it's own entity, and by the end of it my mind was blown...it was one of those Neo type thing with me by the end.  \\"Whoa.\\"  If you're a fan of sci-fi/action, I highly recommend giving this movie a watch...if not a buy!  It's a great flick!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wasnt sure about paying almost $7 for the kindle version of minecraft but I am so glad I did. Both my kids love it and it is the number 1 game they play on their kindles. They go back and forth between creative mode and survival mode. The game works great on kindle fire hd.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This was a good movie. If you're looking to watch mindless sci-fi where you don't have to pay any attention, I wouldn't reccomend. But good acting...

0811879542|5.0|Absolutely love this book!  I can be very picky about what books I will read in my classroom & I was definitely not disappointed with this selection. I knew I loved it but once I read it several times to a total of 4 small groups of preschoolers (a total of 21 children) I knew it had the most important seal of approval.  They were completely engaged with the book and their faces said it all. Besides the fact that it is just a FUN book, it lends itself to working on soooo many things....it is simple text so you could work on sight words, you can work on following directions, you can work on finger isolation, hand separation, it can be tied to learning colors, color mixing, studying the art of pointillism, counting with 1:1 correspondence, positional words, opposites, left/right concepts, gives children opportunities for sensory input, opportunities for art exploration, & soooo much more!  I highly recommend this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games. This is a really good book. So good I could not put it down. Everyone should read it.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|So, there is good and bad in this game.<br /><br />First, the bad-<br />  So, the worst thing about the game is the controls. Specifically, the touch to choose is good but the game needs to know when you zoom in the screen, move the screen around when it is enlarged and to shrink the screen back to normal. See, the game penalizes you twenty seconds when you tap too many times and don't click a legitimate item. So, if you're searching, enlarge the picture, and move the screen too much you can lose a lot of time. This needs to be fixed as it causes a lot of lost time in the game. That is the biggest problem.<br /><br />Now the great part is that this game is very easy for a younger player to learn and to enjoy. I played the whole game with my child and we had an amazing time. And my kid was surprisingly awesome at the game. It made for some excellent memories and time with a loved one. I definitely recommend this game but I still hope they will fix the penalty recognition for &quot;random taps&quot;.

B003CSV7TK|4.0|I had always heard that &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34; was a wonderful movie. Now, finally, after seeing it for the first time. I would agree.<br /><br />But beware: This is not timeless in the same way that &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34; is. The &#34;trial&#34; of Kris Kringle was bit outside of my ability to temporarily &#34;suspend disbelief&#34; to enjoy a good movie. Nevertheless, the movie is charming and a good way to spend an enjoyable evening during the holidays.

B0002KZAKS|5.0|This is a great quality microphone and at a good price. Keep it mind it is XLR, for those that haven't noticed. XLR is a better quality than other connections. It's the same physical shape and size as a rock band microphone (Looking for a good comparison.), and is MUCH better quality. It's flawless in quality and doesn't give any feedback. I would recomment for anyone, especially having such a great price.

B0041KVZ1I|3.0|This review is for the record quality, not the content. The content is perfect in every way.<br /><br />I love The Beatles and I'm extremely disappointed in the remastering of these vinyl records. First of all, the covers are crap. But I can deal with the crap covers. Even when one of them came in bent. But the quality on my Abbey Road vinyl is probably better on a vintage version. There is surface noise the entire way through. I'm not quite sure why there would be popping and noise on a brand-new record. After paying $20 for a record I expect the best quality possible. I read that the main guy responsible for these newly remastered vinyls said that collectors HAD to listen to these. I beg to differ. Go for the vintage copies.

It's not one of my favorite King novels and I can't say I'd recommend it, but it was interesting enough to get me to the end. There's a lot of mental illness in the characters and I wasn't sure how I felt about what King suggests about those with mental illness. Mental illness runs in my family, including in me, so I'm sensitive to books that vilify the mentally ill as violent and dangerous people. Two main characters are clearly ill and sadistically violent. Two other main characters are clearly ill, but are also good and loving people who help Lisey triumph over her challenges. It's a tricky topic to navigate. Is it okay for a crazy person to call herself crazy? I guess it can be, if she likes and accepts her illness and isn't disparaging herself. I like the idea that the mentally ill can have gifts that make them particularly valuable, even though other sick people kill. I don't know. This book was okay.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is a rare intersection of amazing design, writing, voice talent, music, art, and so much more. Not a single aspect of this game feels like it was just thrown in without thought, every theme the game explores is reinforced through story and mechanics. I could write pages upon pages about how, and why, this game is amazing.<br /><br />Buy it now!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Nice followup to the first one. Not very deep but very enjoyable. Looking forward to the third in the series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is addictive!  Can't wait to see more.<br />My husband and I are enjoying each episode and hate that we have to wait for season 3!
B001QWBM62|2.0|This product drinks up the battery so fast that it can only last for half an hour . If it was only  be used with AC adapter, how can it be called portable ?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is truly one of my favorite books. I loved it. I really wasn't expecting what happened to happen. Its written extremely well and made me cry. If you loved Colleen Hoover's other books, you will certainly love this one as well!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is so cool and fun if you like games like cooking academe I do think they need to have less stuff that<br />You have to buy.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|Fun movie, good cast, great gadgets, thin script, suspect acting...everything I want in a TV show turned into a movie!

1400069289|5.0|Duhigg does a pretty good job of breaking down the habit loop and providing his readers with actionable advice. No diet book is ever going to work, no self-help book is ever going to help, and no single piece of advice is ever going to transform your life until you face your collection of habits.<br /><br />There are multiple reasons that separates this book from a lot of other self-help guides:<br /><br />1. It's scientifically sound. Not a lot of pseudo-spiritual garbage and new age healing. Citing data-driven research, Duhigg looks at how unthinking and automatic behavior culminates in the decisions we make in life. He uses research to explain why habits form in the first place and how we can change them and transform ourselves. While the book is scientifically-based, its not dry or cold. He also respects people's religious beliefs and shows how belief and faith are ultimately responsible for transformation, although that belief doesn't necessarily have to be in a supernatural god. He also provides evidence and research that provide insight into why belief is so important to habit reconfiguration.<br /><br />2. This isn't a quick fix guide. Any book selling quick fixes is a sham. Habit change takes time and a lot of emotionally painful soul-searching. It means facing uncomfortable facts even if those facts lead to self-criticism. But once those ugly truths are acknowledged, the book provides a guide to change those habits and every day of success increases one's optimism and self confidence.<br /><br />3. Most things in life are out of our control. The events in our lives, how people take us in, who we get to meet, to some degree our professional success, opportunities in life, etc, the the one thing that can be in your control is your own mind and willpower, Duhigg provides the instruction manual to your mind. A practical guide to mental programming and training. So by training and controlling ourselves we can be better prepared to react in the best way to opportunities that present themselves and the people we come across.<br /><br />Seize control of your mind and body. While you can do it on your own, this book/guide provides a decade worth of wisdom to help you get ahead of your habits.<br /><br />One of the first habits I changed was my nail-biting habit. I haven't clipped my nails in decades and my fingers were always bleeding. After learning about habits loops, it took me a few weeks to finally stop and actually see my fingers look healthy and my nails growing. Whenever I feel that things are hopeless, I look at my nails and realize that things can change, as silly as that sounds, it give me more optimism in life.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Of the many hidden object games, I found this one was among the top. It is fast,  very touch responsive and not slow on Hint recharges. Nice gaming path and not overly redundent.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|You just HAVE to see the current one.(THIRD one.) Everything in this one is TOO GREAT for words. Sets are REALLY GREAT!
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read in my life!!!!!! Full of action and much suspense. If you killed the Hunger Games, then you will love this book. I give it 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0034DGPEU|3.0|the book had a decent story. The evil throughout the book & especially at theend of the book was  alittle unnerving
1423140591|5.0|This being the second book in this series has been an exciting and was hard to put down. Recommended for the lover of this author.
B003MS0UHU|4.0|...but still pretty good. My kids really enjoyed this film, especially the shenanigans of Sid the sloth. Awesome animation, as well.
B00454U1NS|5.0|it was a birthday gift to my daughter and she loved it. She said that she didn't have any of this singers discs.
B003Z39G0O|4.0|Gave this out as a gift and she loved it.  Her only complaint was a couple of songs were not on it.  Other than that perfect!!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|If you love books, you will love The Thirteenth Tale.  Stylistically, it's the missing link between the 18th and 21st centuries, and a very well-written mystery. I LOVED this book!!!
B001D52XO2|5.0|I am a Nina Simone newbie.  I have heard about her and decided to purchase this collection.  I am a convert!  I absolutely love it and I highly recommend it!
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|The best Robin Hood movie ever made is the Daffy Duck version followed by Flynn' version. The extra features are wonderful. Delivery was prompt so i recommend the supplier.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|It's a great movie for kids and adults who don't mind watching movies like PE. It has a great holiday message :)
B0084I9QIW|5.0|What can one say about the the King of Pop?  Anyone who has seen this guy perform is quite simply blown away at the magnitude of the show.  The singing, dancing, stage props, glitter and glitz is overwhelming, and that's almost an understatement.  He is simply the best, and maybe the best of all time!
0307720950|2.0|I ve red 2 books of C.Anderson and, was not impressed at all.<br />He is good story teller and it's nice reading to have a fun.<br />Indeed, I was expecting his deeper phychological researched and new scientific and experienced visions but it's always stay very \\"superfacial talk\\".<br />These book give a small idea to change & shift yr  though but nothing to be inspired to start your real new business.<br />To start \\"new free business\\" or \\"revoltionally industrial design makers\\",,,, it's not enough just to change yr fixed vision. We need more precise thinking processes. Andersan shows some examples like succesul story of new venture businesses each chapter but it's so far from our real situations & nothing new I found when I red on DEC 2012.  I think the world, specially around internet business, is changing too fast, and  Honestly, This book is not for the person who's looking for practical informations to bind yr idea and realisation. Sory, just 2 stars.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is fun. I love how there's a coin regen and how you can sell your prizes for coins. this game is awesome. five stars.
B009AMAM9S|5.0|I would like to thank all of the investors who took a chance and invested in this movie! It is pure brilliance! The acting was phenomenal! I watched this movie twice and picked up so much more the second time. This is a movie that gets better and better and more profound the more you watch it! Hidden treasures engulf it! It is one of those movies you show others who have open minds to the mysteries of life! And if one has intuition, dreams that come true, has felt déjà vu, believes in \\"connection,\\" or just has an inner knowing that the fact that we live at all is a miracle, this movie is for you!<br /><br />If you are a Rumi fan, and feel connected to his quote, \\"The minute I heard my first love story I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along,\\" then you will love love, love this movie!<br /><br />It's so refreshing to watch a movie with such depth! I grew so attached to all of the good guy/gal characters--And it was amazing how well the actors played other characters! They all should receive the highest award for acting. Pure art! A job well done! All of them!<br /><br />Though this film has mild violence compared to most films these days, the only thing I don't like about this movie is the gore. Do I need to have an image of a guy's throat being slashed or the blood instantly splattered from a fallen man? Do I truly need an image like that in my consciousness? I would love it if I could purchase movies that have all the gore, violence, and sex edited out. That would be perfect! Then I could really focus on the message- if there is indeed a profound message in most of today's movies. However, this movie is so incredible, that I am willing to overlook the unnecessary gore.  The stories, brilliant acting of true, true actors/actresses, effects, and music makes it SOOO WORTH!<br /><br />I expect to see many Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards given from this film.<br /><br />Thank you for all who believed in it enough to bring it to the world! º It made this person, and many of my friends who have seen it, very happy and inspired!
075669812X|3.0|not overly impressed, although my son seems to like it.  Couldn't find something closer to what he really wanted at the right price.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great, challenging, fun, addictive. I've enjoyed games by this developer in the past, and this is one of my favorites. Great graphics, fun cut scenes...
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie was a mix between Glee and Bridesmaids and maybe a little bit of the Breakfast club, which is referenced. If you enjoy those things you will enjoy this.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|PRETTY SAD AT TIMES, BUT A MUST SEE TO APPRECIATE WHAT MEN AT WAR AND THERE ANIMALS MUST ENDURE.  DONT MISS IT.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|I found this movie 15 years ago and fell in love with it.  I have it in VHS thought I would like it also in DVD so I ordered it.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Not a big network TV viewer but stumbled on this series over the holidays. My entire family has enjoyed it (husband and 3 teens)... A little something for everyone.  We purchased via Amazon Prime so we can watch as a family or on individual devices. We are on Season 4!
B00333NCTM|5.0|I have been a Ozzy fan since I was just a kid, and watched The Osbournes right along with everyone else. So I couldn't wait to read this, it is written in such a way that I could hear his voice while reading it. He seemed to hold back nothing, in fact I am shocked that he survived it at all. The drugs, the sex, the well Rock and Roll. I was saddened in some ways and laughed in some ways too. He is Ozzy through and through. And I pray that he continues in his sobriety. It would be shame to lose someone with such a tender heart.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Great read, finished in 3 days. Suspenseful, great characters, and an ending that blew me away. If you like Flynn, you won't be disappointed.
B00931JMRE|5.0|If you like ZZ Top, You wil love this.  It is ZZ at their finest.  Can't get enough of it!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Babe is one of the rare films I could watch over and over, and it's certainly among my top ten favorites.  It's funny, it's heart-breaking, and it's inspiring.  These may seem like odd descriptions considering this is a film about a talking pig.  But it's so much more than that.  Babe, the pig, is purchased as a baby by a farmer, while his mother and siblings meet the unfortunate fate of most pigs.<br /><br />As the sole pig on the farm, Babe struggles for acceptance and is \\"adopted\\" by a dog who is mothering her own pups.  Yes, all the animals talk, and the voice acting work is excellent.<br /><br />James Cromwell is great as the quiet, proud farmer.  Babe goes to great (and adorable) lengths to please him.  The final scene of the film will either make you cry tears of happiness, stand up and cheer, or a combination of both.<br /><br />Whether you're an adult who hasn't seen this film, or you'd like a movie to watch with your children, Babe is a must see.
0061120081|5.0|I am sure others have said it more eloquently than I can hope to accomplish, but when I love a book this much I can not help but try to say why. Everyone loves different books for different reasons, and I loved this one because of the way it places you in a child's mind. A child who's mind is being stretched by the things going on around her, a mind that is struggling to make sense of the world. How on earth does Harper Lee capture us with a story about a lazy small town? How does she fascinate us with the everyday? I think that the voice that tells her story is the magic key. Scout doesn't have any prejudices yet; she is being molded by those around her. She argues with them and puzzles about them and finally makes up her mind about them. She carefully watches all that is happening, and though she only discerns half of it, the older reader can pick up on all the rest. Sometimes, though, Scout is the wiser. She reaches straight through to ways of seeing things we would have never found, and says things we never would have dared to say, because we understand all the implications, but she does not.<br /><br />I was reluctant to read this book, I must admit. I mean, the title doesn't sound all that appealing, even if you know it isn't really about killing mockingbirds. In fact, I think that made it even worse, because then I asked, \\"Well then, what is it about?\\" and the back of the book (I have the Warner Books edition) didn't tell me much, and all my Mom said was, \\"It's about prejudices in the south.\\" Well, I felt I had already read enough about that, but the more books I read with that all-encompassing description, the more I find that there is more to that topic than I ever imagined. We are a very diverse people, on this planet, and we all seem to have a different way of looking at things, a different way of saying things, a different community of thought that shapes us. For another thing, this book is about more than one kind of prejudice, so even if, after that, you still feel that you have read plenty of material on black discrimination, that's still no excuse to not read this book. History books tell you the story from the point of politicians. This tells you the story from the point of the people who lived during that time in their own small town, only distantly affected by those all-important matters. It tells you what people thought back then, which is every bit as important, I believe, as the events themselves.<br /><br />I can understand the vague descriptions on the book covers. I'm not sure that I could do better. I also understand why everyone says you should read it, and I heartily agree with them. You really should not miss out on this one. I don't think you need a big study guide to accompany it; if the author thought it needed that, she would have written one herself. Just sit down in a comfortable spot and read it. That's what Lee intended. That's how you'll enjoy it the most. When you're done, see if your view of things hasn't changed just a little bit. Maybe you'll smile every time you see a mockingbird. Maybe you'll stop and think every time too. That's what I do. I hope you do too.ou still feel that you have read plenty of material on black discrimination, that's still no excuse to not read this book.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I purchased the Godfather blu-ray trilogy for the ridiculously low price of $25.  I intended to give this to a relative as a gift, but when I had it in my hands, I had to keep it.  The film transfer to blu-ray is excellent, and all of the special features in this collection are a great bonus.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|It is a great game but the only issue is if u have kids  and they want to get a stove or something then you have to earn a certain amount of  coins to have one so if you don't then the game will ask if you want to buy more with real money and some kids end up doing this
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful. Easy to get lost in this fantastic historical series .you get involved in the characters , feeling their joy and pain.
0812984412|5.0|I purchased this book because I saw the movie and loved it. I enjoyed the book, but I know that it is definitely not for everyone. For those looking at other editions of the book, it doesn't really matter which one you buy because the \\"new afterword\\" that comes with the movie tie-in edition is only two or three pages long.<br /><br />I was struggling to get through the first half, especially the Robert Frobisher section, but the second half is an absolute dream. In my mind, the book was written like dominos: the first half was setting up all of the dominos painstakingly, but the second half is tipping them over and watching everything unravel. The second half is very fast and very rewarding. Highly recommended!
B003MC5N28|1.0|i dont think I've ever read a book this bad. it is very disturbing. i mean, who thinks of killing babies as a normal thing in any situation ?! not to be a prude but the whole bathing thing is just gross . it's also the worst ending I've ever read. this book is sooooo boring! i had to read it for school and i almost fell asleep reading it and i never do that. don't read this book. don't look at it. don't think about it. you would seriously regret it. i would give it negative stars if i could.<br />XOXO HR Cali

B0054R6BFM|5.0|My English teacher brought this book up in class. I decided to start reading it during Christmas break. It's absolutely a great book for teens and adults!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|love pendergast! we need a movie. As with all other preston/child books I couldn't put it down. Love the new storyline and how can't wait to see how they continue the pendergast adventure.
B005I4JG80|3.0|As a new parent I was very interested in reading this book.  It was an amusing read, but I felt like the writing was a little disorganized and it was a cross between a parenting manual and personal stories.  I guess I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  It was an entertaining quick read.  Nothing to rave about, but a perfect read for a plane ride.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books I've read so far and I can't wait to start the second book! It can only get better from here!
1451695195|5.0|Well written. Very interesting.  I read it in one sitting.  Could not put it down. Nice to have a book like that one occasionally.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Good for all ages for mindless but active play time.  Spend way too much time on this one, of course
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game rocks it's so much fun and so addicting I can play it for hours and hours I love this game and you will to!!!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I wasn't sure the kids would like this one, but they were engrossed in it, trying to perfect their scores.  Some songs are definitely  more challenging!
B007ATNHLI|5.0|Fast shipping to house, great movie! Has all the action and comedy you need in a movie plus will smith is a great actor
1402775458|1.0|the price tag was stuck on the front cover of the dust jacket. I could not peel it, scrape it or wash it off. I sent an email to mediamoguls as the insert directed:<br />&#34;stupid stupid price labels won't come off I hope you didn't pay a lot for them because they don't come off and ruin the jacket stupid stupid labels<br />Yes I am angry<br />Did I mention<br />IT'S STUPID TO USE STICKY LABELS THAT RUIN THE JACKET&#34;<br /><br />I received the following reply:<br />&#34;Those were put on by the manufacturer every single book in every single box had that label.. Funny you should mention that it annoys us as well hopefully it will come off without any difficulty I am sorry for the inconvenience happy holidays&#34;<br /><br />Which to me is an offensive reply, no action would be taken and it is my problem, something I did wrong, that made the problem. Not that anyone was going to see how to get the label off, just &#34;go tell someone who gives a damn&#34;.<br /><br />These guys are terrible
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie is mindless, raunch fun! Definitely not one for the whole family.  But, if you're looking for something to pass the time, this is hilarious!
B0091LS07E|5.0|This is my first time listening to Alicia Keys and do enjoy her voice.  I bought the album for the cut &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; and liked the &#34;other&#34; version of the same song better.  Yes, I would buy more of her albums
B007SYWFRM|4.0|good game, easy to play, no money needed if u wait to finish breeding.  cute graphics just like movie but you have to read dialogue.
B007CKNX28|4.0|It's no White Stripes, but few things are, and I personally enjoyed Consolers of the Lonely (Raconteurs) a lot more. This album has a lot more piano and soft drums than hard rock. You'll still get occasional classic Jack White guitar riffs, but none of these songs made me feel like \\"Man, if I listen to this while driving, it'll make me get a speeding ticket!\\" like Icky Thump or Fell in Love with a Girl. Still a good album with unique lyrics. I thought the middle tracks (Weep Themselves To Sleep, I'm Shakin', and Trash Tongue Talker) were the most enjoyable. Take Me With You When You Go made me think I was listening to something at a county fair, and then mid-song it gets more amped up.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent book! Well written!! I had a hard time putting this book down. From the beginning the author has you hooked!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|It was one of Follett's earlier books and I loved it. I started from the newer and worked back- they are all wonderful.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Well-done movie about a healthy d/s relationship, and how beneficial it can be to the right type of people. I really enjoyed it, and I appreciated seeing a non-mainstream relationship being represented without all the darkness and &#34;wrongness&#34; that the movies usually attribute to it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great book! Can't wait to read the second one! Not what I expected....but was happily surprised. It's a must read.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I bought this for my son who owns a xbox system.  He says it works and it is lots of fun.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Too slow going. The excitement from The Lion just wasn't there.<br />I did like the plot, but didn't like the read
B007HJ8LOE|5.0|This film is just timeless it's one of those movies that you put on and get transported to another time and place and just remember every aspect of the scenes and the lines. The story is so heartfelt about Love for family and of course the Love you left behind that you cannot ever forget. THIS IS one of those films that will remain in your brain and heart forever. YOu will not regret getting this movie!!
B00APUYWYA|2.0|So bad it was remotely entertaining to laugh at! Would not recommend wasting time or money. Cannot believe people were seriously stating that they watched this movie several cult-like times! If I heard one more nasal singer .....
B008ASLNN2|5.0|The first one was great but these films just get better and better. Law and Downey Jr. are such a great team together they were made to play these roles. This film has an awesome plot and action like never before.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Bought this used and it came quickly in pretty good condition. It works great, and does everything it is supposed to. Just make sure you don't get any of those huge 256MB cards - they don't work at all, and corrupt saved games. The classic official cards are the way to go.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|This was a hot film Channing Tatum is just a dream. I was NOT crazy at all about matthew mcconaughey's role at all he looked too washed up and was trying WAYYYY to hard. This is an awesome movie for the ladies real fun!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it. It is as good as looking it up on my desktop and since I can't take my desktop with me, this works just fine.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked this game. The puzzles were fun and it actually had quite a fascinating story line. It was definitely fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Even though this book was very detailed (sexually), the plot is very interesting! Very exceptional book! I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next two books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. Big buttons. Simple enough for my six year old to mess around with. Best of all, it's free!
B000YHG72E|1.0|I tried to download the movie but it would not download.  I could not play it directly either.  Did not like.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|i totally love the harry potter movies! I'm so glad i've got the special edition to add to my collection.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I am aware that this review will make me sound like a hippie but oh well. I love this movie so much because it shows a lot about human nature and it's reaction to disregard something that it deems as unnecessary, like the knowledge that (in this movie) Greenhouse gases escaping the Antarctic icecaps, caused the pre-historic world to go into an ice age to re-correct nature's imbalance and unless something is done LONG-term wise, it will likely happen again. And in this movie it certainly does. It's kind of chilling to watch this movie because there are certain items that we are facing ourselves, like the depletion of the ozone layer and a record high of greenhouse gases ever accounted for and a very strange weather pattern seen across the world. Art imitates life, so to an extent from watching the movie and knowing about things happening in reality that are main focal points for the movie, it's scary and hopefully art won't imitate life or vis versa.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|i totally love the harry potter movies! I'm so glad i've got the final chapter to add to my collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really liked this book and look forward the the rest.  I can also now watch the first movie.  2 thumbs up!
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|since i loved the movie at first sight, i just HAD to get the soundtrack and i love the music too!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I loved the musical and listening to the soundtrack makes me feel like I am sitting in the theater watching it over again!  The movie helped clarify some of the songs that I had a difficult time understanding in the musical itself.  The songs sung by the actors in the movie were not quite so operatic, thus helped me to make out the words bringing more understanding and meaning to the musical itself.  Anne Hathaway did a remarkable job hitting all the notes!  Anyway, the soundtrack is amazing and you will enjoy it if you enjoyed the movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wasn't a fan of The Notebook movie so I was reluctant to read this book when it popped up in my recommended book list. I was very surprised that I loved this. It was so well written and I couldn't put it down. I am now planning on reading more of Nicholas Sparks books.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this app! It's so much fun and challenging too! I actually hide it from my kids so I get to play all of it for now :)
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|The kids love Christmas gifted they love the movie they Lenin's in movie the love dances and music in. Movie movie so cute
B007SGLZH6|4.0|It explains very well on a step by step, for a homemade bread, from basic to complex. Includes &#34;pearls&#34; for a great bread and pizza that probably someone else would not tell you. At times, repetitive for certain issues, such as weight over volume, but certainly useful. From all the books i have checked, this is the one I found the most suitable for beginners as well for advanced amateur bakers.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Love I love story the kids had secret about the secret going gardenwas lock they key this help over come healylth to a point
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|Soundtrack is somewhat disappointing. Doesn't have the depth or intensity of the songs in the movie. Feels like something is missing when I listen to it.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|i enjoy playing this game when i just need a moment to take my mind off of the daily grind.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|New concept into MIB (Back to the future).  More adult language and humor, but still  a family movie.  Good show.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia day books keep me turning the pages !! It was awesome<br />Reading ! I will dead be downloading more
B0063IH60K|5.0|To be honest I chose this game because it was free, but I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and quality of the action.<br />I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing  solitaire.
B0033AGPF8|1.0|I wanted the original Jimi Hendirix LP, so it arrived, brand new to open<br />I played on my brand new player, and it keep jumping and loosing parts of several tracks.<br />I am really disappointed,and definitely wouldn't reccomend this item, even if it looks like new, the audio is really bad
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I bought this book for $2 on sale and was very skeptical.  It was a quick read and very entertaining.  Going to see if there is a sequel and buy it even if it is full price
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's not bad but it's not good. I for one haven't had problems previously stated by others. News feed loads regularly but every now and then the app has to force close.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is now on my list of top 10 all time favorite novels. It was incredible. I read the entire thing in one day because I couldn't stop. I kept me on edge and had a fantastic ending that didn't leave me disappointed or wondering. I don't think the content should be advertised as 17+ because I'm 16 and being close to the main character's age enabled me to connect with her and understand her, which I feel would be harder for someone who is past their high school years. Some of the situations are strikingly realistic and offer a beneficial new perspective to young readers. I think it was beautifully written and has fantastic underlying messages. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an emotional and thought provoking story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing! Simply amazing and inspiring! Reminds me of things i experience and makes me have a different outlook on life.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing<br />Out of this world<br />I would read this multiple times<br />Best book ever since the first book<br />5 stars
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is the best book I've read In a long time .it's the type of book that makes you think about life. I find myself in Charlie plenty of times while reading . On the out side he's seems like a typical wallflower but getting into his head you learn that he is so much more. Everyone one should read this especially young adults.
B005HS00NW|4.0|I don't usually go in for this sort of music, but it was well done! This Old Prog enjoyed it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read!!! I can't wait for the next book to come out!! Simply awesome!!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved book two! Unexpected ending and I can't wait to start on three! Suspenseful to the point you won't want to put it down!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|haven't used it much but at least it gets me to google search engine quickly.  nice feature overall I guess
B000HEWEJO|5.0|great acting and timeless situation. fun and emotional. I am pleased to finally own it. now can be watched on my schedule.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Fantastic!  What would the general public do without Facebook?  Can even catch up while laying in bed in a dark rom
B008CLI4N4|2.0|This edition was missing the family tree insert, which my daughter really wanted.  The holder was there, but empty.  This is a rating on the packaging, only.
B004XANKVO|4.0|I was in search of something to carry my camera equipment that wasn't obviously a camera bag and was actually looking for a messenger-style style bag (ie, something like [[ASIN:B00524TRV2 Timbuk2 Classic Messenger Bag]]).  This bag caught my eye while I was shopping for a camera insert ([[ASIN:B0047P0QLC BBP DSLR Camera Insert, Make Your Own Camera Bag - Orange]]) and I liked the idea of carry a whole lot more than just my camera (such as my laptop and a tablet).<br /><br />This backpack is very well-built and very SPACIOUS.  I am able to fit my laptop (13\\" MBP or work 13\\" dell laptop) + my 10\\" Toshiba Thrive in a soft-cover sleeve + the aforementioned camera insert (dSLR with medium zoom lens + 50 mm lens + external flash + battery chargers + cables) and still have A LOT of space left over for clothing to cover a weekend trip.<br /><br />The  crush-proof SafeZone is a good idea, but I am a bit wary about putting sunglasses that do not fold relatively flat in there.  I have put my ipod & cell phone in there with no worries.<br /><br />The Shove-It pocket is a great idea and is reminiscent of an old Trek Cycling backpack i had that had a similar mesh carryall for holding either my bicycle helmet or for a light jacket.  The compression straps are smart, but seem a bit difficult to slide (maybe that's good:  it keeps things from loosening up too easily and jiggling around!).<br /><br />Some features I wish this bag had and other thoughts:<br />-  compression straps:  this bag has a tremendous amount of capacity. When this is full it sticks out and it is easy to misjudge how much space you have behind you.  When it's not full, it STILL sticks out because there's nothing pulling it in.  I packed this Thule similar for a 4-night vacation and found that this bag really does NOT fit under the seat in front and is better stored in the overhead bin in larger planes.  Might be troublesome in planes with smaller bins.  If there were compression straps, i think i could have gotten it to fit underneath the seat.<br />-  lockable zippers:  the zippers are of very high quality and some have a little extra tag in the metal that make you think you can put a small padlock when joined with the 2nd zipper (if double-zipper) or some anchor point when the zipper is fully closed.  But this does not exist.  The most you can do is use an elastic loop to slightly deter pick-pocketers, but it is not too secure<br />-  waist/hip strap-belt:  I think that this bag is on the larger side (I'm 5'10\\" of medium-build) and if you are like me and prefer to fill it up \\"just because\\", ergonomics will dictate transferring some weight off your shoulders/back and onto your hips, but you can't (no waist strap).  The backpack straps does have a chest strap and are very comfortable, but having a waist strap would help a lot!<br /><br />Overall:<br />-  Very spacious bag, maybe too spacious; decent amount of accessory pockets (mesh and zippered)<br />-  no worries in packing your electronics and a couple days clothing<br />-  despite my slight grumbling above, i'm very happy with the purchase and the features in this backpack.  Really, closer to 4.5 out of 5 stars.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Typical John Grisham...captivating, you don't want to put it down.  I keep thinking it is going to end, but it keeps going.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is a lot of fun to read from the very first paragraph.  I think it strikes a nice balance between the human story of the astronaut and also some realistic science that I found myself more than a few times researching on google and wikipedia as the story progressed.  Also at the price of 0.99$ I thought it was very good value and I would have been prepared to pay quite a lot more.  Anybody that likes science and a good survival yarn will love this book and I highly recommend it.
B009LE7AU4|5.0|First let me say I am a music industry being a long standing member of AES, NARAS and holding a R.A.S.A.D. (there has got to be a better word out there than \\"veteran\\") person, but that has not bearing on my review of \\"In the Pleasure Groove Deluxe: Love, Death, and Duran Duran\\". Even though I did  shell out the money for the limited edition signed copy there was a very jaded part of me ready to (not hate) but deeply dislike this book. Mr. Taylor did earn points right off the bat with refusing to \\"name and shame\\" which so many people do these days. Mr. Taylor used his wit, wisdom and terrific story telling to shift units, I mean to sell books.<br /><br />This is the first audio book I have ever bought (normally I rented them from the central library downtown) so in the evening I would pop in a disc (I will get to the pics and video at some point but it's not a priority for me) and put my on Sennheizers. The LAST thing I want to do at the end of the day is read more. The audio book makes all the difference in the world having the author act out the inflections and accents to convey the emotion of the story he is telling. At times I found myself literally gasping in horror - the teacher making everyone look at \\"Nigel\\". That was so wrong in so many ways. And at other times laughing out loud - when he told sting to go [censored]. The years later did a TOTP show with him and Mr. Taylor thought if he should say admit it was him back in Birmingham. Although Birmingham can be a rough crowd to please even in today - for any band.<br /><br />There was also some light shed on his relationships with other members of Duran. One of which I have to admit I secretly referring to one of them as the \\"Dr. Evil of Pop\\". Some people I guess rub you the wrong way and you are never going to really like them. But Roger Taylor he said is one of the nicest people who has zero drama around him. I sincerely wish there were more Roger Taylors in the world.<br /><br />Overall Mr. Taylor did a stellar job in telling his life's story and he did it with charm, grace, panache and most appreciated humor. He did a rare thing - he made his stories interesting and not just a rehashing of stories already told.  And he did it without dragging anyone through the mud - in the music industry mud is easily found. The only sadness I experienced is when it ended, and unlike Downton Abbey, there isn't another season, not another chapter to listen to. So we'll just have to watch and see what else unfolds in the story of Mr. Taylor and Duran. I just wish people would stop saying \\"it's been over 32 years since you formed Duran...\\" ugh - it's the only time in life I feel old.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great  Fantastic way to play solitaire although I don't quite know how to play the multi player game.  Will keep trying

B006LSZECO|5.0|&#34;Gone Girl&#34; by Gillian Flynn is an excellent mystery, a real page turner. I felt I was reading an &#34;onion&#34; with different layers peeled off. You might be up all night.
B000002I4W|5.0|I literally hadn't played this CD from my 2,000+ CD collection in ages, and recently I read an article somewhere about the lasting legacy of Ornette Coleman, which made me revisit this CD (and now I've been playing it a lot again).<br /><br />\\"The Shape of Jazz to Come\\" (1959 release; 6 tracks; 38 min.) starts off with the immediate now-classic \\"Lonely Woman\\", in which we get introduced to the 4 piece band, adding Don Cherry on cornet, and the rhythm section of Charlie Haden on bass and Bill Higgins on drums. Check out Haden's amazing bass work on track 2 \\"Eventually\\". Track 3 (the closing number on the original vinyl album's A side) is the 9 min. \\"Peace\\", a slower number with lots of intrecate interplay between Coleman and Cherry. Side B starts off with \\"Focus on Sanity\\" which eventually leads to a great drum solo from Higgins. \\"Congeniality\\" is another classic, starting off with a bass solo from Haden but eventually leading into all four members contributing, at times furiously. \\"Chronology\\" cops off this fantastic album. Please note that the CD contains the original outstanding and insightful liner notes from Martin Williams of the Jazz Review.<br /><br />In all, what an album! It is almost beyond belief that this was recorded more than 50 years ago (and if memory serves me right, in a matter of days). This album clearly stand the test of time. More so, any discussion of jazz's avant-garde should rightfully start here. For jazz fans alike, or any buff of music history, \\"The Shape of Jazz to Come\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|We thought this was going to be just another soap opera, albeit British; but, after only episode, we are totally addicted.  We watched all of Seasons 1 and 2 in just a few days and are now eagerly waiting for the beginning of Season 3!
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|I found this movie to be a very fast action type of movie. I did not recognize the female lead at all but I still enjoyed the movie.

B008ELUEQC|5.0|Merry Christmas, Baby  by Rod Stewart  I'm a Rod Stewart fan and it was typical Rod Stewart, how could you not love it
B001Q2ZHZE|4.0|Watching it, without hindsight prior to waching, and little interest now after watching it, I never understood what was going on. Fortunately not important for me. I watch the acting, register the visual effect (butterfly or not). And the three kids, at 7, and 13, did it for me. The violent kid, above all. What a performance! And that's what my stars are for.
B00125JP1C|4.0|If you are looking for action then you will get your fill with this one but don't be expecting anything serious or you will be disappointed
B003DNN0L2|5.0|I love Wes Anderson movies because they refuse to be anything other than life, which is comic and tragic at the same time.  This is no genius statement, obviously, but it doesn't show up in a lot of movies, except classics, which I'd rate this one.<br /><br />I haven't read through all the other reviews, but I'm sure you know the plot and all that.  I watched it to see if I could use it for a class I'm teaching, looking for that \\"theme\\" you have to hit when you're a teacher in this climate.  (Fun is not allowed in the college classroom.)  A grand theme is there.  I hate looking for metaphors in literature, a fool's game, but when hit on the head, well, and done with a very insistent feather, a metaphor doesn't hurt.<br /><br />The animals are the underclass, which we get all along, because they wind up way, way underground, trying to just get by, trying to make it with no-income jobs, finally living in the sewers that are ruled by the white rich uberclass.  But of course the underclass survives by theft and pure glee at the prospect of living.  Through scavenging various cultures.  And most of all, through love and companionship.  The movie is as fun and engaging and technically wonderful as everyone says it is, but I do love the subtext a whole lot.  It is all true for us in the lower 98, percentile, that is.<br /><br />Oh, and I about fell down when I saw that the voice of the Rabbit is Mario Batali.  He is of course an Iron Chef, and one who specializes in cooking, among much else, rabbit.  Irony is not dead.  It just smells funny.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A wonderful book again from Colleen Hoover.  I love Sky and Holder and reading about how they fall in love, the story behind them and how they overcome it all because of each other.  Sky and Holder are instantly drawn to each other and they only figure out why later on.  The tragic event that happens to Sky doesn't define everything about her and it's a story of love and survival.  I can't wait to read more books from the talented Colleen Hoover.  Her other books Slammed and Point of No Retreat are just as equally well written and great books!  Enjoy...I couldn't put it down!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game &quot; 101 in 1 games&quot; is very fun to play. blab blab blab blab blab blab blab blab.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|This movie was exceptional; the camera work excellent; the actors played their parts with aplomb; the music set a wonderful tone for the film; even the color hues lent to the overall emotional sense; there is no question of the intelligence of the film and all the nuances it referenced; the story carried with it just enough of the foray into the past, and in such a remarkable way, that one excepts the phenomenon with ease. The only thing this move requires of its audience, in order to enjoy its delectation's of badinage and lack of bromidic nonsense, is the intelligence to enjoy it. While this was not the old, &#34;boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl,&#34; plot, one enjoys that the boy does not get stuck with a modern day 'femme fatale' and moves on to the freedom to enjoy the path of his heart's desire ... mayhaps, that dream we all long to accomplish, but never seem to have the opportunity to bring to fruition, and simply go about our lives with a writer's, poet's, actor's, musician's, etc., manque ... however, in this film, we can vicariously enjoy the protagonist's move into the realm of his optimistic, new life.............
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the story line, what I could see of it, why does it buffer every 5 seconds?  I haven't been able to go onto #2 because of the amount of buffering, I might as well by the DVD
B000W93CHC|5.0|Book in perfect condition and, once started, hard to put down. What seems to be a realistic story about the cathedral and the people whose story began in &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;.  Story sounds dry but it's not!  Ken Follett writes a good story!
B005LAIGRS|5.0|What can I say other than it was definitely action filled.  Once the &#34;chase&#34; was on, literally on the edge of your seat.  Really happy we purchased the movie.
B005LAII8K|1.0|I assure you that I'm not ruining it for you by saying the ending is as stupid as one could possibly imagine. It's really a film that leaves you wondering, through the whole thing, how it's going to turn out. Answer: It turns out really really stupid, as in \\"Man, whoever wrote this was an idiot\\" stupid. Not just disappointing. I mean ... why did this get to production stupid? How many Hollywood big-shots does it take to be really really stupid stupid. It's not a \\"smart but confusing\\" sci-fi film as the promoters describe it. It's confusing because it's wrong ... illogically wrong. The ending does not actually make any logical sense at all. No, that's not what would happen. It's just stupid.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This was also very good.  But I thought it dragged a little until the action at the end.  I have read many of his books and they are all excellent.
1451629192|1.0|I actually bought this book by mistake (I hit the wrong button on the Kindle). I had no idea what it was or who the author was--only that it was the #1 seller on Kindle which probably means it is also destined for the New York Times list of bestsellers. Since I bought it, I began reading and learned that Jaycee Dugard is that woman who was in the news a short time ago, having been kidnapped at 11 and kept as a kind of sex slave for 18 years. I read only the first couple of chapters. When she began to describe the sexual abuse she was subjected to, I immediately stopped reading. Somewhere it seemed to cross a line that I found quite literally sickening. I learned that you're actually able to return a Kindle book once you've bought it; I took advantage of the policy.
0525952926|5.0|loved the first  of the trilogy, &#34;Winter of the World was just a good. and looking forward to the third.<br />Ken Follett is a great story teller

1439181780|1.0|Let's start with a trick question. If I were to ask you what connects Lance Armstrong to Arnold Schwarzenegger, how would you respond? If you mumbled something witty about steroids,\\" I'm afraid you'd be wrong. According to Rhonda Byrne, what connects these two men is that they both harnessed the law of attraction in order to bring about their wildest dreams. They wanted money and fame and success, and wanted it so much that the universe delivered it to them (and not in the shape of a syringe, apparently).<br /><br />In June of 2007 I wrote a review of Byrne's The Secret and posted it at this blog. Three years later it remains one of the most-viewed pages, still racking up thousands of page views per month. The book has sold millions of copies and has been translated into 46 languages. It is a worldwide bestseller and one that has spawned many imitators.<br /><br />The Secret is an introduction to the law of attraction. The law of attraction, which Byrne says is the most powerful law in the universe, states that people experience the logical manifestations of their predominant thoughts, feelings, and words. The law says that your thoughts become things so that your thoughts shape the world around you. You shape your own life and destiny through the power of your mind. The positive things in your life appear through your positive thoughts and feelings and the negative things in your life appear through your negative thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />The Power is the just-released 2010 follow-up and one that immediately raced to the top of the New York Times list of bestsellers. The problems with the book are too many to catalog in a short review. It is almost mind-boggling how much unsubstantiated and blatantly contradictory nonsense Byrne manages to pack into just 250 pages, many of which contain little more than pictures and out-of-context quotes (from people as diverse as Gandhi and Jesus, Albert Einstein and Dietrich Bonhoeffer).<br /><br />The book apparently began with a great discovery. Byrne's great discovery was that in order to receive everything you want, you need to feel love for it. Hence love is the theme of this book. The power behind the law of attraction, it seems, is love. The logic here is a little bit opaque but I think Byrne means to say that the law of attraction is the most powerful law in the universe and love is the most powerful force since it is the force that motivates attraction. When you love something, you draw it to yourself through a kind of universal magnetism. Hence she can say, \\"Everything you want to be, do, or have comes from love ... The positive force of love can create anything good, increase the good things, and change anything negative in your life.\\"<br /><br />Did you catch that, young Skywalker? It's pretty simple--we are all magnets and we draw to ourselves whatever matches our thoughts and feelings. The things we love most are irresistibly drawn to us through a universal law of attraction. It may sound fishy, but it's been championed by the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres before their audiences of millions. And people are lapping this stuff up.<br /><br />So how does this law and the power of love manifest itself in a life? The challenge of a good life is to get yourself to the point where 51% of your feelings are good and are marked by love. At this point things will cascade and all the good that must come your way will soon overwhelm the negative. So \\"to change your life, all you have to do is tip the scales by giving 51 percent love through your good thoughts and good feelings. Once you reach the tipping point of giving more love than negativity, the love that comes back to you then multiplies itself.\\" Want some examples of how this works out? Well, if you help someone who dropped an object in the street, you may then find a parking spot right outside the supermarket door (page 51) or you may do a favor for a friend and then find that your boss gives you complimentarytickets to a sports game (page 51).<br /><br />Much of the book is dedicated to giving instruction on how you can have everything you've ever wanted (which we all know is crucial to true joy and fulfillment, right?). The key is to imagine, to feel and then to receive. First you imagine what it is you want. Whatever it is--a new life, a new wife, never-ending perfect health, an awesome bowler hat--you need to first imagine having it, doing something great with it. Then you are to feel the love for what you're imagining. \\"You must imagine and feel being with your desire,\\" doing things with it, having it, owning it. At this point the force of love will work through the law of attraction and bring it to you. It has to! Your job is just to receive it as it comes to you. \\"Whatever you desire you must want it with all your heart. Desire is love, and unless you have a burning desire in your heart, you will not have enough power to harness the force of love.\\"<br /><br />Awesome, eh? Want it, love it, get it. It couldn't be easier. And she provides lots of stories (and not a shred of evidence) to prove her case.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Byrne spends a good bit of the book discussing the three things people want most: money, love and health. In every case, you can have it all as long as you believe it and love it enough.\\"The only difference between the wealthy people and everyone else is that the wealthy people give more good feelings about money than they do bad feelings. It's as simple as that.\\" Uh huh. Tell that to the child born into poverty or to the person whose wealth was annihilated in a bank failure. \\"You just don't love money enough. It's your fault, don't you know? The love of money is the root of all sorts of joy and peace.\\"<br /><br />There is a large sense in which all of this talk about love and attraction is inherently materialistic, in which it is inherently envious. If I can set my eye upon something and love it, Byrne promises that I will receive it. The universe has decreed that it will be so. And so my task in life becomes looking at all the world has to offer and setting my mind upon those things that I want. I cannot just want it one time, but I must dedicate myself to wanting it until I want it so much that the universe responds. I must live much of my life focusing on those things I feel that I need in order to be happy, those things I feel I must have in order to find significance. Some life.<br /><br />Of course feeling is not enough; I need to actually begin to live like what I want is already mine. So if I want to find myself a new wife (which I don't, by the way), Byrne counsels me to live as if she is already mine. I need to sleep on one side of the bed, not in the middle, I need to leave half the dresser empty so there is room for her clothes, I need to set the table for two (Truly! She actually says this.). Because as I live like it is true, it will come to me. And who cares if I look like the utter fool I am for doing it? She even says that a good way of looking for a job may be to not look at all--just act like you've already got one and one will come your way. I dare you to try that at the unemployment office. \\"Yeah, I stopped looking and started acting like I have one. Rhonda says it's better this way.\\"<br /><br />The section on health is downright comical. Or is it tragic? Is there such thing as a tragicomedy? \\"Do you have more good feelings about health than you have negative feelings about disease? Do you believe in lifelong health more than you believe in the inevitability of disease? If you believe that your body will deteriorate with age and that disease is inevitable, you are giving out that belief, and the law of attraction must return it to you clothed as the circumstances and state of your body and health.\\" Did you know that you can live forever if only you can generate enough love, if only you convince yourself that you're not getting older? She honestly says this. I couldn't make thisstuff up. It's that vapid, that stupid. I couldn't even parody it; it's a parody of itself.<br /><br />This whole book is premised on complete selfishness. According to Byrne I am to go through life constantly generating good feelings about myself so that I can have everything I ever wanted. Whatever makes me happy can be mine if only I feel good about it. How does that leave me living on behalf of others? \\"When I see a person who seems to have a particular need, someone who can't afford to buy something they want, for instance, I send them thoughts of abundance of money.\\" Isn't that kind? \\"Here, have some good feelings about being full; that should help ease your hunger. And good luck with all of your hopes and dreams.\\" Didn't Jesus have something to say about that kind of a person?<br /><br />Where the law of attraction is most sickening is how it plays out in times of grief. What happens when bad things come? We have nowhere to go but introspection; no one to blame but ourselves. We have to look inward and find negativity there. I read recently of the systemic rape in an African nation--thousands of women raped, many of them repeatedly, as soldiers march through their land, are chased out, and return again. It's horrifying and nauseating. And the law of attraction can explain it only by saying that these women brought about their own rape by thinking negative thoughts. They were afraid of rape and therefore they were raped. When the armies of drugged-out, terrorized young boys came marching through their land, these women felt fear and negativity and brought rape upon themselves. Do you really want to believe this? Unbelievably, Byrne even quotes the book of Job as she goes. Job! Didn't she read to the end? How on earth could an honest reading of Job do anything but convince people of the folly of her brand of reasoning.<br /><br />Needless to say, The Power is a bad book. A really bad book. It's so utterly stupid, so unbelievably vapid, that it boggles my mind that anyone could read it and believe it. If you could package foolishness, if you could slap stupidity between two covers, you'd end up with The Power. Read it if you must, but as you do it, you'd better generate some good feelings toward brain cells; you'll need to attract a few to yourself if you're replace all the ones that are sure to die as you give hours of your life to all of this drivel.universe has decreed that it will be so.

055338466X|1.0|Stephen Hawkings' The Grand Design has shot straight to the top of the New York Times list of bestsellers. The book is his atheistic answer to questions like these ones: Why is there a universe--why is there something rather than nothing? Why do we exist? Why are the laws of nature what they are? Did the universe need a designer and creator? Edgar Andrews was kind enough to allow me to post his review of the book. Andrews is author of Who Made God?: Searching for a Theory of Everything, Emeritus Professor of Materials at the University of London and an international expert on the science of large molecules. Which is to say that he is well-suited to write a review of a book like this one. Here is what he says about The Grand Design:<br /><br />Cosmologist Stephen Hawking sold over nine million copies of his book A Brief History of Time. Now, 22 years later, he has co-authored The Grand Design which immediately hit the No.1 spot in the New York Times best-seller list. But the sequel is so inferior to the prequel in intellectual quality that a reviewer in The Times Saturday Review (London, 11 September 2010) writes: `It reads like a stretched magazine article ... there is too much padding and too much recycling of long-stale material... I doubt whether The Grand Design would have been published if Hawking's name were not on the cover'.<br /><br />So why is the new book a runaway best-seller? Because it claims that science makes God redundant. Let's take a closer look at the claims advanced in The Grand Design.<br /><br />Philosophical skulduggery<br />The introduction asserts that `Philosophy is dead' (p.5) and science alone can provide `New answers to the ultimate questions of life' (the book's hubristic sub-title). But the authors then produce their own brand of humanistic philosophy, christen it `science' and base their book upon it.<br /><br />They say; `this book is rooted in the concept of scientific determinism which implies ... that there are no miracles, or exceptions to the laws of nature'. But `scientific determinism' is simply the philosophical assumption that the laws control all events. I argue precisely the opposite in chapter 11 of my own book Who made God? (WMG in further references).<br /><br />Again, in chapter 3, They maintain that `reality' is a construct of our minds -- implying that there is no such thing as objective reality (Irish philosopher Bishop Berkeley had the same idea in 1710 but he wasn't widely believed). They conclude that `there is no picture- or theory-independent concept of reality' and propose what they call `model dependent realism' as a `frame-work with which to interpret modern science' (pp. 42-43). Clearly, an interpretive framework for science cannot be science but belongs in a different category altogether, namely, philosophy.<br /><br />Since the mental models we construct `are the only reality we can know ... It follows then that a well-constructed model creates a reality of its own' (p.172). The problem with this, of course, is that it undermines the very concept of reality. Hawking's `reality' excludes God while my `reality' majors upon God. These two `realities' are mutually exclusive but both (according to Hawking) are equally `real'. This is postmodernism by the back door and it is wholly inimical to science, which depends on there being a genuine reality to investigate.<br /><br />Determinism<br />The authors also embrace another philosophy, namely, scientific determinism. `Though we feel we can choose what we do, our understanding of the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets' (pp.31-32). So we are mindless automatons and everything we do or think is predetermined.<br /><br />The reality is, of course, that biological processes are overwhelmingly `governed' not by physics and chemistry but by structured information, stored on DNA and expressed through the genetic code. It is information which controls the physics and chemistry of the living cell, not the other way round.<br /><br />Furthermore, if our minds are simply by-products of molecular processes in the brain, then all our thoughts are meaningless including the authors' own theories. Thinking atheists such as Bertrand Russell and J. B. S. Haldane long ago recognised and admitted this dilemma explicitly (WMG chapter 16) but Hawking and Mlodinow seem oblivious to it.<br /><br />Chapter 4 is devoted to explaining the `many histories' formulation of quantum theory proposed by Richard Feynman. This is well done except that by ignoring other formulations of quantum theory the authors give the false impression that Feynman's is the only valid approach. This is tendentious because they need Feynman's idea as a springboard for their own multiverse hypothesis. To admit that `many histories' is just one of several equally valid formulations of quantum mechanics would weaken their argument considerably.<br /><br />Mighty M-theory<br />Chapter 5 surveys the development of physics during the past 200 years, including general relativity (which describes the large-scale behaviour of the universe) and quantum mechanics (which describes its microscopic behaviour). Although containing nothing new, this is by far the best part of this book.<br /><br />The chapter concludes, however, with comments on M-theory that rang alarm bells (p.118). In the book's opening chapter, M-theory is no more than `a candidate for the ultimate theory of everything, if indeed one exists', and is `not a theory in the usual sense' but `may offer answers to the question of creation'. Physicist Lee Smolin is doubtful: `... we still do not know what M-theory is, or whether there is any theory deserving of the name' (The Trouble with Physics, Allen Lane 2007, p.146). Indeed, on p.117 the authors themselves admit that `people are still trying to decipher the nature of M-theory, but that may not be possible'.<br /><br />But suddenly on p.118 this intractable mathematical model is somehow transformed into a theory so powerful that its laws are `more fundamental' than the laws of nature and `allow' for `different universes with different apparent laws'. This is a huge leap of atheistic faith.<br /><br />Witches brew<br />The final three chapters rapidly descend into a witches brew of speculation and misinformation, confusingly blended with normal science. It certainly gave me a mental hangover -- and I am no stranger to the territory. It is difficult to discern where science ends and speculation begins, but the key reasoning seem to be as follows.<br /><br />1. The `big bang' model predicts that the universe began life as such a tiny object that quantum theory must be applied to its origin (p.131). But hold on a moment! Quantum theory has only been validated under normal conditions of space, time, pressure, temperature and so on. We cannot know whether it applies to the supposed conditions at the origin of the universe, when space was intensely warped, time was at best fuzzy, and the pressure and temperature both approached infinity. What we do know is that massive objects do not exhibit quantum behaviour. No one can be sure that a new-born universe would obey quantum theory as we know it.<br /><br />2.  `In the early universe all four dimension [of space-time] behave like space' allowing us to `get rid of the problem of time having a beginning' (pp.134-135). But if time and space were equivalent, and time did not begin, then space didn't begin either! The universe was still-born. In fact the authors are appealing to the `no-boundary' model described by Hawking 22 years ago in A Brief History of Time but are economical with the truth. The earlier book makes it clear that the model is valid only in imaginary time, not in real time (see WMG p.121). But here this caveat vanishes and imaginary time is misrepresented as real time.<br /><br />The narrative then descendsinto farce. They claim that `the realisation that time behaves like space ... means that the beginning of the universe was governed by the laws of science and doesn't need to be set in motion by some god' (p.135). So apparently the universe did `begin' after all, but not in time. Confused? Me too.<br /><br />3. Picturing the early universe as a quantum particle (something they themselves describe as `tricky') the authors consider how it might evolve from point (state) A to point (state) B by applying Feynman's sum-over-histories method thus:<br /><br />`[Since we are considering the beginning of the universe] there is no point A, so we add up all the histories that satisfy the no-boundary condition and end at the universe we observe today. In this view the universe appears spontaneously, starting off in every possible way. Most of these correspond to other universes.'<br /><br />But by saying that point A does not exist they assume that the universe springs into existence somewhere between nothing (point A) and the present universe (point B). This tells us nothing about how or why the universe began; simply that it did begin. We knew that already.<br /><br />4. Finally, p.180 does offer an explanation of spontaneous creation. The conservation of energy means that universes can only be created from nothing if their net energy is zero, with negative gravitational energy balancing out the positive energy of matter and radiation. This necessitates that a law of gravity must exist. Because a law of gravity exists it must and will of itself create universes out of nothing (no reasoning given).<br /><br />So gravity is God. Unfortunately the authors have no time to tell us who created gravity (earlier they rule out God because no one could explain who created him). Nor can they tell us why matter and gravity should pop out of nothing, except to argue that `nothing' undergoes quantum fluctuations. However, this requires that (like gravity) the laws of quantum mechanics pre-existed the universe and that `nothing' possesses the properties of normal space, which is part of the created order and cannot be its antecedent.<br /><br />A grand design?
