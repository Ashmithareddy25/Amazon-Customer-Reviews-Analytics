B001EBYM8A|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford are so good in this movie. Two of my families favorite actors come together to create suspense and drama.  Gotta see movie
B008RXYOKY|5.0|i was worried about it at first from all the review i have the new 2013 27 inch i mac and a drobo 2nd gen 4 bay fire wire800. i don't understand what everyone is writing that it don't work! ((((this product work amd works very well))))) no problem and fast love it and people, if u don't know how to use a product say so and dont blame the product , it makes it harder for us to trust the buy.//////highly recommend it
0739322125|5.0|read the book got the tape for my husband to listen to while w travel twist at end surprised him
B0095T3H2U|5.0|What a funning and clever movie.  Not a blatent comedy like Something About Mary.  But very creative and clever lines that make the move funny and entertaining.  Will be watching this one again.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|this book is written way above the intellect of most of the people trying to read  it. i get lost in the terminology. The author seems to purposely flaunt his knowledge and verbage. i deleted it from my kindle.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is even better than the original Temple Run.  My granddaughters (ages 11 and 13) love it!  Hours of fun.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|we think this is one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled.  our holiday isn't complete without it. order it as soon as you can.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|It was hard to set down the book once the story started to pick up. The play between real events and hallucinations makes you want to read more, to find out if anything being said actually happened or if it's just the mind playing tricks. The story is chilling but addicting. Highly recommend it!
B0095P31L6|5.0|The kids enjoy this movie. Price was good, and quality was good. Would purchase more movies like this, although sometimes, I forget that we have them.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|If you are compassionate towards your fellow man and want to see through one mans eyes his mental illness this is the movie to watch....
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|I love foster the people's lyrics, music, and just overall delivery of every single track. they are worth looking into. I hope they keep up this magic
B002KT3XH6|5.0|Great book, ordered more by same author.  Excited to read them. I would recommend everyone to read this book.  Great
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you love this series you already saw these. If you haven't seen these get watching! I'm not a fan of Gore but this story is worth it!!! Addicting!
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|I really like the guitar, orchestra/synth, drums, and the female vocals. But everytime the male vocals (that to me just sound like cookie monster) start up, I just cringe and hope for that section of the music to pass by quickly. It's a shame really, because if it weren't for Cookie Monster, this would probably be one of my favorite albums ever. :(
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a little bit better than the first one because you can zipline. It also has different environments. It's a awesome game.
B00009W0U4|1.0|horrible movie, the story and the acting are horrible.  I wouldnt waste any money or time on this one if i were you.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Too short of a game. It would be nice if it was a bit longer. Had more levels to advance to.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|well, my title pretty much sums up my review of this game.  I got it at a reduced price, which is the only redeeming part of this sorry tale of a bad game.  The graphics are really quite awful and the hints are not interesting.  There is a lot of dialog that seems to get more and more annoying as the game progresses; I got to the point of skipping the chatter and just playing the 'seek-n-find' puzzles.  The game feels cheaply made, and the heroine(the main paranormal detective) sports really hideous tramp nails that just adds to the feeling that the game is skeevey(just trust me on that---really strange and distracting manicure).  I don't usually come down so hard on games, but this one really dissapointed me and was more like a chore then a pleasant idle....  Avoid at any cost!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fabulous read from start to finish.  Even though the characters were young I was transported back to a time of innocent love. This was my first book purchased on my kindle and thoroughly enjoyed it!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've lifted for almost 13 years and had recently \\"plateau-ed\\" in my mass. I suspected it was a combination of both diet and fitness, which this book quickly confirmed. I finished the book two weeks ago and have fully implemented the routine laid out in Bigger, Leaner, Stronger. Though it is obviously far to early to have any physical results, I am much more mentally prepared in my workouts. Knowing that my lifts are scientifically-proven through research is a huge boost for me. Plus, my diet has improved greatly - tracking your numbers as the book recommends makes you incredibly aware of what you're putting in to your body.<br /><br />And as for supplements, the research the author has done is pretty impressive. I'm lactose intolerant so protein supplements can be pretty hard for me, but the author did a comprehensive scan so that there were lactose-free options.<br /><br />Finally, this isn't just a one-and-done fitness book, meaning that the author is committed to your individual health plan. In proof of that, he has emailed me and followed up with me privately on several occasions regarding questions I had. It's pretty hard to quantify that level of service, but it's sure worth more than $6 or 7 bucks you'll spend to buy this book.<br /><br />Read it, implement it. I'll follow up in a few months with some updates.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Good book for real it was a book about a dog named buck who is kidnapped and brought to Alaska
B00594XOZU|5.0|The best app you could ever have :) I love it<br />U need to get it I really recommended this app and its free
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I do like how it fits, I only wished that it rotated for those apps that don't, it doesn't stand up vertically very well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. Pretty realistic for an app. I'm enjoying it. G<br />ood . Way to pass time. Easy to use not that many bugs.
1450419895|4.0|This book contains important workout informations and very descriptive figures for beginners to body building sports as well as  professionals sporters.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|At first I thought it would make my Kindle look small but, I love this case! Its durable, sleek, makes my Kindle look like an ordinary notebook! Its totally awesome!
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|I have viewed all but season 6 of &#34;24&#34;. I recall a few weak times in the past (what season was it where Kim was chased down by a cougar?) but I mostly find little fault with the series. This season was very good. I think that it ranks with the best seasons of the series. I am going to miss this show...
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got for my daughter and I am just as addicted. My 4 year old loves all the colors and ponys.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|Unfortunately, The DVD Audio format has, for the most part, gone the way of the dinosaur.  It is refreshing to see the occasional disk make an appearance, especially one with a 5.1 mix,  (Most of the newer SACDs, a comparable format to DVD Audio, contain only two channel mixes, which I find very disappointing.)  I have not played this ELP on my home theater system yet but I am very impressed with the 5.1 and 2 channel DVD Audio mixes on my Hyundai Genesis Lexicon car audio system.  Highly recommended for those with the capability to take advantage of the DVD Audio format.  I also liked the DVD Audio of Tarkus, although, I've always had a preference, musically speaking, for ELPs first recording.  I'd like to see 5.1. mixes for Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery.
B00007E7K0|5.0|Lost it upon lending to a friend :-) but this looked a value for money purchase. THanks canon and Amazon for listing OEM products priced competitively.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just recently heard about this fabulous program and am catching up so I can watch the current season. Kept me occupied on my Kindle during quieter times while on vacation.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Even for non-trekkies, this is a wonderful film. concise storytelling, beautiful production values, and a lot of heart. This was our second time watching it, and it was even better than the first.
B002NXSRVG|3.0|i don't think the producer or director really knew what they were trying to make, shoot um, kick um, and kill um, thats the movie!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|While I cannot find any educational value in this game, which is important to me, my kids love it!  4 stars only because of the lack of useful learning.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I like this app which I got for free. The sounds are soothing, I use it for reading and when falling asleep. The loops don't bother me at all. Make sure you go to the website to get additional great sounds.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I LOVE HIS BOOKS, I LOVE THIS BOOK<br />I CAN NOT WAIT UNTIL I READ THE NEXT ONE, ON MY WAY
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Well told story and characters that you can care about.  I didn't like the ending, but overall, well worth reading.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|I think it was great! It is a great classic!! I definitely would rent it again sometime. I really recommend it.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I admit that I thought the whole gluten free craze was just the next bandwagon to jump on, but this book has changed my mind and I am now gluten free, dairy free, and meat free, and I finally feel great!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is the second series, so I had to buy it. It was very suspenseful. If you like the eclipse series this is better.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A little harder than the first one...  Still fun, but the graffix make it harder to go far.  But I just started playing and I'm sure I will get used to them.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|This book was a page turner loved the religious side of it and loved how things were explained but so shocked at the ending don't know would I go to see the movie because the ending was absolutely stupid.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app's sleep noises are so soothing. My favorite sounds are the fire and the chimes. It made me feel awake and refreshed in the morning; I slept all through the night.
B009EAALII|5.0|This blu-ray of Chris Isaak is enjoyable as all his music is.  These hi-def videos are a substantial improvement in video quality over regular DVDs, which makes for a very good viewing experience.
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a wonderful way to expel the demons in your past.  And yet how many people actually do such a thing?  This book was very inspirational.  I also loved her honesty about the good and the bad.  Wonderful journey and well written.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is sooooooooo awesome it is so like a real horse and the grafics are good but it is really hard to get gems I'm very happy that it is on kindle fire now and it works great it just takes a long time to load
B008OD38JK|5.0|Knowing that Hans Zimer wrote the music for these three movies was my main reason for seeing them.  I have the soundtracks for all three, but this is a new take on the music with slightly different orchestrations.  If you like zimmer, you will like this cd.
0345803485|4.0|This is pretty wild book. Do not buy it if you do not have an open mind.  It is very racy and has a lot of sex in it.  I had heard it was like that but decided to read it anyway.  I also ordered the next 2.  This first book has a surprise ending.  If you like Harlican Romance books or anything  on that order you will probably like this, but be ware, you were warned.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Good book, will be a great for my nine year old daughter to read. Great one to borrow from the library.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was very emotionally moved by this book.  A great insight to how some orpahned children get moved through the system - especially for those who are appear to be more &#34;damaged&#34;.  It was hard to read sometimes because you want the characters to act differently or you expect a different outcome.  The floral language was very interesting - I will never look at giving someone flowers the same way - the unspoken meaning of each and every flower can mean everything . . . .
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. I highly recommend this to anyone who thinks they've got it bad. What i found interesting was that it is a self help book in disguise. The message is that things are only as bad as you make them, and that there is always something or someone worth living for.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|It has been awhile since I read a book I did not want to put down.  Fall of Giants is that book.  Set during WW1, it takes you into the lives of British aristocracy and the working class, as well as Russian life.  It is engrossing and enjoyable.  Ken Follett is a good writer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game. this game is perfect for the whole family. lots of hours of fun. love all the games that are available.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|I really enjoyed hopw well they married the book to the series, it is a very well done book which I enjoyed quite a bit.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this if they could lower the price it would be better but I love it you can have  four or more people on multiplayer me my two sisters and my brother love it
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever. Everyone can relate to this movie. I would recommend this movie to someone going through a break-up. You'll laugh, cry and in the end feel a bit better about your current situation!
B000P7V45S|5.0|DVD sound is awesome, Just a great classic. The videos on the DVD are very good also. This also loaded into my cloud player for free , pretty cool
B00APUYWYA|4.0|From a parent's perspective; however, I thought there was too much emphasis in their singing about and talk of \\"sex\\". My girls are 11 & 9 and don't need to hear about sex that often, which is why I suppose it's rated PG-13. Otherwise the \\"cup\\" scene was pretty cool and has been practiced lots.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is like you have hot a horse of your own ... I have a horse and I love all the features on this game
0316069434|3.0|&#34;The Black Box&#34; by Micheal Connelly was not up to his usually performance. Somewhat wordy and overwhelmed with detail which did not enhance the plot. An OK Bosch novel.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Being able to check the weather in my town any time I want is so convenient for planning travel needs.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|WOW!  I have been enjoying the series, so I got the OST.  I am SO IMPRESSED (I am seldom impressed)!  The music is tight, the vocals are awesome and the production is excellent! This is one of the very best soundtracks that I have EVER experienced (I collect soundtracks).  I, truly, look forward to subsequent soundtrack volumes from, what I hope will be, a long running series (keep it interesting, Nashville).<br /><br />And money is being left on the table if these artists do not record because ALL of them are legit STARS! This what GOOD MUSIC sounds like!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|to be honest, even though I'm not the most into horses, I find this a very intreguing app. it isn't one of those annoying apps that don't let you do anything but I was wrong. if you have freetime and love horses or any animals you should get thisapp. they should make it for other animals.
B00355L2TU|2.0|The video played for about ten seconds and stopped. i Could not ever get the video to continue to play.
0525953728|5.0|I've never anticipated the release of any book as much as \\"No Easy Day\\" and I've eagerly listened to it three times since the release. Well written and even better when listened to on Audible.com. So, if you're interested reading a humble explanation of the raid on Bin Laden's compound this book is for you! Kevin Mauer is a professional and he transcripts \\"Owens\\" story in a way that is easy to understand and compelling.<br /><br />If you're planning on watching \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" then you should definitely read this first. You may find yourself with a better understanding of the actual mission.
0316228532|2.0|I received the book for Christmas as per my request. I wanted to see how Rowling would write adult fiction, being a huge HP fan. I had read a review in the local newspaper which was positive. What I did not get from the review was the amount of profanity and sexual subject matter. I could not count the number of times the \\"f\\" word was used, as well as others. Even if this is the way the characters would talk in \\"real life\\", the omniscient author can use other words and let the reader use their own imagination. I did not need these words to understand the despair or anger the characters felt. One of the reasons I like children's fiction is that because the author can't use profanity, or perhaps uses only mild profanity, they must have a broader vocabulary to describe emotions. Liberal use of profanity I think is often used as a crutch. While appreciating the social and personal issues of the characters, I was not interested in reading about their sexual issues in explicit terms. So, I was disappointed with the book. As soon as I finished it (I did care about the fates of the characters) I took it to a second-hand book shop for resale, and gave the proceeds to charity. If you are interested in the book, I suggest checking it out of the library before purchasing it for your collection.
0525478817|5.0|I really have nothing to say. Just GET THIS BOOK! It is so good,full of  humor, and events that will make you cry your eyes out. If only there was a movie to come out...
B005VPRET4|5.0|This was a Christmas gift, and from what I understand, it was a huge hit.  My granddaughter built it the day she opened it.
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|This is a good start or an app, but it still needs some work. It processes slow, so it really doesn't flow with your handwriting.
B006RA0E5I|5.0|Compact size, but doesn't feel tiny in my hand. I like the micro-adapter, it seems like there's nothing sticking out of my laptop. The rubberized texture is great! I love the rubberized paint that Lenovo uses on their ThinkPads, I bought this hoping it would resemble that & it does. The scroll wheel tilts left & right for added functionality, and the USB adapter can be stowed inside the device. The tracking is great & works on most surfaces you'd expect it to work on. Easy to set up, juts plug it in & go on Win7 & Win8. Advanced options & functionality are available. The only thing I would change is make the mouse buttons quieter, but that's a minor concern.<br /><br />Also, it included the batteries!

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very entertaining & good graphics!!! Would give it 5 stars if doesnt force close every once in a while when I use the jewel.  Still a really good game though ;-)
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I'm not really crazy about the cover art of this particular book. I will admit that had it not been recommended to me by someone I trust, I probably would not have bought it just because of the cover art. I am thoroughly enjoying this series and though I have not finished it yet. I have no doubt that I will at some point in the future
B008MX7Z32|5.0|The only thing I'd say this lamp could use in addition to all its features is a wall charger. Fortunately I already had several USB to wall outlet adapters so I just put one in the box as part of the gift. It does all of the listed features well and is very bright on its highest setting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is so much fun you can do any thing you want.<br />do you know you can duplicaqte blocks .
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I freaking love this show!!!!!! Everybody should watch this show!!!!!!!! I can't wait til I get the second season on dvd!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Love the way Colleen Hoover develops the characters in this book.  They have stuck with me.  Even though the topic of this story was a heavy one, the many sweet moments in this story make it worth a read.  I loved Slammed and this one also does not disappoint!
B002ZG976U|5.0|Great Movie!
0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief was our book club pick and when I first started it, I debated just ditching it...it was hard to get into, but I am SO glad I stuck with it. I too am surprised that this is a book in the \\"young adult\\" section, as it's a deep story and very detailed in the writing. I did love the point of view of the story being told by Death, what an interesting point of view to tell a story by! This story made me want to learn so much more about the Holocoust and WWII in Germany in general. I wish I was as interested in this during high school and I am now. I am looking forward to see what the other members of my book club thought of this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read this series 5 times already!  I can`t get enough!  Bravo!  Can't wait to see how this plays out on screen!!!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I have always love this movie since childhood.  I must watch it during the holidays.  This collection is nice because it has both the black and white and color version of this timeless classic.  I'm honored to own this.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I like to watch videos of new songs when they first come out.  This is a great way to watch the new video, if they have one, and to see the lyrics.
B000SEH13C|5.0|Have read Vonnegut most of my life, and loved every weird, amazing story.  This was<br />one I had missed (probably to young, at the time).  This is my current favorite book.<br />Read it and see what I mean
B0041KVX1A|5.0|I got this vinyl record for my cousin as a gift and she loves it! Also or arrived just on time for chtistmas
B007J4T2G8|1.0|For such a popular book, I expected some stellar writing. To say I was disappointed would be a monumental understatement.I suggest that E.L go back to Freshman Composition...maybe even high school. The plot, the characters, the so-called dialogue...don't get me started! Even the sex scenes are filled with holes, no pun intended. No wonder she uses a pseudonym. Of course, she's laughing all the way to the bank.  She has offered, on the Web, a prize if we tell her our favorite scene. Mine was the period after the final, badly constructed sentence.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love this for my kindle! Really happy that it was sold as a set and I didn;t have to buy them individually. Also reads like one book, not four individual ones.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This one felt like an episode of law and order on the lifetime channel! Sometimes just what a girl needs!!!!!!!
0811821846|5.0|Easy receipes and very funny & cute!! I love this book. A definate must for every culinary inclined Star Wars fan!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome<br />Just one hundred percent awesome<br />Buy all the books in the series I have read them all and it so awesome
B0086700CM|4.0|I found it somewhat hard to maneuver and get powerups and upgrades. Other than that, it is a very addicting game and fun.
B00821OW8K|4.0|I could not find any series I really was interested in. Walking Dead was on hiatus. I searched instant prime shows and found this. I love it. I watched both seasons within a week. I wish they had more episodes per season. I can't wait for the third season.<br /><br />Sometimes I think I know what is going to happen and sometimes I am right, however many more times I am surprised and sitting on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />It is a great tale of family and friendship.<br /><br />There is of course a lot of blood and guts, so if you get grossed out than it might not be for you. But it is no where as gory as The Walking Dead. It also is pretty clean as far as sexual content. I think it would be fine for an eleven or twelve year old.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I like it, but the demo time is too short, and you can't replay the same level you were playing. So you have to constantly make new worlds just to play the demo. Other than that, it is a little different from playing minecraft. Survivalcraft has more items such as paint. Easy to move and auto jumps. Easy to look, and you can't sleep in demo mode. Honestly, I would just go and get the purchased survivalcraft because the demo isn't worth it.<br /><br />Pros: More items<br />  Easy to maneuver<br /><br />Cons: Too short demo time<br />  Can't sleep<br />  Can't replay the same level<br />  Have to keep making new levels
B002C1Q6MQ|5.0|As always Michael will not dissappoint you I really enjoyed this DMD he sing the songs so beautifully ,if you like his music don't pass this one up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. It is very addicting. I found it easier to get powerups and upgrades. It is also a lot easier to get coins.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|My 9 year old son just finished reading the book for his Book Club at school. He didn't think he would like it at all, surpisingly, he did! He couldn't wait to see the movie then. He enjoyed both.<br />I thought it was alright, as well! =^..^=
B00594XOZU|2.0|I downloaded this app by mistake, so now I have to review it. I don't know how it works and this review is pointless.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|LOVED this movie...it is very raw, but VERY good! A girl friend and I rented it because of Shia LaBeof, but it was so good I watched it with my husband a second time!! (I think us girls liked it better than my husband :))
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. I have fun trying to get the sensei swag like the swords and the backrounds.
B0001I561E|5.0|I grew up watching this movie, even saw it when it came out in the theaters, and wanted my son to have a similar experience. Still love it after all these years.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I didn't know it was for a kindle until I was done purchasing it. I played it on my friends iPad and it was fun.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Another Disney classic that I had to have for my son to grow up with. Still great after all these years.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|As soon as you start the game, you blast through a wall and start to fly away on a jetpack. The game is fun and enjoyable.
0767836324|5.0|This movie is a classic. Still entertaining, funny, and heartfelt after all these years. Ordered this to share with my son so he can grow up with it like I did.
B001O6W9QC|4.0|Wow! Filled with lots of star power, although predictable still funny. Would definitely recommend. Tom Cruise totally surprised me, I had no idea he was in this movie and it took me a minute to figure out who he was. The voice was so familiar but wow, ....
B00005N6KG|5.0|Only ones that work for me, and hard to find. I much prefer these to earbuds! A+++ for me! :)
B0087DFIYA|4.0|Everything as expected, however can understand why this feature went straight to the video market. Was a bit rough in areas and the story line was a bit &#34;same oh. same oh.&#34;
1416972250|5.0|This book is best one I have read so far it had a good mixture of action and romance to make it a good book for both boys and girls. The suspense continues throughout the entire book. This book brings in a few new characters which you will have to read and find for yourself. It is a book that you won't be able to put down once you start reading it. Although I might be cursed by all the Harry Potter fans out there I would say this book series is better and more exciting than the Harry Potter series.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Pros: cost and its super effective.<br />Cons: it's a bit hard to use the serrated sharpener. The ceramic and carbide straight edge sharpeners work amazing, while rotating the keychain sized device and pulling away at a 15 degree angle is a bit hard. It does work, though.<br />All-in-all, I would recommend this to anyone needing a simple sharpener.
B006XF5BTG|1.0|I'm surprised this book has as many 5 star reviews as it does. It does not deserve them. It does a poor job at what it sets out to do - provide an easy to follow guide to losing weight and gaining lean muscle.<br /><br />As many reviewers have noted, the book does some things well, and others poorly. It seems to be roughly organized into 3 parts - Motivation, nutrition and diet, and exercise.<br /><br />The first section - motivation - is largely devoid of actual information, although could be helpful for someone who needs to be told how easy the book's plan is - repeatedly - and how quickly they will see definite results if the plan is followed exactly. This section has two major flaws: The first is that the plan is not an easy plan at all. It IS a GOOD plan, but to bill a plan that requires EXACT meal planning, careful calorie counting, careful attention to the proportion of each meal that comprises fat, carbs, and protein, and rigorous discipline, as an EASY plan is simply inaccurate for anyone with a demanding career or home-life. It appears the author is looking at the demands his plan makes from the perspective of someone whose job is to be a fitness professional - not someone who has other responsibilities. (Incidentally, there is nothing wrong with a challenging plan - but this one will not work well for someone who cannot devote substantial attention to it.) The second flaw is that Mr. Matthews spends a great deal of time addressing how dietary supplements are unnecessary but spends an equal amount of time pointing people to the (numerous) specific products he uses. A quote from his \\"The Bottom Line\\" section, \\"Stick to protein supplements, a pre-workout drink, creatine, glutamine, a multi-vitamin, and throw in CLA and green tea extract if you're cutting, and you'll be supplementing the smart way\\". While these two positions aren't explicitly contradictory, they grate in a way that hurts Matthews' credibility.<br />Matthews' credibility is also damaged as hecomes off as somewhat arrogant, or holier-than-thou in that he spends far too much time being appalled that there are professionals with opinions different than his own, or people that actually drink (GASP) tap water. The author is clearly a man who is obsessive/compulsive about his diet and activity. If you cannot afford to be similarly obsessive/compulsive, this book will be little practical use to you.<br /><br />The second section of the book relates to diet, and is a decent rough description of the concepts - many of them widely accepted - behind how to eat healthier for weight loss and muscle gain. What is missing here, unfortunately, is any sort of specific plan. Matthews proposes nutrition breakdowns, but does not provide much in the way of helpful information on what foods should comprise the nutrition. He does point out that the reader could buy another book of his if they are interested in this information. That would be forgivable except that the information is CRITICAL to adopting the very plan this book puts forth. The reader is left with the choice of seeking out a more comprehensive book in addition to this one, or doing a substantial amount of independent research just to be able to follow through the dietary plan this book proposes.<br /><br />The last section of the book has a basic weight-lifting regimen. Only three exercises are actually described in detail, with diagrams used sparingly. Other exercises are referred to only by name and Matthews recommends the reader to an outside web source suggesting they go there to watch videos to see how to do them. Again, this is not necessarily horrible, but does cause a reader to wonder if Matthews might be planning a book on Renaissance art that consists only of a suggestion that the reader visit the Louvre. What, exactly, is the reader paying for here?<br /><br />Sadly, a great deal of the book is very broad information that directs the reader to more specific sources - sources which the author will conveniently sell them. Given that the reader has presumably already purchased this book - to get the very information they are being directed to - it is hard not to feel there is little value for money here.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the book is readable, flows well, and is conversational in tone. It is not well organized and would be difficult to use as a reference despite its brevity. Much of the information is easily accessible for free online and that which is not can be characterized as the author's personal experiences and opinions. The information that is here is good - although, again, poorly organized. If you are willing to pay the purchase price for the benefit of having Matthews compile some general information on your behalf, it is worthwhile. You could also save your money and simply spend 3-4 hours reading free material online.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I had a hard time letting the book down.  When I got to the middle of the book, I could not stop and finished it. Great Read!!
B00127RAJY|4.0|So far so good!  I like this workout, since I never have time to go to a gym it is nice to have something that actually works at home.  I have tried all three workout levels, and I tend to use the first level the most just because that is the one that really gets me sweating.  Lost a few pounds already, so excited to continue.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this game is gust over all better overall<br /> the graphics to the sound<br /> and that I does not freeze up as often
B005RUUUAI|5.0|My husband and I caught on late to the Walking Dead, so I was so happy we could watch them on demand through amazon.  We are hooked!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Love this game.  Awesome graphics.  I wish the game was longer.  I love games where u have to use your brain and this game you have to.
B007SGM084|5.0|Once you start you won't be able to put these books down. Make sure you buy all three as you will read them back to back.
B008OJ291W|5.0|My wife asked for this after watching the infomercial on QVC. The guy really put his heart and soul into this and I find myself playing it every few days. Great job!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The imangi studios had skillfully created a new and improved version of temple run. They have added new graphics, scenery, and obstacles but haven't lost the classic fun that made the first temple run such a hit. Great app totally worth it.
B0050R0XEG|4.0|bought this as a Christmas present for my dad. Hey owns a 40 yr old limited model T2 that's sort of between the T1 and the T2. He has all kinds of models resembling his camper, but didn't have a lego one yet. The detail is amazing. Comes with 2 instruction books (not booklets).<br /><br />Only gripe: The logo - the V and W are not connected. Seems odd, especially for the price on this sucker.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun ap that lets you exersize your brain.  It starts out easy so you can get the feel for it, and then gets more challenging.  I enjoy games that make you think ahead, and this one fits the bill.
B002E5N6CI|5.0|This is an excellent album, Issac at his best I do believe. One of those artist whom never really got his just rewards. Highly recommend if you love old school.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Why did anyone feel the need to make this movie?  It's really bad.  It's the only Bruce Willis movie I don't like.
1603427244|5.0|Have been knitting for most of my life, but I always like to learn new techniques.  Checked this book out from my local library and used it so much I purchased my own copy.  This is not new and cutting edge, but is rather a wonderfully illustrated and very clear collection of solid varied techniques which I have and will continue to refer to often.  Excellent addition to my knitting library and I highly recommend.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|El primer BD o Blue Ray de la banda inglesa Coldplay, es la síntesis de su gira Mylo Xyloto que fue espectacular en cada una de las ciudades y paises que fueron, la calidad del BD es muy buena, los menús con un toque 3D muy interesante, gran listado de temas mas que lo único malo pero segun se vea es que hay interrupciones entre canciones dando a dar la  experiencia a un documental no a un clasico concierto como por ejemplo los  magnos de Queen, pero todo sea tu gusto, pero es muy bueno. PolarWorks, Guatemala 2013
B007SGM084|5.0|I am a person that does not read.  I have not picked up a book in 14 years.  Everyone was telling me I needed to read this book, so I did.  I have to say I have already read it twice within a months time.
B008RTE09S|5.0|Gira Magica y Misteriosa es la película Beatle que a sigo todo un fenómeno después de su original época, en algunos paises fue proyectada en Cines, otros como en mi caso la disfrutamos con los colores mas puros que nos brinda el BD, genial material inedito mejorado a lo grande, perfecto para un gran coleccionista Beatle súper recomendado. PolarWorks, Guatemala 2013
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|His books are so funny and clever! I really enjoyed this book, despite the fact that I usually read books by Jane Austen and Steinbeck
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, they pull me back in! Godfather fans should snap up this collection. It looks even better in Blu-ray.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I did not care for Rod Stewart until one night I saw him on the Jay Leno show and at that time I fell in love with him and when his Christmas Album was available  I could not wait  until I had it.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I have no idea what &#34;Gilmore girls&#34; is about, but my daughter wanted it so I got it for her. By the way, she loves it!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was very well written and had a great flow to it. . I didn't want to put it down.  Would definitely recommend reading.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|If you are any kind of fan of &#34;the Big Bang Theory' you will love this complete first season collection. Bazinga!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I recently caught on to The Black Keys, through the airplay of &#34;Gold on the ceiling&#34;. This is no 1 hit wonder band, as this offering has 3 songs which have had serious airplay in the northern part of the state. Along with the afore-mentioned &#34;Gold on the Ceiling&#34;, &#34;Lonely Boy&#34;, and &#34;Sister&#34; have also been frequent players. The driving beat and bass remind me of The White Stripes, though I prefer this groups sound over them. I'm going to do a little back buying and check out their debut disc, along with &#34;Brother&#34; their last effort. I give the boys 2 thumbs up!!
B000002UVX|5.0|This is the beginning of metal funk. It came out of Jimi; seaching for a new sound with the wah-wah pedal. The bass is deep and funky; wih a twist of the a shout out to the Black Panthers in Chicago, Ill. Who was shot to death in 1969. Also; a protest against the Veitnam War. The draft was out then; there was no choice. If you wanted to be in the armed forces or not. Listen close, to the music and lyrics. It still is true today. Now; listen to \\"Power of Love\\". This a protest movement; of today. Obama; is President;now. So; this a review of that times haven't changed that much. This is so much in time, today. Billy Cox; is understated as a bass player. His bass is deep and funky. While; Buddy Miles on drums, and vocals is deep; today. What this group did can't be redid; today. So, this c.d. is very much a part of the funk revolution. Anyone who is a funkmaster or funkladymaster. Needs to get this. I'm starting to play parts of this c.d. on my bass; the lead guitar and bass.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Finally a good book, very sexy in a good way. What a fantasy for all woman young and old. Can't wait to read the next book.
B007RE0RR8|4.0|It's not made very well but my daughter still loves them my daughter collects them so she has 87 of them and she's a big fan of them
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's an easy and fun game however, it tends to glitch a lot on the kindle fire. Other than that it's a great and fun game.
B008TTPQXA|4.0|I totally believe that what Dr Alexander reports was his experience when in his coma. it is not possible that a man of high standing in the medical community would make up a story like this. knowing, as he would, that his reputation risked destruction as result.<br />Even if you are not predisposed to believe in an afterlife, his description of feeling total love has to be reassuring.<br />I do not think his title is good, as he does not actually prove there is an afterlife. I think this is impossible to prove, and certainly not with science!<br />Certainly worth a read.
141659521X|5.0|Just finished this book and was extremely pleased, ranks up there in the top 3 Flynn books I've read. The story picks up in present day( last two books were prequels) and Rapp just keeps doing what he does best. There is a small surprise with the return of a character from a few books back that I found to be interesting. All in all, if you're a die hard Flynn fan, you won't be disappointed!
B004FOA84A|5.0|I had fun with this one. It wasn't overly difficult, but was quite entertaining. Could have lasted longer.  I hated to get to the end. Lots of things to explore and figure out. Stunning graphics and good music.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read. Looked forward to ant chance to site with this book, and see just what Gillian Flynn would make these characters go through. If you're not familiar with Flynn's work be warned, she is down right mean to her characters. But boy is it fun to watch.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Normally when I get the free edition of a game, I don't expect much, but I was blown away!  I loved this game!  I will so buy the full version.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much of the story the free version let me explore.  I also love the variety.  It's not just a hidden objects game, but so much more.  Truly interesting.  The graphics are beautiful, the music is great, and they combine to create a really eerie atmosphere, sometimes even scary.  I highly recommend this one!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Good game to download. My grand kids love this. You are able to see if to see if you can beat your high score and get three stars.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I consider this book.<br />It keep me up all night reading I loved it I would recommend this book for good readers.
0765325950|5.0|Very satisfactory end to a good series. Only wish they'd released the eBook at the same time as it annoys me to have the rest of the series on my iPad and then this massive tome to deal with.
0785134352|4.0|This comic os so enjoyable it has funny scenes great artwork and the story plot is incredible I cant wait for the movie KickAss 2 to come out.
B00AE2J93I|5.0|This movie was surprisingly enjoyable and funny.  I could watch it over and over.  Highly recommend this movie for all ages.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is the awesomest game ever everyone in the world should play seriously I want to thank who ever made this game
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Cute movie. Kids should like it a lot. As for adults? Not scary enough. But could be for little kids.
0345803493|4.0|After reading the first book in the series I had to pick up the 2nd and continue reading. I had to know what was going to happen next...
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This product is a good time occupier :) the graphics keep my daughter entertained so i'm one happy mom!! !
0425263908|3.0|I bought this book after reading the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy. From the description it was supposed to be in the same category but I feel it's a bit lacking... The storyline is a little too fake and not that captivating as the 50 shades' books. At least the 50 shades trilogy is a bit more like watching a Lifetime Movie whereas this story is more like a Skinamax type cable porn movie.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is hilarious! I highly recommend this movie. You will love the music that is performed by very talented actors.
0345803485|5.0|I heard about the book through a co-worker and we decided to get the books and start our own book club. We could not put the book down. The storyline is very good and it keeps you interested
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Very happy with product.  Hope I don't have to add to many more words to this.  Very happy with purchase
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Lots of fun. This is one of those games that takes a daily check to get very far, but its possible to get high up in the ranks without spending any money. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has a few glitches now and again, but definently worth the download.
B00005N6KG|5.0|My last pair were stolen so when I started to look for a replacement pair it didn't take me long to come to the conclusion that these were the best ones for me. I have tried over the ear and in ear for running and just never found them as comfortable as these. These stay put, the overhead part is adjustable so you can get the ear pieces just right. The only critiscm I have is I would like a volume control on the ehadphoens instead of fussing with my iPod when I'm running. They are comfortable even after hours of use which is more than I can say for the others I have tried. The sound works for me clear and as it should sound but if you are a music sound buff you may require somethign a bit more &#34;expensive&#34; to meet your needs but for listening to music as I run or at work these rock!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is something fun to pass some time that doesn't require much effort for a lot of entertainment in return.
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|I am a fan of some of Bruno Mars music! I haven't actually heard the album but one thing is keeping me from buying it is the Explicit lyrics. Really?? I am sure a guy as talented as Bruno Mars can find other choice words to get his point across rather the explicit ones. What happened to clean music with a powerful message. Such as shame!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Can't believe this never made it to the theaters. Story is good. And $10 is a &#34;just right&#34; price for this DVD. It's, for sure, a keeper & well worth that price.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This CD had an extra song on it, that the American version did not.  It was not scratched and in good condition.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|This was just as good as the first if not better.<br /> Can't wait to start the next book. Pure awesomeness.
1451695187|5.0|I would recommend this book to all out there for a good read. All ages should read this book. Very inspirational.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|I was really disappointed - I thought this would be about an older married couple finding love again - the focus was on sex, which is only a part of good relationship. Parts of it were uncomfortable to watch. I would not recommend this movie.
B009ME47H2|1.0|This product did not work for me, don't know if the product sucked or my abilities sucked but i didn't have good luck with it!
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|I loved this movie - it made me laugh and it made me get teary-eyed as I thought about how many times I wished I could bring my Buncie (beagle) back. I highly recommend it and it's good for all ages in my opinion.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Not a good movie - speechless. Definetly Adult view only and not sure if Adults can stand watching much less listening to the strong accent.
B003L20IJM|5.0|I liked the original Nanny McPhee and thought I'd check out the sequel.  For a family-friendly movie, it is great.  I babysit children aged 2 to 10 years and they love watching it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The only thing i didn't like about this book was that it ended. I wanted the story to keep going on. I loved the characters and the pictures just made it more enduring.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|once in a lifetime story- being from Detroit made it even a little better<br />I am amazed that his talent did not do better in the US
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I had a hard time getting through Matched. But found Crossed much more engrossing. Crossed is way more involved then Matched was.<br />Overall i enjoyed Crossed much more then Matched.
B007PEIHKE|4.0|This product is relatively easy to configure and works really well so far. Grandstream is recommended. It is not the first product we buy from them.
B0063GORYU|1.0|Very difficult to control game. The cards do not stay where they are moved and or can not be moved
B00ADS98FC|5.0|We liked this movie very much. The music is great and the plot very good. It deals with conflicts in university and as such one can expect some inappropriate behavior but surprisingly not much. It is a very entertaining movie overall about a girl finding herself in college.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this backpack! My husband and I hike alot and having this bag on our back and our hands free makes it easier to hike. I have wanted one for a long time and your price is perfect. The bag is wonderfully constructed. I would reccomend this backpack to everyone.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Three generations -Grandmother, aunt, and grand daughter have all played and enjoyed the game while giving each other hints.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is good but every time you shuffle you get an advertisement ad, which if you are not interested in the ad you have to close it so that you can return to the game.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I really like the versatility of stand options.  It is very well made and I love the color.  I would recommend this product to everyone.
1603420398|5.0|So many things to do...and so easy to learn.....góðar myndir og mörg flott munstur og gerðir af alls konar ferningum og fleiru
B00AEBBA1I|5.0|Normally this would be a place where I would share a movie review of some sort here but given this movie isn't new, I would venture to say you're arrival here is no accident. You want to know about the product at hand and whether or not it's worth the price of what you're really getting.<br /><br />You do get the Blu-ray movie of Sweeney Todd in it's beautiful 1080p HD goodness. However I would like to point out that the description and item picture are not entirely accurate.<br /><br />When I received my copy, the front cover appeared to be washed out, the red area's are a light orange. However on the back, there is a blend of both red and orange colors together, so it comes across as me as this was color distortion was intentional for the new edition of the movie. Not a result of a print flaw.<br /><br />Opening it, I found that there is only one disk, not two. So the item description is incorrect and should be fixed. It should also be known to anyone purchasing the movie, to be aware of this.<br /><br />The lack of item accuracy is the ONLY THING preventing this from being 5/5. Otherwise, the movie is perfect quality and arrival was exactly when it was supposed to arrive.<br /><br />** I would like to correct my review now that the product page has in fact been updated to properly describe the item. **<br /><br />5/5

Good luck nextseason, though; I think I burned up all my suspension of dis-belief. I am optimistic, though :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What more can I say that hasn't been said? It's a fantastic series. I wish this is what would have caught on back in the day instead of Twilight.
B0071MQ37E|5.0|As great as the show was, I enjoyed after the show the best - such a treat to watch Andrew Lloyd Webber and the others - definitely worth the money!
B002QE3CTY|3.0|To be honest, I really wanted to get into this book. Based on other books I liked, it seemed like the natural choice. Plus, everyone else likes it!<br /><br />I really felt like the beginning was too slow. Every time I picked it up, the urge to keep reading dwindled.<br /><br />I devoured Hunger Games so I don't know if it's just a different style.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the game but it has a tendency to not want to open up properly. Fix that and you git a winner.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|In this book, the series takes a steep decline as the story simply follows a very boring and stale pattern of \\"but i love him.... no, i love him...\\" with some cool elements going on in the background. I was really hoping the romance would take a back seat. I found myself wishing it would end soon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend this trilogy to everyone that can or wants to think out of the box! I enjoyed the constant action and having to think and feel a new concept of a world such as this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|In a feat of true literary stamina, I read this book front to back without taking a break. That's right, straight through. That says enough about it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! The characters and story are beautifully written. I consider it one of my favorite books I've ever read! I would recommend it to anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The hunger games was awesome and so is this. One of the best books I ever read... read the book
B0099114WO|5.0|I think a couple married for alot of years and slowly drifting apart would enjoy this movie. The love is there, just need to rekindle the romance..........
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so awesome! The graphics are also way better than the first temple run. I really like the new ziplines in this game.If you love the oringanal temple run then you will like this temple run.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|The first book in the series begins with magic and mystery. I really enjoyed this book. A great escape from everyday mundane.
B0073PPXLG|5.0|My husband and I caught part on this movie on television with commercials and really wanted to see the entire movie without interruptions. I'm so happy that my husband after lots of searching finally located it through Amazon. We rented it in HD for only $2.99 and really enjoyed it. Lots of Stars in this movie. Great story.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I've loved Bones since it started and have read most of Kathy Reich's books.  It's got all the ingredients for a great story and I could watch the episodes over and over, especially the early ones.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If you like Greek mythology you will love this book. Rick Riordan takes Greek and Roman mythology to a whole new way.  I can`t wait for the book the house of Hades.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The Song of Ice and Fire continues and I find myself growing even more addicted.  Many series fail to deliver the promise of the original novel (Dune is a case in point), but this series continues to feel fresh, and I anticipate continuing to read the succesor novels.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game!  It's the best game I've ever played. Temple Run has always been an addictive game for me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best sequel to the first temple run it os worth it. I think this is the best game ever!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I. can find out the weather for the day and dress accordingly, and whether umbrella and if boots are needed.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Words cant describe how great this album really is, the whole meaning of this album really makes you pay attention. this album feels like a fresh breath in hip hop. I havent felt this much emotion over an album before. it had me tearing up and thinking of all the good times and bad times. by far the best rap album in the last decade.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|fun<br />super super super super fun<br />super super super super fun and amazing game.<br />get it or else you wont enjoy this amazing game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book grabbed my interest from the beginning.  It has lots of twists and turns and &#34;I didn't see that coming&#34; moments.  The characters were well-developed and I just couldn't wait to read what would happen next.  This book doesn't dissappoint.  I have already recommended Hopeless to others.<br />'
B006X5L6VS|1.0|This is not the same version as seen on iPads and iPhones. The lack of a compass prevents the very selling point that makes it so appealing on those formats..which is to aim it at the sky and have the screen update.I would go so far as to say they should offer a refund since there seem to be so many other Kindle users saying the same thing.If anything, it should be free since it is so different,
B00A1U2SVS|1.0|Like many others here I am a lifelong LZ fan.  In fact, for many years I'm what you would have called obsessive.  I can't explain how so many others gave this a high rating:  there are so many negatives to this CD:<br />- Plant unable to sing the high notes (no big surprise, and he does a decent-enough job)<br />- Page:  sloppiest I've ever heard him<br />- Song versions:  generally the same as on the original recordings, except muddied by excessive distortion. Very excessive.  Somebody should have explained to the band that simply playing the same old songs with more distortion and at a higher volume wouldn't produce a great recording.  It just results in very loud and very distorted songs.<br />- Solos:  really really muddied.  For example, I was thrilled to see In My Time of Dying on the playlist - I knew that if Page could pull it off, that song could be the highlight of the show - the guitar playing on the studio version is outstanding and I would not have minded if he'd played that solo note-for-note from the original recording.  Well, he tries to do that, but does a terrible job - this version was awful - the notes are so muddy and buried.  You just can't make out a lot of what he is playing.  It's just one big sloppy mess that could have been better-played by Page had he practiced this more.<br />- Improvisation:  my greatest disappointment in this CD.  Improvisation is what really made LZ great in concert, and stood them out from almost every other band. You never knew what they were going to pull out of their hats for the show. I know that Plant didn't want to do any improvisation, but geez, didn't anybody explain to him that LZ's improvisation was the best thing about them.  To hear them throw in some of the music that influenced them or that they admired (e.g. Elvis) into a classic LZ song is thrilling.<br />- Contribution to the LZ catalogue:  The songs on this album add nothing to the LZ catalogue. Absolutely nothing.  I challenge anybody to find a version of any song on this album that is better than all of the other studio or other live recording made by LZ.  There are no songs here where you say to yourself, \\"wow, that version blows every other version of this song out of the water...\\"<br />- Dazed and Confused:  I know I will be attacked for this, but did we really need another extended guitar-as-violin/stoner solo.  It's the most self-indulgent song LZ ever did, and it might have been cool in 1970 to hear this live, but 40 years later it's just awful.  Could anybody play this for somebody new to LZ today and argue that this piece of music has any relevance or lasting value?<br /><br />I am truly amazed that so many people gave this a 4 or 5 star rating.  I'd be curious to know how they rank this against other LZ recordings.  In my opinion, this is at the bottom.  All of their official live recordings are better than this, and every bootleg I have of LZ is far superior to this recording.  I'm really disappointed in this CD.  I suspect a lot of people gave this such a high rating simply because it was made by LZ and didn't give it a serious critical review.  A few years from now, I suspect this will be considered one of the all-time great disappointments in LZ's history.

B001IYCMNA|1.0|These devices work great until they cut-out every 5 minutes and you have to reset them to get a wireless signal.  I strayed from my two mainstays Netgear and D-Link and went for this business class WAP.  I need to be WAPPED in the head for purchasing these, what trash and Cisco won't address the problems.
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Conan the Barbarian (1982) and its legendary score by Basil Poledouris. Originally, I bought the Prometheus Records 2-CD rerecording since it was the only official release, at the time, that contained the complete score. That all changed, however, when Intrada's 3 CD set came along, which contained the complete ORIGINAL recording, aong with the original 1982 album.<br /><br />There isn't much I can say about Conan the Barbarian that hasn't been said already: it' simply one of the best film scores ever written!<br /><br />If you're a fan of Basil Poledouris and/or his Conan score, and you've been dying to get your hands on the complete ORIGINAL score, this is the set for you! I also recommend the Prometheus Records rerecording because it has its fair-share of great moments as well. Plus, the rerecording is a little cleaner of a performance, however there's a nostalgia factor to the original recording's slight performance faults, so that's why I recommend getting both.<br /><br />However, if you can only buy one, I'd recommend this version over the rerecording.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|Wonderful story and acting.  It is a true pleasure to watch and I recommend purchasing it and adding it to your collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is pretty fun. The graphics are great. This game makes me think this is easier than owning a real horse.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is a very good book. I couldn't put it down it really keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The new and improved graphics are beautiful and crisp, and there are a few new obstacles to traverse such as the zip line, rivers, and mining cart among others.  However the old temple run was just right angles, there are gradual curves in this that can block your view of upcoming turns.  Overall it is just as fun!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Terrific story line and great twists.  I would laugh out loud remembering the 80s items in this book.  Really could have done without the love story...understand why it is there, but still.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|this film solidified Tom Cruise as my absolute least favorite actor of all time. I've actually thrown out some of his older movies after he did this. He's essentially ruined the Jack Reacher character, both for movie goers and for readers.

B00A9X9ORI|3.0|If you can believe we will have time travel in 2030 then it's not a bad movie. But then you have to suspend belief for all time travel movies I suppose. It has Bruce Willis in it, so that alone is worth giving it a shot.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan brings the heart of the stories we most need to hear back into the world. For adults as well as teens who have ever felt like they're not sure where they fit in or the value of courage, ingenuity & friendship, The Mark of Athena bridges the gap between ancient mythology & modern day technology in a most brilliant form. His books make for great gifts, wonderful reading & are a great way to remember that we are all heroes in our own unique way.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me hooked from the first few pages. I try to stay away from romantic novels- if you can even refer to Hopeless as such, for it holds much more than romance in its almost five hundred pages- but this one caught my eye. Only a few books have made me gasp aloud, or wipe tears from my cheeks, and this one definitely did both. Numerous times.<br /><br />I recommend this to ANYONE who enjoys the feeling of their heartstrings being tugged on, as well as those who feel particularly hopeless (sorry for the pun; I had to), for this novel will surely bring hope back to you.

B007SXB498|5.0|English literature at it's best. This is a perfect e-reader or kindle version of any kind. Suggest reading this before any visual represenatation.  If viewed, suggest the Emma Thompson version. She manages to capture all of the subtle emotional inferences on which eveything depends.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is the first time I've read this author and I couldn't put this book down. But, to say this is the best and hardest book I've ever read is putting it lightly. I've laughed and cried more today than I have in a long time. I feel blessed to have meet Will & Louisa. I enjoy my romance books, but this is a \\"LOVE Story\\". When you LOVE someone you want them to grow in life, to experience life with a passion and hunger that challenges their very soul. LOVE is not ever easy. Sometimes LOVE is letting your other half go to in order to free them from the restraint of themselves. And sometimes LOVE is allowing someone to make their own decisions and being there for them no matter hardship or consequences on yourself. LOVE is selfless and painful. I'm a nurse and I help people who are quadriplegic frequently. So agreeing or disagreeing with the moral side to this book very difficult for me. Sometimes people hold on to hope without the thought to quality of life. I see it everyday. And the fears Will has are very real from the medical standpoint. I like to think I understand Will 's character as much as an AB can , and  those that are dealt this hand in life are stronger people than you can ever imagine. This was the hardest book to read, because I felt where Will was coming from but I also experienced that heartbreaking hope from Louisa till the very last chapter. To tell you to read this book is to ask you to experience LOVE from a different angle. A selfless one, an all consuming LOVE, a LOVE that is truly life changing. As hard as this book is to experience I have already purchased it in hardback as well and will be reading it again, just with a breather first.

I ordered this 3 times on Bluray, and it won't play on my Oppo player with latest firmware....which plays all other blurays...because it is indicated as non-Region A (USA).  Possibly there is a glitch with Oppo, or my particular machine (unlikely), or some technical glitch within the Bluray itself.  I sent a copy to Oppo so they can test it.  I finally plan to order using Amazon video-on-demand (regretfully).  I support gay movies like this, so this is frustrating.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|different....fun.....but still too many issues.  read some of the reviews......they're correct......it freezes, way too sensitive at times, and a problem that I have and cannot figure out is that my coins that I'm accumulating disappear and I'm unable to buy any type of upgrades.  weird.
1604443502|5.0|We know George Orwell through Animal Farm and 1984. But you will be missing out if you don't read his essays, nonfiction, diaries and earlier novels. What you'll find is an extraordinary person and writer.<br /><br />I've been reading his diaries and this \\"novel\\" at the same time. This is his first novel, published in 1933, and is highly autobiographical and reads more like a memoir. His prose is seamless. The sense of who he is comes through clearly--honest, intelligent and open to everyone he meets.<br /><br />I don't believe I've ever read such a realistic portrait of poverty in fiction or nonfiction.<br /><br />It starts with Paris where he lives in complete poverty. He goes days without food. It seems almost impossible to land a job. He pawns everything for a piece of bread. His room is filthy and filled with bugs.<br /><br />He has a keen eye for life around him. He meets a variety of characters, but it is Boris, a former Russian military man with waiter experience, who adds color and humor into the down and out experience in Paris.<br /><br />In London, you are not allowed to stay in one place for more than one or two nights. He is wanderer along with a fellow \\"tramps.\\" Again a variety of characters populate Orwell's harsh world. There is stealing and and deterioration, but also honesty and uplifting human connections, particularly notable is a crippled storyteller, philosopher and street painter named Bozo.<br /><br />Of course, you can't help but think about how much we have, when I got up to eat some blueberries I purchased at Trader Joes, while I was reading this powerful book.

1594744769|3.0|As the protaganist says, there is the Before and After.<br /><br />I loved the book in the Before, all the interesting characters in his life, like the grandfather and parents and his weird friend, Ricky. His sarcastic commentary had me laughing and laughing.<br /><br />Then we got into Miss Peregrine's house, which I could see coming, the peculiar children were not nearly as interesting as his grandfather made out; in fact, they got downright annoying with their paranoia and ignorance, though some had lived so many years.<br /><br />The story just got weirder and weirder. I was so disappointed not to see a resolution, but what will apparently become yet another dysptopian trilogy.
B0058Z4NR8|1.0|The only premise of this book was made in the first couple of pages. The remainder is a repetitious meandering world history book which repeats the major premise on almost every page. It uses the same examples over and over. I have read about half of it because I must for a book club but it's like having a root canal without an anesthetic. I'm not a history major and so cannot comment on the accuracy of the many historical vignettes, but other reviewers have reported a plethora of inaccuracies. Don't buy this book unless you want a sedative to help you sleep.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I have several cases for my Kindle Fire (a 360 rotating case by Mini Suit, a gel backing, and a zipper case).  This is by far the best one.  I highly recommend it.  I can stop looking for cases now :)  I like this particular folio case because it is lightweight, durable, and does not ad any bulk to the devise.  The Kindle Fire snaps in securely (but can be easily removed). The inside front cover is lined with a soft material that protects the screen.  The strap holds the flap closed, although I do not use it all the time.  The cover folds back into a stand which works pretty well.  Professional look, but great for everyday use!  I got the graphite which has a lighter grey backing and darker grey front with a black strap.  It also comes in black, pink, and white.  You won't be disappointed with this case.  Worth the 29.99.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|In terms of set and detail it is impeccable. In terms of acting, direction, editing it is a masterpiece conveying volumes in a single word, whole scenes in a glance. A treasure to watch, it is only sad that the seasons are so short.

B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a tender, sweet story about children who overcome painful memories in their pasts, while restoring a Secret Garden to its former glory.  It has a message of encouragement that uplifts the reader. As if this weren't enough reason to read this book, it's a free Kindle e book from Amazon.com.
B004ZEWP28|3.0|It isn't much different from the rest of Moby's work.  He seems, to me at least, to get darker as the years go on.  This album is no exception.  The vocal accompaniments were well chosen, and fit the mood of the album.
1594487154|5.0|Dan Pink is an awesome resource for people stuck in a rut. His writing challenges you to think different, and automatically, a byproduct is more creativity, confidence, and joy in whatever type of work you do. The profession of selling has earned a bad reputation in America, probably because of telemarketing and quota-driven high-pressure selling tactics. But we threw the baby out with the bathwater. Mr. Pink reminds us that selling in certain ways could in fact be a sacred art.
0765325950|5.0|As a long time reader of Wheel of Time, I was satisfied with most of the ending that transpired from the collaboration between Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.  I did feel like there should have been a bit more editing, but I think these areas were RJ's original work.  I also feel like a few areas could have had the story fleshed out, particularly Mat's connection with Shadar Logoth and Padan Fain.  Yet, I must say that I have never been more satisfied with the end of a decades long story.  I look forward to revisiting it's places and characters again someday.

B004159Y98|5.0|Damien Rice isn't know for being a prolific artist, I think we can all agree on this point.  There have been two albums produced in what... ten years?  Probably even longer.  However, the quality of his work is phenomenal.  No one can plunge a dagger into my heart quite the way Rice does.

B002O1TMI4|5.0|Is Matthew Bellamy the new Freddy Mercury?  I'm not sure that anyone could replace ol' Freddy, but Bellamy is certainly channeling Freddy Mercury.  The new album is superb - tight lyrical construction, great vocals, and excellent instrumentals.  Five stars!
B0053VKP8S|4.0|Honestly, this worked for my audio setup but it turned out I needed a better sound bar so I returned it. This unit is simple to install and operate in applications that need it. It's good quality construction, too, but a better description of what it does is needed.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Although the first book can keep you on your ties, the added murder mystery in this book kept me from putting it down. I am still struck by the similarities between this series and 50 shades of Grey this book still was a great read.

B009WO7NQO|3.0|I'm not sure why, but this worked much better on my smartphone than my kindle. Everything was pretty much the same except for the lag I found on this version. It would have a slow react time and it would make the game play suffer because of it. Also docked down stars because some levels are impossible to beat without the use of a millenium falcon. When you reset the level you do NOT get them back and when you run out you can sometimes earn more as the game progresses, but ultimately you have to spend out of game money to purchase more to help you in game. That's kinda a rip off in my opinion. What a way to drop the ball Rovio!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is pretty cool but it's harder than the normal temple run. this game gives a good challenge. I love it.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|I needed a white noise alternative to my window fan because I enjoy not waking up to your room being 7 degrees.I tried a bunch of the free equivalents, but they just didn't create the noise I needed. Suddenly, as if it were a Godsend, White Noise is the free app of the day! It's great! I use airplane and hook it up to my surround sound cabinet speakers it works like a charm! Also the alarm s very affective at slowly waking you up as opposed to the typical loud jolt. I recommend this if you're willing to spend money.

B008QTVNUI|3.0|Some of the HBO and Showtime drama series have been fantastic... Sopranos, Game of Thrones... And Entourage, Nurse Jackie, The C Word all really good as dramedies. But I'm having a tough time with Homeland every now and then. Interesting premise, really good acting (Claire Danes is great in her role)<br /><br />But some of the events are a little too &#34;far fetched&#34;. They happen too quickly and are too coincidental as the series goes on, at least Season 1. Im trying to avoid a spolier here, but one of Clarie's relationships and things that she inadvertently reveals to others due to her &#34;affliction&#34; are unrealistic, and seem forced into the series to advance the plot. Without Claire's affliction, some of the things she does or says as a CIA agent are completely unrealistic, in fact. But I guess if she was completely normal, she wouldn't be the same character. I guess it's a trade off.
0425263908|3.0|...it was too similar to 50 Shades of Gray, in my opinion. I did enjoy how the mail female charactor was more strong willed than in the bother book - but I found myself dissapointed in so many similar situations.

081297381X|1.0|A better title for this book might have been The Black Sheep, because 1) Mr. Taleb clearly relishes his role as an outsider, and 2) although the subject of this book is purportedly the unappreciated impact of highly improbable events on our lives, if one were to divine the true subject of a book from the amount of prose dedicated to it, then the subject of The Black Swan is in fact the author himself. The most generous thing I can say about this book is that in those rare moments when the author can pry attention away from himself, he takes us on a slow, meandering, and above all lazy stroll through the halls of empericism . . . a few comments about Henri Poincar&eacute; here, a discursive and not particularly helpful biography of Mandelbrot there, and not a shred of editorial discipline to be found anywhere.<br /><br />The premise of the book is simple enough, as the arguments to support it ought to be. Life does not advance in small increments, but broad leaps, usually ones no one saw coming. See: antibiotics, electronics, democracy, 9-11, etc. And a book composed of a few solidly researched illustrative examples, preferably ones with some interesting characters involved, presented with a concise description of the statistics that are pertinent (or mistakenly believed to be) and explanations for the various applicable fallacies to which the central characters (and we ourselves) fall pray, and voil&agrave;, you might have a convincing bit of social analysis, and perhaps an elevated cocktail party conversation, or who knows? Maybe even a little bit of enlightenment.<br /><br />No. What we get is so sloppily organized it is difficult to describe the narrative structure as anything more than a stream of consciousness. The honest impression I received from this book was that it was not the final product, but rather a journal the author kept in preparation for it, peppered with ideas to be fleshed out (or discarded) later. Even the prose reads like someone's journal. For example, Taleb begins a point with \\"I have just read three 'popular science' books that summarize the research in complex systems,\\" then segues into a synopsis of these books so cursory it's worthless, then abandons them altogether three paragraphs later.<br /><br />The nadir of this book--and I would argue perhaps that of all works of popular social science--is the chapter on Yevgenia Krasnova, an uncompromising novelist whose eventual literary success defied the myopic literary establishment that snubbed her for so long, making her the archetypal Black Swan. The problem with Ms. Krasnova, oddly enough, is that she doesn't exist. Acknowledging here that the success of many books has utterly dumbfounded me (see Fifty Shades of Gray, perhaps the ultimate Black Swan), I believe that I can speak for the majority of the lay-person social science readership when I say that if you are going to presume to tell me how the real world works, you will make a much more convincing argument if you use examples from, oh, let's say the real world. Call me kooky. In addition to her introductory 3 pages, Ms. Krasnova gets an additional two later on, which happen to be the last two pages of the book. I've read various explanations for Ms. Krasnova's appearance in--one might say, intrusion into--this narrative, for example that she represents the author, or you are supposed to be surprised to discover she's not real (if you are me, you are not). I don't care what the excuse is. The body of thought presented in this text does not want for real-world examples with impact; to forego one of those in favor of a figment of imagination, and a not particularly compelling one at that, shows poor judgment at best.<br /><br />Contrast the treatment of this fictional example with that of Long Term Capital Management, the very real ill-fated private trading adventure so egregiously mishandled by Nobel laureates Robert Merton and Myron Scholes. LTCM may best exemplify Mr. Taleb's arguments about the dangers of failing to account for Black Swans, and provides a ripe, low-hanging opportunity for the author to synthesize many of the various loose threads in his book, the handicap of the Gaussian perspective, academic narrow-mindedness, the \\"expert\\" fallacy, etc. None of the points he makes in support of his central thesis, scattered haphazardly as they are among his streams of self-congratulation and vitriol, cannot be brought to bear on the subject of LTCM's demise. The subject merits several chapters. He gives it two paragraphs.<br /><br />In summary: two paragraphs to the modern-day example that might best clarify Mr. Taleb's arguments, and five pages to a fictional author whose story, frankly, would make her the Blackest Swan in history. And a few hundred pages of meandering thought, in which, if the reader can stay focused, one finds odd little gems, like references to the instability of Fannie Mae and the Syrian regime (the original publication of The Black Swan predated both catastrophes). In keeping with Mr. Taleb's distorted sense of apportionment, these subjects get a single casual sentence a piece. If Taleb re-examined his prejudice against prediction, and was inclined to write a book on those two entities, whose dissolutions he clearly foresaw, I'd be interested to know his thoughts. And I would pray, as I opened the book, that he'd gotten much better at organizing them.f failing to account for Black Swans, and provides a ripe, low-hanging opportunity for the author to synthesize many of the various loose threads in his book, the handicap of the Gaussian perspective, academic narrow-mindedness, the \\"expert\\" fallacy, etc. None of the points he makes in support of his central thesis, scattered haphazardly as they are among his streams of self-congratulation and vitriol, cannot be brought to bear on the subject of LTCM's demise. The subject merits several chapters. He gives it two paragraphs.<br /><br />In summary: two paragraphs to the modern-day example that might best clarify Mr. Taleb's arguments, and five pages to a fictional author whose story, frankly, would make her the Blackest Swan in history. And a few hundred pages of meandering thought, in which, if the reader can stay focused, one finds odd little gems, like references to the instability of Fannie Mae and the Syrian regime (the original publication of The Black Swan predated both catastrophes). In keeping with Mr. Taleb's distorted sense of apportionment, these subjects get a single casual sentence a piece. If Taleb re-examined his prejudice against prediction, and was inclined to write a book on those two entities, whose dissolutions he clearly foresaw, I'd be interested to know his thoughts.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|i like this app except it doesnt let you do anything.  the game has the stablehand do everything that is needed to take care of the horses.  i was hoping to buy this game and be able to do everything myself.  it turns out,  all i get to do is feed the horse and somtimes train it for competitions.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I'm a little non-objective with my favorite topic (trek), but i have to say that i wish i had seen more of enterprise.  excellent series, great cast, wonderful story.
030758836X|5.0|Oh, wow! Wow!<br /><br />I very rarely read thrillers, but this book is going to make it to the ones I enjoyed most.<br /><br />I thouroughly enjoyed this book for the past three days and I am sorry it's over, but I had to rush through it for two reasons:<br />1. I couldn't put it down<br />2. It had to be my last book of 2012<br /><br />I am one of those readers who skim quite a bit when reading fiction, esp. mainstream fiction, but this book I read cover to cover, i pondered over her statements, I marvelled over it's philosophies (cool girl, anyone?) and underlined many pharagraphs on my Kindle. And it is not a book I expected to need to underline.<br /><br />It is such a clever book, all the details neatly come together, every detail is of some importance, the writing is straightforward, but amazingly descriptive, the characters are so realistic ( I actually know people like them and I felt like every single one of them from time to time)<br /><br />I loved Amy all the way through and I loved Nick. I wish Go was developed a bit more, though. Her I just liked. The secondary characters were amazing too and not cliched at all, except for, maybe, Amy's lovey-dovey parents, but they were fairly fitting to the story.<br /><br />The ending made sense, too. It wasn't a huge twist everyone was talking about, I didn't see it coming, but I wasn't shocked by it either. It was fitting. The characters were developed enough for me to be able to accept the outcome.<br /><br />All in all, what a great book to complete my 2012 'books read' collection.
0062206044|5.0|Great book at a great price.  Nice to be able to introduce my daughter to Lemony Snicket at such an affordable price.  We haven't read the book yet so can't review but our niece and nephew read them and love the series.  My kids tend to like darker things...like Tim Burton movies and creepy stuff, so I think they will enjoy the dark and fantastical air of this series.
0739344269|4.0|Well-written and concise, this book presents today's most cutting-edge cosmological theories in a way that is understandable to lay-readers.  Does a great job of discussing the history of cosmology as well.  The only thing keeping it from a 5-star review is the insistence on bringing religion into the discussion.  Hawking's presentation of high-level science is impeccable, but his disdain of religious faith grows tiresome.  I wish he would just stick to his specialty.  If you're looking for an easy read discussing today's most interesting astrophysical concepts, and you're not overly religious, this book is a must read.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This (double) CD is pretty good. There are plenty of melodies that will remind you of portions of original trilogy. However, it is not just a re-hash of the soundtracks from the first three. There is a different feel to this one. It is unique. There are a few songs that I'm not a fan of (to the point that I didn't even put them on my iPod), but overall, well worth the money.

B001AQMBKA|5.0|The season showed up as expected in perfect condition. That being said, the content of the disks is certainly worth it. Even if you weren't a fan of every storyline, or every character, the series was good. You can't take that away from it. As such, I'm glad that I can add it to my library.
B00280LYIC|5.0|So i read this book a long time ago but... im writing the review now... yea... ok back to the point.<br /><br />I really like all of Riordan's books especially this one. its a great first book to the heroes of olympus. i think this book is not only exciting but educational. it teaches u some greek mythology... such as the gods goddesses and heroes.<br /><br />THIS IS AN AWESOME BOOK. RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS AND TEENS.

B003ES5ZPK|1.0|The rotating joint near the plug that goes side to side, it doesn't turn to a complete 90 degree angle, it is just short, so it didn't do what I needed.
0307592731|5.0|It's so refreshing to read an inspirational story told in a way that isn't self congratulatory.  This is the way Eat, Pray, Love should have been.  Cheryl Strayed doesn't pity herself or praise herself in the way a lot of memoir writers are prone to do.  It's an easy read without being dumbed down.  I want to go hike the PCT myself now even though it's clear to me that she's a braver an riskier woman than I.  Thank you, Cheryl, for giving me a chance to hike the trail with you.<br /><br />If you haven't read her other book, Dear Sugar, I highly recommend it, too.  It's what made me splurge and buy the hardback book (I never buy books new!).  Both are excellent reads.
B004XQO90E|5.0|I loved this movie!  The end, when things are revealed, was a total surprise to me.  Good acting, good action and overall just a great movie.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This movie met all expectations.  Beautiful scenery, gentle love story with just enough humor.  A movie for the family if accents are not a problem for you to understand.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you are one for love, action, and vengeance then you will not be able to put this book down! Every time I'd say, \\"just one more chapter\\", I would end up taking it back and before I knew it...the book was done! I cannot wait to see what the next book holds!
B003Z0D4S2|1.0|Excellent book although I struggled with the Swedish names of towns & streets.  Great sequel to Larson's 2 earlier bookks with the same characters.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|it is just as fun as all the other versions.<br />im not great at them but i do enjoy them.<br />its not a waste of time.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I have read all of Demille's books and have enjoyed his sense of humour and the action.  However, in The Panther, Demille went overboard to the point that I struggled just to finish the book.  There was hardly a page that his 'humour' didn't appear.  It got very predictable and tiresome.  The book really had very little action and was boring.  I will not buy another of his books without first being able to read a few chapters.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use it everyday and have many friends that I have met over the past 5 years. I suggest if you haven't tried it do so.

076790592X|4.0|Books are a place to learn, to think, and to ponder. Some books can help you gain wisdom and enlightenment. Tuesdays with Morrie is one of those special books. With its honest storytelling and straightforward delivery, it will help you ponder upon your own life. What's truly important for us and have we lived our life the way we wanted it to? Not merely influenced by values created by the society we live in today.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't thing I could love this more than The Hunger Games, but I did.  I enjoyed the love triangle that was going on with Katniss, Peeta and Gale.  The entire story was  very interesting and it sucks you in the moment you start reading.
0735619670|5.0|Every programmer should read this book once a year. It explains how to write good code. No doubt it worths the price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story is very fresh and interesting.  The characters are very likable and you can easily relate to them.  Its well written.  I could barely put it down!
0062127241|4.0|The music history was what I was looking for. What I got was the eternal difficulty and pressure of the creative process; though the songs seem to almost appear effortlessly and the artists enjoy the success, the production process towards the final product is somehow so cruel. Highly educative business wise. Interesting psychological developments and human behaviour. In these kind of books there are always too many girls, too much alcohol and drugs and summa summarum - a bit too little of the rock and roll itself.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I thought this story was unique.  That was the main thing aside from the love story that I liked.  There was a different twist on it as opposed to other love stories.  Just when you were thinking that the two main characters were going to get together finally, there was another twist.  I enjoyed reading this book.
B00979CS50|5.0|There is a place in my mind where these tunes fit in perfectly. They are variations of the same stuff, but I enjoy it because I am wired for this sound.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the plot of the story.  I have never read a book on this particular subject matter, so it was refreshing.  The chemistry between Sky and Holder is wonderful.  Their moments together are so well written and descriptive that I felt like it was happening to me.  If you enjoy love stories, you will like this book.  Holder's love for Sky is so sweet and pure that it makes you want to melt.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its like having. our very own horse ..... we love it. wish it would load faster. but all. and all it is a great game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well written.  Suspenseful.  I could barely put it down.  The ending was emotionally gut wrenching.  I was sad that this was the last book in the series. I wish the plot line of Katniss Everdeen could be expanded upon.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have only read part of the book and am mildly interested in reading the rest.  Maybe it gets better the deeper you get into the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Never seen a Nicholas Sparks book I didn't like and this one didn't disappoint me.  Good read and loved the twist at the end.

B00AHSMDQY|3.0|This was the first movie I ordered on my Kindle -- it was so dark that it was difficult to see in the car where I watched it. In fact, I'm having a hard time remembering the story line at this time. A kindle doesn't do it justice. If you want to watch it, get a bigger screen with better sound available.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This is an OK book. Took awhile to get into. But once you get into it the book is ok
B007VUCAVO|5.0|After buying my kindle I wanted something more than the stock battery indication that was installed in the kindle. There were some negative reviews stating that this app eats battery like crazy or doesn't work or doesn't indicate correctly. I didn't buy the \\"free\\" version of this app because I read some more reviews that the \\"pro\\" one was better for the kindle anyways, so I had to give it a try. In the end, it was well worth it because it doesn't seem like it is draining my kindle's battery life at all, it indicates how much battery I have left if I were to use a function, and when I'm charging, it'll tell me how long it'll take to completely charge the kindle to 100%.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great battery indicator for the kindle (and I'm sure many other electronics that can download this)<br />-Will tell you exactly how long it will take to fully charge the battery (once plugged into a charging cord)<br />-Will tell you how much time left before the battery drains from the functions that you are using (wifi, watching movie, listening to music, etc.)<br />-Easy to understand and navigate through all of the other functions<br /><br />Con:<br />-Well it isn't free (Listed as a con because everyone wants free things)<br />-To fully get the best out of this app, you will need to calibrate it which took around 2 hours on my kindle.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I think this game is one of the best games ever you can just keep playing and playing cause they keep adding more stuff all the time so the possibilities are endless best game ever
B00005JKCH|2.0|Unfortunately this item arrived cracked.  Amazon immediately sent a new one, however the quality of the DVD material was of sub-quality and it cracked again within the first month.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I definitely recommend this book! My second time reading it and it still makes me want to cry or laugh!
B009K45Y62|4.0|I won't comment the movie itself, there are other reviews for that. Just be sure that, if a movie review says TDKR is AWESOME, they're right. If not, it's just plain wrong.<br /><br />The product though is a little less great. The cowl looks good, the artwork and the way they glued is to the base is very good. There's a few scratches, emphasizing the idea of a broken mask.<br /><br />But it's small. It is not the size you think it'll be. There's no way someone could fit a human head inside that cowl. Maybe, just maybe, a baby's head. That's the main problem. Also, the 3 discs come inside the base of the cowl. They fit through an entrance on the back. They are arranged in an awful disc holder, with the 3 discs on top of each other, in a way you'll have to remove the top one to take the bottom one. For the cowl to hold the discs thay invented this holder, which takes just the necessary space to hold the discs. You won't have a standart DVD/Blu-ray cover, and the artwork is too simple.<br /><br />Except for that, it really is a great item to have and show your friends. If I had had the opportunity to see it, and hold it before buying, in a store, I'd have thought harder about buying it or not, but I'd have bought it anyway. I certainly don't regret buying it. For Nolan or TDKR fans, that's a must-have item. Actually, for Batman fans in general.<br /><br />I ordered from Brazil, it took less that 2 weeks to arrive.<br />For portuguese-speakers: portuguese subtitles and audio.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I only read this book after seeing the movie & I loved both book & movie!!! Reality tv used to control the masses is a facinating topic as is the notion of a future society organised & manipulated to the ends of the government. I thought this book was for a younger/teen generation but I honestly couldnt put it down!! Highly recommend
B000VYX8PE|1.0|If you love children, or even like them a little, do not read this book.  If you choose to, read with caution.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I use to bring five dice with me when I travelled because I love Yahtzee do much. It's addictive! And it's also great to play with others, caught up with an old Yahtzee buddy planing with this!

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I've had this headset for 3 years and its quality deteriorated throughout the years. First, some parts of the headset would just come apart very easily. Second, the right side of the headphone no longer had any sound and eventually both sides lost sound.<br /><br />When I took the left earbud apart so I could fix it, I saw that wires were all frail and impossible to fix.
0099579936|5.0|If you get past the surface of this book and read between the lines, you see that it is indeed a very deep story of love and devotion.  Try to get beyond the BDSM part of the book and look deeper.  A love this true is difficult to find and it only gets better in the trilogy.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is a wonderfully entertaining movie. The actors are superb, the settings are lush and the music is outstanding. We chose this based on the number of stars it had, but before that checked out other reviews online.
0345803493|5.0|I was trying to guess what was going to be in the 2nd book and was thrown off base when I actually read the book.  I knew I would have to read the third book in the series.
1451627289|3.0|I became an avid Stephen King reader later in life. Earlier I had only seen the movie versions of which some were quite good like &#34;the shining&#34; but many were of rather low budget made-for-television quality which kept me from investing the time in reading his books. As luck would have it a friend loaned me their copy of &#34;Dream Catcher&#34; which I found to be quite good and have never stopped reading Kings works. Having a strong interest in stories involving time travel, &#34;11/23/63&#34; was quite intriguing for me and being a Stephen King fan put it on my &#34;must have&#34; list. Unfortunetly I didn't feel it was as well written as many of his other books with some parts being totally awesome while other parts seemed rushed and shallow (lets just get this done kind of writting). Kind of like the ending of the dark tower series felt to me. Anyway its worth reading, kind of slow to start and a predictable ending that seems a bit flat. Not to mention quite of bit of King's political ideology seems to have worked its way into the story (which gives the whole work a bit of an off-color in my mind). As far as the Hard-Cover version which I bought, I recommend the soft-cover version instead. The hard-cover is hard to open fully near the beginning and ending due to the stiff binding and the binding side of text can be hard to read because of small margins. The paper seems extra bright and can be glaring under certain types of lighting. I first heard of this book from watching Stephen King give a talk on youtube.com and am glad I purchased it and read it, just wish a little more King-Craft had been used throughout the entire book...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics &amp; I love the jumping games. This is a fun little app for distracting yourself. A blast to play.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson does Robert Jordan justice by helping to finish a very long series of stories from Jordan's notes. I'm sure Jordan's wife played a hand in finishing series too. The book is well written, printed on quality off-white paper (no glare). Has a good feel about it (not too heavy). Must say, Sanderson does Jordan better then Jordan. He doesnt get side-tracked by character clothing and past memories as deeply as Jordan did. Also the Characters finally express personal growth from long history of story line and don't fall back to first book ways of thinking, maybe that's how Jordan wanted them to finally be. I think its still 97% Robert Jordan but with Brandon's sense of timing and narrative style which keeps the book moving along at page-turning pace. I think Brandon's got the same sense of timing which Stephen King is master of: able to flesh things out with just enough meat to set the stage of the readers mind without becoming over-stuffed. One suggestion to the writer and publisher, because of the volume of characters in the series and the extreme use of non-standard names could we see an easy way to look up character names (who they are and how they fit into the story) along with proper pronunciations. Listening to several of the books in the series on CD was a big help (and they are very well produced and read themselves). Maybe the Kindle version has this already? (able to click on something and see a definition...). Many thanks to all who helped with having this wonderful series reach conclusion. I think Robert would be proud of how it all worked out.

B009AMANH4|5.0|Lincoln traces the last few months of the 16th president's life, focusing on his effort to pass the 13th Amendment to the Constitution ending slavery once and for all.<br /><br />Many reviewers have already noted that this is a movie about the US political process rather than the Civil War. But the few brief scenes dealing directly with the fighting - muddy hand to hand combat between black Federal troops and Confederates, Lincoln and his son's visit to an army hospital, and the aftermath a battle outside Richmond - give a powerful sense of the horror of the fighting in that war and the weight that it bore on Lincoln's conscience.<br /><br />The cast of the movie is outstanding and it is difficult to fault a single performance: Tommy Lee-Jones and James Spader deliver scene stealing turns. Jared Harris and David Strathairn less showy performances but no less well judged. And Sally Field brings a great level of sympathy to the role of the often unfairly maligned, though undoubtedly difficult, Mary Lincoln.<br /><br />The centrepiece in this movie is, of course, Daniel Day-Lewis' stunning performance as Lincoln. It is all the more powerful because it is so human: indeed part of Lincoln's greatness arose from his profound humanity and capacity to relate on that level to some of his most intractable rivals.<br /><br />Of course, in spite of Lincoln's efforts, slavery remains a huge problem in the contemporary world. The International Labour Organization estimates that a minimum of 21 million people are in forced labour in every region of the world today. I hope that movie 'Lincoln' inspires this generation of politicians to emulate just a modicum of Lincoln's political and moral courage when they are doing their jobs, and to take positive steps to end slavery once and for all in our lifetimes.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|If you are a WWII history buff, you will love this read.  It approaches the war & related issues from the human side.  Absolutely fantastic!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Getting to age now where the eye sight and other parts are failing.  Sympathized with Clint's character.  Good movie with a daughter and father.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Got this for my daughter and I am playing it more than her! A lot of fun and very realistic!
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Strange movie and strange plot but liked it a great deal.  You have to check out the symbolism and hidden messages.  Watch him morph to a wolf at the end.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's Star Wars themed and awesome with the new bird features. Not to mention you can use the Millennium Falcon to wreck stuff.
0345803485|5.0|Emotional roller-coaster of all kinds, heart pounding love. Not what I expected it to be. Mild mild, just passion passion. The end was surprising and makes me want to read book two right away! 4 to 5 stars
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|After hearing a bunch of raving about this movie I had to watch it. It is hilarious. I really enjoyed it and I can see myself watching it over and over.
B0085W09ME|5.0|Just started using it and it seems very easy to navigate. I like being able to filter out airlines that I don't fly with.
B00APJLEGA|4.0|This is a cute story and everyone in our family enjoyed it.  We parents did and so did our 21 month old and our 8 year old.  We had lots of laughs!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I saw the movie so listening to the soundtrack just makes me feel like I'm in the theater again!  Amazing music!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is sooooo cool ;) I cant really write any more so imma be random...... taco.....burrito........ truck........ horse..... wolf....... shadow...... Vikings......
B00B2V66VS|2.0|its fun but on kindle fire it freezes up and u have to x out and wen u go back on it makes u REDO the tutorial and does the same thing and then when i try to turn the tutorial off it freezes up AGAIN...i dont recommend this to people getting this on kidle fire or kindle fire hd
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't say enough...it is simply great television.  There is nothing about this show that offends, a rarity in television today.
0812993292|2.0|While well written, I did not feel like I connected with Harold's character. His trip was unlikely and the characters he met along the way were often unbelievable. The shock value of the &#34;reveal&#34; at the end was unsavory. This book was on our book group list or else I would not have read it.
B008BM9L72|4.0|I found  all three books good to read . must admit starting reding it to see what all the fuss was about and found i enjoyed the story line.. I know a lot of people looked for the mummy porn as they were explaining it but if you look past it there is a good story line  but you do need to read all 3 books to understand it
B009RI4FRU|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of my time and money.  My guest nor I found it entertaining. I would not give it any stars however it appeared necessary in order to write the review.  I bought it because of it's 4 star rating which baffles me.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Will and Tommy are both great in this funny and action packed movie!  Very clean too by today's standards for the whole family.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|In John Greens book, The Fault in Our Stars I really connected with each character and felt like I was on their journey with them. I chose this book because all my friends kept begging me to read it and they were also telling me how amazing it was. The story line that John Green chose to write was about a seventeen-year-old girl named Hazel. Hazel was more then just a seventeen-year-old girl. She had a disability throughout her life and she wasn't ready to live it with her cancer. She would stick at home with her mom and she didn't have many friends. She went to a weekly Support Group where she talked about her cancer with others. There at the Support Group she meets a boy named Augustus Waters. Little did she know that this boy could change her life.  Augustus changes Hazel's mind about the cancer and really gets her up and going. It was like a roller coaster, Ups and Downs. Like the times where Hazel and Augustus would just hang out as regular teenagers, not talking or complaining about cancer. Or when they go on an amazing journey together. I love a good fiction book but I have never found one as good as this one. Reading this book during class and or at home I never wanted to put it down. It was such a page-turner. Just seeing where or what Hazel and Augustus would do next. Augustus and Hazel seemed like they were alive in my life. John Green really made me feel like I was there with them, through every part in the book. His book really connects people, parents, kids, teenagers, everyone! Although it was a sad book it was also very exciting and happy. I recommend this book to 8th graders and above. Many young kids will not be able to understand some of the big vocabulary in the book and also some of the inappropriate words. Of course there were tears but they were always followed by a laugh. If you are interested in an exciting unpredictable teenage love story kind of book then you must stop what you are doing and read The Fault in Our Stars, you will not regretit.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is so better then temple run 1 and the monkey is so big and that there are is a rope.
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|I did not think that the game was as easy to play as I would have hoped.  Do not use it much now.
B003UESJHE|5.0|A really good movie, I can understand why Colin Firth won the best actor oscar for his performance.The other actors were very good also.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is fun, and while many of the games are sort of easy, a few are really challenging.  You earn points as you play that allows you to unlock more games.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Bought for my wife. She loves it. Looks like a book cover. Really nice looking cover, just so it lasts with all the use.
0811879631|5.0|This book was on my son-in-law's wish list for Christmas.  It's a great book on Pixar.  It was received in time for Christmas and in good shape.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|This is a good fast paced horror movie. If you liked the other Resident Evil movies you will like this one, too. The delivery was fast which I always appreciate.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Not up to Flynns quality of work. His other books are far better. I hope he returns to the writing style of his previous books.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS SPECTACULAR, AMAZING, EVERYTHING IN THIS SUPERB!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT ANF IT WAS SOOO HILARIOUS!!!! ESPECIALLY FAT AMY... LOL... ANYWAYS.... BUY IT!!!!! IT'S A W E S O M E!!!!!! I LOVE IT!! ;)
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game if one of the main reasons why I got a ps Vita and I do not regret it.<br /><br />For those that have never played persona 4, be in for a real treat as you embark on a journey with the main character killing shadows, crushing cards all whilst going out with 6 different girls, punching your friend in the face, talk about murder and listen to inappropriate cheery music for the game.<br /><br />For those that have already played the game, you get to try the new persona's (and old like OP Yoshitsune.) as well the many new cool functions like combo moves with Chie and Yukiko, back-up on bikes and new social links. Alongside this is the new Okina city alongside the new wadrobe.<br /><br />This game does not and will not change my already opinion on the persona series for being tough and fun. Just go out there and face yourself.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Funny, hilarious, and hysterical is the only way I can describe this show. I have all the seasons to date and can't stop watching them.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|this is mislabeled as a thriller. it's (i think) a documentary which was very interesting to watch , however disturbing.  makes you think twice about who you're talking to on FB!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Application is great: Many sound choices:  Runs great with no problems on my Acer A500 Tab: I highly recommend this app to anyone that wants to get a good nights rest!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This run is a lot more challenging,  but it so much fun. I like the objectives that are set. It gives me something to &quot;run&quot; for. However,  I don't like the use of coins when you use the objectives or powerups.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|will rate it higher when i have it a little longer, right now to early to tell, seems nice but will wait
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Thanks to Amazon for getting this app! There are so many apps that Amazon doesn't have, and I was hoping they would have this. Sure enough, they did! I've played this and it is a must-have! It's way more fun then the regular temple run. This one surpasses Temple Run.<br />Temple Run 2 all the way!<br />Thanks again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great tv show makes you wanna watch the next episode every time you finish one. enjoy the nail biting drama.
1439170916|4.0|I bought this book because my 15-year old granddaughter, who is interested in science, asked for it as a Christmas gift, and I wanted to see what she was reading.  It is a fascinating record of the battle against cancer and provides insight into the effort that has gone into discovering each drug that has worked to subdue this enemy.  Progress has been made but there is so much more that needs to be done.  It is not light reading but it is worth the effort.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I am not sure if because of a language problem or because the movie was so dark (as it is indicated in its name) I didn't understand an enjoy this movie.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|my husband and I read The Maze Runner and really enjoyed it - it was a litte new, different and keep you wondering how they would figure out the maze.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I think every mother and daughter should watch this wonderful movie. It is very much inspiring. It shows how a mother and a daughter should understand each others' world.
B0031TZASY|4.0|Great story.  Purchased to read on Kindle while traveling.<br /><br />The story is well written and engaging.  I couldn't put it down, nice to have the Canadian influence as well.<br /><br />The catch, the kindle version was SUBSTANTIALLY more expensive than a paper back version.  Seriously, no shipping, no handling, no printing.  Its ridiculous. Unfortunately the Kindle is the only way I can carry 14 books with me on a trip to a non english speaking country and not be over weight.<br /><br />The costs of progress.
B000GWE44U|5.0|I loved it I am not sure why I have waited so long to watch this classic movie but it worth to watch. I scared though : ) I think because it is a very old movie and very slow I was okay to watch usually I am scared of horror movies. It is old style to scare people with axes and physical harassment. Nowadays the most scare movies are all about the brain movements.
B00377V2M8|5.0|Being in my 60's, I remember when music &#34;got loud&#34;, and when &#34;regular rock&#34; became &#34;acid rock&#34;.  This video vividly conveyed the concept of &#34;it's in my head&#34; and how the music came to be composed.<br />This movie, seen at the behest of our 30-something son, was a pleasure.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this new temple run is soooo awesome! :-) it keeps you on the edge of your seat especially that monkey is really scary... all the new graphics I have to give an A+ too. its way better than the first one were your on the same road the whole time :-p
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|granted, I haven't read the comics so I can't say how close this movie came but it was pretty good. I wouldn't recommend it if your squeamish about blood and gore.
B0063GORYU|3.0|i have tried this game  only once so it is not fair for me to write anything about this product.  i liked it when i used it but have been doing traditional solataire more.
B003BWERF8|2.0|It will not pair with my car audio system (VW Touareg 2013). I did intensive research and still no answers. IT works great with Bluetooth  stereo head set though.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game to play.  My only criticism would be having to buy the gems with real money.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is really nice design also more challenging. I love it. Also it make me crazy and find a path.
B00A757EFW|3.0|It's pretty neat. It takes a bit to get used to moving pac-man in this new way, but I would definately say it's a must-have for those who grew up with Pac-Man on earlier video games.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I would have scored it higher but I don't like the auto fill on names. It's inaccurate because not all typed names are friends on facebook. It clears out and will not allow you to finish typing the name of your choice. Otherwise I like the app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Definately a must have for any horse lover. So many things you can do with your horse! So realisitc. The look and movement of the horse is more realistic than I have ever seen on any other video game or computer game.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|We loved this movie. Saw it in the theater, ordered the DVD as soon as it was available others may pan it for not being Jason Bourne, but I think it stands well on its own. There is enough material from previous Bourne incarnations to fill in the back story, but then it takes off on its own. The ending is left open enough to allow for further exploration into the Bourne world, but was satisfying enough to close the movie successfully.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great if you're antsy or edgey and need to get otu some nervous energy. Great if you're frustrated and want to slice the heck out of some fruit. All around great game. Good sound effects and neat splattering effects, too.
B002VWNID6|3.0|We loved this movie and watched it several times. However, this was a cheap copy sold as original. The playback stopped halfway through and we had to flip the disc to watch the second half. The disc was relatively inexpensive, so I guess we got what we paid for. Do your research before purchasing a disc. Make sure you get an original copy from the production house or you could be in for random surprises like this.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Works great! Just like the case on my i-pad.  Excellent price too.  Will definitely order another if we get another kindle.
B002I9Z8I0|3.0|I bought this set for my husband for Christmas. While we both enjoyed the boxed set, we both noticed into the first movie that several scenes were missing, and noticed into the following movies that scenes were from all the others as well. I am not sure why those scenes were deleted from the set, but they were missed and I wish I had done a little more research before purchasing them.
B001J9EHSC|5.0|one of my titles of all time.<br />Amazing how it brought me right back to that time in my life  yet also resonates with me in the here and<br />now.
B005CMGKTG|2.0|The DVD didn't work very well - the visuals blinked on and off repeatedly. I was unable to get the Setup screen to display. In spite of that, when I finally got the English subtitles turned on, the second line ran off the bottom of the screen and was unreadable. I debated returning the DVD for another, but feared getting an equally bad second copy.<br /><br />Nevertheless, as a big Star Blazers fan, I stuck it out to watch the movie. The costumes and characters were true to the original but would have benefited from a little updating. Very little was made of the space battleship Yamato itself, disappointingly. I'm glad I saw it, but I threw the DVD in the trash when I was finished watching.
B005PR2FD8|5.0|I thought the movie was cool. I am a fan of Tekken since it came out. I wish they had more movies. I love the games. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes anime. The fight scene at the end was pretty cool. I wish there was more of it.
0984183523|5.0|Victor does an excellent job in this book. His issue tree method is excellent for good thinkers that can solve cases using their own intuition and judgement. If you want a more cookie cutter approach (which by the way will get you bounced from MBB) go with Consentino's frameworks. They are a solid foundation but must be absorbed and then integrated into your thinking process. Never regurgitate a framework if you actually want the job. Victor does an excellent job in walking you through the logic of the hiring process as well as the job. This leads the reader to the necessary mindset that allows them to succeed.<br /><br />If you are just getting going, please start live practice ASAP. Read this as you practice. This is no substitute for practice.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|I chose this case because of its ability to adjust angles while viewing on a solid surface. It does require you to unhook and flip the tablet around if you need to leave it on the charger and if you forget to reflip it around when you are done the automatic closure/power doesn't always work properly.This is more of a kindle deficet than a marware issue I feel though. It is a durable case with an elastic closure for added security. Affordable and bright color with a textured outer case. lovely.
B008VJYWMY|5.0|LOVE Il Divo.  This is just another one of their great albums.  Love the new addition &#34;My Heart will go on&#34;.  We were fortunate to be able to see them live in concert in Seattle in 2012.  The highlight of the year for me.  The ONLY comlaint I would have with them is they don't do enough songs in English.  It would make it so much easier to enter in with what they are singing.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love, love, love this movie.  If you enjoy watching talented people sing, you will really enjoy this film.  The characters are fun and funny and really likable AND (drumroll here) if you are a bit starched in the knickers, you'll be happy to know that this film is one of the least offensive comedies they've put together years.  There was some vomit (okay more vomit than I've ever seen in a movie).  There was some sexual innuendo, but overall, unlike most movies that supposedly portray college students, it didn't stuff sex and sexuality down the viewer's throat.  It didn't push any envelopes in my opinion.  It is much more appropriate for television than \\"Glee.\\"<br /><br />Yes, the storyline is pretty predictable.  Within the first five minutes you will have the entire plot figured out and there really won't be any real surprises, but you will STILL enjoy watching it all come to pass with some really fun musical numbers thrown in.  I've watched the audition scene more times than I can count and even my husband will watch it over and over again with me.  Now that is saying something!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game.  Everyone I know who has tried it loves it.  My nephew has this on his phone and we compete to see who can get more achievements.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|If you liked the first one you are going to like this one as well.  Same game play principles and a few new surprises.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|What does work, seems to work great yet many of the videos stop short. I also seem to have trouble with &#34;now playing&#34;; it doesn't play what is now playing on my kindle. I did read about some limits with the android OS but it still appears that now playing doesn't really mean what is now playing. If I could get what is playing on the kindle or TV to stream to the TV, this would be a perfect program. I also thought it would be able to link my computer files to the TV but haven't found that feature yet. I'm not sure why the videos in the catalogs are all chopped short either; are they supposed to be teasers? I may need to spend more time with it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Would have liked to see he story line written a bit longer- it's such a good series! I fully enjoyed it although I did get lost during chapter 25 since I thought it was a dream.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|This is something I would watch on TV for free when I'm bored.  Not to thrilled about spending actual money on it.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 year old loves this app and the truck & car app as well. He can finish the puzzles very easily, but he loves completing them and popping the items afterwards. He can even back out of the puzzle and go select the one he wants to do. Never had an issue with a request to purchase the full version. The free puzzles cycled through and when it was done sent me back to the main screen & we started over. I also don't allow my children to play on the kindles without supervision or frequently. These will both be great apps for them to play when we are waiting at appointments or anywhere else I need them to be quiet.
0765325950|5.0|As far as building a world up from scratch and bringing it to an epic climax, nothing has ever topped this. I doubt anything ever will.<br /><br />It is worth reading all the books of the series just so you can enjoy the EXQUISITE culmination. (In the same way that it is worth devoting your life to physics just for the culminating few minutes in which you grasp quantum mechanics).
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I use this app to compare prices while shopping in a local stores for price matching.  I wait to use my laptop to actually place an Amazon order and further research the items I'm considering purchasing.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|It was very disappointing. A few laughs here and there, but overall not that great. I would not recommend this movie.
B0060MYM7O|2.0|Read first two books in series, found they pretty much fizzle out at that point, do not find the HBO series much better. Cannot recommend books or the show. Long series of books that results in a waste of my valuable time, as I sure this series looks to be if they keep making them.
0765325950|5.0|I'm still blown away and processing, but I loved this book. Even though there was so much military tactics which isn't something I particularly enjoy, but the story arcs are there.<br /><br />And for those criticizing the ending, Brandon Sanderson didn't come up with this plot, he took it from Jordan's notes.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This second in the series was the most interesting and kept your interest. It was fast paced and a good continuation of the story.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Excellent muscians and very genuine - lyrics are wonderfully crafted and weaves a beautiful picture....they are very gifted at storytelling and draws the audience into their world which basically is the same, everyday world we live in....
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I downloaded Temple Run in June 2012 and enjoyed the game. Once I saw Temple Run 2, I immediately downloaded this game in January 2013 to see if it was as good as the first. It is and I like the challenge it give you and I can't stop. I did not find any flaws as of yet.<br /><br />Aaron M
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Excellent playing and lyrics - not imposters - just genuine people who write genuine lyrics that make you think....and you can place yourself in any of their songs....they hit home but don't politicize or stand on a soapbox...preaching their brand<br />of humanity...
B0037B6QSY|3.0|The theme of mindfulness is to pay attention to your emotions, your body, your mind and your surroundings.  The concept is intruiguing but the self help suggestions in this book fall short in some areas.  Add this book to your &#34;maybe' list.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Had to buy it for my daughter she wanted to watch something with her daughter that was her and I.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a great app i loved temple run and had done almost everything so this is even more fun
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Despite the constant obstacles they face Sky and Holder prevail and support each other. There are more turns and twists to this plot than a bowl of spagetti and it is just as satisfying!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I knew that I would not forget it. Suzanne Collins expertly describes the lain , the hunger and the love between peers Latinas and everyone else. You feel for the characters, you know them. When a death happens you feel a stab in your heart  Suzanne Collins has created a dystopian world full of survivor and rebels and lovers and enemy's.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|i love adobe reader and i will always want to use it.It helps me a lot when using my kindle
B007SGM084|3.0|Not really what I was expecting. The style of writing is very similar to that of the Twilight books. It was very predictable, makes for an interesting read if you're bored I guess.
B004QBWU02|5.0|Born in 1951 and doing my share of street racing this movie was right on and much of it was just like the way the nights went. Picking up runs at A&W Cruising the circuit as to say and not geting back home entill the sun was comming up. WOW the memories are still there and yes the hot rod did come into town looking for the fast car in the area. Many times he got beat but we never had an ending like this and glad we did not but the acting here is spot on but 1967 to 1973 I was playing out this role and am glad I had the chance. One of my favorite movies and have watched it a dozen times and will see it many more.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|O think that the coolest book about the yt? typically trying to get a book about the most popular stories of a book about the most popular stories of a book about the most popular stories of a book about the most popular stories of a book about the most popular stories of a book about the most popular stories of a book about the most popular stories of a book about the most popular has a book that he thinks the coolest book and truly a chance of a centres for the most popular stories photos videos people are not be able to mention the coolest book and truly is a book that he was a chance to be the coolest book about it because of a Centres in the most common type in your life is a good thing is that he was not good enough for me is not a chance to be able and the ti to be a chance for the same time of the same thing is that it was not good idea that the coolest book about the most important part of this was good for you to get to be able the most important that he is the most common sense that it because it is the same thing is not the only way.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 8-year old daughter loves this app. I like it because it teaches her things as she interacted with the game. The only downside is that sometimes the game is &quot;unresponsive &quot; and she has to cancel out of the app. The graphics are amazing,  though so a hicup or two doesn't surprise me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy had me stuck from the first chapter of book 1! Recommended to everyone that can take a little gore and imagination :)
B008KMHFJY|5.0|would really like to know what's in plan for they future and happens to them if they last or not
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this temple run is more addictive than the first in my oppinion the only thing I do not like about it is the amounts in the stores other than that this app will egg you on to play it in conclusion you should get this FREE APP you will be supprised there are more obbsticles to help you keep entertained and there is a beautiful new setting of what I think is China the new obsticles are mine cart and zipline and instead of a bunch of demons there isone gigantic monkey! GET THIS APP!!!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This season is not for the faint of heart. Gory in some places.. This season is much darker than season 1, and has almost no humor.. I like it but not for everyone
B003TSEEDY|2.0|This book had me turning from page to page, however, it didn't make that much sense to me nor had much interest. I expected a lot more and don't think I would recommend this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Don't get this app if if can't afford to get lost in challenges. Big Duck Games are obviously puzzle pushers and this is their mind-expanding/mind-altering experience. Oh, what-the-heck--plug in, play, tune out.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It was REALY bad. I Couldn't go to a page quickly. Don't buy it but you probably already have it.
1594744769|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it was a new author for me, but I really enjoyed it, it was a page turner for me and I loved how he put the pictures with the book. I was a very well laid out story and executed beautifully.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldnt put down this book.  It was very captivating.  I found myself thorough engrossed as if I were apart of the games
B00A820UF0|5.0|I love this book. If you call it that. Its a stunning pictorial of the mass effect universe.  On my kindle fire I am unable to expand the picture's.  Making it difficult to read the small text. Picture's are terrific.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, I brought it everywhere with me and even read in the shower. I would recommend to everyone and anyone!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I am so addicted to this show and every time I watch \\"The Big Bang Theory,\\" it's characters and storyline never ceases to make me LOL.<br /><br />I own all the series and I watch \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" everyday;  it helps me to relax after a stressful day.....It's my Valium!!!
B000LGZHDS|3.0|I purchased this to be part of a group for a baby shower:  Little boys are made of frogs, snails, and puppy dog tails.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this app very much its like having the horse in could never have in the city. Sometimes it glitches though that's the annoying. part of the game.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|There have been many, many books written about the 2005-2009 financial collapse and this one is certainly one of the more entertaining. I was pleased to read that it wasn't simply a rehash of the large players in the markets at the time and it really was entertaining to know more about the \\"second level\\" of participants. The style of writing is great and it's a fast paced read but I really question what is the reader going to do with this infomation? The beauty of the markets is that history repeats itself and hopefully you can take advantage of the next time a \\"black swan\\" event happens. I have enjoyed a few of Lewis' other books and this one does seem to be a bit more detailed and specific to readers with immense desires to understand the inner workings of the last financial calamity.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am enjoying this Bible app. I love the choices it gives to read through the Bible. I would highly recommend it. I look forward to spending time using it during my daily Bible study.
B00AW0KHMY|1.0|Just the end credits would be fine by me as I tend to skip those anyway. Just a suggestion .
B00095NX9G|5.0|Not only do you learn dance techniques and choreography you get an amazing workout. I thought I was in good shape but I still cant get through the whole program in one go. Strength and endurance will be tested daily with this one. But the results are soooo worth it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this game. Quite simple, but not easy. The sound track is not at all annoying. I like that I have to be persistent. New players note that you need to take note of the level and frame set you are at in order to use YouTube videos for hints.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This movie series is incredible and everyone knows that...with that being said it is even cooler to see it in blue ray with superior quality in sound and picture. This series needs to be seen by anyone who likes inspiring war movies.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|The story was a wonderful escape from the 21st Century, to a time that was very real, albeit &#34;make believe&#34; from today's world. The plot was spellbinding and the images precise. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Upgraded my gaming rig. My computer now has the following specs:<br /><br />I5-3570k Overclocked to 4.3 GHZ<br />16 GB DDR3 RAM<br />256 GB SSD<br />AMD 7970 3 GB video card<br /><br />My old rig was similar, only using an AMD 1055T running at 3.4 GHZ.(6 core processor) This processor is snappier and faster in every regard, including encoding movies, music and gaming. No regrets. I love AMD, but you can't beat Intel these days.<br /><br />***EDIT*** 2-21-2016<br />Three years, and still going strong. I really see no reason to upgrade.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book has a great story line! I love the way this author handles retrospect, and the vividness of the descriptive passages. In my mind, I can clearly see the little cottage on the cliff.
B003AMAOW4|3.0|I am a great fan of Jonas Kaufmann and his singing of Lohengrin is what I'd hoped.  But the production is beyond ridiculous--makes Kaufmann look like Jed Clampett.  And he enters carrying! the swan and departs carrying! the swan.  Germans should not be allowed to stage Wagner.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|And I thought the first one was good...I love the new editions to this new game like the pipeline... I would definitely recommend getting this app!!
B000YCLRBA|5.0|I liked this performance enormously--both Fleming and Hvorostovsky are ideal, visually and vocally.  If only Fritz Wunderlich were alive to sing Lensky, it would prove there is a God.
B004UG7RQ0|3.0|The product works fine.it is of adequate length. Five stars for functionality! But it is basically an extension cord... A very expensive extension cord!!! For that I give it three stars overall! Shame on Apple for allowing/causing this to occur...
B0051YKUYG|5.0|The best one she has done and our favorite DVD Great variety. A perfect balance of her music.  She has put out many good videos, but this is still her best one.
B0098WVT9W|5.0|Loved the album.<br /><br />It's truly amazing how Lee Ritenour blends the old with the new in a very pleasant way. Not even mentioning the caliber of musicians involved!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a fun place to share your hobbies, thoughts and advice.  I can spend hours here. I like Pinterest more than Facebook now!
0525953728|3.0|It was an interesting description of what actually took place, but the writing sucked. Maybe he should have paid the editor a little more? I trudged through the first half of the book- but the real story didn't start until half way through. IMHO it loses two stars for bad writing and a lame first half of the book.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|I have owned this watch for a few months now and it has quickly become my everyday wear.  Very high quality, easy to read dial and it looks great.  I frequently get comments on it from friends thinking it was a much more expensive purchase.  I place it in the window for a couple hours of sun once per month and have never had an issue.  Excellent watch for the price
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can only speak for the first two episodes of Season 3, but Downton never fails to disappoint.  If you enjoy period dramas (with a bit of soapy undercurrents), you will love this series!  I think the acting is superb, unlike your typical overdramatization of a typical evening soap.  I have watched the first two series (on BluRay) over 10 times - yes, I'm that much of a fan.  I am sure I will enjoy the rest of Season 3 as soon as I receive the soon-to-be-released BluRay.  Keep 'em coming....
1118109791|5.0|An absolute must, it is critical to know go through this guide.  It is by far the most representative of what you need.
B000002P74|5.0|Southern rock at its finest, strong tempo with the lyrics to match. Brought back many memories are parties with friends.
B0071QIN00|5.0|I loved this game, played it all the way through.  I love the basic game play but challenging levels.  I look forward to future releases.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful storyline that keeps you reading. Makes you want to not put the book down til you are finished reading it.
B005CAATXG|5.0|After many plays on YouTube, I owed this band a purchase of their Cd.  They sing things honestly and don't feel the need to be vulgar, which appeals to me.  I'm no music critic, but I like the mix of rock and some electronic influences in this album.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is amazing because it is not just fump and slide it is way more. it gets your brain working hard
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved the story line.  the graphics were wonderful. this is coming from an eighty one year old who really likes to play games.
B0055X6V4Q|5.0|My son recommended this book and I can't wait to read it.  If he says it is good, it is!!!!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|i grew up on this movie,have always loved it,i wish they would show it every christmas for everyone to see.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is fantastic. It is so much fun to run. I would recommend this to anyone. Get it now! Get it now.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|my son is 24 now but he has always been a gremlins fan,so i got it for him for christmas just like he asked. when i go see him there's him & his buddies sitting around watching gremlis laughing there butts off. so i would say this is a boys to a mans movie.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app aloes me to make my own everything. I have issues that I cant say at work. I can jot them down and lock them with a password.  I have saved so much money by using this app because I do not need posts it. all my to do list are right here at a view that I can make work for me. this is one free app that I will never get rid of. best part no ads, and no purchase this to get that. again awesome
B00003CX8N|5.0|This heartwarming movie chronicles the friendship formed between 2 business people over a love of books.  Anne Banncroft is one of my all time favorite actresses.  The repartee between Banncroft's &#34;acerbic tongue&#34; and Hopkin's &#34;calm rationale manner&#34; makes this movie.  Any book lover will enjoy this flick.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first book and Like this one. I would definitely recommend reading this book. Looking forward to the next one.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|A remarkable experience, written with a sense of purpose.  I think everyone should read Mrs. Moorjani's book and feel it's uplifting, enlightening message.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Timeless Classic Inspirational Ineffable. The singers corruscate through the high notes and embalm your senses with the low. The best!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good book needs more emotion but i guess i did enjoy it as much as i could have. Great Book!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|What can I say?  I'm about as hooked as anybody can be.  Just stting back and enjoying the ride.  I
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was seemed too good to be true. I got all 3 of the latest batman movies on blu-ray with extras for one low price. The digital download into VUDU was extremely easy and fast. Not a fancy collector type setup but I got more than I bargained for.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Great history, costumes, story line - actors were great - the sets were unbelievable, I was glued to the end.  I
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Sparks is an incredible author and I cant  wait to read another one of his books.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I got into the story line right away - I can't say enough about the actors and the scenery - spent many hours in AC
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. It features new obstacles such as zip lines,rivers,coal mines,and much more. The quality of the game is much clearer and the sensitivity is great!!!!!!!!! I totally recommend getting this app but if you didn't already try Temple Run before this you should so it's not as hard.=)
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Not much to say except it's great, entertaining, keeps you glued to the tv.  Love all the actors, great story line - can't wait for the next se
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was very interesting  and a little more complicated than I presumed it to be. Overall I enjoyed it! Good book!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I was listening to K92 one night and when I turned it on I was listening to the end of Little Talks. I loved it! The Next Night I listened to the Radio for hours, just waiting to see if it would come on again So i could know what it was called or who it was by, When it Finally Came on I repeated the song over, and over. And then I started singing in myself, Last night I decided to Get on Amazon and looked up their Band and CD. I listened to it and loved it! I've never Really liked indie Rock type of stuff Till I listened to This and the Hunger Games CD. They're Fantastic! Their Songs are a little Somber I agree. But If You're in The mood for that kind of stuff Then you should DEFINITELY get it! Its actually inspired me to start singing myself :D  12/10
B005LAII3U|3.0|I got this movie knowing i would like the movie.  But, the premise and the writing didn't hold up.  There was almost too much special effects.  Granted the writers threw a bone to the original by mentioning Mars.  However, this movie didn't take place on Mars.  The plot line went a completely different direction than the original.  Other than the Recall machine awakened a secret agent.  It was OK, but I'll take the original over this.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|A complete waste of my time but I love it.  Gives me something to do when I don't want to get involved in a book or another game .  I'm finding ways to make it challenging by getting as many prizes as I can!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run really outdid itself with this latest edition of the game.  Imangi Studios did a really nice job of keeping he game like the original Temple Run feel but making exciting changes that really defines the 2nd version.  All around great game!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|These &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; books really are &#34;50&#34; shades of complete and utter female fantasy. For those<br />who are into or need that, I'm sure they're great......just not for me.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Worth reading.  Check out the earlier books in this series before jumping into this.  Probably not a good entrance in to this series.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My son loves it, that's all that matters. I catch myself watching it at times too. It is better than a lot of things he watches.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|This is in some ways a delightful book.  It's incredibly detailed in its technical aspects, and the inventiveness of the hero is quite wonderful to watch.  There's a continual vein of sardonic humor running through, and a nice sense of suspense at the cascading disasters that occur.<br /><br />That said, this is a nerd's book.  It is driven almost entirely by the mastery of technical details, which are set forth more like engineering term papers (wait, were there even papers in Engineering?  I was an English major...) than story narrative. There is a modicum of  fairly one-dimensional characterization layered on top of it, and a plot that consists of an almost predictable chain of catastrophes.  It fits a small niche of technically-driven science fiction but lacks any of the breadth and depth of much of the genre.<br /><br />I'm fascinated by the mass of 5-star reviews, given that (a) this is a book that appeals primarily to our technical side and (b) sic-fi reviewers are by and large a pretty critical lot.  Interesting.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is really fun, and I do enjoy it. I think that it is a good game for children and adults, people of all ages. I like it a lot, but there are a few minor flaws, mainly having to do with young children.<br /><br />LIKES:<br />- Game is a challenge, harder than the original temple run, but not too hard.<br />- All of the new things, like sliding on ropes and the way things have changed.<br />- Things are way more cheap (characters all have varying prices, and all are low. Price varies on characters skill.)<br />- All powerups are already available, no having to pay to unlock them<br />- Being able to reincarnate at all times<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />- The way the new monkey demon moves/looks (It gave my 5 year old sister nightmares)<br />- Coins are extremely hard to get<br />- Very sensitive, when part of the path is gone you must tilt your android very hard<br />- The way your character thrashes as he is eaten (Did no help at all with sisters nightmares)<br /><br />Overall, I would rate this game as very fun and entertaining, other than the incredibly small flaws listed above. If you were a fan of the original temple run, (like me!) I highly suggest this game. :)
0385535147|4.0|John Grisham wonders,in his book,\\"The Racketeer\\", why more Federal judges don't get murdered given their penchant for sentencing criminals for crimes against the federal government-many of the sentences too harsh to fit the crime.In fact he points out that there were only 3 federal crimes when the constitution was drafted- counterfeiting,treason and piracy. Now there are over 3000 to keep federal attorneys busy and give them a reason for existence.<br />  Grisham writes his best tales when he is on the side of the man on the street taking on giant establishments. 'The Racketeer' gives him this opportunity in this complexly plotted tale about a wronged African-American lawyer serving time for a federal crime he did not commit and who tries to strike a deal with the feds to reveal the name of the killer of a Federal judge.<br />  The writing is free flowing,the plot is full of predictable and unpredictable turns and the narrative is fast paced.Though it does get bogged down briefly midway,it picks up pace and the complexity of the plot makes it worth a second read as well.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Almost like a demo, very short and the controls felt sticky on it, maybe the pay version is better. Not recommended.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Schöne APP, die Süchtig nach mehr macht. Habe bisher gegen Langeweile Sudoku gespielt, jetzt spiele ich nur noch Color Me.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|i choose this rating because i like this game i have no dislikes about this game i recommend this game to everyone
B005KC3SDY|5.0|This book was great! Although I don't like horror that much, this version for children was alright and I really enjoyed it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i like this game i am totally hooked on this game i have been playing all weekend long and today
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was an amazing read because it wasn't overly repetitive, there was great detail a and simply a attractive story. It was hard for me to put the book down. I enjoyed how it shared some characteristics as fifty shades of grey but was also wildly different. I cannot wait to read Reflected in You and continue the story of Eva and Gideon. If you loved fifty shades you must read the crossfire series. It isn't as submissive and dominate relations as fifty shades but still amazing in its entirety.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome job of the monkey! And the cart I love it when you get on the track five stars rated
B004O7EVLY|5.0|Its all good man. Dig it! So Sweden knows what is going on with blues/metal. Who knew? Everything I have heard from this group is right down the road I want to go.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|Could not get it to stand up with the kindle in it. Would not stay in the slot and always falls down
B00B2V66VS|5.0|fantastic. temple run 1 was great but this supersedes any expectation. I love it more than the first one and I thought that was impossible!
B000ZOW96Y|5.0|This is the third movie in the series and it doesn't disappoint. It was a great movie with a stellar cast!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|im reading the books in order<br />I like books with awsome pictures and that its a diary<br />i love diary of a wimpy kid
0321344758|5.0|This book is an amazing reference book to help with building web pages that are built with the consumer in mind. Great book, I reference it all the time.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Wish I could give it zero stars. First of all, it stopped loading. Tried it over ten times and the farthest it gets is the \\"Imangi\\" logo, then it freezes and kicks me out. Second of all, there are pop-ups to buy headstarts, for an insane 2,500 coins! It's very annoying, not to mention the fact that the dimensions are completely decieving. Colors blend into each other; one path on the right looks like its on the left. Another con is that you cannot change the device sensitivity I have to move my Kindle all the way on its side for the character to move a little to the right. Terrible. Too many ads even for a free game, greedy with the coins, and horrible controls. Take my advice and don't waste your time and money on this horrific sequel to Temple Run.<br /><br />EDIT: I have uninstalled Temple Run 2, and now I cannot reinstall it. Too many glitches. I'm sticking to the original Temple Run.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|This book is a classic. Interesting read and has so much more information that the movies. Great book for teenage girls who are interested how things &#34;used to be&#34;.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I loved this app the color is awesome and it's pretty accurate. It's very fun to mess around with it but be sure to just set off like 5 hours to calibrate it.
B007USWCXS|5.0|Ordering &#34;Le Havre&#34; was un plaiser! It arrived quickly and in good condition. I haven't played it yet, but I am sure it will function well.
B007TML4EI|4.0|This app was and excellent game that works fine even on slow tablets as my own (as long as I don't go to crazy). This app functions fine but on some levels the physics are a bit weird but I would totally suggest getting this app.
0062073192|5.0|This book was very good and made me feel as if the actual John Winchester wrote it not only does it teach you about the supernatural but it tells us the personal life of Winchester and sons. The book was very well written and I would recommend it to anyone interested in supernatural or who are just looking for a good book to read
1847027954|5.0|I bought this for my 84 yo mother and it's just a beautiful edition...The print is nice and large and very easy for her to read....She was thrilled and so was I....!!!!
B009HELT3C|5.0|We loved this movie.  The actor that plays Kay did an excellent job!  It had a great storyline, great special effects, great actors and of course was super funny.  I would highly recomment this movie.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Love the 3D aspect of this game. The bright colors & unusual symbols add to the difficulty.  Really like it.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  It had great special effects, lots of action, good acting and an interesting storyline.  Although it has basic similarities to the original movie, there are twists that keep you guessing.  Great movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I never thought the story of struggle for survival of a stranded astronaut could be so engaging, technically accurate and fun: I loved every bit of this book. This is hard SF at its best.
B00ARN0YDS|4.0|Good Movie. My teenage sons and I really enjoyed it and look forward to the next one. The way that it ended let us know there will be a #5.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This is Taylor Swift's best album yet!!  She has matured and you can hear it in her music and sound writing.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|The Ap works perfectly on my Kindle!!! A vast improvement over the normal on line Hotmail performance. I would highly recommend this Ap.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|One of my favorite bands ever.  I would recommend this CD.  Every song is great. Listen to it all the time.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I loved this movie. I had heard and read good reviews for it, so I was excited to see it. The movie may be a bit scary for kids under  7 or 8, but overall a great movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is great for horse lovers. it's great for kids too. it's easy, fun, and intriguing. I like it.
B008Q0B0I2|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  I watched it with a friend and she was very pleased as well.  Great movie.  s
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is probably the best show I've ever watched, very addicting and the price is not to bad either! Amazing!
0439023521|5.0|Great storyline.  The literature itself is a pretty easy read, however I would recommend this book to a friend.  s
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great app store'has all the poular apps and books u want  pleanty of them are free... Plus u can'tbeat the Amazon kinde ap :-)
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It is actually a lot more difficult than I antipated, so I really enjoy playing against the computer.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Good mail app easy to use and updated regularly no lags or complicated setup. U just download for free from the Amazon app store enter your info and your set up.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I got this as a gift for my older sister.  This is her favorite movie, and with the new edition, there are alternate endings she can choose from.  She was more than satisfied.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i like this but i would like it to be updated with wolves ocelots squids endermen and more ways to have fun!
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Glad to read a great book I missed until now (I'm 77).  So sad to wonder what she would have accomplished if she had lived....and how her rescue was so close.  She had great insight for a 13-15 year old!  I wonder if it's still required reading in school.  I hope so!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I don't have any sort of electronic or wifi piece of equipment and this was very exciting for me to be able to see my email in another room of my house.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a gifted writer!  Interest was kept at a very high level.  I ran through the book!  Marvelous ending, too.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Completely satisfied with this purchase.  I Had no complaints whatsoever.  Would definitely make a similar purchase in the near future.
0307592731|5.0|This was an incredible account of a most treacherous journey. I loved the style of writing and the personal connections made throughout the journey.
B004HD61KE|4.0|A very fast read. An interesting blend of science, and adventure. It was a little confusing to keep up with all of the characters.
B00ARAO720|3.0|Although the storyline was pretty good, I had a hard time following it in the beginning.  LOTS of wild bike-riding!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Although it has a bit of ups and downs, overall it goes smoothly, especially if you go back and play the whole season at once.<br /><br />It's a high class soap opera.  My grandmother could have been one of those daughters - she grew up in a large house in England and was the same age - so it helped me understand a lot about her, especially her comment that her family had lost all their money in WW1.<br /><br />Such a fascinating cast and such good understanding of the various personalities and the relationships and tensions  - personal and professional - between each individual.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who likes good believable acting with a good script
B002M9WW30|5.0|This set is awesome and perfect for any Rocky lover! The High Def is great and makes the movies seem all new because you notice things you never did before. Buy it now!!
B005TKD512|5.0|I can't help but wonder how much better our laws, our marketing campaigns, our public and private policies and our lives as a whole would be, if we all read and applied this book.<br /><br />Switch is a clever, inspiring, insights-packed, brilliantly explained user guide for human beings. It clearly outlines what the true cause for our behaviours is and then offers a step-by-step guide on how to change them.<br /><br />I would recomend this book to anyone who cares even he slightest bit about creating a better world, work environment, family or personal life. I guess that should be everyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is awesome.  it makes time go by fast it is fun if u have f friends that have this app cuz u can play with them
0385535147|4.0|It kept my interest throughout the book.  I even got to hate the main character a little .  I would recommend it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I Have found some fun and interesting ideas for my home, cooking, traveling, etc, really have enjoyed it so far.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I thought this movie would be a light comedy but it is more like a docu-drama about losing sexual desires for your partner as you age.  Acting was good and subject thought provoking.
1401322786|4.0|I write a letter each month to all 8 of my grandchildren,.  I always suggest a good book for them to read.  Since this was the subject of my January letter, It fell right into place.  I enjoyed the book very much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downtont Abbey is great...<br />Love the storyline and the characters. They capture the audience for me with the twists and turns of thei drama, love story and action...
0525952926|4.0|Haven't had time to start this book.  As soon as I complete the first &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; book I will enjoy a rainy day with this one.
B000ZHXUG4|5.0|Mortensen is one of my favorite actors.  This film is a bit on the darker side involving sex slaves.  The focus is on a diary the doctor finds after trying to save a pregnant girl and her baby. Trying to translate the diary gets her in deeper than is healthy.
1907360212|5.0|This will become a gift to my grand-daughter.  She loves to read and enjoys the classics.  Thanks for the beautiful gold trimmed pages.  She will love it.
B0060D15AK|5.0|Reynolds and Bullock are very good together.  He (Reynolds) hates his boss (Bullock) until he has time to get to know her better.  Throw Betty White in there and enjoy the laughs!
0525951652|4.0|Haven't finished this book, however it isn't as good as &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;.  I am interested in the trilogy as usually one novel needs a follow up on all the characters.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|A galore of talent in this movie.  I enjoyed it.  Light- hearted and funny.  The Barton Bella's sing and argue among themselves and the competition to make it to the finals. And become friends through the trial and errors.
1401223176|5.0|Jeph Loeb has become my favorite writer for Batman stories.<br />Both this brilliant piece and The Long Halloween have are among my favorite Batman Comics. The story is amazing and the art is beyond compare. Jim Lee is as good if not better than Tim Sale. Now all I need to do is buy Dark Victory and Haunted Knight.<br />Loeb deserves to be recognized as one of the best Batman writers of all time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it love it love it love it I love horses so much even thou this is not the real thing I still love it
1451695195|5.0|If you do not believe in heaven, or have some doubts . . . this is a must read.<br />A first-hand account of a peak into Heaven. A very warm and fuzzy read.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|It was just one of those movies where you didn't really end up with any feeling towards any of the characters which made it difficult to get into.
B0044WSF5M|5.0|This film never gets old -- the casting is spot on -- the music is nostalgic and wonderful -- brings back high school memories.
B009157BWU|5.0|It was so interesting and I loved the story-like narration with it.<br />I wish I knew more about how this was filmed.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Thank goodness Yahoo introduced this.  The Mail App on the Kindle Fire is horrible.  This loads quickly, updates automatically (well, set to Push), everything/all locations of my mail are synch'ed and up to date, and it's easy to navigate (folders, compose, contacts, etc.).  I'm very happy I downloaded this and never have to look back the Mail App again!
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Excellent product. Not too much that I can say. I decided not to go with the intel heatsink but the performance of the chip has been good.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I'm totally addicted to Angry Birds.  Love this new one and the new birds, angles, and features.  I did only purchase because in regular Angry Birds, they said there was a sale for 99 cents, however, I was charged $2.99.  No worries though, I would have bought it eventually.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|So far this is working great, and much better than the stock cooler for my i5 750 lga1156.  When I opened my HAF932 case, I was worried that the backplate would not fit because it sticks out a bit, but everything fit fine.  I had to unscrew my motherboard from the case even though my case has a cutout window which looks like its purpose is to allow attaching an aftermarket cooler without unscrewing the entire mobo.  Haven't recorded temps yet, but I overclocked the i5 to 3.8 GHz with no problems yet.  Installation was fairly straightforward, the printed instructions were fine for me, but I've heard there are some good Youtube videos that do a better job explaining.
0316228532|5.0|Harry was a hero, Hermione was a genius, but Ron was just an average teen, a bit clumsy and unlike his brothers and friends, possessed no extra ordinary talent.  It was opportunity that made Ron great.  He had the opportunity to shine (and to fail) because of the adventures and troubles his friends got him into.<br /><br />This novel is about the forgotten Ron Weasleys, the teens who we never gave an opportunity to shine, the children we ignored and dismissed.  Rowling isn't just writing an extraordinary novel, she's also sending a message.  She's trying to wake up this generation of adults and remind them that our children-not just biological children but all the children of our community-are our responsibility.  We can't ignore them, we can't be absent, they cannot become the casualty of our self absorption. The title The Casual Vacancy is not just about an open seat on the local city council, but about how we are casually vacant, absent when this growing generation of kids and teens need us to be present.  In this way, this book is very much a book from the creator of Harry Potter.  In the Potter books, Rowling tells children they can be amazing.  In this book, Rowling asks parents to step up, be present, and open up the opportunity for their children to be amazing.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a must have tool to maintain your knife. Keeps my knife on the ready and perfect size for easy storage and access.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This application is a lot of fun to play.  It is challenging, which I like.  The easy puzzles give you the flavor of the game, and the hard definitely challenge.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Lovely graphics;nice environment; brand new obsticals. I rate it a ten out of ten. I am hooked on it. like I said; lovely. oh; sorry; gotta go play temple run 2!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It's not what you think it is.  Even while you're reading it, you think it's one thing, but it's not.<br />The story takes place in recent-history Ireland, and goes back a few decades.  I enjoyed reading about rural, hard-scrabble Ireland, and the friends who make a difficult man's life manageable.  I also enjoyed reading about the duty-bound adult daughter who finds her new freedom more challenging than she anticipated.  These parts contain some excellent comedy scenes and lines.  The parts that are hard to read are about the inhumane conditions of Irish orphanages.  Some people might<br />find these sections upsetting. Because they are set in the context of how life gets better, they are readable.  Nothing too<br />graphic, but grim.  The author was brilliant to set such an awful personal history in the midst of comedic present.  All ends well.<br />Very good novel about how the past shapes us, and how new relationships can shape us anew.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I can notice the change immediately, the gain is excellent now I can enjoy music more, just becarefull cause its amplifies the sound so it can damage your ears!
B008QE9XD2|3.0|It was an okay movie, but I don't know that I would take the time to watch it again. Love Depp, but this was just not up to par. Seller provided the product on time and in great condition.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Wow! This was a dark and suspenseful book.  The twists and turns were nonstop, right to the end. I say Wow again!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|We all really enjoyed this movie. My daughter thought it was silly and we thought it was hilarious! There's a lot of adult humor in it. Great addition to the Christmas movie collection.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Spark's typical romance, except it deals with a woman on the run from her abusive husband. He does a good job of capturing the thoughts of the abuser as well as the abused.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|UNKNOWN<br /><br />VERY GOOD MOVIE, LOTS OF ACTION AND INTRIGUE. USUALLY CAN FIGURER OUT WHOS THE BAD GUY, BUT NOT WITH THIS ONE. KEPT ME VERY INTERESTED
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season is packed full of great twists and new cast members. I'm hooked, and I just started season 1 earlier this year ;)
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, almost all of the characters in this movie are captivating. After watching the trailers I thought I was going to be rooting for Bruce Willis' character but I found myself feeling a little lost as to who I was rooting for.<br /><br />In the end I found myself learning about the cycle (or &#34;loop&#34;) people who go through hard times face and how one person's selfless actions can close it for the better, leading to a much brighter future.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I loved Ms. Demick's review of ordinary and privledged citizens of North Korea. I was astounished to learn that there were North Koreans who had special Japanese privledges. Interesting! And that most doctors were fed worse than most dogs in China. Overall, this book is a must read!
1401941893|4.0|Love this book! I bought this book for my daughter who is 15 years old..she told me she loved  it and that i should read it i did and i agreed is a really nice book!!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I first learned of Shin Dong-hyuk's story on 60 minutes and was fascinated by his plight to arrive in North Korea and then America. It is a must read for anyone interested in North Korean politics and social.
0765325950|5.0|I started reading Robert Jordan in middle school and have waited a LONG time for this book.  I will state that Brandon Sanderson is NOT the author that Robert Jordan was and I believe that this could have been a much better book had things turned out differently.  I absolutely enjoyed this book though.  It was a nice ending to an awesome series and I will be re-reading the entire series multiple more times in my life.  The series overall is my favorite series of all time.  You can find characters to relate to no matter your walk of life.  Not your typical fantasy novel with all sorts of fantastical themes, but more myth and belief-based fictional writing.  You've got to love that Robert Jordan brought multiple beliefs/perspectives/genres into this series fleshing it out into a series that has changed my life.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|the first tme i treid to download this game it did not work so i am trying a gain in hopes it will worm this time but i have hi expectations for it
B006LSZECO|4.0|This story is told by 2 people - the husband as the narrator and the wife - starts out with her diary writing and then at the end she also has her own narrative.  This type of narrating was something I did not prefer as the book started - however, the opinion and feeling of both characters is critical to make this story intense.<br /><br />As I read the story, my like or dislike for each character changed to many times, which is something I have not felt in a story before.  In the end, I think the husband prevailed - but definitely not innocent.<br /><br />The twist and turns in this book are good. I think the first 50% of the book is slower - however, it is setting the scene for the 2nd half.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book - but I would say it was a favorite of mine.  Worth the read if you like a little suspense and mystery without any blood or grotesque details.
8866130915|5.0|been using this style planner for 8 or so years. Like its flexibility, note-keeping space etc.  perfect for my lifestyle.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I am a fan of the Fifty Shade series - I truly enjoyed book 1 and 2 as they were a fun and entertaining read with new sex scenes and suspense with where the relationship was going.<br /><br />Book 3 was almost impossible for me to finish as their relationship became too predictable.  He wants control.  She does not like it.  They argue as each of them tries to convince the other change their behavior - in the end they have sex to make up because they are addicted to each other which is so unhealthy.<br /><br />The only highlights to this book was the suspense added as someone was trying to kill them.  It added a little excitement - but not consistent enough.<br /><br />If you enjoyed book 1 and 2 and are not sure if you want to read another - I would say don't.  But this is just my opinion.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|We are anxiously awaiting his next CD.  This CD is exactly what we would have expected from him! Wonderfujl music as only Phillip Phillips can sing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was an interesting read with an unpredictable ending.  I  would only recommend it to people who would not be shocked by the sexual content.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun and super addicting. I enjoy it more then the first one. Recommended if you liked the first and runs great on Kindle Fire!
B005IQZB14|4.0|It was a fascinating documentary.  I would recommend this book highly to anyone.  The hardships she endured were  hard to fathom.<br /><br />Wild
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|The first album with the new sound for LP. This album is one of the best for Linkin Park. The mix of electonics and the band blend nicely with the lyrics. Simply the best!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is the type of game that never appears anywhere but on wii, and even those are hard to understand and even harder to control! To put in short, I've been searching for this sort of app. (So has Rin!!!)
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's first album is by far the best. Every song on here could have been a single if wanted too. The album will stick with you for the rest of your life.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This item makes it so much easier to plug in my Kindle to be recharged, I can basicaly charge it anywhere in my home, and as I have a bad back and bending over is not a good option, this cable makes it easier for me to use.
B000069CWE|3.0|This album is good for its mix. The different artists having there mix on the origanal LP Hybrid Thorey. I do believe they could have done better but starting out they did great.
B003G4W49C|5.0|WOW, this is an exciting story and has inspired me to be a better leader in my job!  I look forward to reading more from Card.
B0042YT8WG|4.0|I love LP and this cd is really great, their new sound is great and the lyrics get you pumped up like the older songs.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|While I believe that the transformation of Norton's character was a bit shallow,I still give this movie 5 stars for portraying the reality in America, his speeches were amazing and it really makes you think about the way a lot of people think. His speeches are so powerful that he makes you think he IS right. I highly recommend this movie. It is pretty good.
B00008H2LB|4.0|For Linkin Parks 3rd album (2nd not counting the remix) this album is great like the first one. New theme makes the music videos and the music itself awesome to listen too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it, it's fun and the graphics are very realistic, there are plenty of things to do and activities activities for the horse, no complaints here !!
B000OCXMAE|4.0|First of LP (Linkin Park)'s albums with there new style of music. They have a new sound that stick with you like their older albums. Their controversal lyrics make them a great talk, and makes this a great album.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved this book because some people can relate to what some characters in the boo went through so I thought it was a wonderful book
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because it is just so much fun to play.  I enjoy the fact that this one has more variety in game play, making it feel more like a PC game.  This game utilizes the 'tilt' capabilities far more than the first Temple Run.  Only negative for me so far is that the 'scenery' he runs through changes so fast that my older eyes and poorer hand/eye coordination sometimes can't keep up.  Younger folks probably won't have these problems.  Also, my 23 year old, who can't read in a moving car without getting headaches, says that Temple Run 2 gives her the same motion sickness and headache as if she were trying to read in the car.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love it, really thought it was a great book. I also, really enjoyed the ending, and how it all played out.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|is anyone else not able to open temple run 2? it work for 1 day after downloading it and now it will go to the screen with green on it then go to my main screen on my kindle?
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is definitely one of the best books that I have read. Could not put it down. I cant wait to finish the next one. Anyone that hasn't read this series is definitely missing out!
B00AOOIIVA|4.0|Being a mother of two boys, 7 and 9, I watch a lot of children movies. Being a Tim Burton movie, I expected it to be a little dark and I was not disappointed. It was a little on the sad side but the characters were charming.....
B003XRELGQ|5.0|The funniest book about the end of the world that I have read. Biting sarcasm, sharp cynicism, and ignorant apathy combine with fantastic science fiction o create a very palatable and digestive brew.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|As soon as I started reading this book I knew it was going to be a great one. It's crazy how the simplest details throughoutthe story together towards the end so well. I loved all the characters and the way the author made them seem so real. Definitely a great read!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|great love story. Author repeats her self so much it's quite annoying. i love the story between Christian and Ana. The sex is interesting just because its different. it gets old and i start skimming through it though. I would recommend reading it though
B004VMUS9G|5.0|If you're looking for an alarm clock, this is the best app.The setting are easily customizable and the look is simple and sleek.
B006X8GFBQ|5.0|Reynolds is known for a sequence of good space opera.  This is a different history from those but it looks to me that there will be a sequel.  Some good solutions here, well handled but there are plenty of others hinted at!
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Not hilarious. A few very funny scenes, but not the great comedy I was told it would be. I don't why this was such a huge hit in theaters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Tis an amazing game. IMANGI really outdid themselves. Beware. Act fast, or youll be falling off a cliff, or be toasted to cinders.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this across all of my devices and even via the web at my work.  I can mail to and from, save quick notes on my phone, and I even type my sermon notes for use on my Kindle and save the trouble of flipping through pages.  this little program has saved me more time an effort than I can count.  I am sure it would do more but it is doing so much for me now that I really don't think I could handle it.  I have read about some calendar feature, but for now my work uses Outlook so I am stuck.  this program would be worth it for $30 or more for the amount if productivity.  I am sure there is some advertising angle but I haven't noticed so it is discreet.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|The writing is right on with the story line...so touching...scary this stuff keeps happening in our world...sad reality...want to read more from her....
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I choose the 5 stars because this book is just amazing.  In the begging I was hooked.  It brought back memories of myself growing up and what I have become today.  This book is a must read by ANY Nicholas Spark fan!!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game!!!  My friends and I play it all the time.  I can't draw very well but they somehow are able to guess. It correctly lol
B009UX2YAC|5.0|probably the most enjoyabble game yet the kids love it and i love it i am so pleased with subway surfer thanks so much
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is very fun I love the railroad tracks,and the gient munckey so cool love it . Must have game LOLZ.
B005HSL626|5.0|everyone knows how great this one is there is not much more to write about the most popular game in the world
B007EDYN36|3.0|I was disappointed in this book.  Having been a long time Kiss fan, and being especially fond of Peter, I was disappointed to see so much of the book focused on his bitterness towards Gene and Paul.  Seriously, regardless of how badly he may have been treated, he led a life most only dream of and did not share enough of that.  And I would have rather read more about the music, and the tours, and his life.  While still entertaining, it could have been better, Peter could have done a better job.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It brings back memories playing this game.  Great graphics.  Addictive.  Could play for hours.  Great way to relax after a hard day.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I bought my daughter a low cost Android tablet over Christmas and this was one of the applications that I purchased for it. She loves it. I just loaded it on there, and did not even know how much she has been using it until about a month later she showed me all of the pictures that she created with it. My son likes it too.<br /><br />Great product!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book deals with very sensitive subject matter, which certainly gives you food for thought. However, Jojo Moyes brings a lot of humour into the story and you really feel a bond with the different characters. I rate this as one of the best books I have ever read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The first temple run was fun. But then it was kinda the same thing over and over again. This is so much better and NEVER gets boring. They added in things like a zipline, and a minecart. A HUGE monkey thing is chasing you instead of a pack or whatever. Its rated 4 stars, but I give it a 5.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I cannot possibly do justice to this book except to recommend it highly as a  hilarious, quirky, and refreshing change to whatever reading diet you're on. The characters are delightful, and in the reminiscences of the 100-year-old protagonist, the reader is taken on a romp through world history that is informative as well as entertaining.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|WARNING:Highly addictive Fun for Hours LOVE this game  hope to see more temple run games in the future.  #LOVE IT
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Excellent movie for all ages. Humorous but educational for the kids and adults.  Good viewing for everyone, with a happy ending.
B000CZ0Q5W|4.0|Very hard to categorize this album ... which is a big part of the appeal. Is it Jazz? Or New Age? Or World Music? To my ears it's a mixture of all these genres, plus some other unspecified ingredient that ties all the loose ends together and it makes it flow. Or rather Metheny allows all those loose ends to unravel further, creating a whole different sort of musical tapestry, one that never stays in one piece, but that makes a strong impression. Whatever you want to label this music, it's beautiful and after repeated listenings it really sticks in your head, and in your soul. Above all, this music SOARS. Metheny's distinctive guitar playing, the vibrant rhythm section, and the swelling chorus of voices, all blending and rising ... and soaring. Truly, this music will take you to a higher plane. I'm not a mystical or new age type of person, but this music is a different creature altogether.
B00181JGI2|5.0|To me, this is one of the funniest movies I have ever sen, and just seems to get funnier and funnier with repeated viewings. John Goodman was robbed of an Oscar nomination for this.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I will admit, when it came out I wasnt expecting much from it. But after watching it with my family, I love this movie. Funny, and whitty to the end. I recommend it for everyone.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|i think the 50 shades darker is better but, i did how the story gave Christians point of view when he first encountered her
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Ill admit, its a good movie, pretty funny, and Mila Kunis.. Common thats the main reason a lot of guys watch this movie. She is amazing, but its a funny movie.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|the book was a good read!  it was a cheap read so .....really u cannot beat the fact that it was cheap and good.  If would recommend this title
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I love this movie. So much action, and it constantly keeps you guessing on whats going to happen next. It has a lot of twist and turns, and with its high action I highly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|out of all three books I love this one the most!  this book i will probably re-read at a later date.  the storyline is awesome
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I would recommend this calculator because it is easy to use.  Simple and does the job.<br />The numbers are large enough to see easily.<br />IT has just the basic functions.<br />Another good feature is that it will show the history of your calculations.<br />And finally, it is FREE
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was really really good!!!'<br />I was super impressed. My mom and I wanted to see the movie when it comes out so we both bought the book and read it. I hope the movie is as good,but the movie is never as good as the book and this book is very high standard.
0525953590|5.0|An excellent book: heavily focused on concepts but little math.  The book is ultimately about the Higgs Boson, but to understand why it is important you need to understand the background leading up to the search for it.  The lack of math certainly makes it not a rigorous treatment of the subject, but you will come away with a conceptual understanding of progress made in particle physics over the last 30 years.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it like it's my own horse<br />And feeding it is pretty realistic . And<br /> the grooming is fun
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm in love with this game, but it's really laggy any glicthy. Please patch the glicthes and lags. I did 2 objections (the &quot;use a head start&quot; and &quot;use to save me's&quot;) and it lagged me out when I tried to use the second save me and I lost all the emeralds and coins I spent + it didn't count!!!!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I chose this rating because the book is Interesting. It held my attention and was very hard to put down. This book was recommended to me by my Granddaughter. It is the kind of book I would recommend to young ladies. I am not a young lady but I enjoy reading different kinds of novels & this one was Great! Have now started reading the sequel to this one and am already glad that I am.
0141195851|5.0|There are scenes that lift readers to a heavenly perch, from which to watch ourselves and our ways, by which to compare, say our ideals with our actions.  These same passages are transcendent in other ways:  timeless, beautiful, evidence of Dickens' tremendous imagination and ability to depict the human condition.<br /><br />This Penguin series seems sturdy enough to withstand many readings; the paper is heavy and easy to turn; and there's just enough margin that I can make a few notes.  Light enough to backpack a couple titles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a awesome game it is even better then the first one I wish this can go on my phone but it can't
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think it is really fun but I don't think some of he games are realistic and weird but the game is fun
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Nice quality leather with smooth cloth on the inside of the case with different viewing angles to hold your kindle, definitely worth the money.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|Stopped working, I have no reason why, tried reinstall. Think some other program may be interfering with it.<br />It was nice while it lasted.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This is an awesome product. It works exactly as advertised. I get multiple full charges on my EVO 3D and GSIII. Especially useful for peace of mind when traveling, I don't have to worry about my phone running out of juice.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|What a great and fun movie for the whole family.  My husband even enjoyed this one - the commentators and hysterical in the movie. The music is fantastic!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As a dog lover and a racing fan this book caught my attention from both angles.  The story was gentle and kept me engaged through the entire book.  I've suggested it to several people already. You'll be invested in the characters from page one.  Especially the canine philosopher.
B00AH69MS8|5.0|This is Metallica's best album. I bought it because my old ones had worn out or were stolen by freinds and family. If you don't have it already, what are you waiting for?
B003XF1OJK|5.0|It so far is still my favorite book out of the entire collection. The action is well written, the personal issues, the ethical issues, moral complexes, extremely enjoyable.
B009KUANWG|5.0|This is actually the first Adele song I've liked enough to buy. It got me interested in the rest of her music, and I recommend it highly, even to people who are not fans of Adele.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|when I first got it it was fun at first then it started getting s l o w and I could barely do it!I think temple run is a lot better.I give it 2 stars.
B006XOBFB0|5.0|Mozart is where I turn to be sure the sun is coming up tomorrow and M.P. delivers the sunny dignity inherent in almost all Mozart. He gives each note its due share of the time and sound. He does not go mechanical as can become a trap with Mozart. This goes in my section of Mozart to be heard repeatedly along with M. Uchida, M. Kirschnereit,and Ingrid Haebler. Only one disappointment-disc #1 was flat and uninteresting though given the liveliness of the rest I need a revisit and I look forward to it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I just luv it.so much fun;I had to buy it.my son got it on his kindle and is now playing it all the time.
B003XQG0JI|4.0|An excellent CD featuring Sharon Corr and her music.  Since The Corrs are not performing as a group at this time, Corrs fans will enjoy hearing Sharon.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A small gift to myself over Christmtas, this book was advertised on my Kindle.  Easy read with a fun plot twist--great for a weekend read!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|This is one of those crazy &#34;action&#34; films with practically non-stop fighting, shooting, chase scenes and some explosions to really spice things up.  And it's a has sci-fi gritty future world backdrop and the amnesiac hero vs the evil government and robots, the good girl and the bad girl, both beautiful, and the mind twist and double twist thing.... A lot of stuff packed into one vehicle!  You've seen the elements in other movies, Blade Runner, some of Hitchcock's spy or innocent man being chased and chasing after the McGuffin, other &#34;I don't know who I am or why they're chasing me but I know I am right and I will triumph by the end of this movie...&#34; movies.  This one has it all and a good mix.  Spectacular sets and scenery, with lots of fine detail for the HD camera and screen.<br /><br />Totally unbelievable, BUT, if you can suspend disbelief for just a moment and let the movie sweep you into its world, it will keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the last scene!  ****
0553386794|5.0|\\"Game of Names.\\" This is my nickname for the first book out of George R.R. Martin's first book of his \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series. Yes, it is wordy. Yes, it's confusing, and, at times, provocative, unpredictable, or pointless, but wholesomely worth the first few hundred pages of back ground and court-talk.<br /><br />In the first book of the \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series, we spend much of our time focuses on the Stark family of Winterfell. Content with their cozy life at home in the frigid north, the Winterfell family, including their fearless and wise leader, Lord Eddard Stark, never anticipates the events that are beginning to take place. The first of the unnatural events that takes place includes Lord Eddard's sons finding the pups of a long-feared and rare breed of wolves, called dire wolves. There is one wolf for each child, including Eddard's bastard son, John. The wolves provide strange, yet, welcome companions for the children of Eddard. Suspiciously, King Robert visits with little warning after the death of the last Hand of the King, Jon Arryn. Things quickly fall into place as Robert offers Eddard the new position as Hand of the King, meaning he must uproot himself to move down south and serve the king by handling his matters, and bring his two daughters to learn the ways of the court. One of Eddard's younger sons is tragically injured and in a coma shortly before Eddard's departure, and Eddard's bastard son is forced to go serve on the wall up north to protect the realm from the ancient dangers from beyond the wall. Eddard's oldest son is forced to take up position as the Lord of Winterfell in his father's absence, and his mother, Catelyn, must act as his adviser during her grief of parting with her husband and daughters. Before the Starks really have a grip on their new lives, evil is stirring on the wall, the Starks are in serious danger down south, and the Starks in Winterfell are facing life-changing challenges.  Another family featured in the novel is the Targaryen family, who includes Prince Viserys and Princess Daenerys, the remnants of the family ruling the kingdom before King Robert overthrew their power and claimed their throne.<br /><br />This book is above and beyond one of the most enthralling books to read and is easy to get lost in. After you get over the initially hiccups of trying to decipher who is who and how they relate to one and other, you won't be able to stop reading! Although this book is geared towards adults because of some of the language and sexual scenes or innuendos, there is theoretically a character in this book that can relate to anyone and everyone. After contemplating it for several hours, I've determined that there is not real way to maintain the clever story-telling and introduction of characters without introducing plenty of names at once. Half of the fun of reading the book is to try and piece together who is who and how they relate to all of the other characters.<br /><br />This book is sure to be a winner for those lovers of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Eragon.\\" Much like these two series, \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" books creates its own universe, complete with its own languages, species, religions, and histories spanning back thousands of years.ovel is the Targaryen family, who includes Prince Viserys and Princess Daenerys, the remnants of the family ruling the kingdom before King Robert overthrew their power and claimed their throne.<br /><br />This book is above and beyond one of the most enthralling books to read and is easy to get lost in.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|SO inspiring and engrossing.  I would hope that the author's pther work is as good.  Glad to see a movie is out and has so many nominations -- if the movie is true to the book, it HAS to be a classic
1620402963|4.0|Interesting book that reads pleasantly. The book could have done with only one main character (the mother) rather tha adding another one (the daughter). Probably the second one was added to bring a message across: \\"we think to know people but how much do we really know about others?\\"<br />So a great story of the mother but the second character that doesn't contribute to the book.<br />Still a pleasant read that doesn't take long to finish.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|With the whole gang back, this is just another wild trip.  Funny and exciting! Great to see alone or with your family over and over again (maybe not as many as Finding Nemo, but close!!)
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I first heard about this TV show when it came out in 2010. I wasn't interested. But in late 2012, I was bored with the TV shows that were on, so I decided to buy the first season of this. WOW. I was surprised that it was such an amazing TV show, despite all of the good reviews. This is a must-see for anyone who likes the horror genre.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was my 9 year old son's favorite Christmas gift. It shipped quickly and was the cheapest I have found!
B002ZBRSIY|4.0|Something to watch on a lazy evening. Switch off your brains, get a nice, refreshing drink, a bunch of friends and watch. Even if you miss a bit in between it does not matter, its all entertainment, mixed up plot-lines, so set it up on a nice bog screen and enjoy.<br /><br />Definitely not intellectual.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|if you enjoyed previous albums by Il Divo, this one will blow you away.<br />they just keep getting better . I would recommend this. There is not one song<br />i do not like. Have the album on my MP3 and it is just pure pleasure to listen to.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|Fun movie, my 10 year old liked this one too.  Like a live version of Wall-E. For some reason it displayed in 4:3 even though it said widescreen version though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and it is coming out in a movie in feb 2013!!! Should be a good movie if they stay with the book and dont edit too much. definately worth reading.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Two years ago I bought the entire Outlander series and read all of them. Loved every page! This year I picked up the first book and just browsed a few pages and realized that I read the whole series so fast that I missed a lot of history and really good writing. Jamie and Claire will keep you breathless either from their action packed adventures or their tender love story. So, now I am loading them all on my kindle and the books are just as exciting as the first time! This is the first time I have ever re-read a book. So, the Outlander series is just as exciting the second time around. Thanks for letting me review!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|well the game has lag just like the first one did...its fun when it works and isn't force closing every time I try opening the game. other than all that's its an ok game for free.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|My grandson loves Legos and this package was no exception.  It was fun and entertaining and had just the right amount of difficulty to challange him.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My girls loved this movie and have watched it over 4 times.  Would reccomend this movie for girls age 10-15
0307959856|3.0|The night before the Lady Anne ball there is a murder on the Woodlands of Pemberley estate. Elizabeth and Darcy  are having a family dinner when the are informed of the murder, and Darcy,the Colonial and the lawyer form a search party. They are surprised to find Darcy's brother-in-law leaning over the body. This is a great storyline and the characters are well developed. P.D. James has done it again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this.  I really like they way they captured the changing of leads.  Plays great on the iPad, but tends to lag a bit on the kindle fire hd
B007704HO6|3.0|Not a well written book but came straight from his heart which kept me turning the pages....i loved that the book kept these 2 damaged creatures, man and cat, alive and kicking
B00447G2PM|5.0|Hell no! I have a Samsung led lcd 55&#34; @ 9' distance and the 3D effects from this IMAX title will blow your visual mind. It's that good.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Loved this book, easy reading, lots of giggles and well written. This book was Just what i needed to lift my spirit
B009X01D9U|5.0|love it! it rotates, has a strap to keep it closed, and even has a place to slide your hand into when you flip it open!
B007ADIRDM|4.0|I guess you have to have a kid crazy about Monster High dolls and accessories like mine:) The price was all right because these things get very spendy...She was very happy to get it with the high school set and it is all that mattered...she was crazy happy actually and it came on time, so...Christmas day!! was really amazed
B00479SVBU|2.0|I purchased the higher range of this item ($54) thinking the navigation of the contents will be easier. But I was wrong. There is no tree structured navigation it will provide. All the folders in the memory will be displayed as one long single list and you have to touch all the folders in between to jump to another folder in the list. Some of the mp3 files are not played properly (with distorted sound), not sure if it is a problem with the device or the file.
B006JRIZJG|4.0|Bought this for.5 y.o. to store about 8 barbies and some accessories....will  hold.alot more though.  Its a.soft, vinyl-like material so its not sturdy, but i think its durable enough.  Plus,.my daughter likes to use it as a background/stage.  Basically it does exactly.what i needed...it encourages her to keep her barbies together and take care of.them, at a.good price and its not bulky
1593157134|4.0|I ordered this for one of my friend and he is happy with the book. I don't have a reason to give it less than 4 star.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Dr. Seuss is brilliant.  This movie is an excellent way to teach kids about conserving and being kind to our planet.  I've also used it as a teaching tool by telling my daughter her behavior is Lorax approved or not.  Recycling...Lorax approved, pulling all the toilet paper off the roll...NOT Lorax approved.
B000FC10WU|5.0|Agatha Christie - 'nuff said!  My favorite author of all time.  When you pick up one of her books you don't want to put it down till its finished.  The characters are well defined and the plots are diabolical.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|What a great message, especially if you have daughters.  My husband can't stand the traditional Prince rescues the helpless Princess and they live happily ever after, so this is a great new age &#34;Princess&#34; movie.  The music is also wonderful.  The bear scenes might be a little scary for some kids.  We first watched it in our towns only movie theater (a drive in) and what an impression it left with our daughter.  I am so glad we now own this movie.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought this case for my wife and I can tell the difference ... I have a REAL one ... What a rip off... I will be filing a complaint ...
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Love Steve Carell and the characters in this movie.  It has a very touching story line and one the whole family can enjoy.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this game and play  it often.  The cards are good sized and it is uncomplicated to play.  Great
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I LOVED this book.  It's funny, heartbreaking and utterly thought provoking.  Rarely do I want to see a book I love made into a movie, but this is an exception.  I almost need to see these characters embodied beyond just my imagination - I need to hear their banter and see their expressions.  One of the most exquisite reads I've had in a while.
0525953728|5.0|I purchased this book for my husband, after it was referred to me by a co-worker.  My husband is a Navy Veteran, who completed some SEAL training, so this was an exciting book for him to read.  He really enjoyed the ending, too.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Love it, feels good so far no problems with it. recommend this to anyone that is planning to get Monster Hunter 3DS, you are going to need this to play really good!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|wow after three days of playing it broke on me. I'm using the kindle fire and it keeps going back to the kindle menu right after I log into amazon games so I uninstalled it and it still doesn't work wtf
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome game so fun better than any game ever better than the first one so good I cant stop playing I am ranked in the 1% I am amazing
B00969PR18|5.0|I like maps because it helps me get places. and one day I was lost so I tik the map and it helped me get to the I was trying to get to
B00AA7O22U|3.0|From the acting to the effects to the one-liners, if you are in the mood for fun and one-liner groaners and lots of action and muscle, this movie is for you. We watched this with a bunch of guys, and what made it fun was making fun of the plot and dialogue and guessing 'is that guy still alive?' and 'can he have muscles like that at his age' and 'did he really just say that'?
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|What were Whalberg and Mila Kunis thinking? I hope they got paid well!!<br />Even the sappy ending could not savr this movie!
6305754969|5.0|I wont rate these any more if you try to force a minimum amount of words. I don't have time.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Colin Farrell is Okay!! and the little twists in the movie were good. Overall and as alaways the original was way better!!!
B001LRJH0K|5.0|.. I wont rate these any more if you try to force a minimum amount of words. I don't have the time.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Salma and a good cast save this movie. But when you come down to it. Its been done before to many times!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun :) I love horses, so this is an epic game. It gives you easy ways to earn gems, forexample, writing a review.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cable connected very well to the adaptor and kindle. Love the smooth material that is easy to unravel and wound-up again.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I did not think I would be able to sit through a movie with a talking teddy bear but this was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Love this movie, and I got a great deal on the two disc option over Cyber Monday, the quality is great in the Blu-ray
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Movie is good for Streep and Jones fans but is not really that great. About a couple who doesn't have sex anymore - that's about it
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|overall this is a great program.<br />It works exactly has expected.<br />it makes it easy to stream content from my phone to my ps3
B006RUJST6|5.0|I was enthralled with every twist and turn of this book.  It's a modern day love story.  Hoover made me believe in the characters.  Highly recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the bomb. There is no way they could make it any better. I told all my friends at school to get it. I hope the temple run makers keep up the good work and I'm sure future temple run 3 will be even better. Please get this game if you are wanting it!!!
1451695195|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  So much of the world today is scientific and if there is no explaination for it...then you are crazy,  This book brings the reader back to that familiar place (our home) and the sense of what we are missing here.  It is a very powerful explanation of a near death experience and what awaits us outside of our human shell. Thanks Eban! Great Book! I would highly recommend it!  Sincerely, Joyce
0375850864|2.0|This book was hard for me to keep reading. Half way through it was easier. My 12 year old son had to read it for a book club and enjoyed the book. After dissecting it with sparknotes - I can see that it is a well thought out - for younger readers. Just not my cup of tea.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This movie does not live up to its hype--at least not for me.  The biggest mistake made by the writers was to try to make this both a feel-good-touching-heartfelt movie and a comedy.  The reality is that \\"Ted\\" fails at being both.<br /><br />For a comedy, this movie made me laugh very few times; the few attempts at comedy were either random anti-Semitic comments, obscure sexual innuendo, or juvenile humor more appropriate for an audience of 14 year olds.  I wish MacFarlane would learn that excessive foul-language does not make any of the dialogue any funnier.  I do not really have a problem with explicit language, but when it is used excessively it contributes NOTHING to the movie in terms of comedy, nor does it contribute to the development of the characters or the plot.<br /><br />As a \\"heartwarming\\" movie, the biggest problem is that the two main characters--Ted and John--are not sympathetic.  When John's girlfriend left him, I did not feel sorry for him.  Instead, I wondered why she had not left him sooner.  Plus, the comedy in this movie was built around vulgarity and offensive humor, which is fine, except that it does not exactly provide a good backdrop for \\"heartwarming\\" or \\"feel-good\\" moments.<br /><br />Most people will probably watch this movie, regardless of anything they read in reviews--good or bad.  My two main problems with this movie are as follows:<br /><br />1.)  I wanted to watch a good comedy movie, and I only laughed about 3 times while watching this movie.<br />2.)  I was expecting to at least be able to reference scenes in this movie to other people, yet the movie itself is not very memorable.  I can't think of any truly memorable quotes from this movie, nor can I recall any scenes from the movie that I would talk about to other people.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Life changing book, a must read, i loved it! Dr. Alexander is a remarkable man and I found his story remarkable.
B004H83IM8|5.0|These movies are classics, you can't go wrong if you love goofy humor and endless cameos from other actors. A must-have in my opinion.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|We are huge Jason Bourne fans in my house and when this new one came out with Jeremy Renner we are excited to say it was great. This movie wraps in all three previous movies and leaves you wondering will there be more.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|The app doesn't load on my kindle fire HD. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still says \\"can not load\\" uninstalled until a solution is obtained.
B005LAII3A|3.0|Before I bought this movie I had already seen it on the big screen.  Even though its not a fantastic movie, I like the remake with the similarities to the first and some of things they changed.  In an action movie, I think Colin Farrell was great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|As a college kid i can honestly say this game is challenging and relaxing :) also it is good for younger kids too. I love it!
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|Off the wall fun movie. Good for a laugh and to just chill out from a stressful day of work.
B005VGMYZM|5.0|Another great recording and addition to my collection. I am still colllecting Andre Rieu recordings and hopew to get many more..
B009YU62H2|4.0|The first few play throughs I really enjoyed the first half of the album and I thought the second half was ok. Now after listening to it more the whole album has grown on me. It's a solid first album back after being apart for so long. Some of the songs sound a bit like Audioslave but that could just be Cornell's vocals (and not necessarily a bad thing either). I think fans of Soundgarden and/or Audioslave will enjoy King Animal.
B009IQG5LK|5.0|we were thrilled to see this movie available on blue ray!  it is one of our favorites and we thoroughly enjoy it...great cast of actors and interesting story line.  i would recommend this movie to anyone!  the quality is great.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|This album is a little bit more mellow than some of their earlier albums but it still sounds great. Not too many bands have an entire collection of albums that are all great but Deftones pulls it off. If you've only ever just heard the single Tempest, it's actually a great indication of how the rest of the album sounds. I don't think there is a bad song on the album and I've listened to it a lot in the last few weeks. Deftone fans should just go ahead and pick this up.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|In spite of a little self-justification this book is well written and downright riveting at times. The &#34;another day on the job&#34; attitude of the SEAL's is fascinating to a non-military person like myself.<br /><br />Better writing than a lot of war autobiographies, I enjoyed this book a lot and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the efforts of the guys who found Osama Bin Laden..
B0046MOVD0|4.0|The concept and locations in Afterlife are pretty cool. If you haven't seen the movie they are running around an Umbrella facility that is built to duplicate different cities for training. So you'll see Moscow, Tokyo and a suburan American town etc. I enjoyed the last movie but it and this movie have a similar flaw, there isn't much character development. We are introduced to three new characters, who also happen to be in the games including fan favorite Leon Kennedy, but we never really find anything out about them. The action is great as usual but the depth of character seems to be missing. Also the movies are starting to feel more like episodes than whole movies. This could end up being a good thing if there is an overall arc planned that pays off in the sixth movie or beyond. Otherwise it's a bit of a let down but still enjoyable if you've watched and enjoyed the previous 4 films.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Glad I read Safe Haven before I saw the movie.  Will be interested to see how different it will be.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|Clearly just trying to capitalize on the popularity of some certain &#34;With Friends&#34; games out there.  But this one is just like any other Yatzee game out there, nothing special about it and it's obvious they don't have the financial backing of those &#34;With Friends&#34; games.<br />Clicking on the notification bar for the game my tab (Nexus 7) freezes for about 3 seconds, then brings you to the game.  The N7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, so I'm quite sure it's not the tab just being slow.  Also, I keep getting notifications that &#34;your opponent has sent you a message.&#34;  But when i click the tiny little &#34;chat bubble&#34; icon, there's nothing there.<br />Also, no landscape mode for the tablet.  May just be personal preference, but I like the tab in landscape and would like the option to play in landscape.  I usually have the tab mounted, and to play the game I either have to unmount it or turn my head sideways to play.<br />The whole screen also doesn't fit so you have to scroll to see the whole scoreboard, on a 7&#34; tab they can't make it fit?<br />I'd uninstall right away if my girlfriend didn't like playing it so much!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Purchased 2 for my nieces for Christmas. They love it! It was awesome to see the look on their faces!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I think they wanted this game to be the new &#34;it&#34; game out there, but they overcomplicated things.  Gameplay is akin to Bejeweled or Candy Crush, just a lot fancier.  It includes a story of some kind, good graphics, easy gameplay, but it seems like whatever story they're trying to tell with the game is a little lost.<br />If you get it for free it's worth it to waste a couple minutes out of the day, but I haven't found myself &#34;addicted&#34; to it like I have with Candy Crush or Bejeweled on iPod.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|Love this game for your brain. It is easy to use, but challenging to your mind. It definately gives your brain a workout.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Been trying to use this for a while on my documents on my Nexus 7 with Bluetooth keyboard and I've had a lot of force-closes, cursor jumping around, crashing, excessive deleting when using the backspace key, weird spacing/font display, and have I mentioned crashes yet?  When it crashes it'll immediately give me the option to try to recover my document, which is good.  I'd just rather not have it crash on me and give me that &#34;oh crap&#34; feeling three times on a one page document.<br />I don't know what it is with the font/spacing, but there's a few times I'll notice the letter &#34;i&#34; seems to have an unwanted space before it, so it looks like &#34;th is&#34; when I'm typing.  The obvious answer is either change the font or to just deal with it, but most of the stuff I write is for work and has format restrictions.<br />Haven't really done much more with it than just typing docs, so I can't comment on any of the more advanced stuff it does, so I'll have to defer that to other reviews.  But for just basic document writing, I'll have to not recommend this to anyone.  In the mean time, I'm just writing on Google Docs (as long as I have an internet connection) and do my work there.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Got it for my daughter for her birthday since she absoluted loved the movie.  Always great for mommy daughter movie time.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Good book, I enjoyed it more than the movie and had to read over and over. Kindle format was nice!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|A friend told me about this series and now I'm a huge fan, Love the series would recommend to any one
0316228532|4.0|===============<br />REVIEW SUMMARY:<br />===============<br />A highly dramatic, very cathartic, character-focused drama with lots of small-town gossip. I enjoyed it and recommend it!<br /><br />========<br />DETAILS:<br />========<br />I am a big fan of the Harry Potter books, so I wanted to read this one, especially after seeing a fascinating interview with Joanne Rowling in the New Yorker Magazine. I was especially interested after seeing her make the statement, in that interview, that she had forced herself to keep the details of romance out of the harry potter books because she'd felt it wasn't appropriate to mix realistic romance and magical creatures. And so, she said, she wrote this book in exactly the way that she wanted.<br /><br />========<br />For the benefit of Harry Potter fans, the biggest differences between this book and Harry Potter are: (A) Level of Suspense and (B) Negativity.<br /><br />(A) Level of Suspense<br />In contrast to the Harry Potter books, which I found to be extremely suspenseful, \\"Casual Vacancy\\" is very slow paced. After you have read it, you might look back and think that she could have begun or ended the story at multiple points before and after the story's timeline, since all the plot threads meander along slowly. The suspense, for me, picked up greatly at about the 66% mark, where lots of dramatic scenes start to occur. However, the first two thirds was difficult for me to read as there are a lot of characters with a lot of detailed little thoughts and points of view that you have to soak up before the plot can start moving.<br /><br />(B) Negativity.<br />Also in contrast to the Harry Potter books, which might be described as \\"dark,\\" the atmosphere of \\"Casual Vacancy\\" might be described as \\"abysmal\\" or \\"pitch black.\\" For the first two thirds of the book, almost nothing good happens to any characters. Some children are cruel to each other, some are cruel to parents, while other parents are cruel to children, and each other. All the characters start out as either cruel, sad and pathetic, or both. I have a hard time with books if there is no one to be sympathetic to, and so I found this extremely depressing. However, by the second half, the characters \\"Andrew\\", \\"Samantha\\", and \\"Sukhvinder\\" had emerged as reasonable and flawed yet sympathetic people.<br /><br />=================<br />My Criticism:<br />=================<br />I enjoyed the book, and found it most enjoyable when I visualized it as a slow-paced TV drama, focusing on gossip among a small group of families.<br /><br />If I were to critique it as though a peer had written the book, these are the points I'd bring up:<br />===========<br />1 - There are not too many characters, but the deep thoughts of a large list of characters are all explicated in great detail, and I feel this isn't necessary. While they are interesting in how detailed and relatable all their interior worldviews are, I feel that ultimately (a) this slows down the plot too much and (b) characters might be more interesting to watch if you only knew the inner thoughts of a few of them and had to guess at the rest.<br /><br />2 - A lot of the characters, specifically the ones identified as living in poverty, had their dialogue written with such strong accents (often, the majority of letters in words are removed) that I initially thought they had speech impediments or mental problems, until I realized that that was just their accent. This took a long time to get used to, and I ended up feeling that lighter indicators of these characters' accents would have made them easier to understand and more importantly, easier to relate to.<br /><br />3 - The book feels like it has a big political dimension. It's in favor of the government having a 'social safety net' for the poor, and other leftist ideas. This is totally fine and I myself agree. However, it was just awkward that in one of the penultimate chapters, one character takes a bold, righteous stand against teenagers using anti-LGBT slurs, and then in the final scene, which is clearly supposed to be positive and triumphant, anti-LGBT slurs are used repeatedly. Anyway I thought the political dimension was fine, it was just that the final scene felt awkward.<br /><br />4 - The \\"Samantha & Miles\\" conclusion didn't totally make sense to me. Samantha's epic frustration disappeared only because Howard had a heart attack? I didn't get it.sing anti-LGBT slurs, and then in the final scene, which is clearly supposed to be positive and triumphant, anti-LGBT slurs are used repeatedly. Anyway I thought the political dimension was fine, it was just that the final scene felt awkward.<br /><br />4 - The \\"Samantha & Miles\\" conclusion didn't totally make sense to me. Samantha's epic frustration disappeared only because Howard had a heart attack? I didn't get it.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Love this game but this version is only a partial game. I want the whole version with all levels availble for andriod devices
B008XG1X18|5.0|My newest addiction is Pinterest, so much to see and learn from here. I love it, totally! I can spend hours here!!
B003M7BLOW|5.0|A great price on a 4 Core CPU<br /><br />These processors work great for heavily used office machines without breaking the bank.
B006O6F932|5.0|This is a great toy and I give it 5 stars! Mattel actually put some real thought and effort into designing this product and it shows. This is ONE product that helped to redeem Mattel in my eyes and I hope they continue to make things that are this cool in the future. I almost stopped collecting Monster High due to some issues I had with the company (like the availability and the price gouging of the dolls) and the quality BUT I am 100% happy with this product and willing to give Mattel another chance.<br /><br />I honestly wasn't going to buy it because I was afraid it would fall apart like the dolls but I am happy to say, it is fairly sturdy and it has a clever, space saving design. It is quite amazing that it folds up so flat and compact but YET it opens up and is much larger than I expected. This probably isn't a play set for very young children but it should hold up for kids who are careful with it. It also has small parts so parents should note the warnings and age recommendations if there are small children in the household. I would say ages 3 and up sounds about right but with all the tiny details this would probably be enjoyed most by children 5 and up.<br /><br />I am a collector and I make doll clothing and furniture. I was able to put whatever of my own dolls and items, take photos and I didn't have any issues with things collapsing or breaking off. There isn't much assembly required for the building but parents and kids MIGHT want to look at the directions before they open it. Unfolding the building is a little bit complicated but once you get the hang of this, it isn't that difficult. It has a lot of moving parts but if you unfold everything the proper way, it should all line up and be stable. This was not designed for rough play but it should hold up well so long as it doesn't get wet or stepped on.<br /><br />Applying the decals and putting all the other items together wasn't difficult, though a child under 8 or so might need some help with this part.The desks, the lunch table and the bleachers have a lot of tiny parts but once snapped together, they will hold the dolls properly. Some of the removable outer parts like the gargoyle towers in front and the casket ball net might be better off being stored in a separate container when not in use. The same goes for the removable spider webs. You also can't store any dolls or furniture IN the building when it is folded up but being that it folds up so flat, this isn't a big deal if you have a container for doll furniture.<br /><br />Other good points include the sturdy handle for easy lifting and storage. The handle also folds down into the toy so it isn't likely to break off. I also love the bright colors and it looks very close to the Monster High cartoons. The pictures on Amazon are also a great representation of the product though I have to say, it is even bigger, cooler and more fun than I ever expected! I haven't had this much fun with a dollhouse since I was a kid! It think it is very cool how so many modern toy designers are thinking of designs which look great and which save space.<br /><br />I paid 59$ for this toy plus the shipping cost. It arrived on time and the box and the toy were in perfect condition. I would say this is a fair price for this item. It is really cool toy but I would NOT suggest that parents or collectors go paying some silly high price for it. Around 60-80 dollars is what this item is worth and at that price it IS 100% worth buying if you are a Monster High fan. I hope all the kids out there have FUN with this toy and I also hope that this toy doesn't go up to 300 bucks or something crazy like that. It would be a shame for kids to miss out on this just because the company can't make enough.<br /><br />Monster High products have made me mad a few times. Mattel doesn't have the best customer service. The dolls are flimsy and tend to break, even when you are careful with them. All I do is take pictures and make clothing for the dolls andI still have had a few problems even though no children have ever played with the toys. Mattel made some improvements but there are still some quality issues with the dolls and some BIG issues with the dolls being hard to find and ridiculously overpriced. Mattel ALSO won't send you a replacement and they claim they are \\"out of stock\\" of everything. This isn't cool for kids, or collectors and Mattel still has a long way to go when it comes to sorting out some of the issues with the Monster High brand. They ALSO need a huge kick in the butt when it comes to customer service. If you call them, they aren't really helpful and they can't replace anything even if you offer to pay for it. At best, they will send you a coupon for the item and basically tell you \\"Oh well\\" if you can't find the same item in a store.<br /><br />This IS a very cool toy but I will warn anyone who is into Monster High of ONE thing: DON'T pay more than what the item is worth. The toys are worth paying the suggested retail price. Anything more is a total rip off and you aren't paying for quality. You are paying because people at Mattel can't keep up with their customers and they refuse to make extra of popular items. I will pay a high price for a rare collector's item that is old but I REFUSE to pay 65-300 dollars for a Monster High toy that isn't rare and just came out last year and SHOULD cost 20-50 bucks. This is a cute fun and fairly durable toy but it IS made of thin plastic with cardboard walls. As long as you buy it for the right price, this is a great product. If they jack up the price to over 100 dollars, do yourself and your kids a favor and buy a nice wooden dollhouse. I hope this is a fair, honest and balanced review!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Even after I finished reading it I couldn't stop thinking about it. Such a well-crafted novel - the character development was excellent. I kept thinking about thd \\"people\\" in this book long after I set the book down. I have book hangover!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Great easy to understand documentary on the global financial crisis.  Matt Damon was a great narrator and it is an easy to follow idiots guide on how it started and what eventuated and what was promised and just have never been acted on.  Highly recommended.
B005LAII80|5.0|I don't review many products on here, but I had to review this. Dredd is going to be one of the great cult comic book movie films of all time. Why you ask? For one, it's faithful to the comic, and as a fanboy, that's a huge gold star. Two, Urban is amazing in this. It's a huge ass kicking movie from start to finish, I hope this becomes beloved and there's a second one coming out soon. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie. It's a shame the studio's didn't properly advertise this.

0062112430|3.0|With the hype surrounding this series, Delirium had quite high expectations to meet. So, as with any review but especially with this one, please take everything I'm about to criticize with a grain of salt - it's virtually impossible to live up to the kind of expectations people had mentally prepared me for with Delirium. While I really enjoyed Oliver's prose and I yearned to believe in the world she had created, the slightly stagnant first half, the inconsistent world building and rather stereotypical characterization all gave me pause.<br /><br />As with any dystopian, a certain suspension of disbelief is required in order to immerse oneself into a world that is so different from the one we currently inhabit. The problem I had with Delirium was my inability to suspend disbelief to the point where I could fathom a world where love is seen as a disease, and I think most of my inability to believe was rooted in Olivers' characters' nonchalance toward their punishments for breaking laws concerning showing affection. Having been raised to fear love and all of its symptoms, and having witnessed her mother's depression (and eventual suicide) after repeated attempts to cure her were ineffective, Delirium's protagonist Lena should have had a healthy fear of anything associated with love and an understanding of the repercussions if someone fails to comply with government regulations surrounding the disease. But shortly after meeting Alex, Lena is breaking curfew, touching him in front of Cureds, and eventually, making out with him in dark alleys like she had no fear for the consequences of getting caught - which, as Alex enlightened her, for some meant death. So to experience something she has been taught to fear, with a person she barely knows, Lena puts her life on the line.<br /><br />This, I might have been able to believe, if it hadn't been for Lena's abhorrence towards her best friend Hana, when she began to question the government. At every turn, as soon as Hana mentioned something illegal - whether it was internet sites that played non-sanctioned music, post-curfew co-ed parties with live bands, or thoughts about love being normal - Lena was the first person to shut her down by reciting some government propaganda or by listing the benefits of the cure. She was also the first to point out what kind of fate Hana could expect, if anyone were to catch her in any of these illegal activities. So the real problem for me with Delirium, was why Lena was so quick to set aside all of her reservations.<br /><br />My inability to understand in her actions aside, I did mostly like Lena as a protagonist. Even though her actions were sporadic, and she was constantly at war with herself, I empathized with her struggle to decide what she should - what she wanted - to believe. It was her relationship with Alex, or more-so Alex, that I didn't overly enjoy. Yes their love story was adorable, and his reasons for being so fascinated with her had me grinning. I also really enjoyed that they had an entire summer to fall in love, and that we got to witness some of their stolen moments together - instead of being forced to believe in instant lust-is-love. But Alex as a person? He fit the stereotypical YA guy-mould to a tee. Attractive, arrogant and mysterious? Check. Troubled by a dark secret and haunted by a sad past? Check. Slightly stalkerish? Unfortunately, check. I really think Kat Kennedy said it best, \\"Alex felt like a def­i­n­i­tion of desir­able love inter­est instead of actu­ally being a per­son Lena fell in love with.\\" His character had no depth, no spark, and thus, he and I shared no connection.<br /><br />My issues aside, I did really enjoy reading Delirium - Oliver's prose is simply beautiful and I found myself taking frequent breaks to just marvel over how well something flowed, or how poignantly it resonated with me.<br /><br />\\"You have to understand. I am no one special. I am just a single girl. I am five feet two inches tall and I am in-between in every way. But I have a secret. You can build walls all the way to the sky and I will find a way to fly above them. You can try to pin me down with a hundred thousand arms, but I will find a way to resist. And there are many of us out there, more than you think. People who refuse to stop believing. People who refuse to come to earth. People who love in a world without walls, people who love into hate, into refusal, against hope, and without fear. I love you. Remember. They cannot take it.\\"<br /><br />And her descriptions were so vivid, so clear, that I couldn't help but nod along in assent.<br /><br />\\"Love: a single word, a wispy thing, a word no bigger or longer than an edge. That's what it is: an edge; a razor. It draws up through the center of your life, cutting everything in two. Before and after. The rest of the world falls away on either side.\\"<br /><br />If nothing else, I think Delirium deserves a read solely for its prose.<br /><br />Though I had issues, I enjoyed Delirium; maybe not as much as I was expecting to, but I enjoyed it nonetheless and I'm interested to see where the sequel, Pandemonium, takes Lena and to see what happens with Alex.d I am in-between in every way.

B007SGM084|5.0|The first book was a little extreme for me but I loved the two other books because they got more into a story and not just porn stuff. It was great to see how Christian turned into a decent person and how Ana was there to help complete this.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|my real calculator couldn't do what this calculator could do. I was doing homework and had to add, subtract and multiply negative numbers. I had my kindle on and found this app, downloaded it and was done with my homework quickly. I have used it since then instead of my old one.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I started reading this series out of curiosity and a want to see what other friends had gotten out of it. I gathered a decent amount of interest in the story and the characters and finished the book quickly. It was an easy read and as I had heard wasn't too mentally challenging.<br />Bottom line, it was good enough to keep me interested and is good enough to interest me in reading the other two books.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|everyone needs to have this app! whenever I show anyone my kindle fire hd I show them this game first. it is a must have even if you're not a gamer.

B009VSW15Y|5.0|this has turned my kindle fire hd into a camcorder!<br />yes I also agree that they should have included this with the kindle, but they didn't. so make sure you buy this app!<br />it does take some getting used to and make sure you don't try this out the second before you need it.<br />Helpful Hints:<br />- lock down the screen first. swipe your finger down from the top of the screen and change the top left corner word to locked.<br />- when you're videoing make sure the tiny camera lens is on the bottom.<br />- make sure you're filming in 720 not 1080. to check this click &#34;camcorder&#34;<br />then click on the object that I can only describe as 3 very small horizontal lines with a few  tiny vertical lines intersecting them.<br />- only do 90 seconds at a time. just keep quickly stopping it by tapping the red button one time for off and tap it a second time for recording again.<br />- if you'd like to email a video you FIRST have to click the &#34;labs &#34; button on the bottom of the main screen.<br />then click &#34;low- res video camcorder&#34; and video from there.<br />- turn the volume all the way up.<br />- I usually have to aim my kindle lower than my guess would be so that I don't just video the tops of everybody's heads or higher (on accident)<br />- if you want to delete a video (or picture also) go into personal videos and hold your finger on it for 2seconds and it'll ask you if you want to delete it. Or go into photos and hold your finger on the photo for 2 seconds...<br />- don't forget to practice aiming before the big event!<br /><br />Again, I ALSO wish that they included this app already and I ALSO wish they just installed a rear camera but because they didn't...I'll take this $.99 extra any day.

B005LAII3U|2.0|Everyone who thought the 1990 version with Arnold didn't have enough action . . . this remake is for you.  The sane portion of humanity can safely pass on it.  The plot was not improved upon; in fact, it got much worse.  Someday, we will be able to travel to Mars, but we're never going to be able to build a subway through the center of the earth, because it is semi-molten and super hot, and may have an impenetrably hard metal core.<br /><br />There is nothing whatsoever original in this movie; everything is borrowed from other, superior movies.  The atmospherics are borrowed from \\"Blade Runner,\\" the robot soldiers are borrowed from a bunch of other movies including star wars, etc.  The action is so grotesquely overdone, and goes on so long, it becomes pointless and boring.  There's a fight/chase scene that takes place on a system of vertical and horizontal elevator/people movers that looks more like a video game than anything that could be used to transport human beings.<br /><br />The whole thing is just pointless, stupid, and boring.  I give it two stars because I realize it could have been worse:  I saw parts of the remake of \\"Conan the Barbarian,\\" and that was completely unwatchable.  Even though this is inferior to the original, and becomes boring, you never have to turn it off completely and watch something else (which was the case with the \\"Conan\\" remake).

0439023521|3.0|Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games (Scholastic Press, 2008)<br /><br />Okay, so, yeah. I guess I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. And honestly, when it comes to YA series with fuss these days, I pretty much expect to be disappointed, as they range from the mediocre (Harry Potter) to the downright awful (Twilight). So in that respect, I have to admit I was kind of pleasantly surprised by The Hunger Games, the first book of Suzanne Collins' trilogy about Katniss Everdeen's adventures in some sort of post-war society (we're not given details about what happened to the world in this first novel). On the other hand, it's kind of Battle Royale lite, and given what a fan I am of Takami Koushun's novel, I was kind of disappointed in that regard. That said, there are a lot of pretty durned good books that are based on other books (Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres, of course, is a direct descendant of King Lear, for example), so I'm not going to ding it too hard for that, despite Collins' insistence that she was entirely unaware of Koushun's novel (or the smash-hit cult film based on it).<br /><br />Plot: Katniss Everdeen is sixteen years old, living on the fringes of District 12 in the continent of Panem, a post-apocalyptic North America (District 12 corresponds in modern geography to the Appalachians; basically, Katniss is from Kentucky/West Virginia/somewhere in there). She and her best friend spend their days slipping the fences that separate the \\"civilized\\" parts of society from the wilds, hunting the beasts that the fences are designed to keep out, and selling the meat on the black market. Despite the illegality of her way of making a living and the stigma attached to her family since her mother, once a noted herbalist, went insane following the death of her husband, Katniss is a popular figure in District 12. The year's selection contest for the Hunger Games is coming up, and this is the last year Katniss is eligible; one more year and she can breathe a sigh of relief. On the other hand, her sister Primrose is old enough to be eligible for the first time...and when the selection comes around, inevitably, Primrose is chosen. Katniss steps up in her place and joins Peeta Malark, the son of the local baker, as the tribute from District 12.<br /><br />Then come the games themselves, and if you've read Battle Royale or any of the other pieces of literature that pursue this same line of thinking, you know what's going to happen: everyone gets tossed into an arena, and everyone fights until there's only one person left. It's an inherently interesting concept, as long as the author is capable of building solid, three-dimensional minor characters. Collins is, though perhaps she's not as good as Koushun (and this, by the by, is where the film adaptation of Battle Royale fails; we lack a sense of many of the minor competitors). But we get to know Katniss and Peeta's opponents without the team ever conversing with them, through Katniss' keen sense of observation; she finds unexpected allies in interesting places, expected enemies in even more interesting places, and comes to realize that she's not the only cunning contestant to be found on the grounds. Overall, we've got a bunch of interesting characters in an interesting situation, well-written enough to keep the suspense ratcheted up without the whole b ook deflating when we pause briefly once in a while to advance the are-they-or-aren't-they? romance subplot between Katniss and Peeta (unfortunately the book's weak spot; it advances rigorously along old-Harlequin-formula-romance-novel lines).<br /><br />While writing this review, I've actually talked myself into revising my initial rating upwards a bit; I realized some stuff about it I didn't while I was originally reading the novel. It's a nifty little thing, perhaps not as deserving of the incredible amount of hype as it could have been, but certainly not a disappointment in most ways. It's good enough to make me look forward to reading the other two novels in the trilogy. ***eading the other two novels in the trilogy. ***

B00338QENI|3.0|It is interesting due to the fact that it is a historical account. However, I feel that it is too long for the amount of information it offers. The fictional twist offered to make it more readable makes it, in my opinion the opposite effect.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|I chose the book because of several different people suggesting it was a fun page turner.  Unfortunately, I found it to be dull, boring, predictable and slow.  It took me a month to plow through the book.  I found myself making excuses not to read.  The story may be more appropriate for a teenager.

My only dislike would be that there's only 4 charecters but I'm pretty sure there's gonna be an update for that eventually so I'm still gonna rate it five stars

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I think the original Swedish movie was better but this remake was still good.  Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer are excellent actors and did not disappoint.  Rooney Mara was good and did an excellent job - although I thought Noomi Rapace was better and the definitive Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />That's said, I am glad to own this movie.  Love the cover!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great storytelling, characters were believable, held on till the very end. I would highly recommend this book only if you have read the first book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is awesome and cool in the good way. Some people think it's a rip off but no it isn't. Know there's a zipline a mineral place and instead of 6 monkey's there's one big one.
B0040GUE38|1.0|The movie went nowhere.  Very little information on the phenomenon was given at the end and hardly anything was resolved.  It was also an extremely slow paced for a movie with little to offer.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|One if the best books I've read in some time. A story that is utterly remarkable, wonderful characters and incredibly creative storytelling. Don't miss this wonderful book!
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put this down. Even reading it for the 2nd time I was completely captivated and enthralled. Much like Anastasia, I couldn't get Christian Grey out of my head. Well done!
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Essential gangster drama loaded with humor.  Will make you realize all of the classic lines you have probably heard in normal conversation withoout a movie reference. Must see.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Recommended by Dr Oz.  This one has better choices and sounds.  JustJust wish I could save my custom timer. But that's a minor issue.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i waited forever but its here .this is great I really love it also I recomend it along with temple run
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A must see!  Witty, interesting, creative.  I especially love Maggie Smith's character.  If you like historial fiction, this is the series for you.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a well written book and I enjoyed reading it. I was just disappointed with the ending. I was expecting it to end differently.
030746363X|4.0|Some of the book was irrelevant to me and most people, but the rest was full of some really good, eye opening stuff.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Missed this episode and could not continue on with the series with a gap in the story line. So glad that I purchased and didn't miss any of the drama.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|One of the most suspenseful series ever!  The premise is entirely possible, even probable and frightening all at the same time, considering the current world situation.  A must see.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Absolutely loving this app. lets you choose from a variety of sounds to relax and rest. Just came back from vacation, yet the sounds keep taking me back to the beach and rainforest.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie, as I'm a big fan of the previous trilogy. I'm an hour and a half into it as we speak, and it feels like I've been watching four hours. I can't tell what's going on, why it is, or why they need to do what they're doing. If a guy in the factory in the Philippines can identify a woman from the US as a fugitive, why couldn't anyone before she left the US ?<br /><br />It barely makes sense, but Rachel is hot as always. After the movie was over, my apartment smelled like farts.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is cool it tells you how much battery you have left and how much time to use it
B0007939NO|5.0|One of the best musicals ever - my husband and I both love this movie.  We didn't know that Brigadoon is actually about the Bridge over the River Doon in Scotland!
B005NKGEP2|5.0|This book was a real page-turner with lots of plot twists.  I dare you to figure it out early.  Hah!
B001OGLPZI|5.0|If you like Prine, you will love this album.  If you don't know Prine, you should buy this album.  Prine tells stories, some funny, some sad, that we all need to hear.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was very engrossing and entertaining.  I switched my suspicions with each new chapter and neglected my housework to see what happened next.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was a good read.  However, as the story unfolds, the plot becomes outlandish and corney.  The ending was disappointing.  Sorry..  :(
B007PFD90G|4.0|I enjoyed this much more than I do his fiction writing.  Just proves truth can be stranger.<br />I like to be concise.
B004VOBIE8|3.0|i have this app installed, it is usable but is not the best app out there for free use,file manager free is better
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This album has struck the right amount of soul and musical grit. This band will definitely inspire others to do the same.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|this is the best e-reader app out there. i am using this app and it sync between 2 different tablets and my pc. other apps work ok but this is the best.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Sucked because the definitions were no acuate the words were a little different than i thought so buy this dictionary

B00AGOGOLE|1.0|love the kindle fire BUT  this APP makes NO SENSE.  there is no camera lense in the back of the KINDLE FIRE to take picture.  the lense face YOU.
1612680011|5.0|Like it or not, we grow up and take on the mindset of those around us- mainly our parents and family, then friends and co-workers. Not all of us can say we grew up around positive, successful people. This book confronted some of my limiting beliefs about money and life in general, and also enlighted me to some false beliefs I had been taught by my own parents. I was taught to manage money by poor parents, but thankfully, I am taking responsibility to learn and create my own future so I don't have to end up like they did. I will be a &#34;rich mom&#34; some day to teach my kids about the proper way to manage money and live life. Thanks, Robert :)
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Works great. Additional add ons needed but no problem.<br />Book marks easiely saved, browser very good<br />Some issues with certain sites but that's the fault of the site.
B0041KW6HU|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the short version but loved it so much that I had to order it in the original recording length. I even bought an all region player to be able to watch it and I am glad that I did, it is great!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|What happen in Vegas.....picks back up in San Diego. The story line is interesting and the characters are likeable. Both have relationship phobias based on their childhoods but they have common goals and a plan. What more could they need?  Until she realizes she is in love and that isn't part of his plan. At all.  I enjoyed this book more than I expected to and recommend it to  other HEA diehards.  This book is going on my reread list and I will be looking for more of Kelly's works.
1595826971|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter at Christmas and couldn't be happier that I did. When she opened it she couldn't stop thanking me and yelling &#34;I can't believe you bought this for me, thank you!&#34; I was on the fence about it when I looked at the artwork at Amazon before buying and was totally comfortable that I was getting something she would love.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|a fun and challenging mahjong game with many levels and I love the traditional tile set.  Good version and my kids play it too.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I got the book because I had seen the movie and while they are close they are also very different but I love them both!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am 6 years old I wish red bird can have a blue light saber. And I am this 6 year old's mom, and have enjoyed introducing my kid to Star Wars characters through this game...definitely recommend.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Still good to the end.  May have been a little rushed.  I felt that it could have had a bit more story going on.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I'm 6 years old and this is my favorite game. I wish lazer bird went back to no cape.  Me and my mom have been trying to figure that out. Any suggestions?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just started watching the series with Season 1 last week.  Watched all episodes through the most recent Season 3 episode.  Love the story and characters.  Highly recommended.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Although the size is quite small, it is much fun for the kids that enjoy mindcraft. IT gets them oof the tv.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Loving Alabama Shakes.  Brittany's voice is the focal point of the music, but don't forget to listen closely to the the band's musicality and songwriting talents.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This movie had great humor! It is apropriate for kids of all ages but still very enjoyable for adults as well!
B007THA4FI|3.0|Unfortunately abandoned by myself and other book club members I think you had to have a better understanding of English &#34; culture.&#34;
0446554995|5.0|Once agin Preston & Child deliver a stellar book that you just cannot put down.  I have every Pendergast book at least twice and am still addicted!!

B008FYZIVY|5.0|My mom let me borrow her copies of Downton and I couldn't stop watching!  I decided after finishing the second season in 24 hrs that I HAD to have my own copies.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|...the story could've been told just as poignantly without the excessive profanity, nudity, and graphic drug usage.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great movie. Absolutely riveting, particularly during the flight scene, you cannot look away from the screen. Denzel gives a great performance, though he'll never be my favorite actor. I find him very one-dimensional, always intense, broody, smug, cocky; but he did a fantastic job with this role, despite that. All of the acting in this movie is excellent, from the pitifully endearing addict, Nicole, to the loud-mouthed, bigger-than-life pusher played perfectly by John Goodman, to the heroic and selfless stewardesses on the plane, who risk their lives to help others without hesitation.<br /><br />The first half of the movie revolves around the tremendous suspense and action sequence of the titular \\"flight\\", then the second half slows down a bit and focuses in on the characters, their struggles, their pain, their setbacks, and ultimately their redemption.<br /><br />If the producers had skipped the aforementioned drug/sex/profanity, I would've given this 5 stars. You can tell a story without so graphically portraying these things. Show a man and woman closing to the door to the bedroom, you knew they were going to have sex, you didn't have to show anything. Show a drug addict contemplating a needle and then pan away; you know what they're about to do. Shoving the gritty, awful images into the audience's fact does not make the story better. Long gone are the \\"classy\\" methods of telling a hard-hitting drama tale, and it's a shame. We all know the realities of life and the world, the audience isn't \\"learning\\" anything by watching such scenes. But I digress.<br /><br />My only other complaint is the painfully obvious socio-political slant on some of the characters and stereotypes. Whites are sparse and portray the weaker characters, while minorities get to play all the heroes. The heroic pilot is black (granted, he has otherissues, but he \\"overcomes\\" and is still the hero). The heroic stewardesses are black and hispanic (the lone white stewardess stupidly ignores safety regulations on the plane). The uptight, nerdy co pilot is white (said co pilot and his wife are later shown to be radically Christian, which comes across as comical and loony, not by accident I'm sure). The one other mention of God is by a white cancer patient who has \\"chemo brain\\" and behaves spastically rather than coherently. The brilliant young lawyer is black. The drug addict Nicole is white. The persecuting NTSB staff is white. The drug pusher is white. The life-saving doctor is Indian. Oh, and Denzel has ONE white friend in the entire movie.<br /><br />Great story, incredible action and suspense, excellent acting, just a shame it was tainted with too-graphic imagery and language, and a very blatantly politicized undertone.
0981951252|5.0|Love these concepts of successful living. Excellent for me and as appropriate and effective for my 15 year old grandson.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This was a gift and it arrived in plenty of time. Condtion was excellent and would highly recommend it. Was packaged securely.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|The beginning of the book is interesting, the middle of the book is slow and the ending is off the wall.  It's not what I would have expected from a Stephen King book.  I'd recommend this book if you have lots of time on your hands.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This a great book and story.I love everything about the book.I would tell everybody I know to read this book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works seamlessly across Kindle and 2 smartphones.  You can choose when it syncs so you don't disturb your place on other devices.  Easily changes viewing options (dark background vs white background) and text size.  A must have for any kindle owner.
B009O2XY12|5.0|ITS EXCITING TO GET ALL THE BUBBLES DOWN BEFORE THE TIME RUNS OUT..ITS ALSO A CHALLENGING  GAME..ITS LIKE BEAT THE CLOCK ...
B008XG1X18|3.0|My wife loves pinterest, so I got this app for her to use on my phone while we travel.  However, she only spent 30 minutes on it, instead of the 2 hours she normally does from her laptop.  Pinterest is a visual experience.  If you have to squint to see the details, you're not going to do it for too long.  That being said, app is very user friendly and easy to operate for anyone.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO CREATIVE AND IT GIVES ONE A GOOD FEELING THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY LEARNING HOW TO PLAY A PIANO, BUT ITS REALLY HOW FAST OUR FINGERS CAN MOVE AROUND TO PLAY THE RIGHT KEYS..I LOVE IT AND LOOK FORWARD TO PURCHASING MORE SONGS...
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|First off, I love this mouse. It's fast, solid, and cool. My one gripe is the led lights near the left mouse button. These lights are distractingly bright, and I wish the were either dimmer or on the right side of the right-click button so they were not so distracting. I dimmed mine with a sharpie though, so it's much better now.
147111614X|4.0|A striking moving and touching read of a light-hearted, young teen by the name of Charlie who deals with unresolved issues through his life particularly during his freshman year of high school.  He expresses his day-to-day situations throughout his letters to a 'friend,' the letters express a depressive-sensitivity, but leaves room for good moments too, mainly when it comes to high school friends in Patrick and Sam.<br /><br />Stephen Chbosky does an good job developing all the characters and making each letter intimate and realism at the same time.  I couldn't stop turning the pages, it was just that good of a read!  Which by the way, I finished watching [[ASIN:B00AVTMCYW The Perks of Being a Wallflower]], I felt it was handled well for the most part as well with Stephen Chbosky stamp tagging his name to director/writer/producer to the project.  While the movie leaves out a couple of key moments that happens within the book, it's pretty accurate to the book.  So check out the picture when you have the opportunity.<br /><br />Highly recommend this for all readers (16+), especially those who enjoy a good young adult read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Liked this series so much better than 50 shades of grey. The characters were a lot more relatable and the story line was so good I physically could not put the book down at times. Great read..you won't be disappointed!!
0525478817|5.0|This is my first time reading a John Green book and all I could do was be so engrossed in his storytelling, it's truly captivating and riveting work.  All the characters are beautifully written and wow the romance between Hazel and Gus is probably one the best couples I've EVER read in print.  The chemistry those two share is beyond special -- they are realistic and perfectly matched.  Not to mention, TFIOS is more than just a fictionalize depressing cancer read, but it takes the issue a step farther showing not everyone who has a life threatening cancer are not simply waiting around to die, but there are actually people who keep enjoying their life, even when all hope is probably lost.  That's why I love the Gus character so much, besides the fact he's charming, funny, and charisma for days, he never let his cancer get the best of him.  Same can definitely be said for Hazel too.<br /><br />All I have to say is: BUY THIS BOOK!  You won't be disappointed one bit by this story.  And when you do read it make sure have the tissues on deck.  I'm not much of a crier of books, but thanks to John Green's profound writing, I shedded a few tears.  He simply nails it!
030758836X|5.0|Just two pages into this book, I could not stop reading! I neglected my email, text messages, and Facebook!! I had to know what was happening to Amy and Nick. Just when I thought I knew what was going on, this clever author fooled me, over and over again, to my pleasure, I must say. Kept me riveted until the very end. Not only was the plot exciting enough and intriguing enough to be made into a movie, (Reese Witherspoon and Bradley Cooper perhaps?) but the writing was superb! Gillian Flynn is a master of turning a unique phrase, expressing ideas in ways that are so original and fresh. I rarely pay for a Kindle book, but it was well worth it in this case! Read this book and you will not be disappointed, whether you are male or female!!! This book is what makes reading so totally enjoyable!
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I am trying to loose a few pounds before vacation and this is the app!!!!  I like how it has the options to set the amount of time for your workout, and what body parts you want to work out.  I would recommend!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have switched over to this for me sleep noise generator. The looping is not as noticeable as some other apps of its kind
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really like this series.The series keeps you interested and before you know it you have been watching for hours.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|wonderful time consuming fun, great for when waiting in line or for dinner to be ready.  i like the cave and zip lines
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was much better than I thought it would be. Can't wait to see the movie and read the other books.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great new temple run game with way better graphics! I like that you can upgrade to new characters dont miss this one if you are a fan of the first temple run.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|simply written but with a deep sense of how the human condition is so sensitive, and how we can allow years of patterning to go on  unchallenged.  The great lesson in this story is the power of breaking entrenched patterns and rediscovering life and those things that are most meaningful
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I also bought heart shaped sunglasses, and you should too. I can't wait for the next CD, I'm OBSESSED. :D
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Fun movie with a good enough plot and the kind of smart action that defines the Bourne films. I don't get the poor reviews from critics. It's not a great film, but it carry's on the Bourne Franchise well. I hope they make another.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I chose &#34;Me Before You&#34; on a whim, which I hardly ever do, but it was recommended highly.  I loved this book and couldn't put it down, but then it's probably just my type of book, since I like realistic books about unusual circumstances.  If you like Jodi Picoult books then you'll want to read this.  It's well written, great characters, eventful, and informative.  Reading about the difficulty of being a quadropaligic and how it effects the family and caregivers is really thought provoking!  Plus it is a love story as well.  I will be reading more of Jojo Moyes books in the future.
0061122416|5.0|Are you into inspirational fiction? Get this book. I'm no writer like Paulo Coelho is so I'll keep this review short. It's not the most celebrated classic novel (like Wuthering Heights, The Scarlet Letter, etc.), but if you're into a simple story with hints of fantasy intertwined, get this book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show.  It makes me want to lay in bed all day and wait for the next episodes.
B009NCM248|4.0|Great album. Much heavier then I expected. Definitely worth a listen. Actually able to listen to the entire album. Give it a look
B0015DRPJU|4.0|Too good for words..Amazing story and now I can't wait to read the next one! Hard to wait to start the next one.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Changed the way I eat, feel and view the world. I recommend this to anyone trying to better themselves. Five stars.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|I purchased this book by accident.  However I found the story a bit far fetched, but most enjoyable.  The book is a romp of the old man's adventures.  Light hearted and a bit of fun.
0525953728|5.0|Good book and a must read before going to see the movie 'Zero Dark-Thirty.'  That's all I have to say
1476704163|4.0|Beautifully written by one of my favorite female musicians! She actually is a very talented writer and exposes a side of herself that you may not know about!
B001P59V5Y|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Monty Python for a long time but this is the first time I've seen the Life of Brian.  It definitely lives up to my expectations and it's hilarious: just as anything with Monty Python in its name should be.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Emma Stone is amazing! This movie is hilarious but also tugs at your heart in a few ways. I loved it!
B000I9U972|4.0|As we introduce our boys to the great movies of the 80's and 90's, this was on the top of our list.  A must see!
B00002SSKI|5.0|All girls should watch this movie at least once! It was a childhood favorite of mine and I was ecstatic when I had the opportunity to get it on DVD. Amazing depiction of growing pains for a tween girl. It's the all girl version of &#34;Stand by Me&#34; almost.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This is a great Application!  It has a few bugs: like it gives you the wrong Publicover when you Bing music.  It also stops working sometimes and will not open until like restart my KindleFire.  Considering it is free, it is a great application. However some bugs need to be fixed before it is sold.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so amazing! WAY better then Horse Life. Horse Life kept crashing my kindle. But this app has awesome graphics, it allows you to interact with your horse, and it NEVER crashes!!! GET THIS APP!!! You'll be glad you did!!!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Great movie! Highlights the history of prohibition and moonshiners. Tom Hardy is a great actor that makes the movie great!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|You should be able to just type the word you need.....you have t o do work and it takes Tim.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|Amazing talent and I appreciate that he shares his talent. I would love to see him in concert in San Diego.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's amazing, In more than one way, I can't seem to put it down. It's a great read for any age.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|This movie was too sad, though the dancing was terriic.  It was very depressing because the main character was so depressed.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It is a great game over all  I like it my nephew plays it all the time on my kindle fire my favorite part are the giant soilders
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I think the Stalone version of Dredd made people truly &#34;Dredd&#34; going to see anything else related to the franchise. This was a fresh reboot and woa what an overhaul this was.<br /><br />This is an action movie from start to finish. It makes no excuses and doesn't hold back. If you don't like guns or violence than this movie isn't for you. I haven't seen a film like this since the 80's/early 90's when action films were action films without campy drama and dialogue thrown into them. This is just Good guy.. Bad Guy and a lot of bullets exchanged inbetween. For some reason though this movie kind of reminded me of Robocop. I guess it was because it's futuristic and features an insane villian manufacturing drugs thats goes over the top to try and kill Judge DREDD and his &#34;rookie&#34; sidekick.<br /><br />I heard this movie didn't do too well in theaters probably because the original movie was such a joke but this one is like Batman Begins. I hope there's a sequel.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|When I 1st got this freakin awesome game I thought it was an accident but it wasn't it's awesome the plot the brain starts working
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is pretty cool and I really like it. The perfect sequel to temple run. It's challenging and practically three dimensional! U should DEFINITELY get this app.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is way better than angry gram run and it is way more fun than all other games<br /> like it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game was great! I wish my own horse would do that... wow just wow<br /> I was really impressed with the graphics... made it look like a real horse!
B007FIY3VW|1.0|The app said I would be able to edit my pdf files which is something I need to do and I can't! What a waste. Now I have a product that I don't even need... I need a refund.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Don't work all the time time but when it does, BEST APP OF ALL TIME LOL.GOOD ALARM !<br /><br />Download it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is another Harry Bosch book. If you are a fan, you will be glad he is back, and if not, you will become a fan. Not your typical detective, and well worth reading.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|This was such a good book I couldn't stop reading. I never been through so many emotions in one week.
1582701709|3.0|I had some definite problems with this book, but overall. I found something I could use. I found it by reading \\"Think and Grow Rich\\", which also led me to other similar titles. At the end of the day I got from it, the law of attraction, that we are in control of our lives. That's huge for me. I mean, whether it's true or not, I'd rather work with that than I'm this wretched soul that deserves everything bad that ever happens to me and when something good happens, I didn't have anything to do with it, I was just randomly blessed, or happened to be on God's good list like King David no matter how much wrong he did.<br /><br />I have to believe that the movers and shakers of this world; Oprah, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, Mitt Romney started and continued with right thinking. Yeah, they did more than stare at the ceiling imagining what could be, but it starts there and builds. Call it prayer or meditation, Christianity or Islam...or even the law of attraction, it's a great thought that there may be a higher power that works with and through us to bring about abundance in every way. It's worked for me and continues to work. And as for the bumps and bruises, the wise man (or woman) always sees the positive in the negative as they ultimately bring him to a higher place.<br /><br />John Darryl Winston
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a real tear jerker. It was read in all of one day. To all of the women who have experienced abuse. Know that this book will help you SURVIVE...
B009JZTOG8|5.0|When I watched the first show of this series I was hooked.  My family spent the entire week during the holidays watching series 1.  We are now trying to get caught up the regular season.  Great Show!
B001CZVVWI|5.0|A wonderful production, visually stunning and and a remarkable performance by Juan Diego Florez. Definitely a worthy addition to your opera library.
B0053O89IS|5.0|With tihs DVD, I have the complete series (thus far) of Bones - one of my favorite TV shows.  Love getting these used DVDs.  They're just like new without the &#34;new&#34; price.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I enjoyed seeing this movie but it will not be a permanent part of my &#34;library.&#34;  Well worth a single viewing.
0061655554|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  It was slow going in the beginning as there was a lot of foundation that had to be established before getting into the juicy details of the benchmark LBO of RJR Nabisco.  I lost interest in the book for sometime but picked it back up and it started to get very interesting.  The book is long - at times it seems like it was never ending.  All in all, a must read for banking and private equity types.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|It's one of my favorite movies.  Glad to have it in my library.  For me, this is a classic tale of redemption.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Excellent movie, funny.  Could of done without the projectile scenes.  Grand-kids watched and started doing the hand/cup audition song after.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Yet another beautiful song by Adele. Excellant sound quality and it came so quickly - received it in only 2 days!
B00338QENI|4.0|The research into this book was amazing and so difficult.  This brought all kinds of emotions to surface and made me consider my true feelings on several issues.  It is scary to think of how our laws have so much control over individual lives.  I will be reading this book again and I have told others about it.  It is a very eye opening book on several levels.
B007HJ8V76|5.0|This is a good movie . You will enjoy the acting  . Most of the things on the movie is acutely published on the boom
B0041KVW2K|5.0|After reading many horrible reviews of the vinyl albums, concerning pressing issues,  I feel that I was very lucky indeed to receive my albums in great condition. I have listened to all of the albums, I have a minor skip at end of All I ve Got to Do and the begining of the next song, All My Loving on With The Beatles album. I have about a one second skip on Love Me Do on side one of the Past Masters albums.<br />All albums look good, no scratches visable and no defects that I can see.<br />Overall I am very happy with my set and feel with just those three issues mentioned above to be of little concern for the overall listening pleasure and ownership of this collection.<br />I might add that the shipping / packaging of my box set was horrible. There were eight plastic airbags in the oversized box, half of those were deflated. This boxed set survived the trip to my house by the \\"Grace of God\\" alone!
B009X010RU|5.0|It's not only pretty, but it's a stand...but best, it's good protection for my Kindle Fire when not in use.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Terrible - duil and boring.  I managed about five chapters of this but can't take any more.  Save yourself for something decent!
B009E3EY38|5.0|CD arrived in great condition, on-time.  Absolutely incredible sound.  They still got it.  Hightly recomend to all out there wanting one more taste of this amazing band
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Exciting, sensual, scary, great love story.  The things we do for love.  Not about the money when your love is true.
B00A757EFW|2.0|This game is very diifiicult to play with just your finger. It is hard to get away from the ghosts.
B007SGM084|3.0|This book had lots of hype, but it's all just a fantasy.  No man like this exists and that made it fun to read and I found it entertaining.
B004SBX112|5.0|My children love this game. I reccomend getting this ad free version. It has alot of different levels for hours of fun.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Dispicable Me is one of my family's favort!  If your from 6 years old  to 60 years old you'll enjoy it!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My boys are hooked on this game. They will play it all afternoon if I let them. I even enjoy it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The Lorax is one of my family's favort!  If your from 6 years old  to 60 years old you'll enjoy it! Very fun movie, well done!
0316212377|3.0|Lots of sound and fury, signifying little. The usual dark humour and interfering Culture Minds, but seems a little bit inconsequential (which may be the point). Lots of loose ends, as others have said, with characters popping in and out with little resolution. A middling Culture novel, but doesn't soar to the heights of his earlier books.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Searching for sugar man is one of the best true life stories I've ever heard. Definitely give this film a try as I'm certain you'll be glad that you did. The principal character, Sixto Rodriguez, believing that the message in his music never found an audience ultimately learns, years later, that it did.<br /><br />See this film. Buy the music. You'll be happy that you did.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A fast and entertaining read.  A different way to look at mental illness.  I found myself really rooting for Pat and Tiffany to find happiness once again!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My daughter had this on her Kindle and the kids love it so I got it for my Kindle and have had lots of fun with it.
B001EC3JME|5.0|This item keeps my flashlight on my duty belt and easily accessible when needed on the streets at getting traffic moving for stopping traffic!!!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I love the new features, but this game is glitchy. It force closes when I use gems, and it it doesn't always register my movements on my kindle fire hd.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this new temple run because it has interesting details. I like the mine and rope 'swings'. The mine is fun to go through. The whole thing is just great. Even the MONKEY!!!!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Horrible way to end what could have been a wonderful series. There was so much this author could have done with this story, and it was as if by the time she was writing this book she herself was bored with the story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great Series - outstanding acting, scripts, wardrobe - the best. Keep more entertainment like this available  Thanks for providing this.
B00AYB20KI|4.0|We thought this was a horror movie and as that genre, I would not rate it very high.  However, it was definitely well acted with a very good plot, and we enjoyed it very much.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoy the callenge the Angry Birds gives me and I enjoy being able to play on my Kindle Fire.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What more can I say? Awesome movie, cheap price, and looks awesome in 3D on my 60&#34; Mitsubishi. Shipped real fast.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is a book for woman. I tried to read it, but it was too much girl thinking to me.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I am not an expert on ratings but I read most everything by this author.  I liked these because I could read them at the Dentists office on my kindle.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever I got it Jan 26 I LOVE it. it is so much.it's so easy. love it so much
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I like all the Reacher novels  I have read so many I have to keep score to tell which ones I have finished.  Now that i have a kindle it is easier.
B009SSGBOE|5.0|Donald Fagen and his music has that etheral sound that gets into your head and makes you smile. Very enjoyable!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Keeps closing after one time use. I cant play it anymore... I have to uninstall to get it to work... Lost my scores...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i love it!! i'm addicted to this show and it just keeps getting better and better! definitely a must see!
B009IF8474|4.0|This is a very funny movie.  I would recommend for good and easy laughs.  It is a little bit cheesy, but still entertaining.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a good work out.  Some may say its simple, but it is challening me.  I have done level one for a week or so now, and still feel very challenged.  With weights, this work out is kicking my butt!! I am not in terrible shape, but need to get back in to the swing of things, and enjoy this work out.  I would definetly recommend.
B002UEW31I|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies so far.  It has to be in my top 5, although django is up there as well..
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|it was fun at the bethinking than a weird glitches happended where the pickles got diverted and the game speed up very fast in the beggining of the game. pleas fix this glitches.
B008DKBQC0|5.0|This product arrived on time, and it was exactly what I wanted.  The cover itself is nice and durable on the outside, and soft on the inside.  I would recommend to anyone who likes to have the fell of the kindle when using and put it in a case when not in use.  Rather than having a case on it at all times.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game a lot and it compliments the creators and the first game very well. so if you liked the first one and are looking for a new challenge, here you go.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game it's amazing I love it have fun!!!! I had this on my I touch and I now have it in the this so yay
B007V5CF5K|1.0|THIS WILL FIX THE TOOL BAR -- I am giving this 1 star for folks that were frustrated like me and went through all the 1 star reviews in the hopes of finding a fix for that have the item stuck under the tool bar - go to settings and change the aspect ratio - this will make a narrower image and nothing under tool box. I would give the game a 5 star. Crashed frequently, but always came right back to the step before I left off.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|Using kindle fire HD-- removed it after 15 minutes. No way to change initial settings, such as frequency to check for mail. No way to manually check for mail. No folders. Basically no features at all except you can read your mail. Maybe it works better on a different tablet. But it was not a good app for me.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I have read in a long time. I could not put it down. Great story and well written.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Usually I only review non-fiction works, but after seeing the Tom Cruise movie, I decided to invest in reading Lee Child's novels in the Jack Reacher series.  Glad I did.  Fast paced, excellent character development, wise words (from the character via Child's mind), action, and things to really think about when trying to solve complex mysteries.  If a reader wants a novel that informs, instructs, and includes sophistication, as well as a fun read, then this is the second of a long series he/she will want to start reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the first book because it was free to see if I would like it and then got sucked into the silo. Can't wait to read the rest of the saga.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it is hard to get gems and you olny get one per level. l say it takes your money do not get this app.
