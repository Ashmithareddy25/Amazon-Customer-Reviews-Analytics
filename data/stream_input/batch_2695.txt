B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|The inlay complaint to be made about this book is that it seems to have been abridged. If so, that is a severe mistake!
B000SLP4SE|5.0|This movie never gets old. very good movie all around. start to finish it keeps you on the edge of your seat
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Flipboard on Kindle Fire won't load.  I put in correct account and password and it just spins, spins, spins.  I've forced to app to stop.  I've deleted.  I've reinstalled.  All the same.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is an okay game. It is one of those games that you build and build with no end.<br /><br />Not exactly my cup of tea.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It was not at all helpful like it said it was. It only gave a certain number of levels and not all the levels in the game.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I had to start getting this series,watch it at the movies ,and loved it had to own it too.Thanks amazon
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I didn't think much of this book. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini was wonderful, but this was filled with ups and downs in writting and plot.
B008220BP2|5.0|When I saw the movie trailers for this one, I wanted to see it in the theaters. But because I live in a small town I would of had to drive some distance away to see it. So I waited for it to come out on video. I was not disappointed.  This movie was cute, funny and a refreshing twist on the zombie stories out there. I think this was the first zombie love story I've ever seen. If you ever read the book Breathers, its similar to it but slightly different. I had heard that book was going to be made into a movie. Maybe this was it or maybe it's still going to be made either way I really enjoyed this one.<br /> My husband even liked it.  Give it a try. If you want something to watch thats not heavy or depressing, and have some good laughs, this is it.
B00760BPOC|5.0|I can't get enough of these books! George Martin keeps on surprising us and turning the story around on every chapter.
B00CW665VI|5.0|So witty and entertaining! i loved every page of it- you do not want to put this book down and you definitely feel like you need to read more from Emma Chase.<br />you rarely get a guy's perspective!! and it is amazing!! more more more please!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|The movie is ok. Like the humor woven into the action scenes. Lots of blowing things up and shooting up things. The special effects were good but the continued shooting and blowing up stuff got kind of repititious. I love good action films that do not have to be grounded in reality and that is one thing this movie did - lots of action, no reality LOL
0061673730|1.0|Pretentious doesn't even begin to describe this archetype of talentless writing. I'll let this turgid, sophomoric, shamelessly autobiographical, monstrosity of a high-school essay speak for itself:<br /><br />\\"They felt they had to do this because if they didn't, the entire philosophic underpinning of science would collapse. Poincare didn't offer any resolutions of this quandary. He didn't go far enough into the metaphysical implications of what he was saying to arrive at the solution. What he neglected to say was that the selection of facts before you 'observe' them is 'whatever you like' *only in a dualistic, subject-object metaphysical system!* When Quality enters the picture as a third metaphysical entity the preselection of facts is no longer arbitrary. The preselection of facts is not based on subjective, capricious 'whatever you like' but on *Quality* which is reality itself. Thus the quandary vanishes.\\"<br /><br />But the quandary of why millions of people have read this book appears. If you want to read _hundreds and hundreds_ of pages like this, interspersed with a pointless non-plot of clumsy declarative prose, by all means, read this book.<br /><br />Here's another one:<br /><br />\\"The real cycle you're working on is a cycle called yourself. The machine that appears to be 'out there' and the person that appears to be 'in here' are not two separate things. They grow toward Quality or fall away from Quality together.\\"<br /><br />Thanks for spelling it out for us, Bob. Definitely can't leave anything remotely subtle for the reader to arrive at for himself. This is gagworthy faux-intellectual pseudo-philosophy clad in a threadbare dhoti that takes itself far, far too seriously, and I'm embarrassed by the reputation it has garnered as an outsider masterpiece of American literature. This is not literature. I read the entire thing because it's this great cultural touchstone, but I'll be damned if I can find the reason why. I feel like I've been punked.<br /><br/>Learn from my mistake. If you're looking for beautiful, moving, accessible philosophy, read Calvin and Hobbes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the good ole Solitaire you know and love! Yes, there are ads that pop up between games, but you just hit ignore...doesn't seem like a big deal considering it's free! Love having this app!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|GOOD action on kindle.  Recommended for first person. Good historical play by play.  Needs a better way to earn gold or let.user.earn cash faster
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These are the best books ever! I recommend them 100%. The stories are unpredictable and new characters appear all the time keeping the plot fresh and full of mystery.
0307887448|5.0|I have already recommended this new debut novel to more friends<br />that any other book released this year!<br /><br />It is brilliantly rendered!  What a fun and fantastic read!<br /><br />I did not want it to end.<br /><br />I hope they make a movie of it!<br /><br />Perhaps round two will take on the 90's, then the 000aught challenges!<br /><br />This incredible book gives a wonderful window into the world of<br /><br />youth and young thinking people at the beginning of the 21st Century!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This was a fantastic movie.  The cinematography was amazing and the story was excellent. A must see movie for everyone.
1594488843|5.0|I work with children and I have read extensively about training them to be internally motivated/controlled rather than externally. This book is in the same vein. I'm really glad I found it because I wanted to read a book about motivating adults. I have tested methods for working with children to motivate themselves (rather than me) and they work very well. This book is well written and organized. It's based on real research and the author speaks with authority. I look forward to situations where I get to test some of his ideas out.
159463176X|2.0|Hosseini is among one of my favorite contemporary authors however I was highly dissapointed by his latest novel.  It lacked consistency and I found it difficult to follow as it read like a maze.  I had to reread several passages just to figure out what was going on.  Also, it was too general not everyone has seen &#34;Slumdog Millionnaire&#34; and yet it was included as though it is something all should be familiar with.  The intense medical terminology was not necessary.  I was vey disaapointed and I hope that if he does write another it will go back to the vein of his first two novels.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this series without commercial I tried to watch<br />Two to three shows each night I'm sorry it is finished and can't wait to watch season three
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is fun and with a little bit of a challenge but not too complex. A nice game for a lazy afternoon.
B00005TQKQ|3.0|cleaned head but had to clean after every tape played/recorded, maybe i had dirty tapes maybe ti was the the head or maybe it was the head cleaner.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|So far so good. I haven't had any problems with this note taking app. It can read your notes back to you and you can also lock the note so you can use it as a read only.
0393342212|5.0|I bought this book to help the kids I work with get along better but ended up recommending it to someone to help them work through their childhood sibling-rivaly hurts. The stories and examples were thoughtful and insightful. The examples and questions are very useful to help digest the information in the book. I also like how this book doesn't promise perfect sibling relationships but is realistic and hopeful. The book explains how to help kids learn to work through their own conflicts without adult intervention. The book also gives tips to answering questions like \\"Which kid is yoru favorite?\\" with honesty, while at the same time satisfying the motive behind such a question. Read this book if you want to help the kids around you learn to solve their conflicts and if you want to work through your own anger/bitterness/hurt over your childhood sibling rivalry.
B001QW8QYS|4.0|Robert Taylor may be the star in this movie, but Peter Ustinov as the mad emperor Nero is seriously, one of my favorite, crazy lunatic characters.  The cinematography is incredible, the wardrobe, phenomenal, the humor sly and not so subtle.  This is a greatly enjoyable movie!
B005544V6A|5.0|I just love the story li ne and the acting. It keeps me up at night because I can't stop watching and waiting for the next one
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Never been too keen on this type of animation movies but my grandchildren liked it and so does my wife.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Brandon Sanderson does it again.  His writing style is great.  If you're looking for someone who writes like Robert Frost or William Faulkner, then go somewhere else.  This isn't it.  But Mr. Sanderson is by far one of the best writers of his genre, ever.  My friends all rave about this trilogy.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Loved it, ambitious, visually beautiful loved the music nice open ended story line for expansions, hopefully there will be more bang for my buck later. $2 was worth it to whet my whistle but I beat in around 90 min great job you should be proud.
B008AWBQGW|4.0|As in another review I prefer God and Guns but this album is good too. You should definitely buy this one.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|I dig this album. It has some really rockin' songs, but one too many ballads to get 5 stars. Still def worth the price of admission.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Finally made a GREAT SUPERMAN movie!!!!!!!!! AWESOME action! Loved the storyline. Could have been more in depth and longer!!! But a AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!!!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|this is a classic in the since of the years it was made and a teen movie for its day but still a classic.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I read the first book and decided there was no way I was not reading the next 2 of this trilogy.  Exciting, fun and smartly written.  I would recommend this to young adults anytime.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|The boy lawyer returns in this novel from John Grisham.  This time he joins forces with other community groups to opposed a plan by the Governor and County Commissioners to build a bypass around the city.
B004GIY5CQ|5.0|Roman Polanski's version of Macbeth is probably the best that I've seen. Very and bloody and dark. An accurate depiction of life in medieval Europe.
B00DIFARQ6|3.0|Not much fun or interesting. There are much better flight sims out there.  It took longer to download than to play the two scenarios.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|Have always loved Neil Young and this album is wonderful.  Have listened to it many times since receiving it and it never gets old.
B00358ESI4|5.0|This was always a very hated war but it was a great movie and showed both sides of the war with great applause.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like Minecraft! And this game! But only if you could add mods to the pocket edition, then it would become a million times better!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Backstory: I owned these in college and unfortunately someone stole them from me in a rush to get new headphones I ran out and bought the Bose Quiet Comfort (good product).  This was before the amazon prime days, anyways, no way I was waiting a week for new headphones thus I bought the QC's at best buy.  After years of good service the Bose finally broke down and rather than get replacement ear pads I decided to try out my old friend the MDR7506 and I was not disappointed!<br /><br />I forgot how awesome these things are.  I'm not going to go into the sound quality because many other amazon reviews do that.  There is a reason the MDR's have been largely unchanged since the early 90's (there have been many upgrades to the internal technology...check out wikipedia [...] ).  They feel sturdy in your hands, they fit nicely on your head, and I think they look awesome.  One interesting comparison between the QC's and the MDR7506 is the head band on the MDR's don't leave a line in my hair where it flattens it's probably because the QC's have a thin over head band while the MDR's have a thick band.<br /><br />They say professional on the side and they mean it.  Unlike so many other headphones where the marketing department throws the word professional on everything it sells, sony means it.  Quality from the sound itself right down to the headphone jack.  Half of me wants to stock up on these guys in case sony ever stops selling them. Never buying a different brand of headphones ever again.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love it. It's different from the regular Angry Birds. It's cool how the birds can use the Force, Blasters, and Lightsabres. It's great especially for Free!
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|The memory card worked as expected on a new Brother Mono Laser Printer HL - 6180 DWT, for memory expansion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and when I first got it I played for like 2 hours. I love it so much I play it everyday, and it just gets better every time.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|There is a lot to think about with this film, and it goes places you really don't expect. It was visually stunning, and had terrific acting, music and cinematography, but the best part for me was the complex and interwoven stories of these lives through the centuries and their impact on other lives. Karma, reincarnation or existentialism, or a mix of all three come into this open ended narrative, and I love working through the questions it poses.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, but if you want a movie that makes you think, this could be a real winner for you!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Really awesome game ...you can mix and match if u get bored after a while....but I doubt you will........express your inner creativity
B0047Y17P2|4.0|A good summer read about Lincoln Lawyer Haller, who defends those who are losing their homes to foreclosure until one is accused of murder.  He's in good form, and the addition of a fresh-minted partner is a nice touch.  Enjoyable escapism.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very addictive loving it at the moment :-) I would love to keep playing more levels as I can't get enough
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Totally recommend this series if you liked the 50 Shades books!! Can't wait for the 4th one to come out... Wonder how long that's gonna take!?!?
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. The main character is like someone you have never, ever met and she is fantastic. I highly recommend this book. This book is part of a trilogy, so make sure you read them in the correct order. I did not read them in the correct order, but I loved them anyway. One of the most 'grabbing' novels I have ever read.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the series and am so glad to have season three as part of our collection. Best series out in a long time. My husband and I watch it over and over.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent app.  I use it every day to read the bible.  It has a plan, among other things, to read through the bible in 1 year.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My favorite part was the ending-leaves you not only guessing, but makes you think about life and what you believe in.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Without giving you an spoilers, I'll just say that Downton just got nuttier! Wow. I literally could not tear myself away!!! I finished watching the entire season in about 3 nights. Glued to the TV. Jaw dropping, shocking and punches you in the gut! Season 3 is probably the best so far.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I saw someone playing this, so I purchased it myself and wow, this game is very addicting and will steal all of your spare time lol also a great distraction for the little ones :) great game overall.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|New version is not an improvement over the last one.  Will search for replacement. One star only because you can't give it zero.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved all three books from the series! I couldn't put the book-or kindle- down! It will definitely keep you on your toes.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Loved how it worked the one time, but now it just shuts down every time I try to play a video.  Useless.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It has been awhile since I played last, but  once I saw they upgraded it to a new version that was it. Never any need to spend money, but the option is there is your patience lacks. This game has absolutely everything you need to enjoy yourself as you kill a few hours.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I bought another &#34;Complete Sherlock Holmes&#34; edition but I got very annoyed because the stories were not presented in chronological order. So I bought this one and it was great. It's organized in volumes and it has beautiful illustrations. Really love it.<br />I don't think that you need me to comment on how great Sherlock Holmes is. Because he is awesome. So go and buy this edition.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|We operate commercial coin-op games and they run 24/7, we have to use the best fan. This is the only fan that will last more than 2 years.
1881273377|5.0|I got this as a book on tape years ago and forgot about it and recently purchased a copy of the book.  My husband and I enjoyed reading it so much I got the audio version again.  It is a perfect reminder on how to rekindle the love.
0062238868|4.0|It was both exciting and sad.  I enjoyed the stories that Chris shared about his deployments, but he and Taya also shared the stress that it placed on their marriage.  He shared an additional side of war that is not normally explored to this level in these types of books.  I especially enjoyed reading about the type of gear that Chris used as a SEAL.  I found it very interesting to hear about his favorite weapons and other items that he would take with him on deployment.
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|Such a great compilation, perfect for the summer... Baz always knows how to select music for his films. The remakes are beautiful.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I found this book easy to read, very helpful, & it just makes sense.....I am having fun doing the fun & amazing experiments.....anything that teaches us & helps us make our lives better & spread that knowledge is indeed a wonderful gift.....Thank you.....highly recommend
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|I've always loved this movie!  I wanted to show it to my kids, but then quickly remembered how it's &#34;too much&#34; for a 5 and 8 year old...LOL!  Some day they will watch it!  Super fast shipping and it is perfect!  Thank you!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is good for young children or anyone in fact. It's fun to get the animals and make new ones. Great game!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|muy bueno recomendado, vale la pena comprarlo, en mi caso me salio gratis en la tienda de apps de amazon
B009WO7NQO|5.0|In a family of Star Wars fans and frequent Angry Birds players, this game is a hit.  After only a couple of days, we are all scrambling to get the Kindle Fire from each other to play it.  Love the little light sabers and ray guns and things.  Very cute!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works and it does what is should do.  That's all I care about.<br /><br />There isn't much more I can say.
0843178167|3.0|These books came in great condition but are Small in Size.  You can get a Larger size (almost double) for same if not cheaper price from Walmart.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This new version isn't worth having. The old one was great and one I used daily. Will be uninstalling this new one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If only I could remember how to roll lol  but it's a awesome game and I love love love it!!!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I liked this better than 50 Shades - can't wait for the next one.  Anxious to see if they really make this into a movie or TV series.
B003THHIEM|5.0|This is a good, clean series. I'm having fun watching it. There's enough seriousness to keep me interested, and there's enough comedy to keep it light. I plan on watching Season 2 as soon as I'm finished with season 1.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a fun and educational. But it can be a little costly, if you don't have enough pearls, sand dollars or algae. Seems as though recoiled make it easier to collect these items. Otherwise it is enjoyable
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love this movie.  Very cute, I especially like watching the villans heart soften :o) and the cute kids pray.  We need more movies like this for our lil one's :o)
B00003CXBK|5.0|i love to watch this movie epic movie i would recomend to every friend i have. i am very pleased with the movie
B0027MJU00|3.0|The characters are hard to like but the story is so gripping and has so many layers it is almost impossible to put down. A little disturbing at times, and I personally enjoyed Gone Girl a little more but would recommend this book .
B00BIR381W|5.0|I love this show. Drama, pretty people, and murder. What else do you need? I will be getting the season four as soon as it comes out on Amazon!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how this game works. one thing I would recommend is to be able to have a breeding stable so you could breed your mares and have foals. I really really like this game.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Saw this Tony show this Spring on Broadway. I could not wait to get the CD. Fabulous cast and songs are very enjoyable.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fun challenging game, but also very calm and relaxing.  For anyone who loves to solve puzzles, this and all the other quell games are keepers.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to use and has an hourly projection of local weather.  I have no complaints.  What more can I say!!!
B0011TQLA2|5.0|I've been an avid Radiohead fan ever since seeing them headline Glastonbury in 1997.  Frankly I should not have any memories at all of that night, but their performance blew my already scrambled brain into another dimension.  In Rainbows is beautifully produced, gorgeously arranged, and just challenging enough to keep die-hard fans and newbies alike very satisfied.  The lyrics, as always, are a little dark, but Thom delivers them so perfectly and the musicianship of the band members is so well crafted that this album is a sweet ride to music heaven.
B006ZDS7CE|3.0|I bought this album thinking she'd be pretty good down the line, but I ended up only liking the few songs that were actual hits.  Still waiting to see if she puts out anything new/better.
B006PAV1XO|4.0|Took a chance on this movie based on reviews, and think most viewers rated it correctly. Youth love story that does not disappoint. good soundtrack also. At least you don't wander away depressed or wondering when its finished.
0784010501|5.0|This is an honest look into real life on the road. It shows you the struggles, pressure and the highs of life in the public eye. I really enjoyed this film. Reminds me of many great moments in my own life on the road performing around the world.
B001OSIV62|5.0|I finally checked this out and was not disappointed.  Excellent Doc and certainly worth checking out if you haven't seen it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I über loved this book. A book entirely from the male perspective was perfect. Strong, kick ass heroine and a hysterically funny and frank hero. Humor, humor and humor. The cuss jar was quite possibly the funniest thing I've read in years. I literally shared the story out loud with those around me during those parts of the book. A great HEA. No more books I have to pine or await. Perfection. Short. Sweet. Sassy. Moonlighting-esque banter and tension coupled with the hero speaking to us directly a la David Addison. Highly recommend this totally frivolous and enjoyable summer read.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I bought these as part of my new entrance into BluRay video.  Now that I'm aware of how BDs load the whole fancy menu before anything else, I'm not as annoyed as when I first popped these into the player.  I do enjoy how every disc has the same menu motiffs.  It's a good style for these types of anthology sets.
B00C2IJJDM|5.0|Good shipping n nice price n must have for movie collector . Steel cases are becoming the next, new thing for movies.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It wasnt what I expected.  Very clever--like Dracula, or more recently Lincoln--Vampire Slayer.  I recommended it to my dad--a statement in itself...
B003E6K1VK|1.0|Worked great for 31 days, then stopped dead. I contacted Amazon but I was past their new policy of 30 day returns. So I contacted the manufacturer, and after sending proof of who I was...which was really weird ( they had me take a picture of the unit with the box it came in, and my drivers license which I then emailed to them). After being &#34;OK'd&#34; they gave me an address in China (which I copied exactly). I mailed the package, it wasn't cheap, and I waited.<br /><br />I waited for about 7 weeks and had not received any correspondence from FiiO so I emailed the gentleman I'd been dealing with and was informed they had not received the package. So I figured that was the end of it. Fast forward 9 months...that's right, 9 months, and I find the package on my doorstep in disastrous shape. It was the same package with every kind of Chinese stamp imaginable. Apparently it never arrived, so it was shipped back to me.<br /><br />And that's it. I've spent close to $170.00 on an item that originally cost me $99.00. It really soured my relationship with Amazon because they could not and would not take the item back without my paying 15% of some fee associated with shipping and handling because of the one day difference. That's right one day. Obviously I shot my own foot and tried to deal with it myself because of principle. I've been with Amazon from the beginning, but in todays America loyalty means nothing.<br /><br />Buyer beware of this company FiiO (they should have just sent a new one) and weigh your options when dealing with Amazon. I clearly made the chump move somehow...........you got me?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun app for my daughter to be able to play by herself without needing my help and very good graphics
B00821OX98|3.0|Because the theme is so repetitive. Movies and series from the 60xties to current times. The same old story with a different dog collar.
B00C2IPB66|5.0|Good shipping n nice price n must have for movie collector . Steel cases are becoming the next, new thing for movies.
B009N4QJ54|5.0|Yes it is possible to take a comedic swipe at greed and selfishness expressed in American business and The Hudsucker Proxy is it. Almost as sad and disturbing as it is funny, cutting humor rakes the institutions that screw 99% of Americans every day so that the rich and powerful can enjoy the spoils and the excesses. Yet somewhere there is conscience and hope for redemption. Maybe, just maybe, we can grab it before the point of no return. But I wouldn't bet my 401-K on it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading the \\"Wool Omnibus Edition\\" on my Kindle. I love the concept of world-building here. The author, Howey, does and amazing job of dropping you right into the middle of the action in what is both familiar and alien at the same time. I'm not going to give any of the story away, but I think a relevant analogue would be \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Bradbury. This is a must-read, and will someday soon be taught in high school literature classes because the themes are crystallized so well.
B005LAII80|5.0|Finally, a real Judge Dredd film, based on the British comic and produced by a British team, who respect the source material.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I thought it would be a baby game but it's really fun, good for the kindle fire and HD, and hard to put down!!
B00C2IN77Q|5.0|Good shipping n nice price n must have for movie collector . Steel cases are becoming the next, new thing for movies.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Have all the Quell games and this one is the most challenging.  Love it!!!  What will they think of next????
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|well where to start , I don't know what to say I love I love it I cried when it ended  it was a big part of my life and everybody out their should at least give it a try and trust me if you say you don't like it some part of you does<br /><br />It's about katniss getting peeta back from the capitol and she loses some people along the way not saying how cause that would be a big spoiler and I would hate to do that<br /><br />But, the down fall is you have to READ THE OTHER BOOKS FIRST it will make  no sense if you don't<br /><br />One thing I would have liked is that Suzanne could of put more details on some parts
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Just got into the game and can't go any farther. Wish there were more levels to play. May play again once more levels are produced.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So touching and the writing is better than any other book i've read. This book is the best of the best!!
0451169514|4.0|I got this book almost instantly after I ordered it. It was nicely packages and looked almost new but because of how hot it is where I live I got the feeling that the book was very close to having a melting problem.<br /><br />This book is well written EXTREMELY DETAILED and leaves enough to the imagination so that if Stephen King doesnt scare you, you will prob scare yourself.<br /><br />There are some EXTREMELY questionable scenes in the book so be ready for some parts where youw ill be wondering if Stephen King is a giant perv but all in all. it was a good read. Im glad I bought this.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Downloaded to my Kindle with no problems.  Played for a while and it was a fun game.  Went back to it at a later time and it wouldn't load.  Saw on the reviews that many Kindle owner's had the same problem.  I uninstalled it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was great with a scare factor  this time around katniss and peeta are back for a second hunger games SPOILER ALERT the hunger games are with old victors and the arena is a clock with each hour is a new terror
B006VFLIYK|1.0|I'm 50% of the way through this poor excuse for a novel. It's hard to come up with words to describe how bad it is so I won't try. Maybe I've been spoiled by Vince Flynn (RIP) and others that are great story tellers. I can't figure out how it received so many great reviews.
1423101502|5.0|This is one of the best book ever can't wait for the next one and the movie I bet it will be cool.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I liked this book a lot, it was interesting to see how the story and characters developed. Some parts were not necessary, but overall I didn't mind the extra details in the story. Personally I love Jace and Magnus
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It fits my car cigarette lighter plug and doesn't get in the way of anything (unlike my old, bulky charger). Charging seems very speedy (faster than my 1A wall-charger). Overall, it's just very-well designed, and I haven't found any issues with it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss is a volunteer tribute for her sister prim and her soon to be lover is a tribute as well their are some parts where I so overwhelmed by emotions and have to take a sec to just calm down it was a very gruesome at times and sad as well thanks
1781162646|5.0|I have read almost all of Stephen Kings books and love his characters.His books are more than the monster in the closet or ghost haunting a house.Its also about how people could be the monster or ghost from our past play who we are in the present.Devin recalls his days as a younger man and his time in working at Joyland and the people he meets and how life is in general when were young.The time period which the story takes place and the mystery that Devin learns about in joyland.
1423101499|5.0|I LLOOVVEE IT. LOVE IT  This is the best series ever it is the boom. Can't wait for the movie
1847946240|4.0|This is very interestin and well writen book. I highly recomend it to every one who want's to be more aware of ones actions when we are talking about our habits. I have always thought that people need self-discipline more and more and never it never iven occured my mind that habits could have something to do whit it..
B001OFJPIS|4.0|I like Luke Goss as Prince Nuada, he is so handsome.  I loved his fighting scenes, yes he is the antagonist in this movie, but I still love him.
B00023BLXK|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies! I was so happy when I found it on here but my husband, not so much lol. I watch it all the time! Great price for a new movie.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app makes downloaded youtube videos painless.  It is literally one button push.  I also like that the app asks if you want to 'watch or download'.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This was a very good sequel to the lost hero. It tied up some loose ends and all in all it was great.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Five stars because it is spellbinding from the opening to the end. Anyone who has watched a trial will love watching the strategy of planning a case and how the delivery impacts the process. It makes rooting for the right thing to happen enjoyable. The characters take on personality and have their own moral dilemmas to face which is true of us all
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I enoyed this movie, it had a couple of twists I really enjoyed.  I was a little disappointed Channing Tatum part was brief.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A wonderful read! Can't wait to start the next book! This is something I would read over and over again!
B0052TDGQO|5.0|We listen to music all the time and are really pleased we added Scotty to our mix.  Will keep checking for more of his music.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so fun and amazing great competitive game plus it passes so much time incase you're waiting for something and you got like 30 minutes to kill
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is a must have. .If your an uno lover this game is awesome I love it a now I can't put it down I tell ya:)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. I play it on all my devices. Addictive and fun. My kids love it to.. I hope they don't update and mess it up.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Love this time period.<br />Jane Austin always takes me there and I hate to leave.<br />As they say, \\" it's in the details.\\"
1438074085|4.0|The best part of the 3 book set is in &#34;Essential words for the IELTS&#34;.  It's because it not only offers great words usage, but also many reading and listening example practice questions.  Through those practice questions, I was able to expand my vocabulary, and reading skills.  I didn't even have to memorize words that much since it automatically made me apply/learn new words through reading, listening practice questions.<br /><br />The reason why i gave 4 stars is because the &#34;Listening&#34; practice test examples were somewhat different from the actual test.<br />My score is from 7-8.  I wanted 8 in all bands, but the listening practice, I regret that I did it with this book.  In the actual test, almost all speakers had British/ Australian accents- none with American English accents.<br /><br />If you have trouble listening to British English, please practice it with other books.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the hour by hour app and the summary for a whole day. The severe weather alert isn't bad and there is a nice summary of the event and affected areas.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy to visit with people that I know an share the things that take place in the area they are in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for ALL ages I love to play it and I hope you will to. I recommend it to any one teens to tots.
B00000J2PH|4.0|this is what i remember from the album, 8-track & cassette! caught myself singing along as i drove down the road.
006097625X|5.0|Easy and enjoyable read. I love that it went beyond simple understanding of comics, into overall symbology and communication. I feel like this should be amongst the list of books people should to read to graduate college. It's this interesting and I realize I sound a bit crazy for the college statement.
B00471TLZS|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a classic horror theme movie and that has never seen this movie to give it a shot. Watching it today it seems kind of cheesy at times but all in all I could sit down and watch this movie every once in a while.
B0094JX07I|5.0|Great album!! The band stuck with what made them popular, but it still feels new and modern so anybody that liked Billy Talent should get this album
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was able to surprise me many times with its plot twists. The characters were believable for the most part. I only had trouble with one of the characters ability to succeed in one particular situation. I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys speculative fiction.
B000NY17J6|1.0|i have been a fan or Linda Ronstadt for decades. but this item arrived with cracks in both sides of the case; with the sound quality of a home-made copy, not a professional studio recording. this is not the sound i remember from the 8-track or cassette. and i expect better from a CD!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Don't know why this app isn't pre-loaded from the factory.  Fast, easy download, and I use it almost everyday on my Galaxy S4.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|After all these years never knew the story line. Enjoyed the old classic music and seeing the stars of cinema presented in a time before all the technology we see in today's films.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|this game is the worst game ever. i dont like it at all. Sometimes it will freeze while im in the air. In some levels there isnt even buttons and they expect u to no where the different buttons r.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Those who want the whole story in a 300 page book will not like this one, which has almost a thousand pages and is projected as a ten volume series with one a year.  That leaves me sorry that I read this one because I will never find out what happens at the end.  It was a great start and there is plenty of story,  with strong characters painted on a broad tapestry in a very different world.  Sanderson creates fascinating worlds.
1594136238|5.0|A great read. I seldom read a book as fast as I read this one. Couldn't wait to finish it.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Can't wait for the next one.  Not as much action as Lord of the Rings, but still worth watching.  I recommend it.
B00DPUB59W|3.0|Directed by Neil Jordan, \\"Byzantium\\" tries to make a serious movie from the genre of the horror, vampire film. The movie has themes of loneliness, guilt, attempts to connect with others, together with strong feminist overtones. The movie tells the story of a mother-daughter pair of  a type of vampire called a sucreant. They are able to walk during the day and use their fingernails more than fangs as a weapon of choice to draw blood. Eleanor Webb, forever 16, beautifully acted by Saorise Roman and her mother Clara Webb are  the sucreants. They are each over 200 years old and are forced to flee from one British town to another as death follows in their wake.<br /><br />Clara is forever a prostitute and latches on to a lonely client who owns a building called the Byzantium where she sets up her trade in both flesh and blood. The name of the hotel refers back to W.B. Yeats' famous imaginative poem \\"Sailing to Byzantium\\". (\\"This is no country for old men\\") Her daughter, shy and guilt-ridden, meets a young man and ultimately grows to trust him and reveal her secret life. Humans cannot know the secret of a sucreant and live.<br /><br />There are flash-backs to the earlier lives of the women, which led to their becoming sucreants. Clara is involved with a group of male sucreants who try to push off and subordinate the women of the species. Clara tries to restrict her feedings to the rich and mean spirited of humanity while Eleanor feels guilty about her life and searches for love.<br /><br />I found the movie a near miss. It includes some good acting, particularly from Saorise Roman, good period portrayals of brothels, and some stunning visual effects. But I thought that on the whole the movie was slow, disjointed, and too full of clich&eacute;s to be convincing.<br /><br />Robin Friedman
B0057VDGNK|5.0|This soundtrack rocks. I listen to it all the time when I'm driving. If you haven't seen Drive, check it out and then get the soundtrack
B00AWQEKIK|4.0|really great compilation to have. Stepehns sweet voice on these early tracks are timeless. A must for a CSN AND CSNY fan
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minion Rush I really love it so much. When I played it I was loving it. you love it
B00A6I87UQ|2.0|If you buy this in a &#34;pocket-variant&#34; You just  dont want just an paperversion in at mobile. Some posebillitys to search would be nice. or a easy way of find objects
B00319KS7C|5.0|Worth checking out this performance which demonstrates Matt Damon's versatility at acting in different roles. Good writing in a movie beats a stupid laugh track every time. Highly recommended.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|When the movie came out I became interested and thought I would check it out. It's a great story with a lot of imagination, but isn't an easy read
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The story line in this show is incredible. I watched the entire season in a few days. It has been a few weeks since I watched it and I am still thinking about it. The show is not only suspenseful, but is very thought provoking. The acting is incredible.  I can't wait until the new season comes out!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Sorry to see the Camel Club go, I have really enjoyed all of their stories, and will miss Oliver in particular
B0094BB4TW|5.0|IT TAKES FOREVER TO DOWNLOAD AND IT DRIVES ME NUTS  AND YOU CNT EVEN SEARCH NAMES YOU HAFT TO YOUR FRIENDS  TYPE AND I LOVE TEXTINMY BOO JAVARI
B005BDZN62|5.0|While there is no book like the one that came w the DVD box set, the picture quality is superb. I expect to keep the DVD set for a fuller experience.
B001M5UDGS|3.0|I bought this for my girlfriend. She was a really big fan and liked it quite a lot. I have still yet to see it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book that has you hoping for the best and expecting the worst to the very end. Three words required.
B001IF277K|5.0|worth it at a great price. took a charge and lasts as good as the original. i will shop here again
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I really did enjoy the game. It reminds me of jewel quest. I really do believe that the best part of the game is the sound effects that make you feel as though you are a pirate on the ship.
B0086213XW|1.0|I was interested to see this movie,mostly because I was curious about seeing Seth Rogen and Michelle Williams in married roles together.  I got about 30 minutes until this movie before I COULD NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE.  This was one of the worst movies I have seen in years.  Normally, I would force myself to watch the whole movie and see how it turns out, but this film was far too annoying.  The main couple (played by Williams and Rogen) is so obnoxious that you wouldn't want to ever talk to them in real life.  They were doing baby voices and trying to seem \\"cute\\" by telling each other different ways they could lovingly murder each other.  Basically, I wish I could take back the time I invested into the beginning of this movie.  Uggghhhh.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Today is officially my last day of vacation. I had high hopes for doing last minute laundry and cleaning before waking up early Monday morning to get back in the routine of my work schedule. After downloading this &quot;free app of the day&quot;, I can honestly say that I have been so engrossed in finding every banana, my day is gone. I am addicted. My name is Matt, I am a 31 year old man, and I sling monkeys for fun.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I thought the book was excellent.  David Baldacci makes you feel for the characters and the outcomes for each of them.  Loved it.
B002RSDW8A|3.0|I bought this for my girlfriend. She is a big fan and has watched it multiple time. It came on time and in excellent condition
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game is fun.<br />Some of it is challenging<br />  I like the game. I don't like having to write a review after level 10.<br />I don't know what to write since I have to write at least 20 words
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Good, clean entertainment with a great story!  It has been fun to see what the early 1900s were like in England.  Definitely recommend!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Some TV shows are so flawlessly executed on all levels, that they are literally works of genius.  \\"Modern Family\\" is one such show.  I have now watched the entire first season about 6 or 7 times, and it never gets boring.  And, to me, that is the mark of a truly brilliant show.  Though it's brilliant on all levels, from the opening credits, to the sets, to the camera work and editing, on down the line, the aspects that are probably the most genius to me are the writing, the casting and the acting.  I mean this show is so well written that it's beyond even the slighest reproach.  And so perfectly cast and acted.  It has a large cast and all of the actors are perfection.  Particularly love, love, love the work done here by Ed O'Neill, Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen and Eric Stonestreet.  They are all comedic geniuses.  Can't recommend this show highly enough.  It's worthy of more than 5 stars.  It's one of the all time great TV shows.  And I'm also happy to note that seasons 2 and 3 are equally as great.
B001C08RHA|4.0|If it wasn't for Robert Downey Jr., this movie would be just eh instead of pretty good. The villian is weak and the plot is average but RDJ makes up for it and makes this a good movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very similar to 100 floors but there is more substance per level. I love it! I'm impatiently waiting for more levels!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I enjoy reading on my tablet.  This product makes it all possible.  Good selection of works and a great reader.  Thanks.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challenging, but not so hard you give up. easily as good as 100 floors. i can't wait for more levels.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|This is an amazing film. Ryan Gosling and Albert Brooks are phenomenal. Be warned there is graphic violence so don't let your kids watch it.
1881273156|5.0|I haven't read the whole book yet, but what I have read is awesome.  I am hoping that my husband and I both learn from it!
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|I wish it had the coins and store like the android version.  It is fun to play though.  I like the different scenes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As good as the first! I love Katniss and Haymitch. A little predictable at times but man the action is  so good. Even  if Katniss can be a little slow at figuring things out.
0375413405|4.0|I bought this for my girlfiend who was looking for a good cookbook. She really seems to like which is always nice
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't ever stop reading!!  It makes me almost wish THG are real. I wish I wad Katness so I could get to meet Peeta in real life.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|If you like mindless banter and easy bathroom humor then this is for you. If you want good writing then this is not for you
B00BIVN82M|4.0|The music is great!<br />The plastic cover came though with 2 cracks in it already.  I know you're trying to keep shipping costs done, but something needs to be done to better protect purchases.
B0006Z2LH4|3.0|I bought this for my girlfriend. She was a really big fan and liked it quite a lot. I have still yet to see it
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This one  is divided into half of the story it is focused more on kings landing. A great story All the same
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Bought this to handle shortcuts while programming, and does a great job so far. The setup was easy, and the device itself is very customizable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game. have to use your brain. didn't take long to complete. would like. more levels. update soon hope. looking forward to more.
B004RKXNDU|4.0|This is not your typical spy novel, it has a slow pace with a lot of detail. I enjoyed this novel and it was a refreshing break from the action oriented spy novel I have read in the past
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is fun game, and just challenging enough to be enjoyable without being frustrating. However, the controls were difficult, at best, on my phone.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I definitely love this show. the story is amazing and really really appealing. I've already watched it twice, and ready to watch it the third time
1451668945|1.0|This is DEFINITELY the worst books by the author. There are so many characters who just hang out. Even the blackmailing angle, which is very critical is unexplained,no explanation about the blackmailer  and even the reason for it is very very flimsy.<br />What takes the  cake is that 3 years old girl  lives  with  her father for, HOLD YOUR BREATH, 28 years and ONLY AFTER THAT, SHE REALIZES THAT HE IS NOT HER FATHER!! If you believe this, go ahead and buy this trash. For me, I wasted my money
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Had my kindle stolen, canceled everything changed even my password. Did all the responsible stuff. Really appreciate being reminded of what the thief did days later having me review what their filthy hands downloaded.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|well this game is great for my phone but on my kindle fire it wont play right it drags. so on phone it rocks but on kindle fire I am not impressed
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|The environment they constructed was beautiful. Unfortunately, they did not fill it with a solid story or well written dialogue. The pace was ok, but seemed a bit rushed, though I did like Michelle Williams' portrayal of Glinda. It was probably difficult to add depth to a character that we all preconceive as bubbly and overly saccharin.<br /><br />P.S. Obviously made for 3D.
B002V9PEU4|5.0|grate product, works great, very satisfied, does the job, no complaint , will buy again, very easy to buy product
B00992CF6W|5.0|The app is amazing. Even tho it's like seven bucks it is 100% worth the money!!!!!! Good seeds are: L I F E, dumbocow, porsche, etc. THANK YOU NO HANG!!!! &lt;3
B009PK9SB8|4.0|The gopro cameras have a learning curve to get use to the fisheye lense and the LCD Touch BacPac really help to frame what you are viewing and it makes camera setup much easier.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|my friends showed me this game and 8 is so awesome I was addicted I am do happy I found out about this game
B000JQUMPI|5.0|grate product, works great, very satisfied, does the job, no complaint , will buy again, very easy to buy product
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|The game works great on my Kindle Fire HD. Graphics are sharp and clear, and the game runs smoothly. Love the cute little chimps that can be unlocked as you earn points. You use a slingshot to catapult the them around the jungle. Only thing missing for me were instructions - I didn't see any? Wasn't hard to figure the game out, but they would have been nice.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|It covers crime,science fiction and awesome special effects. Interesting seeing actors playing double roles with the alternate universe. Dr. Bishop is my favorite.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Some parts were very long and much too detailed. Great story line though and a classic to read for everyone!
B000UJ48UO|5.0|grate product, works great, very satisfied, does the job, no complaint , will buy again, very easy to buy product
B002XWXPC8|3.0|The Cleveland Indians came out the winners. I'll be out on vacation there just for a game.  3 more words required
B00CWV8X04|1.0|I received a very poor connection, Amazon contacted me and told me they would give me a refund for this movie and I have  not received one yet!!<br />Disappointed!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Fascinated by the ghouls, ghosts and all things spooky in this brother-bonding show.  Can't believe its taken me this long to discover this great series.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|grate product, works great, very satisfied, does the job, no complaint , will buy again, very easy to buy product
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really fun game! I thought it was going to be similar to 100 floors but is WAY better!! I highly recommend it! The only thing i dislike is there is only 10 levels. I'm hoping there is more to come!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but here goes.<br /><br />This book wrapped me in from beginning.  I laughed out loud while falling in love with Hazel and Augustus' story ( that kiss in Anne Frank's house... OMG!!).  I truly loved Green's blunt sarcastic humor.  And of course I wept and wept and wept.<br /><br />Immediately starting to reread once done with this review.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|They waited too long to bring out the werewolf.  Depps Barnabas is just not as enchanting as some of his other characters.  By far, my favorite character was the butler anyway.  Dr. Hoffman is great, but only Helena Bonham Carter can make an interesting character out of something so mundane.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I really like this series.  I only had a few episodes on the DVR as I was in another country most of the winter.  AMAZON made it soooo easy (and inexpensive) to buy each missing episode on INSTANT VIEW.  It worked like a charm, great quality play back and no issues at all!  I would recommend AMAZON INSTANT VIEW to anyone looking to catch up on their favorite shows!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What if humans did something so terrible that they wiped out nearly all of their kind, leaving behind a toxic wasteland and a legacy population fated to live and die in a self-sustaining silo underground, where expressing the desire to go \\"outside\\" simultaneously constitutes treason and invokes a death sentence? I could use some of the typical book-blurb adjectives to describe Wool, such as gripping, mesmerizing, and thought provoking--all of which are true--but because these words are used so much, I don't feel they adequately convey my reading experience of author Hugh Howey's post-apocalyptic thriller. Instead I will say that, while engrossed in Wool, I stole reading time whenever I could, I had more than one night of fitful sleep (and one in which I lay awake for a while just freaking out about what humans are capable of doing to each other), and between widening my eyes in shock or horror at the many jolts in this suspenseful ride I sometimes shook my head at the profound statements Howey makes about humanity, about life. This is not just a cautionary tale about the terrible things people can do to each other and to their planet, and it's not just a masterfully wrought world in which the reader becomes fully immersed, although it is both of these things. What it really is, at least to me, is a story about the frailty and preciousness of life, and of the amazing capacity for survival that people can tap into when they hold onto what matters most: hope for a better future for themselves and for the ones they love.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|A film that was well directed and acted.  When I first heard Michael Keaton was cast as Batman I couldn't believe it but after seeing it I was well pleased.  The Two-Disc Special Edition they put out is great.  I love all the extras as they get you an inside look at the concept and making of the film.
B00AMUOP22|4.0|well, it's 2 of my fave artists and it's dance, its gotta groove and I can get down to it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game will keep you thinking. It's a great way to wake up your mind. I would highly recommend it to any one who likes puzzle games. I look forward to the next room.
0553384775|5.0|I did read these reviews on here before purchasing and admittedly it made me nervous. I would actually, however ironically, suggest you do not read any of these reviews. Buy the book for yourself and make your own judgement. Regarding this book's critiques, yes, he is not a professional writer, and no, he does not posses the eloquence of Hemingway, but why would he be criticized for that?! It's a memoir from a Wall Street tycoon! I actually enjoyed his writing, save for a couple amateurish phrasing here and there, but I understood what I was reading and who it was from and just let myself enjoy it! I think you will to.<br /><br />It is truly wildly entertaining and laugh out loud hysterical. Buy it.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Great book but it lacked the punch of the first one. GRRM is still a superb writer and his talent unmatched.
B003B96AOW|5.0|It stands taller than we expected and seems heavier than some of his other action figures. He's happy with it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|There are a few smart funny dark shows like this<br />Kind of x files or law and order ci. I love it.
B000Q9IR0A|5.0|Simple and objective, a great help to organize your ideas to make sure you will get things done. Great book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Grandkids love to play this game on my Kindle.  Some games are lacking but this one they all enjoy playing.
B00153ZC8Q|2.0|We were watching it because it's a classic. The special effects are so dated. For a movie so old, it should have been free with Amazon prime.
B0093LINVK|5.0|this sweet little computer does it all! I use it to manage an extensive I-tunes library and interface with high end audio equipment. I do all of my office related work on it and it works great. No issues! I liked it so much I bought one for my home.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|I've loved old movies for as long as I can remember, and when Masterpiece Theater began the series Downton Abbey I thought it would be great, but was unable to watch it on a regular basis. My friend watched the first season and insisted that I would love it as much as she. It was fabulous, I've seen all three seasons now and can truly say I enjoyed every minute though I cried in all the sad parts. The fourth season can only be as good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run and Temple Run 2 are favorite games that my grandkids love playing on my Kindle.  I even play this one.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|this is an excellent movie weither you have read the books or not you will be entertained and constantly guessing and rooting them on.  very worth your time to watch this one and youll be ready for the second movie and or book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter got me started on these games and now I'm obsessed. I love that this version gives you daily and weekly challenges. I have it on my phone and kindle. Great time killer and lots of fun.
B008OOYALE|4.0|it is good besides the fact that everything goes by our time. the dragons are cute, you can raise and evolve them, and its better than dragonvale. you can also get neighbors and chat! its great for kids and adults!
B002UAJ0BS|1.0|I bought this on vinyl issue 2009. The sound is not good. I would not recommend it. I heard EU pressing and that sounds fantastic. Avoid this issue.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|i was really looking forward to this movie coming out. i love james franco and i love the original movie but i was just highly dissapointed with the story line. and the special effects werent so great. maybe im biased to the original but i dont know if most kids would enjoy this not even having seen the original.  watch it if youd like cause you never know, but i dont suggest it by any means.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|Andrea Bocelli never disappoints me!!!! I have watched this DVD several times and just love it!!! So happy it is now a part of my enjoyment!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|It's one of the best smart comedic shows I've seen! It's quirky and easy to follow with memorable characters. After watching a few episodes on tv, I was addicted lol.
B008M9PHWM|4.0|I bought this one on vinyl, sounds superb. I recommend it.<br />I like this album, I think it is one of the best in his late work, besides Modern times. This album sounds just like 70 year old legend should sound. Production and arrangements are simple, minimalistic, down to earth, no boosting. Songs and musicians are great.
B0000C1733|5.0|If you love the Chili Peppers-no brainer that you 'll love this cd-great songs and great music all the way
B009POCG2C|4.0|I really enjoyed this DVD and am happy that I purchased it for my library. It was interesting from the start!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think the vehicles should be a little more creative like for A monster truck there should be a grave digger and a sport four wheeler and maybe some more constructive maps like a monster ia. track where you can crush cars and drive through campers. I this k that would be a lot more fun.
B000UD08HW|5.0|This is a great mix of Gilmour's latest album (in full) and memorable songs from Pink Floyd's past. I've listened to it several times over and still hear something new each time. My children (7 and 8) love to hear the music too. It really has a relaxing, calming way about it.
1449305172|5.0|Well written book with practical examples to follow. Easy read that you don't want to put down. I was able to take away some good ideas that I could apply right away.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Hours of fun.<br /><br />Just like playing on the computer. This will give you a challenge and stimulate your brain. Hope this was helpful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should really get this because it is awesome it lets you kill mobs build amazing stuff and survive and there is creative when you get to build what ever your heart Desirees
B000IJ79WU|1.0|I was looking forward to viewing this version of the movie. When the DVD arrived, it did not work. It just wouldn't play. I've never purchased a DVD before that wouldn't play. It almost seemed like the DVD was pirated and copied (in terms of the packaging).
B000G73U5Y|5.0|steely Dan's best album. the price is great and the best part is the memories we have from them now.
0007367481|3.0|I liked the comprehensiveness of this book. It gave me a broader perspective of the history of cancer treatment, research, and discovery. It was a bit over detailed for my use; I had to sort through a lot of information to get the jist of the writing.
B000IZBP56|4.0|i enjoyed this movie as this was very good to me.  i like these type of time travel type movies
B004J4WLB4|5.0|You kind of get caught up in it. It deal with relationships and how they don't always work out the way you want them to.
B00001U03Q|5.0|one of the best albums I have ever heard. you can't go wrong with this purchase. a blast from the past.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Easy enough but challenging enough.  Great way to sharpen your mind and pass the time away. I would recommend it to other Android users.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|App runs smooth. This is a fun and easy game. The paddles should be smaller and \\"field\\" should be larger. Doesn't hold gamers attention very long, good for short train commutes or ignoring commercials.
0345529057|5.0|I have only read 2 of the books so far but they are excellent and very entertaining. Great deal for the price.
B000002LFZ|5.0|FLEETWOOD MAC ATTACK. BEST ALBUM TO PURCHASE. ALL THE TOP HITS. STEVIE NICKS DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO COMBINE ALL THE BEST IN THIS ALBUM.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have really enjoyed  playing this game, taxing at times, but good. I would definitely recommend this to all Angry Birds players
1781161097|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my brother. He was excited to hear that this book was available, so it great to get it for him.
B0039TD7PY|3.0|one of the 2 CDs did not play for me but it is a great CD. Will buy it again
B000002B30|5.0|WOW, I HAVE ALOT OF MEMORYS FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL. THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM. WE WANT TOO RELIVE OUR PAST THRU OUR MUSIC. THIS IS GREAT BRUCE.
B008RTE066|5.0|Just purchased it via Amazon Warehouse for $16.66..???  Could NOT resist.<br /><br />Looks like a lovely package, saw many a youtube video extolling it's contents.<br /><br />It's just funny how for decades the 'movie' was considered such a regrettable mess, but now folks like Peter Fonda and all come out sayin' it's 'free expression' or Beatles un-formula'ed (like they were in Help! or Hard Days Night..), or simply a vanity piece, making it seem somehow awesome, as if it's a 'failed masterpiece' or something.<br /><br />That's marketing for you...<br /><br />And yes, it worked.
1781161313|5.0|What more can I say? He loved it!  This was a surprise gift for him. Great gift for Alien(s) movie buffs!
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|I'm furious at the way it ended!!  Really??? Killing Matthew on the day his son is born?  That's the best you could do??  Like millions of other viewers I've been loyal through all the exciting cliff hangers, but I'm not sure I have the heart for this!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|When you want to know the weather and you don't, want wait you can just click and tell you what today's weather is really easy. It also tells you what the predictions are 10 days ahead.  You should really get this app.
B0091REZMW|5.0|awesome game. fun. love it and cant wait for the next game. going to go finish playing thank you and have fun
B00915G6WQ|5.0|What a dramatic ending to this season.  Loved it so much I got Showtime for this final season.  I will miss Dexter!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is cute and fun!!!!!!! :)<br />love the costumes! very addictive game can't put it down. :)<br />I love this game!
B0067TQQI8|4.0|After reading various reviews, I decided to purchase Anker Astro 2 to complement my Nexus 4. On medium to heavy use, the phone usually lasts up to until an hour or so after lunch; that didn't sit well with me as I'm usually out in the field and I need to have access to e-mail, etc. The Astro 2 answers my need for a battery pack: it's small enough to fit in my backpack's organizer, the item's weight is barely noticeable and the capacity ensures that I get to juice up my phone a number of times. The LEDs are also unobtrusive: just press the power button to view the remaining capacity, then it goes off by itself. The removable pins also help as I also use a Motorola V3 - that phone has a penchant for choosing which cables it will work with.<br /><br />A couple of caveats though: when you charge the battery pack, it seems that the LED currently blinking means that the charge process is somewhere between that capacity (0%-25%, 25%-50%, 50%-75%, 75%-100%). However, when I had to go and unplug the battery pack, I checked the capacity and the LED showed that the current charge is well beyond what the charging process had filled-up. To be safe, ensure that you completely charge-up the battery pack so you know you always have full capacity. Also, leaving the Astro 2 unattended during charging is a no-no. You have to unplug it when it's fully charged, which may be a bit of a turnoff for some.<br /><br />On closing, I have owned the item for less than a month. I'll update this review as necessary. The verdict so far: great product for a great price. Definitely worth recommending.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Always great stuff from him. If you've never heard him this is one you should buy. Great southern style rock mixed with the blues.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so fun for all ages. Way better than Temple run and Subway surf you must get this game!!!
B005MSD6QU|5.0|I love Criminal Minds and this episode is jam packed with action and suspense. The cast is amazing as usual!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's a blast to have ice age village you can pick any quest you want to do quest you want to do and make friends
B0091WNK8M|5.0|we loved it. don't worry about the kids watching this one.  Chuck is so funny.  Great movie, an awesome movie
B00BSBXZDY|1.0|I spent $6 on it for HD... the picture was terrible. The story-line was terrible. We couldn't get into it. Worst 6 bucks I have ever spent!<br />#DISAPPOINTED
B004LM72ZY|5.0|I love this little set and so does my grandson who's 2 and 1/2 years old and totally into rockets. This is a very simple toy, 3 pieces, perfect for those future astronauts.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Like thousands of others, I came across The Piano Guys on YouTube, falling in love with their Star Wars and Cello Song videos and moving on from there.  (My pre-schoolers have never seen Star Wars, so they currently believe that the scariest thing about Darth Vader is his accordion!)<br />I have enjoyed this CD as well, although the videos are so integral to what The Piano Guys are that I do rather miss them when just listening.  I am not a follower of pop music, so their selections based on current pieces have not become favorites - although I have occasionally looked up in a mall or restaurant and said &#34;Hey, I recognize that one!&#34;  But The Cello Song, the Simple Gifts medley, and Code Name Vivaldi are good over and over.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|Much better than the Adobe Reader and has more functions. I now use it on my Kindle Fire HD, my Netbook for studying, and my PC
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this is awesome. probahly the best. It reminded me of battlefield  heroes.<br />the hest thing you can do is download  it.
B003TNM2K6|1.0|I would give this movie zero stars if it was possible. Do not waste your time with this action packed thriller...
B009CG29RK|4.0|The kids now love singing &#34;Copa Cabana&#34; not as the original song but in minion-speak.  It was forgettable the first time through, but it grew on us, and gru and gru.
B00D2HTRVQ|3.0|It is a very cute app.  Both my daughters like it, but I believe it is meant for very young kids (3 or 4 maybe).  It does keep my 7 year old entertained for 15-20 minutes, just because it has some color/design features.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Hard to put down; in depth characters you want to know personally. Details of the war were told so well
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This book was really good just a tiny bit boring but of your looking to survive against zombies READ THIS BOOK srysly & don't listen to all negative comments especially the people trying to be funny srysly just a tiny bit boring but but everything else would be 5 star
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great graphics and loads of fun for adults as well as kids. A great game for all Despicable Me fans
B005LAIIKI|5.0|One word, Tarantino!!  What else could you say other than this is another awesome movie by one of the best directors out there.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely love this show for its content and development of its characters. There are no frivolities in this series and it is really involved. Can you tell that I love it?!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Guest I have to say I'm in love with the character Drew! He is so self obsessed, cocky, arrogant, etc. But he knows what he wants and he never stops, and that is the best part. This story has me on  constant rush, the adrenaline never died. I loved that this story was all in Drews perspective, it made it more entertaining and  Love it that much more. I don't like to give anything away in reviews, all I have to say is for anyone who loves any type of romance story, you have to read this!!
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|THE GOOD: All albums finally available on CD in their original mixes. Don’t need much more than a pocketful of change to snag the 10 album collection, either.<br /><br />THE BAD-ASS: Their debut album, Rio Grande Mud and Tejas finally the way they were originally heard — Ooooooh, my head (and ears)!!!<br /><br />THE SEMI-UGLY: Yes, due to the bargain price, no extra cow-bells and/or whistles to speak of, unless you count the original LP artwork, especially the Tres Hombres and Tejas gate-folds. Still, considering the “bonus” tracks on the already remastered albums (Tres Hombres, Fandango and Eliminator) are just live versions of songs already on those albums (never understood that appeal, particularly from bands like ZZ Top, who tend to faithfully recreate the songs in-concert, but I digress), I’ll only be hanging on to my Eliminator deluxe edition.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The price was absolutely fantastic.  The quality is the best and all of the additional information makes this a great buy.  This was an impossible item to turn down for a Trekkie husband!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Talking with my Dr about books as I read a lot he had just finished this book said he liked it so I ordered this on my kindle. what a great book to read.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I liked it a lot.  I watched it with my daughters.  They didn't like it as much as me though because they had a hard time understanding gru's accent.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|This is an excellent read for anyone facing, or close to someone facing the one huge reality of life.....which is that it ends. Wonderful, uninhibited Hitchens. Not much of what CH wrote here will be too surprising to anyone who is a fan of his. I was left with a feeling of intimacy for the man and a better understanding of my own mortality.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is amazing.  The experiment with the coat hanger is blowing my mind!  This book will quickly change how you see yourself in the world, in a really positive way.  Read it, you won't regret it!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Great Movie! Only it took 2 days to watch because the movie (only this one) kept resetting.....<br />rats.....Will contact Prime to see what the problem was
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I absolutely loved the first two books...but was disappointed in this book. The heat and fire seemed to be missing. The end was so abrupt...I realize that there is a fourth book but this one doesn't make me too excited for it.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am in love with this game when I got it but now since the level seventy update has been released I am estatic!!!!<br /><br />I will continue to play this app. forever!!!<br /><br />Props to Gameloft for developing a awesome platform.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Great looking watch, Seiko is a dependable brand, and the price was really good.  I was going to buy a Timex Expedition, but for a few bucks more I got the Seiko, a no brainer.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love the songs on this CD and the way she presents them.  Susan, despite her rise to fame, appears to remain<br />humble.  You can tell this in the way she writes and addresses people she works with.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love history, this is a great read! Follett did a great job of intertwining factual historical events within his characters lives.
0553386794|4.0|This book has a huge cast of characters and while as it seems overwhelming at the beginning, they quickly became distinctive. The characters are all very developed and unique. Several characters stood out to me. For example, Daenerys is such a strong and remarkable character. Tyrion was such a funny character and made me laugh a lot. Arya was also kick ass and brave. I could go on the other characters forever. Martin isn't afraid to harm his characters and I became emotional in several place. This book starts out slow, but quickly becomes exciting. There are so many plots that are linked together flawlessly. I became enthralled in what would happen next and needed to know more. The world building is also done so well. I never felt overwhelmed by what was happening and Martin explains it perfectly. The map in the book also helped a lot. The concept of winter being years long, also interested me and I hope that comes into play in later books. This book is rather thick and at times, it felt like it would last for forever. At the same time, I never felt bored. I don't think that the story could be told in less content, but at the same time, it is a bit tiring reading it. Martin's writing is pretty good. He is really good at make a story believable. I haven't watched the show, but I am definitely interested in it now. I would recommend anyone that likes Epic Fantasy. It has really well developed character, an interesting plot, and great world building. I am definitely interested on continuing with the series, but I am going to take a break before continuing reading this series.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|if you only want one Beatles album (I guess there are those out there), make it this one....they are at their heights here!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I purchased this feature to use on my Kindle Fire HD. My 2 1/2 year old grandson and I spend lots of time playing with Ben and talking to him. We both love it.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Absolutely love this series.  I don't know how they pull it off but each year keeps getting better.  I hope they have another 10 years!!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I normally don't buy &#34;newer&#34; movies, as I prefer the older classics, but this is such an nice inspirational movie that I can watch many times when I want to feel good about the world.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun with friends and family.  especially with your children.  thank you for a family game for everyone.  have a good time.
B005HSL626|3.0|It's an okay game. I don't play it much but I think my wife does. She likes games and plays alot.
B00BGIC170|5.0|I'm getting up there in age and they nailed this one.  I've watched it a few times with my girlfriend already.<br />Oxykitten?  Meow.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Great mystery, I read it all day. It even made me scared at night. It really pulls you into it.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|She told the African immigrant story without any apologies. Gives the reader a rare insight into west African culture.  As an &#34;American African &#34; many things she writes about resonates with me. Thanks for giving African immigrants a voice.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is the only show on television I really want to see each week. I watched the whole seaon over again and still love it.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I have never seen a bad movie Tom Cruise was in.  Ever.  This one was incredible and will definitely watch it again.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got this game because i get very bored very easily, and this game keeps me entertained and excited for more.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie absolutely amazing and inspiring and a MUST watch.  It was a definite tear jerker so watch out!  I think Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are absolutely amazing actors and were a great cast for this film.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Nice to see a movie that is not violent trash like American movies in general.  This Russell Brand youtube ([...] of him meeting a gal with Cerebral Palsy is a current example of the same deeply loving unconditional impulse.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|My girlfriend wanted me to watch this (it's one of her favorites) - it's funny how much I'm like Bradley Cooper's character and she's like Jennifer Lawrence's...
B008XX6J4C|3.0|The music is pretty good. Each song is done differently, which is preferable to the same old style and tempo, and the musicians are really good. Only three stars because they threw in vocals, which you couldn't hear in the samples. Only two had them, but I was looking for strictly instrumentals.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A great read. I was disappointed I had come to the end of the book!  Will definitely purchase the next Will Robie story.
1447231171|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but apparently the series will continue as it ended on a hook.  I thought this would be the end of the series and will probably have to wait a year to find out what happened!
B0081L391C|5.0|This movie was absolutely hilarious, especially when they took the drugs.  Channing Tatum earned my respect from this movie.  I highly recommend this if you like funny stuff.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is fantastic! The best kindle game yet. If I could give 6 stars I would. The image and movement are breathtakingly wonderful. You will not be disappointed. I wish it could have gone on and on. Will be recommending this to my friends.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|The apps is great! Notes and checklists are what keep some of us sane so this app is a god-send blessing. It reminds you of things you have to do and you can color code your notes and check-lists. Really a great work of technical art.
1592537251|4.0|I like the variety of styles and is a great reference book.... Will need to read it a little closer to see if it has a good list of items to take with you on such excursions and if there are recommendations for finding the right &#34;landscape&#34; to capture.  Otherwise a pretty travelog book to keep out and look through.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|I'm a action/gangster movie lover - love sean penn and josh brolin favorite all the actor were great in this movie - I would recommend for children to watch - very violent otherwise I love it.
B008602KQI|1.0|After watching the first twenty minutes or so, I turned this off... This movie is more appropriate for a younger audience and will bore those of us used to more adult themes....
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|This app was great for someone who has stylus but really pointless when you're using your finger. I recommend it for people who own a stylus and write small and neat.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus Luttrell is an American Hero. The true measure of the courage and devotion a Navy SEAL shares with his brothers. An amazing read.
0765348780|5.0|I am quite amused by the negative reviews this book and the whole series receives on this site. It is very apparent to me that the people who give the 1 and 2 star reviews cannot handle the depth and magnitude of this book and the Malazan series. Simply put it is just to big and broad. I have read them all (epic fantasy series) over the years and am not even going to attempt to list them. I say that to say this, The Malazan Book of the Fallen is as Tina Turner sung it\\" Simply the Best\\". A song of Ice and Fire is a close second. Read this book, then #2 and by book three you realize how good #1 was, because it all starts coming together. Finally after you have read the whole series twice you realize there is nothing out there today that's better.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Le Carre is back . After a series of  slow pot boilers ,A Delicate Truth is a stunning look at the Foreign Office in all its moral ugliness. The characters are real  and even faintly heroic . The plot is delicate but gets more tensile with every page . This is a superb novel almost as good as &#34;the Honourable Schoolboy&#34; with a moral core that makes you want to cheer the protagonists as they revisit an aborted terrorist plot . In the end  does &#34;good &#34; win  we ll you will have to be the judge .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't often get to read for pleasure because my job is so busy, and when I do, it is hard for me to find something that captures my attention. The first book of the Hunger Games trilogy was a very enjoyable read. I read it after the movie and while I loved the movie, the book was better as I had a better understanding of Katniss's thought process. Easily breezed through the book in one day!
B004LQI0HE|3.0|I read the book and liked it. I never go to into it but I still enjoyed it. The movie on the other hand was just way to slow and felt it was lacking a point. Honestly I just didn't really care for it.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I read the book and it fascinated me. Just the idea of benign extra-terrestrials who aren't intent on killing and destroying is a little used tool and gets lost in the shuffle of aliens that always wants to destroy. Maybe the people are left without their own personality, but they were given a free benign life. I was very excited that at least one human was able to overcome their hold on them and that humans could even change the aliens and blend their lives for the benefit of all. The movie left out a lot of relevant episodes from the book, but this version of the movie was adequate. I enjoyed this movie and at least for a little while, I was able to forget how we have messed up and get lost in the idea of what the movie was trying to tell us. Thanks Stephanie Meyer for a delicious idea.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This app is so much fun, I can't stop playing it. This is a must have app and it free.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|LOVE this movie! It is a favorite for both adults and children in our family. Cute spin on teaching the wonders of companionship and the consequences of pollution and over-reliance on technology.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I like this game. It's cute and funny. The kids are having fun with it too.<br />Hard to believe it was really free.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It's so nice to see animals get the best of humans. I loved the idea and he even scared me sometimes with his mean look. His expressions were really reviling and you could tell what he was thinking by his expressions. I cheered when he got out and took his co-conspirators with him. I'm all for the underdog, no matter who or what they are, and this movie showed imagination, heroism, and just good entertainment. Thanks, ever so much for movies like this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 10 and 9 year old love this game!  They play it all the time.  Love that it was free!!
B002BWP49M|5.0|I love this movie and to be able to get it was fantastic! It works and is so much fun to watch over and over again.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app has made me enjoy Yahoo mail once again. I had given up on the site via my PC due to delays and stalls. But I'm loving the ease and speed of this Android app. Thank you Amazon for making it available.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I watched this movie with anticipation, but I was kind of disappointed, because it was not the story I remember from childhood, but as the movie went on, I realized it was a pretty good retelling of a classic childhood memory, Albeit, it was a little gross, the giants, I guess, never heard of personal hygiene, ew. The characters I felt sorry for was the poor little pigs being roasted in pastry, alive. They couldn't at least knock them in the head? Besides that, those 2 little pigs and one human couldn't possibly feed that many giants. I'm sorry, I know you're supposed to use your imagination, but it was kind of hard with this version as, to me, they were such glaring errors.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|THIS VERSION HAS GREAT VARIETY OF FORMATS! As well, there are a steady amount of moves available under a time limit. This is a good free version.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The best fps in the world (in my opinion) so exciting I just can't wait for the fifth, suggestion I have never played a FPS except for now if you are a first timer play the campaign first, (I never do) so you can have good results in a match, but see the rest for you're self once you're deployed into battle and defeat enemies, and the phantom unit is back but a new bad guy association is formed the SGS, a new age of war is formed. If you like the this one I suggest the fifth Modern Combat 5: the last war it hasn't came out yet though it come around Christmas 2013
B0050DIWFC|5.0|this is defiantly the best book I have ever read. seriously thrilling. and gripping. so glad I had a chance yo read this. overall a 10.
B006C45MRE|5.0|What a wild ride! My heroes have always been cowboys, because my husband was one, but I don't think he ever met aliens, face to face with a cougar, but not aliens. A great premise and I was very entertained. Thank you for this escape from real life!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|John Rebus is back, and I for one am glad that he has decided to reject retirement. Rebus is still addicted to cigarettes and whiskey, but considering the cards that life deals him, he is justified in seeking a prop or two to sustain him. This time young girls are disappearing in mysterious circumstances, and only Rebus can work out the why, the where and the who of this frustrating case, set, always, in chilly Scotland where it is not only the weather that sends shivers down the reader's back.<br />As always, Ian Rankin knows how to tantalise and horrify relentlessly and to maintain pace, plot and characterisation in a most professional way. The only thing I cannot understand is how does John Rebus manage to stay awake for those incredible long hours that he works and to drive his beloved Saab when he has been swallowing alcohol to the extent that he does. He must have a cast iron constitution, but I hope that for my reading pleasure and that of all Rebus fans, he keeps going for many years to come. Highly recommended for any one who enjoys a good gory murder mystery.
B006FE83UE|5.0|I read this book over the summer and it is wonderful! The movie is a wonderful movie as well and it is one I would recommend to you, whether you have read the book or not! This is a timeless classic. The actors in this movie are excellent and it is a great movie to watch any time!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It such a addicting game ive got so many of my friends into it. Its fun trying to get new dragons in your breeding caves or island if you chose to buy it. They have dragons that come out according to the season or holiday coming up or just unique dragons they have epic dragons that take a long time to breed and hatch but make you a lot of money or even gems!!
B005UG542S|4.0|I am an older adult and I really enjoy these movies, sort of makes up for an empty childhood. All the movies in this franchise were remarkable and I truly loved the animals portrayed in them. Daniel Radcliffe gave a remarkable performance as a child wizard who grew up learning magic. I really appreciate the genius behind the stories and they translated into excellent movies. Thanks, and I'm very sad they are over.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I would recommend The Rosie Project to everyone who knows how to read English and to anyone who wants/needs a good laugh. Graeme Simsion has captured the essence of Asperger's Syndrome in his protagonist - and done it with empathy and humour. I was reminded of many people I know when the character of Don, the scientist, burst upon me at the beginning of the story with his problem of spending 92 minutes cleaning his bathroom while simultaneously finding time to write an application form setting out the criteria of the qualities he requires in a wife. My husband, who was next to me in bed when I was reading the passage about Don learning to dance using a skeleton borrowed from the Anatomy Department at his University, became quite concerned when I apparently had a fit of hysterics while reading my Kindle - then my condition exacerbated soon afterwards when Don decids he needs instruction about sexual positions and used the same (albeit male) skeleton while following directions from a book. He is caught in flagrante delicto by the Dean of the University.... It was, of course, all quite logical, to a reader who is instroduced to Don's mind set at the beginning of the novel. This is a story to which I will return often for the joy of reading it -  and I am telling everyone I know about it. I urged you to BUY THIS BOOK - you will thank me for this advice! The writing is polished, the plot is marvelous (and I have revealed only a small portion of it to you), and the characterisation is superb.

B00CH26TL8|3.0|I enjoy trying to knock down the bubbles.  However, I don't appreciate always being asked to purchase more bubbles or contact my friends on Facebook.  Also, I don't really understand what the map is all about, or how to get to the next level sometimes.  What are the magic potions and how does one get them or use them?

B001POX73C|5.0|Georgette Heyer is number one of the only two romance authors I read. This is because, to quote her, she keeps you in &#34;a bubble of laughter&#34;.  I've read and re-read her books for over fifty years, whenever I have needed to relax and laugh. Like Dickens, Ms. Heyer's minor characters are worth the price of the book, and her dialogues are as well. For a fun escape, I would recommend most of her books particularly this one.<br /><br />The last thing on the Honorable Frederick Standen's mind is marriage, until is uncle's ward Miss Catherine Charing talks him into a pretend engagement.  The kind and amiable Freddy becomes a victim of Kitty's understandable desire to escape her unexciting country life &#34;for just a little while&#34;.  Many complications ensue on this merry adventure before all works out in the end.

Twenty-three year old Lord Anthony Sheringham (Sherry) wants his inheritance today, not when he's twenty-five. He will receive it, under the conditions of his father's will, if he marries.  A run away marriage to the childhood playmate who had worship-fully  followed him around during his teens turns out to be a very complicated solution.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Kept my interest. Flowed well. Looking forward to the next one of the series by Sylvia Day.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|An author that presents his ideas and research as clear and simple as possible. It makes for a great read in a philosophical topic that is at the base of our human experience. I honestly recommend it.

B00B7VPKMY|3.0|I got this at the local FYE, in Hollywood, Florida. I figured they would be the mini record packs. When I opened it, I was quit surprised, and felt ripped off... I wish I would have read reviews on this set. The discs sound awesome, but the packages are super cheap. Just a shell of the cover, with not even something to protect the discs. When I bought the big Led Zeppelin cd black box, it took me 5 minutes to open each disc. They were packed VERY well....<br />Any way, buy the silver box set of the Eagles. It has nicer packaging, and more like the original records...<br />I thought Hotel California, and The Long Run would at least be gate-fold...But they are NOT....<br />Simply put...\\"BORING\\"!!!<br />Jim Russell<br />Pompano Beach, Florida<br />7-15-2013
B00992CF6W|2.0|I thought this game was pretty fun until they updated it. now I have to guess where all the buttons are.
B001LF347E|5.0|Yes, it was really really top notch...The only complaint being there were pauses and catches occasionally.  As I like the series so much, Of course I liked the DVD.  For 5 discs, the price is good too, although of course one always hopes for a bigger bargain, as budgets are stretched these days, and I haven't had a job in over a year, no fault of my own.  I can't speak highly enough of the Merlin series.  It is very hard to find anything likeable on TV as far as I'm concerned.  Thank you.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book is written well, but it is not your typical read for a love/ action book series. Not worth 5 star but close
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|Good music of the film, but tits time to correct the STAR TREK time line and stop taking ideas that has already been made and done! Need new material!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Great game has me hook no pun intented. My only problem is my game always resets itself somehow.  I'm constantly having to restart with the mako shark. I have gotten to the great white twice already.  if this happens again I will be removing this game. I play on my kindle fire tablet
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|I haven't yet received the series.  Please ask again in a few weeks.  It will take me some time to watch all the discs.  I anticipate I will like it, as I liked the series and wish it was rerun again on TV.

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer version of SUPERMAN music that definitely stands on its own from the original John Williams SuperMan Theme music.
0618871713|3.0|Book is in good condition but the story line didn't really catch me. It is a nice story about being raised by a closet-homosexual and growing up to be gay yourself. I just think that Bechdel tries too hard to make literary allusions, and things within the tale are just too parallel to the history of famous literary authors.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|I thought I would read this, as I like the show.  Well for the first time, the show is better.  This book tends to get bogged down in a lot of chatter and after a while you do not know who is on what side.
0786890762|4.0|Rosie Dunne and Alex Stewart are meant to be together. At the very early age of five, they become best friends. Their friendship strengthens through good times such as birthdays, weddings, births, and bad times such as broken dreams, lost jobs, divorces, and funerals. No matter where they are, they are always there for one another.<br /><br />Alex and Rosie grow up in Dublin, Ireland.  When Alex is 17, his parents decide to move to Boston so that his father can pursue a better job. Rosie plans on following Alex over to Boston after graduation so that she can attend Boston University and become a hotel manager, something she has always wanted to be. After being accepted into college, and graduation from high school, Rosie makes one move that changes the course of the rest of her life: she gets pregnant.<br /><br />Love, Rosie by Cecelia Ahern, author of P.S. I Love You, is told through a series of correspondences between all of the characters in the novel. Characters write through snail mail, email, instant messages, and cards. The only part of the story that is told through prose is the epilogue. If you ever wanted to read a story and watch the main character grow from ages 5 - 50, this is your chance.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book because of the way it was written. I liked all the goofy cards sent throughout the Dunne family, the instant messages sent between Alex and Rosie during class, and the wedding invitations sent via snail mail from one country to another. I looked forward to the letters between Alex and Rosie the most, but also enjoyed reading letters/emails/instant messages from Rosie's family friends, and eventually letters written by her daughter.<br /><br />As you may have already guessed, even though Alex and Rosie are meant to be together, that doesn't mean this is a book about their budding romance. Love, Rosie is about every single missed opportunity that they had to fall in love. To say this book is frustrating is an understatement. Everything that could keep soul mates apart in life, happened to Alex and Rosie. If they weren't so stubborn, their love could have overcome many of these obstacles, but they were both too set on not hurting other people's feelings by putting their own feelings aside.<br /><br />I picked this book up because I thought it would be a light read compared to the heavy subjects I have been reading lately. Although the story is supposed to be light, I felt stressed for Rosie, stressed for Alex, and stressed for every other character in the novel. No one could catch a break: characters lost hope, lost jobs, and lost each other.<br /><br />The plotline I hated the most had to do with Katie's father. He should have just stayed out of the entire novel, then I would have enjoyed the second half of the story much more. The most frustrating part of the story, though, was the ending. I was finally happy with where Rosie and Alex relationship was heading and then BAM: no more letters, no more emails, no more instant messages, just an epilogue. Really? I had to read a whole bunch of nonsense just to get to the good stuff and then be let down?<br /><br />Love, Rosie will soon come alive on the big screen. For once, I hope they DON'T put every fact written in the novel, in the movie, because if they did, it would be the longest, drawn out movie ever. I would recommend this book to someone who had a lot of time to kill, like a long plane ride, a long day at the beach, or a whole week of rainy days. You won't want to put it down, but that's only because you just want to get to the end and see what, and if, anything good happens.ing that could keep soul mates apart in life, happened to Alex and Rosie.

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|They finally did this series justice by making the special effects, visual effects and sound F/X right to match all the other series (and films) of STAR TREK together in one STAR TREK UNIVERSE. Even to tie-in the deplorable ENTERPRISE TV series.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story of a brother and sister sent to an orphanage very young...their struggles, abuse and complete different lives as adults is amazing.  How this could be based on a real place that was in operation untill the 1990's is completely unbelievable. I must say it is a very sad read but enlightening.
B009WUBERW|1.0|If you like shooting and killing and bad acting, then this is for you.  I had heard that Expendables was good, so I thought I would watch this one.<br /><br />I could not wait till it was done.  They did nothing but shoot, kill and read bad lines.<br /><br />I wish I could of given this 1/2 star, cause I would of.
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor and Park could not be any different, but at the same time, they could not be any more alike. Park is half Korean and has lived in Omaha his whole life, in a nice house with the perfect family. Eleanor has had a broken family for most of her life,she has moved around a lot and doesn't really have a place to call home. Eleanor is quirky, has a head full of hair that she doesn't know what to do with, and wears weird clothes are always too big. Park likes to read comics and listen to his walkman. Eleanor has a walkman, but doesn't have any batteries. She loves to read and has a perfect voice for reading poetry out loud.<br /><br />Eleanor and Park meet on the school bus, in a very Forest Gump like way. No one will let Eleanor sit next to them, except for Park. This doesn't mean Park is happy about the situation, but he does it because he feels bad. Eventually, Eleanor and Park begin to read comics together on the bus, as in Eleanor looks over Park's shoulder while he reads. Not too long after, Park begins to lend Eleanor his comic books and starts to make her mix tapes with her favorite band, The Smiths. They soon realize that much like Romeo and Juliet, they're destined to be together, even when the world is trying to tear them apart.<br /><br />eleanor & park by Rainbow Rowell gave me butterflies the entire time I read it. I was over the moon in love with how Eleanor and Park's friendship turned into love. It was like being in high school all over again. The novel is written in third person alternating between Eleanor and Park. Throughout the story, you are able to feel what each character is feeling: their triumphs, their failures, and their love for one another.<br /><br />When I went to the library, I was surprised to see a copy of eleanor & park sitting right next to Divergent by Veronica Roth, the book I actually went to the library to get. eleanor & park has been on my to-read list for a while, but I didn't think our tiny library had it. I went home and read it from start to finish, only putting it down to eat dinner and walk the dog. It was the perfect book for the rainy day that we were having. I was immediately sucked into the high school love affair between two teens that were created for one another.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the buildup of Eleanor and Park's relationship. They didn't jump into being friends, and they certainly didn't jump into being lovers. Their first kiss was well into the novel and it had me holding my breath, just like Eleanor was holding hers. I was waiting for the kids to do more than just hold hands, and when it finally happened, I could breathe again. I didn't even know a book could give me the feelings of first love all over again. And that's exactly how I felt during this moment, like I was reliving my first kiss all over again.<br /><br />I loved how the author switched perspectives between Eleanor and Park so frequently. I didn't have to read a 20 page chapter about Park, constantly wondering about how Eleanor was feeling. True love has no boundaries, and in Eleanor and Park's relationship their thoughts and feelings became inseparable. The perspectives switched so often that you didn't have time to process the thoughts as two different people, they became one entity.<br /><br />I felt so bad for Eleanor throughout most of the novel. Life dealt her a bad hand making it very difficult to live a happy and normal life. She became an adult much earlier than most children should and she wasn't able to have everything she needed, let alone wanted. I really didn't understand the issue between her and her father. Her mother and father got divorced when she was younger and her father basically disowned her and her other siblings. The author really didn't elaborate on why the divorce happened and why he was such a bad father. She only alluded to drugs and alcohol. It seemed as if the absentee father was thrown into the story and then never really brought up in great detail. Her step father, on the other hand, is a huge jerk/creepo and he eventually gets what he deserves.<br /><br />I feel like a broken record in my reviews saying how so many endings disappoint me, but once again, this ending left so much to be desired. The end of the book was rushed and the last line of the novel left me thinking, \\"Huh?\\" I can assume what the author meant, but that's NOT enough for me. I need more, I want more. At the end of Romeo and Juliet, there is definite ending. Romeo and Juliet commit suicide and their families realize what horrible people they have been. But at the end of Eleanor and Park, it's just over, leaving you with many unanswered questions.r, on the other hand, is a huge jerk/creepo and he eventually gets what he deserves.<br /><br />I feel like a broken record in my reviews saying how so many endings disappoint me, but once again, this ending left so much to be desired.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have played most of the angry birds game. Up until now angry birds Rio was my favorite. Star wars angry birds is so much fun. I am from a time when seeing the original star wars movies at the drive in was great. Now a word to the wise. Play a little bit of angry birds in space. That will help you get through some of the levels. But the sound affects and the birds dressed as the star wars characters are great. So if you enjoy angry birds games, you gotta try it. I got the game free from the free daily applications. But I would have paid 2.99 if I wouldn't have got it for free.

B004SDSSFY|1.0|I am giving this review 1 star without even opening the program.  The reason I am giving it 1 star has nothing to do with the program but how I feel I was ripped off by Amazon.  I noticed on Amazon that they were offering the full version key for free so I followed the instructions and downloaded the program first.  I then went to Amazon and clicked the \\"buy with one button press\\"  button.  I then received in error which it was noted in the error message that Amazon was working to fix this issue and to try back later.  I tried on numerous occasions by clicking the button. This is where I got mislead because when it did work it ended up charging me for the full version amount of $14.95, not free like it stated.  I am now out $15 for a program I would have never purchased for that amount.

B006LSZECO|4.0|While the book was very entertaining, with lots of plot twists and surprises, if you like endings where justice is served, skip this one.  I hated the ending. It was depressing and sad and just wrong.  I wasn't looking for a happy ending, because I don't think that would be possible in this case, but I wanted to see bad things happen to bad people.  I feel angry now that it's finished, and that's not what I'm looking for in a book.

What happened to the scriptures?

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series of stories are a great.  That is all there is to it.  The first story is clearly a stand alone story, the next four are a separate story in the same setting.  Both are well worth the time.  Don't let the &#34;end of the world&#34; setting fool you, this is really good.

0071752854|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moXEMUBXN10U4K]]Last year I purchased Pitch Anything. The title was persuasive and so was the description. I decided to give it a shot although I despise most sales books due to their surface level nature.<br /><br />I was surprised with Oren's book because it wasn't a book you could just sit down and whizz through it. It is actually pretty deep. He goes into the different aspects of where our buying decisions come from in the different parts of our brain. He also weaves in real stories of him using the principles in the book.<br /><br />I have actually closed $21,425 in NEW business from this book and will continue to use Oren's lessons to make even more. I highly suggest you grab a copy. My video review of Pitch Anything is the first time that I have ever took the time and shot an Amazon video review before. It is the least that I can do for Oren putting together such a great product.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0071752854 Pitch Anything: An Innovative Method for Presenting, Persuading, and Winning the Deal]]

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Probably the best book I have read on the law of attraction, and that is saying a lot since I am partial to my own book on the same subject. I really liked how the author keeps science in an easy to understand format and how she gives simple manifesting exercises that really work. I went to look up what the author's ranking on Amazon and wasn't suprised to see this book is currently ranked #1 in many categories. I felt this book is good enough to be New Your Times Best Seller, if it isn't already.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is one of the absolute best mystery seek and find games that I've ever played!!! It's completely addictive and I don't want to stop playing until it's all done!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book written in the man's point of view.  As a woman, it was really nice to see what the man was thinking (even though the author is a woman) while getting \\"tangled\\" up in a relationship.  This was my type of humor all the way.  I was laughing in many parts of this book, routing for this guy who doesn't always deserve it to get the woman of his dreams.  It was a good love story and I will be looking for more books by this author.
B0035S996U|5.0|This is easily one of the best movies of the 1970s. Indeed, it could only have been made in the 1970s. Loosely based on the Anabasis of Xenophon, The Warriors follows the eponymous gang as they fight their way from the Bronx to Coney Island, after being accused of shooting Cyrus, president of the most powerful gang in New York. The gang is hounded by the likes of the Turnbull ACs, the Baseball Furies, and the Rogues, all colorful looks at an imagined urban underworld that again, could only have been inspired by the culture of the 1970s.<br /><br />Eminently quotable (&#34;Can... you... DIG IT!?&#34;), and a fun ride from beginning to end, The Warriors deserves its place as one of the great cult movies.
B0064W652A|5.0|Very awesome kept me off my seat the whole time,worth the money much read batman story. This story screams batman and I would recommend it to everyone.
B00BOA9MVI|5.0|Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down.. It was so much more than just about the incredible moment when the two enemies came together and that amazing act of chivalry occurred.<br />It is a book about the lives of two different pilots from two different sides that fate happened to bring together in the war torn skies over Germany on that fateful day.<br />It is also a book about what it was like to be a fighter ace in the Luftwaffe and fly with the Aces in the greatest fighter squadrons that the world has ever known. Franz Stigler was friends with and flew with all the great Luftwaffe Aces of World War Two and even taught many of them to fly when he was a pilot instructor earlier in the war.<br />The book also reveals the ethos of the Luftwaffe Fighter Pilots Chivalry Rules that was instilled into them from the beginning and remained with the &#34;Experten&#34; till the end.<br />The book finishes up with the Me262 debacle, the Fighter Pilot's Mutiny and the formation of JV44 and it's exploits and difficulties. It is a fantastic read in its own right as Franz is right in the thick of it. He and Galland were great friends, but I don't want to spoil too much as this book is so great.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is well written, full of action, has been well researched and you won't want to put it down. The only thing I found wrong was the author couldn't explain why Galland named his Squadron of &#34;Experts&#34; JV44, it was because if they were half as good as JV88 his Squadron in the Spanish Civil War they would be successful.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging but very intriguing.Great game. Lots of fun for everyone to try. Would highly recommend this to all all friends
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Its Just great! I get to share all the photos i create to facebook and twitter but the only reason i gave it four stars is because i cqnt share my photos to instagram which was upsetting but other then that this is a nice app :)!!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The new update has not been kind. I have had lots of issues with loading forecasts and it is defaulting to a location I am not in (I have only driven through that location).  I have uninstalled this app and now looking for a different weather app.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Great album from a talented guitarist. DVD was also well done.  He can still entertain with his music and his lyrics.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|i loved the movie and cd. it was great. i listen to it a lot. it was a great soundtrack
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The orchestra was incredible!!! I know people focus almost exclusively on the singers who are great by the way, but often times the instrumentalists who support and give character to the music are often overlooked or even ignored. Most people have little to no clue how long it takes for an instrumentalist to truly master their instrument to be able to perform like this, it takes years/decades.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This was a wonderful portrayal of Lincoln, I learned a great deal about the way the country was run during the film, more than I really wanted to know.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Narrated by the main character (the zombie) in a comical way that will connect to the awkward dweeb in any guy. And he's a zombie! How can that be bad?<br />I'm not going to go SO FAR as to call this a chick flick, but it kind of is, and I kind of liked it.<br />Even my younger sister (who's not a huge fan of zombie flicks) watched it twice.<br />If it's good enough for BOTH my sis and I, you've got to give it a try!<br />Oh yeah... and my mother, after watching the first 20 minutes said she \\"kinda liked it\\" which is a ringing endorsement coming from a woman who's picky about her movies, and would have never selected it on her own.<br />I'm just saying... even if you're dead, this one will warm your heart.
B0091REZMW|5.0|My daughter and I loves to play this game and it loads quickly and easily too! I like it because it can entertain her while on the road or waiting for an appointment!
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen is the wittiest novelist in the English language and the most observant of individual personal mannerisms.  No question
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is really fun and u should get it my friend showed me it and I said it looks really fun
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I have compared the weather forecast on my KINDLE, laptop, and Yahoo and find the Weather Channel to be more accurate.  This based on a few weeks so longer term might be more telling.

B005I3PAUO|3.0|To me personally this was an average Baldacci. Good entarteinment and value for money. The new protagonist, special agent Puller didn't become my favorite, at least yet.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Once again another excellent release by an awesome band. I've been listening to Saxon since 1984, some cd's may be better than others but all are good. The whole band sounds as fresh as ever. Excellent!
0525478817|5.0|I have literally read some parts of this book aloud to my friend and started crying because I remembered what Hazel went through and the way that Augustus says &#34;Hazel Grace.&#34; It's not my favourite book of all time, but it's up there because I really, really, really like it. It asks a lot of deep questions that makes me think and creates a narrative that I find myself engaging in.<br /><br />I really respect what John Green did in his book and I love the characters. The truths in this book on life and death are blunt but altogether very justified and beautiful.<br /><br />Loved the ideas. Loved the story. Loved the love. Loved Hazel Grace. Loved Augustus Waters. Loved their deep conversations. Loved the &#34;Okay&#34;s. Overall, loved this book and will continue to love it.

B004C0WVP6|3.0|So far this drive is working as expected. The &#34;Smart&#34; info for this drive makes me wonder if this is new or not.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book presented a fair simulation of responses from various countries to a major world crisis, based on their respective histories. No punches are pulled, resulting in a highly entertaining, masterfully constructed, patchwork narrative detailing different facets of the human perspective before, during, and after World War Z.
B00AMS38YU|5.0|A different story line with great acting.  A lot of action but not overdone.  Riding a bike in New York can be very dangerous.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|My daughter loves to play this game and it loads quickly and easily too! I like it because it can entertain her while on the road or waiting for an appointment!
B009VYF5E2|5.0|This Merlin has to be the best version I've ever seen.  The acting is superb and the special effects are perfectly placed.  I highly recommend the whole series.
B00AZMFO9U|4.0|I loved it, every real moment of this film.  My only objection, and it's a small one, is that is is too short a film.  I could have<br />been longer with a realistic final transformation of two of the main characters. That aspect of the film was not clear or<br />even believable. But opverall, what a small, diamond gem of a film.  The acting was brilliant, top to bottom. And Dustin<br />Hoffman's direction, was awesome throughout the whole film.  He is an actor who understands character; and it's<br />obvious, enjoys working with top acting talent to bring out the best in everyone. A film gem to delight audiences from<br />now to forever. Saw it twice and enjoyed it without reservation.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|I chose this product due to the overall design of the watch. It is a pleasure to wear and great durability, I have a watch about fifteen times the price and I enjoy wearing as much as this watch. A must buy!!!

B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I sat at the end of my seat watching this final season.  I know it had to end but only 5 years is too short.  The acting is great along with the special effects.  They brought you along with them to the end.  Hats off for a great series.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|The parcel was aimed at France. The reception was very fast. The game is excellent.<br />Only small problem for French people, it is necessary to create an US account PSN to be able to play (because the codes of download do not work otherwise).<br />Good game!!
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|This is not one movie. Is TWO movies.<br />The first half is extremely promising and exciting.<br />It looks that during production somebody came and alerted the director and writer that this was way too off beat. Let's make it more digestible and geared to mainstream. That happened exactly during the game's parking lot game scene. From there on, the movie becomes one common place after the other.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It makes you think but not too hard. It is so much fun. You want to keep going from floor to floor.
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you something that will keep you hooked, well this show is for you. The characters are fresh and writers are even better.

B009MO57H6|3.0|If you've seen and enjoyed the Resident Evil movies up to this point, you will probably enjoy Resident Evil: Retribution well enough. The story isn't much to speak of, but that's not what you're watching these movies for, is it? In a number of ways, Retribution is largely made up of elements and characters that you saw in previous movies, though with a slight twist. There are characters you thought were dead and plenty of set pieces that hearken back to earlier movies and if you can just allow yourself to enjoy the ride, you already pretty much know where you're going to end up. Not my favorite of the series, but it was still enjoyable enough for me to buy.
B00D37UQ1K|1.0|I think it only gets one star, but your rating system is unforgiving in the lower end of the scale.  I did not hate it; I just did not like it.<br />I LOVED THE BOOK and was so excited at the prospect of the movie, but the movie was extremely disappointing.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|I enjoyed the cast, the story, and structure of all the individual stories, and the acting. It's funny, heart-warming, touching, and upbeat.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Hey it's good get it. I did . And I think it's good. Go ahead get it. I dare you. You can see the weather.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|What a great movie fantastic acting great all round I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves a great story.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This film is acted excellently, the story is interesting, the screenplay is excellent and the pace is perfect. I enjoyed it very much.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Let's start with Gerard Butler who is gorgeous, mesmerizing, sensual, tantilizing, any thinking-woman's fantasy lover - and he can sing, too. Okay, take a deep breath. Never having seen him before, he was a revelation. The way he uses his voice and body language is a subtle seduction that stays with you long after the movie is over. And he makes the unmasked Phantom as sexy as the mysterious masked & caped Angel of Music. His raw intensity and tragic longing is sensational. (My husband says he's buying a cape - like that's all it would take? Oh, sweetheart.)<br /><br />Emmy Rossum as Christine has a lovely voice but lacks any true sensual appeal - sorry girl, but I don't know what he sees in you and how can you resist that bed! Patrick Wilson as the Viscount can also sing and act but, of course, he's no Phantom. Maybe they deserve each other - too bad they get to share one of the best love songs every written with \\"All I Ask of You.\\" The worst part of the movie is the role of Carlotta which is horribly overdone.She's soooo annoying and her scenes are much too long. Use those minutes to go get a snack.<br /><br />The directing is weak, there are just too many scenes with the opera singers and ballet dancers when all anyone really cares about is the romantic triangle. What was the director thinking in cutting constantly to flamingo dancers during the deeply sensual 'Point of No Return' number.(That will raise your temperature a degree of two.)<br /><br />Everyone knows the story so, suffice to say that the movie is very lush, with beautiful sets and costumes. The music, of course, is just wonderful.<br /><br />Have a girl's night in with your best friends and a couple of bottles of wine and let Gerard Butler \\"sing songs in your head\\". Any woman (of any age) who doesn't emit a moan during his wildly seductive \\"Music of the Night\\" needs serious help.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|Glad I didn't pay for it.  It consistently force closes on my HTC Thunderbolt.<br />Can't say more because I can't see how it actually plays.
B006R1T40I|5.0|If you like &#34;vintage&#34; Bonnie Raitt you will like this CD.  She still sings like she was 20 years old and pick great songs to cover.
B009IF7V2S|4.0|Some moments are laugh out loud funny. It's hard to go wrong with Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. I'm a fan of this film.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|One of the best Tower Defense games you can get on your device. The concept of the game is to not let the &quot;Blooms&quot; get passed your defenses ( aka your awesome monkeys ). Extremely addicting game with lots of content. You should get it.<br /><br />This has been a CAMERON GAMER REVIEWS.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am really enjoying this book series.  I like the detail about each character and what is happening with their part of the story.  I originally was interested in the series because it was compared to Lord of the Rings.
B0030IIYWA|4.0|Was fast, and in great shape, play well, my kids love toy story, Good price, it was boxed up good
B005544TRQ|5.0|Excellent script writing and series. Recommend without a doubt, it will hook you in and you'll have to catch up to the new season.
B001AQO400|3.0|Scarlett Johannson meets my expectations of a competent actor: She is able to leap from her own plebeian personality and transform herself into a literate, sensitive, beautiful young woman. Perhaps directorial magic is the only explanation. She left me enchanted.<br /><br />Murray, on the other hand, is the same boorish culturally-deficient zero that he undoubtedly is in real life. He does not act. He reads lines and takes stage direction. If he had not been a cult figure from Saturday Night Live, he could have been a Chevy salesman. Or a weatherman. Somehow, he has found his way from Punxsutawney to Tokyo. The character experiences the same culture shock in both locations, the same lack of affect, the same insensitivity. I would not want to sit at the same table with Bill Murray at a dinner party in real life. In movieland, his characters never transcend his personal limitations.<br /><br />The movie itself is very touching. The most tragic element is the interaction of the young married couple, who are so walled-off by their narcissism that their only communication is sexual. No wonder this literate sensitive woman feels alienated enough to be attracted to Bill Murray.<br /><br />This movie could have been much better. Imagine the leads as played by a young Maura Tierney and an elderly Will Smith.<br /><br />This movie could have been worse. Imagine the male lead played by Steven Seagall or William Shatner. Or Mel Gibson. Now add Drew Barrymore or Reese Witherspoon to the mix.<br /><br />Next year, I look forward to seeing Bill Murray as Gustav Mahler.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It was great.  I'm currently reading the second book which just takes you deeper into these peoples lives and the times they lived in.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Five more stars for Season two! Again,holds your interest all the way through the series! Great acting,very interesting characters! Can't wait to see season's 3 & 4!! Mr. Bates is my favorite!
1475143389|5.0|This is a very well written book on the truths of weight training. Everything in this book is insightful and fundemental knowledge of the weight training game. I agree with everything Mike Matthews has to say about training and I am excited to start his simple program and see some awesome gains! Mike is there to answer any questions for you once you've read the book and he will email you personally with advice if there's anything you don't understand. It doesn't really get any better than that. How many authors do you have emailing you once you've read their book? Check out [...] and see what else he has to offer!
0812992784|3.0|I wish an editor had taken out about half of this book, because it's very well written and has in it much food for thought.  However....It's irritating and distracting to have the author talk about himself in the third person.  It comes off sometimes as being detached and other times as arrogant.  I had the feeling that Rushdie kept a journal every day of the Fatwa and simply put every single boring detail of the journal in the book.  There's also a huge amount of tedious name-dropping.  On the other hand, I'm glad I plowed through those hundreds of pages, though I wouldn't do it again, just to know what it was like to live under such a threat.  Rushdie is a good writer, and has a sharp sense of humor, though I'm not sure most people would be that interested in the duller details such as where he went for dinner and with whom.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|No, I can't put it in the same league with West Wing, but how many shows are?  This move fast, has great humor, plots and characters, some of which you may have at first despised only to find yourself having a little affection for... Oh, and sexy too.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|i really like this game. although its been freezing up during certain tutorials. otherwise having lots of fun with it
B000W8HC8I|4.0|Very Easy read and Well worth it and looking forward to learning more about the life of Jordan Belfort. Recommend it!
B000093FLA|5.0|I don't know anyone who doesn't think this is a really good movie.  Enough twists and turns to keep you riveted.
B000005JA8|4.0|Trout Mask Replica is brilliant and misunderstood, much like the creator of this music, Captain Beefheart (aka Don Van Vliet). Don was a perfectionist and control freak, he had his vision and his bandmates had to follow it loyally.  Hats off to the Magic Band, the unsung heroes of this record.  They practiced exhaustively preparing for this record, and given the asymmetric sound it's difficult to fully appreciate the sacrifice they endured to help bring this record to life.  Pretty much Don is a narcissistic ass, and when you play this record it's easy to see he is in his own world.<br /><br />Trout Mask Replica is largely an inaccessible record, and only after repeated listens will you uncover the brilliant nuances.  Sounds that make you squint and question what the hell is happening will become endearing.  My favorite tracks are Moonlight on Vermont, Ella Guru, Ant Man Bee, The Blimp, and Dachau Blues.<br /><br />If new to Captain Beefheart I strongly encourage you listen to Safe As Milk before delving into this complex album.  Trout Mask is a 5 star album but I really don't enjoy it top to bottom, but I do respect it.  Occasionally I'll play some tracks but this isn't in heavy rotation.  Worth listening to for the musically weird and open minded.  It's certainly unlike anything else you've heard before.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This is a wonderful CD and also TV show.  I have purchased both CDs from the first season of the show and am looking forward to season two.  I highly recommended both the CD and the show.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|In full disclosure, I never really understood Shirley MacClaine's appeal.  Cute, but not beautiful.  Kooky but not that bright.  Good actress but not one of her performances, even in Terms of Endearment, really had me cheering for her, as she never really seemed that \\"present\\" in her roles.  Maybe she's just not present, period.  Maybe she's a clone from planet whatever?<br /><br />After reading her daughter's memoir, it's not much of a stretch to say she certainly wasn't present in her daughter's life.  No matter how Shirley MacClaine cuts it, there are some facts that are fairly easy to check.  Did she send her only daughter off to Japan at the age of two to live with a man who may or may not be her father?  She did.  Did she even get on the plane with her daughter to make sure her daughter arrived safely.  Apparently not.<br /><br />Did Shirley MacClaine ever fly to Japan to check on just how well her only child was being cared for?  Not unless she was there to film a movie.  Sachi was two.  TWO. Her mother put her on a plane to Japan by herself and went about her life.  This was not a mother who was facing life threatening surgery with no money.  This was a movie star.  Sayonara, Sachi.<br /><br />Even if every other story in Sachi Parker's incredible memoir were false, Shirley MacClaine comes off as an uncaring, narcissistic, vindictive and miserly bitch.  Although Sachi Parker makes no such claim  Shirley MacClaine had one priority: her. Money spent on anyone but her she resented.  Especially the money she spent to keep Sachi in Japan, then boarding school.  What kind of mother says to her only child after high school, especially a mother with millions of dollars:  \\"You're on your own\\" and makes her pay her back for a used car and refuses to pay for a college education?  Most baffling is:  since it is obvious that Shirley MacClaine had no interest in Sachi, had no interest in being a mother, why not just hire a couple who would care for her and love her and nurture her, or give her up for adoption? Why send her off to Japan?<br /><br />Shirley MacClaine's comments about this book were:  \\"It's almost totally fiction.  ... And written by my own daughter, for whom I have always wanted only the best.\\"  Oh, really?  Is that why you shipped her off to Japan at age 2 and, frankly, never took any motherly interest in her at all?  You \\"wished\\" her the best?  Maybe.  But what about actually DOING anything for her that was best?<br /><br />That Sachi Parker has come through what was one of the more miserable, lonely childhoods imaginable with a sense or humor and irony says that she got the best of what Shirley MacClaine had to offer - She certainly deserves something after the horror of a childhood she endured.
B004YCKK6Y|5.0|This is the kind of film where Tarantino excels.  All of the blockbusters that the critics pan, pay the bills so movies like this are possible.

B00CLD65X0|5.0|This show is a fabulous float through time. A window into life at a very dynamic period in history. And oh the drama...
B003G4W49C|4.0|Well, I figured I should read the book before the movie comes out, and I always heard the book was really good.  I'm not going to spend an immense amount of time writing this, other than to say, it was very competently done.  I don't feel it was a masterpiece, as I never really got emotionally invested in Ender.  I do think the stuff that is covered in regards to leadership is quite good.  I very much liked the ending- it was a surprise, and interesting turn of events.  I do think it was perhaps a bit to brief, though I understand there are other books in the series.  I will likely read the next one, to see how that plays out, to decide whether I want to continue further with Mr. Card's books...  I imagine in the movie, they have made all the actors significantly older, because there is no way some of the stuff that was done in the book would fly in a broadly released studio film.
0783225903|5.0|Brazil is the finest commentary on the intrusiveness of the state and creeping totalitarianism, that I have ever seen.  The inability of the state machine to take our protagonist's mind/soul is somewhat consoling, but not enough to completely distract us from the challenges confronting us.  Disturbing and inspirational at the same time.
B007NESBK2|5.0|This was purchased for my husband for Father's Day. He loves Sade and has the Soldier of Fortune CD. She hasn't lost her ability to connect with her audience.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Better than I had originally thought.  Never played the game but has grabbed my interest to possibly by an X-box system so I can experience the stories.  If not, at least I will read more of the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game. but I feel like the wait is to long to get stuff but u also have to say that since it is free its an awesome deal
B002ZG9846|5.0|There is a lot of foul language and over the top violence in this movie.  It is also a movie that has a plot that is in no way believable, so it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief.  So know up front, if you are one who hates those things in a movie, stay far away.  For everyone else, this is a movie that in part pays homage to the super hero movie and in part mocks it.  It has some dark comedic moments in it, but it is not really a movie that would be considered a comedy. The good guys are not necessarily all good but there are certainly clear good vs evil lines drawn.<br /><br />The story is simple.  I regular guy decides to become a superhero, operating out in broad daylight.  He discovers that he is in way over his head, and that there are other superheros of the more clandestine nature who are far better than him operating to bring down the local mob boss' empire.  So it ends up being part superhero movie, part revenge story, and part nerd gets the girl.  I think the acting, while certainly not academy award quality, was very good, with Chole Grace Moretz stealing the show as Hit Girl.  The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, and there are some good, yet pretty standard bonus material including making of behind the scenes material, a featurette on the comic and artwork.<br /><br />All in all, if the genre is in your wheelhouse, then you will probably enjoy the movie.  The bonus material is good, but not necessarily anything worth getting the discs vs the instant video unless you collect the physical discs.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I saw the Ender books several years ago, and made the mistake of thinking they were childrens (or perhaps adolescent) books. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed I would recommend young adults to read it too, but it is far from a childrens novel.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I am almost finished Season One (I just need to watch The Cage) and so far I think that it is a very entertaining series. I watch it every day.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Yes, we all know Han shoots first, but you won't know until you watch. A must have for any movie goer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. I love the characters, and there is always action. I recommend this book for teens and adults.

B003XF1OJK|4.0|Fills in a lot of details about the game. There are, of course, some differences between Game and Book narrative, but reading the book is worth it.
B00004YW6I|5.0|If you  have one P.J. Harvery record. this is the one to own.<br />Still a very independent lady, but more accesable here. Her material<br />on this Lp is put together better.

B009Y7YC2M|5.0|I own the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phablet and the Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet.  This app works extremely well on both devices!  After reading some of the other reviews, I can't help but wonder what went wrong for them.

For those who have experienced problems with this app, I recommend you send an email to the developers and they will assist you with your device.

B000WTTC94|2.0|So I can see why people just obsessed with VU have interest here.  However, I really think they got the original album sound right on 'Peel Slowly and See' and the subsequent CD's from that digital mastering. 'Sunday Morning' here sounds like a vinyl record with scratches (I'm sure some people like that, whatever floats you boat). So, don't buy this if you think you'll get the best sound and anyway, their albums were like early  'Yardbirds' albums, not known for Hi Fidelity. I admit that the 'scepter studio sessions' alternate takes sound a little more dangerous if you will, but the formal abum still stands as a masterpiece and I didn't notice the production sheen of it until I heard this.  For my tastes, scratchy sounding master tapes and acetates don't have a nostalgic or romantic appeal.  The factory rehearsals don't do much for me. If Velvet Undergound is your favorite band that ever existed then this would be worth your while I'm sure.  Oherwise this album has been remastered so many times with add ons, alternate tracks and so on many of which are cheaper and superior versions.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|love this app! probably the best app ever made! and you can connect to songcloud and get songs from there! again best app ever
B005WUHAX8|3.0|the case muffles the sound so talking to someone is kind of annoying making them repeat everything they say.<br />the case does not really protect the screen. i have had my screen crack with it on i got the screen replaced and then again it cracked. one thing i will say is that it is completely  water proof. i have taken it kayaking swimming and used it just for fun under water pictures not once has water gotten into the case.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I must admit I thought I wasn't going to like this book. There seemed to be a cast of new characters whom I knew too little about to invest in their fates. Outside of Katniss and Haymitch the returning characters seemed in rare form. Katniss' interactions with them were too rushed in my opinion. However, Suzanne Collins gets me  every time. As she slowly but steadily drove home her theme of survival through perseverance I began to reconnect with the storyline in which I fell in love. Despite the futuristic often wartime back drop this book was sweet ,endearing and contained just enough tension to keep up the excitement. It was the irony of all ironies that cut me though. Couldn't stop crying in the end. Good conclusion of this series!

B0079K4WMG|3.0|Set in Glasgow, \\"Perfect Sense\\" follows the story of a chef Michael (Ewan McGregor) and an epidemiologist Susan (Eva Green) falling in love with other just when a strange epidemic spreads all over the world, depriving the people of the sense of smell. Things don't stop there, but people are resilient, as the film's voiceover says, \\"life goes on.\\"<br /><br />This is a sci-fi romance with an unusual premise, or a modern-day parable beautifully-shot and well-acted, with a positive message about life, something that is also thought-provoking ... if you can ignore the film's pretentious and manipulative narrative.<br /><br />While director David Mackenzie manages to visualize the impending apocalypse effectively with minimum use of props, there is something artificial about the way the whole story is told. What if you lose your sense of smell? Pretty early on you will know where the film is trying to lead us to. \\"Perfect Sense\\" certainly does what it sets out to do confidently, even though I really don't care what is going on in this alternative universe of the emotionally distant film.<br /><br />Like some art house movies, \\"Perfect Sense\\" makes a point of showing what is obvious in a novel way.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The book \\"The Hunger Games was much better than the movie!  In the book we learn more about where Katniss comes from and what her motivations are.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written and comprelling. Interesting to see the prosecutor's point of view vs the defendant's. but when the narrator is on both side, yikes! makes for a very edge of your seat, type of novel. i really enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it.

0812984412|5.0|Is Cloud Atlas a good book or a great one?<br /><br />David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas is a behemoth, and it asks a lot out of its readers. To qualify, Cloud Atlas isn't an extraordinarily long novel - it's only a little over 500 pages - but its story spans across centuries, styles, genres, and characters. It's a book that is either revolutionary or gimmicky, based on whether you think its structure works. Cloud Atlas is divided into 6 novellas, each interrupting the preceding story so that the structure is that of a Russian nesting doll (stories inside one another). In the middle of the novel is nested the last (chronologically) story of the 6. After this story, the novel winds back down, finishing each interrupted story in reverse chronological order until the final pages dealing with the earliest story.<br /><br />Mitchell admits in much (through his character, Robert Frobisher, who composed a musical composition mirroring the structure of this novel) that his work could either be a work of genius or a tremendous folly: a revolution or a gimmick. After mulling the novel around in my head, I'm convinced that Cloud Atlas lies somewhere in the middle. I've thought more about this novel than any other in a long while. Its structure is both playful and daunting, and it asks a lot of the read to abruptly stop a story and move on without any sort of conclusion.<br /><br />If the 6 novellas of Cloud Atlas were published separately, or even in a normal anthologized fashion, I don't think that they would have received the amount of attention that they have. Each of these stories are good - they range from fair to very good, but never fantastic. It's hard to say that Cloud Atlas is better than the sum of its parts because there are just so many parts lying around, but because of its structure, it somehow becomes more than just six loosely connected stories.<br /><br />I've struggled with the question of whether or not Cloud Atlas is great literature, and more specifically, if it's something that will leave a lasting impression on the literary landscape. All great literature has something important to say, and Cloud Atlas does include themes and ideas that speak to the human condition, and what's important is that it does so by using its structure to make this point. Early in novel (in the second story), Robert Frobisher writes that \\"a half-finished book is a half-finished love affair.\\" It's an easy statement to make but one more difficult to prove within the context of a book. Mitchell is able to prove Frobisher's point by interrupting 5 of the stories in Cloud Atlas. When these stories' threads pick back up (i.e., in the latter half of the book when readers are able to read the conclusion to one of the 5 novellas), there's a great sense of relief and comfort.<br /><br />### Some slight spoilers ahead ###<br /><br />The structure of Cloud Atlas also allows for the readers to see pre-established settings in a new context. When readers witness the slavery and cannibalism in the earliest story, it is a gross taboo. These indecencies to humanity feel like bizarre, disgusting acts that are in no way normal to human nature. By the final pages of the novel, however, these same acts feel less bizarre, and in many ways part of the human experience. Cannibalism takes place in Sonmi's story, in Zachry's story, and in Ewing's. Slavery, captivity, and the fight for freedom of some sort also takes place in every story. Human behavior guided by war (or the threats of war) takes place in every story. These motifs aren't always readily apparent, but because readers go through each time period before finishing a story, perspectives change upon returning to the last half of each story. If the structure of Cloud Atlas were that of a traditional collection of novellas, the reader would miss out on some of these motifs. No doubt after reading some of these stories, readers would pick up on the recurring themes of freedom and warfare, but the nested structure of Cloud Atlas allows the reader to notice and rediscover these ideas in real time.<br /><br />The idea that human struggles never change is emphasized not only by the structure of Cloud Atlas but also by its style. The six protagonists of the novel all have very different backgrounds, settings, philosophies, and motivations, and each of them appear in a story that is told in a different way. These differences are enhanced by the varieties of styles, languages, and genres that are used throughout the novel. Each story is incredibly different from the next. What links these stories is the above mentioned themes and ideas. These themes are presented implicitly as constants in human nature, and the fact that they are apparent for not only a lawyer on a galleon in 1849, but for an elderly book editor trapped in a retirement home in 2012, or a human clone in North Korea over 100 years from now, only emphasizes how constant these things actually are.<br /><br />The problem with Mitchell's structure of Cloud Atlas is that the first half of the novel is just a fairly good one. The last half is a great one. Not only are readers able to requite with their unrequired love affairs, but they are also able to draw the connections between the stories. Up until the middle of Cloud Atlas, the stories are featured as being distinctly from one another. As each story closes, it becomes apparent that these stories really weren't so different from one another at all.<br /><br />While I have no doubt that some readers will believe Cloud Atlas to be a gimmicky pretentious mess, I think Mitchell does more than prove that to tell the story that he wanted to tell, he needed to tell it in this nested structure. By the end of the book, what was a gimmick becomes a necessity. Telling Cloud Atlas in chronological order would break it or render it ineffective; it would turn a great book into a moderately good one. At its best, Cloud Atlas tears down the convention of storytelling and shows that any and everything is possible in literature.f Cloud Atlas allows the reader to notice and rediscover these ideas in real time.<br /><br />The idea that human struggles never change is emphasized not only by the structure of Cloud Atlas but also by its style.

B008NABUU8|3.0|This is not my favorite, although i do see its appeal to others.  You don't receive enough credits to make enough bridges for free, so you would really have to be into this game or want to purchase extras in order to enjoy it.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|First off, I'd just like to complain about the cover of this book. It is totally misleading, and makes you think you're going to read a silly, little \\"oops, we got married\\" story. For someone who is pretty tired of the marriage of convenience plot and wishes it would be banned from all future romance novels, I have to say I enjoyed this book--for the most part.<br /><br />It was an interesting twist that the gal couldn't remember why she had agreed to get married after just meeting the guy. And that he had to convince her that she should stay with him was something new, but there was something unbelievable about his character. I can buy that he doesn't expect romantic love to happen since he's never fallen in love before, but weird that he absolutely doesn't have a plan in case it does. And weirder, that in the midst of his marriage to the perfect girl--a marriage that he hopes will produce children and last forever--when he suspects that she is falling in love with him, he pulls back. I think that was just dumb--no matter what his background was to make him give up on love.<br /><br />As is typical with many romances, there's really not much story here beyond the relationship--we don't even know what he does for a living--but the relationship story was interesting enough to keep me reading.<br /><br />Sometimes, the writing itself distracted from the story. I had to go back and reread to figure out what the writer was trying to say with what they must have thought was an interesting turn of phrase, but just ended up being confusing.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Wonderfully put together superhero movie. It's all about the Hulk in this one, the other superheroes are GREAT too, but the Hulk is just BAD! The villan Loki is probably one of the best bad guys I've seen in a while. Buy it and enjoy

0670026557|4.0|As a retired person, I wasn't much interested in the practical advice related to negotiating the career path, but I found the basic distinctions between giving (no strings attached!), negotiating or trading, and taking fascinating.  A lot of what I've called and done as giving was really just tit for tat.  Real giving with no expectations is what is powerful.  So, though all the details about studies and work cases were not all that interesting to me, I got a great deal from the main ideas.

B002QP145C|3.0|I would like to have learned a little more history about the war rather than the blood and the killing.  I know a lot of the history of the war.  You do yourself a disservice showing the blood and guts of that war and not what real Finns went through.  Google a movie called &#34;Fire and Ice&#34;, produced and directed by a man named, Ben Straut, out of Indianapolis, IN, a tv station.  You will aprreciate more so from this movie as to what the Finns had to endure.  How the Finns endured is called, &#34;sisu&#34; and there's only one place that comes from and that is God.  Watch the movie, they maintained a &#34;free&#34; Finland, that's, &#34;sisu&#34;, what American-Finns call freedom.

B0013WJGJ0|5.0|Tim Burton's Batman balances the Batman saga with wonderful drama, dark tones, and just enough camp to make it feel like a Batman film. Each scene is stolen in this original by a wonderful turn as Joker, by Jack Nicholson. Michael Keaton shines as the original Batman. The sets, the lighting, and the mood of Tim Burton and create a world for Batman like no other film has.<br /><br />The stage set here for probably the best Batman of the whole bunch, Batman returns, Tim Burton last Batman film.

0553577123|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book.  This version of her diary, as opposed to the most common one that's out, makes her sound just like the child she was at that time.  You see Anne more frankly.  I've read both versions.. In the one you see most often, she almost sounds mature, VERY mature for someone so young.  No ..young thoughts...  It was edited.  This version has entries previously withheld during first publication...  This one, you can SEE she's a kid, doing and thinking what kids do and think.  It's wonderful!

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Nalini Singh is one author that I know is not going to disappoint.  I constantly find myself  eagerly awaiting her next release as soon as I read the last paragraph of each book.  The best thing ever? Her characters are not suffering from high school angst or drama that so many other authors of this genre seem to be churning out. There is always an actual plot instead of pages of continuous sexual activities with male characters that apparently have a ten second recovery time between acts.<br /><br />Kaleb caught my attention several books past and his story surpassed my every expectation.

B0048WQDIE|1.0|This humor did not age well. I should have read this as a kid, but now I can't get through a page without thinking this writer has the same style as a guy who has been fired from about 20 modern failed sitcoms before penning this book. Not only could this book have benefited from the use of the &#34;return&#34; key to create some paragraphs every once in a while, but I think it should come with a companion laugh track to complete the groan-inducing experience.

B00BU2VSNU|5.0|I've listened to ELO since I was ten and I think Jeff Lynne's produced one of the finest catalogs of work in pop/rock/prog.  He's written some great serious music; but I've always enjoyed his fun stuff better (Think \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" as opposed to \\"Evil Woman\\").  He has a great talent to make a song light hearted without being cloyingly over the top (I'm looking at YOU, Bobby McFerrin!). I was happy to find that this album is a nice collection of breezy, fun music. There are a couple of serious songs; but for the most part this is an album that will bear hug you with its infectious singablility.  It's humanly impossible NOT to sing the background lyrics to \\"Don't Let Go.\\"

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Skyfall didn't dissapoint. Although tamed a bit down for PG-13 it lacked a bit of the historical suggestiveness but the action and story line were 007 worthy. Enjoyed very much and have been a big fan since the early days.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My only complaint about the game is that there are only ten levels. I hope they get more of them made because it's actually challenging and yet doable. I'll confess to getting stuck once or twice, but overall, it's a nice game...and since it's free, I can't really complain too much about the shortness of it.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I got this movie for my kids to watch, they have heard people quote the movie and now they have seen it. They actually loved the movie and want to see more from our &#34;flashback&#34; time.
B00447L4JG|4.0|I just wanted to see the jim carrey role in which he played but thought it was okay or so so.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love this game but it took for ever to load to play the game but I still like it
1433502410|5.0|While many churches want to stick with the KJV of the Bible, I understand this version is a direct translation of the Greek and Hebrew also, but written in modern language, while keeping completely accurate interpretations.  The flow is excellent and I have yet to scratch my head at a study note like I do most versions.  This one makes sense like no other version I've had and I have MANY!
B000SW16M6|5.0|I loved the movie unfortunately when I purchased this movie I was thinking it was another Tom Cruise movie so my kids and my grandparents got to watch something that they probably should not have.
B003AWRM9W|3.0|I just wanted to see the jim carrey role in which he played but thought it was okay or so so.
0143122916|4.0|This book was powerful, angering, and eye-opening. I was not previously aware of North Korea's prisoner camps, and especially not that they've been around for 50+ years. I also didn't understand just how impoverished North Korea really is, especially as a whole (e.g., rice is a luxury even for the rich, and no one has reliable electricity), or how many people have defected from the country over the years.<br /><br />I was amazed at the differences (which made a lot of sense, but to which I'd never given any thought) between people raised in the outside world and then imprisoned, and people born and raised inside prison camps. If that's all you've known and all you've learned to adapt to, it's incredible the way captors can shape you. I can't even fully comprehend it.<br /><br />I would have liked to have read more about how Shin feels, how he's adapted more recently from being an emotional and psychological prisoner with post-traumatic stress disorder to being able to speak to large crowds about his experiences; but at the same time, I almost felt guilty and helpless reading about his experiences without really knowing what to do to help. Along those lines, I wish there had been more information at the end of the book about how to help the organizations that aid North Korea refugees.<br /><br />This book is straight-forward and easy to read. I would recommend it to anyone probably high school and older. The events depicted need to be better publicized.
1856697525|5.0|Great book and great inspiration from a great talent, Put this book on your shelves and not forget to read it
B0081336FO|5.0|This series is excellent in many ways, but my favorite part of the series is the interaction between Sherlock and John.  Cumberbatch and Freeman portray these two men, who are equals though not in the same areas, and their friendship.  It's this friendship that keeps the show interesting.
B004SEUIWY|3.0|I'd hoped for a decent use of Heath Ledger and Matt Damon's talent. I was sorely disappointed. Great concept, bad execution.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie was every bit as beautiful,  visually and in narrative, as the previews made it out to be. Even beyond that.  This is now, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies.<br /><br />I have not read the book, and in all honesty I may not now that I've seen the movie and know how it ends.  However, it must be an amazing story to read, judging by how beautiful and detailed the movie is.  It was a much deeper and much more serious story than I expected based on seeing the trailers, and the most fanciful story on a generally religious subject I've ever seen. It's culturally, philosophically, and religiously interesting, and I really want to see it again.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|love all the seasons wish there were more than 5. I watched all seasons one after another I like how the seasons ended.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|An unlikely victim, a fading way-of-life in an exotic setting, overlaid with the looming terror of imminent Japanese occupation, and a tenaciously persistently indignant parent - how cld this go wrong?<br /><br />well, it sags a little in places and the premises/ending don't completely satisfy but the book is a good read. i recommend it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Well acted and great, warm-hearted story! Lovers of period piece stories will love watching this.  Actors are enchanting!  Must see!
B008Q0AJA2|3.0|When this movie first came out it had high ratings because of its originality.  But after watching it most recently, it was a little boring.  There are many movies I enjoy watching over and over again, but that's not the case with The Truman Show.
B003GXJ072|5.0|Love the series.  Except for maybe Alien Resurrection.  Sorry.  Even if you're not a big sci-fi fan the action and gore will get ya!
B00821OX98|4.0|Very good show....I highly recommend this show.  It is very entertaining and keeps your interested throughout each episodes.  all i can is the you will enjoy this shoe..
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I enjoyed this series very much. There have been so many depcitions of Merlin over the years both in print and film but this was refreshing and fun and I really enjoyed it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I truly enjoy playing this card game.  It provides great entertainment.  A must have.  Once you start playing this game you will not be able to stop.
B0060D0R2C|5.0|I watch this movie over and over.  I like it in the background while cleaning house. You cant beat Denzel and Val Kilmer and I love Paula Patton.  And to top it off it takes place in New Orleans, one of my favorite cities.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love this app. It would so well and is user friendly. I would recommend it to family and friends. This app is very accurate.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|This is not the children's fairy tale. It has some pretty gruesome scenes. I even had to look away a few times and I am a devout Steven King fan....but this story was graphic. Please don't let any child see this. I wouldn't even want a teenager to see it. So my recommendation is no one under 17 years and then they must have a strong stomach and not be prone to nightmares.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love how this game can involve finger and device movement, but it needs to respond faster in some areas on levels. It is great for free time, and can be a quick game when you don't have much time on your hands. I love it, and the minions too :P!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome!!!!!! I wish there were more games... that r just like this game please add more games
B00314VYNE|5.0|It really looks like the toy from the movie. I thought that it WAS the toy, lol.<br /><br />Remembered me of my times as a kid that this would be quite something to go with the Sheriff Woody.<br /><br />Great finishing, great product overall and quality materials. It's not something cheap.<br /><br />Definitely go for it
B008K9SG9K|5.0|So I was hesitate about this in the first place. But I decided to get it because I loved  Radioactive and their live performance of it on YouTube. At first when i listened to the whole album I liked it . I was a bit disappointed but I liked it . Then i listened to it again and again and again. Now I love it . So I recommend to buy this album and let it grow on you.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|This book is very interesting and fascinating depending on how you see the Western frontier from the 1700. This includes many of the problems that would be faced by the people working on the ranches and social problem that women and men faced altogether. This book is recommended for people interested in knowing how things were getting in the Western frontier around the 1700s
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I really enjoy the way Rollins mixes science with a strong fictional novel.  With each new novel, Rollins moves to a new height, involving the reader to a great adventure!  I highly recommend this novel.  I do hope to see this novel on the big screen someday.  It would be a captivating movie!
B004AFFZNI|4.0|OEM quality as any GoPro product with good built quality. Comes on the original GoPro packaging with the screw and everything to place your camera inside. Have fun.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This movie is well cast the concept is unique and stimulating, the cinematography is so vivid and seamless. These are the technical side of the industry that is met by many other films but when you watch this it's like watching something that Salvador Dali would have created so that each time you watch it, it comes at you from a different angle. It might be a &#34;LOVE IT or HATE IT&#34; movie but I love it. I sincerely hope you do to.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My daughter began playing this on the Ipad at our Dentist's office and loved it! I downloaded it to my Kindle and she never stopped playing it the entire two weeks she was visiting.  She was always describing the new dragons she was hatching and how she was expanding her lair.  Great entertainment!
B004NOH9LW|4.0|Another brilliant Matt Damon performance in a story that features him as a guy suffering the &#34;curse&#34; of the &#34;gift&#34; of psychic abilities. His measured display of loneliness and quiet desperation that paradoxically results from his ability resonates throughout.  As does his interfacing with the lives of others at the aforementioned cost to his own happiness ... until he crosses paths with a lovely French woman who has seen &#34;the other side&#34; through a near death experience.  And by the way, that lovely French woman (Cecille DeFrance?) is immensely appealing, and very effective as a woman whose life is turned upside down because others are uncomfortable with her sudden sureness about one's fate after death. I give the movie 4 stars - but could easily be persuaded to up that to 5.....<br /><br />My one complaint? I purchased a top of the line DVD via Amazon - but the product was far from full screen (&#34;letterbox&#34; I believe is the term) and the volume capacity would challenge an owl. My wife and I endured those inconveniences, though, and are glad we did.......
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I ordered this movie classic for my teenage daughter and she added it to her Disney collection. She loves it, I also watched it with her once, it's been about 30 years since I've seen it.
B008Y1YFNU|2.0|Papa Roach is not a bad band at all, but I felt like this album wasn't so good. However, there were a couple songs that I did like on this album (Walking Dead, Give Me Back My Life, Before I Die, What's Left Of Me, and Breathe You In). I felt like Jacoby Shaddix was screaming in songs that didn't sound like they should have screaming in. A loved track \\"What's Left Of Me\\" would be awesome to the core without his annoying screaming in the bridge. Other songs that felt like rather \\"Hard Rock\\" than \\"Alternative Metal\\" but actually aren't that way include \\"Wish You Never Met Me\\", a song that is melodically awesome but messed up with Shaddix's screaming, \\"Not That Beautiful\\", the worst song on here, another song messed up with Shaddix's screaming  AND a bad usage of the GD word, and \\"Give Me Back My Life\\", which actually has the normal screaming method in the alternative metal scene, and isn't so bad of a case of screaming. Jacoby Shaddix is NOT bad, he is a very great frontman, musician, and many other things. He is also funny on YouTube in Papa Roach's funny moments. But if you listen to Papa Roach, consider listening to an album like \\"Getting Away With Murder\\", which also has songs with unnecessary screaming but the pain doesn't seek in there too much.
B0084IRVFC|5.0|Item received as listed. Fast shipper! My boss swears by this book, every new employee must read it, so we were thrilled to receive the book in such good condition.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So happy to find Downton on Amazon. I love the show, the characters and the story lines of the show.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|This is a wonderful movie-the computer animation is fabulous as well as the story. I'm a BIG fan of owls and am delighted to finally own a copy of it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once I got going I couldn't stop. At first it seemed too simple and I almost stopped playing, but once it became more challenging I just couldn't quit..
0618871713|5.0|This is a book that grabs you and surprises you, constantly. How much could you expect from a book called Fun Home that's a graphic novel? And how crazy would you expect a memoir to be?<br />Well, it's pretty darn crazy.<br /><br />I can't say that I agree with the Alison Bechdel (the author) on everything she says in this book, all of the announcements and beliefs about her father and her family, but it's an amazing look into her mind, psychologically speaking, as well as an amazing literary work.<br /><br />If you're looking for a light read, this isn't for you. This is very heavy. My entire book is filled with annotations and marks because I felt the need to just write my responses all over it.<br />It's not for the conservative, I'm assuming, but I wouldn't know, maybe they &#34;should read it&#34; or something.<br /><br />It's a book that would be forever branded in my brain, that's for sure.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The book was very well written. It is an interesting story about the bonds of family. It doesn't have the shocks that are in the previous books, but still an interesting read that held my interest all the way through.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|The movie: I avoided this when it came out in theaters.  It just looked dumb.  Finally saw it so that I could see DM2 in theaters this summer.  It was, surprisingly, very good, as was DM2 - laugh-out-loud funny and adorable.<br /><br />Amazon instant video:  Again, a pleasantly surprising, excellent experience.  Dare I say it....better than Netflix!  Very crisp and clear, with no blips, over wifi thru Roku to TV.  Will definitely do it again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book... hAted the ending....<br />This book was a great mystery.  Was caught off guar by the ending.  Wow..
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I haven't figured it our yet . I get to a place and the car won't go go any further. I will\<br />get my grand son to help me, It seems like fun when I can know how the game works.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed it<br />Made me think as some were tricky but not to hard<br />I would recommend it to someone who was looking for a challenge<br />Wish it had a notebook or something to take notes so I didn't have to go back and forth and redo things
B001P7HUF0|4.0|Very good and entertaining movie.  Different than what I expected, but still good. Language fairly clean and good mix of humor and serious scenes
B009NY43NY|1.0|The writing was horrible.  The characters were inconsistent from previous books.  The plot was garbled and non-believable.  The whole book just seemed like the writer was tired of it and was just slapping down any old words to hurry up and get it finished.  Do NOT waste your money!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Speechless so inspiring<br />I really feel I have learned a lot and I can't wait to start improving my relationship
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Simple to assemble and use. I found that laying it down on a flat surface and turning the bottle around gives the most precise cuts. Cool product.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Quotes<br />Characters<br />There is a lot to like about this film. A must for anyone who lived through the 90s.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My five year old daughter select this game from the app store,  she loves it. Now her brother and cousins are playing it. Great game she really enjoys.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I haven't played Magic in years.  But when this game out I figured what the heck let's give it a try. It's been a blast. This game is well worth the ten bucks it cost to get the full version.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|I saw this movie at the local cinema and immediately I knew I wanted to own the DVD when it was available.<br />I hated the kid at first but ended up sharing his pain and emotional torment.  This movie is a must see especially for New Yorkers.<br /><br />J.B.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|SO GLAD THIS IN AMAZON I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE DALLAS AND KNOTS LANDING AND FALCON CREST, DYNASTY ON PRIME THOSE WERE MY FAVORITE SHOWS.  ALSO RICH MAN POOR MAN WOULD BE NICE.  FINALLY SOMETHING TO WATCH ON TV NOTHING LIKE THE OLD FAVORITES.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a great series. Hated to see it end. You become friends with the characters.  Sad to say goodbye.
0307386171|3.0|ON CHESIL BEACH is very English. That was my first thought. It's also quite sad, although, here and there, almost unintentionally funny. The story concerns, mostly, a single day, and only part of the day, at that. It's the honeymoon afternoon, evening and night of Florence and Edward, who think themselves to be so very much in love. But Florence finds the sex act repulsive to the point of being unbearable. This is a story about class and education, but most of all about a total lack of communication, rife with mixed and missed signals and tragic misunderstandings, between a man and a woman. It's about ignorance and heartbreak. One thinks of the sixties as a time of sexual freedom and enjoyment. Not so with poor Ed and Flo; they were just a bit too early, War Babies, not Boomers, and uptight British ones at that.<br /><br />I know the author has had many bestsellers. I tried once to read ATONEMENT, but never finished it. This book I made it through, despite its dreariness and sad subject. But then it's barely two hundred short pages. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it or not. I need to think on it. (Which is probably not much of a recommendation.)<br /><br />- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Fans of the Broadway musical should enjoy this film adaptation by Joel Schumacher.  This re-imagining of the classic story pays homage to all of the beautiful songs written/composed by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart.  Even though the original cast of the Broadway show aren't included in this version, the viewer will find satisfaction in the performers (Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Miranda Richardson, Minnie Driver, and Patrick Wilson) that are featured here.  While most of the award-winning songs such as Music of the Night, All I Ask of You, Phantom of the Opera, Angel of Music, Point of No Return, Think of Me, etc. are very much included, the Broadway viewer may find a little disappointment in the re-written parts of the screenplay.  While in the show most of the story is sung through, this version cuts out a lot of the sung-through dialogue and replaces it with re-written lines.  While some of the show may be lost there, overall the film still shines as a classic even after its first release in 2004.  This is a must-have for any fan of the Great White Way or the musical!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I completely enjoyed this series (so far)! The world Cassandra Clair has created is so easy to get caught up in. I read one book right after the other and was sad when it was over.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|If you liked the Sean Penn movie about the guy in an institution who complained, &#34;I hate this place!  Nothing works in here!&#34; then this is a tour de force!  I watched it with an older female that's had a life long substance abuse problem and she thought it was superb!  So I guess it depends on your perspective.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I had just gotten done reading a bunch of fiction books and was looking for a more real story. This was a good filler for what I was looking for. A sweet touching story of a boy born with horrible deformities and trying to find his place in the world... how his parents feel, his sister... how other people deal with him. A warming story.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|It's not worth it to pay for a game I beat in two hours. All the puzzles and mysteries were great though.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I love it it is the cutist talking cat app that i have seen and im an adult and have fun talking to it lol
B0064MGU98|4.0|Is very realistic I love it.<br /><br />Thank you for letting .me watch the episodes Great stuff. I am looking forward to the next episode
0545586178|4.0|The great thing about the sequel is raising the stakes - it's not about the game anymore, it's something bigger! But the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale never quite convinced me, since it happens mostly inside Katniss head and not as a fruit of the situations involving she and the guys - there's a kiss here and there, but that's it.<br /><br /> But as a whole it's definitelly recommended!! Great entertainment.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|It didnt even work ...I turns it on...and it didnt download once I got it on my tablet ...it got stuck at 62 per cent ...this is stupid...FAIL!!!!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Of course this book is awesome. If you liked the first, you will obviously like the second. But pay attention!! It is hard to keep track of who is who and what side they are on. Sometimes it is difficult to read but that is part of the fun right??? looking up words?<br /><br />Regardless, these books are amazing.
B005M5OSBK|5.0|This is a great CD!  Pink Martini is one of our favorite groups and 'A Retrospective' is a wonderful collection on some of their best music.
B0070DOHQS|3.0|I have tried Jump Desktop on multiple Windows computers and have found that it doesn't work with Windows 8 Pro. It does connect to it but doesn't stream the display correctly. Also the whole domain, username, and password deal with Windows RDP Connections are very confusing. I was able to connect to a Windows 7 Starter successfully and was very impressed by that.<br /><br />So if your thinking to connect to a Windows 8 computer, download Splash Desktop instead.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|No words for how amazing this book is. But this is a review so I suppose words are mandatory. Treachery, deceit, happiness, sadness. This book has everything.<br /><br />Yes it is a difficult read and yes it is hard to keep up but WOW is it worth it.<br /><br />Martin just has a way of writing that sucks you in. And you never know which character story you are going to get next. Just. Flawless. love it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Once you start watching, you want to see more.  Great series, with a great variety of topics.  Very intriguing characters, well played.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|This is a pretty decent document editing app. You can type up Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Documents. The option to sync files wirelessly from your computer is also cool. The only flaw I see is the inability of the app to connect to SkyDrive, Dropbox, and other major cloud servers. Overall it is a good app, but I would instead recommended OfficeSuite Professional 7.
B00AO686MY|5.0|The funniest bunny since Buggs. Already a classic.  Don't miss the extras showing how the amazing special effects were achieved.
006092988X|5.0|I was surprised at how a book written at the turn of the century was so frank about the lives of the characters. Great story and strong women!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app has the most accurate weather prediction of all. It is almost always correct with its predictions. And the new update only makes checking the weather cooler.<br /><br />Very highly recommended by me.
B000002JOF|5.0|Take any of the reasons you like Chris Rea's music and you will find it in this cd.  This is his &#34;my music&#34; offering.  He sneaks in his sometimes critical social comment on the way things are, like he does in &#34;Tell Me There's a Heaven&#34;, but mostly he just lets it all hang out, like he does in &#34;Texas&#34;.  He loves to make that guitar do his talking for him and he speaks volumes.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Fast, easy read.  Was looking forward to reading this 2nd book after Bared to you. Read in one day but was left hanging. No third book to look for or pre purchase. Only an author's note that the story wasn't finished yet...so frustrating! However I will buy the third book to the second it's released
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|This is a very fun and addictive tower defense game based on the hit online version of the game. The game is very fun and I highly recommend this game.
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|I thought a broader view of the world would be OK but really there was too much domestic stuff for the US and UK for me to keep my interest. After the couple of headline &#34;World News&#34; stories I was looking for local stuff.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not up to The Kite Runner or the Thousand Suns.  The Kite Runner showed how the fragile prosperity and stability of Afghanistan society was wrecked by invasion and the wreckage left prone to takeover by an intolerant group.  Lots of penetrating perceptions of character though.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Understand. My lesson, if I can not install the  I will never play the game ever again. I am ever unhappy.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|The graphics were great, it looked like it would probably be fun but.....<br />A prerequisite to having this is a love of horses, I only like em a little
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My husband had mentioned that we needed a cleaning tool simalar to the Clean Master. I was surfing the channels and stopped on QVC which  was promotion the Clean Master. I immediately<br />picked the phone up to order the Clean Master.<br />Upon arrival I pulled out of the box put to work  The Clean Master has met my expectations and beyond. I would recommend  the Clean. Master to any one.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|pretty cool it keeps me entertained for a long period of time unlike some games ive played I can play this for hours and jot get tired of it definately rate this a 5 out of 5
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|One of those games you can spend hours using without ever worrying too much about conquering it.<br />Its free though and it's better than some of the games I have paid for.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Initially, this movie seemed to have so much promise-- an exploration into Clark's childhood, his feelings of being an outsider while growing up and wandering the world in search of himself-- but in the end, there are not enough of these asides to sustain the movie before it simply lapses into a showcase of explosions and indestructible people fighting each other (why not have 30 min of people hitting each other with foam rubber hammers--same thing).  While it is probably possible to make a dramatic and compelling scene with Pa Kent and Clark agonizing over how/if he should use his abilities or if maintaining his secret identity is more important--I can't see either of them entertaining for one minute that a school bus load of kids should die rather than Clark saving them--sorry-- that is not true to who the characters are.  Similarly, in every other incarnation of Superman, Clark probably would have found a way to save his father rather than standing by and letting a tornado sweep him away into oblivion.  This just doesn't ring true.  While there was an obvious effort to give this movie emotional depth and complexity, overall it could not overcome the flatness that often comes with the Superman character-- Unlike, say, the Avengers or Iron Man-- there is virtually no humor in this movie, no personal revelations/development that compare to Tony Stark's transformation, no twists & turns with the villain as intriguing as with Loki or the Mandarin--and, overall, not enough human moments that remind us of who we are and the world we live in.  What made Superman a hero in this was his killing General Zod-- so that the movie could finally END.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love that it's updated with right things it's something I would recommend to everyone it's just amazing........Good...better ...best...never let this rest
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Does what it's supposed to well enough. Pretty much like all other Android Facebooks apps that I have used so far.
B003B96AOW|4.0|If you are a collector there are no worries.  You're not going to open it.  It's perfect read no further.  But if you are buying for someone to play with...<br /><br />I bought this for my son.  I didn't realize how hard it is to find a good dead pool for him so I chose this one.  Here are my ratings and why...<br /><br />Looks: 10 no need to ramble about that.<br /><br />Movement: 8.<br />He can do everything my son needs except take a sitting position and full split.  My lil man wants him to do what he sees him do on tv.<br /><br />Durability: 8<br />My son plaaays with his toys.  Dead pool has been down the sliding board alot and so far no paint has come off.  However the two knives that are on his left leg and chest handles have broken off.<br /><br />Durabilty weapons:  7<br />The swords that he comes with handles have broken off.  Son had them in the sheath on DP's back and dropped DP and the handles were gone.<br /><br />Fun factor: 10<br />I don't know what Dead Pool being my son's favorite character says about me as a father (super fun, super awesome, super dad) but he loves this toy.  He beats up superman with him, brags cause Deap Pool can't die, and bang bang... bang bang bangs everything in site With DP's pistols in hand.  My wife hates it but this one is still a keeper and worth buying in my opinion.  So go get you a chimichanga, take a bite and buy iiiiit!
0871164566|5.0|This is a great visual inspiration book! Not only do you learn how to make these but Kimberly also shares some embellishment ideas for the designs. I look forward to creating several of her designs.
B008JFUR10|4.0|Effects. Effects. Effects.  That's why you wanted to see this movie.  NOT for a good story!  This is live-action anime.  If I hear one more fool (who thinks he's a deep thinker) criticize the story while overlooking the action I'm going to lose it.  You can't sound smart if your critique of the story suggests this movie is \\"bad.\\"<br /><br />This is one of those movies that gets your over-critical friends saying \\"it just looks like a big blob of CGI.\\"  Sure, the scale of this summer blockbuster-style film is TREMENDOUS.  But, unlike the Transformers sequels, it doesn't get away from itself.  No.  We still find some Guillermo del Toroisms, especially in creature-creation and preternatural market senes.  The story, on the other hand, is quite simple. It strikes me as something out of a videogame or a futuristic Dungeons & Dragons adventure.  It's no Troy (2004).  Troy was an epic-scale war story that--among some AMAZING action sequences--still allowed its viewers to intimately understand the characters.  Rim is less (successfully) character-driven.  A few things are revealed about the characters, but they don't seem to \\"develop.\\"  But why was this movie made, how was it marketed and who was it made to please?  Probably not a bunch of stuck up plot critics.  No, this was made for sci-fi effects and action junkies.  So, if you're not willing to check your critic's hat at the door, then I suggest you just shut up and wait for the next giant monster fight when you go see this.<br /><br />Through some manner of portal between tectonic plates deep below the Pacific Ocean emerge giant behemoths called Kaiju.  These creatures come all shapes and plus-sizes.<br /><br />There's your movie.  If you need great writing to accompany this, then shame on you.<br /><br />To save humanity all of the world powers set aside their differences to pool their finances and engineer Jaegers, giant robots jockeyed by paired, mind-melded (aka, drifting) pilots.  All seems to be fine--given that we are under attack by 600 foot tall abominations--until the Kaiju start winning!  Though simple behemoths at first, subsequently emerging Kaiju are bigger, smarter fighters with more bells and whistles.  The world powers begin to doubt the Jaeger program, whose director Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba; The Losers, Prometheus) is running out of options.<br /><br />Despite the simple story, there is a steady flow of information to keep us informed and updated about the Jaeger program and what we know about the Kaijus.  It provides a nice balance between the action, which was delivered with a sense of uncertain urgency as to just how bad things were going to become for the Jaeger pilots in many situations.  To put it briefly, the dire consequences of piloting a Jaeger are realistically depicted even as we enjoy a world-threat story in which humanity actually unites instead of letting our differences impede our success.<br /><br />Pentecost turns to ex-pilot Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam; Sons of Anarchy) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi; Assault Girls), who get the most attention among several pairs of Jaeger pilots we meet.  Mori is meant to strong and complex, but to me her character seems ill-imagined and entirely out of place.  Raleigh isn't perfect either, but at least he's not another one of those \\"reluctant heroes.\\"  There's a little romantic interest there and I think it fails both in execution and contribution to the movie.<br /><br />Interspersed between pilot-Jaeger highlights we have a pair of bantering scientists who provide some silly, charming comic relief.  Dr. Gottlieb (Burn Gorman; The Dark Knight Rises, Red Lights) is some sort of physicist and Dr. Newt Geiszler (Charlie Day; who brings a welcomed quirky performance) is some combination xenobiologist-neurobiologist-biomedical engineer.  Lastly, Ron Perlman's Hannibal Chau is a Kaiju parts broker.  Why is he in this? I'd just say because del Toro can't seem to make a movie without him...Hellboy 2, Blade 2, Cronos.<br /><br />Returning to the effects, the effects make this movie. They don't \\"save\\" it.  They make it a satisfying experience all on their own.  The Kaiju each come with their own distinct appearance and fighting style, and the same goes for each Jaeger and its pilots.  In fact, the Jaegers and Kaiju are presented as their own named characters.  Amazing attention to detail was placed on the movements of these over-sized combatants, their surroundings and how they destructively plow into and through them.  I already can't wait to watch it again because so much was going on in each of these fights that I feel I must have missed a lot of clever nuance.<br /><br />See this movie.  Then see it again!.<br /><br />Returning to the effects, the effects make this movie. They don't \\"save\\" it.  They make it a satisfying experience all on their own.

B008QYT7DI|5.0|I love the book.  It is not to be read through quickly.  While it appears on the surface to be a simple child's fantasy; and a child would thoroughly enjoy it; has a trove of deep thinking and reflection beneath it that adults would do well to take note of.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is a must have for all ages. Its better than temple run 1 and 2 and even better than subway suffer too.
B00B4804KS|5.0|The movie was god but in 3D it was fantastic, over the top. Thanks for the thrill of a lifetime!!!!!
B00BIR381W|5.0|I LOVE this show!!! The show will keep you guessing till the end. The writers know exactly how to surprise their viewers. Just wish more people would give it a try.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Great to see an update in the story line of this iconic character.  Makes you want to see the next JB film.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Ellie's album is definitely worth getting. All of her songs are awesome to listen to, especially while walking on a treadmill.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Gentle story of growing up in old rural times.  Always with a moral, but also always with some fun. Great.
B005M7P9XE|5.0|This album is one of the best I have ever purchased.  Hurts is a great band with a lot of talent.  Their songs are extremely powerful both in lyrics and music.  I have no words to describe the vocals.  This album goes perfectly with their second album &#34;Exile.&#34;  Buy this album!  The DVD that is included has a fantastic concert and their great music videos.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I will most certainly miss Mitch Rapp given the demise of a great author like Vince Flynn in the mystery suspense genre.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Awesome game and my son loves it as well. The different obstacles are fun and the animation is pretty good.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Luv this little guy. Helps to plan, doesn't take up space!  Just before you start a road trip, checking the life is super easy and fast!
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|This app is amazing, the way it is put together makes it wonderful. The one problem, it needs more WW2 guns. Some suggestions are<br />Russian: DPM, PPSh, Mosin-Nagant<br />United Kingdom: Lee-Enfield, Sten, Bren LMG<br />Germany: MP40, MG42, Kar98k<br />United States: BAR, M3A1 &quot;Grease Gun&quot;<br />Other assorted guns: Welrod, M1911, Springfield 03<br />Just a few more WW2 era guns.<br />As I said before, this is a wonderful app.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Just good entertainment is all.  I think Channing Tatum did a great job- great dancer and Matt Mc is pretty funny.  Not a great movie, but enjoyable and some good eye candy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like minion rush really fun and its just like timple run but better<br />I can be completely bored and go and play on minion rush and I will be completely non bored
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|For me, Bradley Cooper just shines in this role.  He nails the role.  Great film.  Enjoyed it very much- entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun for horse lovers. Love to play and earn new tack, outfits and farms. Caring and grooming is fun and rewarding. I really enjoy playing.<br />Wish there weren't so many pop ups.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|I have an Acer Aspire R7 which does not have an Ethernet port. I literally took this thing out of the package and plugged it in to my machine and within a minute it was ready to use automatically. Seems like it is built fairly well also. The cable part of the adapter has a strain relief on both ends.
B00ABLJ5NQ|3.0|This book did not have the depth and character development of his other books.  I loved American Gods, Neverwhere and Anansi Boys but this book is not in the same class.<br /><br />The concept is good but its too short and the story arc does not allow enough time to get truly immersed in the book's universe of place and people.  It felt to me that the book was rushed, there was not enough exposition to get a proper feel for the protagonists and their motivations.<br /><br />Quite a good read but it left me wanting much more and a bit disappointed.
B005HEK3JW|4.0|This season surprises you with a visit from Leonard Nimoy playing the role of Spock one more time. It also flushes out some story lines of minor characters like Ensign Ro and begins to show Captain Picard having a softer side. The season also focuses a bit on Worf's story as well. Overall, it's a good season.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movie and my favorite thing to watch is t h e minion s there so cute and fun to eat c.f. h
B0000046KM|5.0|Back in the 90s I joined one of those CD clubs where you started off with 8 for $1 or whatever; I took a few I'd never heard of but that looked interesting.<br /><br />How excellent!
B009GX7IRA|4.0|This show just keeps getting better. The characters really mesh with each other. DiNozzo is s howing a surprisingly soft side.<br />Suspenseful and keeps you coming back for more
0425252868|5.0|The best book I've read in years! It should be made into a movie, if it hasn't been yet.<br /><br />Dr Adam
1451668945|5.0|This book is a suspenseful, enjoyable read that one expects from Mary Higgins Clark.  I can highly recommend this book.
B00881VLCE|3.0|app was really good loved it. when I updated the app it ruined it. it lags now when moving pieces. pieces are harder to see now. please fix it because I love to put the puzzles together and cant do it at home due to having small children.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|What a tremendous CD. Masterfully performed and how wonderfully appropriate the new songs that he added. They blend right in with the old classics.
B004UID2LC|4.0|easy to use app to search for and download as video or mp3. For those of you who who don't know how to use your Kindle Fire and are unable to figure this app out, &quot;it has no search&quot;, &quot;&quot;how do I download&quot;, etc. FYI that icon in the middle of the lower menu bar (the square that looks like a bookshelf) is used for many apps including this one to pull up a menu of options like search, downloads, current downloads, playlists etc. There lies the key to your future success, as for those expecting YouTube this is not it so why give it a poor review due to ignorance...
B004MGMIA8|5.0|I'm a big Johann Strauss fan. It's great to have everything that he composed. Sound quality is also very good.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|This freeze on me and when I tap trapped in the closet pour it up show up fix it now please
B008JFUNYG|4.0|Intense, gory and occasionally creepy, this is horror done right. Whether you're an old school, hardcore fan or you're a horror-lite newb, EVIL DEAD (2013) is flat-out entertaining from beginning to end. Sure, it's a remake and right now the only thing worse than a remake is LIKING remake, but it's a fun film, sorry traditionalists. If you're looking for a line for line rehash, this isn't it though there are a few classics bits in here fans of the original film will catch.<br /><br />I was able to watch EVIL DEAD in the theater with my wife, a non-horror fan, and we both enjoyed it, probably a bit more on my end. It was entertaining and insanely bloody, something horror films have been lacking for a few years now. I can't say this was an amazing film but it's certainly in the Top 10 Best Horror Films of 2013, that's for sure. Is this a rental or a purchase? I plan to purchase. If you're not put off by it's remake/sequel status and you're looking for something unique, I'd say purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG.... I thought this game was BORING,but when I downloaded I got addicted to this game because is really FUN... The most part of this game that I like is doing the mission's.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|get it its so fun and so simple like subway suffers and their is a girt code and if you get a code right you get something
B0088WLEL6|5.0|This is one of SyFy's best shows.  Start with Season 1 and follow through.  A very interesting and unique space adventure series, it is some good characters.  I would like to see the show continue.
1451683405|2.0|A compatibilist may not be consistent in his view that free will and determinism are compatible but he  is certainly consistent when he is recommending a certain  course of action or preferring something over something else . A determinist like harris may be consistent in his view that every thing is determined but he is certainly inconsistent when he is recommending this or that e.g. asking for believing in determinism as it would change our attitude towards criminals or it would be better for our mental health or it would reduce our self criticism. all these statements implies implicit free will. if sam harris is determined to tell us that free will is false and we are determined to accept or reject his view then these recommendations are meaningless in the context of absolute determinism.<br />He also tell us that determinism is not fatalism and by believing in determinism people will not just sit back but will continue their work. this is a clear contradiction. if it matters that I continue my work or stop doing my work then it means that adopting one course of action rather then another will have different effects on my future. This mattering is meaningless without assuming some notion of free will. here Sam Harris is also negating the importance of the effects of belief .if belief in determinism is not causing passivity then belief in free will or religion should also have no effects.<br />sam harris,s approach towards the problem of free will is confused. he is not a determinist but he can rightly be called as a soft compatibilist.<br />it has remained a dilemma for the determinists that they cannot reconcile their determinism with their call for change and therefore end up advocating compatibilism rather then determinism.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|there were a few episodes that are not able to be seen... but the series is so good... I recommend it
1595828753|5.0|I just want to say that everyone whines about how much they say sweetie, but it *really* isn't too outrageous. It's a little cringy, but it's not unreasonable, and I don't think they say it more than like 3-5 times...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is just like a temple runner of sorts but it is still a great FREE game I recommend.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Never imagined all so complete and useful to serve as an utility. Takes a while to see everything it can do for you.<br />I have less than 30 days to decide and go for Pro-version, which again is hampered by a big bill of 3£/month.<br />To pay 36£,  all I have to do is see if I can produce something out of it in a year?/every year?<br />Leave e it to me,I do like it and may go for it.
0345472322|5.0|Total mind check, really great for all parents and anyone who works with or have children!<br />Really helps you to focus on your words and actions and how it affects kids.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey just keeps getting better! Season three has it all including good plot twists and turns. It won't disappoint.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|The action is outragous! Angelina Jolie is phenomenal as usual!<br />I would recommend this movie to any and everyone.<br />This movie is one for your collection.  You can watch it over and over.
B00BESM14U|5.0|its heartfelt and very relateable to anyone without a perfect high school experience.... so, everyone! It is well worth it to rent or own this movie.
B003QSOE0U|2.0|This is more of a love story then it is about war, all together there is about 45minutes of action in a movie thats 2 and half hours long, I didnt kno michael Bay Directed it but in my opinion I expected a war movie not a love story
0738702994|5.0|This is my very favorite Tarot deck. The pictures are incredibly beautiful on each card, and it comes with the book included. The major arcana is depicted with Celtic figures, so in the description the story is told and then the explanation of what the meaning is for reading the card. For the minor arcana, although the pictures are unique, they mainly follow the depictions from the Rider Waite deck. I love the descriptions in meaning for each card in the whole deck because I can relate and understand them so well.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|A well done adventure story.  The underlying rationale for the story is not well described;  I mean the reason for the Hunger Games.  But it was well written and kept me involved and eager to know what happened next.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The Beatles, as you know, are exceptional and I think anybody would enjoy going back and re-listening to this music again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this is an awesome game.lots of different levels to challenge me.I keep playing for hours.everyone can enjoy this game at any age.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|The story already has you pulled in, this is going to keep you wanting more!  Harry Potter fans will be left craving the next one immediately as usual!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Fun game with new design twists. Have 3 other Mahjong games but this one is becoming my favorite. Use on my Kindle also.
030758836X|5.0|Sounds trite but... self-absorption and self-righteousnous gone amok.  SO well-written, engaging, and entertaining.  Ok, so it's dark but she made it funny and made me want to know these characters.  Many marriage-focused books are just not entertaining for a Never-Married like me.  Taking us thru the retrospective on their courtship was engaging rather than &#34;gagging&#34;.  THANK YOU, MS. FLYNN!!!
B0023SDPS6|3.0|I enjoyed the Wyoming setting and rambling office banter. The closing chapters picked up the pace a bit and may have drawn me into the next book's orbit. I've read through all of CJ Box's books, so this was my compromise - if you have to choose how you spend your kindle budget...go with CJ Box.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game, but I am stuck on level 5 the last step to get out. All I need is a hint, it would be nice to supply it if needed by the player.. Thanks
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I liked it, moved along nicely good plot, great character all in all a good read.<br />I would recommend it to adventure readers.  It was never over sentimental or sexy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Character development, writing, plot twists.  I enjoy stories portraying the best and worst of humans under extreme conditions.  Although I am not generally a zombie fan, the writing elevates this series to something far more.
B00CNEVHMG|3.0|(Audio Fidelity release) This will probably never sound much better than the decent remastering by Hoffman, but it was never a favorite work by Yes to me and I resold it after a couple of listens. Just not very compelling. But if you like this album I say go for it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Still very much like fifty shades though it lacks the characters and depth.  Still a good smut novel overall. Will read the next one
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|still getting the hang of it,  but keeps me smiling!<br />the graphics are really great and the minion cracks me up!
B00AJER3SE|5.0|It will be good to purchase this remastered copy if you have not own it on Blu Ray format. The picture qualitiy is good but the sound qualitiy is OK,not excellent. After so many times of viewing, this movie has not lost it's shine. I have own it on VHS, LD and DVD.<br />It is worth the money if you do not own it on Blu Ray format.
159102594X|5.0|Fantastic fantasy book, first in a series of three. This is Joe Abercrombies first published series and it doesn't disappoint. Within minutes of finishing this book I ordered the next two. Very worth your time to read. Adult language
B003JUGQ38|5.0|At first I was apprehensive watching a British sci-fi show.  But after watching the first episode of season 1, I was hooked.  The effects are a little campy but that is the point.  The humor and wit of the Dr is incredible.  Whether it is Ecclestone, Tennant, and now Smith, these actors who portray the Dr is why the show is so good.  The story lines are good as well.  The show does a good job of bringing back antagonists throughout each season.  Season 4 is no different.  The final episodes with David Tennant are simply epic and great television.  This series is TRUE science fiction.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I absolutely love this series. It is a high class, beautifully produced show. Costumes and scenery are wonderful and the acting is superb!
B007REV4YI|5.0|A 5-star film to complete my Bond 50 collection !!! Picture is all clear and sound is ever crisp on Bluray...
B009K0P10K|5.0|Had no idea this was on TV.  It is intriguing and suspenseful.  Can't stop watching it. Don't know what after Season 2.  I hope it is still on TV.
B00BTHV05M|4.0|Another great release from One Republic! I own every \\"album\\" and enjoy each one. They are each a little different and Native is same quality as others.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The older version was easier to get the info I wanted to see and the maps were easier to start when you have an alert it was nice to get to the information quickly.
147674355X|5.0|★★★★★★ SIMPLY AMAZING!! One of my favorite books of all time! This book was perfect in every way. I highly recommend!
0452270073|5.0|Even if I had to read this story for an english class I had taken, I still enjoyed the story immensely
B005U9QJY2|5.0|Amazing movie. Huge nostalgia for any child of the late 80's early 90s that was into these types of sci-fi/fantasy movies.
1573228737|4.0|Enjoyed the book even if I was required to read it for an English course. Would probably read again if I had the time
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|One of the best action movies I have seen in a while.  Wish all the comic book movies were this well made.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It is a good way to kill some free time. I love this game it's fun  to play and ya
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|I could relate to this book with every page I read.  It was a great read.  My only word of caution is the ending is VERY optimistic.  Hopefully people realize not every story ends this way.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Enough cultural references to keep adults interested, enough silliness and action to keep kids interested.  Everyone needs &#34;minions&#34; in their vocabulary.
B003U53GK8|5.0|So good that we watched the whole series within 5 months! Definitely recommend to anyone who likes mystery and suspense.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Very good book, but sometimes he would go into too much detail and history.  I would recommend it to others.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|I enjoy the ESV in hard copy and think that it is one of the best translations and concordances that one can get....but the electronic version is a bit complicated to read and I suffered to understand where and how. but, now I started figguring it out and can enjoy the Bible.
B007WPM4P0|5.0|I like this kind of movie. No brainier enjoyable to watch. What happen to season 2??? Is it in Amazon? I am looking forward to watch the next season.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a little slow at times but it kept moving. I am definitely looking forward to the next book:)
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app works good for my phone. would recommend it to others. i have a gs3. have a nice day
B001AITH50|4.0|pretty good movie one of your better vampire movies.at least it was realistic. it showed vampires in their true light.not a lot of romance if that is what you are looking for.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is a great book although it ends rather abruptly with the author's explanation at the end.  I would recommend it and am glad I didn't have to wait five years for the next book.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|best horror/super natural movie I have seen in a long time!!! I urge all u jaded horror/super natural fans to give it a watch! believe me u will not be sorry! it's a must watch
0061998494|5.0|It is great learning all about Craig's life. It is well written and funny. I bought this book used and it was like brand new.
B004AP9W46|4.0|I liked the book but not my fav.confusing in parts and very drawn out like ms rice was trying to fill the pages. but a must read if you are reading the chronicles I have read them all and din't lose interst .but I like the books where she mixed the mayfair witches with the vampires could not put them down.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This \\"new\\" update is junk.  The old app was right to the point.  Now it is a complete mess.  What is the with the points for viewing sponsor's<br />stuff?  Who hands are in who's pockets.  Your update did more harm than good.  As you see, people, including myself are dropping your app.  Way to go, drive everyone to your competitors.  Time to fire the person that came up with this update.  We don't want videos and seasonal pictures, we want the weather, plain and simple.  Bye.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|While I was expecting a better story, I did still enjoy the weaving of Hosseini's art. Everything came together in the end... kind of... and after a lot of breathing room. I always enjoy reading about other cultures/societies etc. So I would still say the book was pretty good, but not a favorite.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome I play it more than the kids. I love playing it on kindle fire. Can't get enough of the minions!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Dissapointed! seems like a cute game and has the potential to be one....but the want you to purchase pearls and such with real money! Its the Smurf game all over! Then if that's not bad enough they want kids to gamble! they want you to spend your game money to buy a chance on what's inside a treasure chest! FOR SHAME!!!!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|JUST NOT MY CUP OF TEA.. HEARD IT WAS GOOD.. IT WAS OK.. NOTHING TO RAVE ABOUT FOR ME. OH WELL
B00B4804KS|2.0|Strictly talking about 3D.<br /><br />I'm going to be honest here. The 3D I'm expecting from all these supposedly 3D HD movies is off screen action, scare me off my seat type like I recall back in the 80's. My SONY 3D T.V has sample 3D videos which are mind blowing. It supports 3D active shutter glasses and it looks amazing. The depths of perception is incredible.<br /><br />I've purchased 11 3D movies including Jurassic Park and it's been disappointment after disappointment when it comes to 3D movies.  My problem is not with the movie itself but rather the poor utilization of 3D technology. Personally, I don't want to watch a children's pop up book via my active shutter glasses. I want a Dino jumping at my face making me feel unsafe and ready to be eaten.<br /><br />This will be the last time I spend a dime on 3D movie until something incredible comes along. Usually, I don't get upset very easily but I feel ripped off. Kept telling myself one of these movies is going to be great in 3D but all of them fall short of my expectations. Jurassic Park is just one more on that list.<br /><br />If you just care for HD blueray great but I wouldn't splurge $30+ for 3D that doesn't have a truly powerful wow factor.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not happy about waiting till 2014 to see the next season, but I will be on the couch with bells-on.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read this book in one day. Great read! Look forward to reading the next one. Highly recommend it to friends.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm so looking forward to the next season! I've watched the whole series start to finish two times already.  I'm a lover of period pieces to start with and this one is so full of wonderful characters that I can care about (both positive and negative).  This is just a beautifully done program.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My review will not be as thorough as the others available, but, I SECOND ALL THE ENTHUSIASTIC 5 STAR reviews. I truly enjoyed this game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's the best! I've even watched the episodes more than once and  can't wait for Season 4, 5, and more!!!!!
B00B1RB942|5.0|The item was just as expected and in excellent condtion.  Would definitely use the shipper again for future items.  Son absolutely loves this.
B007N5YJWK|4.0|Great early work by Hitch. Recommended. Criterion is always good. Blue ray can't improve toomucha filfrom the 1930s!  But looks good
0399226907|5.0|I loved this book so much! You can learn so many different things from this book.  I like how you can learn about eating healthy and learn colors, also can learn days of the week and the butterfly/caterpillar life cycle.  It is great! I would encourage anyone to buy it and use the book in their home with their children. :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this game all day it's really addicting also they should add the nether portal and the aether.<br />7+ iwould reccamend
B00BVGNWES|4.0|Liked Story, Characters , and the Actors! Enjoyed how the Main Character evolved through the Movie and had Great Ending!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I loved the show because it is entertaining without being smutty and intellectually insulting.  Most of the episode stores are witty and the seasonal storyline is intriguing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game it is really stupid and  I hate the movie it skips on my kindle th bc Dr uhh f g b
B000MMBRJY|5.0|This is a horrible movie. But most DVDs are the even worse 'Director's Cut'. THIS DVD is the original version as released in 1982. A horrible film, yes, but at least now I have ALL the ACTUAL movies, instead of 2 of the movies and a clipshow of the first movie pretending to be the second.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved this book it was hard to put down. I didn't think there would be a 4th book but I'm glad there is!
B002LANLDK|4.0|Its just what you expect it would be. Great fun, cool cars.  As the mother of teen boys there are a few too many gratuitous short skirt/bikini shots but the older I get the more prudish I get!  No overt sex scenes.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This cd is great. many great songs that really inspire. It is just as good as the first if not better.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Was excited to see it, I lived through the real news.  This movie was just not my cup of tea.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I saw the movie with my teenage  kids and wanted to read the book to see if it would be any better.  Sadly the movie was much better it only was an hour and a half and told the same story as the book. The book add little to the story and was a waste of my day it took to read. Sorry I will wait for the movies of the other two books it will be cheaper and less a waste of my time.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Thought this might be sort of a throw-away, but it happens that it was a great flick! Teen boys and mom all loved it.  We are excited to see Red2!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is seriously entertaining for all ages. I hate that a takes a little longer to download but the wait is totally worth it.

B007GE2H3G|5.0|The story is true to its roots.  The comic strip &#34;come to life.&#34; As it were.  I especially enjoyed seeing Tin Tin's Austen Healey Sprite (frogeye) toward the end.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is the ish man! Download it nizzow for real- even if you don't like card games you'll get addicted to Spider solitare. I've been on my Kindle play in it for like three hours. DAMN! 5 thumbs up
0375842209|5.0|I have never been into historical fiction but for some reason I saw this book at the store and the title caught my eye. The book is, in fact, about a book thief.<br /><br />The book discusses the times of the holocaust in the perspective of a German family that is not in fact to happy with Hitler's ideas for the country or the deaths of the Jews, but the ways in which they must sit through many of these things in order to survive. It is told through the perspective of Death. I will not say anything else because I do not want to spoil it, but this book will make you LOVE and HATE some of the characters. It will make you want to punch some of them in the face or high five them for their choices. I recommend this book to everyone that loves to read, because the main character is a lover of books and words.<br /><br />I cried at the ending because I felt like I personally knew these people. <3
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This an amazing book........  my head can't take it anymore I want to know when they get marred...... I hope it's a happy ending.......
B003B1X80Y|5.0|I just discovered this story, for some reason it decided to wait almost 10 years to come into my life. I loved it wholeheartedly. It's one of the simplest yet soul-touching love stories. Love each other until you die....isn't it a dream? Isn't it a blessing? How extremely rare it is. The acting is great too.
0738737909|5.0|I like the images too much. They are wonderfull pictures. I like the box too.<br />Thanks yo very much.<br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Virginia Buceta
B0061S0A64|4.0|I absolutely love this app. I am into music production and composition so this is a fun little toy/tool. My only wish is that I could zoom in and out of the work station to fine tune the note patterns. Please update.

B00CLUMDRA|5.0|TV Guide picked Elvis as the greatest entertainer of the 20th century, and these albums certainly bear that out. The quality is superb.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Good listening....I play it constantly in my car when driving.  What I love about  his singing is that you can understand every, every single word.  Mr. Buble's diction is impeccable.  Most vocal artists today sound as if they are chewing on crap while singing.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|He's chosen another implausible conceit around which to develop this new book.  I really enjoy watching him work out the conceits, but &#34;American Gods&#34; is still my fave.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|Written for the young reader.  As an adult I found it an easy read.  Caters to the very young reader.  However, I enjoy reading it.

1742200508|5.0|England is one of my favorite countries to visit. The usual adjectives come to mind: historical, beautiful, architectural. I have been there a few times over the years, but I've kept to two large cities (London of course, and Birmingham) with day trips to Cambridge and Oxford. What little time I spent there leads me to feel like there was more to see, much more. The Lonely Planet guide to England shows me just how much there is to discover.<br />This nearly 850 page book is just the right size to carry around without it feeling cumbersome. The pages are light but strong and the typeface very easy to read. What the authors feel is important information is highlighted and draws the eye and the construction of the book itself is sturdy, with only very rough use likely to cause it damage.<br />Part history text, part omniscient tour guide, the book is filled with simple but concise maps and precise references to information about various traditionally tourist sites, accommodations, eateries, shopping and transportation. I wager there's not much the traveler will miss but what's even more interesting is how brilliantly all this information fits without appearing to be overcrowded. The writing is freewheeling and humorous but also tight and highly informative.<br /><br />The first 50 pages color-coded red is the \\"plan your trip\\" portion covering such important bits as transportation, the best season for a visit, exchange rates and so forth. However, interspersed throughout the book are more color-red tabbed pages that further describes pertinent sections related to planning, sometimes in excellent colorful maps. Listing worthy experiences and locations sets the tone: which cathedrals and castles to see along with short descriptions of each explaining why. Top events arranged by month may help decide when to visit as well. I particular like the itineraries section that suggests starting points for a trip based on time available. The `England Express' expands on what to do when you only have 8-10 days and if you have two to three weeks (lucky!) there's the `Heart of England' itinerary that starts in London, looping through Sussex and into Hampshire then going out west to Bath and the picture-perfect Cotswolds.<br />This section ends with essential checklists and discusses traveling with children before ending with a useful ratings guide to England's regions at a glance.<br /><br />This is the main, meaty part of the book. Filled to the brim with information about sights, sounds, sleeping, eating, entertainment and transportation; everything is laid out just about perfectly. Each entry has apt information highlighted, any contact telephone numbers or website URLs, nearest tube stations, etc. Interleaved are maps and colored sections showing extra-special places `Worth a Trip' such as the iconic Abbey Road (\\"Stop-start local traffic is long accustomed to groups of tourists lining up on the zebra crossing to reenact the over of the fab four's 1969 masterpiece and penultimate swan song Abbey Road.\\")<br />This section is compiled by region (eg. Oxford, Cotswolds & Around) with a leading page listing the `Best Places to Eat' and `Best Places to Stay', `Why to Go?' and `When to Go' along with regional maps showing highlights of that region.<br /><br />The final section of the book is the Survival Guide which goes into the technicalities of a trip to England. General pricing information for hotels and other accommodation is explained along with what to look out for to avoid being bilked. Typical English climate, business hours for banks, bars, cafes, the electrical outlet information (240V at 50Hz), embassy and consulate information, health, insurance, public holidays, train passes, and a glossary round out this section.<br /><br />This is an exhaustively researched book, top-notch writing and filled with immediately useful information. The layout is pleasing to the eye and pertinent information is easily identifiable. Lonely Planet continuesits tradition of putting out excellent stuff and this book raises that already high standard that much more. 5 well-deserved stars.its tradition of putting out excellent stuff and this book raises that already high standard that much more. 5 well-deserved stars.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is the third in a series of Quell games I have downloaded. It's just as well done as the first two. Splendid animation with unintrusive background music. Same slow and thoughtful game-playing process. If you like casual maze games, you will like all three Quell apps, including this latest one.
B001NAT05W|1.0|If you want to watch Halle Berry bounce around in skin tight outfits!  Its your movie!! If you want a plot that makes sense and you can't stomach cringe worthy acting skip it. It reminds me of when I turned 5 and Jerry Lewis movies stopped being funny and instead you looked for something to hide behind as it was not just awful but embarrassingly awful (unless your french for some reason)
1250007208|4.0|Cinder is an imaginative re-telling of Cinderella told in post-apocalyptic China {or New Beijing}. Now, before I lose all of you hardcore fairytale fans who shake their heads at re-tellings, let me tell you one thing. Cinder is very loosely based on the fairytale. I know there's a lot of re-tellings where they basically just take the story and add different bits and pieces, but Cinder is not like that at all. Sure, there's Cinderella, whose lost her father, and is basically a servant in her household. And of course, there's Prince Charming and a ball involved, but other than that, there's not much similarities. If it weren't for the cover and the title, it might actually take a little while before you realize that this is a retelling of Cinderella.<br /><br />I loved the characters in it! And I must say that Peony is a wonderful name! They're my favorite flowers! Anyway, I liked how Cinder had at least one human friend in the world, rather than a ton of adoring animals and every human hates her. Her relationship with her sister is so precious. I also had quite a time imagining what Iko might have looked like. The descriptions were just so vague, and it was quite fun and humorous to imagine what a white bulbous-headed android looked like. The doctor dude seemed a little sketchy to me at first. Did anyone else feel like that? He was just so obnoxious when the chapters were in his perspective, and it annoyed me. But then, when Cinder came into his office, he was sweet as cherry pie. I don't really understand, but at least I didn't want to slap him throughout the whole book! And Kai. Oh, Kai. I just loved him. He's so wonderful and ahhh. You might think I'm crazy, but I love a good villain who I just hate with a burning passion. That means that the author/writer/director has done their job and done it well! Queen Levana just made me want to slap her face off every time she showed {or didn't} it! Ugh, she makes me mad!<br /><br />Okay, let's just talk about this world. Oh my god, this world. The story world was so amazing and imaginative. I've seen/read many sci-fis, and I've seen/read many stories of Cinderella, but somehow, Marissa manages to keep it fresh, satisfying, and intriguing. I mean, seriously? Futuristic China complete with robots, hovers, and a awesome zombie-ish plague!? Oh, wait there's more. There's also a kingdom on the moon, you guys! Pick this book up now, I say! I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next!<br /><br />I will say that there was an issue of predictability for me. In one possibly major area. There were a lot of twists and turns that I definitely did not see coming, and that was refreshing for the slam of predictability there was. I hate it when I do that, but somehow, I always predict the ending and it's awful. And I hate when I'm right. Ugh.<br /><br />One other thing that I didn't care for was the prejudice against cyborgs. I mean, come on! She's a cyborg, so what? There are people who fricken LIVE ON THE MOON! AND THEY'RE RULING YOU! What's wrong with a little cyborg? Especially Kai. Ugh, I hate how unforgiving he was in that aspect -.- CYBORGS ARE PEOPLE TOO YOU KNOW!<br /><br />Other than that, I loved Cinder! It was almost all my favorite things in one place. Sci-fi, fantasy, zombie kinda action going on. Ugh, I loved it! Marissa took so many things that are over-used and worn-out and meshed them together, creating a fresh new world. I can't wait to read the next book! If she can come up with this from Cinderella, imagine what she can come up with from Little Red Riding Hood! ARE YOU IMAGINING!?<br /><br />Cover Love<br /><br />Ah, this cover! I love the gothic font too much. I never really like fonts like that, but it just fits! I also love the red shoe that just stands out and is born to be on the cover of a Cinderella book. I also love how the bionic leg is just visible through the skin.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this is okay but unless you plan to go and buy more coins you will run out quickly. Its fun every now and then
1595826971|5.0|For anyone looking for any supplementary material to the world of Alice the madness returns this is it.<br />The dark tone is reflected in this art book and the images and information provided are a must have for any fans of either the original Alice or the sequel.<br /><br />Hardcover book, lots of artwork and design sketches,  commentary from the designers and promotional material.<br /><br />Good stuff
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is funny for all ages.  There's humor in it for adults as well as kids.  The story is great, and a good message.
0545403359|4.0|the book is a great read and i really enjoy the pictures that are included. the book was in great condition and a nice price.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Let me begin by saying I thought Knocked Up was mediocre at best. So, if that is more your type of movie then I could see why this would seem \\"slow\\". This isn't a slapstick farce full of outrageous unrealistic characters. It is a witty representation of a family with middle aged adults who each still look in the mirror and see a 20 year old kid ready to take life by the balls. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud this many times. Every one in this film is believable; with spot on timing. A fing plus!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not a soap opera person but I have gotten caught up in all the gossip and comraderie.  I also like the way history is intermingled with the story.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|would have given it 5 stars as it reads easily but lenghty and repetitious.  The writer made me realize how truly eruptive he was.
B009QU9X44|4.0|...really interesting reading.....story telling at its best........this is the sunny side of Lagos....no darkness, armed robbery, poverty, hunger....the same Nigeria we see in Nollywood and not the &#34;welcome to Lagos&#34; Nigeria
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book was incredible. The storytelling made me feel my ow Blood Song. I would recommend this book to anyone with a love of fantasy. It made my wait for the Winds of Winter 3 days shorter, though now I wait for the next installment of this series. Thank you Mister Ryan.
B00AEFXEN6|5.0|5 stars because Spacey, as usual, nailed his role...this time as mid life crisis father and husband in a typical dysfunctional, loveless, family climaxing to a rational end. But it's done as only Spacey could deliver....no surprises there. A superb narrative of an extended, inescapable, epiphany.  Totally credible.
B00CEB5QU2|1.0|It takes too long to read the external drive. It  has a very slow slow slow response. i try to return it but the seller was quick to point out that my return time has pass which was a day so he will not accept the return. It is just one piece of useless device I have shelved.
B005Q1W10A|2.0|The last disc, last episode would not play.  We had to go rent it somewhere to finish the  second season.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm okay with the story continuing on past book 3.  I love the characters and am looking forward to more fun with them.  I'm sure there will be a happy ending.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Maybe I'm just a newb to the game but I wish I could sync with my game on Facebook. be nice to pick up where I left off in both places.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app my friends and I play together and we have lots of fun u will to it is 7$ but it is worth every penny you'll. love it
B005DJREJS|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I found it very entertaining.  I am no longer a high school age person, yet I was gripped by the story lines each week.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I am mad.  no outraged that they don't have the game.  I will keel the amazon appstore!  and you need to figure out the level yourself my homies!!
0525953728|5.0|This is for the reader in the family. They enjoy reading the latest books instead of waiting of the local library to get them.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|The first thing I loved about &#34;Paul&#34; was, like alien life, it was under the radar.  I never heard of it.  I rented it.  Then I bought it.  It's a great story about two highly likeable geeks, supported by a powerful and well-cast team of first-rate actors.  Not to mention a very tight story.  Who better to portray the computer-generated (expensively and exquisitly) alien than Seth Rogen.  Put this on with &#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; and show your friends you've got quality taste in science fantasy.  Or scare the hell out of your date whom you're trying to convince you are NOT a wallowing geek.  You can't go wrong.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I really wanted her to end up with Eric, the love that they seemed to have was the best part, I loved that couple....I didn't really enjoy this last book.
1449437524|5.0|me and wife love this book to bits, I thought about buying this book before my dog prematurely died, and now it seems all the more fitting, sitting side by side with my Peanut in her urn.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good comic show. Lots of action and fun and not too dumb. Even my girlfriend watched the whole thing...OK she watched Thor, but she didn't fall asleep and that's a minor miracle.
B005EVVPUE|5.0|I have not bought the product yet, but was wondering if anyone knows what the difference is between the DVDs in this 4-disc set (with 2 DVDs and 2 CDs) and the 2 DVD set. Is the second DVD the same?
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This is the best Queensryche album since Promised Land in 1994. Todd La Torre is an awesome vocalist and honestly does a better job than Geoff Tate ever did.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Just when you think you can't figure the level out you find that elusive clue!! Tons of fun!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Really enjoyed her book.  Not surprised as I also really enjoyed her other book.  Quick read and lots of twists and turns int he plot.
B0060D08JO|5.0|Great film!  Can't wait for the sequel.  Special effects are awesome, so is the acting--just can't grasp why the movie didn't make more money.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 lives up to its predecessors- I watched it in a marathon and can't believe I have to wait until it starts again in January.
B008W14ZD2|5.0|Can't complain musically, it has it all. Great tunes that are catchy. Always great to hear how someone has been blessed with great writing and creativity. My one question would be Adam seems to be a person where his faith is important to him. He seemed to be a little more vocal about it in the lyrics on his last release, &#34;All things Bright...&#34;, so what changed? Or did I miss something?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have looked at this app in the last year with a less then favored interest because of the arcade type games. Then I downloaded it and the app is one of my favorite  apps ! The app starts off with a low amount of coins to use, you also have the option to purchase more. The challenge is in the placement of these coins where to &quot;drop&quot; the coin and &quot; How Many&quot;  Both are important in order to earn prizes so you can advance in the app. So get past the question of If you will like it, down load it, the app works without a WiFi connection an added plus for those peeps who take their Kindle Fire with them every where they go, I Do!!!! Enjoyable App,not difficult but still is a challenge within it's self.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Downton is a great series and season 2 is no exception. Overall, acting is great and story telling is engrossing.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app, you can download it to any device you have it is always at your finger tips
B00AR83PN4|2.0|the controls are awkward and trying to move the cubes is very difficult. the game play itself is very odd and once you get a row of blocks its hard to see the colors and the open spaces beyond
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Omg this games rocks I love when you get to give the horse treats and when you put in in the show it is awesome
B008HK3S9K|5.0|My Kindle Fire HD fits perfectly.  I just wanted to protect my Kindle – so the product is perfect.  Product is sturdy and provides protection.  Product met my expectations.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I am very happy with the 25th year deluxe edition. I think the price was good and I will order again. I will tell all my friends to order because it was free shipping.<br />Thank you
B00957T6X6|3.0|The story has been great so far. I thoroughly enjoyed the TV series on HBO so I decided to read the books until Season 4 comes out. My rating is for the E-book version itself and not the books. This version is basically all the books combined together into one, meaning there's no way to choose between the books, the story just goes on and on through the books, and you can't search by chapters, just page numbers. So if you want to start on Chapter 3, Book 3, hopefully you know what page number that falles on (page 1,962?).
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to rely on this app for weather forecasts, but they recently updated the app..I hate the changes.I just want to get the weather like I did before. It gives you the run around now.not user friendly..Darn.why mess with a good thing.
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|What a great read - I'm late to the World War Z party but it was worth the wait.  Completely immersive, I'm a believer!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter Season 7 was full of surprises, and the finale was awesome. Can't wait to watch Season 8. Too bad I don't have showtime
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I didn't get to see all of season two live so I I have been watching it on prime and its awesome. I love this show. Its one of my favorites.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I like the game pretty well. It's fun to go back and forth between this and  the Candy Crush saga.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I did not like it because it was boring. The violence seemed too much and over the top. Could not recommend it.
1408842432|2.0|This book is Very Well written,  but everyone is so sad and miserable,  it's depressing<br />I would like to see a little happiness
B003WKOU0G|4.0|I watched this film for a class of mine, and it was extremely interesting! It is... not a normal documentary. It basically just shows them each at the same stage and how they develop. It was very interesting to watch, so if you are into human development and differences in culture I would recommend it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All the Harry Potter DVDs in one set. .. so much easier and cheaper than finding them all separately! Just the same movies you know and love!
B00CATSONE|4.0|I am sorry but I have not had time to read the &#34;Nikola Tesla&#34; book as my kindle was stolen and I don't like reading on my IPAD.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Works perfect for controlling my HTPC. Smoother than RDP. Plays video and audio over wifi very smoothly. Easy to install on desktop too.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|A gift for my future mother in law, she loves all his music and it got to her in a reasonable amount of time.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Long book that goes into depth but still awaiting to see if something good happens to the Starks !!! Can't wait till next book.
B0047685I2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  It is a very well made, interesting take on the classic Cinderella story.  The scenery is breathtaking.  The music is beautiful.  It has a great cast.  Angelica Houston as the wicked step mother, Drew Barrymore as Danielle/Cinderella, and of course there has to be the handsome prince charming, portrayed by Dougray Scott.  Overall GREAT movie and worth every penny!!!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Cute game. My 13 year old nephew loves it. He says it's a lot like Donkey Kong. We found it challenging.
B005HEPIDS|3.0|it was ok. by far the worst star trek.  The captain didnt tell the crew how to do there jobs the entire time like season 1 so that was nice.
1847940323|5.0|This is a fantastic, easy to read guide on change. Good for any professional group and in your personal life.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|I loved &#34;Love Song&#34; since I first heard it on the radio some many years ago, and finally invested in her album recently!  This album is wonderful to listen to, with a nice beat and great vocals.  I also really admire her songwriting abilities-- I think her lyrics, especially, are great in that she shows both a strong, independent side and a weaker, more vulnerable side without seeming too whiny or sappy  or just plain spineless without a man (cough cough Taylor Swift).<br /><br />Her songs are all very relaxed; nothing very scream-o.  If you're looking for some great mood music to play at like a coffee shop or something, or some spunk, you've definitely found it in this album.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Finally, Fifty is able to let down his barriers and let someone inside. He also begins to realize why this relationship is different and special.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Make sure you buy all of them at once! It's impossible to stop at the end of this book... you have to read them all!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|More of book I, contd. Get to see a relationship developing between the characters.  New enlightenment on why &#34;fifty&#34; is as he is.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is truly a great show!  Drama, pathos, humor, suspense set against the historic events of early 20th century Great Britian.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|If you are a fan of Amon Amarth then this album is a no-brainer!<br /><br />It is filled with their signature melodies and thunderous drums while changing it up a little bit and playing some of the songs in a refreshingly higher tuning. They are as brutal as ever and I can't get enough of these barbaric Vikings! I raise my goblet to this album!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book had me from the beginning... very well written, the story held me until the end...  life lessons taught by a dog...who knew?
B00AH69BPM|4.0|Honestly, there just isn't too much material Metallica releases that I don' t like. Death Magnetic was a great album and this I guess would be considered the &#34;B-side&#34; of the album. Good listen and addition to Death Magnetic.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Good choice of stars to act in the characters we knew from the ordiginal Star Trek TV servies and movies.  Wanted to watch it before going to second movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it keeps kids entertained so moms get this....lol i love it my little brother likes it so enjoy it..and its FREE :)
B002NXSRVG|3.0|I ordered this thinking it would be OK to watch but discovered it was a little more violent that what I like.  Give to me son and he liked it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|By far the BEST book series I have EVER read. I started this last night and finished it today. Now onto the 3rd! Can't wait for the second movie!
0553582038|5.0|I think the people who hated this novel are the same people who hate prog-rock - they have no patience to allow things to develop!!!  This book is an awesome exercise in exposition - you get so much more information about characters' backgrounds and motivations, and you get introduced to a whole new set of characters in the Dornish and the Ironborn.  It's all going to reach a head at some point, at which time this novel will be all the sweeter.  For everyone who has trouble keeping all the characters straight in their minds (i.e. everyone without a photographic memory), check out the awesome wiki on ASOIAF that's out there - you'll see that all the \\"loose ends\\" really are being wound tighter and tighter with each page.  YOU JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT, AND WAIT FOR THE PAYOFF!!!  Just like when Adam Jones and Danny Carey start their magnum opus of a guitar/drum duet of magnificence about 9 minutes into the song \\"Pushit\\" on Tool's Aenima - good things come to those who wait!!!!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I got hooked after seeing an episode during Season 3.  We went back and watched for the first 2 seasons nonstop.  I  bet we watched 4 episodes a night, until we couldn't stay awake anymore.  Couldn't wait to see what happens next, but we are totally bummed out that they killed Matthew off in Season 3.  Not cool.
B00555X8OA|5.0|A very enjoyable read with a large amount of substance. Many behavioral Econ books are light one experimental data and meat but Kahneman details his long history of work in this book and it is better for it.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|one of my favorite movies of all time and it looked great on the bigger screen! I highly recommend the bluray version!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I used this apps quite a few times,  (on my kindle fire), it is reliable and straight forward. I recommend it .
B000NTPDSW|5.0|i wish they made more trilogies like this! I love watching the godfather and it looks ever better on bluray!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The new design of the weather channel is awkward and unappealing.  I liked the previous version much better.  I'm going to switch to weather bug
B002NXSRX4|3.0|i have no idea why i actually bought this instead of just renting it but oh well. Pretty decent movie to just relax and watch.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is an interesting game. It is a little challenging. It has good story and interesting graphics. Considering buying the full version but $4.99 is kinda steep for me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Variation from easy to very hard. Level 10 was the most challenging for me. The music  becomes annoying after awhile. I would like to see more rooms.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Every book in this Quintet is so different, but I love the way they progress.  This first book is the most action packed and it really introduces you to the main characters in the series - especially Ender and Valentine. It's hard to put down and moves really quickly.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Even though I cannot say that I can relate to this show 100% of the time, but it is funny on how it tries to capture what a typical North American teen might encounter when they are going through their awkward stages in High School.  Even though I am in my early 20s, I can still grab some phrases from this show that I sometimes use.  Good show to make you reminisce of your High School years.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Watching the first in this series is dangerous!  Once you watch one you are completely hooked.  It is fun to find something to watch with characters who are so entertaining and so well rounded.  The BBC makes the best series!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love being able to have the weather whenever I want it. Good job on how it was recently updated. Very user friendly. I don't care anything about earning points for checking the weather but it doesn't bother me either.I would like to add, I did not notice a big drain on the battery overnight because of having this app installed. I read the review where that was a problem for someone else. I think you will enjoy having it on your kindle.
B0070Z97LG|5.0|This movie is full of &#34;twists and the unexpected!!!  Everything will make sense at the end of the movie, so just hang in there!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game, it's fun and challenging at the same time time!  Cannot wait for the next level.
0439023513|5.0|An interesting and fitting wrap-up to the Hunger Games trilogy. Thoroughly enjoyed the entire series; well-written and certainly worth the reading time.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Maroon 5 puts out one fantastic CD after another.  This is no exception.  A great band that just on producing top CD's.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book was thrilling in an old way that made it even more so! It kept me reading till I was sure I would die at the accounts of the March family. It was written with a superiority that to me, surpass ordinary writing of our day! This is a book I would gladly read a thousand times over and recommend to all those wishing for an excellent read!
B004GYY714|5.0|i love have a radiostation on my kindle it is nice to be able to tune into my favorite radio station and not have to be sitting at the computer to do it.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|The movie was alright and it gave a new twist on the story.  Little too much blood and gore for little kids.  Might give nightmares.  I guess you could say the movie is now up to date for these times.
B000QCTNIW|5.0|I found the research presented in this book to be very helpful to me personally and professionally (as a psychotherapist) as I explain to my clients that they have the ability to change their brains throughout the lifespan. The evidence presented here is consistent with the mindfulness approach to therapy I employ with my clients.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I tried the free version first, which I loved the option to mix sounds and that it had a timer. I quickly got bored with the free version and wanted more sound variety. Definitely worth every penny, this app knocks me out. Zzzzzzz.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Hazel and Gus are lovable characters sadly facing the most difficult challenges life can offer. This book inspired me look at how I live my own life.
1417734035|5.0|I was looking for some kind of printable activity sheet for a little girl that came into the clinic where I work.  I found one that was supposed to teach the child to draw the image on the sheet.  And then, it hit me!  I remembered a book that I used to check out from my school library continuously for months at a time.  A Google search later \\"how to draw book simple from the 1970s\\" and I found it!  Oh, the wave of nostalgia that hit me when I saw the cover.  I knew immediately that I had to own it and share it with my daughter.  I have no idea if she will react to it the same way I did, but in a few days, I'll find out!<br /><br />I loved this book as a child soo much!  I would draw little imaginary scenes for hours; castles, dragons and skeletons for days!  I can't wait for it to arrive!  I'll have to check my daughter's supply of colored pencils...  :)
0977326403|5.0|This is the first honest look at how the social sectors are different from the private sector, and how the application of private sector thinking is NOT the answer to a great social sector organization. It address the perplexing issues of social sector metrics (measurement of progress), and comes to a very practical conclusion. It also examines other Good to Great concepts from a social sector perspective, including leadership, getting the right people on the bus, the Hedgehog principle, funding, and building the brand. This book has helped us completely refocus and redefine our organization, and it's paying huge dividends. And it's only 35 pages in length, so it doesn't take a lot of time to read it -- but it will generate hours of deep thinking on how to take your organization or government entity from good to great.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is another fabulous book from Hay House.  Good development of story and insight by Anita Moorjani.  Great inspiration.  I couldn't put it down.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Awsome book highly recommend reading great for all agesif you do read have a great time reading this great book
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This story is exciting. It takes twists and turns that you don't see coming. Shows you how different organizations can work as a family and what makes it successful for them. Love is stronger that anything and working together!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|The only thing i have say is i love it makes me sound like a man but i still love it
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|had to re read some of the prev. books to remember what was going on, but you can easily miss some pages and not be lost.  getting a little drawn out....and then it still isn't done?  How much can they really replay this????  Easy read to laying in the sun where you don't need much depth.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|It's good but I didn't like the voice actor's in the game other then that it's really fun to play just like the console version.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was putting off reading this because I didn't want it too end...and I don't know if I like the way it ended.  It really was a convoluted scheme, even considering the whole series. I have loved every book, this one..not so much. And Sam? Seriously...would've rather seen her turned...
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|WHY do we not have inventive story tellers like Nesbo in the US? Twists, turns roundabouts, reverses...he's a magician with words and plots. Order everything he's written!<br /><br />M. Massey, Sedona, AZ
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A wonderful story that makes me want to do more, see more and love more. I can't imagine anyone not having the ability to connect with this story and its characters.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|This is a fairy tale turned into an adult 'R&#34; rated movie.  I think teenagers would enjoy it.  Adults would probably tolerate it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game, it's great for kids and I love that for an adult it's super enjoyable too! There are some annoying ads but if you turn off your Internet they go away.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was SO swept up in &#34;The Hunger Games: Book One&#34;, I couldn't imagine it being topped. Boy was I wrong! &#34;Catching Fire&#34; is just as intense & suspenseful as &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;. Katniss, Peeta & the same great characters are back. Suzanne Collins has a way of fleshing characters out in a succinct & intelligent way, that still makes the reader feel for them. Highly recommended!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This weather app is one of the most accurate apps on the market! I love it! It works just the way I want it too. The only downside is that it doesn't refresh at the hours I want it too, but I'm just picky!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|There are probably other apps out there that do the same thing, but this is the only one I've tried.  It's fun!  You know when you hear a song, love it, want it, but can never find out the name/artist?  This will take care of that for you.  Easy to use.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Really, really hard in some parts.  There are slightly offensive parts, but welcome to the world of mainstream comedy.  I'd read it again :)
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|If you like to play MAhjong then you'll love this game. I can't get enough of it and  each picture you choose to play is a challenge in itself. Why not try it and give it a shot. THE PRICE IS RIGHT!!

0307730700|5.0|\\"Fearless\\", by Eric Blehm<br />About This Book<br />Fearless takes you deep into SEAL Team SIX, straight to the heart of one of its most legendary operators.<br /><br />\\"As a rule, we don't endorse books or movies or anything regarding the command where I work--and Adam Brown worked--but as the author writes in Fearless, `you have to know the rules, so you know when to bend or break them.' This is one of those times.  Read this book. Period. It succeeds where all the others have failed.\\"  --Anonymous SEAL Team SIX Operator<br /><br />When Navy SEAL Adam Brown woke up on March 17, 2010, he didn't know he would die that night in the Hind Kush Mountains of Afghanistan--but he was ready. In a letter to his children, not meant to be seen unless the worst happened, he wrote, \\"I'm not afraid of anything that might happen to me on this earth, because I know no matter what, nothing can take my spirit from me.\\"<br /><br />Fearless is the story of a man of extremes, whose courage and determination were fueled by faith, family, and the love of a woman. It's about a man who waged a war against his own worst impulses, including drug addiction, and persevered to reach the top tier of the U.S. military. In a deeply personal and absorbing chronicle, Fearless reveals a glimpse inside the SEAL Team SIX brotherhood, and presents an indelible portrait of a highly trained warrior whose final act of bravery led to the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />Adam Brown was a devoted man who was an unlikely hero but a true warrior, described by all who knew him as...fearless.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br />My first reaction after reading this book (without putting it down for a minute!) was to wish this book was required reading for all secondary education students.  To understand what someone has done to keep each of us free and safe is to read the story of Adam Brown.  His name is added to the list of many other brave people when defining the word \\"warrior\\".<br /><br />It's difficult to read a book when you know the ending.  Yet, it's very important to read the beginning and learn about Adam's life.  He will inspire our young people to not give up, even if their life is messed up.  Adam's parents never gave up on him.  His wife, Kelley, never gave up on him.  She deserves her own medal for the faith and courage and hope she had for her husband.<br /><br />I will give Fearless as a gift to many, as this is a story that deserves to be told again and again. My humble words of praise are so insignificant in comparison to the impact of this book and the story told within it's pages.  I realize how blessed I am to live in a country in which so many people have done much to give us freedom.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this book is a keeper and will stay on my favorites shelf, always.<br /><br />The writing skills and thorough research of author, Eric Blehm, deserve an enormous degree of gratitude and the title of \\"best-selling author\\".  Thank you, Eric.  Please keep writing stories of unsung heros.<br /><br /> \\"I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review\\"
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun and keeps the kid side of people going. I definitely suggest downloading this game. It runs pretty good.
B0070NSPCU|3.0|Nothing spectacular here, but an interesting read. Interesting premise, even though the author kept most of his plot rather vague.
1932735410|5.0|very nice to trade with your side, and I hope to do it again in future, wish you a very good luck
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun you will love it trust me. And it is more fun if you have friends on Facebook it will make it more fun and the competitiveness kicks in!
B003SPCYP8|5.0|This movie was so powerful, moving. Shah Rukh Khan is the best actor. He lives the story and connects with the audience in a way no one else can.<br />Mutiple themes in addition to family dynamic ones . Very relevant to world we all face today post 9-11.<br />I cried several times. I have a son with Aspbergers. This movie really touched me.
B00B4804Q2|4.0|This is a fun and high energy movie! Delivers high powered cars and insane driving stunts. Makes you want to continue with this movie franchise.
B0007VZ9DU|5.0|This was a movie I really enjoyed. I could sit down and watch this all day and I happened to be a fan of Robert DeNiro. Sharon Stone was excellent in her role because she really played her character well. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|great read......the war told thru interviews gives it an authentic feel.<br />Format is perfect for reading in e-reader or Kindle.
630542845X|1.0|I ordered this item and as soon as I received it I tried to play it. Found that it was in a format that cannot be played in the U.S. Could not get a refund as the sender claimed that the format was advertised on the Amazon web site. I had no idea that Amazon would offer a product that could not be used in the U.S. without a plain warning that it is the wrong format for this country.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I was really excited to start reading the book but I found it slow and not very interesting. It was a let down for me. I don't recommend this book.
B0059DQHHI|1.0|Too many subtitles.  If I have to read the subtitles, then I am not watching the movie and am missing out.  If I'm going to read, I'll just pick up a book.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|......however a lot like Sleeping with the enemy - the setting was beautiful which changed it up a little bit
B008WZHWCE|1.0|If I busy reading subtitles, then I'm not watching the movie.  I would rather pick up a book if I'm going to read.  I couldn't get through the movie.
B00797MB0O|3.0|I really didn't think this was such a great movie - it didn't keep my interest during the movie and just wasn't my cup of tea.  I actually think I fell asleep watching it on my iPad.<br />Can't say I hated it but I'm glad I didn't have to pay money to see it in a movie theater.
0425263908|5.0|This love story has went from a trilogy to series status. Book one set my hair on fire, the author took us on a journey that made you fall for the fire and dangerous passion and when it ended you were dying for more. Book two takes the reader to the edge trying and hoping Eva and Gideon can hold on to each other through the storms in their lives. Eva and her roommate will make you want to kick their but for being selfish soles. Gideon will keep a girl on the edge because of his dark side, but you can't help but to fall in love with him. Book three the author provides a few juicy bites but then takes the readers on a road trip of information but on the scenic route we still have questions. I hope the ending to this love story<br />will be worth having to buy the hardback copy of book 3. These three books will now join the shelf with fifty shades of Grey, and Fourty Shades of Pearl Trilogys.
B00BMT9SQA|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was funny most of the time and brought back memories of an old boyfriend who had a mother just like this one.<br />I would strongly recommend this movie to those who like comedy's - wish Barb Streisand would do more movies.  She really is clever.
0345803485|5.0|I enjoyed every page of this book and went on to buy the next 2..It was like being an observer in a life unknown....worth the time to read...obviously i am not alone in this since it sold millions of copies....
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Great game to keep your mind working matching the squares. The matches are colorful and this game is easy to learn.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game its just like subway surfers and temple run but even better!<br />this is a great app for kids who love the minions!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Great storyline and characters. The characters and work described by Craig Johnson are true to the law enforcement profession.  Looking forward to reading the entire series.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|Best fantasy/action movie i've seen in a long time. Jason Momoa is AMAZING as Conan. I am used to him playing Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones but I liked him even more as Conan because he actually speaks in English and has a really great voice. And it doesn't hurt that he has his shirt off during the entire movie. Yay!!!<br />I give it two thumbs up!!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is great with my morning coffee! Especially since one can customize what kind of news one wants. No trashy celeb news necessary.

B0050QV0RQ|4.0|Another great rpg  game from kotobuki solution..... the graphic is not that bad and the gameplay awesome to. The only thing is that it crashes all the time to me. I suggest you keep saving a lot especially when your done fighting the boss.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Enjoyed this movie with my son and grandsons. It was just right for what we like. Wizard of Oz has been a favorite since I was a little girl, so it was nice to see it from a different perspective.
0385495323|5.0|After having read Simon Singh's Fermat's Last Theorem and Big Bang it is inevitable that one would go on to read The Code Book too. As the name suggests the book is about the history and evolution of the science of encryption. Apart from being a difficult subject, cryptography can come across as boring and lackluster. But Simon Singh knows how to treat his audience well. The Code Book takes its reader on to a roller coaster ride in to the wonderland of cryptography. In the book Mr. Singh chronicles the development of the science of cryptography and crypt-analysis from the times of ancient Romans and Egyptians all the way to our current times and quantum cryptography. During the course he records all the important events and hallmarks in the history of cryptography. The effect cryptography has had on the lives, wars, liberty and the geopolitical landscape of our times is described in a revealing way.<br /><br />The Code Book begins with the Romans involvement with early forms of cryptography. Julius Caesar's secret military writings are discussed. It distinguishes between cryptography and crypt-analysis. It also elucidates the role of Arabs in the development of crypt-analysis and a few old methods of cipher analysis. It then goes on to discuss the clandestine plot of Mary queen of Scots to assassinate the British Queen Elizabeth. The assassination plot was deciphered by Queen Elizabeth and she had the former beheaded. At its climax, it moves on to the stage of world war 2 and a significant portion of the book is devoted to the developments concerning the deciphering of Germans' enigma codes. The efforts of Allen Turing and his contemporaries, on both sides, are worth reading.<br /><br />The author then brings right in to our very own era of so-called modern cryptography. Here the author discusses the evolution of various techniques such as RSA, PGP and public-key cryptography. The author also discusses various philosophical, ethical and moral issues concerning personal privacy in our times. In particular, the discussion on the trade-of between the level of personal privacy and the level of information gathering by the law enforcement agencies is discussed from the point of view of security.<br /><br />The final chapter concludes by speculating about the future of cryptography and discusses and analyses the potential of quantum cryptography. Here again the author has done a commendable effort to elucidate some of the intricate concepts in quantum physics, specially superposition, and to analyse their relevance with quantum computing and cryptography. Simon Singh has a very inspiring style of writing about popular science. All of his books are written with much lucidity and eloquence. The pace of the plot is fast while not compromising the fine details. A person who opens the book once and set's off to reading looses track of his/her diurnal chores, looses track of time and would find it hard to close the book before the last page is reached. Anyone who would read The Code Book would fall in love with cryptography.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|Its epic and hilarious! I don't think they could have made it any better. Danny Mcbride is so funny in this! I'm holding out hope for a sequel.
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|I am playing on a Samsung Galaxy S4 and continually crash into the whirlwind fans and thusly cannot complete any levels after 3.7. Please fix and I will rerate.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A wonderful and heartfelt story ! Such great characters. I will definitely look for more books by this great author.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|I like all of Kinsella's books, but this one is probably one of my favorites. There were a few moments that made me laugh out loud and the people in the room stared at me oddly.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|This song of course has great rhythm, and I like the vocals, unlike some people who've noted they don't. The melody is of course what makes this song and I can't help but think that they should release an instrumental version as an option, but it's not a big deal. I'd like both versions, personally.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Not a fun game . You have toput the ball you are shooting in place first. It should be where ever you tap that's where the ball should go. Don't like it glad it was free.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|A typical google search engine. I am satisfied it works as on any other device. I recommend if searching on the Kindle Fire is something you want to do.
1594481717|4.0|Wonderful research into right brain importance<br />Great for parent evening presentations<br />Waldorf Education has understood the importance of right brain development for many years already
B0063IH60K|4.0|Typically solitaire application - nothing special really - but it works well and can be easily accessed. I recommend this application
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I've tried a few of the 9 experiments, and to my surprise, i got results.  I'm currently doing another one.  I still have 36 hours left of it, but since the others worked, I'm  sure this one will too.  My favorite is the &#34;Einstein sticks&#34; experiment.  I've shared it with my grand kids, and they too, are wowed!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|The application works - however - the kindle is not user friendly to take pics or videos really with only a one way front facing eye it is very difficult to film anything but yourself. Its unfortunate. I suppose the application is not bad, but the device limits the possibilities. I would not recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You can not predict how the book will bring in the ending. It was very exciting to read. Every minute of my time. for the last few days I have been reading. The ending is going to be very exciting and unexpected. A really good book.

B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I've only been playing this game for a few days but, so far I'm really enjoying it! The monkeys and their environment are really cute! So far it's not to difficult.

B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|If you are into scary movies you should defiantly watch this one. It could give you some nightmares so be sure and sleep with your blankie at night.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Found this book to be light and charming, with a surprising twist.  Markedly different from other books with a similar premise.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The music to the game is so relaxing, sometimes I just put it on just to hear the soundtrack. I feel like I have my very own digital aquarium.
B000HKYA1I|5.0|This movie is a well-kept secret and quirky treasure.  “Everything is Illuminated” came out of nowhere and stole my heart.  I liked it so much that I watched it all the way through a second time, less than a week after my first viewing – something I only do for exceptional movies, when there are so many other things to watch.  Directed by Liev Schreiber, the movie came out in 2005, and is based on a book of the same name by Brooklyn-based author Jonathan Safran Foer. I found the movie after reading a non-fiction book on a totally different subject by Safran that knocked my socks off.  I searched Amazon to see what else this creative genius had done, since his writing and his mind are exceptional. What struck me so much about Safran’s work was that he has a rare talent for luring us into very “difficult” subjects by disarming us with humor.  I feel I needed to say that first, because otherwise, it would be almost impossible to explain that this is a Holocaust-related film that is both poignant and laugh-out-loud funny.<br />I cannot comment on differences between the novel and movie, as other reviewers have, because I stumbled across the movie without having read the book.  But what Liev Schreiber has done with this story is so remarkable that any handwringing about its faithfulness to the novel might be irrelevant.  Sometimes two minds are better than one, and this movie truly works.  Let’s make that “soars” – this is not a workhorse translation of book to movie – it’s more of a collaborative metamorphosis. Indeed, the mind-meld between Safran and Schreiber to make this movie cannot have been less awkward than the movie-story’s collaboration between the two oddball main characters.  (They share the stage so completely, that it’s not possible to say which is the real protagonist.) The story follows the “odd couple” of Elijah Wood as seriously near-sighted, urban Jewish vegetarian Jonathan—on a “heritage” tour to find evidence ofthe woman who saved his grandfather, and Eugene Hutz as “Alex,” the Ukrainian “premium dancer” who has to make ends meet by conducting tours for “rich Jews” who want to find their dead ancestors.<br /> Much of the allure of this movie stems from the playful way it uses “translation” to make us crack up laughing while pondering the reasons why different cultures use language so differently.  Since the narrator is the Ukrainian Alex, you hear that they are on a “seriously rigid search” for Jonathan’s family’s past.  As you get into the swing of Alex’s translation, you will find yourself captivated by the ways that translation affects thought.<br /> The dog in the movie is also a scene-stealer, and the dog’s namesake and personality are interesting highlights of the story.<br />I cannot end this review without also addressing the serious and tragic underpinnings for the story.  As we watched the movie, my husband and I realized that the germ of the story may have come from the sad World War II events in the beleaguered Ukrainian town of Lviv.  I did not hear the town’s name mentioned in the movie, but my husband spotted one train-station-related clue in the film scenery, suggesting that Lviv was an inspiration.  (I won’t spoil it – see if you can find it.)<br />Approach this movie with an open mind – it does not fit in any typical film genre, and kudos to its makers for that.  It has elements of such disparate genres that it would seem almost schizophrenic to use these “bins” to tag or categorize the movie.  Imagine a file clerk, in the old days, who would have to decide how to file “Humor-Tragedy.”  Or “Off-Beat Holocaust.”  There are elements in the story, such as a tiny cottage in the middle of a hundred acres of sunflowers, that I can only categorize as “Magical Realism,” but the movie is very direct, not fanciful. All I can say is that everyone has heard the phrase “laugh so hard you cry.”  Well, I come awayfrom everything Jonathan Safran Foer is associated with thinking that I “cried so hard I laughed.”  Oy, I know that sounds insane.  Become familiar with Safran Foer’s work and you will know.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest things I have ever bought. It is the swiss army knife of nostalgia and awesomeness... writing this review is taking time away from the memories so i'm going to stop here.

Too full of herself.<br />Yet I will  adopt  Terry.<br />Thank you for  sharing your story with us.<br />I actually had to fire her as a client and I think you should too.<br />A Santa  fe  resident.
B006CHML4I|5.0|This was a really good purchase.  sporty and cool, while comfortable and water-resistant.  Wore it in pool for hours while playing with kids - takes a licking and keeps on ticking (oh, wait, that's a different brand).
B00AHTYI5M|1.0|So once upon a time, Ben Affleck, along with Matt Damon, won an Oscar for  Best Original Screenplay for \\"Good Will Hunting.\\"  That was light years ago.  Now Affleck's abysmally terrible movie \\"Argo\\" has won the Oscar for Best Picture.  \\"Good Will Hunting\\" was a decent movie, I guess, but \\"Argo\\" is the most boring, misleading, inaccurate piece of lame, leftist propaganda ever to come down the pike.  How it ever beat out ANY of the other movies in the Best Picture category is beyond me.  Somebody with deep pockets must have purchased that gold statuette -- there's no other way to explain it.  Affleck and his other liberal, left-wing pal, George Clooney, were producers of this clunker, made worse by Affleck's catatonic acting.  I am old enough to remember the actual events depicted in the film, and even as fiction, this movie bites.  Nowhere near what really happened, which would be fine except that Affleck himself tried to use its historical basis as some sort of selling point.  Even worse were Affleck's comments about this film (as quoted in The Hollywood Reporter):  \\"And it's the same regime, it was Khomeni, now it's Khamenei -- there's still this Islamist, this Stalinist regime, and that makes me sad. That makes me feel like, yeah, we had this wonderful thing that happened in our movie, where America really did something right, but that we haven't figured out how to navigate our relationship with countries in the Middle East.\\"  Dear Mr. Affleck:  You are just an actor.  You are not a statesman or an ambassador or a politician or a world leader -- who really gives a rip what you perceive to be our problems in the Middle East?  Bottom line, this movie is rotten film in and of itself.  It's even worse as a political statement, which Affleck clearly intended it to be.  Nauseating.  Don't waste one cent of your money or one second of your time on this trash.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Exciting and titillating. JE knows how to set a scene and deliver the images of New Jersey life. Only occasionally predictable.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I love this series.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  The first season is just a LITTLE on the slower side as it is building the story lines, but after that you won't want to stop watching.  The series ends with a beautiful ending, much unlike a lot of series out there.  This is a great gift and good investment of your time.  Worth the watch!!!!!!
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|I loved Pacific Rim, what's not to like about Giant Robots battling Kaiju, or Giant Monsters?  So, I had to buy the soundtrack.  The music is great, perfect background for both the Jaegers and Kaiju! Highly recommended!
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|She manages to sum up the whole series in one very compelling book really enjoyed it, you kind of know where it is going to go but then get a curve ball... was gripped to the last page.

B00422LESO|5.0|Read a few of Shannon Hale's books before, but never even heard of this one! My husband showed me the trailer to the movie saying &#34;I want to take you to this movie.&#34; Rolling my eyes (because our taste in movies are quite opposite) I watched with a dropped Jaw. I LOVE Pride and Prejudice! This is what happens when you wish your dreams were real...I have my Darcy though :-)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the fact that your have to be on your toes to remember all the clues that you find and where they go.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I am unimpressed with this new version. I enjoyed the simplicity of the former one. Now I have to search numerous screens to find the information I want. The maps,however, are a nice addition.
B00AVFO41K|2.0|Confusing and difficult to win. No directions come with the game so I'm not sure how your suppose to figure it all out
B0097K21YW|5.0|Similar to ones with birds and pigs, the idea is to launch projectiles at targets, taking into account gravity, wind, type of projectile, etc.<br />Fun, the goals are achievable - especially for free, this is another winner.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The movie was all right but the video feed was no good. The movie stopped at least 5 times. I would never reccomdend it spending your money.
B000I186FW|4.0|Excellent performance by Natalie, who is one of my very favorite actors. Storyline kept me hooked throughout. Big thumbs up!
B002XWXPC8|5.0|I liked this movie a lot, and I don't think it has lost much of its punch over the years.I may be biased because I am an Indians fan.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|A couple of my friends recommended this flick. Don't know why!! &#34;Oh, its a metaphor..&#34; Well, it's a DUMB metaphor -- doesn't make sense. Visually it's great, acting is solid, but the story is silly/weak!!
0452273331|5.0|I won't go into writing a complete book summary of The Fountainhead. I will just say that it is in my Top 5 Books list. I had read Atlas Shrugged, loved it but thought the long diatribes on objectivism were over the top. The Fountainhead has an enthralling plot and some of the strongest characters you will ever encounter in literature without too many lectures from the characters on objectivism. Many famous people list FH as an influential book in their lives (do a google search). Couldn't put it down. Gives one plenty to think about in this era of government being out of control.
