B0090SI582|5.0|Hugh Jackman & Company get it right and deliver it all so well with this movie.  They've stayed true to who Wolverine is as a character and incorporate just the right balance of extreme action with surprising plot twists & turns that keep you guessing.  I anticipated being disappointed with the train sequence b/c we had just seen an extremely well done 'fighting on a train' scene in one of the earlier Spiderman movies - but they did it well enough in this movie that it didn't matter.  In the wrong hands, Wolverine could be as flat as Superman was in the most recent iteration of that franchise.  But Hugh is able to find the various shades of humanity within his character and express it in this film--there is humor here, depression, loneliness, nobility, guilt, the hope for redemption and FUN.  I have no idea why people feel obligated to trash Origins-- that movie was also great.
0765357151|4.0|Quality was pretty good, some writing on the very back, not covering any words though. I was disappointed that the cover of the book was not the same one that was depicted, but I can't complain. 4/5

B00479SVBU|5.0|Since my car's CD player does not work and there is no cassette deck or AUX input, I am bound to using FM Transmitters for listening to music. Typically I have to replace my FM Transmitters yearly because I buy cheap ones from Wal-Mart, Rite Aid, etc. This time I opted to pay a little bit more and the difference is unbelievable. Since I took the antenna off my car (I never listen to the radio), I don't really have any problems with static on any station. This too is true for the cheap FM Transmitters I bought in the past. However, the sound that the Soundfly AUX pumps out is so much more clear and has so much more bass than the cheaper ones. I have only used the Soundfly AUX with a 4gb SD card, so cannot attest to the quality of the USB or 3.55mm cable functions. The only downside I can note, like other customers, is that the device does not adjust sideways, only up and down, which would help since my cigarette lighter is on the passenger side. Other than that, sometimes when I accelerate a whining noise from my engine gets picked up by the FM broadcast and plays through the speakers. However, I do not think this is the fault of the Soundfly AUX as I have had  the same problem with all FM transmitters. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone in need of an FM Transmitter. Giving it 5 stars and will leave it as such unless the device fails within two years.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Hours of fun.  I love dinosaurs and the jurassic park movies this game encompasses it all thank you for a great game
B009KS4XRO|2.0|First off let me say that the game itself is not horrible. What is not good is that it is very difficult to win and I have yet to understand how someone bingos after only three numbers are called. The REALLY BIG COMPLAINT is that when you spend money on coins and the app freezes you seem to be pretty much out of luck. I have contacted the makers and sent them the info they ask for and then NEVER got my credits. This is very unprofessional of them. I do still play it but I no longer spend the amount of time I used to playing because I REFUSE to purchase more coin packs to get ripped off with when the app freezes. Proceed with caution when doing an in app purchase. Otherwise have fun it really is a pretty good game. Just wish I would have read the other reviews who have had the same issues first before buying in app.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's simply great and free, what more can you ask for!! I would suggest to download. You get to play with others and also send each other gifts while playing, it's pretty cool!!

B00D7NRHX0|4.0|it was an okay movie kind of strange in a way on how one planet looked down on the other one but I did like the way it ended
B001LF3YQK|5.0|We use this all the time with wipes for our baby. Beats having to open a case and having them all fall out when trying to clean our baby. Simply slide the red cap back and pull of the wipe and everything else stays in. :)
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very good game. It has an interesting story line and the graphics are very well done. The puzzles are not so hard they are frustrating but not so easy to be boring. Good balance. I would recommend it.

0062255657|4.0|Neil Gaiman's new novel \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" explores the fabric of memory in such a way as to equate it with myth and legend.  Gaiman's writing, which I would characterize as a cross between Tim Burton and Alice Hoffman, is always rich with color, texture, scent and sound, but more to the point, he has the ability to weave a new story which feels like an ancient myth.  In this book, a man returns to his childhood home to discover his house has been torn down.  Resting at a neighbor's house, he begins to remember spectacular events which occurred there during a night when he was about seven years old.  Like Gaiman's other work, The Graveyard Book, his has the ability to tell a  sophisticated  story through a young boy very convincingly.  Down the lane from his home lives three extraordinary women: Letty, Ginny, and Old Mrs Hempstock, who live a simple farm life, but are capable of miraculous acts.  Old Mrs. Hemptock keeps the full moon hanging over the south side of the house because she likes its light, Letty can carry the ocean in a bucket, and Ginny can sew a rent in the fabric of time.  When a being from another world is accidentally carried into this world and threatens the young hero, Lettie vows to protect him, no matter what.  The fantastical creatures Gaiman imagines are terrible in strange and unexpected ways, yet equally horrific are the events unleashed in the every day world.  The Hempstock women  have the ability to erase events by simply snipping them out of the fabric of an old dressing gown, and likewise can erase bad memories not unlike a scene from Star Wars-\\"Nothing to see here...\\"  and suggests an alternate truth. They thereby change memory, not reality.  Or do they?  I confess I do not think I understood all the meanings within this tale, but was able to enjoy it on its most basic level as a good story.

B009K72G8I|5.0|they are all into star wars and with the episodes they never get tired of watching the same movie over and over again
0061474355|4.0|I'm ultimately mixed as to what my overall official opinion is for this book. I liked it, but it wasn't as fantastic as I'd hoped it would be. This might be because the book has a strong \\"high fantasy\\" feel to it, which is a genre that I don't generally read. However I can see that the book is exceedingly well written and has \\"Future Hollywood Blockbuster\\" written all over it.<br /><br />Now despite how extensive the world is, the story here isn't actually that deep. By that I mean that the story is fairly straight forward and doesn't really delve that deeply into the whys and wherefores of everything. This works for and against the book at points. It helps give everything a nice feeling of urgency and pacing, but at the same time it left me with more questions than answers. Everything here is well self-contained and explained decently enough, so readers shouldn't feel too overly confused or lost as they read through Sabriel's adventures.<br /><br />I have to say that the descriptions are probably the strongest parts of this. I didn't really feel the huge chemistry between Sabriel and Touchstone, but everything else was so well described that I couldn't help but keep reading. I think my favorite example of this would be the crew passing under the huge chain at Belis Mouth. You get this sense of this massive chain and the feeling of how it'd be to pass under something so huge and mysterious. If/when this ever gets made into a movie, it's one of the scenes I'd most like to see.<br /><br />Overall I can see why this is a favorite of so many people and I've already decided that I'll pass this book on to my eldest nephew. It's the type of thing he'd really love, assuming he hasn't read it already. I liked the overall story well enough that I'll try starting on the next book in the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|That was the best series.  I can hardly wait until season 4. I spent the whole day watching season 3.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|To all you people out there who cant get there 2 year old to figure out the game,  guess what? Kids at their age still need to learn the basics of life (aka physics)  to figure out this game. If you have any questions about any other Rovio games email me at ccostello@stny.rr.com
B000W93CHC|5.0|In the style of the original Pillars book, this is long and intriguing. I'm an avid reader, and frankly, I couldn't put this one down.<br />It had a reasonable amount of characters, and wove their lives and stories back and forth in a way that the reader can relate to, and keep track of, with lots of twists and turns to keep the plot interesting, and a satisfying ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and exciting and then at the same time so aggervating at times.  I am stuck in a room right now and have no idea where to get help.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Hm....I will be chastised by every zombie nerd who has read this, but I just couldn't get into it.  The theory of the book is cool, but that was out of the box before the end of the first chapter, and all the rest was redundant.<br />I love to read intelligent books, and this is one, but I just couldn't get into it, and was glad when I finished it.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I have owned this concert on VHS for at least 15 years and have probably watched it over 100 times and it is easily the best concert video I have ever seen. The band is flawless. Being a guitar player myself, Gilmour's work displayed here is utterly amazing. The tone, timing, texture, touch, precision are all perfect for these songs. Sure, if I had my perfect Pink Floyd playlist I could point out 15 more songs I wish were included...but even the songs that aren't old classics have grown on me and I know every single guitar note and word now and play them all day in my head. It's a great concert to sit and watch, or just put it on as background music while you do stuff around the house. Currently I've been watching portions of this concert while on the treadmill every morning and it just hit me how much of an effect this show has had on my life so I wanted to add a review on here.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel was the first fantasy novel I ever read, and even now, over a decade later, it is still my favorite. In this book and its trilogy Garth Nix has written some of my favorite characters (Mogget!) and created a wonderful and rich world. His awe-inspring descriptions of some of the places in the Old Kingdom (and beyond?) stay with me to this day.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to fantasy-lovers, young-adult readers, and (especially!) to young women for the fantastic portrayal of a young woman who puts evil back in its place (not because she is a woman, or in spite of it, but just because she's a strong and amazing person). This was also the first novel I ever read with a strong female protagonist, and I remember being so excited and happy about *finally* reading a book about a girl! Who's tough! Like me! That was a wonderful feeling.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy, although Mockingjay was very melancholy to me. But, an appropriate ending to an extremely good story.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Collins comes up with an outrageously good story - a real twist on &#34;two champions fighting and the winner takes all&#34; This is more of a dark tale, and I couldn't help thinking about the Diary of Anne Frank while I was reading this.

1885167776|4.0|I read an awesome book - \\"The One Thing - The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results\\" by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan.<br /><br />So the gist of the book is very simple.  Focus wins.<br /><br />Of course I have a problem with focus.  I tend to juggle lots of balls.  But then I started to think - perhaps part of it for me is definition.  EG - perhaps I do focus a lot on business even though that means doing a lot of things on different companies.<br /><br />He talks about the well known myth of multitasking.<br /><br />He also had a chapter on the Disciplined Life (the message is it is not discipline that you need - it is good habits).<br /><br />He has a chapter on the 4 thieves of productivity.  I agree with 3 of them:<br /><br />1 - Inability to say \\"no\\".  (I really try but often still say yes in times of weakness)<br /><br />2 - Fear of Chaos. (this is the one I am not sure I agree with.  Order really helps productivity.  I greatly dislike not being able to find something. Being organized helps me focus on the important.  Of course I liked that this was one of the thieves though since it made me feel a bit better about some of the things in my life that feel disorganized.  I do agree that over organized or over cleaned compulsiveness would not help productivity.)<br /><br />3 - Poor Health Habits<br /><br />4 - Environment Doesn't support your goals.  (We all know how important environment is.  In this chapter he speaks of \\"choose your friends and who you spend time with\\")<br /><br />It really is a great book.  Lots of research that support the conclusions.
0062014536|5.0|That last book in a trilogy. Many of the YA dystopian trilogies that appeared right after the dystopian boom are coming to a close. Lauren Oliver started this trilogy with such an interesting concept. Love is a disease, a disease that must be eradicated. Many of the YA trilogies out there have forced love triangles, but love as a concept is integral to this series. The relationships make sense.<br /><br />The first half of Delirium didn't really do it for me, but the second half really dragged me in. When Pandemonium came around, I was hooked immediately. I loved the second book in this trilogy. Perspective and timeline were played with in such an interesting way. Lauren Oliver continued to play with perspective in this third book, Requiem.<br /><br />Requiem is from the perspective of Lena and Hana. Lena has been the main character the whole trilogy, but we haven't heard much of Hana since the first book. At the start of this book, Hana's story drew me in a lot more than Lena's. Hana's story got better, but Lena's story was the highlight of the book for me.<br /><br />The side characters in this trilogy are all very interesting and the novellas that take place in the same universe give so many more details into the characters. I really enjoyed the character of Lucian in this novel. I found Alex annoying. And, Fred was just super creepy (almost Joffreylike).<br /><br />By the end of the novel, the two storylines come together perfectly. The end was done so well. It was a great culmination of the trilogy. I especially liked that there was not an epilogue delivered in a nice pretty bow like The Hunger Games or Harry Potter. I give this book a 5/5!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this trilogy! Unlike many other trilogies, it only gets better. This third book was the best and the companion novellas are amazing as well!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I didn't care for this book. I don't know if I believe his story. Maybe it is because I have never heard of a Death experience described like this. Plus no one to verify his facts. Plus way too much detail & scientific jargon. I was in the medical field & I skipped over those parts because they were complicated & boring.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Fun app and makes you think. Good probl solving skills are being built. Great free app and passes the time.
0425267695|5.0|From the opening pages to the closing paragraph, this is one of the best fantasy novels I have read.  The images the author painted remain long after the book is finished. Almost none of that 'fill the pages' fluff of self-debate and multi-page descriptions of clothing you get from other writers.<br /><br />From the very beginning you are pulled into the life story of an enigmatic man.  The author does a superb job of blending the story as the hero tells it to an Imperial historian and the real story he plays through his mind, while on a sailing vessel to his presumed doom.  You're constantly getting 'the rest of the story' moments though the book.  I won't give examples (why spoil the fun?) but they're there if you're paying attention while you read this man's story.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that has you screaming for a sequel, even when you know there is no way it can be as good as the first book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Had to reload on kindle because it froze and would not load. After 5 attempts finally got it working again. Still play and love it. Have family and friends hooked as well.

0062513346|2.0|Best known for the globally renowned classic The Alchemist (1988), Coelho is fascinated by the battle between forces of light and darkness that operates outside of the realm of traditional ethical codes.  In contrast, this is very traditional indeed, as a quite literal rendition of Joseph Campbell's monomyth with all of the typical elements: the call to action, trials, supernatural helpers, and the completed task. Coelho is assigned by his teacher the task of speaking with his guardian angel, and he dutifully departs with his wife to the Mojave Desert to initiate contact. After a bout with severe dehydration, Coelho's desert retreat is characterized by \\"encounters with strange men and beautiful women, all with an aura of enormous vibrating sensuality.\\" Primary among these is Valhalla, a leather-clad ex-banker and fellow member of the same secret society of magi. She leads a band of desert sirens on horseback. Valhalla teaches Coelho a few choice spiritual truths, which gives rise to a subplot in which he becomes torn by passion for her and love for his wife, which the two women resolve in a peculiar spiritual combat at the end of an absurdly theatrical Ritual to End All Rituals. This is one of Coelho's more forgettable titles.
B00E8B1358|3.0|While this is a decent flick, it has lost some of the strong players from the first movie and &#34;the Rock&#34; is not as good an actor as prior participants.  Bruce Willis' role is minimal.

B0042816YK|5.0|What more can I say?  This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I also read the book, and the movie definitely lived up to it.
0064471837|5.0|Originally having read this in Middle School, I was fascinated by the singularly original world Nix had created that centered on strong female leads. He doesn't overdo the power and the grandeur of magic; in fact, it's the subtlety of the world and how it all slowly emerges for both you and the protagonist that is the most beautiful part of this trilogy for me. The author approaches his reader elegantly rather than steam rolling him with gratuitous and illogical action, violence, and romance in 15 page cycles. Instead, Nix uses real substance and mystery to keep you breathlessly turning the page. There's definitely the beautiful spectacle of fantasy about this book, and I frequently enjoyed the tactile descriptions that Nix uses to describe magic, for example its metallic taste. I highly recommend you choose this book and wander with Sabriel, and eventually Lirael, through their dark and beautiful world. I don't have much time to reread the same books over and over, but this is one of the only books, and the only trilogy, I have ever read three times!

B0034JKZ86|5.0|Great animated film. I love the (mostly) traditional looking animation and 1920's New Orleans jazz inspired soundtrack. A few reviewers have said parts were too scary for their kids. My daughter was 3 years old when she watched this the first time and she wasn't scared, at all.<br /><br />The picture and sound are very good for DVD, which is typical for a Disney release. There aren't many special features but most likely your kids will just want to watch this over and over.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This one actually almost has a plot.  The acting is average. It is not a movie that I would like to see more than once.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I feel this is the most underrated of the prequels. While I don't believe its as good as the classics, I think it's better than episode 2 and 3.

B00621E94E|5.0|By far one of the most outstanding tv series ever to excist. this is up there with hero's, star trek, farscape....if you like thriller/action with a little sciFi/fantasy thrown in. this is an absolute gem.<br /><br />A MUST SEE !!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I am totally addicted to it. I LOVE the minions, and I am so happy they made a game about them!! Would give higher rating if possible!!! It is  well made, and u can tell that whoever made this put some effort into it:)
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I saw the second Despicable me and I had to have this. I am now obsessed with little minions. I will trade with this person again.
B00BMKDTNC|1.0|This book was fantastic. Right up until it just ended a abruptly. There were HUGE story lines left open and literally NOTHING had resolution other than the last battle.  As much as I have loved this series I would take back reading it due to the fact that there manage to be 14 books, well over 10,000 pages I'm sure and yet cannot manage ANY closure. It was ridiculous.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Thought this book was a good read, but I got really confused in who characters were and what the origins of most of the characters
B0035G04TI|4.0|Really learned a lot from this book about how to speak a woman's love language. Everyone, single or married should read this book.
B009CG1YZ8|5.0|Bruce Campbell's finest performance!  Excellent in HD and worth it!<br />I wish the new Evil Dead had the same style as the original series!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I've used it for years on Kindle happily being notified when I received email, but now it won't push notifications and won't update the inbox. I have resorted to using the browser to view email. I thought this was the new Fire software, but not sure. Loved the old Fire, they've ruined it. Nothing works right.
B003OPUZYY|5.0|I love this! I love Alvin Lee and TYA. Awesome music. A must for all fans.  A wonderful chronology of all their albums.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|An awesome game for kids and adults! No lag or problems with it whatsoever. Very entertaining. I actually can't stop playing!
B005WBBYXO|2.0|Well I can tell from reading other bad reviews that I'm going to have a lot of people who feel compelled to say this wasn't helpful. Apparently there are a lot of agendas out there, and seeing the name \\"VirtualGrace\\" is going to make some ignorant people draw stupid conclusions. However, anyone having only read: Northern Lights/The Golden Compass, is going to think I'm crazy rating this so low- just as I did when I was reading bad reviews.<br /><br />There are a few amazing authors who can tap into something special and craft a book that details a reality that is so... 'true' that you simply know it has existed at one point in time. Such was Northern Lights. It was an epic adventure that was completely and breathtakingly captivating. It took me away from my own world with it's 'realness'. There was not one discordant note for me. It was like reading the story of a life you lived and feeling all the time, \\"I remember this\\", or \\"I just know that was the way it all happened\\". It was real.<br /><br />I was excited to read the following two books, but once begun, I realized it was a terrible mistake. The entire 'tone' of the sequels was discordant. It was like someone rushing through to meet a deadline and throwing out chapters filled with the expected level of 'excitement'. It had a frenzied, hurried, fabricated feel to it that left the impression of a \\"kaleidoscopic discontinuity\\" where jumbled images came together in senseless configurations to form pictures. I know that sounds strange but I am struggling to give words to my impression.<br /><br />Now I don't mind that Phil decided to turn an amazing children's book into religious and political propaganda about the dethroning of 'God', (an ancient and decaying angel driven mad and senile by age) and the destruction of the \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", (a war machine built like a giant mountain). What I do mind was the feeling that the amazing direction Northern Lights began, came to a shrieking and painful halt, and somethingcheap and artificial was put in it's place. I mind that the whole tone of the original book was changed. Instead of an epic story that poignantly played on the reader's emotions, you had a hurried, rushed cacophony of events jumbled together. It was very much like those dreams where there is so much that is happening that you can't pause for breath and wake up feeling exhausted and confused. I very much disliked how Asriel had almost nothing to do with the downfall of God. That \\"His Dark Materials\\" didn't include the aliethiometer, or the amber spyglass, or the subtle knife- he didn't use any of them! I disliked the fact that the author felt compelled to bring all the original characters back (even from the dead) from the first book and plot them in the sequels like rootings in a garden. I especially didn't like the Afterlife, where endless spirits go to sit and do nothing for eternity, never to be reunited with their daemons, or a hideous, muck-encrusted, stinky harpy that suddenly saves Lyra from falling into Oblivion and is then named \\"Gracious Wings\\" by Lrya (how trite!). But what horrified me the most was the lack of integrity towards his characters. Now, suddenly Mrs. Coulter, the grasping, ambitious, selfish, ruthless woman who tore children apart in the first book, becomes this gentle, loving mother who, with Lord Asriel, (a selfish, hellbent man who thought nothing of his child, murdering a young boy to open the gateway, or anything else) throw themselves into Oblivion to destroy the figurehead of the Kingdom of Heaven, (an angel who could just fly the heck out of there once they fall asleep and let go) to save their daughter. Forget the fact that he was just a figurehead and had an entire army at his disposal who could carry on without him. Apparently this senseless and ridiculous sacrifice will somehow save their daughter, whom neither gave a thought to in her life!!! Add in miniature people who ride on dragonflies, horse-like people with elephant trunksand six legs that ride on wheels and look like motorcycles, and homosexual angels, and you've got such a mesh-mashed conglomeration of nonsense that it completely invalidated the extraordinary first book. Lastly, the temptation of 'Eve'/ Lyra, was never really explained, unless it was when the author was depicting two children falling in love and getting frisky under some trees. I personally don't want to read about 12 year olds falling in love and kissing and wanting to lie together- thank you very much!<br /><br />In short, while I praise Northern Lights to the highest degree, (10 stars out of 5 at least!), the sequels wouldn't rate 1 star and this was a fantastic waste of money, and a massive disappointment and disillusionment of an epic scale.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book it the epitome of a great science fiction piece of work.  I have read the book several time after years apart and it still holds up.  If you enjoy reading science fiction then you should not hesitate to buy this book.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Very well written, this author is very talented. I enjoyed the story, but the use of words in scenes and generating visual images was excellent.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I had no expectations for this film before watching it and found it to be surprisingly good. We watched it on a lark after another option turned out to not be available via streaming.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman aren't the best singers, which made the movie painful to watch at times, but the timeless and moving story and the other actors and singers, especially Anne Hathaway, managed to save the movie and make it worth watching.  Although I had seen the stage play and knew the story well, the movie brought the story to life in a whole new way.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|There was no end to the number of ridiculous crap this movie did poorly. About what I expected, but it made for many laughs.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|This story was a good read of love and hope and about loss. But, there were many sexual scenes in the book which I was not fond of. I would have given this book a five star, if it wasn't for those hurendous sexual scenes.
B0044C3RB4|3.0|I was very impressed with a show being able to successfully blend Sci-Fi and Chick Drama into an interesting show, until it just begins to drag on... but it's inevitable I suppose.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|helps improve logical thinking and deductive reasoning.  good mental exercise.  recommended for keeping sharp in a fun way.  more levels would be nice.
1781162646|5.0|I LOVED this book.  Anyone who thinks Stephen King only writes horror, simply must read this book.  The story is engaging, with just enough of the supernatural to make it intriguing without going over the top. The characters truly lived on for me long after I finished reading it.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I enjoyed this installment in the series of movies based on Tolkien's books.  It defined elements of the other world of Hobbits and Goblins, Dwarves and Trolls, Wizards and traitors.  Beautifully shot, it is fun to watch, humorous and creative.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Love Cirque Du Soleil and watching this video reminds me why.  The price & delivery were great!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This well-written spy thriller is full of believable surprises and keeps me in doubt about every character's veracity and ulterior motives.  I couldn't be happier!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Recommended to me by a friend who knows how much I love my dog.... This is a wonderful story about strength of character and being true to yourself. Highly recommended.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|Great film, I had been wanting to watch it for a long time, but never got around it. Amazon was also great about automatically offering me a refund for \\"playback issues\\".
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|It seems that this game has received a lot of mediocre reviews.  However, I found it to be interesting and challenging.  I gravitate toward word games so factoryballs was definitely a different kind of fun for me.  I have completed most of the levels... I have about 4 more to go.  I wish that you could skip a level and come back to it later.  Sometimes you are just &#34;stuck.&#34;  But anyway, I think this game is unique and interesting.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good read and very interesting subject matter.  I have read a lot of the reviews and am very surprised that I saw any bad ones at all.  Maybe they didn't have kids!  Although I was surprised by the father's (Andy)actions, I blamed that on being a man.  Probably too simple.  Andy seemed under-emotional as much as Laurie (mother) seemed over-emotional.  I related to the mother.<br /><br />The story is about the brutal murder of a 14 year old boy and the actions of the family of the accused, a schoolmate of the dead boy and son of the ADA.  It explores the family dynamics, their love for one another, and the lies told by Andy, the father, by omission. That eventually lead to complete distrust of him and their son by his wife.  The most important message in this book is whether nature or nurture is the determining factor in raising children to be good people. As the mother of two grown sons, I thought about their genetic makeup a lot as my sons became men. I think most parents will find this story intriguing.
B004GTLFNW|4.0|I've been working out for over 30 years: from weights to ultra marathons to bike racing. A couple of years ago, my back went south, way south. I ended up needing a spinal fusion. Since then, I've been focusing more on strength training and trying to honor the second chance I've been given by not beating myself to death with ultra endurance pursuits.<br /><br />I really like the way the workouts are structured in this book. I believe in Lauren's philosophy, for the most part, but I still gotta have my aerobic fix. I also think the iPad app rocks! Get it and the book.<br /><br />I teach PE to incarcerated adults, and I adapt these workouts for use in the correctional facility where I work. All in all I think Lauren has created a versatile and varied system that produces results.<br /><br />One thing that should be included is a warm-up for the workouts. Lauren really doesn't address this in either the book or the app.
174179918X|1.0|I got lost on the subway system because Lonely Planet didn't bother to revise their subway map.  South Korea is known for it's efficiency but I doubt if they could build an entirely new subway line [#9] in less time that it takes Lonely Planet to print a map.<br /><br />To call this a 2013 edition is an outright lie.  I realize it is easier and cheaper to reprint the 2012 [or earlier] book and just change the date on it but then the book is outdated and you pretend you have actually revise it.<br /><br />Shame on Lonely Planet.
B001BR3P3U|5.0|This movie has great acting work done by Dan Arkyrod and John Belushi. This movie is still great even compared to today's movies.
B006H5120E|5.0|I loved the original version of this movie.  Watching it in 3D made it even better.  We used our PS3 connected to our 3D Vizio.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awsome but it gets hard when u faster it hard to keep up but its fun so kids that haven't plays your up for treat
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Worth seeing at the house with a beer and popcorn. It's a must to look at previous movies to get the story straight... Nice Effects... Simple Story ... 6/10
B000002KDO|5.0|brings back a lot of memories, this was my music when I was young. If you like black sabbath you'll love this one.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Thank you for writing something that is truthful. We need more to poke at themselves and make us feel like we are all the same. Forget what alter universe you live in. We are all the same and have the same struggles.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Been playing it little bit at a time over the past few days and am still not halfway through. It's got a lot of fun puzzles with some diversity. Nothing is really too hard. Great diversion.
B00AEFY44Y|4.0|Better than just ok.  The scene with the potter's wheel is the most memorable, sexy and touching at the same time.
B006INDS0W|5.0|What a fabulous film.  I've watched it 4 times now ... and I'm ready for my 5th.<br />The topic hit a nerve with me since my mother's entire family was wiped out in<br />Holland during the holocaust.  The first movie that caused me to take another<br />look at how evil can infiltrate the many ranks of sheep that we call mankind.
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|Disney, who created the greatest feature length cartoons in the word from Snow White to Pinocchio to Fantasia to Dumbo, had a brief renaissance, in which they produced The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and Tarzan.  Then, famously, they got a CEO who said, &#34;What do we need with Pixar, we can make cartoons just as good for half the price.&#34;  And that was the end of that.<br /><br />Aladdin is first rate.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This game is very addicting.  the only issue I had with it is that it's only 42  levels.  We finished it in 1  night
B0015XHP3Q|3.0|Not as good as the first Rambo movie, but a whole lot better than the second Rambo movie.  Enjoyable but not essential.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Nice that Amazon Prime has it available for streaming.  Looking forward to Season 4.  The actors are all great as well.
B009IQG5LK|4.0|When (to the best of my memory) Madonna licks her own spittle, you know you're at camp.  But it is a fair amount of fun to watch major stars (Dustin Hoffman, et. al.) trash a mid-level comic strip.  Good, but no Little Orphan Annie.  &#34;The sun'll come out, tomorrow.&#34;
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I want to shout out to user &quot;A F Whigs&quot; for the review that convinced me to give this game a try. I love it! The program gives you information throughout each level which is slightly annoying but you can get over it quickly as it is more like a signal I have come to associate as events progress the game in different ways. The strategies for each plague type have taken me a little while to recognize but when I get the hang of it, pieces fall into place and culminate in a very satisfying end to the human race.;)
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game works great on the kindle fire HD. I like that you can play live opponents. It makes the game a little more fun than if you have to just play computer opponents. The bonuses are great and don't cost real money. They cost points made by playing the game so yet another perk.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun, very addicting but nice graphics. I usually play until my kindle needs recharging, is that bad? I don't care,  too much fun.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Why does amazon sell A product that they don't support on their own device?  Get with it Amazon and make an app available that will allow casting to this product. It works great with laptop
B00371XIJE|5.0|When I write reviews I try to keep them informative and as brief as possible.<br />So what can I say that has not already been said?<br /><br />I have not cried watching a movie since I was 11 and saw Brians Song.<br />This movie makes Brians Song look like a comedy.<br /><br />Dave
B0007MWZEK|3.0|It works fine but with not as many amenities as the new one.  I use it anyways.  It gets the job done!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I love being able to keep up on all the blogs, websites, tweets from various businesses, friends, etc that I love to read.
0345529057|5.0|Martin's world of kings, knights, and their &#34;small people&#34; is amazing in its detail -- what they ate, what they wore, the places and languages -- so that you are transported to this land.  You know these people.  You feel the cold, the pain and difficulties of living in the Dark Ages.  Reminds me of James Michener in the thoroughness of his research, so that you understand these people in these places as if you were there yourself.  A huge adventure, even if it's way more violent than I would like, but even the violence is true to the times.  Sure not the &#34;good old days&#34; but still a grand place to visit -- and then come home again to our 21st-century lives.  Whew!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is actually easier to use than the online version on my Kindle Fire.  I find myself not using the online version on my computer and accessing facebook with this app or my iPhone facebook app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super cool and fun. at first it takes time to load but then its quick! And it is super fun and really cute :)
B000FA675C|5.0|The e-version of this book is super easy to read.  I've had some books (possibly non kindle version) that are hard to scroll through, but this one is easy.  I've read this book in paperback version previously and loved it enough to purchase the e-version.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game of course is a lot like the first version. But at the same time the game is a different game completely. New monster and effects. And you can change your person which is prettty cool. I think it is a little Mrs challenging tthen the first but thats not a bad thing. So it is a great and cool game. And its free!!! :)
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I could not get this app to link to my printer.  It kept saying I was linked, but it would never turn on my printer, much less print anything.  Very aggravating
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a pretty quick read, and I enjoyed the story line. It is a little predictable, but not so much as to detract from the story.
B000UGZTQO|4.0|It works well and I like the way it functions,but I thought the grip rotated 90 degrees to view portrait or landscape, but it's just one orientation. other than that small annoyance it works very well so far.
0142420891|5.0|This book was good. Maybe not as good as the first, but it was still great to read. I love Gayle Forman. Such a good author.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game. I have competitions with my son and his girlfriend, and my daughter. Once you start playing, you won't be able to stop.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I have never read anything like this.  Awesome book. Plot is intricate with lots of levels of understanding. The Shadow character stays with you.  I'm still thinking about him...
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is really good  i love it i was so upsessed with it<br />until i unlocked all the characters
B006UUK1YE|5.0|This movie is so much better than I remembered. It was truly a pleasure to rewatch it. The soundtrack is also absolutely awesome!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game<br />I could play for hours. My friend told me about it and I have been enjoying the challenge ever since. You will also enjoy it.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|Enjoyed the movie immensely and also the music.  Very good and entertaining.  Have watched more than once and have enjoyed the movie even more...James
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's such a good game. Me and my brother love it. I just wish you could get tokens easier. It makes it less fun  because you can't get the better costumes.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is so much more fun than most of the games I play, I live this game so much.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|downloaded game and it won't open. my boys waited for it and are kind of sad now. please fix and lmk when we can play. thanks.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I gave up on this book.  Too slow moving and introspective.  I didn't like the any of the characters.  I know its made best seller lists ... why is a complete mystery to me.
B002KKCVPU|5.0|I chose to 2/1 of the shoe size greater than usual, it's perfect. Feeling really good, I walk every day is more, it is very comfortable to wear shoes. My feet don't feel a bit tired, and the bottom of the rubber grip is very strong. To you won't regret to buy at a time
B005FLX1HS|5.0|MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVED IT EVERY SONG WAS GOOD!!!!WE PLAY IT IN THE CAR EVERY WHERE WE GO IT IS REALLY AWESOME
0385536828|5.0|This is  my first Ian McEwan book and I loved it.  I fell in love with his prose and his style, and I could not wait to read the book each day (after I fell asleep reading it the night before).  I loved the ending and thought it was clever and unusual.  I can't wait to start reading his other books.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits is a great series. I didn't even know this show exsisted until I started watching it on my Kindle.  Keep the good shows coming!
B00CRW2066|5.0|Maybe a couple of the songs sound reminiscent of previous songs, but it's not a crime. If you like The National, you're going to be A-OK with this album. It's great. I just play it over and over, and my wife hasn't killed me or broken anything.
B005544V6A|5.0|I got hooked on the series, Suit, the first show I watched.  The characters are very interesting and likable. This is a MUST see!
B009O07NDY|5.0|I loved the music from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and was not disappointed with The Hobbit soundtrack.  I loved the vocals too
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is fantastic! There are so many inspiring things to see. This app is easy to use and the only problem with it is you will never ever be able to get off. It is a great entertainment and i highly recommend it.  :)five stars all the way!
B00BZAJMWG|4.0|Good movie.  Not entirely what I expected but good nonetheless.  Unusual characters with obvious flaws.  Good acting.  Will watch again.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|Beautiful love story of a feminine lady who becomes her husband-kings confidante.  Tragedy strikes when King Arthur's spoils of war and battle training avert his heart from his first love.  Lady Genevieve, lonely and a bit too sensitive to a younger knight- Sir Lancelot, betrays her heart to another and King Arthur is eternally wounded in his soul.<br /><br />If you like period films and musicals, then you'll enjoy this film.  What I appreciate most about the film making is that the musical overtures, songs and scores do not overwhelm the story plot.  The backdrops are beautiful and authentic looking.  Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave a wonderful to behold as an onscreen couple.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed the series very much, wish there had been more books!  I really enjoyed the Lisbeth Salander character most of all.  Sharp cookie!
B00DU74U74|4.0|Great movie!  Really enjoyed it a lot.  Would even rent it again.  Not just a teen movie, enjoyable for adults too.
B004IOVGW0|5.0|Picnic is an old Hollywood movie.  It's very stilted in places but it's always been one of my favorites.  It's Kim Novak's big breakout movies.  There's a scene of Holden and Novak dancing under Chinese lanterns to Moonglow that will sweep you off your feet and will definitely be right up there as one of the best love scenes ever captured on film..  This movie is based on  a play by William Inge.  See Kansas in 1956 when a stranger rides into town on the railroad and if affects the whole town..  Wonderful cast.
B00821OX98|5.0|An engrossing science fiction show – post-apocalyptic alien invasion, believable characters and a riveting story line. I would ecourage everyone to watch.
B005OGYH90|2.0|I bought this 2 CD set because it said in the description that the DVD was included.  I wanted the ENTIRE show filmed in Stoke on DVD, but only 5 songs of the 21 songs recorded were on the DVD. Shame on me I didn't read the full product description.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|That's the question the story answers, w/ great effect - u can't watch this movie and not walk away feeling entertained :)
0307949508|5.0|This is part two of a Trilogy. You really should read Part One first and then after you finish this one, you will be searching for Part Three. A very good story, such a shame that the author died after writing the third part of this Trilogy, he was a very good writer. It's a thriller that will not let you put the book down. I heartily recommend all three books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is soooooo much fun its kinda addicting<br />I love it so much i play it a lot and all of my friends have it
0307742539|5.0|If you've read the first two books in this series, you will delight in this third book. A very exciting thriller told in three books. A movie was made from the first book, now we need two more movies made from Book 2 and Book 3. A very good author, very good story.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|It came when it said it would! I bought it as a gift, birthday boy was happy. I haven't seen the movie myself.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Do you like video games? Old and new? Do you root for the bad guy sometimes?  Do you like love stories?  Do you like cute girls, cars, racing, and candy?  If so this is for you!<br /><br />A great movie for kids through grandparents - as long as they've played a few video games along the way!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I really like the app.  The only thing that I wish is that I could use it as background noise, but apparently I have to purchase the premium app.  I may do it as I really like the sounds.  They're very soothing.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|If you like Roald Dahl, you'll like this movie.  It's got the poorly treated child who wins in the end storyline;  I love a happy ending.  There are a few twists and turns along the way, and some strong stereotypical characters, but a fun movie.  (Especially if you are in education and can't stand domineering principals!)
1567184855|5.0|This is very intriquing information without being a retread of all the other books that I've read on the subject.  The case studies are amazingly interesting.  I purchased this as an audio book to listen to while I go for walks and I liked it so much that I purchased Destiny of Souls as well. Will probably listen to it twice since there's so much to digest.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|It is much better then most of the reviews say. I loved this book and it left a lot of unanswered questions that I hope are answered in the next book. Some of it was confusing and I had to reread some. That's the only reason I didn't give this novel five stars.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|But I don't have the background in business and finance to get people to listen. Listen people like your life depends on it. It does.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|This is funny for every comic book action loving person to enjoy. Superman like tale with comedic spin. Brings me delight when I see it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The only problem is they don't. Give a person. Enough coins so u have to stop and wait fir a while then you will get a few more. Game always is interrupted because of that. Of course you have the option of buying coins so. You can continue, but I feel it's false advertisement when they say  it's a free game,  well, that s only partially true.  Very  fun  and addictive .  I Recommend this game for all ages..  However, they try to tempt you into paying for coins.  So be aware of that.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Enjoyable story and performances of a behind the scenes making of a Broadway show. Loved the characters and drama created.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I bought this item because my car only has a radio and I wanted to listen to music that I liked on a 16 hour drive. The interface is a bit awkward but it definitely works. I keep my music sorted into folders and browse the folders on the device for what I want to listen to.<br /><br />Here are the thing I love about the device:<br />(1) Multiple inputs: You can plug another audio device into this one, or you can plug in an SD card. I have two 32 Gb SD cards, so I have a lot of room and flexibility for playing music. Audio devices usually have cheap built in storage that fails after some reachable amount of use. Using an SD card instead is a great way to prolong device life.<br />(2) Powered by the power port in the car: It's great to not have to rely on batteries, and internal batteries are another point of failure in many music devices.<br />(3) Broadcast to FM: That's really what this device is about, and in my experience it works great.<br /><br />Here are the downsides:<br />[1] Can only be powered by car power port (&#34;cigarette lighter&#34;): Also, it is best to not have the device plugged in while you crank the car. If you do, and it blows the fuse in the device, just replace it and the device should work again. It comes with one spare fuse.<br />[2] Rigidly fixed to car power port: It would be nicer to have a convenient cable to provide power.<br />[3] The interface is kinda inconvenient, but it gets the job done. I like to sort my files into folders on an SD card, and the browse by folder on the device.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I like the setup and the graphics but I am not a big fan of games that take a lot to beat levels. You get so far and make a bad swipe and then get sent to do it over or pay a recovery fee with actual money. Plus I got a message on my tablet every other day, saying &#34;your minion is ready.&#34; I know I have the app on my tablet and I'll play it when I want, I don't need someone telling me when to play it.
0142004235|5.0|Not only is the book in perfect condition, but also its content and storyline is great. Steinbeck enriches East of Eden with static characters whose journey will teach you valuable life lessons!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|For reasons beyond my control I could not get set down to watch season 10 of NCIS and season 9 gave us a big cliff hanger. I watch all the marathons that I possibly can and had yet to see the first one of this season. My husband and I rented on one of our rare evenings alone and we was very pleased with it. I just love Abby! She keeps you laughing through the show and then there is Zevia and Tony with their chemistry that keeps you wondering. \\"Probie\\" reminds me so much of my brother and Gibbs keeps it real, absolutely love his smile. All in all love the show and how it feels like you are actually with them investigating the crimes and what's happening around them

0812550706|4.0|I am a junior in high school and Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card was a reading requirement for my English class. I also love reading outside of school; I do it as much as I can when I have free time. I have read quite a few science-fiction books as well as many other novels from various genres. Although we were required to read Ender's Game, I enjoyed it thoroughly and found myself reading way ahead of the class and unable to put it down.He also writes in a way that allows the reader to know Ender's thoughts and feelings; most of the novel is written from Ender's point of view. Card creates a few round characters that we are able to learn a lot about.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book because I love the Castle TV program. From the moment I started reading, I felt like I knew the characters.

B008JFUUIA|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Pitch Perfect is set at the fictional Barden University, featuring the rivalry between an all-male a capella group, 'The Treblemakers' and an all-female group, 'The Barden Bellas'. The protagonist is Beca Mitchell, played by the talented Amy Kendrick. Beca wants to be a DJ and move out to LA, much to the chagrin of her father, who is a professor at Barden. He strikes a deal with Beca, that she must participate in one college activity and if after one year, she doesn't find it fulfilling, he'll finance her trip to the west coast.<br /><br />'Pitch Perfect' is most successful, when the music groups are performing their a capella numbers. The film begins with the introduction of The Treblemakers and The Barden Bellas at the national a capella finals at Lincoln Center in NYC, during the previous semester. Aubrey, the strident co-leader of the Bellas, ruins their chances when she throws up on stage (the workaholic and seemingly in control Aubrey, obviously can't stand the pressure).<br /><br />Act 2 begins nicely when the a capella auditions begin at Barden, each candidate singing parts from Kelly Clarkson's 'Since U Been Gone'. Desperate for members, the Bellas end up selecting a group of odd balls, including Beca, who comes in late for the audition, only to wow the audience by singing a folk-rock tune, with a cup as a percussive accompaniment. There's also 'Fat Amy' (Rebel Wilson from 'Bridesmaids'), Stacie, a self-admitted nymphomaniac, Cynthia-Rose, a lesbian with a gambling problem and Lilly, who sings so softly, no one can hear her (she later is revealed to have talent as a beat boxer).<br /><br />There are a number of scenes in 'Pitch Perfect', where the film's scenarist, Kay Cannon, veers away from the music and bores us with dialogue heavy narrative. A good ten minutes could have been cut from those scenes which involve the initiation of the new members of each a capella group as well as the following scene, some kind of 'mixer', where the boys and the girls get a chance to interact.<br /><br />It's at this point where the love interest begins in earnest, with Beca rejecting the advances of Jesse, who has just been selected to be one of the new members of the Trebelmakers. Jesse initially bores Beca with some dull zombie conversation but eventually woos her by appealing to her romantic, visual nature (first, he hides his face with a set of old record albums; later he convinces her to watch old movies (which is not her thing), especially the 80s film, 'The Breakfast Club'. In the finale, Beca utilizes the 80s hit, 'Don't You (Forget about me), the key song in 'The Breakfast Club', which helps the Bellas win the final competition.<br /><br />The Bellas manage to get by in the regional competition, after one of their competitors, lamely feature Muppets, as part of their performance. The scuffle between the Treblemakers and another group afterward, goes on a little too long, and Beca ends up getting arrested after sticking up for her schoolmates. Jesse also infuriates Beca after he calls her father. The conflict between Beca and Aubrey escalates, as the latter wants her mates to wear the same uniforms and perform the same songs, they've used before.<br /><br />The dark moment of Act 2, occurs when the Bellas lose in the semi-finals. Beca infuriates Aubrey because she did a little improvisation during their final number and quits the group. Beca must do some soul-searching and she finds it watching 'The Breakfast Club'. She's now receptive to her father (no longer rebelling) and agrees to rejoin the Bellas.<br /><br />It should be noted that Cannon's screenplay contains two moments of outright political incorrectness. First there's Beca's dour Korean roommate, who for some reason seems to dislike non-Asians. Then there's the black lead singer of the Footnotes, who's disqualified from the finals because he's not a high school student. This is the reason why the Bellas get a second chance to sing at Lincoln Center in the finals.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there's an additional sub-plot which I failed to mention before. Bumper, the Treblemaker's egotistical lead singer, quits after being offered a gig as a backup singer to John Mayer. That allows, Jesse's quirky roommate, Ben, a magician, to realize his dream of singing for the Treblemakers.<br /><br />The finale isn't very hard to figure out. Beca is appointed the leader of the Bellas and they adopt her new costumes and arrangements. In a rousing face-off, both groups perform magically, but the Bellas have the edge, with Beca leading the way.<br /><br />'Pitch Perfect' is an enjoyable, musical treat, featuring some fantastic a capella arrangements of both contemporary hits as well as classics from an earlier time in the rock/pop era. As for the story, it goes on for about twenty minutes too long and some additional, judicious editing, could have markedly improved the storyline. I would recommend seeing 'Pitch Perfect' and purchasing the soundtrack.ond chance to sing at Lincoln Center in the finals.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there's an additional sub-plot which I failed to mention before.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is a good game but I would not have bought the world pass if I knew they would include it in the next version so to speak though at the time it was fun having levels none of my friends had at the time  . All in all it was a decent game but I must tell you that there is no online  interaction like I would have enjoyed .
B009AMANBA|5.0|What an amazing movie.  For me the strength in this movie was the portrayal of the integrity, courage and wisdom of one human being whose contribution was to usher forth a massive change that would unfold over the next 150 years to benefit all of humankind.  I would hope children around the world, wherever there is inequality, servitude and limitation of human rights get to see this movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It was awesome Dragons. My husband and daughter both love to play. Anyone from 4- adults can enjoy this games. I suggest giving it a try.
B002XXPNXG|4.0|Never have been a fan of chatty, overly-talking not much action or education type of movie but somehow I totally enjoyed this.  YOu get to know and like the characters and so I plan to see the third movie in this series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is epic. it is one of the best games I have.this is the best game in the world!!!!!!!!!!?
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I read the book, then watched the movie.  I thought the book was better.  I really enjoyed the book.  Good read.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Game is very interesting for the most part it is easy but every now and then a hard one comes up. It may take you a minute but very fun love to play..<br /><br />...
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Great read but I still loved A thousand Splendid Suns the best. I thought it was a great summer read.  Another great novel by Khaled Hosseini
0061122416|5.0|This is my favorite book in the entire world, I could read it a thousand times over! Full of great insights.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|funny for the first 30 min. then is all downhill and depressing. So glad my 40's in not this BS! Don't waste your time.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I like this product also. I did`nt order for myself but, for my Granddaughter<br />who is now able<br /> to charge her Kindle Fire<br />Would suggest to family and friends..
B001EBWINQ|4.0|Interesting depiction of the times.  I liked it a lot, but can't say I loved it.  The characters evidently speak more to others than they do to me.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|All 3 headlining actors; Nicholson, DiCaprio and Damon did an exceptional job in this movie. Very intense and lots of twists and turns along the way. Definitely one of my favorite movies!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 of Downton Abbey was just as good as the previous ones. However, I was sad about loosing Mathew and Sybil.  That was the only part  I did not like. Can't wait to see what Downton has in store for us in Season 4.
B00CP4RZIO|5.0|Allow me to start off by stating the title of the review is not a reference to their 2007 album Resurrection, but is directed towards the lineup changes that have occurred over the past few years. The first time Chimaira had a resurrection was when they welcomed drummer Andols Herrick back into the band and signed a new record deal with Ferret. This one: an entirely new lineup with frontman Mark Hunter being joined by Dååth members Sean Zatorsky (keyboards & backing vocals), Emil Werstler (lead guitar), Jeremy Creamer (bass), former Dirge Within guitarist Matt Szlachta (rhythm guitar) and Bleed The Sky drummer Austin D'Amond (drums). Lots of fans felt that with Andols, Rob Arnold and Matt DeVries being absent, it meant the end. Crown Of Phantoms clearly kills that theory as it is one of the strongest albums in Chimaira's discography. While there is a fresh sound on this album, it still has that attitude that Chimaira is known for.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Suspenseful, well developed characters, intriguing contemporary story line, colorful, well photographed often surreal scenes which stick long after viewing. Writers have a vivid insightful imagination.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This was the first Maggie Newberry I've read:  it was good enough that I've read and enjoyed several other books in the series.
B00DYWO09I|2.0|Great graphics, but I could not scroll forward which is needed. Would only hop a step. Would scroll fine to go back to start. Gave up and deleted. Was trying to run it on Kindle Fire.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Great, if you need more space the one is cheap vs others cloud storage. I guess that I going to buy at least 20 GB
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is a great book ! I could not put it down. I wanted to read more, until I was finished.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Very addict, you can not stop to play, you wish to do every step to get the next. I recommended
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best written parallel stories ever. I'm not sure I've ever read a book from a POV of a dog, where the dog has an adult thinking process. This will one of my all time favorite books forever.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I downloaded part 1 for free because I had heard about Wool before and was curious. I was so hooked after the first forty-nine pages, I went and bought the whole thing. This is easily one of the best science fiction books I've ever read, and one of the best novels I've read in a long time. It's a long book, but don't let that put you off; once it<br />gets going, the pages fly by.<br /><br />This book deserves to be on the bestseller shelf at B&N. It's that good. Hugh Howley has set a new standard for indie books with Wool. I can't wait to check out the rest of his stuff.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|ENTERTAINING AND NICELY RENOVATED A TRUE COLLECTIVE ITEM. I DID NOTICE SOME ISSUES WITH THE AUDIO SOUND BEIING EDITED WITH TYPE...
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|A disappointment after The Kite Runner, trying too hard to build on the same base and ending up as a strained plot and jumbled characterisation.  Still a good read, but not a five star piece of writing this time.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is very addicting. The acting is great and the subplots have been very good. I thoroughly enjoy it.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This is an awesome movie made by an awesome guy, Dave Grohl. It shows just how much one shall studio can change music history forever. Great guest appearances by many famous musicians. I would definitely watch this again.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is awesome and addicting! I hope that amazon prime streaming never takes this show off the web. I'm fascinated by this thrilling sci-fi show!
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|First, I don't think this should be classified as sci-fi. It had a sci-fi element, but it's more of a love story in a fantasy world. Unfortunately, the love story felt so forced that I didn't feel like I could really root for these two people to beat the odds. And the ending was so abrupt that it left me feeling like, \\"wait, what? That really just happened?\\" I'm a total sucker for forbidden love movies, and I still couldn't completely get behind it.<br /><br />That being said, visually, I couldn't get enough. It was just so beautiful. They did a great job creating the contrast between different worlds, loved the color undertones, and camera movement was really fluid.<br /><br />If you're someone that watches movies for plots, you might want to skip this one. If you're a visually stimulated type of person, then it's worth watching. It's not a long movie, so you don't have to feel like it's a huge time investment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get this game because it is the  in the world it is just like PC but no levers or stuff like that.
B000FIMG68|5.0|addicted. watch over and over. so many dump twisted unexplained mysteryes. Like a polar bear? Invisible monster? With no explination. Mindless entertainment, works for me.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What can I say about Downton Abbey that hasn't been said already. It is an exceptional series. Since I only started watching after season two, I really wanted to know the story background. I have not been disappointed and plan to purchase seasons  three and four. If you like historical stories, you have here a wonderful look at the castle, costumes, and life of the wealthy and those in servitude--not to mention England during WWI. I've told my friends they really should invest in this great entertainment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love love love love police this book!!! This is my second time reading it and I basically read it in a day. You can not put it down it has that perfect touch of action and excitement with a touch of romance! I highly recommend it and most people who liked the movie or not thought the hunger games was truly amazing. It's worth the buy!!!
B00AFEYEUI|5.0|Fantastic! It's MOFI,I knew it would be great but I was still amazed by the sound of this legendary album
B003ZJ23XU|5.0|Fun when I need a stay-cation I turn to this movie. Especially if you are a tired mommy. Always a visual  delight and an excellent escape
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was great I had to read it for school  but I'm happy I had to I recommend reading this !
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I can read or play this little game.  Thanks for developing and hope to more just lit it.  Good job.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|We had a old school movie night with our friends and enjoyed sharing this with our friends.  Still very fun!
0553801473|4.0|To say that A Song of Ice and Fire is a beloved franchise is an understatement. Many individuals, excluding myself, felt that George R.R. Martin's last outing \\"A Feast for Crows\\" was in poor show.  It was so strange to see the forums light up with outrage over a book that was, by my observation, one of the best in the series.  Two of the most common complaints were that \\"Feast\\" didn't feature the most beloved characters in the series, i.e. Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon Snow, and that it didn't feature a truly memorable scene like the Red Wedding from \\"A Storm of Swords\\".  That all changes in \\"A Dance with Dragons\\".  Written as a companion piece with \\"Feast\\", \\"Dance\\" features all of the northern and western characters that were missing from the fourth novel.<br /><br />More likely than not, the most common complaint of \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" will be the tremendous length of the book.  \\"Dance\\" is the longest entry in the series, and just as the case with Feast, it has a certain unhurried feel to it. In all fairness to the complainers, \\"Dance's\\" narrative does overlap with \\"Feast's\\" narrative for about the first 600 or so pages.  It is the investable result of \\"Feast's\\" own incompleteness, and the way its manuscript was culled from that of \\"Dance\\" to begin with.<br /><br />As previously mentioned, the three most beloved characters (Danny, Jon, and Tyrion) make a return.  In fact, they carry the bulk of the plot this time around, which depending on whether you enjoy their characters could be a good or bad thing.  Both \\"Feast\\" and \\"Dance\\" follow the culmination of the third novel \\"Storm\\", and Martin takes great care and deliberation to follow the main characters as Westeros tries to rebuild their nation in the aftermath of the War of Five Kings.  There are times in the novel where things are slow going, and it makes you wonder whether Martin just threw in the towel and is trying to ride this thing out.  But the cumulative effect of the novel, once it is over, is formidable, proving that Martin hasn't lost any of his mastery of writing what is considered the greatest fantasy epic of all time.  It really takes reading the whole book to appreciate what Martin has created this time around.<br /><br />Up north at the Wall, Jon Snow, now serving as the 988th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, has his hands full.  The Other's, also known as the undead menace that is destroying everything north of the Wall, are driving the Wildling's towards the wall, leaving Jon to figure out what to do about it.  On top of that, the self-proclaimed King of Westeros, Stannis Baratheon, is becoming an arrogant nuisance who hopes to unite the entire north by raiding the land.<br /><br />Elsewhere, everyone is waiting for Dany Targaryen, who has claimed the city of Meereen as her own, to make her intentions clear.  All are somewhat bewildered by the fact that Dany has chosen to take up residence in Meereen, abandoning her claim to the thrown, at least for the time being.  Dany is determined to do right by the people of Meereen, whom she has liberated from slavery by banning that institution entirely.  It is a decision that has crippled the economy.  It also made a whole mess of people angry and upset at her decision.  These people have begun to assassinate her soldiers, leaving the city a very unsafe place for Dany and her followers.<br /><br />And finally there is Tyrion, fleeing Westeros after murdering his father with a crossbow, he finds himself in about the most humiliating and dire circumstances that he has come across thus far in the series.  Later in the book, we get to see a bit more of what transpired in the lives of Arya, Cersei, Jamie, and the others.  Meanwhile, underlying everything is the sense that there is fresh chaos about to erupt with the realm.  It is only a question of where and when, someone will strike the first blow.<br /><br />As expected, Martin's writing is nothing short of amazing.  Beyond the prose, the editing is something to be marveled. Thousand-page epic fantasy doorstoppers are plentiful, but you don't often find one that manages to balance multiple plot threads and vast ensemble casts so smoothly that readers never get bewildered, lost, or just plain bored out of their minds.<br /><br />Once you dive into the meat of this novel, you'll know without a doubt, that you are back in the Seven Kingdoms, where lives are cheap, words are wind, and winter is coming.eled.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I found this a very interesting account of world reaction to a world disaster!  Liked the account with the interview style and I would not want to watch the movie!
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this multiple times and have over watched the movie. Every time I read it, I am reminded of my relationship with my husband. At first meeting him, I had nothing kind to say of him. As time went, my love for him grew. Now, we are happily married with two sons. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!
B0082Z447U|2.0|Hard to read - too much un-necessary description.  The story line was good, but I skipped many pages that I felt were not necessary to the strory.
0743270754|5.0|Originally someone loaned me the softcover copy of this book. Despite that it often was a challenge to lug around a 900 (I think) page book.<br /><br />In the end, I only read 400 pages of it. HOWEVER, I loved the book so much (and wanted something that I could highlight - turning back the pages of books is not the best way to reference information) that I purchased it on my Kindle.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it was illuminating!!! I have a heart for Lincoln and wanted to get a clearer picture of THE REAL LINCOLN (especially after I saw the movie). This does it! Not only is it a fascinating look into the history of that period but you also get to glimpse into the lives and times (through their writings, etc) of the men surrounding Lincoln.<br /><br />Finally, I LOVE the fact that the author includes (almost) 100 pages of historical references!!!<br /><br />With our increasing practice of revising history (in my opinion, to suit our lack of decaying morals) it was refreshing to read (and have traced) an extraordinary time in America's history.<br /><br />For those who have an interest in the shaping of an era in America (the civil war, slavery, politics, family, relationships), this is a book worth reading. (I'll be starting from the beginning and savoring the first 400 pages a second time.)<br /><br />Enjoy!!!
B006S086AM|1.0|This would probably be a fun movie for a younger person.  I, however, am not that young anymore, so I found it boring and silly.  Didn't finish it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best I play it every day. You can surf in a Subway!!! Buy it NOW it's fun
1594746036|5.0|This is a most unusual and oddly charming novel with fascinating characters who inhabit a well-imagined world. The writing interspersed with antique photos is unique. I look forward to the sequel.
1426209584|5.0|Birds of Paradise have always fascinated me as being so anomolously showy.  I mean, why should these birds scattered over a tiny portion of the globe be so glamorous looking and act so oddly to attract mates?  This book answered all my questions.  It is very informative, and includes amazing photos of these unearthly, gorgeous creatures.  If you have an interest in birds of paradise, I recommend this book highly.  I bought another book on the same topic around the same time I bought this one, and while the other book was good for historical background, this is the book for facts and figures as well as lovely photographs.  I visited the birds of paradise exhibit at the Smithsonian museum in DC after reading the books.  While the exhibit used some of the same info from the book, the book is much more comprehensive.
B005544V6A|5.0|This has been a rare find, i'm so glad that I found suits.  The storylines are great andt he characters are relatable.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|this hauntingly beautiful movie, is a great piece of motion picture history. I love sci-fi and just for that alone i like the movie, but the story was amazing, love the twist halfway through the movie. As I said the cinematography and score are stunning especially in BLURAY, so don't buy this if not in BLURAY. The extra features of the making of this film are very interesting and surprising.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Set in the English countryside in contemporary times, this author addresses the sensitive subject of the \\"right to die\\" debate with the burgeoning romantic relationship between a formerly career driven daredevil and the seemingly content unadventurous young  woman in a small town.<br /><br />Coming across this book initially, I thought the title was too small, too basic but when the book was finished...well, let's just say that the title could not have encompassed this storyline more beautifully
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I wish it was longer, but it was a ton of fun while it lasted.  I wish there was an &#34;undo&#34; button for every level, but that's a minor complaint, and doesn't take anything away from the game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Downloaded this book from Amazon after seeing it on one of those top read/book of the month lists.<br /><br />From the onset, the author grabbed me with his laugh out loud lines and quirky,fast paced banter between the lead characters. The big \\"C\\" is definitely a tough subject to tackle  and this author does it with grace. For anyone who has been personally affected by this terrible disease or have had family members undergone the painful, debilitating treatments, this book was simply a testament to to the strength of the human spirit.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun fun fun scene change goals are more and more complex costumes are nice touches and the friends challenges are vary interesting
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Really not a bad game.  Couple of the levels were a little harder but overall pretty easy.  Still fun though
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Would recommend to everyone. This is a great game for all ages and the kids love it.
B00847KFDS|4.0|My husband is a long time fan and liked receiving this new CD.  It was convenient as I was already making an Amazon purchase so no extra shipping of a special trip to a retail store.

B003U6BE8I|3.0|This movie is well made but  the story is just so..so and pretty predictable. It's definitely not as good as Harry Potter.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Reasonably true to grad-school life (as i remember it at Purdue)<br /><br />I won't reveal which character I most resembled, but the goofy situations are similiar.<br /><br />You had to have been a &#34;square&#34; (NOW &#34;geek&#34;) to really appreciate.

B0090X4GLW|5.0|I loved the movie and just love all the songs on this CD. I listen to it every chance I get.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Historically very accurate, and an amazing way to experience and understand the Japanese.  If you are a westerner who has spent any time in Japan,  you will love this novel.  Even if you have never been to Japan this is a book worth reading.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|Good story, but it jumped around. Hard to keep track of where they were and when. Also, sometimes It's hard to believe that Kate was ever in the CIA. But,all in all, it was a good mystery.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I was so excited to get the DVDS. It never worked for me...something about the zone not being right. I never understood it!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|no plot, worst movie ive seen in a while.watched a second time to see if i missed something,I did not!
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Great show. A lot better than what I expected. Really keeps you wanting to watch more. I'm looking forward to season 2.
1584233494|5.0|This was a gift for my brother and he loved it. The book is huge! It was sent all the way to Switzerland with no dramas!
0547258305|2.0|Graceling starts out well, with a solid action set piece that introduces the magic system (\\"graces\\" that give people mutant abilities as well as mismatched eyes) and main character.  I liked that the main character, Katsa, was given an action hero type super-power and then actually used it to do action hero things.  I even liked the basic setup where she is given the strongest possible physical grace--she's pretty much a medieval Terminator--but is vulnerable to the mind affecting graces.  The resulting phobia she has rings true to me, as it is her only real weakness.  The social awkwardness that results from her powers and her job as the royal thug also feels authentic.<br /><br />The problem I had is that the characters all seemed more interesting at first glance than they actually turned out to be.  What looked like they might be conflicted people--good people struggling to do the right thing, bad people who are nonetheless good rulers--turn out on closer examination to be cardboard cutouts who are either good guys or bad guys.  In a good story, it should be the other way around.<br /><br />One example of this is with King Randa, the guy who has been using Katsa as his muscle.  In the mission that serves as the turning point of the book he sends Katsa and her team to strongarm some minor noble into agreeing to marry off his daughter to a foreign noble who lives in a valuable piece of land that will be unpleasant for the daughter to live in.  In a better book the marriage would have secured some kind of important strategic advantage for the country, so the characters would face a real moral dilemma.  Here, the king just wants to steal the dowry.<br /><br />No effort is spared to make anybody opposed to Katsa more than a mustache twirling villain.  On the flip side, nobody who supports Katsa has any character flaws, unless you count the guy who wants to marry her (which is evil?  I guess?).<br /><br />The romance is very paint-by-numbers.  I didn't feel that it added much to the story, and the resolution at the end was pretty weak.  I also found the random anti-marriage rants kind of off-putting.<br /><br />The world building, other than the basic idea of the graces, is very lazy.  The kingdoms are essentially named: North, South, East, West, Middle, Island, Mountain/Sea.  Tolkien this is not.  I didn't mind it that much--it made it easier to keep track of which country is which, since they are otherwise indistinguishable--but if you were thinking you might enjoy the book despite the weak characters because of some kind of depth of world building, think again.<br /><br />This book is a decent read if you have a few hours to kill, but it really wasted a lot of potential to be so much more.  The first third or so of the book was easily four or five stars.  Unfortunately the latter bits really drag it down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and can't wait intil the next season. I couldn't believe, however, that Matthew got killed off.  I understand he wanted to leave the show, but am broken hearted he will no longer be part of it.  Without Prime, I probably never would have gotten hooked.
B0063GORYU|4.0|for a free app Spider is just fine. It's a one trick pony... but it's good, has a few options for customization, doesn't crash, is entertaining, and the ads that support it are not overly obnoxious. Overall it's a good app.
076781214X|5.0|Peggy Sue reluctantly goes to her high-school reunion, embarrassed by the pending divorce from her well-known fellow class-mate. Fortunately, he's not coming; regardless, she's barraged by numerous questions about how 'they're doing,' 'how he is,' etc. Then, he shows up, and sees her. Worst of all, she's picked as the Reunion Queen, and the angst builds to such a level while on-stage that she passes out. 'Recovering,' she finds herself back in high-school, dating her future husband but also aware of her future. Reluctant to repeat the coming problems in her marriage she explores life with others and breaks up with her future husband. Ultimately she recovers, finds herself in a hospital bed with her estranged husband at her side. Their problems resolve, and its all happiness.
0064471837|5.0|\\"Sabriel\\" is by far, one of my most favorite books. Nix has a gift of pulling readers in with his intense, dramatic method of writing. The plot is amazing, the characters are lovable and you will be itching to read the next book in the series by the time you flip the last page.<br />Amazing!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat all the time. During the war events, you feel as if you are there with Katniss and the gang. If you loved the first two books, complete the series and read this one. It is well written and worth the time to read. So can't wait for the movies to come out.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Simple way to let time pass.  I do wish they would slow down on the new dragons tho.  It gets hard to keep up with.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|As a mother to a child with a mild craniofacial syndrome, reading this was a bit hard.  Some of the experiences are pretty close to what we've dealt with but not as extreme. But I am glad I finished reading &#34;Wonder.&#34; People really do need to &#34;choose kind&#34; and think a little more about their reactions. The message in &#34;Wonder&#34; is great for adults and children. I definitely recommend this book.
B005XN31LY|5.0|This show is different and refreshing.  Great characters and story lines with new twists and excitement each week.  One of the most innovative shows on television.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I DID LIKE THIS VERY MUCH BUT IT SEEMED TO  BE IN CONFLICT WITH SOMETHING ON MY KINDLE SO I HAD TO DELETE IT.
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent book.  A great combination of medical science and a personal story.  I haven't been able to get it off my mind since I read it several weeks ago (one of our book club picks!).  Recently read that it is being made into a movie.  Awesome!!!!!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Great story with so many surprises.  Eagerly looking forward to the next book to see what is going to happen to the remaining  characters next.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an extremely emotional read.<br />Was able to figure out some of it<br />Outcome was a surprise to me.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Boring, boring, boring.  Where is the erotica?  Like the first book, I found this to be nothing but a dry romance novel, with a few juicy scenes thrown in.  This is not true erotica.  I was not impressed with the writing style, story line, or the characters.  If you are looking for true erotica, look at Anne Rampling.  This book will leave you wanting.....and not in a good way.  I won't be wasting $9.99 to read the third book.  Not when I can buy true erotica for less.
0061124958|5.0|The 60th anniversary hardcover edition is wonderful.  It doesn't have a dust jacket, so I don't have to worry about my four year old ripping the cover artwork.  The illustrations are perfect, and the story is just as enchanting as I remembered it.  Great for reading aloud to my child.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am giving this one star because I was told this book was erotica.  I am so NOT impressed.  This book is just a blase romance novel with a few juicy scenes thrown in. I found it to be childish in some places, and generally boring.  I wasted my time reading this book and should have paid attention to how many people gave this book a bad rating.  I went on to read the second book, because I was told it was so much better, and I was completely let down with that one also.  Pure boring gunk.  NOT RECOMMENDED unless you want to read a dry romance novel.
B005544TRQ|4.0|The pace is hyper and the on going attention to integrity keeps me paying attention.  How can this possibly work out when the basis of employment is a lie.<br /><br />The pace is good and you care about these people.  It's better than it's commercials led me to believe.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I began this book thinking it would be just another young adult novel, rattling off about how tough life was, but was surprised to find out it was about an entire family, an emotional look into someone else's psyche. I felt everything the narrator felt, I saw the memories the writer expressed through the heroine of the story. I also loved the theme of music that was sewn throughout the entirety of the novel. It was a great, fast read for me, but I didn't want it to end. I hope that the author follows the character more throughout her life.
B00BZW5W3W|4.0|A very good selections of songs and very well produced. I suggest you check out MAYSA's previous five CD releases.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downtown Abbey season 3 gives us an idea what life what like post WWI and has such great character development and plot from upstairs to downstairs.  This is my favorite show, I can't wait for Season 4 although I'm not sure I can get over how Season 3 ended.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|If you like mythology, you'll love this book.  Here the supernatural only gradually sneaks its way into a very good novel, building to a climax you can't wait to see happen.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|It was full of the usual action, with a lot of fun spoof! Looked like the actors were having fun! I wanted to see it in case I saw Red 2 - I chose not to see the sequel...
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I read this a good many years ago, and very much enjoyed it then. It is considered to be one of the first true &#34;horror&#34; genre novels.<br />My husband and I are reading it now, instead of watching TV we read aloud and the list of books we've gone through is getting quite long.<br />We are currently focusing on older classic books.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Victorian literature, some of the way the dialog is presented will be a little difficult to read but this is a classic book that is worth the time to work through.<br /><br />The story unfolds mainly with diary, journal entries, letters and telegrams in the recounting of the tale.<br />At times it seems to move slowly but it builds..<br /><br />Our modern mythology and perception of Vampire stems very much from this book.<br />Changed with the times and romantic influences of popular culture, we now have &#34;Sparkley&#34; vampires. (wry face)<br />In my world Vampires do not sparkle.  That simply sucks.  ;)<br /><br />But the book by Bram Stoker, does not.<br /><br />This book, definite... bucket list.  :)
0767919408|5.0|This is a remarkable book about a remarkable time.<br /><br />During the summer months of 1927, America came of age.  A series of events and personalities, none of them really significant in the grand scheme of things, all transfixed the world that summer.  As Bryson points out, the significance was that it all happened here, in the US.  That was a first.  It's difficult for us to imagine or believe now, but before that time, the US was regarded as-- and saw itself as-- a rather backward place.  Not after the summer of 1927.  After that summer, everyone knew the important things happened in the US.<br /><br />It's amazing to consider all that went on that summer.  Lindbergh flew solo across the Atlantic, Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs and led the NY Yankees to the best season in baseball history, flagpole sitting became a fad, the worst floods in US history hit most of the southern US, Al Capone reached the height of his influence, Sacco and Vanzetti were executed, and on and on.<br /><br />The genius of this book is not just that Bryson tells all of these stories-- and many more-- but that he interweaves them seamlessly into a sort of tapestry.  The stories are enriched by thousands of little details about the people who were living them.  And the stories are told in a rich, conversational way.  There aren't many books that I wish would just go on and on, but this was one of them.<br /><br />I loved this book.  It's serious history, but it's told by a master storyteller.  This is one of the best books of the year, and I recommend it most highly.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season the best yet, I love how the writers really think about the way they do each season....you will be surprised..
B003V9OCS8|4.0|very compelling true story - i am not a climber but seemed realistic and had me rooting for the good guys
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I loved this story. Takes you to a very different place, almost like learning a new language. All SC FI buffs will love this.
B001DM1VXE|4.0|the black and white jumpy scenes augmented the storyline and strong acting.  evil v. evil v. semi-evil.  i recommend it!
0783225857|5.0|The based-on-a-real-life-story of this movie moved my heart.  What a brave man the main character was!  ...and, it was played by Gregory Peck ~ 'nough said.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|Not what I was looking for and too hard to use.  Just not for me,maybe giving a more user friendly format would help.
B00005CDNF|5.0|Although it is their 3rd studio album, it is really the first that the self-titled moniker seems fitting.  This is the album where we really get an idea of the sheer volume of hits ABBA was capable of putting out.<br /><br />The album doesn't waste any time getting to the hits as \\"Mamma Mia\\" starts the album off.  The track is a classic, what more needs to be said? \\"Hey, Hey Helen\\" is a great track, and underrated in my opinion.  It is vocally, instrumentally, and lyrically strong.  \\"Tropical Loveland\\" could be regarded as a `miss.'  While there is nothing wrong with the song, I feel it does not add anything to the overall album.<br /><br />\\"S.O.S\\" is my pick for the strongest song on the album.  It is one of my favorites ABBA ever did.  The hook is infectiously catchy and Agnetha's vocals during the verses convey the heartache in the song's lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Man in the Middle\\" is the most out of place track on the album.  This attempt at a Soul/Funk song would work for certain artists; the lyrics and the music is there.  It just doesn't seem credible coming from Bjorn.  Luckily a huge string of strong tracks will helps you forget the song.<br /><br />\\"Bang-A-Boomerang\\" was written by Benny & Bjorn for another artist, and not meant for an ABBA song.  However, thankfully for us ABBA recorded their own version.  Lyrically it is a simple love song, but Agnetha and Frida's vocals along with a rich instrumental track make it into something special that will be stuck in your head for years to come.  \\"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\\" has more great vocals and a sound that is almost a throwback to the Big Band era.  I wasn't a big fan of the song when I was younger, but as I've matured I appreciate it more and more.<br /><br />\\"Rock Me\\" is one of the rare Bjorn led songs that really holds up as \\"hit worthy.\\" Bjorn does a fantastic job on vocals, projecting the verses in a raw, almost sleazy tone; which is perfectly offset by the delightful chorus.<br /><br />\\"Intermezzo No.1\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the album.  The instrumental reminds me of Franz Liszt in how much Benny is able to glide up and down the piano's keys.  Its only downside is that there was never a No. 2.<br /><br />\\"I've Been Waiting for You\\" is another beautifully sung song by Agnetha.  Although it was the B Side to \\"So Long,\\" I think it is the stronger track.  \\"So Long\\" is instrumentally very good, but the lyrics and vocals feel uninspired.  It comes off as an obvious attempt to copy \\"Waterloo.\\"<br /><br />The two bonus tracks are nice additions to the core album.  \\"Crazy World\\" is a Bjorn led song, that is nothing special, but I'd prefer it went on the album over \\"Man in the Middle.\\"  The \\"Medley\\" is a great track.  ABBA's take on the three American folk songs is incredibly mixed.  The songs flow together very well even though they have vastly different beats. \\"Midnight Special\\" is my favorite of the three; I would have loved to hear a full length version.<br /><br />While it is easy to point to \\"Mamma Mia\\" and \\"S.O.S\\" as the stand-out tracks on the album; it is foolhardy to limit the album's appeal to these two tracks.  Simply consider that 7 of the 11 tracks were released as singles in at least one country. You don't need to be an ABBA fan to enjoy this album; although you will likely be an ABBA fan after hearing it.
B00969PR18|1.0|It is not at all what I am looking for, and I get so frustrated when I try to use it.  .
B005UKJX4E|5.0|The PRODUCT itself was fine. However, I did not like this movie, or at least I wasn't prepared for this kind of movie when I ordered it...I thought it would be something else. It's BEAUTIFUL but entirely symbolic. It's typical for this director, so I'd check out his other movies before delving into this one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was not really sure I was going to like the books, even though they have great public reviews.  I was so surprised once I began reading the series !  I have thoroughly enjoyed the books, and have watched the first movie !  I am truly looking forward to the whole series being out in film.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read this book about 8 times. I'm in love with the story and with Christian and Ana! This is a must read book.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Don't hesitate to buy this book, just know once you do you will be completely sucked in for the rest of the series.
B002ZG997C|5.0|I highly recommend this movie. You know the impact of a movie when the next day you are thinking about it and say,&#34;wow, that was an excellent movie.&#34;<br /><br />It has suspense, mystery, some violence, and it has a plot and a moral of the story too. Very rare these<br />days!<br />This is one of my favorite movies. It is one that you may watch again after 6-8 months and enjoy it again.<br />The ending was a surprise. So I will not say anymore about it.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Book was better. Relationship between main character and his ex-wife and daughter was not developed enough to make it believable. However, plot was fast-moving and supporting characters were quirky and entertaining.
B00006LI4D|5.0|I give this CD  5 stars for it's complete musical listening pleasure. I have listened to Ray Brown around 55yrs, Monty Alexander a little less and Russell Malone is relatively new to me. If you don't like this then you don't like life !

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I purchased my first iPhone a little over a year ago and bought this case to go along with it.  My 9 year-old and 2 year-old both love to play games on the phone so it has been dropped a countless number of times without any resulting issues.  I also love that I can just run the whole thing under the faucet in the kitchen sink to rid the surface of sticky finger residue.  I have also had the phone completely under water at the beach taking photos.
B001N3UO68|5.0|This movie packs a punch..  Great acting & plot, lots of action and suspense, plenty of great actors in the cast and lots of excitement!  Kurt Russell delivers a great performance as the hero..  Two Big Thumbs Up!<br /><br />If you like action adventure movies you will enjoy this movie..<br /><br />Definitely recommend!

1401938906|5.0|I bought the Kindle version of this book. It was under 5 dollars.<br />It is an inspiring read. However, the first two exercises did not yield ANY results.<br />I am super into this sort of stuff so I was pretty bummed. I don't hold the author responsible. Its a tough claim to expect to prove God exists to every person who reads this book.<br />While the exercises have not shown ANY results. I still give this book a solid A for effort. Its inspiring. And the way she writes is lovely.<br />How dependable is God or the Law of Attraction? So far.. according to this book.. for me.. not very dependable at all. > <<br />But I do love the way she explains her idea of God and how he/she/it operates.<br />I will continue on with the other exercises, you never know and whats the harm?<br />So I didn't experience a miracle or some miraculous witnessing of something in 48 hours.<br />And so I didn't see a pink car or pink butterfly.<br />I still believe in what she is saying. I just dont think its RELIABLE for everyone the way she presents it.<br />Thank you for your effort though. We could use more people like you in this world to keep our spirits up.<br /><br />UPDATE: It worked. It didn't take 48 hours, it took about a week but a miracle just happened. I knew deep down it would.<br />I still have not seen a pink car or butterfly. But I know I will.<br />Thank you and I apologize for my crude early assessment.

B0090SI56Y|5.0|is this a mind blowing, cerebral, emotionally twisted block buster? no, and i don't know why anyone would expect it to be.<br /><br />it's wolverine slicing his way through japan, embroiled in a feud between the family of a man he saved during WW II and yakuza. there are a lot of really fun characters and very fun action scenes and<br /><br />*possible spoiler?*<br /><br />he doesn't have his regenerate power for a chunk of the film!!! it's crazy and really exciting.<br /><br />*end possible spoiler*<br /><br />the only critique i would give it is that they missed a huge opportunity. in the old cartoon and comics wolverine always finds mental peace in japan due to zen buddhism. they should have tossed in a scene where he is losing his mind and finds relief through learning meditation or something. in the old cartoon for example he loses his inhibitions about killing and nearly kills jubilee. he even says, in a therapy session with professor x \\"i can't feel anything! even animals care about each other!\\" a pretty serious problem, then he goes to japan and works and lives in a temple where he meditates and finds peace until silver samurai attacks.<br /><br />it's a plot point that should have been in the movie. one of those things where it's like \\"they're never going to do a wolverine in japan movie ever again, so that's never going to be on the big screen.\\"<br /><br />other than that though, really fun! and the fact that that scene is missing is not all that important because without prior knowledge of this happening in the show/comics one would not miss it so it does not detract from the plot or anything.<br /><br />finally i'll say: i thought x men origins wolverine was better.<br /><br />i know that's crazy, no one agrees. this movie would get 4 and 3/4 stars and origins would get 5 from me but amazon doesn't have it set up for me to rate it like that. and even then it's a pretty minute difference. i just found the scope of origins exciting, it covers so much ground and this movie is almost totally confined to one story in japan.d and this movie is almost totally confined to one story in japan.

B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game because it is so awesome.  I also like the movie. I woud rate or give this fun and awesome game all five stars
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was a page turning mystery like I have not read for a while.  Characters are interesting and full of depth and I feel like I have only learned the minimum about them.  Thankfully there will be a sequel so we can immerse ourselves deeper into this lovely and frightening world!
B000077VR3|5.0|I gave it to a friend for a welcome gift and they loved it. It depends on if you like the movie or if you don't. It depends on the person watching but it worked well for me because she liked the movie.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I loved this movie.  I like the fact that it is a big budget movi.  The characters were great and I like seeing the early development of the friendship between Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The aroma of something that no matter how hard you try to emulate, is always just a bit off. This is how this book made me feel. The pleasure and complexity of childhood. Maintaining irrational fears and maybe not being more frightened of what you should. Before you became cynical and the world was wondrous, when the Night Indians existed in your barn and worldly affairs were noise at the edge of your cognition.<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman has filled my nose with the aromas of childhood better than my own recollections. I unfortunately never had such an adventure, but when I was young the possibility was always there and I would never have doubted it. Then again, maybe I did have such an adventure.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is a super fun game just like any other game where you have to match up similar colors to get points.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really fun game. It is better than survival craft and worth the money. Can't wait for next update

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing book<br />Awesome plot. No loopholes in it and everything was answered. Probably the best book in the series. Highly recommended.
B005LAII4E|3.0|The movie was good. I like the actors in it, but the story line was a far off. Lots of action, cool boy toys and it is a &#34;dream&#34; film where toys have been turned over to men. I think Transformer movies were put together better though.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|Ending was predictable.  I think Jack's thoughts were a bit advanced for a five year old especially in those conditions.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I like Bruce Willis movies and I do like the &#34;Die Hard&#34; series. The action is constant and it keeps you on the edge of your seat with a unique twist at the end. Recommend seeing it!
B000FC12ZA|5.0|I had read this book about 30 years ago but for whatever reason I had been thinking about it constantly so I ordered it on my Kindle.  It stood the test of time and was as engaging as I had remembered it.  Although the concepts presented in this book may seem out there to many people, I found them to support my spiritual beliefs.  I often get hung up in wanting more and more things but this book showed that profound happiness can be attained with no creature comforts what so ever.
B00D5YNQMW|5.0|Am a die hard Aerosmith fan and this DVD really puts together some of their best work! I appreciate that they went to Japan and donated their makings to the relief campaign going on there at the time. Hope the proceeds make it to people in need!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you are wondering if it works to stream the Spotify web player from a Chrome tab to the Chromecast, it does.  Tried it last night, and it works amazingly well.  Just open Spotify ([...] in a browser tab, click the Cast button, and you can play any song you want on your TV for free.  That alone is worth the $35 to me.  I don't have a nice sound system, but I would imagine if you did have a nice one, this setup would be pretty awesome.

B008HJGPVO|5.0|There are many stylus types that are really a dime a dozen, but this one is better than most, in a good way. To me, it has the feel of a \\"real\\" pen due to its length and weight. This way I can relate to writing on a piece of physical paper which is a realy plus. Another aspect of stylus is that all feel different because of the tip density, and this one feels good, I like the look and feel, and the fact that it has the amazon name on it really helps because nothing is better than a trusted brand. This is great for all types of users and i recomend it.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I was in high school when the Iran Hostage Crisis was going on.  We lived with it everyday.  This movie blew me away with the details and drama.  While I understand that the actual plane departure actually went off relatively easily, those folks still took great risks doing it!  I felt the movie made great artistic calls to reflect the feeling of the time.  We were frightened for these folks!  The story within the story was a revelation to me.  I had not realized that these six people had made to the Canadian Embassy.  Loved the whole movie!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and the peek into Scott Jurek's soul running and competitive edge. They juxtapose yet create a balance. The book reaches for the personal struggles and successes in an autobiographical sense but yet involves enough about the environment and characters(people) that become memorable to Scott and to the reader. Some parts of the book tie in with McDougall's Born To Run and it was interesting to see things from another participant's perspective. There also some interesting recipes, good tips, and most satisfying is to be able to get a honest look into Scott's career and life.

0140143505|5.0|I read this at the urging of a friend. It was a quick read and I was sorry it came to end. I have shared the book with friends and plan to continue to share. I have another book by Helene Hanff and a book about her that I can't wait to read. It made me miss those days when I sat down and wrote letters and miss those days when a letter arrived in the mailbox to be enjoyed with a cup of coffee to savor the experience. Do read this and then write someone a letter.

1416955070|4.0|Clary is just a normal girl with a quirky best friend and no clue that there are fairies, vampires, werewolves, and all manner of mythical creatures are roaming the world, until Jace Wayland walks into her life.  Once she meets him, everything changes and the jury is still out if it's for the better or not.  Then her mom gets kidnapped and she is thrust into a world were everything depends on finding a mythical hidden item in order to bargain for her mom's life.<br /><br />I originally gave this five stars, but then downgraded it because it contains a love triangle and cliffhanger and I abhor those.  I've seen a lot of hype on the blogosphere lately about the upcoming film and purposely waited until close to the movies release to read this because I knew as soon as I finished I'd be dying to see the film and I didn't want to have an excruciatingly long wait ahead.  I can honestly say that I understand the hype now.  I really enjoyed this.  It's got that addictive quality that makes it difficult to put down once you start and that is quite a quality to possess.<br /><br />As for the characters, I didn't initially love Clary.  She seemed decent enough, but too similar to so many other YA heroines.  No Bella Swan syndrome (thank Satan), but nothing about her stood out.  Short, slim, flat-chested, artsy, and relatively intelligent seems like a common theme these days.  I'm happy to report that by the end, I did come to like her character quite a bit.  That whole always fighting for your friends/family no matter what thing gets me every freaking time.<br /><br />Then we have the main attraction, Jace.  If you read my updates, I think it's pretty obvious that I liked him from the start.  There is just something about a hot, cocky, snarky, badass that just never fails to attraction my devotion.  He kept me laughing through this somewhat serious book with his one liners and comebacks and complete confidence in his sexiness.  And you can't help but feel for the guy once you learn his back story.  Team Jace, all the way.<br /><br />The other is the other point in this particular triangle.  Simon.  I sympathized with him from the get go because he's affection for Clary is rather obvious and I knew she'd never choose him.  It's almost an unwritten rule in the love triangles that they never pick the nicer guy who has always been there for them.  Simon's cute and totally geeky.  He's always ready with a Star Wars or D&D reference and even though I liked Jace more, I do hope Simon eventually finds his happily ever after.<br /><br />All the other characters were equally interesting, from Luke to Hodge to Isabelle & Alec.  I especially enjoyed Magnus Bane.  Hodge's character gets an irritated eyeroll.  The writing was great, the plotline wasn't overly original, but it definitely wasn't the same one we keep getting over and over.  What really irked me was the love triangle? Square? Pentagram?  For the first half of the book it felt like everyone liked Jace and/or Clary and it got old really quickly.  Luckily they are all over it by the end, so we don't get too much time angsting over it, but it was still annoying.<br /><br />On the whole, this is an immensely enjoyable read and I recommend it to anyone looking for an addictive thrill-ride, with some interesting, if a little predictable, twists.learn his back story.

B0011Z9360|5.0|Granted that these were songs released after the band had broken up.. but the songs were very good. Not all songs that are released after a band breaks up are good.. as a matter of fact often its just to make money for the band or the record label. In the case of this album/CD that's not the case  as a matter of fact this was some really good stuff that wasn't released on other albums for what ever reason. Perfect example of a song that was brilliant but never made it on to an album/CD until the very end on a box set was  \\"hey hey what can I do\\" The fact is that \\"in through the out door\\" was a very very weak, if not bad album/CD and CODA was a great way to end a brilliant career. The songs on this CD are very strong and are of true Zeppelin quality with the exception \\"Bonzo's Montreux\\" which is fine they were paying respects to their late great drummer. So do not hesitate.. this is a very good album worthy of its place next to the other Led Zeppelins CD's

B002RI9MWA|3.0|The Reluctant Fundamentalist has a very topical theme which explores the significant change in perception of Muslims by the West, and consequent changes in their relationship with western society, post September 11.<br /><br />Changez is a very moderate muslim from Pakistan who comes to America after having won a scholarship to study at a prestigious university. He embraces all that America has to offer, including a well-paid job in the finance industry in New York, an American girlfriend and the New York lifestyle.<br /><br />The event of September 11 is the catalyst for an abrupt change to his seemingly all -American life. The way he is treated is now subtly different - searches at airports etc - and this brings about a move away from what he now considers to be the Amoral world of capitalism and western society, which culminates in him walking away from his job and returning to Pakistan.<br /><br />This was a quick read, and the underlying sense of menace made it quite a page turner. The device of having Changez as the narrator revealing the plot through speaking about his attraction to and then rejection of American ideals to an anonymous customer in a cafe also adds something. The ending is open to interpretation and worth discussing. Recommended.
0307278255|4.0|UNACCUSTOMED EARTH, a collection of short stories by the best-selling, multi-award winning Jhumpa Lahiri, follows upon her first novel, [[ASIN:0618485228 The Namesake: A Novel]], which was filmed. The debut of the Indian-American author, [[ASIN:039592720X Interpreter of Maladies]], (1999), earned her the Pulitzer Prize, was translated into twenty-nine languages, and was an American, and international bestseller.<br /><br />The eight stories that make up this collection continue the writer's examination of the lives of Indian-born, specifically Bengali parents living as expatriates in the United States, and their American-born children's journey as `strangers in a strange land.' They take us from Brooklyn and Cambridge to Seattle and San Francisco, from London and Rome to India and Thailand, as they dissect Indian family life.  The world of mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, daughters and sons, friends and lovers, the tiny seams of mistrust and misunderstanding between her hyphenated Indian characters and their wholly `American' lovers and spouses.<br /><br />In the title story, Ruma, a housewife, finds herself moving cross-country, Brooklyn to Seattle, for her `American' husband's job,  She knows nobody in Seattle, is lonely.  Her New Jersey based father comes for a visit, which she greatly enjoys.  But her enjoyment is marred by the feeling, based on Indian tradition, that she must take her widowed father to live with her family; a tradition that her `American' husband belittles.  However, her father has a life of his own, and does not wish to relocate.  In \\"A Choice of Accommodations,\\" a cigarette burn in her skirt means that Amit's `American' wife Megan feels herself unable to go to the wedding of an old female friend of his that they have gone to Massachusetts to attend.  In \\"Only Goodness,\\" Sudha discovers, to her shock, just how dangerous her brother Rahul's alcoholism is. A trio of short stories close the book, as they follow  Hema and Kaushik, a pair who have known each other most of their lives, due to their families' friendship.  We meet them first in 1974 when she is six and he is nine; then a few years later when, at 13, she swoons at the now-handsome 16-year-old teen's reappearance; and again in Italy, when she is a 37-year-old academic about to enter an arranged marriage, and he is a 40-year-old photojournalist. Here, as in several of the stories, grief over the early loss of a mother influences the characters.  And the loss by Hema of a gift from her mother, one of her gold bangles, a loss which is apparently considered bad luck in India, continues to foretell bad luck.<br /><br />Lahiri is a vivid, concise writer, able to recount a story through telling detail such as a cigarette burn or a lost bracelet. She was born in 1967 in London, England, and raised in Rhode Island. She is a graduate of Barnard College, where she received a B.A. in English literature, and of Boston University, where she received an M.A. in English, M.A. in Creative Writing and M.A. in Comparative Studies in Literature and the Arts, and a Ph.D. in Renaissance Studies. She has taught creative writing at Boston University and the Rhode Island School of Design.  INTERPRETER OF MALADIES, her debut, won, in addition to  the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, the PEN/Hemingway Award, the New Yorker Debut of the Year award, an American Academy of Arts and Letters Addison Metcalf Award, and a nomination for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Lahiri, who was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002, now lives in Brooklyn, New York with her husband and family.<br /><br />This is the first of Lahiri's works that I've read, but it surely won't be the last. It is clearly the work of a young woman, with its emphases on love, marriage, and the baby carriage; prestigious institutes of learning, and the beginnings of careers.  I can't help wondering whether her further works will continue these emphases.  I also wondered: aside from the obvious, the spicy food, the  resplendent saris and gold bangles, the arranged marriages that are traditional in India, are there any specific features of the  Indian family, as distinguished from, say, the Italian family?  The Jewish family? Or the Irish?  We shall see.icy food, the  resplendent saris and gold bangles, the arranged marriages that are traditional in India, are there any specific features of the  Indian family, as distinguished from, say, the Italian family?

B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Of the many new(er) interpretations of Sherlock Holmes this one takes a new direction with gender and Holmes' largely implied drug habit from the original stories.<br /><br />I find Dr. Watson, played by Lucy Liu, an interesting if unconvincing take on that character. Unconvincing not so much because of Ms Liu's acting ability, which is just fine, but because of the weight of the history of that character. I'm having a difficult time accepting this Watson.<br /><br />The Holmes character is well done if played somewhat distractedly by Jonny Lee Miller. Perhaps that distractedness is his way of playing a recovering addict. Whatever it is I find it detracts from the character of Holmes. I may be that this is the first Holmes-as-recovering-addict that makes it distracting as I am accustomed to Holmes being manic at times in large part due to his habits.<br /><br />It doesn't help that the BBC reboot of Sherlock Holmes is so very much better.

B007712XAU|4.0|This was a 6 disc set which we did not view right away. Once we got the time to watch it in a marathon as we wanted, we found the second disc was unwatchable. It skipped and froze and was a digital nightmare.<br />Amazon said we had surpassed our return date and that was that. We learned that when something arrives that we need to watch it immediately. Otherwise there seems no way to get satisfaction from a near $50 purchase.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Held our interest all the way thru... Great special effects. Good balance between large & small characters. Enjoyed it muchly!
0064471837|5.0|I have read this book (and indeed the whole trilogy) several times, and keep coming back.  The world that Garth Nix has created here is interesting and different, and the story keeps you hooked all the way through.  It's definitely not just a kid's book - anyone who loves great fantasy writing will enjoy it.  The characters are likeable and you want them to triumph over the baddies.  Even my white cat is made to wear a red collar with a bell on so she can look just like Mogget!  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, and in fact, the book group I belong to is currently reading it.

B000IMKDPC|4.0|Acting was well done, story was good and direction good as well. Few problems within, can be cheesy (but endearing and in line with the original work). Not too much of an origin mess (what with the large array of X-Men in the movie), yet still sets character and motivation up well. I did really like the new costume design though, much better than the nonsense they were in the original comics, they just didn't have a place in Singer's more real universe.
B00005JKBC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was smart and thrilling.  I will be keeping this in my &#34;keeper&#34; file for sure.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|The screenplay is just bad, the dialogue can be cheesy and the origin cramming is unparalleled. Which is bad, this movie is directed very well, though, and he manages to mitigate the tide of faults. Some flooding, but not too bad.

B000JFDBXO|2.0|Not as bad as people usually say, but not good by almost any standard. It can be entertaining if you didn't watch any of the movies before it, or don't really get into superhero movie, but is generally poorly directed, over acted, and also just has a god awful screenplay. People complained about Spider-Man 3 having to many things going on (3 villains), but this screenplay is just a mash of two very separate stories that don;t mix well together, nor are they offset by pretty much any other aspect of the movie. HOWEVER, this movie still has a lot of interesting stuff, just not done well.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I love it!  Even my little nieces, 4 and 6 years old, like to listen to it.  Good work, Darius!
B000I9U8VO|4.0|Although succeeded by The Wolverine through the magic of time travel, X-Men is the best at that time. Well done in almost every fashion, though still goofy sometimes (unavoidable when you have characters like these, but done well to make them less weird). Set up very well for what WOULD HAVE BEEN Bryan Singer's X3, but sadly we all know what happened when he went to do Super Man Returns, and let Ratner do X3
0345537998|5.0|I love sci-fi and adventure novels mixed with sarcasm and wit. This fits the bill perfectly. I can't believe it took this long to stumble upon it. I was debating reading the Game of Thrones series but didn't want to make such a commitment until I knew more about RR Martin's writing style. Coming from a fan of Stargate SG1 and Star Wars, this book is a must read and outclasses many better known sci-fi books.<br /><br />I really hope this book gets picked up as a tv series or movie!
B000IDEORY|1.0|I bought this for my GF as she loves this movie and I love her.<br /><br />That said... Why do women love this movie sooo much????  It is terrible... It is basically about a bunch of drunk bums that take dancing WAY too seriously for no reason... They sit around being emo, dancing, drinking, and apparently hooking up a lot.  Whenever I think of this movie I think about the scene where the main character chick is asking her dad for money for the secret abortion, and the dad is all &#34;I can never trust you again...&#34;, it's stupid.  Maybe Patrick Swayze, and his whole troop of bubs should put together a few bucks each and pay for the damn abortion instead of involving the main character chick.  If the movie was just about their romance and practicing for the big dance-off at the end, then I might like this movie more.  But the stupid needing money for abortion depression angle is just stupid and pointless IMHO.  I am not against crazy 80's dance movies, I dig a few of the other ones.  Anyways, women are crazy... (as I go back to watching my batman cartoon from my childhood and feeling hypocritical...)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This serious will become among the classics over time. Myers has rivaled Tolkien and perhaps the likes of great novels similar to  Dante' Inferno with one exception - she, like Rowling, has an audience from age 9 to 90.
B00E8B1358|2.0|This movie was pretty bad.  It might be a little better than the fist one, but that's a pretty low bar.  It was pretty enjoyable to watch, but the story is lame, and a lot of the acting is worse.  Many of special effects looked bad, with a few exceptions.  The story was lame.  The whole movie felt anti-climactic, I never really cared about what was happening, nor did I care for any character.  Rent it if you have some tweens, but don't bother buying it.
0399159347|5.0|I could not put this book down, I read it in one sitting but was sad to turn the last page, and leave behind all of the books characters.<br />There are so many life lessons and moral decisions that are contemplated and exposed in this wonderful book.  That I would suggest it as a experience to read for young and old alike.  i am sure you will see and feel pieces of your own soul  between these pages.<br />So well written that the images jump off of the pages and into your mind, forever.<br /><br />.
B00DM0YE9S|4.0|I enjoyed it, but its not amazing.  You can tell it was made on a limited budget.  The quality feels a little better than something made for TV, but not on par with a big release.  First off, everyone is supposed to be Russian...  No one even tries an accent or anything.  There are plenty of good Russian actors that could have been cast for this movie, but of course then no one would have seen it.  Once you get past the lack of Russian complaint, the movie is not bad.  I was entertained through the whole movie.  The climax of the movie, and the ending were not the best.  The ending just sort of felt random...  And the things that happen between Ed Harris and David D.'s characters don't ever really feel right, especially when the falling out occurs. So once you get passed the lack of actual Russians, the odd plot, and strange ending, you are still left with an entertaining forgettable movie.<br /><br />Definitely a rental.<br /><br />See Das Boot, U-571, Red October, they are more enjoyable than this one.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I absolutely loved this mini series. I learned so much about Henry the 8th. The scenery was spectacular and the clothes and jewels were beautiful. I did not want it to end. The actors and actresses were exceptional. Keep them coming!
B0027ZGPDC|2.0|I love the first F&F movie.  I didn't see this when it came out as I thought the trailer looked pretty bad.  Over the years I have had several people rave about how great this movie was, telling me how I had to see it because of its awesomeness.  So, I finally rented it and I thought it was pretty bad.  The main character is a dick and the whole movie I was just thinking that he should treat his folks better and stop being such a punk douche.  Then after they set him up for being a douche they try to make you care for him... No, he is douche, I will not care for a douche.  Seeing that the only honorable characters in this movie were his folks, I was not emotionally invested at all.  Some of the cars were super cool to look at, and some of the drifting was good, but a lot of the drifting was also poor looking special effects...  I recommend just revisiting the first movie, don't bother with this.  This movie is on par with F&F 2 which is also a terrible movie.

I'm so excited for the other books in this series but I'm dreading the wait! This was one of those books where I felt lost, like a void was there, after I finished. And by lost I mean, I couldn't find anything to read after that could keep me as entertained as Tangled!

0553801473|1.0|Just completed reading the entire five book series in a period of four weeks. Yes I am a extremely fast reader. Did not have any preconceptions going into the series, beyond what I have seen on HBO. The title says it all. Given the spoilers in the reviews given by others, you can simply wait for the next book without feeling you are missing anything. If no other books come out, don't worry, you still aren't missing a thing as \\"nothing\\" was resolved and no main characters \\"evolved\\" in this book.<br /><br />If I met Mr Martin in real life, I'd slap him across the face and yell \\"words are winds, you know nothing, and I always repay my debts.\\" That would be more enjoyable than this book.
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|I am not impressed by this game. On my phone's 4.3&#34; screen, controls are sufficiently imprecise as to be aggravating (I'm guessing that the use of a stylus would help). Color and visual depth add to the experience, which  demonstrates that the developers cared about their production. But controls are too lackluster to prompt any more stars from me.

B00BD62X14|4.0|This is Bruni's best album since her debut, \\"Quelqu'un m'a dit\\" from ten years ago. In between, she detoured into a misguided effort to turn poems (by Yeats among others) into pop songs and a somewhat better album that had a more contemporary pop feel. Here, she returns to the acoustic idiom that made her first album such a delight and a surprise, and she's regained her sense of humor to boot - as her charmingly devastating song, \\"Le Pingouin,\\" a take down of France's new president, Francois Hollande, shows. (Although the song does betray a sort of patrician disdain for the \\"poorly brought up\\" and \\"egghead\\" socialist president]. Indeed, the modesty of the songs belies the fact that we're listening to artist increasingly comfortable singing about her jet-setting life (\\"Chez Keith et Anita\\" - as in Keith Richards' mansion in the south of France). Woody Guthrie, she's not.<br /><br />But the album plays to her considerable strengths as a singer and songwriter too. At their best, her songs provide a showcase for her soothing voice and display a genuine sense of tenderness and affection as in \\"J'arrive a toi\\" and her love-song to her current husband, Nicolas Sarkozy (France's ex-president), \\"Mon Raymond\\" (which is, melodically, a little too close to the love song she recorded for her first husband on her debut album. But I digress...) Bruni has charm to spare and she sure knows how to deploy it: her Franglais ode to French pop, \\"Little French Song,\\" is cuteness defined. And \\"Dolca Francia\\" - another highlight - translates Charles Trenet's classic 1930s tune into a languid endorsement of inter-cultural understanding. Although it doesn't quite match the beauty of her debut, \\"Little French Songs\\" shows Bruni increasingly comfortable within the soft-folk/chanson tradition that makes her best work so distinctive.

To his great credit, Clark faces that complexity head-on rather than trying to simplify or, even worse, produce one more reiteration of the \\"blame game,\\" in which one country is identified as the most guilty party to the catastrophe. Instead, he forgoes a blame-centered approach to look at the complex relationships between nations, and within each nation's governments, to understand how the assassination triggered the greater conflict. He likens it to looking at different nodes on a series of networks: at times, particular parties within one country would have greater influence than others and the way that they shaped policy and diplomacy narrowed the horizons for other countries' decision-making. Far from being inevitable or even probable, Clark's narrative stresses the highly contingent nature of diplomatic relationships in 1912-1914.<br /><br />Even more important is his insistence that we look at the Balkan context. Traditionally, histories of World War I start with the ongoing crisis between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Serbia, who resented the former's control of territory (Bosnia) where many Serbs lived, but then quickly shifts away to the other great powers (France, UK, Russia, Germany) once the drama starts to unfold. Here, however, Clark provides an extensive history of Serbia and shows how Serbian irredentism both drew in Austria-Hungary and Russia (Serbia's ally) into Balkan politics and how these, in turn, encouraged all the great powers to adopt more militaristic approaches to diplomacy.<br /><br />This book is quite juggling act - going between Serbian history and the diplomatic and political contexts of each of the major powers, he traces the shifting relations between each major players and even tries to show how the mass media shaped popular perceptions of the pre-war international crises, of which there were several, which constrained options for each countries' foreign ministries in their turn. Is it a bit too much at times? Yes. Clark struggles hard to keep such highly complex issues like the 1912-13 Balkan Wars clear but the shifting relations and power struggles between different countries (and political constituencies within each) does at times make for a bit of a slog. (The chapter isn't called \\"Balkan Entanglements\\" for nothing). And his admirable effort to take a nuanced view of every country's diplomatic stance leads him, despite many insightful interpretations, into a repetitive style which does get a little tedious at times. (The book also needs to be better proof-read before the paperback comes out).<br /><br />Still, as a one-volume effort to make sense of the July Crisis and to avoid the pitfalls of earlier scholarship, this is an extremely impressive book and certainly worthy of the effort it takes to get through some of it. Plenty of other books are coming out this year on 1914 but for sheer interpretative ambition and for his deftness in handling multiple strands of causality, this one is going to be hard to beat.

B0019O6IWU|5.0|This is the 2nd most powerful book I've ever read outside of the Bible. It has may a HUGE differences in the relationships in my life WHEN I practice it. Also, it could have a greater impact if you can find an NVC group to practice with. I've recommended this book to many people. Those choose to get the book, have commented in the affirmative about it's impact.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Intelligent introduction of the master sleuths to a new generation while staying true to those who have long followed this original dynamic duo.  Downey and Law are wonderfully paired leaving the audience to wonder who is having more fun with this movie, the players or the viewers.  They leave a door ajar for the obligatory sequel as well.
B00CMQX84A|4.0|According to the Deadline Hollywood site, Teen Beach Movie is the number 2 most-watched movie in cable TV history, after High School Musical 2. My guess is that, the new film, just released on DVD, has exceeded even Disney Channel's expectations.<br /><br />While Disney Channel remains a kids' cable powerhouse, its level of huge, phenomenon-generating sensations such as Hannah Montana and High School Musical are several years in the past. The channel has some big hits, particularly Phineas & Ferb, Gravity Falls and Disney Junior shows Sofia the First and Doc McStuffins, but TV viewership has changed dramatically since the last decade. That makes the high viewership of Teen Beach Movie an even more significant success.<br /><br />So how it make such a (forgive me) splash? I think people of all ages discovered that it was better than they expected, if not better than average for Disney Channel movies of the last few years. It's genuinely funny, colorful escapism, the kind of thing popular in the '60s and other periods in history when the country needed fun, silly stuff to take them away from economic and political issues.<br /><br />If you liked the Annette & Frankie beach movies, this movie has more than just overt references. The leading lady is going to be sent to \\"Dunwich Academy,\\" surely a nod to The Dunwich Horror, produced by American-International Pictures, the same low-budget, high-profit studio that made the seven \\"official\\" beach movies.<br /><br />The villain, parodying Vincent Price from such fluffy frolics as Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine. Like Price, his British accent is theatrical since this villain is really from Pittsburgh. Vincent Price was really from St. Louis.<br /><br />At the start of Teen Beach Movie, there's an iconic image for those who knows the original beach party films: a twisting young dancer dressed in frills -- certainly inspired by Candy Johnson, the \\"world's fastest twister,\\" who danced over the end credits of most AIP beach movies. (I hope that, if there is a sequel, no one second-guesses the inclusion of such nice touches because \\"No one will get it.\\"<br /><br />Teen Beach Movie is Grease without the viscosity. The humor is more in the farcical style of The Monkees TV series (right down to the Davy Jones-like twinkling eyes). There's virtually no innuendo.<br /><br />David Lawrence, son of Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, did the score and wrote some of the songs, a task he excelled at for the High School Musical movies. The songs on the soundtrack are a canny blend of '60s styles and contemporary teen pop mixes.<br /><br />Perhaps more than anything, Teen Beach Musical is a dance film -- more so than High School Musical. Director/choreographer Jeffrey Hornaday vast list of credits includes the Disney Parks attraction, Captain EO. Members of the cast are recognizable from such TV competitions as \\"So You Think You Can Dance?\\" The bonus rehearsal footage bears out the energetic dance moves as well as the talents of the cast.<br /><br />Don't expect Teen Beach Movie to be Jean-Luc Godard or Orson Welles. Just find a comfy chair and let it take you out on the surf. Even though the surf looks deliberately like it's been filmed against a green screen and no one's hair gets wet.movies.

B00CL6GAD2|3.0|Not a bad movie but a bit disappointing considering the star power.  A bit predictable and It ended with kind of a whimper.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This was a good interesting read. It was not overly preachy...just one woman's thoughts on her challenging circumstances. Entertaining and enjoyable.
B003SQVI54|5.0|I never watched this show until it went to TBS and now I'm addicted! I got a couple of the seasons from Amazon for a good price so I keep feed my addiction while the show is on hiatus. The cast of characters is so unique and witty that I find myself laughing out loud even when I'm alone. Now thats funny...
B000KK0AKU|5.0|Beautifully shot dark romantic drama set in mid-1980's New York. The chemistry between the actors couldn't have been better even though the story line isn't strong, it works within all the other components of the film. This is a very sexy adult movie that plays more on lust than love. Well worth it.

B005LAIGOQ|3.0|The Arthur Kipps with whom I was hitherto more familiar is the English character by H.G. Wells, who later inspired the musical, \\"Half a Sixpence\\".<br /> This one, played by a haunted yet stoic Daniel Radcliffe with relatively few lines and whose large, photogenic blue eyes are as wide as they were in the first \\"Harry Potter\\" film, is the creation of novelist Susan Hill, and also English.<br />  Performing in this 95-minute horror flick, which in some ways is not too much of a stretch for him, the former child star, rocking a pair of sideburns along with his short but athletic build, plays an Edwardian era  widower with a small son(Radcliffe's  sweet little real-life godson, Mischa Handley), and sometimes seems eager, at times overly eager, to proclaim his maturity to the world. The short, pert chin of that still adorably pinchable boyish face, which once buttressed baby-fat-filled cheeks as it lifted in awe to inspect a golden snitch is now stubble ridden as it inspects grimmer haunted surroundings. Certain camera shots seem to echo and overly emphasize the message, \\"I'm an adult now, and I have the body hair to prove it!\\"<br />  The tale begins with the inexplicable demise of the three Fisher Sisters(Emma Shorey, Molly Harmon,and Ellisa Walker-Reid), who suddenly, under mysterious possession, leave off from playing Tea Party with their dolls and jump to their deaths from the attic windows of their parents' inn amid the audible screams of their mother.<br />  Meanwhile in London, Kipps, a struggling  young attorney is sent to the costal area by train to settle a deceased client's estate, called Eel Marsh House where a vengeful veiled spirit haunts him  as it does the villagers, whose children also become possessed and engage in suicidal acts despite Kipps' frequent and futile attempts to save them. It is of some significance that his four-year-old has  drawn for him, a little calendar, marking the days leading to their scheduled Friday reunion.<br />  His most relevant acquaintance at this time is the prominent citizen, Sam Daily(Ciaran Hinds, who appeared with Radcliffe in the last two \\"Harry Potter\\" films), and his disturbed wife, Elizabeth(Janet McTeer)who still grieves the loss of their son, Nicholas(Sidney Johnston), who would have been the same age as Kipps had he lived.<br />  As the story continues, the young lawyer experiences a mounting level of social  castigation from the locals and is also haunted by a beautiful and benevolent woman in white, namely the spirit of his late wife(Sophie Stuckey) who died in childbirth.<br />  Scenes of him sifting through the correspondence that help him investigate the case with the malevolent spirit lurking about reminded me of  part of the following poem, \\"Antigonish\\" by William Hughes Mearns:\\"Yesterday, upon the stair, I saw a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish, I wish he'd go away.\\"<br />  The apparition of this woman( Liz White) who won't go away is later joined by the phantoms of her many young victims. But after gaining in-depth knowledge of the situation, Arthur, with Mr. Daily's help, literally gets down and dirty to bring resolution to the previously unsolved matter. But the spirit remains unforgiving, and she will restore everything Arthur holds dear to him in her own cruel way, creating a very poignant ending.<br />  I can't say I found this horror flick to be too scary at all, really. But Radcliffe's personal charm carries the story, and Director James Watkins provides another showcase for its young star's fabulous talent.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|I would say that most of the reviews I found on these headphones (Head-fi.org, Amazon, etc.) are tailored to the enjoyment of music played on these headphones, so I wanted to give my impressions as a sound designer and how this headphone applies to that field.<br /><br />Before I go off on my sound design critique I just wanted to add that these are some amazing headphones for music.  I was originally afraid that the bass on these would be weak (seeing as they make a q701 which is essentially the same headphone but with a thicker bass response), but honestly I love the bass on these.  It is clean clear and precise without being muddy or overdone.  I listen to mostly Electronic/Dance/EDM/Dubstep/Ambient/etc, which reviewers said the k702 would not be good for, but it is.  I personally love a flatter reference mix on my music rather than a colored or boosted response and these deliver that perfectly.<br /><br />So enough about the music.  I bought these for my work station where I am a sound designer (make audio for programs/videos/games/media) on the grounds of upgrading my headphones to something to something high quality.  I got tired of my \\"provided\\" decent headphone's sound quality and decided I would put in some money for a real headset for work.  These headphones are somewhat power intensive.  On an iPhone or headphone out most devices would not get a decent volume out of the k702s due to their higher power requirement.  This is not a total loss for me seeing as I knew this would happen in high quality headphones and invested in a rather cheap but effective amp (Fiio e09k).  The amp is more than enough power for these headphones and I just RCA the signal in from my Komplete Audio 6's headphones out.<br /><br />The first time listening to these on sounds and environments I had created already was truly eye opening.  Sounds and audio I had slaved over for hours sounded so much clearer and crisp than I had heard before in years of audio development using my multiple pairs of Sennheisers.  I immediately could pick out flaws I needed to clean up in my audio, and honestly I felt a little embarrassed to call myself a sound designer.  The clear sound of these headphones is astounding and probably the best bang for your buck for any sound designer.  I have owned many similar priced open and closed back Sennheisers and would say the k702s win by a landslide for sound development.  The flat response helps for making sure your sounds have all the right details you hope to deliver in creating a sound asset without the lies and boosted bass.<br /><br />I give these five stars based on price and quality.  As someone who listens to detailed audio daily I hope this review helps in the decision process for these headphones. They were worth every penny!le pairs of Sennheisers.

The story is elaborate and leaves the reader with a lot to think about. Its sequels are just as good, though Sabriel is my favorite.<br /><br />I have read it well over fifty times and I have begged every one of my friends to give it a try. My copies have been so well used that I have actually had to buy this book four times due to accidents that happen when you take a book everywhere. I finally just bought it digitally to save myself the heartache.

B00AGKHEUI|1.0|I purchased this Rumours 3 CD set NEW. Yet, all of the discs were scratched. I knew going into this purchase that because of the packaging there were likely going to be some imperfections with the discs. Because having dealt with these sort of digi-paks in the past there have always been scratches on the discs. That is why I try to avoid buying digi-paks. But the price was low enough that I figured... why not? I have the previous 2 disc set so, I was mainly buying this set for disc 2. Disc 1 wasnt too badly scratched, just a few light hairline marks toward the outer edge, no big deal. Then as I slowly removed disc 2 I instantly noticed many, and I mean MANY scratches. Disc 2 looked like it had been taken out and then shoved back in roughly, many, many, maaaaaaaannnnnnny times before. This disc had deep scratches going every which way... totally unacceptable for a product that is BRAND NEW. Disc 3 wasnt as bad as disc 2, it looked a little worse than disc 1, but at this point it didnt matter. At this point I felt like this entire digi-pak release was a total disgrace. [The previous 2 disc release was fine because it was in a jewel case.] A NEW product that looked anything but new. Would this sort of thing be acceptable if this had been a piece of furniture, like a table? Buy something new then open it to find scratches all over it. In both cases the scratches might only be cosmetic but it doesnt matter. When something is purchased NEW it should be/look NEW.

B008JFUO36|5.0|Not only is it an interesting movie concept, but somewhere along the way, Tom Cruise learned how to act.  He actually plays the part rather than the usual awful job he does in movies.  For years, I've avoided all his movies because he simply sucked as an actor.  I'd give this one a thumbs up.  And I love that the movie was filmed in Iceland.  Wow.  It's beautiful.

My requirements for a sudoku game app are various levels of difficulty (check), a pencil so that possible entries can be recorded and later erased (check) and entertaining enough that I am not bored or want to delete the app after only one play (check).<br /><br />It is not fancy but anyone who likes doing Sudoku puzzles will enjoy this app.

0061801313|4.0|My books arrived in great condition and I think this is a great deal for the price. The box they come in is a little flimsy and the covers and pages are very thin so it would probably be best not to let a caress person handle the books or the box but since the box just since on my book shelf anyway it's fine for me. The books themselves are very short as are the chapters and from what I've seen of the show and read of the book so far this probably is something you would give to an older teen. I myself am in my 20's but I couldn't imagine this being even remotely appropriate for someone younger than 15 and some parents may not even be comfortable with that. The girls in these books have sex, smoke, drink, steal, date older men and even teachers. As I said the books are very short so to any parents whose children ask for these books I would strongly suggest you get them from the library and read them yourselves before deciding if you think this is appropriate for your teen.

B00DL47RQ2|5.0|If Cate Blanchett isn't short-listed for this year's Best Actress at the Oscars, there is no justice. As a matter of fact, in this assembly of award-winning actors directed by the perennial Woody Allen, there is not one weak performance.<br /><br />I sat in the theater marveling at the talent and skill on display. Blanchett (from Australia) and Hawkins (from the U.K.) play American sisters without a hint of accent. Furthermore, no one in this film had to do that irritating Woody Allen stammer. This is one of Allen's most accessible films since \\"Match Point.\\"<br /><br />Look at this cast:<br />  * Cate Blanchett (\\"Hanna\\") is the pampered wife of an extremely successful New York businessman, her life suffers a cataclysmic shock and she loses touch with reality, so she seeks shelter with her divorced sister. (She has won an Oscar among many other honors.)<br />  * Alec Baldwin (\\"Rock of Ages\\") is her husband, suave, handsome and (we can tell) smarmy. Baldwin relishes roles like this. (He has won numerous Emmys.)<br />  * Sally Hawkins (\\"Made in Dagenham\\") is her sister, a single parent in a tiny walk-up, but willing to try to help. (She won a Golden Globe.)<br />  * Bobby Cannavale (\\"Win Win\\") plays another ebullient character, outspoken, honest and very appealing. (He won an Emmy.)<br />  * Andrew Dice Clay (\\"Entourage\\") is our gal's former brother-in-law; he has a way of condensing all of her faults into three statements. (He won a Razzie(!)<br />  * Peter Sarsgaard (\\"An Education\\") walks into our gal's life just in the nick of time! (He won BSFC Award.)<br /><br />This excellently crafted PG-13 script slowly unveils events in Jasmine's past. We couldn't help but hear the mature-man/teenage-lover defense with Mr. Allen's notorious past in mind, and some of the relationships evoked echoes of Tennessee Williams' \\"Streetcar...\\" Between Allen and Blanchett, they have created a realistic and relatable melt-down!<br /><br />I love it when there are no bad guys or good guys, just people with human failings and various levels of desperation, trying to get by. Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.

B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Not a bad song here with tasty melodies, gritty guitars & harmonies, awesome rhythm work and great vocals from the new guy that are thoughtful, well phrased and incredibly delivered.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Tom Cruise is at his best when given a good script to work with. He doesn't disappoint here. Great movie
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app. I use it nearly every night. The free downloads for new sounds makes the purchase worth it. I don't think I've ever used the actual white noise sound, because this app offers so many.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Trouble With the Curve is a really nice movie that takes place in a small town.  It's basically a light comedy and a light drama for that matter about scouting the best baseball players for the major league, but what elevates the movie to greatness probably has to do with the actors/actresses, which are all really spectacular and deserving of their big name well-known success.<br /><br />You can probably guess the biggest one I'm going to mention since he's sort of legendary- Clint Eastwood!  He's wonderful.  He plays a grumpy old scout that has vision problems, but that doesn't prevent him from acknowledging the bigger picture- that he has a talent for knowing the good players from the bad.  Listen up young men- take Clint's advice since he's been around for a while.  His daughter is the center of the storyline.  Played by the beautiful and charming Amy Adams, she's constantly fighting and bickering with her father concerning her troubled childhood and why Clint Eastwood basically gave her away as a child, as well as informing people that she's more suitable for the scouting job than anyone else in that office.  Her baseball knowledge is just incredible.<br /><br />Robert Patrick is one of the more underrated actors and a personal favorite of mine (DARN IT for the Unit being cancelled so soon!).  Justin Timberlake -while I'm certainly not a fan of his music, he plays a genuine good guy/boyfriend of Amy Adams in this movie.  We all John Goodman for his role in the Flintstones.  Haha, just kidding.  Roseanne all the way!  Bob Gunton- yes I recognize him from the hit TV show 24.  Matthew Lillard is the man who plays the guy everyone hates, being a know-it-all jerk and everything.  We want to see him make wrong decisions and take his walking papers!<br /><br />Basically Trouble With the Curve is one of those feel-good type family movies that does everything correctly.  It's a movie that probably plays it safe with the storytelling more often than not, and any boring moments are occasional and quickly veer in a more constructive/enticing direction so there's always something to look forward to.  Perhaps light on substance, but again, the big name actors/actresses makes up for that tiny flaw.  Overall, quality movie.
B0085A9HXS|4.0|This has to be one of the most hyped movies ever, so I finally saw it and expected my mind to be blown. Was it? No. Did I like it? A lot, it is a pretty good, exciting, gut wrenching movie, particularly near the end, but given all the hype I was expecting a lot more. It does not disappoint, but it is a little bit overrated.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I managed to get half way through this book and had to stop because it was pissing me off. I really enjoyed the first two, but the third one just didn't hold my interest. I found the dynamic between Eva and Brett to be completely inappropriate. At this point, I cannot get on board with reading the other two books planned in this series. I doubt I'll even be able to finish this one. Eva comes across as wishy washy and incapable of being faithful. I can't root for Eva and Gideon as a couple anymore and that makes me sad.
B003FCKI3E|5.0|what can I say it really does make you enjoy everything about the film and ROCKS! Sequel anyone? maybe someday?
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|The characters are wonderful and the story is lovely.  I did not give it 5 stars because it was just a little too whisical for me but the I enjoyed it very much.
B00000AF98|5.0|I love this release not only  because it is their finest work but because 1987 was my favorite year and Eric Carr really shines on this album.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great, mindless game. Very easy to play for hours. Never is it too easy or is it ever too hard. One of those games that you'll be trying to help with a little body English.
1594745692|5.0|The product shots were entirely accurate, and the item just as high-quality as I had hoped. Even the box is nice!
B005N0C0JQ|5.0|Let me preempt this by saying I am huge Oasis fan. That being said...this album rivals anything Noel and Liam ever did...this includes \\"What's the story morning glory?\\". Listen to \\"If I had a gun\\" and you will see what I'm referring to. The more I listen to this album the more I say to myself the breakup of Oasis was for a reason. If you like great music...not just good music...try this out. You will not be disappointed.
B005544V6A|5.0|Awesome Show!!! it will have you looking forward to the next episode!! Don't miss out!! a must see TV show..
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Love, LOVE season four. Each season gets better and better! Bring on the next season! Must Watch TV! w00t! w00t!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book, as well as the follow up.  I am on the third book,<br />&#34;Mockingjay&#34;, which is a bit dragged out.  The first two books in this<br />series are great.
B00992CF6W|4.0|nephew loves this game and it keeps him busy for a little while so i can get some things done around the house.
B005D63ICI|5.0|(no spoilers) After season 4 i thought there was no way to have a more intense season, but yeah season 5 proved that wrong. It's just a well written season with good characters and a good story. Loved it from start to finish.
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|great game for my nephew to play on my kindle-fire and he is seven years old--it keeps him busy and he really likes it!
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|i've always been a fan of this game! I played on my pc but its just as fun on my kindle fire.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|nephew loves this game and it keeps him busy for a little while so i can get some things done around the house.
1408845040|5.0|The book itself was pretty new, the story inside is hilarious! I don't read a lot of books but this one is great. I hope you will have the chance to share the same opinion as me
B002RI9PKO|4.0|I haven't finished reading the book yet, but i found the content really interesting. I feel a little bit less dumb.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can someone please help me, I just need you to tell me what the code is for level two! Please!
0064471837|5.0|Set in a world where the dead rise and prey on the living, this trilogy follows the two women from the Abhorsen bloodline. The Abhorsen is charged with putting the dead to rest and making sure they stay dead.<br />The characters are all fully developed with fascinating backstories, as is the world they inhabit. If you consider yourself a fan of fantasy, then there is no excuse for not reading this series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so addicted to this game! the sounds and characters are so fun. love those little minions :)<br />still trying to figure out how to get more tokens with out having to buy them... but the challenges are fun and always update when you meet you goal.  the runs are always different and keep you on your toes.<br />did I mention how fun it is to see all the characters in the game? &lt;3
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Jordan is dead, Martin only cares about HBO...  Erikson is finished with his, Rothfuss is taking his time...  What's a fan of epic fantasy to do?!<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson to the rescue.  He's already earned my respect for reviving the Wheel of Time series and giving it a satisfying conclusion.  I was leery of him because I'm not incredibly interested in the Mistborn stuff, so I came into this book skeptically to say the least.  He floored me.<br /><br />This is epic, high fantasy at its finest.  The story is engaging and interesting from the first page, the characters are charming and fascinating, the writing is clear and concise.  No three-page long expositions of the dishes at a feast and a character's velvet-slashed doublet here.  Just good solid writing, awesome brutal conflict, and raw unromantic emotion.<br /><br />Fantasy needs more books like this and more writers like Sanderson.  He's a machine, pushing out books consistently.  He's a REAL writer, not a hobbyist or an aging TV writer enjoying his moment in the spotlight.  And he's got a story to tell.  The only warning I might offer is that he's usually in the middle of about half a dozen projects at any moment, so don't expect new books every year.  But I think we will all be satisfied with this one.  READ THIS BOOK.
B006S08RLU|4.0|Like so many French movies, this was well written with a dry sense of humor.  Once you start watching you can't stop.  My wife had other things to do and was not going to watch it, but she sat down for ten minutes and was hooked.
B005PK57IK|5.0|&#34;It's a Good Show&#34; my co-worker told me, as she is the one that uses our work account to watch it.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|my wife and I loved this series in the 1970s and it still is good - funny at times, not too serious and just an overall good time little violence yet keeps your attention
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Those interesting in the Secret and manifesting need to try the nine experiments that prove your thoughts create things and our world around us
B0014D6PCO|5.0|The first of the Christian Bale/Christopher Nolan trilogy.  After re-watching several times, it is my favorite of the three.  Highly recommended!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|An excellent show. Can't wait to go through the entire series. Great character development and Vick Mackie treads a perfect fine line between a cop on the take and uses his connections to fight crime.
B002L5KKK2|5.0|I heard my boss and a male colleague talking about it. Watched it. Good movie for guys and counselors. Things guys learn from the streets and female counselors should know about.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Our 21 month old boys loved it and it was fun seeing them have such a good time.  Too bad a nighttime animal decided they didn't like it and tore it up.  We are thinking of trying again maybe with a motion detector spotlight to chase off the possum or raccoon. Would definitely recommend though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm addicted to this fabulous game. It deserves 8 stars in my opinion, but you have to see it for yourself!
0064471837|5.0|I actually listened to this on tape, when I was commuting a few hours to and from home every day.  I normally do not prefer books on tape, but this was an extreme circumstance and I'm not someone who likes to go without reading.  I remembered a friend suggesting this series to me when I was in high school, so I decided to give it a try.  I loved this book so much, that it helped give me a reason to be awake at 4 in the morning for my drive to work.<br /><br />The story in this book is one that will remain with me always.  It is one of the few that I have bought just so I will be able to give it to my son when he is old enough to enjoy it.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the characters he created for this story.  They were so real, it was as if I was reading events that had actually occurred.<br /><br />This is one story I will read over and over again, and will recommend to fantasy lovers.<br /><br />5/5 platypires.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Take the time to read this book - you'll never regret learning more about one of the most creative, brilliant, artistic, real, brutally honest employer, tough/difficult friend & father... and so much more.  Steve Jobs was probably the closest our generation will ever come to knowing someone that will go down in history like such names as Einstein, Picasso, Lincoln, Newton, Michael Angelo and any other inventor, artist, creator, leader of their generation.  Absolutely a fascinating individual that makes you wish you had the opportunity to know - but not necessarily be one of his closest friends.  Enjoy!
B009R659L8|5.0|Great read from MHC!  Always look forward to reading her books and this one did not disappoint!  Looking forward to her next.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I was taken in by Cheryl's ability to stick with her desire to explore who she was after a tough childhood, young marriage she wasn't ready for and the heartbreak of loosing her mother so young.  It's a raw look at young woman who faced her inner demon's in a unique but interesting way - I'm not sure I'd take a journey on the PCT but loved hearing her stories and reading about her growth and adventure.  I'm really glad I read her story (it was way better than Eat, Love, Pray - BORING).  Enjoy!
B00DURGZHW|4.0|It is Nice to finally see a movie that is unique for a change.  I Bought it to watch again.
0525478817|5.0|Although I still believe Looking For Alaska is his best, this is a powerful and complex novel, more than worth the time and money; nobody makes me care about fictional characters quite like John Green.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|You never know what is going to happen in each episode and it is never boring, I love it. Great Show
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg you guys have to play this game so addicting just like candy crush saga DOWNLOAD IT LOVE IT SO MUCH
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|A great classic movie. One of my favorites. Amazon has several movies I have purchased. Gary Cooper is one of the all time great actors.  One of the best.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show. The characters grip you and don't let go. There are devastatingly sad moments but also joy. Acting is top notch. You forget you're watching fiction. Engaging!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|This show is great! - I enjoy it, but my wonderful husband is more than addicted. Keep up the great work!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|It's very basic. For a free app it is perfectly adequate. I have only used it once. Time will tell how useful it might become.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg I would play this game for hour and hour and hours it the coolest greatest game ever ever kid adult and mid teen wants to play this is the best game ever
B00296A4F4|5.0|I love Glee! I'm like really addicted to this show now that me and my friend started watching it alot.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game. I love the story line and would like to get full version for free, along with other G5 games.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Had heard so many people talking about this.  And I vaugely remember watching the original as a child.  Not sorry I checked it out.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Perfect. Not written  by or for idiots. Maggie Smith is so good. Get involved with these people. Need more stars
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This is a awesome watch and i got an excellent Amazon price. I would suggest if you need a great watch this is then one
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This is a very fine timer app. It is loaded with options such as the ability to run several timers simultaneously. The stopwatch and the alarm are very easy and quick to start up. Visually all the functions are very easy to read. I use this on my Note 2 with no problems. If you are looking for a timer so this one is worth checking out.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I read this because it was my book group's choice for last month. If it hadn't been, and if I hadn't paid for it to be on my Kindle, I might not have finished it. I had trouble following what they were trying to do, and the protagonist seemed a bit unrealistic.
B00EE3HVMO|4.0|I knew within the first ten minutes that this series is one I would follow. I could feel the tension, the suspense, as mom awakens after dreaming her son was on a cliff. As the morning moves on, she discovers that her son, Danny is missing. He has not been to school, did not go to his paper boy job, and doesn't answer his phone. She soon finds out her boy has died.<br /><br />DI Alec Hardy has been on the job a week in this pleasant seaside town. Crime rate is low and we learn that he has had some problem with a previous case. He is brusque but efficient. He wants everything done correctly. He is called to the beach where the body of a boy has been found.<br /><br />DI Ellie Miller,  played by Olivia Coleman is superb. She returns from a three week vacation to find her promotion has been given to another, DI Hardy. She is very angry and frustrated, with no time to deal with her feelings she is called to the beach where she recognizes the young man who has died. There she meets DI Hardy for the first time.<br /><br />There you have it, each person has a story, and we are in for quite a ride. I keep hearing that the end is shocking. I think I know who the killer is, we will soon find out!<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-08-13
B0090EJ99A|1.0|I feel I just watched crap in a toilet for the duration of the movie. This movie is not funny..
159420411X|2.0|Silver is a self-described statistician and economist, and boasts a bachelor's degree in economics. He is not a scientist. The book is full of interesting anecdotes about baseball, poker, and political elections. It is when he ventures into climate science that he shows his shortcomings.<br /><br />In Silver's description of the Climategate scandal ( see [[ASIN:1450512437 Climategate: The Crutape Letters]]) he bought into the straw-man argument that it was all about the temperature product of the British scientists at the Hadley Center and the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit (CRU).<br /><br />The Climategate scandal had nothing to do with the global temperature product, the greenhouse effect, or basic climate science about which most people agree.  Climategate is all about how some prominent scientists fudged data, erased embarrassing results, and sought to control the pier review process in leading scientific journals to suffocate dissenting opinions. All Sliver had to do was to research the event, but instead interviewed de-frocked climate scientist Michael Mann, and NASA climate modeler Gavin Schmidt.<br /><br />Silver defends Mann's science in the basis of so-called investigations where not one complainant was interviewed. Mann's onerous science was excused by his friends and colleagues, just like cops and doctors have historically defended their own. A little research reveals that Mann's investigations were white-washes, perpetrated by a Penn State administration that had established an alarming pattern of covering-up the sins of faculty and staff.<br /><br />Silver presents an interesting discussion of various types of climate forecast models. Where he goes astray is that he did not do an effective evaluation. His source of information about the climate models seem to have come from Gavin Schmidt whose salary depends on how well his computer models perform. It is interesting that Silver did not discuss that obvious dimension. Most climate scientists admit that the model temperature predictions are running too hot, and thus have serious problems. Silver tries to sell you that the models are, on the whole, fairly accurate. He doesn't tell you that the models miss the mark substantially when compared to actual measured temperature data over five and ten year periods.<br /><br />I liked the book except for his obvious shortfall in science knowledge. If you are interested in poker, or predicting political elections, this is your book. Science? Not so much.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|And definitely not safe for kids. Scary! Slow start and emphasis on special effects without enough plot and character development.
1591845556|2.0|First of all, the subtitle \\"How to learn anything . . . fast\\" is misleading. This book is about **skill** acquisition, not book learning. While chapter 3 does address knowledge acquisition, it's only about knowledge that serves as a basis for acquiring or improving a **skill**.<br /><br />Second, of the 280+ pages of text, only about 25 are actually about the process of acquiring new skills; the rest of the book consists of a series of six \\"How I Did It\\" stories that read more like basic tutorials than applications of the author's methods.<br /><br />Finally, while those 25 pages do contain some good advice, much of the content is general, repetitious, heavily dependent on material readily available from other sources, and mostly common sense.<br /><br />Besides, you can get the core of what the author has to offer - the checklists - from the \\"Look Inside this Book\\" page, right here on Amazon. Save your money!
0783230079|5.0|I have always loved this movie and still watch it when the weather keeps me inside. It's great and I recommend it to anyone.
B00181JGI2|5.0|What a great little trip of a movie. No big axe to grind, just a pleasant little detour on the road of life. Fun from start to finish.
0679643362|5.0|I was given this book as a gift from a friend and had to purchase it for a gift for someone else
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|I think when Deb found out, they stepped over the line. Maybe it was when she decided she was in love with her brother. Somewhere in here I think it started to feel like they lost their way.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I was wholeheartedly impressed with the quality of this app.  Easily the best looking program I've seen on my Kindle Fire HD.  The graphics are beautiful, the sound quality and voice-overs are better than what I've seen in the console versions, and the controls are downright intuitive.  I highly recommend this program.
B002B3D2TU|5.0|Once again David Garrett has given us the \\"best\\" of his sold-out performances.  His choice of music and collaborators is amazing!  Anytime I play \\"Music\\" on my iPhone, people stop me to listen and want to know who's playing that amazing violin!  I can't say which tracks are my favorites because each one is more fabulous than the next.  I highly recommend each track!  Do yourself or a friend a big favor and buy this album for everyone you care about.  You won't be sorry!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I found the book stripped of hype and false promises, whilst delivering the fundamental truths about muscle gain and correct dieting. Simple and refreshing, with potential for all ages.
0525425764|5.0|This was a father's day present and he loves it!  Grisham is oine of his favorite authors. Thank you much.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Awesome movie! Hulk SMASH the box office!! Tons of action and awesome fighting scenes. Thor and his brother Loki was the star of the show.
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|My 8 year old gives it five stars and would give more if he could. I wish they were free to view like the Legos videos though so he only gets to watch occasionally.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|An awesome shark experience.  Fictional and fun.  Easy to use and level up.  Would recommend for ages 7+ Can be challenging too.
B000OWAFPE|5.0|I liked the story because it shows that one small penguin can help the entire eco system if he or she tries hard enough. It is an ideal show for small kids in the pre-teen and teen year. Graphic and story is wonderful.<br /><br />Brian
B008HK3XOU|5.0|LOVE my kindle fire HD!!!!  and the red case is GREAT!!!!<br />I love the black/white lettering its sooo easy to read~
B000ID3KU6|5.0|I have seen this movie more than a few times. I feel it is all about the death of the gunman in the west. The change accrues with the coming of the railroad to the wilderness of the old west. The train is bringing civilization as we all know it to be, and you can see it starting off with the money people bringing in the hired gun to get things done; and then seeing one by one the elimination of these gunslingers by men who understand that there own time is coming to an end. The location out west and the music is very good. The actors are all very good too.<br /><br />brian
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gone Girl is still my favorite by far, but considering this was her first novel I am impressed.  I have read all 3 of her books and she is a gifted writer who knows how to grab you and keep you involved.  This family was beyond dysfunctional and the characters were complex.  I can't wait for her next book to come out.  GILLIAN FLYNN is batting 100 so far in my book!
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie as it helps non-birders get a feel for what drives us birders, the behavior they may have considered weird now has some context. Also, hopefully they can understand the knowledge base that is required and the need for study of not just the bird identification but climate, habitat, flora and fona, geography, modes of travel, how to survive in the wild etc etc. In addition, this is funny and charming; not just Steve Martin but all the characters
B009CG25RO|3.0|I watch this on my playstation 3 and my samsung smarttv and the resolution pops back and forth from HD to standard def throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />It's a huge bummer, because this is actually one of my absolute favorite movies.<br /><br />Looks like Amazon needs to download some better codec packs ;)
1412960991|5.0|This is my most useful research text.<br />Good sample tables and plenty of 'how to's.<br />I keep coming back to this one.
B006QKJQM6|5.0|Another awesome movie from Dreamworks. It's got the best of kung fu and great characters. A good movie for anybody.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Such a lovely modern day love story.<br /><br />I read it in a day as I just was so invested in the characters, I didn't want to stop.<br /><br />It's a boy meets girl, girl has daddy issues, detective love story.<br /><br />Loved it.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|One night my mom sent to sleep and i was furious to go to my bed and she said if you dont go to bed im going to hit you so hard your going to forget it  so i  said yes mam. so she said good thats what i want to here so i went to sleep and i started to have these really bad dreams and i kept pitching and i start to cry and i was so sleepy i could go to sleep for nothing and thats how come i started to get so scared the other night to and it was obvious so thats why i started having bad dreams
1400067820|5.0|If you consider youself as an intellectual fragelista, you must read this book. The author is a great thinker of our time,I'll put him ahead on any other thinker I ever read...even plato.
B00622B3MY|5.0|FINN is his hero.  Can't live in our house without this movie.  Even nods off to sleep on the couch watching this in the evening sometimes.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|It is very different music from NIN's.  They should make another CD.<br />The girl that is singing sounds so HOOOOOOOT!!!!
B0073PPNE8|5.0|One of my favorites.  The story and the historical backdrop are terrific.  Renea Zillwegger is wonderful as well as the rest of the cast
B003N7GATM|5.0|If you like Nine Inch Nail, you'll probably like this s***!! buy it, I don't know why they don't play this on the radio, instead of all the other same old s***
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Result: My son was disappointed! He was really looking forward to it and I tried to install it a couple of times but it just wouldn't.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary is very informative and gives good details about Americans and the other what-nots. It gives info about the land, our sayings, and basic AMERICAN words.
B008Y6S07M|4.0|It does not use foul language (except for &#34;shut up&#34;) :) and it has a great premise.  Will Smith and his son did a great job.
0385523394|4.0|I raced through this book in one day, partly because I was mesmerized, especially in the first half of the book where Piper Kerman writes about her crimes and the terrifying experience of getting locked up, and partly because some of the middle sections had more detail than I was interested in so I was skimming. Those sections are still worth reading, there's a lot about the relationships she developed with other inmates, and the eye-opening,  riveting parts of the book more than make up for what's less interesting. It's a gripping, cautionary tale. The choices she made in her early to mid-20's that led to prison are not so different, in kind if not degree, from the sorts of dumb mistakes a lot of us make when we're young. Her account of life in prison, which is both worse and better than I pictured, is a civic education. Reading the book gave me a visceral sense of what losing my freedom would feel like, a fascinating exercise that I hope to only live vicariously.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this.  I cant stop playing only if I could get more energy faster I would like it even better
0307951154|5.0|I just love Jo Nesbo's books. Read several. Saving this for special treat. He is one of my very favorites.
B001J29H9I|5.0|only downside is that it's just a 6 track EP.  Solid CD.  Highly recommended.  My favorite Black Keys CD for sure.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Truly inspires you to be a better man, husband, and father. The worlds problems would end overnight if we as men could live by the lessons taught in this film.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I was excited to hear the story of the studio and all the artists that came through but the collaboration of some incredible artists at the end was something you don't get to normally see. If your a music fan this is a must watch documentary.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This is John Grisham at his best!!  I read this book for the first time more than 10 years ago and now I'm re-reading it.  It's as good the second time
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Great Book, need to read and reread!  So many valuable lessons to be learned from reading this great book.  Thank you!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|What social networking has come to in the digital age.  When I realized I already had a 'real' interaction with my FB friends prior to FB, but to learn now that doesn't happen....strange.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Works exactly as it is listed, we have had no problems with it. We would recommend it to others and would buy it again if we needed to!
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Shooting is a bit awkward, and you have to pay for coins...That earned you only three stars.  However, the graphics are cute and when you lose, th Dragon reminds me of my grandson and his drama when he &quot;loses&quot;.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Read this book because a friend suggested it. Really enjoyed the realism of the story and a good reminder on how we need to look at people from the inside out.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|Very similar to the others but I even almost cried in a transfomer movie I could not even beleive it!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Nice documentary on music history and how Sound City studios was behind many of the great albums over the years.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is such a fun app. It can be challenging and a little frustrating at times, but its a great way to kill time between activities.
B008JFUO36|4.0|and though I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan in the world he seems to never make a bad movie.<br />He appears to give all he's got to give his audience the best product he can produce, so that's the only reason I really watch what he does.<br /> He don't appear to be just walking through his roles just to make money, he looks like he likes what he does for a living, and that must be great because most people hate what the \\"F\\" they do for a living.<br />Also I've heard this movie was mostly filmed in Iceland, what a beautiful and brutal looking place. How the hell did the Vikings ever survive there?.<br /> Maybe that's the reason why they were such bad asses.<br /> I don't think I seen one tree there, it literally looks like another planet.<br />Anyway, Morgan Freeman was as good as always and the always super hot looking Olga Kurylenko was great in it also, the story was good and I think the movies definitely worth watching, so if you like science fiction check it out.<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game so much I can't stop playing. Every time l run out of coins I get so mad because I have to wait to get more
B005U9REU0|4.0|Love it.<br />Love Bowie<br />Love Jim Hensen<br />That being said I hadn't seen it for a while, and find it a little dated but my 7 yr old loved it and that was what was really important.
B0000029GA|5.0|To start, this album hands down is one of the best albums you would ever hear, even today. The way it was produced, ranging from the greats like DJ Premier to Pete Rock. Mixing the beats with Nas and his vivid rhymes, you have a master piece. This album has a right to called a master piece. To top it off, NY State of Mind is one of best tracks on the album, that was the second track. Nas is one of the greatest rapper alive. You have to order this album if you are a hip-hop head.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Great acting, solid story line.  Check this series out and watch it! The actress is amazing in her many roles.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game. I got addicted to it as soon as I played it. I also like that it don't freeze up like if I played it on my computer.
034552554X|5.0|This is a wonderful book - who knew that flowers had such specific meanings.  The story skips around and kept me hanging until the end to figure everything out.  I think this is one of those books that could be read and enjoyed multiple times.
B00DJZ06DO|4.0|First, yes this version is obviously a bootleg of some sort.  That was the reason I purchased it because based on descriptions of the plot line for Evangelion 3.33 I wasn't ready to put down $75 on what seemed to be a poorly plotted installment of the series.  Sadly, I found that my poor expectations were realized.<br /><br />I give this version 4 stars because this bootleg is a reasonable value for your money. It was $25 when I purchased it and the price has gone down since. The packaging and the disc are reasonably professionally done. Its features are VERY BASIC. It is Japanese w/ english subtitles.  The DVD menu only has 2 options: 1. Play Feature 2. Subtitles.  It should be noted that after I used the DVD menu option to set the subtitles I had to use the subtitle button on my remote to actually see them. (I was on a PS3)<br /><br />*Warning Some minor spoilers*<br />However, watching the film validated my reason for buying a bootleg.  I was terribly disappointed in the plotline for 3.33 and I would have been VERY UNHAPPY if I had spent $75 for this episode.  The whole 14 years later idea seemed like a bad idea, but not impossible to pull off with good writing.  Unfortunately, they didn't meet the bar.  The storyline is actually 14 years after events which would be the equivalent of \\"End of Evangelion\\" in the reboot. We never got to see those events and the references to what happened are cryptic and sparse.  Actions in the plotline happen without explanation of any type of purpose which makes them seem random. There is no rationale given for rescuing Shinji from space given the situation. There appears to be little character development in Asuka's character given the 14 years that have elapsed. People who really ought to know better inexplicably treat Shinji in a manner which seems designed to produce the worst possible results even after they've gone to enormous lengths to rescue him.  No real attempt is made to explain the critical new political alignments inthis new world. After a while it all becomes moot because events are no longer driven by rationality and instead they are driven by the demons of Shinji's tortured psyche.  We've all seen where that goes in the original series.<br /><br />This episode was made less than comprehensible by bad writing.  If you intend to shift the entire world order then you need to make a reasonable and clear attempt to explain how we got from where we were in the last episode to where we are now. They failed in this effort.  After the end of this I still didn't understand what was going on and who the major players were. I could obviously do a lot of speculation with very little supporting basis, but that shouldn't be where the viewer is after a film.<br /><br />If I had been rating this only based on the film and not the version I would have given it 3 stars. But like any other devotee of the series it was inevitable that I was going to buy this film so I am happier to have spent less money on it.  I can hope that the next installment gets better.<br /><br />Thanks.. Hope this is helpful to someone.
B005D0TETA|5.0|This Bluray was such a pleasure to watch! Yes performed in 2001 with local symphonies in various cities. This captures one of the performances.<br />It is a real pleasure to see most of the classic Yes members perform together many of the pieces that had not been performed without Steve Howe. You can see the fun & snyergy between the band and the symphony! The best YEs is when they perform live and this is a great moment captured in the perfect format!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Too focused on the political context of JC time... Silent on the context of spirituality and faith. Still a good comparative read to more traditional texts.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Nemo's Reef is one of very few games I have been able to play over a length of time--the past four months.  It is fun and keeps my attention, and at the same time, it provides a little challenge (and I'm 21).  Additionally, the great thing about it is that \\"cheats\\" and such are rarely up-to-date, which allows you to play with more individuals who have earned his/her level instead of having typed a cheat code in.<br />The only downfall I have had while playing is the need for others to accept and complete co-op quests.  Especially once the point of needing about 5+ friends to complete them is reached, it gets real difficult to get enough players to even accept.  /:<br />I still enjoy attracting new fish and acquiring new plants to grow!
1608871517|5.0|Others have written beautifully about this book already, so I am just going to say it's all true.  A beautiful coffee table book with great photos and personal stories shared by Michael Bush.  Definitely not overdone....I would have enjoyed more.  The inspirations of Jackson are well documented along with the artful interpretation of his vision and the extreme talent of both Bush and Tompkins to pull off some of the most elaborate costumes is nothing short of fabulous and fascinating.  A must have for true MJ fans.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Better than Magic Academy and other HO games because you are less inhibited by NOT spending real money! Plus more mini-games and things OTHER than HO!  I do wish Big Fish/G5 would throw more bones to free players once in a while!
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini writes a touching story.  Easy to understand the characters and empathize.  Excellent character development and easy to get hooked in.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I am a huge Jane Austen fan.  have most of her books in hard cover, but the Kindle makes it easy to travel with.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Too bad - this could have been a great movie.  The premise of the movie is classic sci-fi; creative and exciting.  The first 30-60 minutes keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Then the script devolves into yet another mediocre sci-fi horror flick trying to copy Alien.  Too bad - after the great setup, I expected much more.<br /><br />Also, the characters get terminally brain-dead during the second half of the movie.  An example is the rolling spaceship disc scene where the idiots keep running straight along the trajectory of the rolling craft rather than running to the side.  It was such a stupid scene that it made me laugh out loud.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This is a nifty device.  No longer have to clean off multiple finger prints from the screen.  Great help for typing.
B001JNNDEW|3.0|Some humorous moments, but like most things in life,  not as funny<br />and laugh loaded as I recalled from earlier days.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|It seems like its a bit too big for my nex-3n  so I end up putting it on its side.  Being that its a universal bag it's to be expected but it does have enough space for anything you will need it for.
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel when I was 12, I loved the book then, and I still love it whenever I re-read it now. It's a coming-of-age story with dark fantasy and action-adventure that would appeal to girls and boys. Sabriel is a realistic character-- she's been trained to vanquish the dead and can do her job, but she's young and new to it and is understandably scared as she goes off on her great adventure. I would recommend this book to mature young readers and teens who like dark fantasy or high fantasy. The rest of the series and all of Garth Nix's other work is great as well, so if you like Sabriel, consider picking up one of his other books as well.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|For nothing really! It's a very confusing narration - not a cohesive story! It was chosen for our book club so I had to read it but I'm still not through reading the full book!! I have to really make an effort to read it though a lot of people in our book club liked it.
B004R63MWQ|2.0|Boring. Felt like they were trying to update the original but the story line was not conducive to expansion. No go
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has earned its place in my short list of very favorites.  I don't know how it was possible, but the author managed to write a book about teenagers battling (and losing their battles to) cancer that is laugh-out-loud funny.  I was laughing through constantly flowing tears, however.  This book touched me in a way that few have, and when I finished it I just sat there, quietly smiling and staring at the last words.

B00CA6WLAE|5.0|these books should be a bestseller.the series are unlike any fairy tale ever created.i highly suggest u read this book.
1781162646|5.0|I've got a soft spot for stories in which a middle aged or older character writes about what it is to be young.  I don't know why.  I just do.  I've also just finished writing one (sort of), so that's part of it.  But when you take a writer who does character so beautifully, and you get a reminiscence novel from them, well, that's a special thing indeed.<br />Also, I don't know if it's just practice, or that brush with death (ok, it was more than a \\"brush,\\" much more), or what.  I used to love Stephen King's novels and characters, but I hated his endings.  I just hated them.  Either I saw them coming (The Shining) or they just made no stupid sense to me (It).  But something has changed.  I watched \\"Bag of Bones\\" thinking I'd love the characters and hate the ending: wrong.  I read 11/22/63 expecting same: wrong.  So I started Joyland without expectations.  I don't know how to say this about a \\"hard case\\" crime/horror novel, but, geez, this book is beautiful.  The story inspires love and longing of all the best kinds.  And I didn't see the ending coming until very late in the book and then I wasn't sure and I didn't WANT to see it coming because, like the young man our narrator once was, I had grown to love the characters.  How did he DO that?
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I love this album.  Great to listen too when I am reading.  I would recomend this album.  Good music, easy listening.
B003R4ZMJU|2.0|I can't watch any more shows where all the characters look like models. I suppose that this is the entire point of this show. Perhaps I'm too old or just not interested, but I happen to think that these types of shows don't encourage the standards of beauty I want to see more of -- real women who are celebrated for their beauty inside and out. I wish there were more shows like that.

B00DH1G7DS|3.0|This is a nice faotd with very few permissions.  The game plays fine on my kindle fire and does have four levels of difficulty available. You can take notes.<br /><br />The positives end there.  Entering the numbers is a little awkward.  The numbers do not highlight until you enter one correctly....so if you put in a one then you can see the ones highlighted.  If you then enter a two and go back to the ones they are not highlighted anymore.  I also did not like the animations of the numbers spinning.  It was wasted time for me.<br /><br />I feel that other sudoku apps are more user friendly.
0316776963|2.0|I can't believe how everyone is raving about this book. I bought it based on it's good reviews - I was looking for something light and humorous to read, but ended up extremely disappointed. I never made it past chapter 3 - and I rarely stop reading any book once I've started. While Sedaris may be considered somewhat witty (I suppose), I found his writing to be, well, boring and less than engaging. I've read plenty of works by authors who actually made me laugh (Rita Mae Brown's &#34;Six of One&#34; comes to mind - now THAT'S a great read) - but Sedaris isn't one of them.<br /><br />It makes me wonder exactly why this author is so highly rated. Any ideas?
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|This is a typical Bruce Willis Die Hard movie with a little bit of a family touch.  Kept our interest but we like this sort of thing.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|How disappointing. So bad I couldn't finish watching. The makers of this film have done a great disservice to the original characters.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|There were some interesting special effects if you like fantasy movies.  A little slow but once it got going it was mildly entertaining.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|Seriously - if you're going to make a musical, doesn't it make sense to hire actors who can actually sing? The one exception to the overall dismal and lackluster singing performances is Anne Hathaway. Too bad her character leaves the scene so soon. It was an absolute CHORE sitting through this film - and I loved the musical.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Love the new twist of Sherlock with modern gadgets... very funny! Makes you think about other classic characters and what they would be like in the 2000's
B0040HO01Y|5.0|absolutely fun.<br />great characters.... you will fall in love with everyone of them within the first minutes of the first episode.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I discovered James Rollins two years ago. Quickly read all his novels after the first. I'm a sucker for a good adventure combined with history and Rollins does not disappoint. Love the development of the characters though the Sigma Force novels.
B008JFUN6E|1.0|Matt Damon looked really old in this film.  Reminded me of Arnold Schwarzenegger<br />in his last movie \\"Last Stand\\".  The character he played did not come off as<br />a person \\"down on their luck\\" ... more of being someone who has made bad decisions<br />all their life and had not learned anything from the consequences of their bad decisions.<br />No charisma.  A real bummer.<br /><br />OK, the slow motion explosion shots were really good and kept me in my seat for 2/3's of the<br />movie.  Damon's poor acting chased me out before the end.  Damon today no longer has the charisma of Bourne<br />of yesterday.  Nether does Schwarzenegger.  Amazingly, Sly Stallone still does ... in spades!
145210655X|5.0|I found this little gem and decided to buy it. I was not disappointed! I knew Luke was a whiner, but wait until you read this book! LOL Very funny! Poor Vader has his work cut out for him. Then again, I later purchased \\"Vader's Little Princess\\" about Leia...I think Vader is glad he has Luke for a son! LOL I recommend both of these books if you want a good laugh.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|LOVED this book.  John Green makes you love the characters right from the start.  They're smart and a little snarky sometimes.  They have interesting and real relationships and you just fall in love with each one of them.  Even the side characters.  The story is great too!  It made me laugh out loud, cry, and yearn to know more about their lives.  READ IT :)
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Awesome. If you liked Manners, download Gossamer. It isn't one of those, &#34;what the hell happened to this group?&#34; second albums. It is just a continuation of awesome. Of course the sound is a little different than what they put out on Manners but no quality was sacrificed in the creation of this album.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Acting spectacular and fashions marvelous.  I always enjoy seeing this movie over and over!  Ending really great and a good lesson for many!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Reviewing this is really a waste of my time, I mean do you need somebody to tell you how awesome this series is, especially the original 3 episodes? I mean, seriously. Star Wars wouldn't have such a following for decades if it sucked a big one. If you don't love Star Wars, you aren't American. Actually, scratch that, you might as well be dead. That's the only justification I can come up with for somebody not having the mental process to actually enjoy movies that should come with the disclaimer WARNING: YOU ARE ABOUT TO F***ING LOVE THIS MOVIE!! Why would you consider buying this and be like, wait, are the reviews good? Well no duh they are good, IT IS STAR WARS!

B00DF0POXA|5.0|With every album realease, Kanye is improving. Yes, the original albums are still good but they keep getting better. Yeezus is no different, just another great album by Kanye. The infusion of electronics throughout the music gives you something different from every other rapper putting music out currently. Definitely an album that gets you pumped up and just in a good mood.

B00AYB1TP0|3.0|My 2 year old loves this app. We play it together and he has learned a lot. Some of the things in the game are not really appropriate. We haven't been through every level but when you build the bear for b his head spins all the way around like he is possessed. One of the pictures for u is a woman in underwear. Not appropriate. A little common sense would go a long way. I'm hoping for an update that addresses these things. If it wasn't for these issues I would have given five stars.

B008AVXGA2|5.0|Firebird by Julia-Gousseva is an admirable undertaking, striving to update one of the most fascinating fairytales in literature, and make it accessible to young readers. Framed in the here and now, this is a journey of discovery, starting with two kids, Alex and Katie, coming to spend the summer with their weird relative, aunt Karina.<br /><br />In her house, a door engraved with foxes and bears leads into a musty library, where Katie discovers an old thick book, a book of Russian fairytale. It is here the kids learn about the Firebird. It is a creature of marvel, traditionally described as having majestic plumage that glows ever so brightly. Its feathers are magical, they can heal pain--but they lose their power if captured by force. Here is a great lesson to be learned.<br /><br />Alex, skeptical of the powers of magic, lays his hand on the canvas of a painting, and his hand goes through, which is when he finds himself in the middle of the meadow, looking back at his sister who remains on the other side, in the realm of reality. It is then that he understands that the painting is a portal into a world of adventure.<br /><br />The kids go on a quest, to bring the magical feather to heal Aunt Karina's pain. But first, she warns them of two things: the feather must be given freely by the Firebird, and they must refrain from talking to old ladies, especially the Baba Yaga, the witch who eats children. Will the follow these instructions? Will the survive the journey, and bring back the magical feather?<br /><br />In reading this book, my only reservation is this: when writing flashbacks from a moment in the past to time before that, a writer should make use of the 'past perfect' tense, which help make the distinction between time periods. Overall, having heard many Russian stories in my childhood, I find Firebird enchanting.<br /><br />Five stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You fall in love with the characters!! Anastasia grows in her character as does Christian. You root for them to just be honest about their feelings. A good read. Can't wait for the movie... this is my second time reading it & I LOVE it more than the first time reading it

1442421037|5.0|Reading over the reviews, I was surprised that people don't appreciate the quality of Cassandra's writing. I honestly don't care if a story is derived from other books. If the writing draws me in, and compels me, that is the most important thing. When a story is original, but not well written, it doesn't hold my interest. I find most contemporary authors lacking in the art of writing, while I feel that Cassandra takes great care to craft each sentence well. In some of her books, I can tell when she has rushed through a chapter, perhaps to meet a deadline.<br /><br />Because I enjoy her prose, I can read her books over and over without getting bored. I can enjoy the moment, even though I know what is coming next.<br /><br />I am currently attempting to write my first novel, and I find myself wishing I could write like Cassandra.<br /><br />I recommend City of Bones, and the rest of the Mortal Instruments saga, as well as the Prequel series: The Infernal Devices.
B004M5HUKM|2.0|This is the first Rough Guide that I have ever bought, having usually used the Lonely Planet series.  I found the book to be well researched and useful, however there is a big 'but'.  The maps in the Kindle edition are close to illegible - I don't know if it is my device (Android Tablet) or the content itself, but this is a massive drawback.  One of the main reasons to buy a guide is to find you way around - so a big failure there!
B00125WAWS|5.0|Believe in God and believe in yourself.  Another fascinating and hidden page in African-American History.  Denzel Washington (and Oprah Winfrey) brings to life the true story about young Black college students overcoming the societal ills of racism to become the first Black debate team to win the honors against the most exclusive elite Ivy League school, Harvard.  It is EXTREMELY important for Black students to stay in school and NEVER give up on their dreams of becoming a leader of tomorrow.

0316017930|5.0|Early on as Gladwell debunks the idea that all success can be explained by \\"rugged individual talent and hard work\\" - I was uncomfortable.  Seeing some of the factors behind the success of admired figures like Bill Joy and Steve Jobs seemed to tarnish a hero.<br /><br />But in the end I was inspired by how over and over 10,000 hours of deliberate practice was what it took to achieve elite performance, how cultural foundations both underlay success and failure - and could be improved, and much more.<br /><br />I was almost brought to tears by the beauty of the story of how these ideas manifested in the lives of his mother, grandmother and back to the original slave bought to be a mistress.  Wonderful stuff.

0380730405|3.0|You have to go into this book acknowledging that it is a classic. The descriptions are wonderful to paint a beautiful picture yet there is enough mystery to allow you tote your imagination run with it. At first when I began I found it very slow however about 2/3 into the book you find out just why it's a classic and a must read.<br /><br />It takes place during the time when cars needed to be cranked to start.  I can understand why it's a classic.  The descriptions are all quite detailed.  The main plot of the book is about Rebecca, the deceased ex-wife of Maxim DeWinter. The book is written from the point of view of who Maxim meets as a companion to elderly nosy woman in Monte Carlo.  I don't actually believe you ever hear what her name is, only Mrs. De Winter once she and Maxim are wed.  The biggest personality trait that I can see in her is her extreme self loathing at certain points in the book.  It was quite bothersome to me.  She and Maxim meet in Monte Carlo and become sort of companions themselves, very comfortable with each others' company.  We learn that his wife has just recently passed away and he is on holiday following her untimely death.  We know he is a good bit older than his new wife but ages are never really discussed.  Guessing, I would say she's in her late teens or early 20's in the beginning of the book.  Maxim owns somewhat of a famous estate known as Manderley in England.  It is known for its lavish parties/balls and gardens.  After they are married and have gone on honeymoon, they return to Manderley.  She feels as an intruder there, and even the servants make her feel less than welcome and more like an outsider.  The book depicts their lives together once they are married.

For anyone who hasn't read the series... Definitely start with the selection first xx happy reading!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This game is amazingly fun and addictive if you like puzzle games (like tetris or bejeweled or jewel legends), this is sorta like Tetris in that you make full rows of blocks to clear them but it's not just a tetris knock-off, it's a whole new experience.  You can move any block left and right until it hits something else and then when you let go, blocks fall from the top of the screen, and so on until you aren't getting enough rows cleared and run out of room with bricks all the way to the top.

Rick Stein has a TV program in the UK which portrays south India splendidly, especially the cuisine and his interactions with the cooks and chefs.

0060989157|5.0|I liked Motley Crue back in the early 90s and late 80's. Read the book just for fun and enjoyed it more than I expected.  I am shocked any of those guys are still alive with all the drugs and crazy stuff they did.  I also was naive not knowing all the nasty things girls will do degrading themselves to be with a musician.  Rock stars are still just normal men, not worth humiliating yourself over ladies.  LOL
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a refreshing reminder not to worry too much about being original, because nobody else is. It's short, but I don't mind. I prefer a short book full of information than a book that drones on and on, repeating itself. Highly recommended.

0765325950|5.0|The end of the Wheel Of Time finally came and it met all my expectations! I am only sad that such a powerful series, like all good things, had to come to an end.
0307476464|4.0|This was a book I heard a lot of positive things about, that stared at me from the shelves of bookstores, and was on my to-do list until I finally gave in. It is an excellent tale of parallel worlds, but does repeat itself to the point of annoyance in terms of referencing Orwell's 1984. As this was my first Murakami, I assumed it was a translation error and kept going. The ending was fantastic and tied up all plot lines so beautifully that I re-read the last chapters for the sheer joy of experiencing them again.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|The story started out with an air of mystery and excitement that echoed the rêveurs' experiences in the circus. Toward the end, the plot faltered and felt rushed. The chapters that were dedicated solely to the experience of the circus were written in such a festive manner that they could have made a great book on its own. All in all, a fun read.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|Scarface ~ The Ultimate Guide does what the name suggests, it gives the reader the ultimate guide to this 1983 movie thriller.

B008Y73XTQ|5.0|If you love vintage subs this is as good as it gets ! Very well written and directed and the acting is superb !
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I wish I knew where exactly to begin. Maybe with the ridiculous plot. But even ridiculous plots can be somewhat entertaining if sold, written and acted credibly. My biggest question lies with Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, who basically are world-class A+ legendary actors-- who get to do whatever they want. They don't even have to go in and audition-- they design their careers. So, Mr. Morgan and Mr. Cruise, you're pitched this script and you're sitting there in your living room reading it, What was it that spoke to you and said \\"this is a story that needs to be told\\"?<br />\\"This is a beautiful script and will be a box office smash!\\" This film has more holes than my target paper after I've gone to the rifle range. And I'm not Being dramatic.<br /><br />In short we finally discovered why A-list stars are flocking to television.<br /><br />On a high note I spent five dollars to find that out. #Sarcasm
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|\\"Good\\" - the special effects, including their skybase and the jetcopter, were visually stunning (which is expected from Hollywood).<br /><br />\\"Bad\\" - the props and the thin plot. Tom Cruise' uniform and his rifle are cheap and phony to the point of distraction. The uniform Tom Cruise wears is right out of The Day the Earth Stood Still.... the 1950's version, and the rifle is obviously light plastic as he throws it around like a wiffle ball bat.<br /><br />By design, the setting was one of isolation and loneliness, unfortunately this was combined with a thin, uninspired plot which exacerbated the movie's weaknesses. The visuals were striking, but once I adjusted to this I was looking for more substance and plot, which were only partially delivered. Under the circumstances, a deeper, more intriguing plot was necessary.<br /><br />The pace picked up somewhat near the end, with some nice twists, but even these were recognizable themes that leave you with the sense of \\"I've seen this stuff before\\". This movie needed more Morgan Freeman and little less Tom Cruise.<br /><br />It is not a bad movie. I enjoyed it...somewhat, but it never grabbed me. I was initially amazed by the visuals, but as this wore off, I was left with mild indifference to the simple storyline. I've been on a multi-year rant about Hollywood blockbusters that spend countless millions on special effects and big name actors, but apparently spend very little on writing, and in my opinion this is another example of my gripe. This blockbuster movie that could have and should have been much better with relatively little effort.
B00AV68GOA|5.0|I bought the first season DVD, out of curiosity, because I have enjoyed British movie series in the past (Flambards is another great series), and I was NOT disappointed. I even got my non- relational, crime/drama- loving husband hooked on Downton Abbey too! I think he likes it for the historical aspect, but I  don't care, at least it's something we can enjoy together.<br />We streamed the second and third seasons from Amazon, and are eagerly awaiting the fourth season....we hear it is supposed to be the best one.<br />The characters are all so likable and believable, you forget they are just actors- they begin to feel like your own family.<br />I highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great set-up. Really explores the nitty gritty of marriage in an interesting way. He in first person, she thru diary entries. Had me hanging...waiting for the big ending, twisty and turny, and then....nothing.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|If your into sci-fi but cant handle the cheesy-ness of most sci-fi television shows, check this one out. Its the only Stargate Ive ever truly gotten into, such a waste of a great cast and story to be canceled after season 2. I own the dvds and have watched them several times.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|In the nine years since I started gaming nothing has ever stood out to me more than these two. Ever since first hearing about them and the endless amounts of praise they received I have always considered them some sort of forbidden fruit. I almost knew I would not regret playing the, and yet some part of me always prevented me from giving them a chance. I think it was intimidation. I was afraid that I would finally play through the two of them and be disappointed with the outcome, or have too much trouble getting through them, as I often have with more \\"unique\\" games and simply giving up. Well, two weeks ago my girlfriend found out about this collection, and knowing me to be a big gamer, decided to get them for me as a gift.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that I will never look at video games the same way again.<br /><br />I will not go into detail. There are hundreds of other reviewers who can do that for you at length, but I will say that these two games are utterly unlike anything you have ever, and perhaps will ever, play. There is nothing to compare them to. They are absolutely incredible in what they accomplish in such a short amount of time, and the emotions they stir are something that all artists strive for and yet so few achieve, and their effect is something simply impossible in any other medium.<br /><br />Are they perfect? No. There are issues with them from time to time: Performance hiccups, clunky controls, and often poor camera direction. Compared with the merits of them though, these are very easily overlooked problems.<br /><br />As a gamer, you owe it to yourself to play these.<br /><br />If you have ever needed proof that video games can be art, here it is.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Purchased the e-book version to read on my computer.  Reading was easy and this book is great. I read it after watching the movie (which I thought was amazing).  Collins is brilliant.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book had been recommended to me for years. I was so happy to finally read it! It was a fantastic journey and a major page turner, I finished it in less than a day. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a bit of fancy!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Extremely addictive timekiller! I waste, I don't know how many hours of time playing this game. Suddenly the clock is three hours ahead.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I swear, even when the trailer came out I had chills. I saw the original version and it was alright considering the graphics were shit and it's just.. an old movie. I didn't expect much. But the remake literally had me in tears in the theater! If you like scary, LOOK NO FURTHER! Scariest movie ever!
0743435753|5.0|I do not want to say too much. But it is amazing how Mr. Weber keeps track of all the events in his books and brings characters back, particularly the villains, at key moments. This book is a grand example. It stands on its own but also fits very neatly into the entire arc of stories.<br />Do not hesitate to add it to your library.<br />I am a seminal Heinlein fan. Scalzi exploded into my universe two years ago and I have most of this books. They are mind blowing. Weber is a tad different. I've had Down Below Station for over 20 years. A couple months back, wanting to know more about Honor, I went on an orgy and am now missing but two or three books from the series, which means I have bought a whole helluva lot of books. None disappoints. Flag in Exile is one of the top two or three. You cannot go wrong.

B000FA5SMK|5.0|I enjoyed Plum Island very much. It took place in an area I was familiar.<br /><br />The plot was extremely interesting as well as educational. I truly enjoy DeMille's style and subject area.
B000002U88|4.0|Most people look at Live Bullet/Night Moves era Seger as his \\"peak.\\" Me, I believe this is truly the magnum opus. It's a shame Drew Abbott left the SBB before the album could be finished as I love his guitar work. But this is Seger's songwriting at it's absolute best. Def my favorite out of them all. It's packed with an energy blended with a loneliness that's not as upfront in the albums that followed (although there are some exceptions). Like A Rock was dark, but The Distance had a power and a force to it. It starts off almost as a loose concept album about relationships...I think I read somewhere that's what Seger had in mind. \\"Even Now\\" reminisces on an old flame that apparently left Seger feeling \\"victimized\\" as he says in the lyrics \\"Out in the distance, always within reach, there's a crossroad where all the victims meet.\\"  I always considered this the title track of the album for those lines...the true heart of the album. For those of you listening on vinyl or cassette (you're lucky if you are...I'll tell you why in a moment) you might notice that Side One ends with some of the loneliest and most desperate Seger songs in his catalog. \\"Shame on the Moon\\" although written by Rodney Crowell is instantly a classic the moment you hear it. \\"Love's The Last To Know\\" is a true cliffhanger. Probably one of the most emotional relationship ballads of Seger's career (second only to the massive tie of ballads such as \\"Turn The Page\\" \\"We've Got Tonight\\" \\"The Famous Final Scene\\" \\"20 Years From Now\\" \\"Like A Rock\\" \\"Against the Wind\\" etc....yeah I could go on and on).<br /><br />Side Two starts off a little more hopeful so to speak. \\"Roll Me Away\\" is American heartland rock freedom in a nutshell. It became a staple for motorcycle trip soundtracks for decades. \\"House Behind A House\\" gets us back into that lonely wailing quality that this album offers, but this time backed with a fast-paced rock and roll force. \\"Comin' Home\\" is a sweet ballad about someone going away...blowing it...and finally coming back home. \\"Little Victories\\" could not have ended this album better. Lyrics that stand out in your head for years after your first listen with a steady power. Heavy drums and loud squealing guitars dominate the composition. There's some pretty fun stuff on here too like \\"Makin' Thunderbirds\\" which serves as an ode to the Detroit motor industry. \\"Boomtown Blues\\" is also a little close to home (in Seger's case anyway) \\"You can't miss that freezing rain, you'd have to be insane, to head back north and go through all that again.\\"<br /><br />Now with opinions like that you're probably wondering why I didn't give it 5 stars. Especially since it's my #1 favorite Seger album. Well I'll tell you right now...there is absolutely nothing wrong with this album. I would give it a million stars if I could. It's Seger at his best in my opinion. The reason I failed to give this CD a 5 star rating is the CD itself. It's not been remastered since it's original CD pressing. Despite what AmazonMP3 says...this is NOT I repeat NOT a \\"2011 remastered album.\\" In recent years Seger has remastered most of his later catalog. This album, along with Beautiful Loser and Like A Rock, are still widely available in the music market...but with the same quiet and weak sound quality they had in the mid 1980s when they were first pressed on CD. Seger really needs to take into consideration that a lot of people would buy or rebuy this album a lot quicker if it had a more modern pressing. Live Bullet has been remastered TWICE since this album was released. Night Moves in 99, Stranger in 01, Wind in 02 and even ol' Smokin' O.P.'s had a second chance to shine back in 05. Nine Tonight was reissued back in 2011, which was the most recent remaster in his catalog and just so happens to be the album ahead of this one...so maybe that's a sign that The Distance is next in line? I sure hope so, because it sucks to have to turn your stereo all the way up just to receive a fraction of the dynamic power that the original cassette tape and vinyl had. Needless to say I've tracked down a few copies of each to hold me over until it finally sees the light of day on CD again. Same with Like A Rock, and all the albums prior to Beautiful Loser. Ahhh Seger, we love your music man. Your fans are thirsty over here for some reissues.<br /><br />Long story short, get this album...but skip this format. Go back and track down the vinyl or cassette tape like I did. Or I can save you a place in line for the reissue...it's your call.
0446572985|4.0|This is typical Baldacci. The writing is not awesome, and there are some elements in the plot that are over the top, but overall this author delivers a fun and engaging novel that keeps us reading avidly. When I started reading the book, I immediately had a feeling of deja vu. Will Robbie is an assassin that works for the government and when a mission has him question the orders he has received, he ends up being the one on the run. This is when he crosses paths with Julie, a teenage girl whose parents have just been murdered and is also being chased by killers. When the unlikely duo gets together, it did feel very similar to Leon The Professional and I was starting to fear the worst. Luckily, the author does enough to make this story different and the similarities soon end.<br /><br />The novel has a little bit of everything: espionage, action, thrills, suspense, mystery and romance. Some elements are better delivered than others. For example, Baldacci is great at conveying action scenes, but when he starts to craft sections of the plot that have to do with clever plans, he has a tendency to go completely over the top and make the story unbelievable. This happens here with the explanation regarding some of the connections among the characters. The good news is that this is not the central part of the story, so I could get past that.<br /><br />As long as you know what you are getting, which is fast-paced entertainment with some OK writing, this is a very good book to try. I will keep up with this series hoping the quality stays there or maybe even increases.
B00DM0YE9S|4.0|This movie started out a bit slow and was also a bit confusing.  After the first 30 minutes I started to understand the plot and the movie became more and more interesting.  The ending was very good and worth the wait.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I was excited to download this game, since Sudoku is a favorite hobby of mine. The app does not ask for any unneeded permissions, so it passes the security check. As for the gameplay and degree of polish in this app, look below for positives and negatives.<br /><br />Gameplay: The note taking features are well done: You can mark spaces you are not sure of (placing several possible numbers in the spot), so you can eventually place the correct number in that space. Also, when a number cannot be used anymore (you have placed all possible selections of that number) it disappears from the number selections which is intuitive. The gameplay is fun, and I like the summer theme, although I didn't know a life saver represented summer time? Nonetheless, the sudoku is addictive and entertaining, and great for pick up and play<br /><br />Graphics: The boards do not very in theme, and always have a blue checkered background. The graphics are crisp though, and defined, unlike a lot of FAOTD apps I download. The numbers are easy to read, and the game board really looks good.<br /><br />Polish: The game really does feel like the developer (24/7 games...never heard of them before) put some time into the app. When playing, you have options to pause the game, change the sound settings, edit and make notes on the game board, so the options are there. One thing I don't like is the menu of the game is REALLY barren, only allowing you to select from different difficulty settings, and not including any music until you enter a game.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Overall: I love sudoku, and this game didn't disappoint. It may not be a big budget attempt at the game from a big developer, but it does the job for a nice and refreshing Free App of the Day.<br /><br />Positives: Quick, entertaining gameplay; Crisp graphics; The notes feature works well in-game<br /><br />Negatives: Menu is laughable; Would like somewhat of a soundtrack while I play;is laughable; Would like somewhat of a soundtrack while I play;
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love Eva and Gideon i thought this was gonna be the last book but i was left with so many questions and knew it couldn't be the end.

B004HWYTP4|3.0|I would definitely recommend this film for pure entertainment, but the plot was pretty predictable and some of the scenes were just way too far-fetched. But, you can beet Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game is really fun, and has great graphics. I haven't ever played a game quite like it, so the uniqueness of the game gives it charm. In addition, it is rather long which I like.
0316228583|1.0|I have not much to say on J.K. Rowling first novel for adult readership. Rarely do I give up on a novel \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" made the list. After labouring through 250 pages I simply couldn't waste more precious reading time on a very boring story concerning a parish council election in a small West Country town. This story is an unadventurous study of provincial life with some superficial excitements. A large cast of young characters taking drugs, swearing and having sex weaves through a multiple and interlocking plots that are flat-lined by predictability. I wasn't able from the start to immerse myself in the people I found them very frustrating and a real farce. I gave up....that is all I can say.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I love to play tetris, and this game is similiar, except more face paced and harder! The object of the game is to eliminate lines (just like tetris) but the twist is you can manipulate blocks left and right. It is a lot of fun!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Countries around the world today train their children to be Olympians, intellectuals,etc.  at all costs  therefore the main concept of this book shouldn't that shocking but it is.  I loved the twists throughout the whole plot and I never got bored. Ender is now my hero. Loved it!
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love Sci-fi type of movies, this show grabbed my attention from the begging. its a great watch. I will definitely recommend watching this show.
B004DM1ZQY|1.0|There is nothing remotely fair about this game! I am a champion player, who has won many tournaments, this game cheats. Uncover- magically you're hit. Bare off for the win- you roll little numbers while the game rolls double after double. You win the opening move 1 out of 20+ times. Beat me fair &amp; square but don't cheat me. I do not recommend this game!

B00371QQ0M|3.0|Given the capacity and capabilities of Blu-ray, this highly-anticipated release doesn't come close to fulfilling its potential.  While it carries over all the bonus features of the double-sided Steelbook DVD of the film, it's missing the most obvious piece from the Steelbook release:  The extended edition.  Much as I love David Lynch's theatrical cut, many fans find there's also a lot to be said for the longer version put together later.  The very nature of the Blu-ray format allows for so much more than what we actually get here:  The theatrical release (previously released as a single-sided DVD), and the featurettes of the double-sided DVD that contained both versions of the film.  Curiously, the production notes found on both DVD releases are gone, as is the theatrical trailer (which only appeared on the original DVD release of the theatrical cut).  The film and its fans deserve better.
B004KPLVYA|5.0|This was a heart warming movie. Great for the family! A movie you can watch for many years to come.
B001EBWIRW|5.0|I watched it with my grand daughter and this is what she has to say \\"THIS MOVIE WAS FUNNY, I REALLY ENJOYED WATCHING IT WITH MY SUGAR MAMA. WE LAUGHED SO HARD.\\"  I highly rrecommend this movie.
B00DM0YE9S|3.0|Weak, unsurprising finish, been done too many times. Acting very good but screenwriter should have changed the ending; too repetitious .

B009NY43NY|5.0|I put of enjoying this book for a while just because it is the end of Sookie Stackhouse in book form. I had heard a lot of people did not like the book, but I enjoyed it completely. I thought Charlaine Harris wrapped up the story nicely and the end result was in line with the character we have come to know over the years in reading the books and short stories. Ultimately I am glad I waited to read this because I loved every minute of it.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|everyone said get this app its so worth four dollars this app is horrible save you money on survivlecraft yuk I'm deleting it and i only have the demo
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I thought this was an excellent continuation to the beautiful creatures book. I was a bit late coming to the party but think this series is completely appropriate for young adults (and adults who like to read YA). The story is wonderful, the writing excellent and the characters are relatable. I am thoroughly enjoying this series.
B00CP4RZIO|5.0|I love Chimaira and am happy that they stayed true to their music and selves! It's heavy, great-paced, angry and invigorating, which is how I love my Chimaira!
B0011UF792|5.0|One of my all time favorite kevin smith films. Not being catholic, but raised by a catholic mother, the story resonated and was a fun exploration into religion. This film also has some great lines and moments and I recommend it to anyone (with the caveat that they may be offended if they have strong Christian beliefs)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first book I love this one 2 gonna love book 3 these books are way better than Twilight! (:
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This picture editing app is amazing. I love this app because you can take a picture you already have and make it into something new, or start from scratch. And you can draw, crop, change the lighting, and more!!! I love love love it!!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennent and Catherine Tate are a wonderful combination.  They have the same eccentricities.  The plots were very well written, and the guest actors were great.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|This is my first interface and it gets the job done. It transports whatever instrument your recording straight into your computer. No buzzing noises, no background noises. Just your guitar, keyboard, mic, what have you. This thing works great.<br /><br />It wasn't hard at all to set it up. All I did was plug it into my computer and downloaded a thing or two and bam, its ready to use.<br /><br />Remember, I'm a beginner recording artist. So if you're skeptical to buy this cause you think it is complicated. It's not. It's very self explanatory and easy to use. Not to mention this thing looks nice too:)<br /><br />If you are a solo artist, then this is defenitly for you. Usually when I'm recording stuff, its only one thing at a time and then I layer it from there. So I don't really need more than 2 inputs. If you are a drummer or in a 5 man band. It'll still do its job well.. It would just take more time!... Alot more! Haha.<br /><br />Overall. I give this a 9.8 out of 10. It's perfect for me!:)
B005J2UM9S|5.0|I happen to be a huge fan of the \\"reality\\" paranormal shows on tv like paranormal state and paranormal witness, ect. I really liked how this movie approached the topic in this style. You can clearly see who certain characters were modeled after, especially lance ;). I tend to be a tough critic when it comes to movies but I really enjoyed this one. The acting is believable, although a parody of sorts of the tv personalities. The filming was not as choppy as I have noticed with some of the same movies done in this style and it didn't give me a headache like they do. I liked the progression of nothing happening to the non stop suspense during the last half of the movie. I would watch it again, and recommend it to others who like a good paranormal flick.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is really fun and entertaing keeps me occupied. :) You can never get bored from this game cause its always different.:D
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Love it tells you how much time you have left so that you can figure out when you can put your kindle to charge

B0020PJJHS|5.0|Best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films!  Great femme fatale in Famke Janssen.  Marks the first time a &#34;00&#34; went rogue on film - Sean Bean as 006.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|was way more interesting of a story line and the characters lives were more interesting. Eva was definitely more challenging as a female character compared to 50 Shades&#34; Ana
0753541637|5.0|I heard this book from a co-worker, she highly recommanded it. She also recommanded leanin.org. The book and the website are amazing. Wish I had read it earlier!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think this is an excellent series by PBS. Love the period costumes and settings and all the actors!! Can't wait till Season 4
B004MPJZ1O|5.0|It is easy to revile this movie. Most do. And for good reason. The rape scene alone will make you feel like vomiting. I gave it five stars, however, because the movie is a benchmark critique by Hollywood concerning male violence against females. Perhaps the acting and directing are not the best, but the social statement is devastating. I wish some director or writer would come up with a movie that depicts the atrocities females commit against males. Perhaps that movie could be titled, \\"I Spit on Your Grave, Too.\\"
B00821PCJS|4.0|Not bad. Decent acting. Decent premise. It is worth a look. Try Continuum too. Under the Dome is great too.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Its awesome, fun and addictive!!!!  It is as fun as Tetris, and very sweating. Love this, would definitely recommend it.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|The trial is a great preview of the game and the  purchase is totally worth it. Don't go buying everything right off the bat though. Everything will unlock as you play through the campaign. Plus, don't forget to unlock the promotional items and you get a free physical booster pack. So awesome!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I am hooked from the time i started with Season 1. Each season keeps getting better. Can't wait to move on to the next season.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Typical chick flick enjoyed the actors  Kate Hudson is great as always  The story line was predictable but what romantic comedy isn't
B001EBYM8A|5.0|I think this is a good movie. It is the prequel to US Marshals and is a good showcase of both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones work.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Although I've seen this movie before, I had to watch it again.  It's a great love story that people can relate to, especially if they have loved ones dealing with Alzheimer's disease.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|What a great story to show the seriousness racism in the U S A.  The movie was both profound and thought provoking
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this calculator. It's basic, but for simple calculations, it gets the job done. If you need to calculate sophisticated, multi-step functions, you should choose a different app or format (I.e. graphing calculator).
B008JFUO36|5.0|Oblivion is an extreamly complex and excellant sci-fi movie. tom cruse plays a rear guard soldier left back on earth to protect water vaporizers for mankind which have outlanded to titan. or did they?
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This was a fun app, but I finished the whole thing in 30 minutes. I am looking forward to future updates with more levels. You have to think outside of the box fir some of the answers. I will be downloading this for my son (8). This is a very good problem-solving/brain exercise for him.
0064471837|5.0|Browsing the library's YA section, my mom found a copy of Sabriel and suggested I check it out to read. Slightly apprehensive of the book's size, I was reluctant to choose such a novel because I had recently learned how to read. However, I am glad that I did!<br /><br />Nix swept me on this wondrous, magical adventure with a fierce and strong woman. With each page we discovered more about her and her world. His story shaped how I viewed fantasy literature and what it could be. It's been many years since I first read the book, but the novel is still fresh in my mind; when I think of 'Sabriel', I can mentally conjure up certain scenes from the book. It still influences my literary choices - I look for the book that has a strong voice, plot and character. And when I write, I try to create my own rich world with unique twists, turns, and mixture of dark and light because Sabriel also influence how and what I write.<br /><br />However, nothing compares to this books. There will never be a novel quite like this one. I would recommend this book to anyone (young or old) with likes adventure and fantasy stories. In fact, I've given 'Sabriel' as a gift to many people! Nix really created a wondrous story. Thank you, Mr. Nix - if you are reading this. Thank you for a wonderful piece of literature.
B00821OX98|5.0|From the moment you begin to watch this season, you are catapulted into a fight for survival that twists and turns, frightens and compels, you must continue to watch!
1455523550|5.0|I got this book at Walmart. It was in the marked down section. I have seen The Notebook and thought I would give the author a chance with writing. I picked up the book because I recently started working a graveyard shift which has little work to offer at times. I am not normally a romance novel reader. I read this book over the course of 3 nights, a total of 6 hours. It starts off slow and once you get into the \\"nitty-gritty you won't be able to put it down. As I finished the last chapter, I actually got goosebumps all over my body (You will know what part I am talking about!) Absolutely recommend for the casual romance reader, currently looking for other Nicholas Sparks books!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good,funny,sexy,quick read I think I approve this author.<br />Could be a good book for the younger set but only with parental consent.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|Horrible textures, non existent models, fighting is atrocious, but even with all of that, it's fun to me. It's really, really, REALLY, fun. It's highly flawed but don't let that get to you. Play it through, an enjoy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Some people might not like it at first but once they have built there world they love it u have to buy this game worth every penny
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It was OK. This guy can definitely play the part if they decide to do more but the story was a little weak and I HATE THE MANDATORY CHASE SCENES!!!
B00DURILJ2|4.0|Fantastic. The acting was brilliant. The story was simple yet effective. And it's one film that I'll probably watch more than once.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Everyone already knows how awesome this movie is! Nothing left to say! Claire Danes is brilliant and spot on as Temple Grandin
0061733199|5.0|I've taught survival skills to everyday people for over 20 years and this is a revision of an already awesome book. It should be in every back pack.
085720873X|2.0|Vince Flynn is an outstanding writer and I'm sorry he passed, but this book had way too much profanity in it for my taste.
B00E1942VO|3.0|it is okay but no where near where they used to be.I hope this isnt a pattern of a spiral down
0143120255|4.0|Liked it but didn't expect the small size. Definitely a very good option for coffee table book or any New York's stuff collection.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|The premise could be somewhat alarming as it serves as an allegory that parallels the sex industry, in which people pay big bucks to buy people. In this case, people pay big bucks to do whatever they want to people before they kill them.<br /><br />Right. Torture people, just like the debasing, humiliating experience of being raped, and then killing them, the same way a person's spirit is killed by being passed from one dirtbag to the next.<br /><br />This movie may have been more than it actually was had the team not been obsessed with making you gag more and more with each passing scene and instead focused on the story it seems to have been trying to tell.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This new update Is AWESOME! I love Minecraft and now that you can swim, spawn pigs,cows, and chickens, talk, it's almost as fun as the PC version! :) You won't regret buying this, BECAUSE IT'S AMAZING!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Let's start with how unnecessary this book was in the series. Suzanne Collins started by writing a novel about a girl who participates in a battle to the death with other kids in order to spare her younger sister from the carnage. This second novel in the series is almost certainly a repeat of the previous novel, with the exception that there is now a grudge between her and the government of Panem due to her actions of defiance at the end of the first novel, which ended with the strong, iron-fisted image of the government beginning to show signs of fatigue and galling. While it was fun seeing yet another incarnation of the dreaded Arena, it became repetitive and felt as though it were a fanfic of the first novel.<br /><br />We have some more character development, more secrets are revealed, and it becomes a personal jousting match between Katniss and the President.<br /><br />Very little by way of plot and storyline is revealed despite the enormous novel we have in our hands this time around. Lots of character development, yes, but not much action in overall story progress. This is perhaps where the first person limited perspective is weak. The only reason I give this novel a 4/5 is because in the background brews an all-out revolution, which is my type of novel. The 4 is the expectation growing in me as I envision Katniss enduring one challenge after another. What must be going on outside of the Arena? Outside of the places Katniss has thus far explored? What about those Mockingjay symbols dotting certain characters?<br /><br />In the previous novel, we saw a Prim-analogue die in the Games. How would her people react, watching such a young and innocent soul extinguish on a battlefield upon which she did not belong? Furthermore, why the hell have these people been putting up with this BS for the last three quarters of a century? We know that there was a rebellion before and that's the reason for the institution of the Hunger Games, but human beings are by nature defiant. We do not like being told what to do. And like a cornered fox, human beings tend to lash out and fight to the death when the alternative is a life of perpetual bondage.<br /><br />As far as Katniss's development goes, this novel had me irked close to the end. She goes from the badass she starts off as in the first novel as to this common soldier who has no clue what the hell is going on (more on this in Mockingjay). Granted Collins's goal was to portray the effect of warfare on youngsters, but this is not what makes for a good book. It is the same reason so many videogames out there are so unrealistic. If everything were made fully realistic, everything would be boring and tedious. This is another reason the first person limited perspective is weak; when Katniss is unconscious, we effectively have our books closed. There are no other characters to provide insight, or even exposition, as to what the heck is going on when our main gal is KTFO.<br /><br />This novel is the start of the decline of &#34;The Hunger Games,&#34; leaving me hungry for more, and not in the good way.iant.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|watching it again 3rd time around and understand it a lot better. Highly recommend it to anyone with similar interest
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I went into &#34;Mockingjay&#34; hoping that it would redeem itself from the unnecessary journey that was &#34;Catching Fire.&#34; When we look at all three books as a whole, it becomes clear that the series's storytelling might have been much more effective had author Collins taken a different approach, say third person limited or alternative limited and unlimited. There is so much going on in Mockingjay, sadly the kind of stuff I LOVE, and yet we only get flashes of it thanks to the half-conscious Katniss's limited perspective.<br /><br />It is clear by the end of the first third of the novel that Katniss has pretty full-blown PTSD setting in, which does not make for a strong character, strong lead, or strong perspective. All three a needed in a first-person novel as that character serves as the vehicle of delivery for the storyline and all of the other characters. When Katniss is out cold, or just not in her head at the moment, we are deprived of all the wonder and glory that the world has to offer. There are no fancy speeches by any revolutionary heroes, no menacing arch-villain (save for the creepy President Snow), and no landmark moments like &#34;Saving Private Ryan.&#34; Perhaps it is this realism that Collins was going for. After all, the only noteworthy speech in the entire series, made by Katniss, is cut short in very anticlimactic fashion. Although this technique has its merits, it did not quite tickle my fancy. It was more comical than anything else.<br /><br />Characters die needlessly, perhaps as Collins intended. After all, she wanted to show the meaninglessness of warfare and the deaths that accompany it. Ever watch your buddy get blown up by a roadside bomb? I haven't. Never been to war either. I have seen plenty come back with serious existential issues and PTSD. A childhood friend of mine cannot stop staring out the window looking for potential ambush points because of what he's been through. Such portrayals are perfectly acceptable, but NOT to the perspective character of a first-person limited novel. Such a character does not serve as a reliable or even enjoyable vehicle for the portrayal of a story. This scenario is akin to having your eyes closed through half of the movie.<br /><br />Collins wrote a good series, and, in my opinion, a good ending to what should have been a 2-part series, or perhaps the second book to a potential trilogy with a different ending. This novel, perhaps intentionally, leaves one drained and devoid of purpose. Everything you have fought alongside Katniss for is wiped out and your raison d'etre vanishes in a fireball. This, my friends, is Mockingjay.<br /><br />The subject matter alone is what keep this at a mercy 4/5 for me. Had it been written in third-person unlimited, we would have been given a much better perspective of the scope of the battles and warfare. Instead we are stuck wondering why the heck we're shooting propaganda shorts instead of going out there and fighting the enemy.<br /><br />I have a soft spot for underdog stories, revolutions, and assymetric warfare. Had we been given a better set of eyes, maybe this book and its series would have been much better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game will keep you guessing. It's challenging and fun at the same time. The first time I played out was hooked.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Perhaps one of the most powerful ideas in this book is the idea of defiance, of standing up to those who mean you harm. That is the spirit that Katniss Everdeen embodies. She is the big sister that puts her own life on the line so that her sister, Primrose, does not need to fight in the dreaded Hunger Games.<br /><br />There are many out there who lambaste Collins for seemingly copy-and-pasting &#34;Battle Royale&#34; word for word, but there are enough differences between the two for this book not to be blatant copy, perhaps merely another author's rendition of a similar source work. Of course, the purpose of this review is not to compare two books side-by-side, but to review Suzanne Collins's &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; as a standalone novel.<br /><br />The premise is simple. Every year twelve districts all around the totalitarian country of Panem must send one boy and one girl as &#34;Tributes&#34; into the Hunger Games, a contest between the districts that awards the winning district with fame and glory and lots and lots of resources from the government. What an excellent concept this is, from a political standpoint. It keeps the upper class citizens of Panem, who reside at the capital, happy and entertained, while the bottom of the pyramid, the Districts, fight against each other, making a full-blown rebellion all but impossible. Of course, this year's Games is not like any of the other games. There can be only one victor, but it is Katniss's defiant spirit that causes the greatest upset to the games Panem has ever seen.<br /><br />As a first-person limited novel, much of the history of Collins's world is left to conjecture. Katniss is a strong observer, but not an omniscient one, not by a long shot. She can only provide her own guesses, which we adopt and add to, as to what is happening outside of the Games that she is currently participating in. However, the strength of this perspective lies in giving us, the readers, unlimited access to the deepest recesses of Katniss's mind. We effectively become Katniss Everdeen, the defiant girl who started a spark of revolution throughout the nation.<br /><br />The character development is good. We get to know not only Katniss, but also the characters she comes across. But perhaps it is Haymitch's character that steals the show. His attitude toward life, teetering between sarcastic scorn and PTSD, reflects the attitudes of some soldiers who return from combat. According to Collins, such is actually her source material for the characters and plot, the exploration of combat and its effects on young soldiers. As this is the first novel in the series, we still have yet to see any significant development of Gale and Peeta, both of whom remain rather static throughout the novel. Peeta starts off weak, he ends off weak, getting wounded and hiding in the mud as opposed to Katniss, who becomes a huntress of people.<br /><br />The plot and pacing are good, though it's a little slow for the first third of the book. Collins uses this first part to develop the main backstory of Panem, dedicating the latter half to the actual Games itself. Once we step into the arena, however, it's no holds barred and everything you've ever known just flies out the window.<br /><br />This is by no means a thorough review of the novel. I have only read it once and that was over a year ago, so I'm going on very shallow memory right now. Overall, it is an enjoyable novel, the start of something that could have been, but failed to launch with Mockingjay.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|the special effects in this movie were great as well as the story. This movie while great in some aspects could have been a little longer with the story adding more to it. I would definitely recommend for PG13, if that matters and for adults as it is has that do the right thing always and you will be rewarded for having a good heart.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I liked this book. I think it was a bit too slow, personally. And I got quite confused having so many characters. However, I think the story is very original and a really good one.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|There seemed to be some story lines that hit dead ends, or I missed them.  I'm not sure which.  All in all though, a very good book.  The author's writing puts you right in the scene, and it seems sometimes as if you can touch and taste in the moment.  I loved it all the way through, much as I did, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Summers.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What these guys do for us is amazing. They are what makes America great.  It's just too bad that some in our government don't understand sacrifices these men and others have made.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is very hard.  It isn't very much fun.  It was boring really fast.  The graphics are okay.  The puzzles are confusing.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I liked this book because it was imaginary. Also I learned that Dorothy's shoes were silver in the book and not red like in the movie.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I liked it even though I lost the wars.  It was challenging.  The Graphics were very good.  A little hard for 9 yr old.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's an awesome game. It's similar to subway surfers but I guess because it has a story behind it in which I understand and know, I find more fun. Also, those minions are hilariously despicable.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|The series provides excellent historical fiction.  I wish that I didn't have to  wait for the third book in the trilogy.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I like the writer way and simplicity. The drawing that the writer used kept me engaged with the text . I advice you to read this book if you want to take your self out of your self.
B007JMYWCE|3.0|I liked that the product go to my in a timely manner. I liked that the disc work with out any skipping. The product came as advertised with wear and tare. I didn't like that it came in a single layer of cheap bubble wrap in an envelope. I don't like that the case I received doesn't close.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|If you are looking for a true love story, look no further! This movie has been my favorite for years and it dosent look like anything will top it anytime soon!!
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Great to see movie, but surprise...it required me to update the system software on my Samsung dvd player. For some reason DVD player needed to updated like a PC in order to view the movie... a pain.. and the first time I have ever had to update a dvd player.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. It is a wonderful love story and i was so glad that she made the right choice. A must see video for everyone!
B009NY43NY|4.0|It wouldn't be fair to give the book a bad rating because I am bummed that the series is over.  I did like this one.  I liked them all.  It's sad that there really has to be an end to the series!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Sweet story of a very close-knit music community that in their lives and careers were as competitive as they were collaborative.  Now as they retire, they continue to hone their musical skills and face the challenges of reconciliation.  Another challenge they face is how to keep their beloved retirement community financially viable.  It's a lovely film and all the performances are brilliant.  Nicely told, elegant, delightful.
B0000CJDAA|5.0|I read this book some 35 years ago in high school, and re-read it recently after watching the movie \\"The Way Back\\". This guy went through hell and back. Read the book then watch the film.
6305128952|5.0|I could watch this movie everyday for at least a month and then get it out again in about a month and start all over!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A very good history of an era swathed in myth. Not to say that all of it is myth. But this book casts some good light on it. And it backs away enough to give religion and historical fact room to breathe on their own.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK! I have never cried so hard on a book. You can get so involved with Hazel and Augustus. You understand their relationship. You feel like a part of their relationship. I'm in love. I really hope there's a movie. Lol
0307730700|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Once I started reading it was difficult to put down. This is more than another military book about our elite fighting forces. Sure, it would be difficult to read this book and not feel more patriotic and proud of our \\"warriors\\". Even better is the story of the redemption and how God can change lives - from an 11 time felon and drug addict to a highly respected member of what is arguably the one of best and most elite military teams in the world. I don't post much on Facebook but after I finished reading this book I felt compelled to recommend it to my friends.<br /><br />I have read some of Blehm's other books and thoroughly enjoyed them as well. Reading Fearless has convinced me that I need to read the rest of his books. This one is a wonderfully told, well organized and very compelling story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting puzzles, cool graphical interface. The goal of this game is to move on to the next level/floor/room and in order to do that you'll need access to the switch that opens the door to the elevator (for those who don't know what to do). There are clues in the pictures, floral arrangements, colors placements that you'll need to zoom in to figure out. Once you have solved one puzzle, you'll need to use the result to solve another puzzle until you finally have the piece to activate the switch to the elevator. Despite a few minor bugs, I'll be awaiting new levels.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is simple yet addicting and...FREE!!! When I got this game I though I would delete  this game after a while but I love this game and will not delete it ever.
1451648537|5.0|We selected this book for our small wine and book club.  Some were concerned because the book is almost 600 pages.  But it is a good read and I could not put it down.  Because I had a personal perspective of Steve Jobs from meetings I had with him back in 1979 and 1980 I was surprised how truthful the author was in dealing with a difficult personality.  At times Steve Jobs could be charming, more often he was driven and difficult to deal with.  The book really filled in a complete picture of someone who really did change the world.  I am sorrow he died early but the book brings a new light on how his driven personality and weird eating obsessions might have lead to his cancer becoming terminal.
B005XN3150|4.0|We've only just finished the first season.  It's a great show.  Not as good as \\"Breaking Bad, \\"Justified\\" or \\"Sopranos\\" so I can't give it 5 stars, but a solid 4 for sure.<br /><br />I didn't read fairytales growing up so my wife has to be my technical advisor while we watch it.  Haha, not kidding.  It's funny when I have to pause it to ask, \\"Now who did Red Riding Hood fight with; is it the same wolf that was after Goldie and the Pigs\\".  lol  She gets a kick out of me more than the show I think.<br /><br />Anyhow, I really enjoy it.  She loves it.  I do get a little annoyed at how slow or how \\"family-friendly\\" it can be at times.  But that's to be expected.  It is based upon the fairytales of your childhood - well most people's childhood anyway.  And it does have to create a series so me feeling it's moving slowly is just my lack of patience for the Queen to............  Ooooops, almost a spoiler.  Sorry, but you'll have to watch it.<br /><br />I like it.  I like how one world's story is told \\"moving forward\\" while the other's is told usually \\"moving backwards\\".  I like Rumple. An amazing character.  Kinda cool too how the main character (not the Queen) is only in one world.  All the other actors have to play at least 2 characters.  That's really cool to watch.<br /><br />Buy it, rent it.  You'll like it.  And if you actually know the childhood fairytales, you'll probably love it....deary.  ;-)
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was such a hilarious read! I enjoyed reading every page. I laughed out loud so many times while reading it that I had to start reading the excerpts I loved (which there were a LOT) to my brother & HE loved her writing, too! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a fresh, sarcastic, witty, and all-around fun read!
B00BN3DPQ4|1.0|Awful, just really really awful.  I expected something goofy, but mildly entertaining.  This was neither.  It was just plain awful.  I cannot believe people actually get money to create garbage like this.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|this is a MUST see movie, great action & funny scenes. keeps you in your seat for sure!  can't  wait  for  the  sequel  to  comes  out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think interest is awesome because you can look up what u want and it is really easy to post and stuff. THE END
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app.  Tells me exactly the amount of time I have left on the web, music, reading etc.... Would not want to be without this app.
B008D36INE|5.0|If you are a Tom Hiddleston fan you will enjoy this side of his acting skills. I will see it again.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|the old app was great and simple. you cant even see the wording in the new app due to stupid background.
0375815260|5.0|Read it to my 7 year old grandchild and we loved every moment of it. She has not been spoiled by seeing the movie first. So her original imagination skills were well challenged. Her giggles and comments were priceless.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Riveting and thought provoking.  Glen Close was a welcome addition but all the characters played important roles in this series.
B0061S073A|5.0|This works perfectly on both my Kindle and my Android; the kids have a selection of games they can play, and I don't have to worry about them getting into anything else.  (It's not a privacy thing, it's protection--it's amazing  how quickly that toddler can remove items from my calendar or call back the phone number I was avoiding!).  The best part is that even if they manage to get back to the main screen, the program kicks them back into Kids Place.
1400031001|5.0|I am still reading \\"Any Human Heart\\". I looked for the book because I watched the BBC series.<br /><br />The book is so detailed, in a diary format. It is different from the series and I am really enjoying reading about this protagonists life.<br /><br />It seems as though it is a non-fiction and is so intertwined with events that did happen that you forget this man did not exist in real life.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Great game lots of fun and I love the dragons my favorite part is trying to catch the jewels in the pots at the bottom.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I Like It Cause It Cleans Up My Tasks, But I Can Never Tell The Difference Of It Being Clean Or Dirty ! But I Guess It Is Doing A Good Job Because I Have Not Yet Got Any Type Of Virus !
B008C20TDG|5.0|After hearing about Whole30 a lot I decided to read about it myself so I could make an informed decision.  It all made sense to me. My fitness and nutrition is constantly evolving as I continually educate myself on ways to obtain optimal health.  The concepts in It Starts With Food have taken me to an even higher level of consciousness about what I put in my body.  I just completed the Whole30, I feel great and plan on continuing to eat the same way!
B00632HWOG|4.0|I Love Yahoo! It Shows Me All My Mail And Still Bring Up Spam Just In Case It Was An Accident !
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This was a great little piece of fluff. The superheroes demonstrated that they are not perfect and have their own issues. Still left with a happy feeling at the end.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Its Cool But I Don't Like How It Tells You What Everyone Does ! Its Like A Snitch or Fed Low Key ! Its A Cool Site But Its Kind Of Nosey In My Eyes. But I Got One So ... !
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I like this game although I still don't know what a plane and paper with pencil make. wish me luck lol
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Reads PDFs from the internet and my computer with no problems. I'd highly recommend it, you never know when you're going to download an e-mail attachment or something from a website in PDF format.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Been using Evernote for a couple of years now. Use it on PC, Mac, Apple IOS as well as of course Kindle HD. Works seemless between all devices as well as clipping widgets. Recommend for both business and personal uses.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I can't believe this movie or the book is for young people.  Too much violence, bullying, children killing children.  No wonder we have problems in this world!
B005K17RU0|4.0|i found this more detailed than the weather bug. and mor informative with maps etc.<br />user friendly also. good idea to check out both but my personal choice having used both apps!!
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King is a treasure. His characters come alive as soon as they start to speak and the stories he tells, rich, insightful, surprising, satisfying, are impossible to put down and stay with the reader long after the book has been passed on to a favorite husband.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|grandson plays it often but it continuously downloads additions and takes up time on my kindle. You cannot stop the downloads once they have started.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was definitely a repeat of the first book, but still gripping and erotic. I guess Jack isn't done yet. He's not leaving quietly!! Glad to see Ana standing up to Mrs. Robinson and throwing that cocktail in her face...priceless! Cannot wait to see how it ends!!
B000NA28I4|4.0|The movie was good but I was disappointed not more of the wonderful book was included but then the movie would have been longer.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I liked the book very much but when I got the the chapters around 1940 the first page was missing from each chapter. so that was disappointing.
B00471TLZS|1.0|Everytime I get a movie from Amazon Prime, it is grainy and a terrible picture.  It is a waste of money to download movies and pay for them.
B000HF2NTE|5.0|Awesome flick! I remember watching this back when I was a kid at the movies back in the 80s. I wish they made more movies like this.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|It is pretty difficult, but fun. Multiple levels of<br />multiple levels of difficulty make it more enjoyable.<br /><br />pretty hard to put down.
B006LSZECO|5.0|An exciting murder mystery with a twist that will keep you turning the pages long after you should have gone to sleep! I couldn't put this book down.
0316017930|5.0|I loved outliers, one of my leadership teacher suggested me and it was totally worth it! Malcom, explains really well and establishes good examples of success stories.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Nola Wylie goes a great job as leader of a<br />Human Resistance Force against the Alien<br />Invasion! His three sons provide an interesting<br />&#34;family&#34; element to the series.
0316010669|4.0|I read months before Outliers, and because outliers was a good book, I assumed Blink would be good too, but Blink is a mix of different articles and events, not establishing a unique idea of \\"Blink: The Power of Thinking...
B001V9LPY4|5.0|My Neighbour Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, Castle In The Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service but where is Spirited Away? Studio Ghibli needs to release it onto Blu-ray
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I love this movie as well as Captain america, thor, and Iron Man 2. This item came much sooner than I expected!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I bought a copy of \\"Building Your Book for Kindle\\" because late in 2012 and early this year I was writing a book about my late wife Kathy and our life together. It was something I had wanted to do ever since my wife passed away from cancer in 2001, but didn't really know how to do it. This book gave me the guidance I needed. Early this year my book (\\"A Journal of Unresolved Grief\\")was published both on Kindle and in paperback form at Amazon, which I am very proud of. It has beenm said the everyone has at least one book in them, and this book was mine. I couldn't have done it without \\"Building Your Book for Kindle,\\" and I am eternally grateful for the help I received during the writing and publishing process.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. Its easy to learn and very fun to play and extremely addictive. I would recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles.
B009GX6TMA|5.0|Watched the 1st season on netflix and this 2nd one continues off great. Excellent character show, their lives get even more interesting and are still hilarious.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Totally addicted it keeps you guessing. Love the dialogue and the energy between the characters<br />Can't wait for the next seasons
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because when you get coins you can get charectors,powerups, and mystery boxes. That's why I like it.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|It was not what I wanted - I wanted the game Candy Crush - not the help guide - useless to me

1476734941|5.0|I saw the Fast Diet on a PBS TV program and decided to try it.  I'd let myself go from 185 pounds to 205 and did not like the result.  Hiking Colorado mountains was much difficult.  Since starting the two-day per week fast three months ago I've lost 18 pounds.  Hiking is much easier now.  I'm not the slow one.  Only 6 more pounds to go.  Once I reach my target 180 pounds, I expect one day per week will work as a maintenance program to keep me there.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|great buy and fit my dad perfectly.. nice material and length! Went back and bought another in a different color!

B00874T02K|5.0|This workout,  which it is, even though your not using weight,  is a great way to jolt your muscles if you feel stagnant, like I was. It is definitely a good workout wether you are just starting or exp like myself. Stick with their program and you will definitely see results in 6 Weeks! Great stuff!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it better then world craft and world block! It is worth the money and there's an updated version of mindcraft pocket edition! And your kids will be on your phone for EVER I mean it for EVER ! So get the app only 7$

B00AKKS278|4.0|Really enjoyed the practical &#34;Life S.A.V.E.R.S.&#34;. I also appreciated the bonus materials available through your website. Thanks so much for your book.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great book, Khaled Hosseini has yet again written a great book again.  Moving story and very smooth. I recommend it.
B00004RJ71|5.0|Blood In, Blood Out is really good and realistic its a great gangster movie they didnt make to many as good as this, American Me is the only other one thats as good as this. a must see!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|odd movie, good twist yet a little odd.  This was a good movie for jury duty (I downloaded the movie to pass the time)
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins' books are always great, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Read it in a weeknd, since I couldn't put it down!!!
B00DJUPLY8|5.0|Back when I started adopting Android, I found it hard to run Shoutcast TV through my devices (in fact, WinAmp discontinued support for Shoutcast TV a while ago), and there were no practical players. However, GoodPlayer allows you to stream pretty much everything as long as you provide it with an URL, so there it's a little irritating to use, in order to add Shoutcast TV streams, you have... To... Enter... Every... Single... Number of the URL for it to play. Good part though is that it doesn't have to be entered every time, your entries are saved easily.<br /><br />So now I'm watching MST3K shoutcasts on my TV, or my netbook, wherever I want. Thanks!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show is the first to paint the bleak reality of urban Ameica without resorting to to the cartoonish characters we are accustomed to seeing on tv.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|Tried playing it on my Jelly Bean based netbook, the game play screen was too small to be playable, the controls took up 4/5 of the 10&#34; screen, totally unusable unless you have the right platform.
B00847KFDS|4.0|Rating as 4 only because Forgerty did these songs so very well before.  The iconic, original versions can't be forgotten.<br /><br />On it's own this is solid end to end.  Great performances.  Great sound.  The mixed lineup of singers is not distracting (as it often can be) and Mr Fogerty tends to give the guest the lead.<br /><br />As reinterpreted, fresh versions of American rock classics the album seems as strong as ... Stones' Stripped, 10,000 Unplugged, and Pretenders Isle of View.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Never a dull moment. An easy read in a day. Keeps your interest from cover to cover. Intimate parts written appropriately.
1476734941|5.0|Easy to do and it works. Passed the book around the office. Co-worker lost 12 inches in about 6 weeks. First diet she ever had any success. We use it to keep our weight in control.
1401938906|5.0|This book makes you understand and experiment so easy and quick that the result pops infront of your face almost inmediatly, there's no way to refuse it and it's very easy to adopt the learning in your daily life.<br /><br />Definitely, after reading this book, you won't have any excuse to live or feel bad, because all the tools for changing whatever makes you unhappy are set in there, simply wonderful!
B004FOA84A|4.0|The clues were reasonable. I only missed one. Probably about 2 hours play time. Easily worth the $.99 price charged
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I knew it would be sad but wow, what a turn that I did not expect. Love Augustus! Sadly wish for a happy ending even though it wouldn't have made sense
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think accuweather is an easy app to find your way around in. And they seem to be the most accurate in predictions.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have been watching and catching up on all of the season of Downton Abbey and I am so enjoying it. The connection on my Kindle through Amazon is great--no commercials. I highly recommend th series and PRIME.
B001MM28JG|5.0|Loosely based upon a Star Trek fan story entitled &#34;Visit to a Planet Revisited&#34;, this movie, starring Tim Allen and a host of others, is about how the stars of a science fiction television show, end up on a real starship.  The simple, but trusting aliens apparently have been watching &#34;historical tapes&#34; of the show, thinking that universe was very real, and modeled their society and technology upon it.  When they are repeatedly attacked by a hostile society, they convince Tim Allen's character and the rest of the &#34;crew&#34; to play their parts to chase off the bad guys.  Loads of fun, lots of laughs, -- a fun movie for the family and Star Trek fans.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Action packed! Don't take this movie to serious and you will enjoy the action and all the cameos from action films.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|When you hear..\\"For God and Country \\" its hard not to feel sad and at the same time proud to be an American
B003TXKSWK|1.0|The musicianship is good - I mean, we ARE talking about the Roots AND John Legend here -  but the body of music is largely unimpressive. Much of it is rap-like (not my thing). The rest are sappy messages to the ghetto world. Look, it's not that many people don't need to be inspired, and hear a positive message - it's just that I don't want to pay to hear you do it. Put YOUR money into some inner-city youth programs, and out-reach programs.<br /><br />When I put MY money in to a John Legend album, I wanna hear neo-soul, and when I put MY money in to a Roots album, I wanna hear crazy funk. If you guys wanna play what's in your soul, I'll buy the albums (yeah, I mean buy, not &#34;download&#34;), but if you wanna preach what's on your mind, start your own church, your own cult, or some out-reach programs, but I am NOT gonna pay for someone's personalized agenda, wrapped in a backbeat of poor musicianship!<br /><br />John Legend? I'm a huge fan!<br />The Root? I'm a huge fan?<br /><br />Wake Up? I couldn't flush it down the toilet quickly enough....
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|love it. its way to addictive this is totally woth it.so get this game now and enjoy it because its awsome and FREE
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|He loved season one and of course thinks season two is the best  He has been a fan since the first episode All I can say is if you love zombies youll love this
B0095BFO0Q|5.0|This is a great movie showing with a touch of humor reality of Vatican politics.<br />For all those who were surprised with the changes in Vatican earlier this year, they might find some answers in the movie.<br />Perfect play by the actors.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable fixed all the problems we were having charging our Kindle's. The customer service is AWESOME!!! They will help anyway they can!!!
B005LAII0I|5.0|How could a fun fairy tale like Snow White be improved upon?  Well, it has been!  Great acting by everyone involved, spectacular sets, plenty of action, great scripting, and the story line is so fun!  I had to buy it so I could watch it again and again!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|most moms /w adult sons will identify/w Ms Streisand's character...loved the movie!  i highly recommend watching this thoroughly entertaining movie.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I remember the old days of Bond with women half-clad and Bond super macho...not in an appealing way (to me); however, I was impressed to see this version of Bond.  He has become a man who still doesn't know how to commit to a woman, but &#34;sexy&#34; scenes were left to my imagination instead of being shoved in my face.  The language, other than using the holy name of Jesus like a common curse, was not objectionable.  Aside of the gratuitous homosexual reference, the movie was done in better taste than prior versions.  Great action scenes!!!  And...it even had a plot!
B009ZQCT6S|4.0|The conflict felt really forced, but it is a cute movie and a fun time. I loved the witty dialogue.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|This was even better than the first movie, in my opinion.  Fun in every way for adults and for kids!
B000VZYVOK|5.0|Used to listen to this album all the time. And is still one of my favorites. A lot of mellow tracks to relax to!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Another Awesome Tarantino master piece. A must see, don't wait. Perfectly cast. Great performances by all.  This is one of the few movies I will watch multiple times.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I fell in love with Babel from the first day i heard it. Sigh No More was good, but the band outdid itself with this new release.<br />Such lovely songs. A good amount of upbeat banjo and a fair amount of soft melodies.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|For a Sci Fi movie, this was fascinating. Though it was after the SECOND viewing that I really got to grasp the movie as a whole. The thought behind it and the plot truly were GREAT and one of the better ones I have seen in a long time
B009ANP48G|1.0|i was only able to watch half the movie before it got al pixilated and kept freezing. cant return it now aparently, even though i just found out about this problem. no scratchesor anything, just wont work right.
0738737909|5.0|The Tarot Illuminati deck is absolutely beautiful and I would recommend it.  However, it's my opinion that this is a deck for the experienced reader and not for a beginner.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This App is fun to play for the whole family.  My kids and I play together and they love it.
B009P13RQY|5.0|A great album from start to finish... has shades of black sabbath but stands on it's own. Not a bad song to be found. on this one.... Well produced.
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|This movie portrayed what greed will lead a man to do. It also portrayed how good will eventually overcome evil.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I am really enjoying this show.  Gabriel Macht is awesome, and the brief glimpses into his character's humanity in this season are interesting and well-timed.  I sort of miss the &#34;teamwork&#34; aspect that seemed to be burgeoning in season 1, as Harvey and Mike seem to be basically at odds now.  The supporting cast are all phenomenal and make it such a fun world to visit.  I am also glad they moved past &#34;Mike's Secret&#34; being the main focus of each plot and we got to have the P-H civil war.  All in all, it is good enough that I will likely purchase Season 3 for streaming and will then be sad when I catch up and have no new episodes to watch.
B005QBBC2S|4.0|I say it is sad because it is a story of two extremely dysfunctional people falling for each other. It is kind of a tear jerker.
B000JCQCW4|2.0|Very sad to see the cycle of drug addiction from mother to son. I felt like there was no closure in this movie.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Who cares who's in it. What matters is the fact that this movie was well written and acted. Dustin Hoffman outdid himself on this one.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Beautiful movie and I want to go live there.  The music WAS the movie for me and it was about something that we all face from all perspectives---AGING.  Some do it better than others and for those who do not, look closely and there is someone to help you.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|If you do not want to be subjected to a Superman like adventure, then do not waste your time on this movie. It is not very original.
0345529057|5.0|This series is fantastic for readers of all levels and the books themselves are of high quality. You will not be able to stop reading once you've started!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Wonderful app. Sometimes runs slow. Runs best off of a Wi-Fi connection. Use it everyday! Better than the Facebook application, But harder to find people on twitter
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is defiantly worth getting,there was a little trouble with hackers making servers sync which was very frustrating but definitely the best game out there right now!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun. I could stay up all night and day playing this game. I really think that anyone that enjoys temple  run or even the Despicable me movies would adore this game! I am glad that this game is available because it's awesome. :)
030758836X|5.0|Could not put down!! Very entertaining .  Should be made into a movie!  Many twists and turns and keeps you wondering....
B001RONJYC|4.0|I enjoy the history of the movie and the studio chess records.<br />the racial issues and struggles black musicians had to deal with was interesting and made me think about how things have changed since then.<br />the movie  claims to be based on true stories,but if you do some research online not all of it is true.<br />im sure some changes were needed to make the movie more interesting.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|This movie is just OMG Fantastic.....I'm 14 and I watch this movie at least once a week. This movie is one of the best Tim Burton movies of all time. My mom saw it two times in the theatre, once with me and once by herself, she also loves this movie. Coraline is a must see movie of all ages, though some of the images could be a little creepy for the younger ones!!!! Hope this was helpful!!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Reminds me off playing as a kid. I play this game with my kids, awesome way to have family fun.
0525478817|5.0|This book is a must read!!! It made me laugh and cry all at the same time.......John Green put everything in such a good way that it blew my mind &lt;3. You will NOT be disappointed in buying and reading this book.Its definitely not a waste of money.
B000I3PA8Q|4.0|As a lifelong fan of the original Star Trek tv shows I enjoy most of the movies (not I & V) with the original cast.  This is no exception.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Loved it. Better than you would expect on MTV.  I can't wait for season 2.  Too much sex for a teen based comedy.
B005R32L66|4.0|I binge watched the two seasons of Alphas and was disappointed that it ended. Although, the last episode was very much a finale. (no spoiler... watch it!)
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Super cool out of this word fun fun for hours and hours and hours you really really really will fall in love with this game just try it out.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I used a HeadRoom Little made circa 1998 at my desk for 15 years before it decided to kick the bucket. I replaced it with this, and I'm very happy. I thought I would miss the cross-feed of the HeadRoom, but I don't. The Fiio has excellent sound quality, comes with a bunch of useful cables and other accessories, is tiny, and also has a nice built in DAC. Throw in the ability to use USB or toslink, and at this price what's not to love? What flaws it does have are minor: Volume and EQ steps are not as granular as I would like, the fact that you have to press a volume button once before either volume button will respond is a little annoying (presumably it's intended to prevent accidental volume presses, but that's what the hold switch is for), and... that's about it. Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game entertaining without being stupid cant wait for more rooms grew few. low kohl Comm def you hi jump
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|My household does not subscribe to cable television.  So, the Chromecast was a no-brainer for $35.  I was lucky enough to snag one right at launch.  The setup was simple and painless on my iPhone.  I was able to have it setup in just  few moments.  I've really been impressed with the NetFlix streaming from iOS.  My only complaint is that some of the functionality is limited with Windows 8.  The streaming on this platform seems to be limited to the Chrome browser at this time.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Don't go Turbo, buy this amazing movie by Pixar to all gamers, with love. Really, this movie is honestly fantastic, I love LOVE Jane Lynch's character. Her flash backs might scare younger viewers but they are quick, hence &#34;flash back&#34;. Her flash backs are basically the most amazing scenes through out the movie, which is really hard to say since this movie is just perfect.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I never noticed her scar til I read about it in the book...<br /><br />She sounds like someone who works too hard and needs to take some time and relax!<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who has watched SNL because it is very insightful.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I was one of lucky few bronies that lived near one of the early theater showings, and I loved every bit of this movie. Sure, Hasbro made it to make more money but I'm happy to make this trade for a great product. The visuals are great, the colors are mesmerizing, and the songs are memorable. I've had numerous songs from the movie stuck in my head for weeks. I've been waiting for this blu-ray longer than anything this year.<br /><br />With all this said, there is a strange audio difference between the blu-ray and the digital copy. The digital copy's audio sounds like the movie is being played through a window, it sounds distant. My only guess is that the file is of lower quality to keep costs down. The blu-ray's audio is perfect, I watched it three times in a row just to make sure. Just to make sure.
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|This movie is nothing like the original movie.  I found the original movie to be comical.  I guess the point of the original movie was to be part comedy.  I am a fan of true horror movies that work to terrify you and gross you out.  I wasn't terrified, but I was definitely grossed out.
B00447G29S|5.0|A Great gift for anyone at anytime of year -  The movie tears at your heart strings with love, happiness and friendship that will warm your heart from bottom to top.  A well acted and presented feature, giving us all a reason to remember Christmas or anytime in our life where things changed and never were the same again.  3D adds to the personal feeling and of course the BELL, Can you still hear it ringing??  Buy this one, you won't be sorry you did!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this movie!<br />The acting is exceptional and the stories are touching.<br />I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|A twist and Turn movie that will have you squirming fro more!  3D is AMAZING ad well as the art and backdrops.  I loved the story line and most of all the PRIEST who in the end proves the &#34;GOOD WILL WIN OVER EVIL&#34;
B007SGM084|5.0|I love it makes me image me and my boyfriend having dirty sex. It gave me the courage to try other thing  with my boyfriend
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|Blood, Gore and a Thriller done in very good taste.  An amazing trip through he land of the Dead and Living with jokes and on the edge of your seat action.  If you love Blood Suckers than this is your movie, good to the very last BITE!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game so much fun I love these minion and it does not hurt that its free a++++ game
B005I64U5C|5.0|One of the BEST movies of this type; received very little praise when in the Theaters however, at Home on your 3D T.V. this movie ROCKS!  Very good acting together with a good story and great action, makes this a MUST HAVE MOVIE for your collection.  Buy it! and enjoy the FUN!!
0316776963|4.0|This book is a light-hearted memoir.  Somewhere in the first 50 pages the author goes on about drug use, which turned me off....but by the next chapter it improves. Later he pokes fun at himself and some of his own idiosyncrasies and his thoughts that made me laugh out loud.  I especially enjoyed his stories about his trips to Paris.  I enjoyed the book mostly for the humorous thoughts and tales told.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This is very similar to the old Tetris as the name implies but with some added twists. A lot of fun and definitely worth the purchase if you like puzzle games. Comes with a tutorial as well to introduce you to the simple game play
055358202X|4.0|This series got me interested because of the HBO show. There are some places where the author could have written more tightly but overall you can't question his story-telling abilities. Really nice story. The last book had a lot of surprises. This one doesn't have as many and I suppose you do need to let the story develop a bit. Looking forward to reading book 5.
0684857219|5.0|What insights this book provided into just how much of Arnold went into the craft of body building as we know it today.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|its an awesome app but you have to pay for some people and everything else is fun so i recomend this app
B000ELJBAA|5.0|David Gilmour's album &#34;On An Island&#34; is his Magnum Opus.  It is the end result of 50 years of playing professionally.  But he didn't always sound that way, because the last 50 years have been a learning process.  It is fun to hear just how he developed his famous style.  I will say this - he has always been one hell of a guitar player.  He just went from great to god-like in his craft.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome everything is good except the fact that in creative you cant blow up tnt and there should be cars boats planes and minecars
B00136RZUI|5.0|This album is the Mozart of Rock.  It is the culmination of 50 years of professional guitar playing.  Anyone who is a Pink Floyd fan should listen to this body of work.  It is nothing short of magnificent, and the beauty of several of the guitar passages actually brought me to tears while mowing the grass with headphones on.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the most addictive games I have ever played, it is so much fun and who doesn't love the minions :)
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I really did enjoy this movie. It was filled with visual wonders, great acting and even love. There were triumphs, tragedies, and even plot twists that kept me watching this entire movie. I'm a big sci-fi fan, but even if you aren't, give this movie a try. It left me with thoughts of future tech powers and even a sadness at what we might become. Besides Tom Cruise's fine acting, there is also an excellent supporting cast, notably, Morgan Freeman.
B00005JSGK|5.0|Doubt me if you want but I think this is one of the Duke's best movies.  It is not even a western!
140006922X|1.0|Like all others who do not believe in Christ or understand. They are blind to the peace and joy that I have found in Christ. Of course he does not believe Christ is our only way to heaven. He is spiritually blind. I pray that the Holy Spirit convicts his heart and find the real truth about Christ. The peace and joy you have when you ask him into your life and put your life in his hand is the greatest thing one can do. We are in a spiritual war, not against humans but the fallen angel who is the great deceiver.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I can't say that I like this book. It is morose, defeated, grey and down-right depressing. It is well-written, but the world that is created is so awful that I couldn't really place myself there.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Creative story but kinda pointless. Not my favorite. Good writing but story didn't really take me anywhere. All little too much fantasy for me.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Good movie for the whole family. Rango is hilarious as are most of the other characters; Johnny Depp does a fantastic job as usual. Nice Fear and Loathibg reference that only parents will get ;)
B000YMM3CC|4.0|Excellent movie I love this movie a must buy!!! Your boyfriend best friend anyone you choose will love to watch this movie with you! And im a adult and I will watch when im a elder!
B003G4W49C|5.0|this is one of the the best books, read it few times over the years<br />rated in my top 10
B0057URWSQ|5.0|Great timing, chemistry, wordplay and interesting characters.  Why haven't I heard about this?  We are hooked midway thru season one!  Greg
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series is just lovely to watch, it really makes one feel good.  The characters are finely drawn and beautifully acted.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't wait for the next one to come out! so many amazing story lines and character arcs! Thanks grrm.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|It is a good futuristic movie with lots of twists.  It kept our interest the entire movie.  Would highly recommend this movie!
B00E193TM2|5.0|Five finger DP has never disappointed. Great heavy metal for anytime. Will continue to buy their albums as long as they keep making them.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|This is the definite album in U2's career. The band's history is divided into 'before' and 'after' The Joshua Tree. In their own words, this album represented U2's discovery of America and its musical tradition. Namely, 'blues'. Bono has stated more than once that The Joshua Tree was an attempt by a handful of clumsy Irishmen to make American blues music.<br />Personally, I don't know about that. I just know this album is close to perfect and this Super Deluxe Edition is a fan's dream.<br />I've been a fan of U2 for over 25 years and I felt like weeping when I opened my box. It's a treasure. The artwork is gorgeous, the pictures are awesome, the box is elegant. I could just go on and on.<br />If you Still Haven't Bought this box, I strongly urge you to do so. You won't regret it!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun and I love the minions. When you poke them they make weird faces. Log ed this game.
B005FVA3LK|5.0|'Achtung Baby', along with 'The Joshua Tree', are the albums that defined the band. And, may I add, a great deal of bands after that due to their influence.<br />The creativity and the power of their music in this album are undeniable.<br />And this pack is the ultimate collector's wet dream. The pictures and the book are GORGEOUS. The DVds are sensationa. The Zoo Station Tour was a landmark in U2's career but the concert in Sydney is historical. And the songs are just amazing.<br />Hence the title - it is JUST PERFECT.<br />Even if you already own an Achtung Baby CD and you are a fan of the band you MUST have this pack.<br />I recommend this product because it's worth every single cent I paid for it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this app because you can actually experience the care of a horse. It is very interactive. I like that. Plus, I love horses, so I wanted an app that I could take care of one.
B008JFUN50|4.0|After Diego Luna's Julio tries to convince Matt Damon's Max to help him steal cars to no avail, Julio yells to Max, \\"You used to be a legend!\\" Words that sci-fi fans may be repeating towards director Neill Blomkamp after viewing his newest effort \\"Elysium.\\" Neill Blomkamp made his directorial debut with the excellent sci-fi film \\"District 9,\\" which was also the feature film debut of South African actor Sharlto Copley. With excellent special effects, a surprisingly powerful story, and an absolutely heartbreaking ending, \\"District 9\\" brought faith back to the science fiction genre. \\"Elysium\\" is Blomkamp's second film which presumably has been in the works for the past four years, so there is a lot to live up to. Initially being quite pleased with \\"Elysium,\\" in retrospect it really doesn't come close to being as much of an absorbing experience as \\"District 9.\\"<br /><br />There really isn't any arguing that \\"Elysium\\" visually looks very much like \\"District 9.\\" Viewing the film as a standalone film rather than a follow-up to a superb debut feature is extremely difficult, but is a practice that should be executed more often. The characters seem very black and white as the more unfortunate individuals are very hard-working and caring while the better off tend to look down on everyone and only care about themselves. But if you take a closer look, then things are a little more unusual. While there are still several different cultures left on Earth, Matt Damon seems to be the only Caucasian person who hasn't made it to Elysium while it seems as though only Caucasian individuals reside on the space station.<br /><br />Jodie Foster portrays Delacourt; the senator of Elysium who takes command whenever a war-like situation develops. While the Elysium population is stereotypical rich folk, Delacourt seems to be the most pompous individual ever. Jodie Foster has this ridiculous accent that isn't even consistent or logical. There is literally no purpose behind it. Meanwhile John Carlyle (William Fichtner) is a resident from Elysium left to run the droid manufacturing warehouse Max works at who apparently knows how to develop some really destructive software. Delacourt hires him to basically help her turn Elysium upside down and leave her in charge. The issue is that Carlyle seems like a complete push over and if that software had been available this entire time, why didn't he try to do it himself? Why didn't anyone else think of it?<br /><br />Switching gears a bit and coming back to \\"District 9,\\" at least the weapons in \\"District 9\\" were creative and unique. The weapons in \\"Elysium\\" look intriguing and are usually quite flashy, but always have the same result which usually sees the human body erupting in a blood explosion of some kind. The exo-suits are fun as are the explosive rounds and a particular slow-motion sequence involving a droid, but it seems like you see the same weapon over and over again throughout the film. Although a certain facial reconstruction is handled extremely well.<br /><br />This may be coming off like a negative review, but it's actually constructive criticism more than anything. \\"Elysium\\" feels like 2013's \\"Prometheus\\" and while \\"Elysium\\" is the better film, it'll likely leave many disappointed since \\"Elysium\\" isn't the film that \\"District 9\\" was and still is. The droids are fantastic, the parole officer scene is amusing, and the contrast between Earth and Elysium is fascinating to ponder; Earth being portrayed as dirty and grungy while Elysium is very neat, clean, and prosperous. Kruger starts off as an interesting villainous character, but fizzles out near the end. He's an agent that gets released and wants his job back, but he's clearly just a drifter who's psychotic and likes to rape women. Why he's so hell bent on his career is kind of baffling. Did they have really good benefits? Did he not have a chance to get proper references? Certain concepts tickle the film fan in you like Matilda's (Emma Tremblay's) meerkat story, hijacking brain data, and Max and Frey's childhood being a returning story point. Everything leading up to Max's exo-suit surgery, the surgery itself at Spider's (Wagner Moura), and the John Carlyle ambush are arguably the high points of the film.<br /><br />\\"Elysium\\" has some really cool concepts that include shades of \\"Terminator 2,\\" \\"Aliens,\\" and the more obvious choice of \\"District 9,\\" but the disappointing aspect is that it just doesn't live up to \\"District 9.\\" Despite \\"Elysium\\" trying to have a strong message, it doesn't impact your emotions the same way \\"District 9\\" did. The film leaves you torn about its performances, about its ending, and just about everything regarding the film in general. \\"Elysium\\" is extremely genuine at heart, but its story structure is so futuristically torqued that nothing seems to affect you the way that it should.kat story, hijacking brain data, and Max and Frey's childhood being a returning story point.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really awesome and I think they should make A million Apps because this is Good for minecraft fans. And A time cutter, it makes time go by fast and it just updated to 0.7.2 and the new update is amazing. I don't know what else to say about it.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|it is funny and silly.  i like all the characters, especially the minions.  (written by my son, a 6 year-old)
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Beach Buggy Blitz, is a very fun game but it would be way better if it had MULTIPLAYER but it doesn't so that why it starts to get boring after a while.
B00371XIJE|5.0|Beautiful!  And if you need to cry...see this movie.  A story of true and deep love.  Performances were very good
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I liked it you play with people you can be like got you and not to a computer you think person to person not to a predictable computer
B00A27X972|4.0|I normally do not read  fiction however this work provides a delightful and insightful view of many characteristics of humans which are both humorous and informative.  We do strange things !  I suggest a reading with an open and appreciative mind.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I do enjoy this show, but I loved Boston Legal which was quite a bit better.  Louis Litt is probably the most interesting character!  You hate him then you like him then you feel soooo sorry for him.  I think in real life I would be his friend.  (lol that's the wine talking!)
0064471837|5.0|In a lot of dark fantasy books, necromancers--people who bring the dead back to life--are a commonplace, and the stereotype portrayal is that they are subordinates of the devil. Garth Nix is perhaps the first one to think outside the box by creating his Old Kingdom trilogy, where the protagonists are necromancers not of the common kind. Whereas black magicians or ordinary necromancers revive dead people, Abhorsens put the risen Dead back to rest in order to protect the living.<br /><br />The trilogy commences with Sabriel (published in 1995). Most books under the fantasy umbrella has this clich&eacute;d kick-off where the protagonist lives in an ordinary world and then discovers a portal of some sort that leads to another dimension. In Sabriel, these two worlds are ever-present, important, and known to all; there is no door of any kind, but there's an enchanted Wall separating them. The setting is in two neighboring countries: first is Ancelstierre, where people live with the aid of simple technology akin to that of early 20th century England, and second is the Old Kingdom, where magic is real and mythical creatures abound. Apparently the Ancelstierran Government denies the existence of anything extraordinary beyond their side of the wall; only people who know Charter Magic are allowed to cross to other side. In Old Kingdom, no form of technology will function because of Charter and Free magic lingering in the air, and people are more or less ignorant about science.<br /><br />The title character is the daughter of the current Abhorsen and is studying in a school in Ancelstierre. Even if she grows up in an almost non-magical environment, Sabriel knows what lies beyond the Wall, and is aware about what happens to one after death. When a harbinger arrives in her dormitory to inform her that the Abhorsen is in trouble, she takes up arms (a bandolier of necromantic bells, a sword, Charter magic) and sets off to rescue her father. Along the way she meets Mogget, a cat-shaped Free Magic creature, and Touchstone, a bastard prince incarcerated as a wooden figurehead of a derelict ship. The two agreed to help Sabriel and in the process they must defeat the Dead Adept called Kerrigor.<br /><br />Garth Nix is one of the earliest authors that made science fiction and fantasy my cup of tea when it comes to literature (the earliest is, needless to say, Neil Gaiman). He managed to draw me in, not only by the world he has carefully established with a four-dimensional feel, but also by the plot-driven storyline that made the book a sure page-turner. He laid out the details with care so as not to confuse the readers with the rather complicated setting. Same with the magical items and creatures--each of the seven bells have their own magical peculiarities that will stick to your mind easily, and the creatures, which I personally filed under \\"Nixian\\" mythology, are defined in an almost chillingly real way.<br /><br />Starting the story in Ancelstierre is an effective way to bring the readers to the journey comfortably. It's been always like that: a fantasy book must begin with an element that the readers can identify with to provide a proper leverage before catapulting into the world of the unknown. Nix was able to do that successfully. It actually helps that Sabriel isn't a complete ignorant in the strange world; she already knows some mysteries of the Old Kingdom, yet needs more information that may help her accomplish her mission. The readers learn with her.<br /><br />The characters are well-shaped: Stubborn and rather impulsive Sabriel, the pale-skinned and raven-haired schoolgirl, gradually grows up to a more mature person as she takes the role of an Abhorsen-in-waiting. Touchstone, after being trapped in wooden form for two hundred years and knowing the foolish thing he did before he was cursed, tends to be a little unemotional and a bit servile, but he slowly emerges as a very helpful ally (and romantic interest?) as the story progresses.Mogget is Mogget, always sarcastic and blunt--the story wouldn't be the way it was without him.<br /><br />All in all, this not only the story of good versus evil--it is as well a bildungsroman of a young girl, discovering the responsibilities and opportunities that come with growing up. Most of all it tackles issue about fate: \\"Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?\\" It's been years since I read this book for the first time and just finished rereading it this morning. It never grows old, in my opinion.

B009GEEMLY|4.0|Better than expected. Best hulk out of the 3 movies he's been in.  A little slow in the beginning, but picked up steam by middle and end.
1939416019|1.0|I have read a huge amount of Fantasy books from a wide range of Authors and this series of book is about the worst I have ever read. This book could only ever appeal to a 10 year old but then the content would be inappropriate for some one so young!<br /><br />Whoever the editors of these books are also needs to be fired!!!<br />ridiculous phases like \\"He mounted up BEHIND her and enjoyed the feel as her arms held him tight\\" are rife through out the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had actually avoided watching this series because I had heard how addicting it is.  And, it is!!  Once I started watching it, I couldn't stop.  I watched all three seasons in about six days!  The settings are amazing, the acting is great, the dialogue is fantastic, and the stories are great with lots of twists!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best horse gameni have played so far. I'm hooked. I really like the graphics and the quality. I love the fact you can train your own horse and win cool prizes. Its a very enjoyable experiance.
B00D5O7BPU|2.0|It's O.K. for the first go-round. the graphics are great  but the weapons are few. Not much for the money.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was amazing how the 3 families stories intertwined. Didn't want to put it down.  I recommend this book wholeheartedly.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Definitely worth the watch. Plenty of laughs, and action. Enjoyed the contrast of good sarcasm, and explosions. Going top see the sequel at the theater tomorrow night.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game and one of my favorite parts is that you can ride the unicorn.... one of the things I don't like is that you can not earn coins from just the game.. you have to buy them.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|THE best musical.  I have repeatedly watched it and it gets better every time.  Highly recommend this video.  Just love it.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It the best game on the kindle far none. It has good maniacs with a goofy style that's pretty good. One down side that it has in app perusing. If u want to upgrade your gun u have to use gems. But it ok because 98% of the people in the game don't use in app perusing. cut still it by far the best fps game on the kindle.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|As with most of Mr. Follet's novels, I found this book far too short!  I read through it so fast that it felt more like a novella than a full novel.<br /><br />I'm a fan!  Can't seem to get enough of these books.  Always looking forward to the next one!

Timely synthesis of principles that are keys to liberation from complex personal illusions and cycles of suffering.<br /><br />The book is not an escape, will be no substitute for individual practice, and will not magically transport you to some final destination; that said, it is a wonderful contemporary guide for where you are and is a great help for those who feel vulnerable, isolated, or trapped in recurring issues, thoughts, or feelings.  I already own A New Earth and am sure it will be life-changing as well.<br /><br />I decided to give four stars to indicate my personal resistance and taste. The book is one of my favorite spiritual guides out of the many I've read. This one features some redundancy and an analogy that oversimplifies something I experience differently, so the missing star is simply indicative of my personal experience with life and individual experience with the writing itself. I highly recommend the book.
